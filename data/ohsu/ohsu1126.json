  ".W": "CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on a variety of cells including those of myeloid and lymphoid origin. CD44 is highly conserved among various species and is involved in the homing of lymphocytes and monocytes to lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and sites of inflammation. In the present study, we demonstrate that monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9F3, directed against murine phagocytic glycoprotein 1 (CD44) expressed on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), can trigger the lytic activity of CTLs and redirect CTL-mediated lysis to antigen-negative Fc receptor-positive target cells. Similar redirected lysis was also inducible using mAb MEL-14, directed against the lymphocyte homing receptor for endothelium (gp90MEL-14). The redirected lysis induced by mAbs 9F3 and MEL-14 was similar to that induced by mAbs against the alpha beta T-cell receptor or CD3. In contrast, mAbs directed against CD8, CD45R, and CD11a (LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) failed to evoke lytic activity. The current study demonstrates that CD44 and gp90MEL-14 molecules, in addition to participating in T-cell homing and adhesion, may play a major role in delivering the transmembrane signal to the CTL that triggers the lytic activity, even when the T-cell receptor is not occupied. Such a mechanism may account for the nonspecific tissue damage seen at sites of CTL-mediated inflammation.\r"

Deletion of a three amino acid sequence Asp-Ala-Gly, which is conserved in aphid-transmissible potyvirus isolates, abolished transmission. The mutation Ala----Thr in this triplet drastically reduced transmission, whereas the mutation Asp----Asn had no effect, and the mutation Asp----Lys consistently reverted to the wild-type residue. The mutation Lys----Glu, in the residue adjacent to the glycine of the triplet, drastically reduced transmission, whereas the mutation Gln----Pro, seven residues downstream from the glycine had no effect. Comparison of the sequences of other potyviruses suggests that the presence of a glycine residue at the third position of the Asp-Ala-Gly triplet is critical for aphid transmissibility and that certain changes in the residues adjacent to this position abolish or greatly reduce aphid transmissibility.\r"

RAK differs from the cloned rat brain K current, BK2 [McKinnon, D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8230-8236], by one amino acid at residue 411. RAK expressed in oocytes compares closely to the intrinsic adult rat atrial delayed-rectifier current measured by using whole-cell recording of single isolated cells. Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the channel in adult rat atrium, and to a lesser extent, in rat ventricle. IRAK activates with time constants ranging from 58 ms at -20 mV to 6 ms at +60 mV and does not show significant inactivation over 800 ms. It is blocked by 4-aminopyridine greater than barium much greater than tetraethylammonium chloride, which is similar to the relative potencies of these blockers on the native delayed rectifier current. We conclude that the main delayed rectifier K current in adult rat atria is virtually identical to a neuronal delayed rectifier, BK2.\r"

This paper examines a powerful electrical technique by which cell motion is quantitatively measured at the nanometer level. In this method, the cells are cultured on small evaporated gold electrodes carrying weak ac currents. A large change in the measured electrical impedance of the electrodes is observed when cells attach and spread on these electrodes. When the impedance is tracked as a function of time, fluctuations are observed that are a direct measure of cell motion. Surprisingly, these fluctuations continue even when the cell layer becomes confluent. By comparing the measured impedance with a theoretical model, it is clear that under these circumstances the average motions of the cell layer of 1 nm can be inferred from the measurements. We refer to this aspect of cell motility as micromotion.\r"

Forty-seven patients, aged 29 to 91 years, with 50 stage II, III, and IV ulcers were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (n = 26) or a control (sham treatment) group (n = 24). Treated wounds received 30 minutes of pulsed cathodal electrical stimulation twice daily at a pulse frequency of 128 pulses per second (pps) and a peak amplitude of 29.2 mA if the wound contained necrotic tissue or any drainage that was not serosanguinous. A saline-moistened nontreatment electrode was applied 30.5 cm (12 in) cephalad from the wound. This protocol was continued for 3 days after the wound was debrided or exhibited serosanguinous drainage. Thereafter, the polarity of the treatment electrode on the wound was changed every 3 days until the wound progressed to a stage II classification. The pulse frequency was then reduced to 64 pps, and the treatment electrode polarity was changed daily until the wound was healed. Patients in the control group were treated with the same protocol, except they received sham electrical stimulation. After 4 weeks, wounds in the treatment and control groups were 44% and 67% of their initial size, respectively. The healing rates per week for the treatment and control groups were 14% and 8.25%, respectively. The results of this study indicate that pulsed electrical stimulation has a beneficial effect on healing stage II, III, and IV chronic dermal ulcers.\r"

The issue first arose and continues to be discussed in regard to those patients who have contracted AIDS through homosexual encounters, though there are now additional populations of patients with AIDS to whom the issue is being directed as well. We examine three lines of reasoning that may be advanced to support this view: the argument from morality, the argument from responsibility, and the argument from the alleged danger to others. We show logical and ethical shortcomings in each view and suggest how the physical therapist's duty to treat all patients who have AIDS can be realized in a safe and supportive environment.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormal joint mobility is an important factor in movement dysfunction and physical disability. Because the decision to treat impaired joint mobility in an older individual may be influenced by assumptions concerning normal range of motion (ROM) at older ages, it is important to establish population-based normative values for hip and knee ROM by age, race, and sex. This study used data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1), which involved a national probability sample of persons drawn from the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States. Goniometric measurements of hip and knee active range of motion (AROM) were obtained from a subset of the sample consisting of 1,892 subjects. This analysis was limited to the 1,313 white and 370 black subjects. Univariate statistics, weighted by the probability of selection into the sample, were calculated for 12 sex-race-age-group-specific categories. These normal AROM values for the hip and knee calculated from this population based sample were found to differ from estimates found in textbooks by as much as 18 degrees. With one exception, normal values for all motions were lower in the oldest age group than in the youngest age group. The differences in mean AROM were generally small, ranging from 3 to 5 degrees. Only in the case of hip extension did the difference in mean AROM between the youngest and the oldest age groups constitute a decline of more than 20% of the arc of motion. With the possible exception of hip extension, this study supports the conclusion that, at least to age 74 years, any substantial loss of joint mobility should be viewed as abnormal and not attributable to aging and therefore should be treated much as it would be in a younger individual.\r"

Repeated eccentric contractions were used to induce DOMS in the elbow flexors of 40 college-aged women. Subjects were then assigned randomly to one of four groups: (1) group 1 (n = 10) received sham ultrasound using placebo cream, (2) group 2 (n = 10) received sham ultrasound using trolamine salicylate cream, (3) group 3 (n = 10) received ultrasound using placebo cream, and (4) group 4 (n = 10) received ultrasound using trolamine salicylate cream. Subjects were treated on 3 consecutive days. Muscle soreness and active elbow range of motion were assessed daily prior to each treatment. The subjects in group 3 experienced an increase in DOMS, whereas no increase in soreness was observed in the subjects in group 4. The authors concluded that ultrasound enhanced the development of DOMS but that this enhancement was offset by the anti-inflammatory-analgesic action of salicylate phonophoresis. These findings suggest that salicylate phonophoresis may be useful in clinical situations in which it is desirable to administer ultrasound without increasing inflammation.\r"

This study was carried out in two phases. In phase 1, four student essay papers (two physical therapy students' papers and two occupational therapy students' papers) with grades that had been assigned from the previous year's course were randomly selected from a bank of papers. These papers were independently rated by three course planners (who were responsible for planning, coordinating, and tutoring in the course), and agreement as to the assignment of grades for each paper was established. In phase 2, the same students' essays were rated independently by eight course tutors. To test for differences among students' written essay papers and for differences among the raters in the subcategories of discipline (physical therapy versus occupational therapy) and level of expertise (novice versus experienced) in grading essays, a three-way analysis of variance was performed. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for interrater reliability. Although there were no statistically significant differences among the tutors with regard to their discipline and expertise, the reliability analysis produced an ICC of .79. Strategies to enhance the reliability of grading essays are discussed.\r"

The components of such an examination are well documented, and include not only the standard history and physical examination, but also evaluation of mental health, functional status, and socioeconomic status of the person. A major impediment to a family physician doing such an extensive evaluation is that most offices lack the team approach commonly used in tertiary care medical facilities. In this paper I report the implementation of a computer-assisted program that was developed for use in a private physician's office. The first 22 patients examined using this protocol are discussed. A new diagnosis was uncovered in all but three of the subjects. This finding suggests that performing comprehensive geriatric assessments in a family practice setting might create an immediate benefit in terms of patient management.\r"

Of 78 patients in our series who had percutaneous IABP cardiac assist, 15 (19%) had complications, which falls into the acceptable range reported by others. Among 15 patients who had surgical placement of an IABP, the complication rate was similar at 20%. The complication rate after IABP insertions done by surgeons primarily in the operating room was compared with that from insertions done by cardiologists in the catheterization laboratory. The overall complication rate was found to be higher in the second group, 28.0% compared with 12.8%. The application of the IABP in cardiogenic shock was associated with a high complication rate (46%). On the other hand, its insertion before cardiac surgery was associated with a relatively low complication rate (9.5%).\r"

The coexistence of abdominal obesity and electrocardiographic abnormalities may facilitate the development of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. We determined the relationship of body fat distribution and obesity to ECG indices in 27 obese premenopausal women on an isocaloric diet. Intra-abdominal fat distribution was assessed by computerized tomography, and obesity was assessed by hydrostatic weighing. The PR, QRS, and QTc intervals, the P and QRS axes, and the P-QRS angle were determined from a resting electrocardiogram. Cardiovascular risk profile was assessed by systolic and diastolic blood pressure and plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Increased deposition of intra-abdominal fat was significantly associated with prolongation of the QTc interval independent of obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors. The prolongation of the QTc interval seen with increasing intra-abdominal fat distribution may enhance susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. These subjects should have electrocardiographic monitoring during periods of weight loss achieved by intensive regimens.\r"

Reversible arterial, venous, and arteriovenous occlusion was studied in rabbit intestines. After 6 to 8 hours of occlusion, intestinal vascularity was evaluated by the four methods listed. Doppler ultrasonography and surface oximetry were found to be unreliable tools for assessing perfusion in this animal model. We conclude that standard clinical criteria and fluorescein remain the standards for intraoperative evaluation of intestinal perfusion.\r"

Two major factors that frequently lead to a delay in appropriate treatment with subsequent limb loss are failure to appreciate the presence and severity of underlying infection and attribution of gangrene of the toe and forefoot to microvascular disease. To evaluate the consequences of delayed recognition and treatment, we reviewed the records of 55 diabetic patients with localized gangrene or infection of the forefoot in 62 limbs, treated consecutively on a single vascular surgical service over a 2-year period using a standard protocol. All appropriately treated neuropathic ulcers and forefoot infections healed in patients with palpable pedal pulses. If foot pulses were absent and arteriography confirmed large-vessel occlusive disease, foot lesions and infections likewise healed if concomitant revascularization was done. In our series, 33 bypasses were required because of severe atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Only one patient had \"unreconstructable\" arterial disease. Limb salvage was 86% at a mean follow-up of 12.4 months. In 16 of the patients (29%), there was a prolonged delay between initial treatment and referral for definitive care. The specific causes of delay were underestimation of the severity of foot infection in 10 patients, and lack of recognition of ischemia due to large-vessel occlusive disease in six. These delays led to more proximal levels of amputation in six patients, including three below-knee amputations in patients with limbs that were initially salvageable.\r"

Of approximately 500 allograft procedures done at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1979 to 1988, 11 were done for restoration of traumatic bone loss. The average age of the patients was 30 (range 11 to 71 years), and the location of the defect was the tibia or femur in 10 of the 11 patients studied. Eight osteoarticular grafts (six hemicondylar and two total condylar) and three intercalary grafts were used for six open and five closed fractures. The time from injury to reconstruction averaged 17 months (3 to 96 months). Primary reconstruction was done in three cases and a salvage procedure in eight. Patients were assessed by the operating surgeon and a physical therapist using an evaluation system that considers function, life-style, and emotional acceptance. According to the system, nine patients had excellent or good results (six hemicondylar grafts, three intercalary grafts), one patient had a fair result (total elbow graft), and one patient had failure of a total condylar graft and subsequently required an amputation. This study suggests that large bone allografts are of value in reconstructing traumatic skeletal defects, especially those involving an articular surface in a young patient.\r"

Most women are more likely to use antibiotics, analgesics, and antihistamines, which have also been shown to interact with OCs. The mechanisms behind these interactions may be hepatic microsomal enzyme induction or inhibition, interference with the enterohepatic circulation of steroid metabolites, interference with absorption, competition between two drugs for the same metabolizing enzyme, or induction of an opposite physiologic effect. Rifampin was the first drug reported to interfere with the efficacy of OCs. The anticonvulsants and certain antibiotics, namely ampicillin and tetracycline, also decrease the efficacy of OCs. Oral contraceptives also interfere with the metabolism of other drugs. Plasma concentrations of theophylline, diazepam, and certain other benzodiazepines are increased by OC steroids. Because OCs interact with a wide variety of prescription and over-the-counter medications, a thorough drug history should be taken in all patients taking OCs.\r"

One category of absorbable materials consists of donor tissue, either autogenous (fascia lata, plantaris gracilis tendon) or from cadavers (dura mater, sclera, fascia lata). A second category includes gelatin, reconstituted collagen, absorbable gut, fibrin, blood plasma, air, and sodium hyaluronate; of these, specially prepared gelatin seems to be the most useful. Nonabsorbable implant materials have proven more practical than absorbable implants. Solid silicone rubber is currently the most popular scleral implant material. It is soft, easy to handle, and well tolerated. Expandable implants, either temporary or permanent, are used in the form of a silicone balloon filled with liquid. Silicone sponge, also widely used, has the advantage of great softness. However, hydrogels seem to be the ideal scleral implants. The only one commercially available is Refojo's MAI implant. It is very soft and is not damaged by sutures, has a smooth surface, is molded in several sizes and shapes, and has small pores that microorganisms cannot penetrate. When saturated with a water-soluble antibiotic before implantation, this implant releases the antibiotic postoperatively for a longer time than any other implant material. Finally, surgical adhesives are useful when the sclera is too thin or weak to tolerate sutures. The best adhesive available seems to be isobutyl cyanoacrylate.\r"

  ".W": "Mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) supplies extranuclear (cytoplasmic) genes which program the manufacture of 13 of the 67 peptides of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes. The remaining 54 are coded by nuclear DNA. All human children and adults, male and female, are entirely dependent on the cytoplasm of the ovum for their complement of mt DNA; the sperm contributes none. Accordingly, mutations in the mt DNA in a mother's ova will be passed on to all her children, although not all are clinically affected. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is in most cases due to a mutation that leads to the replacement of guanine by adenine at position 11778 in mt DNA. This causes histidine to be inserted instead of the normal arginine at the site of the 340th amino acid in the respiratory enzyme NADH subunit 4, hence its defective function. Other point mutations in the mt DNA coding for polypeptides of the respiratory chain complex or controlling sequences coded by mt DNA have been found in other families with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial DNA is the site of other mutations as well. For ophthalmologists, the most important of these is the rare Kearns-Sayre syndrome (pigmentary retinopathy plus muscular dystrophies, especially of the extraocular muscles). Kearns-Sayre syndrome is due to deletions in the mt DNA, which vary in size and so affect a number of different respiratory enzymes, hence the variable manifestations. Cases are usually sporadic because the disease is often so severe that affected individuals do not reproduce if they survive, but in some cases inheritance from the mother has been reported.\r"

Of the total of 230 cases, 228 were included in the present study; the two remaining victims died abroad, and no autopsy was performed in Finland. Most of the hyperthermia deaths occurred while the decedent was taking a sauna bath; most decedents were men aged 42-62 years. An increase in the total number of hyperthermia deaths, and of male victims, was noted from the beginning of the 1970s onward; the number of female victims remained at a relatively steady level throughout, with the exception of a slight rise in 1986. Acute alcohol consumption was detected in most of the victims; in some cases there was also a reference to chronic alcoholism or recent long-term heavy drinking. The findings suggest that in addition to the acute hazardous effect of ethanol on thermoregulatory mechanisms, the long-term consumption of alcohol may have promoted fatal hyperthermia in these subjects.\r"

This predominantly North American white population contained 560 males and 164 females with intact, nondeformed clavicles. Clavicle length and circumference and particularly their product have been found useful in sexing, but robustness as a single trait has not. Despite a significant overlap of male and female values, the use of single cutoff values allowed correct sex assignment of up to 93% of the entire study population, including 94% of males and 89% of females. The ratios of body length to clavicle circumference and to clavicle length are on average greater in women than in men. The former ratio yields male predictive values greater than 95% for those individuals with ratios falling below the cutoff value of 43, whereas the latter ratio is a relatively poor sex predictor.\r"

When the remains were found, there was no idea who the deceased might be. The initial forensic examination provided a general description (age, height, and sex), and reconstruction of the vertebral column showed extensive changes caused by arthrosis and changes typical for Scheurmann's disease. The description made on this basis was sent to police stations throughout the country and, far from where the remains were found, a police officer had received the report of a missing person who could have been the deceased. Further investigation was based mainly on the medical history of this missing person and the tracing of the effects found with the remains, and emphasized radiographic comparison.\r"

Blunt-force injuries are produced by a variety of objects, including hands and feet and many different weapons. Some of these objects produce distinctive patterns of injury of potential evidentiary value. This paper presents a series of 20 consecutive blunt-force homicides in adults. Seventy percent (14 cases) of the victims were men. Thirty percent (six cases) followed an argument or altercation. A number of the weapons used were \"weapons of opportunity\" seized in the course of the incidents. Sixty-nine percent (nine cases) of known assailants were acquainted with their victims. Few characteristic patterned injuries were seen. Not surprisingly, craniocerebral trauma was the most common cause of death. One half (10 cases) the victims survived their assaults for varying periods of time. Homicides due to blunt-force injury still pose a significant challenge for the forensic pathologist, who must obtain a complete and accurate history of the fatal incident, interpret patterns of injury and other findings at autopsy, and correlate all of the findings to make an accurate ruling of the cause and manner of death.\r"

Indications for esophageal biopsy were dysphagia persisting after antifungal therapy and/or radiologic evidence of esophageal ulcer. We compared the frequency of detecting cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain with immunoperoxidase staining for CMV antigens. Five biopsies were positive for CMV by H&E stain and immunoperoxidase. Infected cells could often be identified in the granulation tissue and, in one severe case, in stromal papillae of the intact mucosa. Squamous cells were never positive. Thirteen biopsies consisted only of squamous epithelium, and all of these were negative by both techniques. Among the remaining 10 cases, no CMV inclusions were identified by H&E. Three of these biopsies displayed staining for viral antigens. In all cases positive by immunoperoxidase, numerous cells positive for viral antigens did not display any of the CMV-specific morphologic diagnostic criteria. Other coexisting diagnoses included candidiasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and malignant lymphoma. We conclude 1) CMV infection of the esophagus is common in AIDS patients with esophageal ulcer or esophagitis resistant to antifungal therapy; 2) multiple infections or neoplasms may coexist; 3) since CMV apparently does not infect squamous epithelium and only rarely endothelium in stromal papillae, deep biopsies are necessary for diagnosis; and 4) immunoperoxidase staining is required for maximum diagnostic yield.\r"

  ".W": "Drug-induced esophagitis is being recognized increasingly in the past few years. We have reviewed 175 cases with a view to classifying this disease based on pathology. Drug-induced esophageal injury tends to occur at the anatomical site of narrowing, with the middle third behind the left atrium predominating. The disease is classified broadly into two groups. The first group is transient and self-limiting, as exemplified by tetracycline- and emepronium-induced injury (57.3%). The second is the persistent esophagitis group, often with stricture with two distinct entities: 1) patients on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents whose injury is aggravated by gastroesophageal reflux (26.2%) (reflux aggravated), and 2) patients with potassium chloride and quinidine sulfate-induced injury (16.2%) (persisting drug injury). We report a case that highlights the pathophysiology (delayed transit, persisting potassium within the stricture) of this type of injury which is not reflux aggravated.\r"

  ".W": "Duplicate measurements of basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure using a triple-lumen catheter and the rapid pull-through technique (RPT) were performed in 250 consecutive patients to determine their reproducibility for categorizing LES pressures as normal, hypertensive, or hypotensive. For all subjects, mean LES pressure did not differ for the two measurements (25.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 26.2 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, p greater than 0.5), but the correlation coefficient was only modest (r = 0.73). Reproducibility of categorization was 92% (230 of 250 subjects), and was best for subjects with normal (170/179, 95%) or hypotensive (24/26, 92%) values (for hypertensives: 36/45, 80%). Interstudy variability was least for the hypotensive group (1.8 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and greatest for the hypertensive group (16.4 +/- 1.9 mm Hg). Likewise, the range of individual values from the triple-lumen catheter was least for the hypotensive subjects (4.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg) and greatest for those with hypertensive LES pressure (32.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg). These data show that, despite its interstudy variability, the RPT reproducibly categorizes basal LES pressure in greater than 90% of cases. The technique appears least reliable in determining hypertensive LES pressure, where diaphragmatic contraction may most significantly contribute to measurement variability.\r"

  ".U": "91353502\r", 
  ".W": "Two questions were examined, namely, 1) whether pH 4 is really the optimal threshold for the definition of acid gastroesophageal reflux, and 2) to what extent shifting of the upper limits of normal affects sensitivity and specificity of 24-h pH monitoring. To answer these questions, we studied 74 patients with proven reflux disease and 37 asymptomatic volunteers, using ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring. Gastroesophageal reflux was defined as episodes with esophageal pH of less than the threshold values 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0, respectively. For each of these pH thresholds, the percentage time with esophageal pH below the threshold was calculated separately for periods of upright and supine body position. Two-dimensional receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to define upper limits of normal. A maximum of sensitivity, specificity, and rate of correct decisions (all 89%) was obtained using pH 4 for the definition of gastroesophageal reflux, although other pH thresholds were not much worse. On the basis of pH 4, the upper limits of normal could be shifted around the \"optimal upper limit of normal\" within a certain limit without considerable loss of accuracy of pH monitoring. This may explain the divergences between upper limits of normal obtained by different laboratories. In conclusion, 1) the threshold pH 4 should further be used for the definition of acid gastroesophageal reflux, and, 2) within certain limits, shifting of the upper limits of normal has little effect on the accuracy of pH monitoring in gastroesophageal reflux disease.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged esophageal pH monitoring is considered to be the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the role of pH monitoring in predicting the clinical and endoscopic response of reflux esophagitis is not well defined. In this study, 106 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of GERD and esophagitis (grades 0-IV) by endoscopy were initially studied by ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring, and their clinical response to standard H2 antagonist therapy was monitored at 8 wk. Refractory patients were defined as those who failed to heal and/or had intractable reflux symptoms after 8 wk of H2 antagonist therapy, and who required continuous therapy with higher doses of H2 antagonists, addition of prokinetic agents, or omeprazole. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.89) between endoscopic severity of esophagitis upon entry into the study and refractoriness to standard medical therapy. However, there were no differences in the various pH parameters analyzed between the 58 patients who responded and the 48 patients who were refractory to medical therapy, regardless of the endoscopic grading of their esophagitis. We conclude that 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring does not predict refractoriness of reflux esophagitis to standard therapy. The decision for more aggressive methods of treatment probably requires assessment of symptomatic and endoscopic response after 8 week standard H2 antagonist therapy.\r"

No difference in the basal acid output, concentration, or volume of secretion was found between the two study days.

The reduction in maximum acid output was attributable to a fall in the volume of gastric secretion from 280 (170-371) ml to 230 (142-280) ml. No fall in acid concentration was seen. We conclude that overnight gastric aspiration does not affect basal gastric secretion, but reduces the maximum acid output as a result of a reduced secretory volume.\r"

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and somatostatin released in the culture medium were determined by radioimmunoassay. Under basal conditions, EGF and somatostatin levels were significantly higher in normal subjects (11.49 +/- 3.07 ng/mg protein and 3.06 +/- 0.8 ng/mg protein, respectively) than in ulcerous patients (6.9 +/- 1.98 ng/mg protein and 1.75 +/- 1.23 ng/mg protein, respectively). However, when antibodies to somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were added together to the culture media, in ulcerous patients, EGF levels also were lower as absolute values, but were higher as a percentage of variation than controls (p less than 0.05). The fall of EGF secretion from tissue cultures of ulcerous patients could be the consequence of endocrine cellular loss or damage, rather than the cause of ulceration. Moreover, the EGF-producing cells around the lesion in ulcerous patients seems to be hyperactive, and this hyperfunction of EGF-producing cells might contribute to the in vivo repair of tissue damage.\r"

A smaller proportion of DU patients have no detectable HP. In this study, we examined the frequency and causes of HP-negative duodenal ulcers. In 302 consecutive patients with endoscopic diagnosis of duodenal ulcer, 284 (94%) were found to have associated HP gastritis, whereas 18 (6%) were HP-negative on histology, culture, and urease test. The largest subgroup of HP-negative patients (8/18) was made up of those who had been taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed closely (4/18) by patients with recent intake of antibiotics. Causes of DU in the remaining subgroups included two patients with duodenal Crohn's disease, two with Gastrospirillum hominis infection, one with penetrating carcinoma of the pancreas and one with no detectable cause. We conclude that, although the most common causal factor of duodenal ulcer is HP, some 6% of DU's will be HP-negative, signaling unusual etiology. It is now important to identify the cause of duodenal ulcer so as to initiate appropriate therapy.\r"

There is a need both for improved therapies and for ways to rapidly identify therapies that show sufficient promise to be worth pursuing. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the value of a therapeutic regimen of a bismuth salt plus nitrofurantoin for eradication of infection by H. pylori and to determine the validity/utility of the urea breath test in monitoring the progress of a clinical trial. We used an 80% eradication rule to define a promising therapeutic regimen, i.e., a regimen that eradicated the infection (no evidence of infection by H. pylori 4 wk after termination of therapy) in at least 80% of the individuals treated. Eighteen men (median age 38) with documented infection by H. pylori completed the study. At the end-of-study evaluation, H. pylori infection was eradicated (negative urea breath test, culture, and histology) in only one of 18 (5.5%) subjects; 15 were positive by the urea breath test, 16 by culture, 15 by Warthin-Starry stain, and 16 by the presence of acute-on-chronic inflammation. Using the 80% eradication rule, any one of these tests alone would have identified that the combination of antimicrobials tested was not effective in the eradication of the infection. We conclude that the urea breath test is a simple, noninvasive, cost-effective method to separate promising from unpromising candidate therapies and for the evaluation of new therapeutic concepts.\r"

Thirty-three cases (58%) of group I showed a stromal type, whereas only 17 cases (30%) of group II showed the same type. In undifferentiated type carcinoma, the stromal type was seen in 20 cases (65%) of group I and seven cases (23%) of group II. However, in differentiated type carcinoma, there was only a small difference in the appearance of stromal type between group I (50%) and group II (37%). The immunohistochemical localization for CA19-9 in the tumor tissues, particularly in undifferentiated carcinoma, will be useful in predicting the prognosis of the patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.\r"

Argyrophil cells were seen in eight tumors. Immunohistochemically positive cells for chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, and keratin were seen in 12, 10, and 7 tumors, respectively. Carcinoembryonic antigen was negative in the small cell component of most tumors as opposed to strong positivity in the glandular component. Electron-dense core granules were evident in seven of nine tumors examined. These findings suggest that histologic variety is quite characteristic of the small cell carcinomas of the stomach, and this type of carcinoma takes an aggressive clinical course like its counterparts in other organs.\r"

Thirty-nine patients (35%) had a history of prior abdominal surgery. Fourteen underwent laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Intraoperative cholangiograms were performed in 24 patients (21%), demonstrating choledocholithiasis in three. Two of the three patients underwent postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); in the other, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration was performed. In each case, the common bile duct (CBD) was completely cleared of stones. Incidental laparoscopic appendectomy was also performed in three patients. The average time for completion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in cases of chronic cholecystitis was 40 min. If the gallbladder was acutely inflamed, the procedure took a mean of 126 min. This series had a higher percentage of patients (19%) with acute cholecystitis then previously reported; therefore, the 2% conversion rate in this series emphasizes the broad applicability of the technique. The average length of stay in the hospital was 1.4 days, and patients returned to work in about 7 days.\r"

Therefore, in our patients, duodenal ulcer occurs more often in PBC than in other types of chronic liver disease.

In this study, we examined immunohistochemically hepatocellular expression of HLA antigens on hepatocytes before and after UDCA therapy in four patients with asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis. Piecemeal necrosis, intralobular focal necrosis, and portal inflammation, as well as infiltration of activated T-lymphocytes and expression of HLA class I antigens on hepatocytes, disappeared, or diminished in parallel after the therapy. In two of four patients, expression of HLA-DR on some periportal hepatocytes before the therapy also disappeared after the therapy. These observations imply that UDCA therapy decreases the hepatocellular expression of HLA antigens and thereby reduces or abolishes T-cell-mediated hepatocellular necrosis in primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-seven patients with clinically suspected alcoholic liver disease were retrospectively studied for the prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assay. Twenty-four had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. Nineteen had identifiable risk factors for non-A, non-B viral hepatitis, and 18 did not. Five of 19 high-risk (26%) and 6 of 18 low-risk (33%) patients had positive antibody, compared with two of 179 healthy blood donors (p less than 0.01 for either group of alcoholics compared with blood donors). Nine of 11 ELISA-positive patients were also either positive or indeterminable by immunoblot testing. Histologic scores for parameters commonly associated with chronic viral hepatitis were numerically worse among anti-HCV-positive patients, but none reached statistical significance. Clinically, seven of 11 (64%) of anti-HCV-positive patients versus 14 of 26 (54%) anti-HCV-negative patients were Child's class C. Among the 21 Child's class C patients, seven (33%) were anti-HCV-positive versus four of 16 (25%) of Child's class A/B patients. A weak correlation between IgG and ELISA optical density was observed (r = 0.52). We conclude that antibody to hepatitis C by ELISA and immunoblot is common among alcoholics with liver disease even in the absence of known or suspected risk factors for viral hepatitis. Although hepatitis C-positive patients tended to have more severe histologic disease, neither histologic parameters nor clinical findings were adequate to predict antibody seropositivity.\r"

Initial sera were positive for HDV RNA in 27 of 48 (56%) patients. In comparison, isolated IgM anti-HD was present in 18 (38%) patients, although IgM and IgG anti-HD were present concurrently in 16 (33%) additional patients. Overall, either HDV RNA or IgM anti-HD was present in 69% of the initial sera. The HDV infection was self-limiting in all except two patients who died of fulminant hepatitis and nine others in whom chronic delta hepatitis ensued. Patterns of HDV seropositivity during progression to chronicity induced variable persistence, disappearance or recrudescence of either HDV RNA or IgM and IgG anti-HD. Results of HDV RNA and IgM anti-HD tests were concordant in only 40-50% of instances. Our results indicate that serological testing for HDV RNA is direct and will demonstrate HDV replication in a large number of cases with acute delta hepatitis. Testing for IgM anti-HD could provide supplemental evidence for HDV infection. Sequential testing for these markers will facilitate assessment of the outcome of acute HDV infection.\r"

A 55-yr-old female experienced long-term liver damage showing histological triaditis with atypical lymphoid cell infiltration and erythrophagocytosis. The patient developed marked hepatosplenomegaly and eventually died of respiratory failure. Neither systemic lymphadenopathy nor hematological disorder was noted until her death. Autopsy revealed small atypical lymphoid cells positive for T-cell marker, as well as extensive infiltration of generalized organs, including the liver, spleen, and lungs. As a result of diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cell admixed with variable reactive cells, mainly at the T-zone, the lymph nodes underwent effacement of normal architecture; however, the peripheral sinuses and the fibrous capsule remained relatively well preserved. These histological features were consistent with a diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL). It is interesting to note that there were numerous epithelioid granulomas admixed with a small number of atypical lymphoid cells within the hepatic parenchyma. The atypical lymphoid cells may be responsible for the granulomatous reaction in the liver. To our knowledge, there have been no other reported cases of PTL that presented with numerous epithelioid granulomas confined to the liver.\r"

In the second patient, no anatomical explanation was found for cholangitis attacks. However, although the duodenal motor activity was normal, the motility of the limb and of the jejunum below the jejunojejunal anastomosis was grossly abnormal: permanent minute rhythm, phase IIIs absent or rare and slowly propagated, all motor abnormalities that could promote bacterial overgrowth in the limb. This stresses the interest in performing motor studies of the Roux-limb when cholangitis remains unexplained after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.\r"

The narrow segments of the ducts were patent and connected with the main pancreatic duct extraduodenally, whereas the CBD in controls were neither dilated nor stenotic, and joined the main pancreatic duct within the duodenal wall. These narrow segments were 1 cm long. In case 1, a minute orifice was found in the narrow segment of the duct macroscopically and was identified microscopically as a small duct from a pancreatic lobule. In case 2, a small pancreatic duct also joined the narrow segment of the duct. These small pancreatic ducts were derived from the ventral pancreas, based on distribution of PP-islets. Therefore, the narrow duct distal to the cyst in patients with CholCyst (or congenital biliary dilatation) was considered to be a branch of the ventral pancreatic duct.\r"

  ".U": "91353543\r", 
  ".W": "High blood pressure (BP) complicates approximately 10% of all pregnancies. Hypertension in pregnancy falls into four categories: (1) preeclampsia-eclampsia, (2) chronic hypertension of whatever cause, (3) preeclampsia-eclampsia superimposed to chronic hypertension or renal disease, and (4) transient or late hypertension (gestational hypertension). Preeclampsia, the association of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema, accounts for more than 50% of all the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is a major cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, distinguishing between preeclampsia and other causes of hypertension on clinical grounds can be difficult because of the lack of specific tests for differential diagnosis. Increased vascular resistance has been claimed as the primary cause of preeclampsia; however, a variable hemodynamic profile with relatively high cardiac outputs, normal filling pressures, and inappropriately high systemic vascular resistances is now reported by most investigators. Imbalance between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor eicosanoids may account for platelet activation and increased responsiveness to pressor peptides. Altered prostacyclin (PGI2) to thromboxane A2 (TxA2) ratio in maternal uteroplacental vascular bed may favor local platelet activation and vasoconstriction contributing to placental insufficiency and fetal distress. Alternatively, recent evidence seems to suggest that fetal umbilical placental circulation may be the site of the primary vascular injury. Whether low-dose aspirin prevents preeclampsia because it inhibits the excessive maternal TxA2 or whether the partial inhibition of fetal TxA2 is also of therapeutic value remains to be established. Treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is probably important to prevent cardiac failure or cerebrovascular accidents in the mother. The need for pharmacological therapy of mild to moderate hypertension is still debated, since no formal studies are available to clarify whether pharmacological treatment in such instances effectively reduces maternal or fetal risk. For the treatment of preeclampsia, hydralazine and nifedipine may be used when delivery is not applicable. Labetalol and diazoxide are effective for hypertensive emergencies. Life-threatening hypertension that does not respond to more conventional therapy is an indication for the use of sodium nitroprusside. For chronic hypertension, alpha-methyldopa remains the treatment of choice; if ineffective, hydralazine or beta-blockers are suitable. Effectiveness and safety of other molecules remain elusive.\r"

Initial diagnoses, based on examination of the paraffin sections, varied, membrano-proliferative, mesangial, and membranous glomerulonephritis being most frequently considered. However, electron microscopic examination showed that 77 children had a uniform type of glomerulopathy, irrespective of the light microscopic appearance. This type was diagnosed as secondary membranous glomerulonephritis. The clinical course of this nephropathy was relatively indolent and short. Moreover, in many children, elimination of some hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens from the circulation was also associated with clinical remission of glomerulopathy. The remaining 21 children with HBs antigenemia had various morphological forms of glomerulonephritis, these being similar to their idiopathic counterparts in both morphology and clinical course. The distinct clinical and morphological picture of secondary membranous glomerulonephritis with HBs antigenemia occurring in 77 of 98 children supports the hypothesis that HBsV-associated glomerulonephritis is of the secondary membranous type. Thus, we conclude that in children HBV antigenemia associated with glomerulonephritis other than secondary membranous is coincidental.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular form of the pathognomonic IgA in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) remains controversial. Because characterization of the molecular form of IgA molecules can lend insight into their origin (systemic v mucosal), we developed immunoassays to measure both total and J chain-containing (polymeric) IgA1 and IgA2. These assays were used to measure IgA in sera from two groups of IgAN patients (with normal or decreased renal function), as well as from a group of normal individuals. IgA1 levels were higher in both groups of patients with IgAN when compared with the controls. The elevation appeared to be restricted to non-J chain-containing (monomeric) IgA1 in patients with normal renal function, whereas polymeric IgA1 was also slightly elevated in patients whose renal function was diminished. While there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the levels of total IgA2, the patient group with normal kidney function appeared to have lower levels of polymeric IgA2. The observation that the elevation in serum IgA appears to be restricted to the monomeric form of IgA1, at least when renal function is normal, implies a systemic origin of the pathognomonic IgA in IgAN and further suggests an abnormality in the regulation of IgA secretion by immunoglobulin-producing cells in bone marrow, the site of systemic IgA synthesis.\r"

Previous investigations of cardiac function before and after parathyroidectomy have failed to control for ionized calcium, other biochemical parameters, or heart rate and cardiovascular loading conditions. We performed load- and rate-independent measurements of myocardial contractility in seven stable hemodialysis patients before and after surgical parathyroidectomy under identical conditions of blood ionized calcium (Ca2+), electrolytes, pH, PO2, and hematocrit. Mid-molecule PTH decreased from 44 +/- 8 to 2 +/- 1 ng/mL. Aortic systolic and diastolic pressures, left ventricular chamber dimensions, end systolic wall stress, left ventricular contractility at a common level of afterload, and contractile reserve evaluated with dobutamine were similar before and after parathyroidectomy. Thus, PTH appears not to have a direct effect on myocardial contractile state in dialysis patients.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to identify the causes of death in maintenance dialysis patients who survived at least 90 days and were monitored during a 16-year period. Of 532 patients starting dialysis, 222 died. The causes of death were grouped into six categories: cardiac, infectious, withdrawal from dialysis, sudden, vascular, and \"other.\" The greatest number of deaths were due to infections, followed by withdrawal from dialysis, cardiac, sudden death, vascular, and other. The risk of dying increased for the first 4 years of dialysis, decreased in years 5 through 10, and had a second increase at 11 years. The mortality during the first 4 years consisted largely of infectious and cardiac deaths. The late peak of deaths was mainly due to infections and withdrawal from dialysis. Overall, infections accounted for more than 36% of all deaths. Withdrawal occurred in 21.2% of the patients and was most common in patients over age 61. Notably, cardiac deaths accounted for only 14.4% of all deaths and no patient died from a cardiac cause after surviving on dialysis more than 8.5 years. We conclude that infection is the leading cause of death in our dialysis patient population. Withdrawal from dialysis was a common cause of death, especially in older patients. Cardiac mortality was not as frequent as anticipated and occurred mainly in patients on dialysis less than 4 years, suggesting that it is the result of preexisting disease.\r"

H-ESRD increased from 6.4 to 9.6 per 100,000 in blacks and from 0.36 to 0.62 per 100,000 in whites. Smoothed age- and race-specific yearly H-ESRD rates decreased in blacks under age 50. Peak incidence of H-ESRD shifted from age 40 to 49 in 1974 through 1978 to age 50 to 59 in 1982 through 1987 (P less than 0.0001). Blacks were referred for care with significantly higher blood pressure levels and serum creatinine concentrations than whites, and had more severe retinal vascular disease. Factors significantly associated with a shorter time from referral to renal replacement therapy were black race, female gender, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations, carbohydrate intolerance, and the use of alpha-agonist and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. We conclude that racial distribution and risk for H-ESRD have not changed. Peak rates of H-ESRD have been delayed nearly a decade, suggesting a possible effect of better awareness and treatment of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Little data are available about risk factors for peritoneal catheter subcutaneous tunnel infection. Therefore, we analyzed tunnel infections occurring in our program over a 10.5-year period. One hundred twenty-nine tunnel infections occurred in 92 of 411 patients (22%) on peritoneal dialysis for a mean of 19 +/- 19 months. Tunnel infection rate was 0.19 per year. By 1 year, 15% of patients had a tunnel infection, and by 2 years, 23%. Tunnel infection rates decreased with increasing time on peritoneal dialysis: 2.4 per year for patients on peritoneal dialysis less than 1 year, 0.8 per year for patients on dialysis 1 to 2 years, and 0.4 per year for patients on dialysis greater than 2 years (all different at P less than 0.01). Organisms were cultured in 109 tunnel infections: gram-positive cocci in 77 episodes (71%) [Staphylococcus aureus 57, 52%], and gram-negative bacilli in 24 episodes (22%). Tunnel infection rates were higher in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.27 per year v 0.16 per year, respectively; P less than 0.001 by life-table analysis of time to first infection) and also higher in women than in men (0.23 per year v 0.17 per year, P less than 0.001). Tunnel infection rates were 0.35 per year for diabetic women, 0.20 per year for diabetic men, 0.18 per year for nondiabetic women, and 0.15 per year for nondiabetic men (groups different, P less than 0.001). Race and age were similar in patients with and without tunnel infections. Catheter loss was 80% when tunnel infection was associated with peritonitis and 40% when tunnel infection alone was present (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the risk of tunnel infection is highest early in the course of peritoneal dialysis and that diabetic women, for unclear reasons, are at the highest risk.\r"

Although statistically not significant, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications were more common in the study group. Gastroenteropathy with malnutrition was more common the study group (P less than 0.025). Infection rate and severity were markedly worse in the cocaine group: bacterial cellulitis, sepsis, and abscess each increased greater than fourfold. All the visceral infections were in the cocaine-using group. Hepatitis viral antigen and antibody was increased 10-fold in the cocaine users. Recommendations for management of dialysis patients with analgesic-seeking behavior are formulated in light of these findings.\r"

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that prednisone therapy, CsA therapy, patient age, and pretransplant cholesterol levels correlated independently with posttransplant cholesterol levels at last follow-up (ranging from 13 to 84 months after transplantation). In 32 patients successfully withdrawn from corticosteroid therapy and maintained on AZA and stable doses of CsA, serum cholesterol decreased from 6.55 +/- 1.1 mmol/L (253.5 +/- 43.1 mg/dL) to 5.27 +/- 1.2 mmol/L (203.9 +/- 45.6 mg/dL). Results of this analysis indicate that prednisone and CsA are independent factors in the pathogenesis of posttransplant hypercholesterolemia. Complete withdrawal of corticosteroids partially corrects hypercholesterolemia in CsA-treated renal transplant recipients.\r"

Receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3 were characterized by (1) sucrose density gradient analysis, (2) Scatchard analysis, and (3) DNA affinity of the receptor molecule. Specific binding occurred by a single class of macromolecules, sedimenting with 3.5 S in sucrose density gradients (5% to 20%). Receptors showed high affinity (Kd, 1.39 x 10(-10)), and specific binding capacity (Nmax) of 821 binding sites per cell. 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-6) to 10(-10)) reduced both DNA synthesis (by [3H]thymidine incorporation) and cell growth (by cell counting) throughout the log-phase and confluence. Further evidence of functional effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on hMC is provided by ultrastructural studies, which showed rapid increase of electron-dense lysosomal particles in hMC exposed to 1,25(OH)2D3. The data identify actions of 1,25(OH)2D3, a molecule with recently recognized immunoregulatory roles, on hMC. The results are consistent with a role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in control of mesangial cell function.\r"

Protein restriction reduced the severity of uremia, with lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations (8.9 +/- 1.1 v 30.0 +/- 2.9 mmol/L [25 +/- 3 v 84 +/- 8 mg/dL] both n = 12, P less than 0.01), and resulted in lower mortality at 2 weeks (0% v 33%, P less than 0.05), 4 weeks (16% v 58%, P less than 0.05), and 10 weeks (16 v 83%, P less than 0.01). Isolated perfusion of the remnant kidney at 3 weeks demonstrated reduced O2 consumption (QO2) (0.77 +/- 0.2 v 2.56 +/- 0.5 mumol/min/g, both n = 7, P less than 0.05) in the absence of significant differences in inulin clearance (239 +/- 53 v 341 +/- 39 microL/min/g, NS) and net sodium reabsorption (34 +/- 8 v 49 +/- 6 mumol/min/g, NS) in rats fed the LP diet. A lower renal QO2 in protein-restricted animals was also demonstrated in vivo (4.1 +/- 0.9 v 13.8 +/- 2.7 mumol/min/g, P less than 0.01). In vivo P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of remnant kidneys did not demonstrate any difference in the steady-state tissue concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or inorganic phosphate between rats fed LP and HP diets. Dietary protein restriction decreases the severity of uremia and diminishes renal QO2 in the remnant kidney model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies on trends in the causes of renal failure have benefited from Medicare's extensive data files on ESRD patients. However, no studies have been published that validate the cause of renal failure field in the Medicare files. The primary disease causing renal failure for over 10,000 New York State patients in the Medicare ESRD program was compared with their hospital discharge diagnoses. Of these patients, 8,730 (83%) had a known cause of renal failure in the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) data files. Eighty-nine percent of these patients' primary cause of renal failure was matched with the same major hospital diagnostic code. Patients with diabetes and glomerulonephritis had the highest overall match rates (96% to 97%). Patients with polycystic kidney disease and causes of renal failure other than the four major causes had the lowest match rates (75% to 76%), but these match rates increased to 84% to 87% for patients hospitalized more than five times. Some differences in match rate by age and race were found. These findings suggest that HCFA data on the causes of renal failure of ESRD patients are reasonably accurate and can be used successfully to study a variety of issues related to the diseases leading to chronic renal failure.\r"

We wondered whether nephrology fellowship training and/or formal exposure to an ethics course during training altered physicians' use of CPR. Significantly more nephrologists than internists responded to the study (nephrologists, 174/467; internists, 92/380; P less than 0.01). Few of the respondents participated in an ethics course during training (9% of nephrologists, 15% of internists; P = NS), and fewer than half (26% of nephrologists, 37% of internists; P = NS) had engaged in formal discussions about initiating and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment during their training. Nephrologists spent significantly more time caring for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) (29% v 21% of time, P less than 0.05), and more often discussed CPR during their first meeting with a patient (7% of nephrologists v 1% of internists; P less than 0.05). Twenty-eight percent of nephrologists and 19% of internists thought CPR should be offered to all patients. Both nephrologists and internists rated neurologic dysfunction as the most important and age the least important factor influencing decisions to terminate CPR. Nephrologists were less comfortable than internists with healthy dialysis patients' decisions to refuse CPR. We conclude that nephrologists are more inclined than internists to use CPR in dialysis patients, in patients with impaired functional status, and in all patients. Training in medical ethics did not account for the differences among nephrologists and internists.\r"

In recent years, the population of renal physicians has grown at a much faster rate than the rest of the physician population. A projection analysis indicates that the adult nephrologist population will more than double in size between 1987 and 2010. Among adult nephrologists, the number of women is expected to grow much faster than the number of men. Rapid growth is expected in the older age categories, whereas the number of adult nephrologists 35 years of age and younger is expected to decrease slightly.\r"

Her 3-year-old daughter was also affected by microhematuria of probable glomerular origin. The diagnosis of IgAGN was made by means of immunofluorescence investigation, which showed generalized diffuse mesangial deposits. TGBMD was identified by electron microscopic investigations, which disclosed thinning (up to 160 nm) of basement membrane of several capillary loops and prominence of the lamina densa. Bearing in mind the known frequencies of the two glomerulopathies, their association may not be coincidental, and, therefore, is worthwhile researching in hematuric patients.\r"

  ".W": "Familial amyloidosis of Finnish type (FAF) is one of the familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) syndromes, a group of inherited disorders characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid and by clinical symptoms and signs of polyneuropathy. FAF, an autosomal dominant trait, belongs to those rare monogenic disorders which occur with increased frequency in the Finnish population: only single FAF cases have been reported from other populations. In most types of FAP syndromes the accumulating protein is a transthyretin variant. However, recent evidence has suggested that the amyloid peptides in FAF are related to gelsolin, an actin modulating protein. The gelsolin fragments isolated from at least one patient with amyloidosis have been reported to have an amino acid substitution, with asparagine replacing aspartic acid at position 187 of the plasma gelsolin. In this study allele-specific oligonucleotides were used to analyze three large FAF families with multiple affected individuals as well as healthy family members. We found the corresponding G-A mutation in nucleotide 654 of the plasma gelsolin gene to cosegregate with the disease. The result was confirmed by sequencing and strongly suggests that the mutation has caused all the FAF cases of these families. Since the disease is clustered in restricted areas on the southern coast of Finland, this mutation most probably causes the majority, if not all, of FAF cases in Finland.\r"

In seven nonmosaic cases the DNA markers showed crossing-over between two maternal chromosomes 21, and in one mosaic case no crossing-over was observed (this case was probably due to an early postzygotic nondisjunction). In the majority of cases (five of six informative families) the proximal marker D21S120 was reduced to homozygosity in the offspring with trisomy 21. The data can be best explained by chromatid translocation in meiosis I and by normal crossover and segregation in meiosis I and meiosis II.\r"

The polymorphisms, 5' to 3', were BamHI, XmnI, TaqI, MnlI, and HhaI. A PCR procedure was developed for three previously described RFLPs-XmnI, TaqI, and MnlI; a PCRP procedure was developed for BamHI, and a PCRP which had been described by others was used for HhaI. Europeans were the most polymorphic, African-Americans and East Africans were intermediate, and Orientals were the least polymorphic. Extragenic 3' HhaI was highly polymorphic in most groups, and extragenic 5' BamHI was polymorphic only in persons with African ancestry. Two major haplotypes predominated among 247 men, and the expected and observed heterozygosities were concordant among women. Allelic association was very strong between the three intragenic PCRPs; it was present but weak between 5' extragenic BamHI and XmnI. No association was found between 3' extragenic HhaI and MnlI.\r"

Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding 218 residues of the NC1 domain of the human alpha 3(IV) chain. Of interest is the possible role of abnormalities of the alpha 3(IV) chain in Alport syndrome, as suggested by the failure to detect the NC1 domain of alpha 3(IV) in the basement membranes of some Alport syndrome patients. To determine whether the alpha 3(IV) gene (COL4A3) may be mutated in Alport syndrome, we localized it, by somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization of metaphase chromosomes, to chromosome 2q35-2q37. Mutations in alpha 3(IV) cannot therefore be responsible for the vast majority of cases of Alport syndrome, which have been shown to be X linked. One explanation for the immunochemical data implicating alpha 3(IV) in Alport syndrome pathogenesis is that mutations of the alpha 5(IV) chain, which has been localized to Xq22 and found to be mutated in at least three kindreds with Alport syndrome, lead to failure to incorporate the alpha 3(IV) chains into the multimeric structure of glomerular basement membrane in a stable fashion.\r"

The 440 bp 5' to the CAP site of CR-1 are preserved in CR-3. CR-1 maps to chromosome 3, and CR-3 maps to Xq21-q22.

  ".W": "In our previous study of eight glutaric acidemia type II (GAII) fibroblast lines by using [35S]methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation, three of them had a defect in the synthesis of the alpha-subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (alpha-ETF) (Ikeda et al. 1986). In one of them (YH1313) the labeling of the mature alpha-ETF was barely detectable, while that of the precursor (p) was stronger. In another (YH605) no synthesis of immunoreactive p alpha-ETF was detectable. In the third cell line (YH1391) the rate of variant p alpha-ETF synthesis was comparable to normal, but its electrophoretic mobility was slightly faster than normal. In the present study, the northern blot analysis revealed that all three mutant cell lines contained p alpha-ETF mRNA and that their size and amount were comparable to normal. In immunoblot analysis, both alpha- and beta-ETF bands were barely detectable in YH1313 and YH605 but were detectable in YH1391 in amounts comparable to normal. Sequencing of YH1313 p alpha-ETF cDNA via PCR identified a transversion of T-470 to G. We then devised a simple PCR method for the 119-bp section (T-443/G-561) for detecting this mutation. In the upstream primer, A-466 was artificially replaced with C, to introduce a BstNI site into the amplified copies in the presence of G-470 from the variant sequence. The genomic DNA analysis using this method demonstrated that YH1313 was homozygous for T----G-470 transversion. It was not detected either in two other alpha-ETF-deficient GAII or in seven control cell lines. The alpha-ETF cDNA sequence in YH605 was identical to normal.\r"

The cosmids were digested with several common cutting restriction endonucleases to liberate small fragments which were tested as unique-sequence chromosome 3-specific hybridization probes and for evolutionary sequence conservation. Unique-sequence hybridization probes isolated from the cosmids were hybridized to a somatic cell hybrid deletion mapping panel to subchromosomally localize the cosmids. Fragments from many of these cosmids demonstrated conservation of sequence through evolution, and these fragments hybridize to distinct transcripts. These cosmids should therefore prove a useful resource for the identification of many chromosome 3-specific genes, in addition to having potential use as linking clones for pulsed-field gel mapping studies.\r"

This mutation was also found in eight patients, from unrelated families, who had MELAS in a heteroplasmic manner but was not found in control individuals.

NF1 is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a single gene which maps to chromosome 17q11.2. The most common symptomatic manifestation of NF1 is the benign neurofibroma. Our previous studies of tumors in NF1, studies which detected a loss of heterozygosity for DNA markers from the NF1 region of chromosome 17 in malignant tumors, did not detect a loss in neurofibromas. We report here that a more extensive study, including the analysis of neurofibromas from 19 unrelated NF1 patients by using seven probes, failed to detect a single instance of loss of heterozygosity. This finding suggests that neurofibromas are either polyclonal or monoclonal in origin but arise by a mechanism different from that of NF1 malignancies. In order to investigate the first possibility, we analyzed neurofibromas from female NF1 patients by using an X chromosome-specific probe, from the phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) gene, which detects an RFLP. The detected alleles carry additional recognition sites for the methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII, so that the allele derived from the active X chromosome is digested by HpaII while the one from the hypermethylated, inactive X chromosome is not. We analyzed neurofibromas from 30 unrelated females with NF1. Eight patients were heterozygous for the PGK RFLP. By this assay, neurofibromas from all eight appeared monoclonal in origin. These results suggest that benign neurofibromas in NF1 arise by a mechanism that is different from that of malignant tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This value is significantly higher than the 75%-80% maternal nondisjunction rate typically observed in cytogenetic studies of trisomy 21 and illustrates the increased accuracy of the molecular approach. Using the maternally derived cases and probing at 19 polymorphic sites on chromosome 21, we created a genetic map that spans most of the long arm of chromosome 21. The map was significantly shorter than the normal female linkage map, indicating that absence of pairing and/or recombination contributes to nondisjunction in a substantial proportion of cases of trisomy 21.\r"

Amplification of this region by using PCR revealed seven alleles and a high degree of polymorphism (PIC = .75) in human populations. DNAs from the CEPH families were typed for the GABARB1 intron polymorphism and were analyzed with respect to 20 linked markers on chromosome 4. The results permit placement of GABARB1 on the linkage map of chromosome 4, between D4S104 and ALB.

We have isolated and partly characterized a YAC containing approximately 270 kb of human DNA from an X chromosome which expresses the fragile X. This sequence in a yeast artificial ring chromosome, XTY26, hybridizes to the two closest DNA markers, VK16 and Do33, which flank the fragile site. The human DNA sequence in XTY26 also spans the fragile site on chromosome in situ hybridization. When a restriction map of XTY26, derived by using infrequently cutting restriction enzymes, is compared with similar YAC maps derived from non-fragile-X patients, no large-scale differences are observed. This YAC, XTY26, may enable (a) the fragile site to be fully characterized at the molecular level and (b) the pathogenetic basis of the fragile-X syndrome to be determined.\r"

To analyze the possible heterogeneity behind Marfan syndrome, we have performed linkage analyses for four chromosome 15 markers in 17 families from five different populations: Scottish, English, Swiss, American, and Finnish. By combining the linkage data of all the studied families into a LINKMAP analysis we obtained a maximal LOD score of 11.2, which maps the Marfan syndrome locus between D15S25 and D15S45 on the long arm of chromosome 15. The data reveal no evidence for genetic heterogeneity behind Marfan syndrome and provide us with a more precise location of both the Marfan syndrome locus and flanking markers. This information will provide the basis for the DNA diagnostics of Marfan syndrome in the future.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin D-dependent rickets type II is a hereditary disease resulting from a defective vitamin D receptor. In three Japanese patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type II whose fibroblasts displayed normal cytosol binding and impaired nuclear uptake of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, western, Southern, and northern analyses failed to disclose any abnormalities in vitamin D3 receptor protein and its gene. Exons 2 and 3 of the vitamin D receptor cDNA, which encode the DNA-binding domain consisting of two zinc fingers, were amplified by PCR and sequenced to identify the specific mutations in the vitamin D receptor gene. In the three patients and one normal control a T-to-C transition was found in the putative initiation codon, while this transition was not observed in another normal control. This finding suggested that an original initiation codon was located at positions 10-12 in the human vitamin D receptor cDNA sequence reported previously. In contrast, a unique G-to-A transition at position 140 in exon 3, resulting in substitution of arginine by glutamine at residue 47, was revealed only in these three patients. The arginine at 47 is located between two zinc fingers and is conserved within all steroid hormone receptors. Therefore, it is highly conceivable that this amino acid substitution is responsible for the defect of the vitamin D receptor in the patients. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of amplified DNA confirmed that all patients were homozygous and that parents from one family were heterozygous carriers for this mutation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to examine the inheritance pattern of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). Complex segregation analysis using the unified model as in POINTER and the regressive model as in REGD programs were applied to analyze a midwestern U.S. Caucasian population of 79 families ascertained through a proband with CL/F. In REGD, the dominant or codominant Mendelian major locus models of inheritance were the most parsimonious fit. In POINTER, besides the Mendelian major locus model, the multifactorial threshold (MF/T) model and the mixed model were also consistent with the observed data. However, the high heritability parameter of .93 (SD .063) in the MF/T model suggests that any random exogenous factors are unlikely to be the underlying mechanisms, and the mixed model indicates that this high heritability is accounted for by a major dominant locus component. These findings indicate that the best explanation for the etiology of CL/P in this study population is a putative major locus associated with markedly decreased penetrance. Molecular studies may provide further insight into the genetic mechanism underlying CL/P.\r"

The small number of maintenance trials suggest that relapse of duodenal ulcer is reduced comparably to H2 receptor antagonists. There has been considerable interest in the possibility of lower relapse ratios after initial healing with sucralfate compared with H2 receptor antagonists, but more studies of the possible mechanisms as well as larger trials are still needed to confirm these observations.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight patients with erosive reflux esophagitis were allocated to either sucralfate tablets, 4 g/day, or cimetidine, 1.6 g/day, for 8 weeks in a randomized, prospective, single-blind, cross-over therapeutic trial. Pretreatment lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and serum pepsinogen I (PG-I) levels were investigated as possible predictors of healing with either drug. The trial was completed by 41 patients (21 in the sucralfate group and 20 in the cimetidine group); one patient in each group was removed because of side effects. Symptom improvement occurred to a similar extent in both groups. Endoscopic results after 8 weeks of treatment with sucralfate revealed complete healing of esophageal erosions in 48% (cimetidine, 55%) and improvement in an additional 19% (cimetidine, 20%). Neither of these differences was statistically significant. Some patients refractory to one drug had endoscopic healing of esophagitis when treated with the other drug after crossover. LES pressure did not influence outcome in patients treated with sucralfate, whereas significantly (p = 0.024) more patients refractory to cimetidine had an LES pressure less than 7 mm Hg than did those with a good response to the histamine-2 (H2)-receptor blockade. Patients whose esophagitis healed or improved after sucralfate tended to have lower serum PG-I levels than those with treatment failure (104 +/- 35 ng/mL vs 125 +/- 45 ng/mL), whereas the opposite occurred in patients treated with cimetidine (132 +/- 58 ng/mL in responders vs 78 +/- 27 ng/mL in nonresponders, p = 0.048). The results confirm that sucralfate is a valuable alternative to H2-receptor inhibitors for the treatment of reflux esophagitis. They also provide preliminary evidence that LES pressures and serum PG-I levels may have predictive value of the response to one or the other of these two drugs.\r"

Thirty patients, 19 treated with cimetidine and 11 treated with sucralfate, had esophageal motility studied by a radionuclide test before and after 12 weeks of treatment. The efficacy of the treatments was judged by symptoms and endoscopic response after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. The endpoint healing rate was approximately 60% in both groups and symptoms were relieved in half of the patients in both groups (difference not significant). The effect of the treatments on pH and number of spikes reflected the different pharmacodynamic profiles of the drugs, whereas the mean transit time (MTT) was not changed by the treatments. The residual activity after radionuclide transit in the sitting position was significantly increased after treatment with cimetidine. The data support the hypothesis that primary dysmotility might be involved in the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis in about 33% of the patients. Possibilities for a combination therapy with sucralfate and cimetidine are stressed.\r"

Inclusion criteria were symptomatic reflux (number and severity of attacks) and endoscopic evidence of esophagitis (grades 1 to 4). Clinical assessments were performed on entry, and at 4 and at 8 weeks, and endoscopy was repeated at 8 weeks. Sc suspension and Rn placebo or Sc placebo and Rn tablets were taken on waking and immediately before retiring at night. Of the 125 patients, 27 were withdrawn because of default (Rn = 4; Sc = 14), noncompliance (Rn = 1; Sc = 2), or the development of congestive cardiac failure (Rn = 1), diarrhea (Rn = 1; Sc = 1), nausea (Sc = 1), constipation (Sc = 1), and hematemesis (Sc = 1). Analysis was performed on the remaining 98 patients, 43 of whom had been treated with Sc and 55 with Rn. Heartburn, acid regurgitation, epigastric pain, dysphagia, and chest pain were relieved in 34% vs 40%, 67% vs 72%, 71% vs 57%, and 86% vs 63% for Sc and Rn, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups. Endoscopic healing occurred in 47% of the Sc- and in 31% of the Rn-treated patients (chi 2 = 2.50), and healing or improvement was noted in 81% of the Sc- and 64% of the Rn-treated patients. This difference approached statistical significance (chi 2 = 3.73). There was no obvious endoscopic benefit in 8 of the 43 and 20 of the 55 patients in the groups treated with Sc and Rn, respectively. Although the findings with sucralfate and ranitidine in patients with reflux esophagitis completing the trial suggest a benefit of these agents, the absence of a placebo control group and the high default rates, particularly for those receiving sucralfate, preclude any firm conclusions as to relative or specific efficacy of these agents in this condition.\r"

Because this was an uncontrolled trial we planned a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study with 60 patients. After therapeutic paravariceal injection-sclerotherapy of esophageal varices, patients were randomly treated with sucralfate suspension or placebo. Time of treatment was limited to a maximum of 3 weeks and the dosage of sucralfate was 1 g q.i.d. (Ulcogant-Suspension). Healing was assessed by endoscopy at weekly intervals. Fifty-three patients (25 sucralfate, 28 placebo) were evaluable according to the protocol. No patient left the study because of side effects. At the start of the trial, the patients in the sucralfate group showed a larger ulcer area than the placebo group. There was a tendency to faster healing in the sucralfate group, especially in patients with deeper ulcerations. However, there was no significant difference in global healing between both treatment groups after 3 weeks. Sucralfate suspension may be of value in accelerating the healing process in esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy, especially in patients with deep ulcers. These results should be confirmed in further trials, in which patients should be stratified with respect to their ulcer volume and severity of liver disease.\r"

In a separate study, we have found that chronic steroid administration delays the healing of experimental gastric ulcers in rats. This study was designed to test the beneficial effects of sucralfate, cimetidine, and lansoprazole (AG-1749, a new proton pump inhibitor), on the delayed healing by steroids in rat chronic gastric ulcers. Chronic gastric ulcers were produced in male Wistar rats, weighing 180 g, by the application of 100% acetic acid. The rats were randomly divided into five groups; (1) control, (2) vehicle alone, (3) 10 mg/kg lansoprazole, (4) 500 mg/kg sucralfate, and (5) 100 mg/kg cimetidine. Except for controls, all rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of 2.5 mg/kg hydrocortisone sodium phosphate. Tested drugs were administered intragastrically (lansoprazole and sucralfate) or intraperitoneally (cimetidine) twice a day for 2 weeks. Rats were sacrificed 14 days later and ulcer size was measured. Chronic administration of hydrocortisone sodium phosphate resulted in a significant delay of ulcer healing induced by acetic acid. Treatment with either lansoprazole or sucralfate abolished the deleterious effect of steroids, whereas cimetidine had no effect. These results indicate that lansoprazole and sucralfate overcome the delayed healing by steroids of chronic gastric ulcers in the rat.\r"

The double-blind placebo-controlled study included 70 patients with carcinoma of the prostate and urinary bladder without distant metastasis (T1-4NO1xMO) and performance status of greater than or equal to 90% Karnofsky scale. Radiotherapy was administered in a conventional manner with MeV photons and a four-field technique. The total dose was 62-66 Gy and total treatment time of 6.5 weeks. Dose granules of sucralfate or placebo were dispensed to each patient 2 weeks after radiation started and continued for 6 weeks. All analyses were performed blindly. Seven of 34 evaluable patients in the placebo group and 18 of 32 evaluable patients in the sucralfate group did not present with diarrhea during the observation period. The frequency of defecation and stool consistency were significantly improved by sucralfate. Fourteen patients in the placebo group and only three in the sucralfate group required symptomatic therapy with loperamide. There was no evidence of adverse effects associated with the use of sucralfate. Sucralfate can be of beneficial value in diminishing the bowel discomfort during radiotherapy of pelvic malignancies, and the earlier proposed mechanisms of action (e.g., protection of denuded mucosa, cytoprotective properties, binding bile acids) can also be valid for the current effects of sucralfate.\r"

Thus, preservation of microvascular integrity seems to be one of the mechanisms of acute gastroprotection by sucralfate. Chronic experiments with subcutaneously implanted sponges containing sucralfate or SOS revealed that both compounds stimulated angiogenesis, whereas only sucralfate enhanced the area of granulation tissue. These processes may have a role in the ulcer-healing action of sucralfate.\r"

This study was designed to determine the importance of intragastric pH in the sucralfate-induced gastroprotection against 100% ethanol, acidified aspirin, taurocholate, or stress, and in the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcerations induced by acetic acid. Sucralfate acidified to pH 2.0 showed significantly stronger protective activity against all four irritants, its protective potency against 100% ethanol being about eight times greater and the duration of the protection about four times longer than those obtained with sucralfate at its pH of 5.0. Pretreatment with indomethacin to suppress mucosal generation of prostaglandin or the removal of salivary glands to eliminate the endogenous source of epidermal growth factor failed to affect sucralfate-induced gastroprotection. In contrast, the rate of healing of chronic gastric ulcerations was significantly delayed by indomethacin or sialoadenectomy; but sucralfate enhanced the healing, and a marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion by ranitidine did not eliminate this enhancement. We conclude that the protective activity of sucralfate depends on the presence of acid milieu in the stomach, but that the ulcer-healing effects of this drug occur even after a marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intragastric administration of sucralfate on the physicochemical properties of gastric mucus, and the mechanism of its protective action against alcohol-induced mucosal injury were investigated using in vivo and in vitro models. The experiments in vivo were conducted with groups of rats receiving a dose of 100 mg sucralfate twice daily for 5 consecutive days. The animals were sacrificed 16 hours after the last dose, their stomachs dissected, and the mucosa subjected to physicochemical measurements. In the in vitro studies, gastric mucosa was cultured in the presence of sucralfate, ethanol, or both. The in vivo results revealed that sucralfate elicited an 8% increase in mucus gel dimension, while its sulfo- and sialomucin content increased by 63% and 81%, respectively. The changes in mucus gel mucin content with sucralfate were accompanied by a 9.5% increase in mucus hydrogen ion (H+) retardation capacity, 1.9-fold increase in viscosity, and a 60% increase in the gel hydrophobicity. The mucus elaborated in the presence of sucralfate exhibited 14% lower protein content and 62% higher content of carbohydrate than that of control, and contained more neutral lipids. Furthermore, the gastric mucus of the sucralfate group showed a marked increase in mucus glycoprotein polymeric form. The data obtained with gastric mucosal culture demonstrated that sucralfate elicited a significant increase in mucin synthesis, which was reflected in the enhanced metabolism of mucosal phosphoinositides. In contrast, ethanol, which exhibited detrimental effects on mucin synthesis, also caused alterations in the phosphoinositide signal pathway. The changes in mucin and phosphoinositide distribution patterns evoked by ethanol were prevented by sucralfate. Our results suggest that the mucosal strengthening action of sucralfate occurs through the stimulation of the metabolism of phosphoinositide-derived messenger molecules.\r"

Usually such ulceration is uniformly fatal unless a highly selective vagotomy is performed simultaneously with the BDL. The administration of sucralfate to pigs with BDL prolonged their survival for up to 7 days, with evidence of healing of the ulcer on macroscopic and histologic observations. An increase in cell proliferation in the squamous epithelium of the ulcerated area was also seen in this sucralfate group. These features were not seen in controls, pigs with BDL only, or pigs with BDL and with magaldrate (Riopone), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (DeNol), or carbenoxolone. Analysis by Sepharose 2B gel filtration showed that there was no significant difference in the amounts of polymeric mucin in any group, with a wide scatter of the data seen especially for pigs in the untreated BDL-only group. This study suggests that sucralfate may enhance healing in this experimental pig ulcer model via a mechanism independent of the stimulation of mucus secretion. We propose that coating the mucosa with sucralfate provides a temporary substitute barrier that creates a microenvironment conducive to wound repair by mucosal proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "A novel explanation for the action of sucralfate in gastric ulcers has been proposed based on a new theory for gastric mucosal protection derived, in effect, from the very common industrial practice of adsorbing surfactants to surfaces needing protection against acid. Standard physical tests have been employed to show that sucralfate is highly surface-active at both liquid and solid interfaces, with the capability to be adsorbed--but not as active as the indigenous surface-active phospholipid (SAPL). This finding can explain the ability of sucralfate to \"bind\" to an ulcer site. Unlike SAPL or surfactants in general, adsorbed sucralfate does not render hydrophilic surfaces hydrophobic, suggesting a dual role in substituting for both SAPL and the mucus needed to stabilize it. Electron microscopy, using a novel fixation procedure specifically designed to allow for the known properties of any gastric mucosal barrier, revealed essentially the same oligolamellar lining of SAPL as previously reported in rats. Prolonged (16-day) exposure to sucralfate did not appear to change the situation, whereas there were as many, if not more, lamellar bodies (freshly secreted SAPL) adjacent to the stomach wall. Mucus-free oxyntic ducts showed the same oligolamellar lining as controls. An interesting new finding was the presence of oligolamellar SAPL as the intergranular matrix of gastric mucus--as though preparing to protect the next layer in anticipation of the surface mucin granules being eroded.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the mechanisms of the effects of sucralfate on the stomach, we investigated the action of sucrose octasulfate (SOS), a constituent of sucralfate, on the function of canine gastric parietal cells and somatostatin cells and in the isolated perfused intact rat stomach. Somatostatin cells from the canine gastric fundus were isolated by EDTA-collagenase dispersion and counterflow elutriation, and somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) release in response to SOS was measured by radioimmunoassay. Similar methods were used to isolate gastric parietal cells, in which gastric acid secretion was measured by uptake of a radiolabeled weak base, [14C]aminopyrine. SLI release by the intact rat stomach was examined in an isolated vascularly perfused rat stomach model. SOS, either alone or co-administered with epinephrine or gastrin heptadecapeptide (G17), dose-dependently stimulated SLI release by isolated canine fundic D-cells. At the highest doses, SOS potentiated the effect of epinephrine but not G17. Similarly, SOS potentiated the stimulating effect of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (DBcAMP), but not 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The effect of SOS on SLI release could be inhibited by octreotide, a somatostatin analogue. SOS did not alter acid secretion by cultured canine parietal cells either in the basal state or when coadministered with acid secretagogues. In isolated perfused rat stomach studies, SOS produced a significant (60% greater than basal) increase in SLI secretion. There was a similar effect when SOS was perfused against a background of isoproterenol. SOS stimulates SLI release from gastric somatostatin cells and from the isolated perfused stomach but has no direct effect on gastric parietal cells. These actions of SOS may mediate in part the apparent ability of sucralfate to enhance gastric mucosal defense.\r"

  ".U": "91353663\r", 
  ".W": "Over the past 5-10 years, a number of studies have shown that topical sucralfate enhances a number of gastric and duodenal mechanisms, e.g., the \"mucus-bicarbonate barrier,\" mucosal hydrophobicity, mucosal blood flow, cell viability, and local production of prostaglandins, as well as endogenous mediators of tissue injury and repair. It seems likely that the complex actions of sucralfate are in part related to direct interaction between the drug or its components (aluminum, sucrose, and sulfate) and gastric mucosal tissues, and in part related to effects of the drug on the various mucosal mediators of tissue injury and repair. Local actions may play a role in accelerating healing of ulcer-damaged mucosa, but this does not explain the protective actions of sucralfate on normal mucosa. Thus sucralfate appears to enhance the protective function of the \"mucus-bicarbonate\" barrier by actions on both components. This may depend in part on an interaction with the unstirred layer overlying gastric epithelium. Sucralfate has also been shown to increase the hydrophobicity of mucus gel. There is little doubt that sucralfate increases local production and release of protective prostaglandins (PGs), but the precise role played by these agents in mediating mucosal protection and in chronic ulcer healing remains uncertain. Currently, the mechanism of action of sucralfate on vascular integrity remains unknown and the role of PGs in this protective function is unclear. There is little evidence that epidermal growth factor plays any role in mediating mucosal protection by sucralfate, but it may be important in its ulcer-healing action. Sucralfate has been shown to be truly \"cytoprotective\" in that it protects isolated epithelial cells from damage by noxious agents. In animals treated with sucralfate, the surface epithelial cells were disrupted, but necrotic lesions in the deep proliferative zone were virtually absent. It seems likely that investigations of the actions of sucralfate and its components will move ever closer to defining the target cells, the intracellular events, and the mediators that bring about its protective and ulcer-healing activity.\r"

Of 46 patients eligible for the analysis of healing rates, four patients in the b.i.d. group (all at 8 weeks) and five patients in the q.i.d. group (two at 4 weeks and three at 8 weeks) were withdrawn due to patients' inconvenience. As the possibility that the withdrawals were due to the treatment failures could not be denied, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and generalized Wilcoxon test/logrank test for the calculation and evaluation of healing rates in this study, respectively. Healing rates at 4 and 8 weeks were 50% and 94% in the b.i.d. group and 35% and 68% in the q.i.d. group. There was no significant difference in healing rates between the groups. No serious adverse effect was observed in either group. These results suggest that the 2 g b.i.d. dose of sucralfate in granule form is at least as effective as the conventional dose of 1 g q.i.d. in the treatment of active gastric ulcers and could lead to better patient compliance.\r"

Only patients who had a symptomatic relapse within 1 year after H2-blocker therapy were included. Patients with no relapses within 1 year after sucralfate were assumed to have a relapse on day 366, in order to compare the two periods. In 73% of the evaluable 2,045 patients, remission after sucralfate was longer than after H2-blocker, and 23% of these patients had no symptomatic relapse at all within 1 year after sucralfate. The average relapse-free period after sucralfate was 212 days, as compared with 132 days after H2-blockers (difference = 80 days; p less than 0.0001). Elderly and nonsmoking patients and those experiencing their first recurrence, or who had a duodenal ulcer, benefited especially from acute treatment with sucralfate. It can be concluded that peptic ulcer patients with a relapse after treatment with an H2-blocker are suitable candidates for sucralfate therapy. There is a high probability that the relapse-free period after sucralfate is longer than after H2-blocker treatment in both gastric and duodenal ulcer patients.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to compare the efficacy of sucralfate to placebo for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence and to determine that the efficacy of sucralfate was due to a true reduction in ulcer prevalence and not due to secondary effects such as analgesic activity or accelerated healing. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, multicenter clinical study with 254 patients. All patients had a past history of at least two duodenal ulcers with at least one ulcer diagnosed by endoscopic examination 3 months or less before the start of the study. Complete ulcer healing without erosions was required to enter the study. Sucralfate or placebo were dosed as a 1-g tablet twice a day for 4 months, or until ulcer recurrence. Endoscopic examinations once a month and when symptoms developed determined the presence or absence of duodenal ulcers. If a patient developed an ulcer between monthly scheduled visits, the patient was dosed with a 1-g sucralfate tablet twice a day until the next scheduled visit. Statistical analyses of the results determined the efficacy of sucralfate compared with placebo for preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence. Comparisons of therapeutic agents for preventing duodenal ulcers have usually been made by testing for statistical differences in the cumulative rates for all ulcers developed during a follow-up period, regardless of the time of detection. Statistical experts at the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and on the FDA Advisory Panel expressed doubts about clinical study results based on this type of analysis. They suggested three possible mechanisms for reducing the number of observed ulcers: (a) analgesic effects, (b) accelerated healing, and (c) true ulcer prevention. Traditional ulcer analysis could miss recurring ulcers due to an analgesic effect or accelerated healing. Point-prevalence analysis could miss recurring ulcers due to accelerated healing between endoscopic examinations. Maximum ulcer analyses, a novel statistical method, eliminated analgesic effects by regularly scheduled endoscopies and accelerated healing of recurring ulcers by frequent endoscopies and an open-label phase. Maximum ulcer analysis reflects true ulcer recurrence and prevention. Sucralfate was significantly superior to placebo in reducing ulcer prevalence by all analyses. Significance (p less than 0.05) was found at months 3 and 4 for all analyses. All months were significant in the traditional analysis, months 2-4 in point-prevalence analysis, and months 3-4 in the maximal ulcer prevalence analysis. Sucralfate was shown to be effective for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence by a true reduction in new ulcer development.\r"

The second study was carried out 3 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the sucralfate- and Maalox-treated groups and 14 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the omeprazole-treated patients. Acid output (mmol/hour) was measured as basal secretion, and in response to 0.1 microgram/kg/hour pentagastrin (low-dose) and 6.0 micrograms/kg/hour pentagastrin (high-dose) stimulation. PCS was calculated as the ratio of low dose:high dose acid output (expressed as a percentage).

Ulcer healing with omeprazole resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in basal acid output from 6.3 (1.5-22.9) (median [range]) to 2.2 (0-6.9) mmol/hour, and low-dose acid output from 31.0 (6.0-58.0) to 23.0 (1.4-44.8) mmol/hour.

Recent studies comparing the effects of ranitidine or sucralfate on changes in the acid secretory responses in the healing of duodenal ulcers are described, and the relevance of these changes to early relapse considered. The duration of therapy and timing of acid-secretory studies and endoscopies are standardized in all studies, but the acid-secretory parameters vary. These comprised acid secretory responses to graded doses of an intravenous infusion of pentagastrin or histamine, sham-feeding responses, and basal and nocturnal acid secretion. In all studies, healing with sucralfate was associated with a significant decrease in the various parameters of acid secretion. In the ranitidine-healed groups, no appreciable decrease was noted and there was, indeed, a significant increase in nocturnal acid secretion. Routine endoscopies performed 4-6 weeks after documented ulcer healing showed a recurrence of 3 of the 32 (9%) sucralfate-healed and in 14 of the 35 (40%) ranitidine-healed ulcers. Increased acid secretory responsiveness following duodenal ulcer healing was strongly correlated with subsequent early relapse.\r"

Pronounced macular retinal pigment epithelial disruption or mottling was present in the father of the propositus, who also had markedly reduced electroretinogram rod and cone responses. The extent of electroretinogram amplitude reduction indicates abnormal function of the peripheral retina in addition to the clinically evident macular changes. Affected family members showed peripheral retinal pigment epithelial granularity. Central visual acuity remained normal despite the presence of macular lesions.\r"

The lesions were characteristically yellow to pale yellow in color, appeared at the level of the choroid, and were found in the posterior pole. They varied in size from 300 to 3,000 microns, initially increasing in number before treatment and eventually resolving after systemic antimicrobial therapy. Of the 21 patients, 18 (86%) had received inhaled pentamidine as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia. Visual acuity and visual field testing showed little evidence of retinal destruction. Survival after the diagnosis of the choroidopathy ranged from two to 36 weeks. Pneumocystic choroidopathy offers an easily accessible clue to disseminated Pneumocystis infection. When comparing drugs for Pneumocystis prophylaxis, careful ocular examination can provide one indicator of the relative efficacy of protection against extrapulmonary disease.\r"

Serum from healthy individuals and patients with Lyme disease served as negative and positive control samples, respectively. Significantly higher antibody titers were demonstrated in patients with uveitis than in control subjects. Of 29 patients with unclassified uveitis, nine (31) had significantly increased antibody titers against B. burgdorferi strain H014 by ELISA testing. Five patients also showed higher IgG and IgM responses than in three control subjects with Lyme disease. All positive controls showed joint problems characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. One of three patients had uveitis. The patients were diagnosed as having Lyme disease on the basis of their history and serologic tests. A positive antibody response was recognized in several patients with Behcet's disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, sarcoidosis, and other conditions (acute anterior uveitis with ankylosing spondylitis), but not in control subjects.\r"

Initially, leaking macroaneurysms developed in the shunt area of the arteriovenous communication; later, a preexistent fusiform macroaneurysm in the afferent arteriole of the congenital communication started leaking. Because exudates and fluid from the leaking macroaneurysms reached the fovea, laser treatment was performed to obliterate the macroaneurysms. We assume that after obliteration of the macroaneurysms with laser in the shunt area, the increase of hydrostatic pressure on the thin wall of the fusiform aneurysm of the afferent artery led to its leaking. We saw no signs of vascular occlusion after laser treatment.\r"

In these characteristics, the tumor cells were identical to nonpigmented ciliary epithelium of the ciliary processes. These growths contained abundant extracellular material, which showed a dimorphic pattern of complex reduplicated basal lamina and granular areas without structure. Immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded coronal adenomas demonstrated type IV collagen and laminin in the extracellular material. These findings confirm that coronal adenomas develop from nonpigmented ciliary epithelium and that the extracellular material of these tumors contains components normally present in basement membranes.\r"

Topography analysis documented cone progression during a two-year period. The initial map showed a cone apex power of 44.5 diopters located 2.1 mm inferior to the vertex normal. An oblong-shaped area of maximum power was surrounded by concentric bands of lower power. Corneal surface power ranged from 41.5 to 44.5 diopters. Two years later cone apex power increased to 51.0 diopters, and the patient developed a Fleischer's ring, Vogt's striae, and mild visual aberration. Our findings suggest the use of topography analysis systems in documenting subclinical cone progression. Topography systems may be a useful tool in the study of the true incidence and natural progression of subclinical keratoconus.\r"

The multiple resistance patterns of these strains to antibiotic susceptibility testing emphasizes the need for culturing ocular infections. We recommend the identification and susceptibility testing of all ocular gram-negative rod isolates.\r"

Thirty-seven of the 39 patients (95%) in the 0.25% levobunolol group and 35 of the 41 patients (85%) in the 0.25% timolol group successfully completed the three-month study period. The overall mean decrease in intraocular pressure was 5.3 mm Hg (22%) in the 0.25% levobunolol group and 5.4 mm Hg (22%) in the 0.25% timolol group. This difference was not statistically significant. In both treatment groups, effects on mean heart rate and blood pressure were minimal.

To explore the relationship between cervical and ocular human papillomavirus infection, we examined DNA from bilateral limbal swabs and cervical swabs from 17 women (age range, 17 to 46 years; median, 31.7 years) with biopsy-proven human papillomavirus-related cervical dysplasia who had a normal ocular surface. Using polymerase chain reaction, we identified human papillomavirus 16 DNA in one or both eyes of 13 (76.5%) patients, six (46.2%) of whom had demonstrable human papillomavirus 16 DNA in cervical swabs as well. It thus appears that human papillomavirus 16 is present in the conjunctivae of some patients with human papillomavirus-related genital warts who have no ocular manifestations of infection. Although autoinoculation of conjunctiva may be the source of some ocular human papillomavirus, data suggest that other modes of transmission to the eye also exist. Additional study of the epidemiologic characteristics of ocular human papillomavirus, a widely prevalent virus known to be associated with dysplasias/atypias and cancer, is warranted.\r"

The pigment granules in these benign pigmented lesions are much larger than are observed in uveal melanomas. When they were visible through the heavy pigmentation, the cellular detail appeared benign. In two cases the tumors were successfully resected with cyclochroidectomy techniques and the visual outcome was good. The third eye was studied after it had been removed at another institution. Fine needle aspiration biopsy can often differentiate a benign-simulating pigmented lesion from uveal melanoma.\r"

Intrathecally produced viral antibodies were found in three consecutive patients with acute retinal necrosis syndrome: herpes simplex type 2 in a 30-year-old woman with a history of suspected neonatal herpes encephalitis, herpes simplex type 1 in a 35-year-old man, and varicella-zoster virus activity in a 62-year-old woman.

All patients but one were monitored until time of death. The postoperative survival time and the factors that predicted anatomic success (retinal attachment) and functional success (visual acuity) were analyzed. No intraoperative complications were encountered. The mean survival time after surgery was four months. Of all of the preoperative and intraoperative factors studied, only the duration of cytomegalovirus retinitis was predictive of survival (P less than .03). The anatomic success rate was 89.5% (17 of 19 patients). None of the factors showed a trend or statistical significance in relation to anatomic success. Fifteen of 19 patients (79%) had lost at least two lines of Snellen visual acuity at time of death. Vision declined in a bimodal pattern (within the first postoperative month and after four months postoperatively). The optic nerve was pink and well perfused preoperatively in 16 of 19 patients (81.8%), but optic-nerve atrophy was observed postoperatively in 18 of 19 patients (95.5%). There was a trend for functional success to be influenced by increased intraocular pressure and optic-nerve atrophy, although our sample size was too small for statistical significance.\r"

In nine patients, cytomegalovirus retinopathy was the only disorder that fulfilled the Centers for Disease Control criteria for diagnosis of AIDS. In the other six, examination disclosed additional preexistent or concurrent nonocular disorders that were also diagnostic of AIDS. No demographic, medical, or ophthalmic characteristics distinguished the nine patients for whom cytomegalovirus retinopathy was initially the only manifestation of AIDS. On the basis of published figures for the prevalence of cytomegalovirus retinopathy in patients with AIDS, and the incidence with which HIV-infected persons develop AIDS, it is estimated that approximately 1.8% of patients with AIDS have cytomegalovirus retinopathy as the first manifestation and that less than 1% of HIV-infected persons will develop cytomegalovirus retinopathy as the initial manifestation of AIDS during the first seven years after infection with HIV.\r"

Of the 23 patients not treated with acyclovir, seven (30.4%) had fellow eyes that remained disease-free throughout a median follow-up of 11 months. Survival analysis indicated that the fellow eyes of the group of patients treated with acyclovir were more likely to remain disease-free than the fellow eyes of the group not treated with acyclovir (P = .0013). Two years after initial onset, the proportion of fellow eyes that remained disease-free was 75.3% for the group treated with acyclovir and 35.1% for the group not treated with acyclovir. These results suggest that acyclovir treatment reduces the risk of involvement of the fellow eye in patients with acute retinal necrosis.\r"

In a family with a stop codon mutation at the carboxyl end of the molecule (glutamine-344), young members with the mutation were asymptomatic and clinically unaffected but showed about 1 log unit of rod sensitivity loss across the visual field and decreased rhodopsin levels; at this stage, cone function was essentially normal. In three families with mutations at the border of a transmembrane segment (arginine-135-leucine and arginine-135-tryptophan), there was neither detectable rod function nor measurable rhodopsin; cone function was variably impaired. Two families carrying different mutations (threonine-17-methionine and threonine-58-arginine) had altitudinal visual field defects with less impaired rod and cone function in the inferior than in the superior field. Rod adaptation was abnormal in both families, but the time course of adaptation differed between patients with the two mutations. Differences in the pattern of retinal dysfunction were therefore discernible in patients with different rhodopsin mutations.\r"

Gas-fluid and gas-tissue interfaces were so highly reflective that no structures within or behind a bubble could be visualized. Shadowing, reverberation, and reflection artifacts were prominent, and dominated ultrasonographic findings. If the ultrasonographic characteristics of gas are understood, it is possible to use B-scan ultrasonography to determine if intraocular gas is present, whether there are one or several bubbles, and what percentage of the vitreous cavity is filled by gas. Specular reflection from a gas-fluid interface may be used to examine portions of the eye that might not otherwise be easily seen with ultrasonography.\r"

The most commonly isolated organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp., occurring in eight of 18 isolates (44%). No eyes in our study developed endophthalmitis, even though almost one half had viable organisms growing from the anterior chamber aspirates. Inoculum sizes were extremely small (10 to 20 colony-forming units/ml). This study suggests that in humans, the anterior chamber is capable of clearing a low inoculum of bacteria after cataract surgery without the development of endophthalmitis.\r"

Patients (25 men and 25 women; age range, 41 to 91 years; mean age, 75 years) had a wide range of systemic and ocular disease; 17 of 50 (34%) patients had a history of severe vision-impairing cataract in a first-degree relative. Anterior lens-capsule thickness ranged from 10 to 22 microns, with a mean of 17 microns. Statistical analysis of lens-epithelium ultrastructure in 41 of 50 specimens documented mixing of normal and abnormal cells, verified a gradation in the degree of abnormal ultrastructural features, and demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in epithelial cytologic activity with advancing age (P = .038). Biochemical analysis documented a severe glutathione reductase deficiency in nine of 39 (23%) lens-epithelium specimens, possibly reflecting a dietary deficiency of riboflavin.\r"

We used the technique of conjunctival impression cytology to evaluate the conjunctival changes that develop with long-term use of topically administered antiglaucoma medications. Patients with glaucoma who were on a stable regimen of one, two, or three topically administered medications were recruited for study; glaucoma suspects who were not using topically administered medications served as controls. Eyes with clinical or historical evidence of external eye disease or conjunctival surgery were excluded. Impression cytology specimens, collected from the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, were coded and subsequently graded by a masked observer. We examined specimens from 72 eyes by using this technique. Aggregate scores for the bulbar conjunctiva were compiled, using a previously described grading system with a range of 0 (normal) to 3 (diffuse, severe metaplasia). The results show statistically significant degrees of conjunctival metaplasia associated with the number of glaucoma medications used. These results suggest that the long-term use of antiglaucoma medications induces changes in the conjunctival surface. These changes may be related to the medications themselves, the preservatives in the commercial preparations, or the duration of topical treatment. The clinical relevance of these changes remains unknown.\r"

Eyes with ocular hypertension were not significantly different from normal eyes. Significant differences were noted at several spatial frequencies with less careful controls for age and lens effects.

A total of 216 patients with anterior uveitis were studied. The uveitis was acute in 155. Of the 155 patients, 11 (7.1%) had hypopyon. Nine of the 11 patients with hypopyon were positive for HLA B27. Of these nine, two had Reiter's syndrome and one had ankylosing spondylitis; the other six had no confirmed systemic disease. Of the two patients with hypopyon who were HLA B27-negative, one had mixed connective-tissue vascular disease, and one had idiopathic anterior uveitis. Of the 155 patients with acute anterior uveitis, 62 were HLA B27-positive. Thus, the incidence of hypopyon uveitis among HLA B27-positive patients was 14.5% (nine of 62 patients), whereas the incidence among HLA B27-negative patients was only 2.2% (two of 93 patients). These results suggest that HLA B27-related anterior uveitis is the most common cause of hypopyon uveitis, and that most patients with anterior uveitis associated with hypopyon will test positive for HLA B27. Although these results reflect a referral population, they should be of benefit in the treatment of patients with anterior uveitis.\r"

Cochet-Bonnet measurements were made in both eyes before and at two- to five-minute intervals after the instillation of one drop of 0.5% proparacaine until baseline corneal sensitivity levels were again achieved. Mean recovery time was 34.86 minutes in eyes with normal corneal sensitivity, compared to 45.43 minutes in hypesthetic corneas. In all patients, the recovery time was remarkably longer in the hypesthetic eye than it was in the normal fellow eye. These data demonstrate the need to wait up to one hour after the instillation of proparacaine in eyes suspected of having corneal hypesthesia if corneal sensitivity is to be determined accurately. Additionally, the duration of action of topically instilled anesthetic may be a useful method of discovering subtle differences in corneal sensitivity.\r"

  ".U": "91353760\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Body dysmorphic disorder, a preoccupation with an imagined defect in physical appearance, has a rich tradition in European psychiatry but has been largely neglected in the United States. Because this little-known disorder is probably more common than is generally realized and can have profound consequences, the author reviews its history, clinical features, and possible relationship to other psychiatric disorders. DATA COLLECTION: Data sources consisted of the MEDLINE database and relevant references in articles obtained from this search. Of 145 articles and books obtained, 100 were selected for inclusion in this review on the basis of how closely they conformed to the concept of body dysmorphic disorder as defined in DSM-III-R and how substantially they contributed to an understanding of the disorder's history, clinical features, or nosologic status. FINDINGS: Body dysmorphic disorder has been colorfully described in the European literature for more than a century. Although its concerns might sound trivial, this disorder can lead to social isolation (including being housebound), occupational dysfunction, unnecessary cosmetic surgery, and suicide. The most commonly associated psychiatric disorder appears to be depression. Although a definitive treatment does not exist, preliminary evidence suggests that serotonergic antidepressant medications may be useful. Whether body dysmorphic disorder is related to other psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, mood disorder, social phobia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, is unclear at this time. CONCLUSIONS: More research on the nosology, clinical features, and treatment response of body dysmorphic disorder is important, given the distress and impairment this often secret disorder can cause.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: The article reviews the literature on the psychodynamics of suicide, focusing on factors that will help in evaluating and treating the young suicidal patient. Articles published in refereed journals and books and book chapters based on such articles are the source of most of the material. Articles that first brought a new finding to notice are given preference. Methodological limitations and contradictions with the data of other studies are pointed out. FINDINGS: The psychodynamic meaning of suicide for a patient derives from both affective and cognitive components. Rage, hopelessness, despair, and guilt are important affective states in which young patients commit suicide. The meanings of suicide can be usefully organized around the conscious (cognitive) and unconscious meanings given to death by the suicidal patient: death as reunion, death as rebirth, death as retaliatory abandonment, death as revenge, and death as self-punishment or atonement. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the psychodynamics helps to distinguish which patients with any given diagnosis are at risk for suicide. Such knowledge is essential to the psychotherapeutic treatment of the young suicidal patient. Topics for future research include the role of anxiety in suicide; the capacity to bear hopelessness, rage, and other unpleasant affects without regression; the use of particular defense mechanisms in distinguishing the risk of either suicidal or violent behavior; and the relation of specific psychodynamic conflicts seen in suicidal patients to particular psychiatric diagnoses.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and type of psychotic symptoms in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and to test whether there is a relationship between specific psychotic symptoms and episodes of physical aggression. METHOD: From 209 patients with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease who had been assessed in a research clinic every 6 months for up to 4.5 years, 181 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease were selected for study. On the basis of the summary note for each visit in the patients' charts, the presence of delusions, hallucinations, misidentifications, and episodes of physical aggression was determined. Data regarding psychotic symptoms and aggression were available for 170 and 169 subjects, respectively. RESULTS: Delusions had been reported for 74 (43.5%) of the patients and were the most frequent psychotic symptom; persecutory delusions were the most common type. Physical aggression had been noted for 50 (29.6%) of the patients. Delusions and misidentifications frequently preceded and were significantly associated with episodes of physical aggression. The presence of delusions was a significant predictor of physical aggression but accounted for only 3.5% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that delusions are a risk factor for physical aggression in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease who have moderate to severe cognitive impairment. As delusions accounted for only a small percentage of the variance, further research is needed to identify other variables that may be significant predictors of physical aggression in this population.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The performance on standard clinical and psychometric assessments of eight elderly individuals with major unipolar depression alone and seven with depression plus mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type was compared with that of 41 nondepressed subjects suffering from very mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, 66 with mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, and 83 age-matched subjects without senile dementia. METHOD: Subjects with depression alone, depression plus mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, and very mild and mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type met strict inclusionary and exclusionary criteria. A 90-minute semistructured interview, including several brief standardized clinical scales, was used to assign a Clinical Dementia Rating to each subject according to published guidelines, and each subject was given a 2-hour psychometric test battery. Data were analyzed by one-way multivariate analysis of variance to ascertain if there was an effect of group on clinical and psychometric test scores. RESULTS: The eight depressed subjects without concurrent dementia performed as well as the 83 nondepressed subjects without dementia on most clinical measures; however, their performance on most psychometric measures closely resembled that of the 41 nondepressed subjects with very mild dementia. The performance of the seven subjects with depression plus mild dementia was comparable to that of the 66 nondepressed subjects with mild dementia on most clinical and psychometric measures. CONCLUSIONS: Although depressed subjects performed as well as subjects without dementia on many clinical assessments, psychometric testing was not able to distinguish depressed subjects from those with very mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. This demonstrates the need for careful psychiatric evaluation before interpreting deficits on psychometric tests as indicating the presence of very mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.\r"

  ".U": "91353764\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Some investigators have suggested that major depression might be overdiagnosed in stroke patients because of changes in appetite, sleep, or sexual interest caused by their medical illness; others have suggested that depression may be underdiagnosed in stroke patients who deny symptoms of depression because of anosognosia, neglect, or aprosody. The authors' goal was to determine how frequently depressive symptoms occur in acute stroke patients with and without depressed mood to estimate how often diagnostic errors of inclusion or exclusion may be made. METHOD: They examined the rate of autonomic and psychological symptoms of depression in 205 patients who were consecutively hospitalized for acute stroke. Eighty-five (41%) of these patients had depressed mood, and 120 (59%) had no mood disturbance. Forty-six (54%) of the 85 patients with depressed mood (22% of all patients) were assigned the DSM-III diagnosis of major depression. RESULTS: The 120 patients without mood disturbance had a mean of one autonomic symptom, but the 85 patients with depressed mood had a mean of almost four. Tightening the diagnostic criteria to account for one more nonspecific autonomic symptom decreased the number of patients with major depression by only three; adding two more criteria decreased the number by only five. Thus, the rate of DSM-III major depression was 1% higher than the rate with one extra nonspecific autonomic symptom and 2% higher than the rate with two extra criteria. Conversely, loosening diagnostic criteria to account for denial of depressive illness increased the rate of major depression by only 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Both autonomic and psychological depressive symptoms are strongly associated with depressed mood in acute stroke patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study characterized objectively the hypersomnia frequently seen in the depressed phase of bipolar affective disorder. On the basis of previous work in sleep and affective disorders, it has been hypothesized that the hypersomnia is related to greater REM sleep. This hypothesis was tested by using a multiple sleep latency test to compare bipolar affective disorder with narcolepsy, a well-defined primary sleep disorder associated with known REM sleep dysfunction. METHOD: Twenty-five bipolar depressed patients were selected on the basis of complaints of hypersomnia. They underwent 2 nights of polysomnography followed by a multiple sleep latency test. Data on their nocturnal sleep and daytime naps were compared with similar data on 23 nondepressed narcoleptic patients referred for sleep evaluation. RESULTS: Despite their complaints of hypersomnia, no abnormalities were noted for the bipolar group in the results from the multiple sleep latency test. Contrary to the working hypothesis, REM sleep was notably absent during daytime naps in the depressed patients, in marked contrast to the findings for the narcoleptic group. CONCLUSIONS: The complaint of sleepiness in the hypersomnic bipolar depressed patient appears to be related to the lack of interest, withdrawal, decreased energy, or psychomotor retardation inherent in the anergic depressed condition, rather than an increase in true sleep propensity or REM sleep propensity.\r"

METHOD: The subjects were offspring of parents with schizophrenia or affective disorder and normal comparison subjects matched on age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Ratings of social competence (Premorbid Adjustment Scale), affective flattening and poverty of speech (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms), and positive formal thought disorder (Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms) were based on videotaped psychiatric interviews conducted in childhood (N = 144), early adolescence (N = 127), and adolescence (N = 106). RESULTS: In childhood, there were no significant group differences. In early adolescence, the subjects at risk for schizophrenia had poorer social competence than those at risk for affective disorder and the normal subjects. In early adolescence, the subjects at risk for schizophrenia also had greater positive thought disorder than those at risk for affective disorder but did not differ significantly from the normal subjects; there were no differences in negative symptoms. In adolescence, the subjects at risk for schizophrenia had poorer social competence and greater positive and negative symptoms than the adolescents at risk for affective disorder and the normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: During early adolescence and adolescence, poor social competence may be more characteristic of children at risk for schizophrenia than those at risk for affective disorder. Higher levels of positive and negative symptoms may also be specific to subjects at risk for schizophrenia, but only during adolescence.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Lateral ventricle enlargement in schizophrenia has been positively correlated with poor premorbid competence, negative symptoms, and poor treatment response and negatively correlated with concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA), a dopaminergic metabolite. The authors provide further evidence of a reciprocal relationship between lateral ventricle size and dopaminergic activity in schizophrenia. METHOD: They assessed the relationship between lateral ventricle enlargement (ventricle-brain ratio, VBR) and CSF neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations (HVA and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) in 45 patients with schizophrenia, 28 with affective disorders (19 patients with major depression and nine with bipolar disorder), and 91 normal comparison subjects. RESULTS: No group mean differences were significant. Although individual correlations of VBR with HVA and 5-HIAA were not statistically significant, the ratio of HVA to 5-HIAA was significantly correlated with VBR in the patients with schizophrenia, a finding consistent with dopaminergic-serotonergic balance hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that it is the balance between HVA and 5-HIAA rather than their absolute levels which is associated with brain morphology and that this relationship between brain chemistry and morphology may be characteristic of the normal range of functioning for these systems. In other words, independent of whether brain morphology and chemistry differentiate psychopathological from nonpsychopathological states, there may be an orderly relationship between lateral ventricle size and the balance between HVA and 5-HIAA balance that is especially prominent in schizophrenia.\r"

To determine whether outpatients with current panic disorders also report such differences, this study examined the suicide attempt rates, levels of suicidal ideation, and levels of hopelessness among four groups of psychiatric outpatients. METHOD: Structured clinical interviews were used to assign diagnoses to 900 consecutive psychiatric outpatients. These patients were administered the Scale for Suicide Ideation and the Beck Hopelessness Scale and were also questioned in detail about previous suicide attempts and past and present suicidal ideation. RESULTS: None (0.0%) of the 73 patients with primary panic disorder without agoraphobia reported having made suicide attempts during their lifetimes. One (1.3%) of the 78 patients who had panic disorder with agoraphobia, 34 (7.0%) of the 485 patients who had mood disorders, and four (1.5%) of the 264 patients who had other psychiatric disorders reported suicide attempts. The mean scores on the Scale for Suicide Ideation and the Beck Hopelessness Scale of the patients with panic disorders and other disorders were significantly lower than the mean scores of the patients with mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of suicidal ideation and behavior for psychiatric outpatients who had panic disorders were discrepant with those reported by the earlier group of investigators for a random community sample of persons who reported ever having had panic attacks or met criteria for panic disorders.\r"

  ".U": "91353769\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: In April 1989 an outbreak of illness suddenly afflicted student performers in Santa Monica, Calif., and an extensive investigation revealed no environmental cause. To clarify the details of the epidemic and determine whether mass hysteria occurred, the authors examined physical, psychological, and social factors that might have contributed to the outbreak. METHOD: Participating middle- and high-school performers were surveyed; 93% (N = 519) responded; cases were defined as students who had one or more symptoms during the outbreak. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors of illness. RESULTS: Characteristic features of mass hysteria were present, including preponderance of illness in girls, symptom transmission by sight or sound, presence of hyperventilation, and evidence of psychological or physical stress. Symptomatic and asymptomatic groups differed in frequency of several physical and psychological variables, but observing a friend become sick was the best predictor of the development of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm earlier research demonstrating multiple psychological and physical factors that contribute to such outbreaks, particularly symptom transmission through social networks. Investigators should explore social transmission as an additional characteristic feature of mass hysteria in order to facilitate early identification of future outbreaks.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was 1) to replicate previous work indicating that antidepressant medication is superior to placebo in the treatment of bulimia nervosa and 2) to assess the long-term efficacy of this form of treatment. METHOD: Eighty patients entered a three-phase treatment protocol. An 8-week double-blind initiation phase was used to compare the effects of desipramine and placebo. Patients who responded satisfactorily to desipramine entered a 16-week maintenance phase. Patients who remained well were then randomly assigned to either desipramine or placebo for 6 additional months (discontinuation phase). The primary outcome measure was binge frequency, which was assessed weekly by self-report diaries. RESULTS: In the initiation phase the superiority of desipramine over placebo in reducing binge frequency was demonstrated. Patients treated with desipramine had a mean reduction in binge frequency of 47% at termination, whereas patients taking placebo experienced a mean increase of 7%. Less than half of the patients treated with desipramine met the criteria for entering the maintenance phase, and 29% of the patients entering that phase relapsed in the following 4 months. There were not enough patients in the discontinuation phase to permit clear conclusions about the need for continued antidepressant medication after 6 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The study documents a beneficial effect of desipramine in the treatment of bulimia nervosa when compared to placebo. However, limited improvement and considerable relapse with continued treatment suggest serious limitations to the long-term efficacy of a single antidepressant trial in treating bulimia nervosa.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of initial and continued administration of buspirone on sleep induction and maintenance and sleep stage parameters, to determine the presence or absence of any drug-induced side effects, and to ascertain the presence or absence of sleep disturbances following abrupt withdrawal of the drug. METHOD: Six insomniac subjects who had chronic complaints of difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep and who were in good physical health, were not suffering from any major mental disorders, and had not used any medication for at least the last month participated in a 16-night sleep laboratory protocol. The protocol consisted of 4 placebo-baseline nights, 7 nights on which buspirone, 10 mg at bedtime, was administered, and 5 placebo-withdrawal nights. RESULTS: Wake time after sleep onset increased moderately during the first 3 nights of drug administration (there was a marked and significant increase on the first night) and increased by lesser degrees with continued drug administration. Overall, reports of side effects were infrequent. Following drug termination, there was a delayed and mild increase in sleep difficulty above baseline. CONCLUSIONS: These data not only confirm that buspirone lacks sedative effects but also suggest that the drug may have stimulant properties. Further, these findings suggest that buspirone has limited usefulness in anxious patients with concomitant sleep difficulties.\r"

METHOD: Thirteen consecutively admitted outpatients were offered behavioral treatment consisting of contingency management procedures and the community reinforcement approach. Fifteen consecutively admitted outpatients were offered treatment with 12-step counseling. All 13 of the patients who were offered the behavioral treatment accepted it; 12 of the patients offered 12-step counseling accepted it. RESULTS: Eleven of the 13 patients in the behavioral treatment were retained for 12 weeks of treatment, compared with five of the 12 patients given 12-step counseling. Ten of the patients given behavioral therapy achieved 4 weeks of continuous cocaine abstinence, compared with only three of those given 12-step counseling. Six of the patients in the behavioral treatment group achieved 8 weeks, and three achieved 12 weeks; none of the patients in the 12-step counseling program achieved 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral treatment described in this paper offers promise as an effective intervention for achieving initial cocaine abstinence. A randomized trial is underway to assess the generality of these findings.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The authors determined the seroprevalence of HIV-1 among patients admitted to two psychiatric hospitals in New York City. METHOD: Patients consecutively admitted to an acute psychiatric unit in Manhattan and a large state hospital in Queens were anonymously tested for HIV-1 antibodies from December 1989 through July 1990. Test results were linked to age, gender, ethnicity, and two risk behaviors: male homosexual activity and injection drug use. RESULTS: Blood was obtained from 83.0% of the eligible patients. The prevalence of HIV was 5.5% (25 of 451). Black patients accounted for 38.0% of the patients tested and 76.0% of positive results (N = 19), a rate of 11.1% for this group. The rate of seropositivity was comparable in women and men. Clinicians had charted risk behavior for nine (36.0%) of the 25 HIV-positive patients. Infection control records suggested that clinicians were aware of seven (28.0%) of the positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: One in every 18 patients admitted to two public psychiatric hospitals in New York City was HIV positive. Clinical staff largely failed to identify HIV-positive patients. Ethnicity and a history of homosexual activity among men or use of injected drugs were strongly associated with seropositivity. This pattern of infection may be linked to needle sharing and/or sexual activity with partners who have shared needles. Future research should clarify how psychiatric illness affects risk-taking behavior, focus on improving detection by clinicians, and identify effective prevention strategies in this population.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether relative vitamin D deficiency during the winter months contributes to age-related bone loss and whether rates of change in hard- and soft-tissue mass vary during the year. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1-year trial in 249 women in which equal numbers of women were randomized to either placebo or 400 IU of vitamin D daily. All women received 377 mg/d of supplemental calcium largely as calcium citrate malate. PATIENTS: Healthy, ambulatory postmenopausal women with usual intakes of vitamin D of 100 IU/d. MEASUREMENTS: Duplicate spine and whole-body scans were done by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at 6-month intervals that were timed to periods when 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were highest and lowest. Period 1 was June-July to December-January and period 2 was December-January to the next June-July. Serum parathyroid hormone and plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured during periods 1 and 2. MAIN RESULTS: In the placebo group, spinal bone mineral density increased in period 1, decreased in period 2, and sustained no net change. Women treated with vitamin D had a similar spinal increase in period 1 (1.46% compared with 1.40% in placebo), less loss in period 2 (-0.54% compared with -1.22%, CI for the difference, 0.05% to 1.31%, P = 0.032) and a significant overall benefit (0.85% compared with 0.15%, CI for the difference, 0.03% to 1.37%, P = 0.04). In period 2, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were lower and parathyroid hormone levels were higher in the placebo than in the vitamin D group. Whole-body lean and fat tissue and bone mineral density varied during the year but did not change overall. CONCLUSIONS: At latitude 42 degrees, healthy postmenopausal women with vitamin D intakes of 100 IU daily can significantly reduce late wintertime bone loss and improve net bone density of the spine over one year by increasing their intake of vitamin D to 500 IU daily. A long-term benefit of preventing vitamin D insufficiency in the winter seems likely although it remains to be shown. Observed changes in bone as well as in fat and lean tissue appear to be related to season.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To review the incidence of reversible renal insufficiency in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis undergoing antihypertensive therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 73 patients in a long-term blood pressure control study that compared the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus conventional antihypertensive agents compared with placebo plus antihypertensive agents. SETTING: Hospital-based outpatient treatment center. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into group 1, which received enalapril plus conventional antihypertensives, and group 2, which received placebo plus conventional antihypertensives. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure and serum creatinine levels were measured, and imaging studies of the main renal arteries were done. MAIN RESULTS: In group 1, eight of 42 patients (19%, 95% CI, 9% to 34%) developed reversible renal insufficiency, defined as an unexpected increase in serum creatinine of 88 mumol/L or higher. Six episodes of reversible renal insufficiency occurred during July and August when temperatures were 32.2 degrees C to 37.8 degrees C (90 degrees F to 100 degrees F). Renal artery stenosis was excluded by renal arteriogram or ultrasonic duplex scanning. All eight group-1 patients had a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure below their baseline level during reversible renal insufficiency (mean change, -28 +/- 10 mm Hg, P less than 0.001). The increase in the serum creatinine level was inversely correlated with the decrease in the mean arterial pressure (r = -0.68, P less than 0.01). Reversible renal insufficiency was successfully managed by withdrawing or reducing enalapril as well as other antihypertensive agents. Subsequently, enalapril was tolerated by seven of the eight patients without recurrence of renal insufficiency. In contrast, none of 31 (CI, 0% to 11%) patients in group 2 developed reversible renal insufficiency despite the fact that both the incidence of decreases in mean arterial pressure in 6 of 31 patients (19%) and the magnitude of the decreases in mean arterial pressure (mean change, -33 +/- 16 mm Hg) were similar to those observed in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Reversible renal insufficiency in hypertensive nephrosclerosis associated with ACE inhibitor therapy correlates with relative hypotension, is not dependent on renal artery stenosis, and can usually be managed by dose reduction.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of three commercial enzyme immunoassays in detecting and subtyping antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Referral medical center. PATIENTS: Ninety patients with culture-positive lesions caused by infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. The results of Western blot and glycoprotein G immunodot enzyme assays showed that an additional 53 patients had subclinical herpes simplex virus 2 infection, that another 20 patients had subclinical herpes simplex virus type 1 infection, and that 23 patients were seronegative. MEASUREMENTS: Three commercial enzyme immunoassays were used to determine herpes simplex virus antibody subtypes. MAIN RESULTS: All three commercial assays performed poorly in all patient groups (except in patients who were seronegative for herpes simplex virus). Among the 40 patients with a first episode of genital herpes, seroconversion to the appropriate viral type was shown by the three assays in only 33%, 55%, and 75% of cases. Among patients with recurrent genital herpes, the three commercial assays identified more than 90% of patients with only herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies but failed to identify herpes simplex virus type 2 infections in 58% to 76% of patients with antibodies to both virus subtypes. The three assays correctly identified only 55%, 75%, and 85% of the 53 \"silent carriers\" of herpes simplex virus type 2. Overall, the three enzyme immunoassays detected herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies in 60%, 62%, and 93% of patients with subtype 2 infections and falsely detected type 2 antibodies in 8%, 27%, and 49% of patients with type 1 infections. CONCLUSION: Currently licensed enzyme immunoassays give inaccurate or misleading results about the correct herpes simplex virus infecting subtype.\r"

PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with acromegaly were consecutively referred: 33 patients were referred because of clinical suspicion of sleep apnea and 20 patients were referred without suspected apnea. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep studies as well as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) measurements were done. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (93%; 95% Cl, 85% to 100%) referred because of suspicion of sleep apnea had sleep apnea compared with 12 patients (60%; Cl, 37% to 83%) referred without suspected sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea did not have biochemical evidence of increased disease activity (random growth hormone, 12.7 +/- 4.4 micrograms/L; mean growth hormone at 24-hour sampling, 10.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/L; IGF-1, 90.0 +/- 7.5 nmol/L) compared with patients without sleep apnea (random growth hormone, 14.2 +/- 4.9 micrograms/L, P greater than 0.2; mean growth hormone, 12.4 +/- 3.5 micrograms/L, P greater than 0.2; IGF-1, 90.0 +/- 10.0 nmol/L, P greater than 0.2). Central sleep apnea was the predominant type of apnea in 33% (Cl, 18% to 47%) of patients and was associated with higher random growth hormone and IGF-1 levels than was obstructive apnea (random growth hormone, 23.4 +/- 3.9 compared with 8.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/L, P less than 0.001; IGF-1, 126 +/- 17.5 compared with 72.5 +/- 7.5 nmol/L, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is common in acromegaly. The rate of central sleep apnea was unexpectedly high in patients with acromegaly, and biochemical evidence of increased disease activity was associated with the presence of central apnea rather than with the degree of sleep apnea. Altered respiratory control is a possible mechanism producing sleep apnea in acromegaly.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To study how changes in gastric acidity induced by omeprazole and pentagastrin affect the absorption of unchanged digoxin and its hydrolytic breakdown products. DESIGN: Double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, crossover study. SETTING: Academic department of clinical pharmacology. SUBJECTS: Six healthy male volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received digoxin, 1 mg orally, on three separate occasions: first, after pretreatment with omeprazole; second, after pretreatment with pentagastrin; and third, after \"pretreatment\" with placebo. MEASUREMENTS: The in-vitro decomposition of digoxin wa studied using a standard dissolution test. The urinary excretion of digoxin over a 120-hour period was measured using selective high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a polarization enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Plasma concentrations were measured at 2 hours with the EIA. MAIN RESULTS: Digoxin was rapidly released from the tablets in the in-vitro test. At acid pH, decomposition (as measured with HPLC) was rapid. Pentagastrin reduced the urinary excretion of unchanged digoxin, as measured by HPLC, from 34% to 21.4% of the dose (difference, -12.6%; 95% Cl, -23.5 to -1.8; P less than 0.05), whereas omeprazole increased urinary excretion to 47.4% (difference, 13.4%; 95 Cl, 2.5% to 24.4%; P less than 0.05). However, such differences were not found with the nonselective polarization EIA. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that gastric acidity causes the breakdown of digoxin to products that cross-react in the assay (EIA) that is commonly used clinically. In patients with reduced gastric acidity, increased plasma concentrations of unchanged digoxin may not be detected because of limitations of the EIA, which may invalidate the quantitative use of the plasma digoxin concentration as a predictor of digoxin toxicity. Omeprazole, and presumably other gastric-acid inhibitors, may increase the bioavailability of unchanged digoxin.\r"

Both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the induction and in the perpetuation of lupus. Implicated environmental triggers include ultraviolet light, chemicals (hydrazines, hair dyes, drugs), some foods, and possibly infectious agents. Lupus is mediated by the immune system. Patients have excess numbers of antibody-forming cells, including those that produce antibodies reactive with self-antigens. Patients also have an increased number of activated T cells, some of which help B cells to produce autoantibodies. A loss of tolerance is a critical immune abnormality in lupus; many of the activated helper T cells may result from a failure in normal tolerance mechanisms. A hematopoietic stem-cell defect could give rise to both B- and T-cell abnormalities. Such a stem-cell abnormality might lead to both a loss of self-tolerance and polyclonal B-cell activation. Antigen-driven, T-cell-dependent expansion of B-cell clones would then give rise to pathogenic autoantibodies, including anti-DNA. We believe that lupus is a syndrome: Patients differ regarding specific inciting factors and immune defects. Some patients have genetically conditioned abnormalities, similar to those found in mice with lupus; others have a combination of genetic and acquired defects. We hope that insights into pathogenesis lead to improved and more individualized therapy.\r"

To learn whether similar laws exist for patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias, we surveyed the Departments of Motor Vehicles in all 50 states. In addition, either an arrhythmia specialist (n = 25) or a general cardiologist (n = 25) was chosen randomly from each state and interviewed to study physician awareness of such laws and physician attitudes toward driving by patients with arrhythmias. Forty-two states (84%) have laws restricting driving by patients who have seizures; only 8 states (16%) have specific laws for patients with arrhythmias. No state makes a distinction between driving by patients with arrhythmias who are managed with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) compared with patients who are managed medically. Seventy-four percent of physicians did not know their own state's laws about driving by patients who have ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiologists were more likely to advise no driving restriction for medically treated patients than for ICD-treated patients. Cardiologists were also more likely to advise permanent restriction for patients with ICDs than for patients treated medically. We conclude that greater legal and medical consensus is needed to guide physicians in advising patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias about driving restrictions.\r"
