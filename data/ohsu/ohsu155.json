Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in approximately one-third of affected children. We evaluated the imaging studies performed in five children with this disorder. Pathologic examination of all five of the livers revealed cirrhosis and multiple regenerating nodules; hepatocellular carcinoma was present in two of the five livers. All five patients had high-attenuation or high- and low-attenuation foci within the liver. These high-attenuation foci were not apparent as focal lesions in three of four hepatic sonograms or in one of two hepatic nuclear scans. Angiography showed tumor vascularity in one patient with a focal hepatocellular carcinoma, but was indeterminate in a second patient with severe cirrhosis and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. Children with cirrhosis due to tyrosinemia may develop regenerating nodules that appear as high-attenuation hepatic foci on CT scans. It is difficult to differentiate regenerating nodules from multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the prenatal sonographic findings of anorectal atresia (ARA), we retrospectively reviewed 12 proven cases. Sonography showed abnormally dilated bowel segments in five cases (42%), four of which were identified prospectively; at autopsy, two other cases showed mild colon dilatation not evident on sonograms. Bowel dilatation was not associated with the location of atresia or the presence of a fistula, but was possibly related to menstrual age. Eleven fetuses (92%) had significant other anomalies primarily related to the VACTERL syndrome (vertebral defects, anal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, radial and renal dysplasia, and limb malformations) and/or the caudal regression syndrome; of these, sonography identified one or more concurrent anomalies in seven cases. In two cases, bowel dilatation was the primary sonographic finding. Death in nine cases resulted from termination of pregnancy (four cases) or perinatal demise (five cases); three patients are still alive. We conclude that some cases of ARA can be suspected on prenatal sonograms by demonstration of dilated colon, and that the sensitivity of this finding may be related to menstrual age at the time of the examination. Distinguishing ARA from other causes of fetal-bowel dilatation is important because of the frequency of concurrent anomalies associated with ARA.\r"

Flow through the tubes was imaged at 2 to 12 cm and 2 to 18 cm distances from the transducer, by the use of the near and far focus settings of the instrument. First, the color flow diameters were compared to the known internal diameters of the tubing oriented at a 30- to 70-degree flow angle to the direction of interrogation to test axial resolution as well as lateral resolution. For the near transmit focus setting, the color diameters increasingly overestimated the actual flow diameters as the distance from the transducer increased progressively beyond 6 cm (i.e., overestimation of up to 25 mm or 500% for the 4.8 mm tubing and 250% for the 9.5 mm tubing at 16 cm from the transducer). For the far transmit focus setting and for distances within 10 cm, the color diameters did not differ significantly (i.e., more than 1 mm) from the actual diameter. The lowest velocity color encoded by the instrument was 3 cm/sec for a pulse repetition frequency of 4 kHz. At a flow velocity of about 50 cm/sec, 6 cm distance from the transducer and mid gain settings, flow through the 1.6 mm tube barely color coded, while flow through 2.4, 3.2, and 4.8 mm tubes was easily imaged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We therefore evaluated the effects of a 48-hour infusion of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) in patients with anterior infarctions. Seventeen patients were randomized to receive intravenous GIK (n = 10) or placebo (n = 7). All patients additionally received streptokinase. Changes in left ventricular function were assessed by comparing the global ejection fractions and the regional infarct area ejection fractions of the first ventriculogram with the 10-day second ventriculogram. There was a significantly greater improvement in the global ejection fraction of patients receiving GIK (increases 0.07 +/- 0.04) than in those randomized to placebo (decreases 0.08 +/- 0.04) (p less than 0.02). There was also a much greater improvement in the area ejection fractions of the group receiving GIK vs the group receiving placebo in the anterolateral (increases 0.24 +/- 0.07 vs decreases 0.02 +/- 0.04 [p less than 0.02]) and diaphragmatic (increases 0.08 +/- 0.08 vs decreases 0.17 +/- 0.05 [p less than 0.005]) segments. Thus in patients with anterior infarctions receiving streptokinase, GIK improves ventricular function and reduces the size of the segmental wall motion abnormality.\r"

High low-density lipoprotein is positively related to coronary heart disease, and high high-density lipoprotein is inversely related. Systolic or diastolic hypertension at any age in either sex contributes powerfully. The impact of diabetes is greater for women and varies with the number of accompanying risk factors. High-normal fibrinogen values further escalate risk of these atherogenic factors. An atherogenic life-style is typified by a diet excessive in fat, calories, and salt; sedentary habits; unrestrained weight gain; and cigarette smoking. Moderate alcohol use may be beneficial. Use of oral contraceptives beyond age 35 years and in conjunction with cigarette smoking predisposes one to thromboembolism. Type A behavior carries an increased risk, and men married to more highly educated women and to women in white-collar jobs are more vulnerable. Signs of preclinical ischemia include silent myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG, blocked intraventricular conduction, and repolarization abnormalities. Measures of innate susceptibility include a family history of early cardiovascular disease. Quantitative combination of risk factors provides optimal prediction, including persons with multiple marginal abnormalities. Preventive management should also be multifactorial and requires a commitment to behavior modification and alteration in life-style.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of antihypertensive drugs has been considerable over the last few decades. Hypertension-associated mortality and morbidity have decreased significantly following the introduction of potent and useful antihypertensive drugs. Against this background, it is disturbing that three recent large-scale studies have shown that morbidity and mortality in treated hypertensive patients are markedly higher than in comparable normotensive subjects. It is conceivable that these findings can be explained to some extent by the fact that the elevated arterial pressure quite frequently is not lowered to strictly normotensive levels. Another aspect of the impact of antihypertensive drugs is that they frequently affect the mood and well-being of the patient. In the early days of antihypertensive therapy, the interference of drugs with the quality of life was considerable. With the drugs available today, negative effects on well-being are much rarer, although still extant. Thus, there is still room for improvement of antihypertensive drugs both in this respect and, more importantly, in achieving a further lowering of hypertension-induced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The conventional \"stepped-care\" approach to the treatment of hypertension deserves revision. Rational therapy considers a variety of factors to obtain maximum efficacy, safety, tolerability, compliance, and neutralization of neural tone for the prevention of sudden death. The patient's age, gender, race, behavior profile, hemodynamic and neurohumoral status (plasma renin activity, norepinephrine/epinephrine ratio), and quality of life will help determine the choice of antihypertensive agent. Concomitant risk factors (smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia), the presence of sequelae (left ventricular hypertrophy and/or failure, renal failure), and the existence of other disorders (mitral valve prolapse, depression, anxiety) must also be considered when initiating treatment. In addition, the cost of ancillary expenses (laboratory tests, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits) must be weighed against the potential benefits of therapy. Beta blockers are effective, well tolerated, and versatile for the treatment of concomitant cardiovascular disorders and as behavior modifiers. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors also show promise and merit consideration as therapy for specific groups of hypertensive patients.\r"

These various factors reduce enjoyment of life, but their components and interrelationships are difficult to measure in the individual. There is no consensus on the best methods of measurement of quality of life; many general instruments have been proposed but none that specifically concern angina pectoris. Despite the absence of such quantitative information, there is no doubt that antianginal drugs benefit the majority of patients and, despite their side effects, advantageously change the relationship between the factors that add up to \"quality of life.\" How the relief of symptoms, both organic and psychologic, interact and how far they are offset by the negative aspects of treatment in the patient with angina pectoris remain to be defined. Past and present trials give encouragement that instruments will be developed that are relevant, valid, reproducible, and sufficiently sensitive to convincingly measure the different impacts on quality of life of the patient with angina pectoris.\r"

Although the immediate preservation of life is the first priority, the relief of symptoms and anxiety and the protection of the myocardium are of short- and long-term importance not only to the quantity but also to the quality of life. Pain relief, particularly in the prehospital phase, is often inadequate. Fear, triggered by pain, may be aggravated by the environment; aggressive (and often unnecessary) measures and the inhuman use of technology may interfere with personal care. Intensive observation is essential for the control of dangerous arrhythmias; the early use of fibrinolytic agents and beta blockers limits the extent of myocardial damage and reduces mortality. The effectiveness of therapy for cardiac failure and shock is questionable. The value of invasive monitoring and of inotropic drugs is uncertain, although the relief of symptoms by diuretic agents and vasodilator drugs is not in doubt. Success in the management of myocardial infarction depends on a highly individualized approach.\r"

  ".W": "The value of beta blockade after myocardial infarction is extremely well documented. Close to 50 randomized trials have been performed, involving about 40,000 patients with short- or long-term follow-up. Over 20,000 patients have been included in more than 20 placebo-controlled trials with a follow-up period of 3 months or more. In long-term follow-up studies, about 1 to 2 weeks to 1 year after myocardial infarction, mortality was reduced by 21% and reinfarction by 24% (about 20,000 patients in 24 trials). The trial medication was withdrawn in about 20% in both placebo and beta-blocker groups in the major trials. In addition to reduction of mortality and reinfarction rate, benefits have clearly been demonstrated on severity of chest pain, arrhythmias, and other thromboatherosclerotic complications, as well as on readmissions. Significantly more patients experienced congestive heart failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cold hands with beta-blocker treatment, whereas no clear-cut difference was found for atrioventricular block, bronchial constriction, and intermittent claudication. Some studies have reported more tiredness, depression, and gastrointestinal disturbances. In the Stockholm metoprolol trial, analyses on quality of life have been performed. In this trial, 3 years of metoprolol treatment after myocardial infarction resulted in a prolongation of both survival and time spent completely asymptomatic, as well as in an optimal functional state. Furthermore, less time was spent disabled after serious atherosclerotic complications. Long-term beta blockade after myocardial infarction reduces mortality and morbidity but causes adverse reactions in some patients. With proper selection of patients and type and dosage of beta blocker, survival without atherosclerotic complications and side effects can be prolonged.\r"

  ".W": "Advantages and disadvantages of the various therapies for stable angina are considered with particular attention to quality of life. Advantages of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS), apart from the question of survival, include less angina, less activity limitation, and less need for drugs than with medical treatment. However, data from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) and others show that there is no difference between medical and surgical therapy in return to work and in need for subsequent hospitalization. In CABS patients, there is also predictable return of angina, substantial late vein graft occlusion, and possibly increased progression of native coronary artery disease in grafted vessels. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has advantages similar to those of CABS, with very low initial mortality and major complication rates, minimal discomfort, very short disability period, and moderate cost. Its major disadvantages are a high short-term reocclusion rate and uncertain long-term outcome. Beta blockers provide good control of angina, have additional antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic effects, and may be beneficial in preventing sudden cardiac (arrhythmic) death and limiting myocardial infarct size, should these events supervene in the patient with angina. Disadvantages of beta blockers involve the occasional major side effects, including potential exacerbation of bronchospasm, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes, congestive heart failure and bradyarrhythmia, and frequent \"nuisance\" side effects. Calcium blockers control both exercise and rest angina and pose no problem in patients with bronchoconstriction, PVD, or diabetes. Disadvantages include need for frequent dosage, cost, and side effects. Long-acting nitrates have few major side effects and usually transient minor side effects, with little effect on quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute studies in patients with effort angina suggest a very favorable hemodynamic profile characterized by coronary vasodilatation and reduction in determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. Both open and controlled trials in patients with effort angina show that long-term oral administration increases exercise time and time to onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression and decreases angina frequency. With treatment for up to 6 months, antiischemic effects were maintained without serious adverse reactions. Other studies indicate that nicardipine is generally comparable to propranolol and nifedipine in prolonging exercise time and time to onset of ST-segment depression. Nicardipine, however, does not depress heart rate at rest, and maximal exercise workload is higher with nicardipine than with either placebo or propranolol. In a controlled study of patients with angina at rest due to coronary spasm, nicardipine decreased angina frequency and nitroglycerin consumption by approximately 80%. Episodes of symptomatic and asymptomatic ST-segment shift, as recorded by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, showed a trend to decrease in number. Nicardipine appeared similarly effective in patients with coronary spasm superimposed on significant coronary disease and with spasm in the absence of significant coronary disease. Nicardipine appears to be safe and effective in the management of patients with angina pectoris.\r"

  ".W": "Nicardipine has been shown to lower blood pressure in patients with uncomplicated hypertension as well as in patients with concomitant renal impairment, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. The decrease in blood pressure induced by nicardipine is related to a concurrent decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance. The antihypertensive actions of nicardipine are maintained during long-term administration without the development of tachyphylaxis. In patients receiving diuretics or beta blockers, the addition of nicardipine has been shown to produce an additional decrease in blood pressure. The combined use of nicardipine and beta blockers may be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension: the increase in peripheral vascular resistance during beta blockade may be prevented by nicardipine-induced vasodilation; conversely, beta blockers may prevent reflex tachycardia and other consequences of peripheral vasodilatation. Although nicardipine may increase the heart rate acutely, tachycardia does not occur during long-term therapy. Preliminary data suggest that nicardipine exerts potent antihypertensive effects in patients with renal insufficiency without altering renal parameters. In patients with normal renal function, nicardipine has been shown to cause acute natriuresis and an increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Nicardipine also has a favorable effect on peripheral and cerebral blood flow. Like other dihydropyridines, nicardipine appears to have an antiatherogenetic effect in the experimental model. Short-term therapy with nicardipine does not affect serum lipid levels. Results from several studies suggest that nicardipine is an effective antihypertensive agent that can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs such as beta blockers or diuretics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nicardipine has high affinity for the dihydropyridine-binding site and has been shown to inhibit the influx of extracellular calcium through membrane slow channels. The calcium antagonist activity of nicardipine is greater in vascular smooth muscle than in cardiac muscle. Nicardipine has also been shown to possess greater activity in coronary than in peripheral vascular smooth muscle. This in vitro profile accounts for the decreased blood pressure and increased coronary blood flow in animal models in vivo. These pharmacologic properties are the basis for nicardipine's clinical utility in essential hypertension and acute myocardial ischemia. Nicardipine has been shown to be more vascular selective than other calcium antagonists and, therefore, possibly less inclined to produce negative inotropicity. This latter property has been confirmed in human hemodynamic studies. Nicardipine is effective in models of acute myocardial ischemia and hypertension. These results have been confirmed in antianginal and antihypertensive studies in humans. This new calcium antagonist has been shown to limit myocardial infarct size in both dogs and baboons subject to left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and to reduce the extent of ischemia-induced cerebral neuronal death in rats. Other protective effects of nicardipine have been demonstrated in paracetamol overdose in mice, chloroform-induced hepatotoxicity in rats and cerebral ischemia in gerbils and baboons. The mechanism of this cell protection of nicardipine may be related to physicochemical effects.\r"

Over 2,000 patients have received nicardipine, most at dosages of 20 to 40 mg 3 times daily. In 12 double-blind, parallel-group studies (4 of them placebo-controlled) the efficacy of nicardipine was evaluated in mild to moderate hypertension; supine systolic blood pressure was lowered by 10 to 15 mm Hg and supine diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg. A clear dose response is present at dosages from 10 to 40 mg 3 times daily. Patients with angina were treated in 9 double-blind, crossover design studies: 4 of these were placebo-controlled; 3 were comparison studies with beta blockers; 2 were comparisons with nifedipine. Treadmill exercise tests were the major measure of efficacy. Results of these studies showed consistent, statistically significant improvement in exercise tolerance and time to onset of angina, and clinical improvement in patients with chronic stable angina. The effective dosages of nicardipine were 30 or 40 mg 3 times daily. A placebo-controlled study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in patients with vasospastic angina. No deaths or serious adverse reactions were attributed to nicardipine during clinical trials. The most common side effects reported were flushing, palpitations, headache and pedal edema. These appeared to be due to the drug's pharmacologic property of vasodilatation.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium antagonists influence cardiovascular hemodynamics by 3 actions: peripheral arterial dilatation, coronary arterial dilatation and negative inotropic effect. The net hemodynamic effects vary depending on the relative strength of each action. Intravenous administration of the new compound nicardipine, a dihydropyridine derivative with calcium antagonist activity that is chemically related to nifedipine, induced a marked reduction of systemic vascular resistance in patients with and without beta blockade. This was accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, end-diastolic pressure, peak (+) dP/dt and dP/dt measured at a developed pressure of 40 mm Hg and normalized for this pressure remained unchanged. The time constant of isovolumetric pressure drop during the first 40 ms also decreased. Intravenous administration of nicardipine prevented a marked increase in end-diastolic pressure during exercise, and augmented left ventricular ejection fraction in chronic heart failure. At doses producing similar increases in coronary sinus blood flow, intracoronary administration of nicardipine, unlike nifedipine, has little effect on left ventricular contractility and end-diastolic pressure. Nicardipine is a powerful systemic vasodilator with minimal effects on myocardial inotropic state, even in patients with compromised left ventricular function and patients receiving beta blocker therapy.\r"

Although a reduction in blood pressure (BP) often results in regression of hypertrophy, the pharmacologic profiles of the antihypertensive agents used may determine the probability of such regression despite similar levels of BP reduction. Thiazide diuretic drugs may actually result in increased LV hypertrophy; calcium channel antagonists may cause regression or no change. The effects of treatment with nitrendipine (20 mg/day) or hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day) were compared in an 8-week, double-blind study of 18 hypertensive subjects aged 50 years or older. BP was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) by both nitrendipine (from 161 +/- 29/102 +/- 4 to 145 +/- 24/92 +/- 7 mm Hg; mean +/- standard deviation) and hydrochlorothiazide (from 162 +/- 15/105 +/- 6 to 143 +/- 20/95 +/- 7 mm Hg).

  ".W": "Since sodium and water retention have been implicated as major factors limiting maximal metabolic vasodilation in congestive heart failure (CHF), the effect of rigorous diuresis on maximal vasodilatory capacity was studied systematically in 9 subjects hospitalized with decompensated CHF. Peak reactive hyperemic blood flow, measured by strain-gauge plethysmography, was used as an index of maximal vasodilatory capacity. After 24 hours of diuresis and a 2.2-kg weight loss, maximal flow increased from 19.9 to 26.1 ml/min X 100 ml (p less than 0.05). Despite a further 1.4-kg weight loss between 24 and 48 hours, maximal blood flow increased no more (26.1 to 25.8 ml/min X 100 ml). Since blood pressure did not change significantly, minimal forearm resistance and maximal conductance showed similar improvements. It is unlikely that vasoconstrictor hormone changes could account for this effect since a marked decrease in plasma norepinephrine occurred in only 2 of 8 subjects and plasma renin activity decreased in only 1 subject. As a group there was no significant change in norepinephrine level, which remained substantially above normal (1,525 to 1,148 pg/ml), or in plasma renin activity (12.3 to 18.9 ng/ml/hour). Because the improvement in vasodilator capacity reached a plateau by 24 hours despite continued diuresis, and because peak reactive hyperemic blood flow was still 32% below normal, it is suggested that a second mechanism besides sodium and water retention is responsible for a significant portion of the impaired peripheral vasodilation in CHF.\r"

Sixteen patients underwent Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiography after orthotopic transplantation. Mitral regurgitation was present in 14 of 16 patients. Left atrial geometry was uniformly abnormal, in a \"snowman\" configuration. Compared with 16 normal control subjects, the transplanted left atria were dilated (23 +/- 6 vs 13 +/- 3 cm2 during ventricular systole, p less than 0.001). Mitral valve anular diameter indexes, anular systolic reduction and ventricular function were normal in both groups. Ventricular volumes were small in the transplanted heart relative to donor body size (15 +/- 5 vs 20 +/- 8 cm3/m2 in systole, p less than 0.05). The ratio between ventricular length and anular diameter was smaller in the transplant patients (0.87 +/- 0.1 vs 1.0 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.05). In the presence of abnormal left atria, mitral regurgitation may occur without other structural abnormalities of the mitral apparatus. This study suggests that the left atrium plays an important role in mitral valve competence for primary cardiac disease associated with left atrial enlargement, even in the absence of intrinsic mitral valve disease or left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

In the 19 transplant patients imaged within 24 days of graft implantation, only 1 had evidence of graft rejection on biopsy.

Analysis of 13 consecutively acquired biplane digital subtraction angiograms before and after PTCA was undertaken to determine intra- and interobserver variability of absolute lesion diameter, relative videodensitometric cross-sectional area, automated percent diameter stenosis and visual percent diameter stenosis using a new fully automated quantitative computer program. The reliability of single-view measurements was also assessed. Both before and after PTCA, measures of absolute diameter showed less interobserver variability than densitometry, percent automated diameter stenosis and percent visual diameter stenosis measurements (before, r = 0.95, 0.83, 0.86, 0.70; after, 0.95, 0.88, 0.81, 0.62, respectively). Relative videodensitometric cross-sectional area correlated poorly with images from the orthogonal view (r = 0.46). These data suggest that quantitative angiography reduces variability from visual estimates; of all quantitative angiographic measurements, the highest interobserver reproducibility is achieved using absolute lesion diameter both before and after PTCA, probably because no operator interaction is needed to identify a \"normal\" segment. Unselected, single-view quantitative arteriography is poorly reproducible using videodensitometry. Therefore, automated determination of absolute lesion diameter in at least 2 projections provides the most reproducible evaluation of coronary lesions both before and after PTCA.\r"

This study evaluated these alterations using digital subtraction angiography. Coronary flow reserve was determined before and after successful PTCA in 20 patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Ten other patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries, normal exercise electrocardiographic responses and normal cardiac structure also were evaluated. Coronary flow reserve was calculated as the ratio of papavarine-induced hyperemic flow to basal flow. Flow reserve for the stenotic artery in patients who underwent PTCA was 1.6 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (range 0.9 to 3.9, n = 20). After successful PTCA, flow reserve for this artery increased to 3.1 +/- 0.2 (range 1.7 to 5.2, n = 20) (p less than 0.0001 vs before PTCA). Flow reserve for adjacent nonstenotic, nondilated arteries was 2.6 +/- 0.2 (range 1.4 to 4.5, n = 13). Coronary flow reserve in the stenotic arteries before PTCA was far below normal. In addition, both successfully dilated arteries and nondilated, nonstenotic arteries in these patients with CAD had flow reserve values smaller than those in the patients with normal arteries (4.8 +/- 0.6, range 2.3 to 12.6, n =22) (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that digital angiographic determinations of coronary flow reserve can reveal important alterations of individual artery vasodilatory capacity. The data suggest that although an epicardial coronary in a patient with CAD may appear angiographically normal, flow reserve remains impaired due to abnormalities as yet undefined.\r"

Comparisons were made with HR variability findings in 20 normal volunteers. Sudden death was due to ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation in all cases. Both early (3 patients) and late cycle (2 patients) ventricular premature complexes initiated the terminal dysrhythmia. An increased density of ventricular ectopic activity was noted in the hour before onset of ventricular fibrillation. HR variability as measured by the standard deviation was significantly (p less than 0.01) lower in the patients who died suddenly (30 +/- 10 ms) than in the normal subjects (76 +/- 14 ms). These findings support suggestions that HR variability analysis may be useful in identifying patients at a higher risk of sudden death.\r"

No significant differences in diastolic BP, heart rate or side effects occurred. After the ISDN tapering off-period (2 weeks), systolic BP increased significantly but did not change with placebo.

We used 2.5 and 4.25% glucose and 1.1 and 2.0% amino acid dialysates to assess short-term effectiveness and nutritional consequences of amino acid-based dialysis solutions. Plasma and effluent urea and creatinine concentrations were similar with amino acid and glucose dialysis although 16% less fluid was removed with amino acid dialysates. Absorption of 77.3 +/- 5.3% of dialysate amino acids exceeded losses of amino acids and protein in glucose effluent. With amino acid dialysates, fasting plasma glucose concentrations were maintained while plasma amino acid levels rose, peaked at 1 h, and, excepting methionine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine with the 2.0% solution, returned to initial levels after 5 h. Compared with glucose, amino acid dialysates provide reduced but satisfactory fluid and waste removal, maintain normoglycemia, and more than compensate for effluent losses of amino acids and protein.\r"

Obese women had more adipose tissue than did obese men from the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness. It is suggested that augmentation in plasma branched-chain keto acids in obesity may reflect insulin resistance and that the apparent differences observed between obese women and men may be due to differences in body composition.\r"

During the middle month, low-GI foods were substituted for those with a higher GI with minimal change in dietary macronutrient and fiber content. Only in the group (24 patients) with raised triglyceride levels (types IIb, III, and IV) were significant lipid reductions seen: total cholesterol 8.8 +/- 1.5% (p less than 0.001), LDL cholesterol 9.1 +/- 2.4% (p less than 0.001), and serum triglyceride 19.3 +/- 3.2% (p less than 0.001) with no change in HDL cholesterol. The percentage reduction in serum triglyceride related to the initial triglyceride levels (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01). The small weight loss (0.4 kg) on the low-GI diet did not relate to the lipid changes. Low-GI diets may be of use in the management of lipid abnormalities associated with hypertriglyceridemia.\r"

Better analyses of the composition of human milk are likely to lead to an improved understanding of the infant's nutritional requirements and thus to better feeding practices.\r"

Breast-feeding is less common among lower income than among higher income groups. In 1985 10% of infants aged 6 mo were fed fresh fluid cow milk--down from 70% in 1971. Most formula-fed infants receive iron-fortified formulas (12 mg Fe/L). Beikost is now commonly fed to infants less than age 2 mo. The Infant Formula Act of 1980 resulted in promulgation of new quality control and labelling requirements for infant formulas. Over the past 15 y, salt and sugar concentrations of commercially prepared beikost items have been decreased, and certain modified food starches are no longer used. There is considerable doubt about the bioavailability of the electrolytic iron powder used to fortify most of the dry infant cereals.\r"

In the 1940s Filer and others demonstrated that vitamin E protects tissue unsaturated fatty acids against oxidation. The 1940s and the 1950s marked the beginning of interest in the role of vitamin E in infant nutrition. During this period, investigators examined the intestinal absorption of vitamin E in infants and its use for the prevention of hemolysis, retrolental fibroplasia, intracranial hemorrhage, and pulmonary oxygen toxicity. These studies were the forerunners of more recent studies examining possible benefits of vitamin E therapy in premature infants. Recent studies confirmed earlier reports indicating that enteral administration of vitamin E is the safest and most effective route in infants. Although preventing vitamin E deficiency is clearly necessary, neither earlier nor more recent work has shown any benefit from high-dose vitamin E therapy (greater than 20 IU X kg-1 X d-1) for premature infants.\r"

  ".W": "The human infant is born with low body stores of vitamin E. Thus, the infant requires an adequate intake of vitamin E soon after birth. If adequate sources of tocopherol are not provided, a clearly defined deficiency state characterized by hemolytic anemia and, after a period of years, spinocerebellar degeneration results. However, the benefit of pharmacologic doses of vitamin E given as prophylaxis against diseases believed to be related to oxygen toxicity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage) is not clear. Possible benefits must be balanced against the potential for serious toxicity. Few data are available on the pharmacokinetics of tocopherols in infants, particularly with respect to esterified forms of tocopherol, and little is known about the toxicity associated with parenteral administration of the vitamin.\r"

Since 1920 the use of legally sanctioned food additives has become common. However, for the last several decades the regulation of food additives has been a matter of controversy. Explanations for this controversy, which is likely to continue, are not difficult to identify and are discussed in the text.\r"

The critical question is whether aspartame ingestion is potentially harmful to humans at normal use and potential abuse levels. This paper reviews clinical studies testing the effects of various doses of aspartame upon blood levels of aspartate, phenylalanine, and methanol. These studies demonstrate that blood levels of these compounds are well below levels associated with adverse effects in sensitive animal species.\r"

Comparison with SCCs from a control group showed no clearcut differences with respect to level of invasion, grade, pattern, or presence of actinic change. Most of these lesions were found in sun-exposed areas, were associated with actinic changes, and with actinic keratoses.

More recently, however, several reports have suggested that TdT-positive blast cells may be found in a substantial number of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, a sensitive immunoalkaline phosphatase procedure (the APAAP technic) has been used to stain normal and neoplastic blood and bone marrow samples for TdT with the use of both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-TdT antibodies. As expected, most cases of ALL studied (63 of 65) were TdT-positive. In addition, however, blast cells in 22 out of 59 (37%) cases of AML were stained by anti-TdT antibodies. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization were seen in each type of acute leukemia. These findings, together with previous immunocytochemical and biochemical studies, suggest that a substantial number of cases of AML express TdT (usually in a minority of blast cells) and that the frequency with which these cases are detected is directly related to the sensitivity of the staining technic used.\r"

By contrast, normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and CLL cells were negative for S-100 protein. Additional studies were performed by immunoperoxidase technics on representative sections of formalin-fixed splenic tissues from eight patients who had splenectomies. The cause of splenectomy was HCL in three, traumatic rupture in one, CLL in one, Hodgkin's disease in one, and hypersplenism in two patients. Sections from all three HCL patients showed moderate to marked positivity with antisera to S-100 protein. These results strongly suggest the presence of S-100 protein in HCL cells.\r"

Six of the ANA+ sera had a diffuse pattern, six had a peripheral pattern, three had a combined diffuse and rim pattern, and one had a diffuse and nucleolar pattern. Seven of the ANA+ sera were positive at a 1:40 titer, one at a 1:80 titer, four at a 1:160 titer, two at a 1:320 titer, and two at a 1:640 titer. Thirteen of the 32 ANA- patients have died, at intervals of one month to four years after transplantation. Fourteen of the 16 ANA+ patients have died, at intervals ranging from less than one day to four years after transplantation. The mean time period from transplantation to death was 13 +/- 15 months for the ANA+ patients: these were not statistically significantly different. However, the mean interval from transplantation to death of the ANA+ patients with an ANA titer greater than 1:40 was 0.8 +/- 0.8 months, which was significantly different from the mean survival period of the ANA+ group as a whole (P less than or equal to 0.05) and the mean survival of the ANA- group (P less than or equal to 0.005). Although the mechanism is not clear, there appears to be an association between higher titer serum ANA positivity and increased mortality in patients with cardiac transplants with significantly decreased duration of survival after transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of oral testosterone treatment (200 mg tid) on liver morphology was examined in a double-blind, placebo controlled study including men with alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 126). Liver biopsies obtained before randomization showed micronodular cirrhosis in 119 patients (94%), alcoholic hepatitis in 64 (51%), and fatty liver in 104 (83%). These and other morphological findings did not differ significantly in the patients randomized to testosterone (n = 76) and to placebo (n = 50) (skewed randomization 3:2). Follow-up liver specimens (biopsies or autopsies) obtained after a median treatment duration of 30 months demonstrated a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in the prevalence of macronodular cirrhosis (from 6 to 51%) and a significant (p less than 0.01) decrease in the prevalence of alcoholic hepatitis (to 21%) and of fatty liver (to 52%). Testosterone treatment did not significantly influence the prevalence of these changes. Further, testosterone treatment had no significant effect on the prevalence of other morphological changes, including vascular and malignant changes. However, in the testosterone-treated group one patient developed diffuse sinusoidal dilation and one patient showed Budd-Chiari's syndrome. The degree of fatty liver and of alcoholic hepatitis in follow-up liver specimens were significantly (p less than 0.002) higher among patients who consumed ethanol during follow-up than in patients who abstained (76 versus 22% and 30 versus 6%). In conclusion, this study does not establish any indication or any contraindication in terms of hepatic histopathology with the possible exception of hepatic venous thrombosis for the use of oral testosterone treatment in men with alcoholic cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects on liver function tests of liver-directed radiation (RT) and systemic chemotherapy (CT) were examined at 6 months after initiation of treatment on two Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group protocols. Data from patients on protocol GI 6175 (adjuvant CT or no adjuvant therapy) were used to evaluate the effect of CT alone, and data from patients on protocol GI 6179 (adjuvant CT plus liver directed RT or no adjuvant therapy) were used to evaluate the combined effects of CT and RT. Finally, data from patients on GI 6179 who received less than protocol specified RT doses were used to determine whether minor differences in dose are detectable via liver function tests. In 40 patients receiving CT, the serum level of alkaline phosphatase was not significantly increased (p = 0.14) compared to that of control patients whereas the level of serum glutamate oxoloacetate transaminase was significantly elevated (p = 0.03). In 31 patients receiving both CT and RT, both alkaline phosphatase and SGOT were significantly elevated (both p = 0.03). In addition, in 19 patients who received less than full RT doses, the changes in dose were not detectable from those patients who received full dose (all p greater than 0.10). In summary, CT alone may elevate hepatocellular enzymes, whereas a combination of CT and liver-directed RT is associated with a significant increase in both SGOT and alkaline phosphatase. Small alterations in the dose of volume of RT are not detectable by liver function test variations.\r"

All patients were symptomatic outpatients without history of alcoholism or usage of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. After the initial diagnosis, the patients underwent follow-up endoscopy until healing of erosions at 1, 4, and 8 wk. Pairs of biopsies from the gastric fundus, body, and antrum, and the duodenum were obtained at each endoscopy. Agreement between histological and endoscopic findings occurred in only 56% of the 161 sites studied. The best correlation occurred in the duodenum when there was endoscopic disease (89%) and was worst in the stomach at all sites regardless of endoscopic findings (46%). A normal histology in the face of abnormal endoscopic changes was seen in only 16% of all biopsies. Histological inflammation occurred in 27% of all biopsies with a normal endoscopic appearance and in 55% of the normal endoscopic areas in the stomach. Histological appearances at each biopsy site remained constant in individual patients throughout the study. The specific histological findings, such as activity and severity, did not correlate with the endoscopic severity of inflammation or with any specific endoscopic appearances, such as erosions, petechiae, or nodules. In conclusion, the histological and endoscopic findings in the stomach from patients with symptomatic erosive gastroduodenitis correlate poorly while good correlation occurs in the duodenum.\r"

Therefore, we investigated 20 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients for ARCD using ultrasonography. Seven patients (35%) had detectable cysts and two patients (10%) had multiple bilateral cysts. One patient had a large asymptomatic complex cyst that proved to be an adenocarcinoma. Our study suggests that ARCD is relatively common in the PD population, and we speculate that it may be related more to length of time in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than to the mode of dialysis. The potential for malignant change appears to justify a routine screening examination with ultrasonography and/or computerized tomography (CT) to detect this recently described and probably underrecognized entity.\r"

The therapeutic benefit of immunosuppression and plasma exchange remains controversial. We described two patients with primary IgA nephropathy and rapidly progressive renal failure. Both patients showed extensive glomerulosclerosis and crescent formation in their renal biopsies. Corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy failed to control the progression of the disease, and plasma exchanges were performed. In both cases, the serum creatinine and creatinine clearance initially improved with plasma exchange and the rapid progression of renal failure was apparently halted. In one patient, the serum creatinine rose when treatment was discontinued and fell again when plasma exchange was recommenced. Nevertheless, the long-term benefit of plasma exchange in crescentic IgA nephropathy was unsatisfactory as the renal function continued to deteriorate in the following 12 months despite an initial stabilization.\r"

  ".U": "87267592\r", 
  ".W": "Evidence has accumulated that angiotensin II (AII) exerts multiple influences upon renal function through effects on vascular, glomerular, and tubular structures. Infusion of AII alters glomerular ultrafiltration by decreasing nephron plasma flow, increasing glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (PG) and the hydrostatic pressure gradient (delta P) due to increases in both afferent and efferent arteriolar vascular resistance, and effecting a reduction in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (LpA), the product of glomerular membrane hydraulic conductivity and effective surface area for ultrafiltration. Spontaneous increases in intrarenal AII generation, such as observed in chronic NaCl depletion, also produce reductions in nephron plasma flow, increases in delta P, and major reductions in LpA. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and saralasin administration prevent these alterations in plasma flow, delta P, and LpA. These AII-induced alterations in LpA may be mediated by AII effects upon the glomerular mesangial cell since AII receptors are expressed and this cell contracts in vitro in the presence of AII. Multiple studies have shown a positive effect of AII (approximately 10(-11) mol/L) on proximal tubular reabsorption, an effect independent of AII effects on peritubular physical factors. These AII effects upon the proximal tubule are clearly independent of interaction with adrenergic influences. AII also influences other mesangial cell functions such as uptake of macromolecules from the circulation. AII also exerts effects by influencing the functional expression of renal adrenergic activity, as demonstrated by studies with renal nerve stimulation in the presence and absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and saralasin. Inhibition of AII activity also clearly suppresses tubuloglomerular activity and the PG response to alterations in distal tubular flow rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between systemic arterial pressures, renal blood flow, filtration, and sodium homeostasis are complex. Considerable evidence has accrued indicating that changes in renal sodium handling as a function of perfusion pressure participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Central to this viewpoint is the normalization of BP after transplantation of a normal kidney to a hypertensive host, both in animals and humans. Renal blood flow varies inversely with the severity and duration of hypertension. Studies of regional hemodynamics underscore the importance of independent regulation of different vascular beds. Some observations suggest that abnormal renal vascular reactivity may be among the earliest changes in essential hypertension. The degree to which these represent structural changes as opposed to functional responses to endocrine or neurogenic stimuli may vary under different circumstances and merits further study. Although antihypertensive therapy generally has been well tolerated by the kidney, deterioration of renal function has been encountered during pharmacological BP reduction. In the presence of preglomerular arterial disease, blood flow and filtration may become sensitive to hemodynamic fluctuations, which leads to the designation of \"critical perfusion pressure.\" Awareness of the mechanisms by which changes in systemic hemodynamics impinge upon renal function may lead to more rational use of specific antihypertensive agents.\r"

  ".W": "Because the renin-angiotensin system frequently participates in sustaining severe forms of hypertension, early studies with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were concentrated in patients whose hypertension was refractory to previously available treatment. The effectiveness of captopril, both acutely and during long-term treatment, led to its widespread use for treatment-resistant hypertension. More recently, captopril's efficacy when used as monotherapy and its relative avoidance of symptomatic adverse effects have expanded its role to hypertension of all degrees of severity. A second converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, has been approved for the treatment of hypertension. Its efficacy and clinical characteristics appear similar to those of captopril. In double-blind clinical trials, comparisons with beta-blocker or diuretic therapy have shown captopril to be equal in efficacy but to produce fewer side effects or metabolic changes. In mild-to-moderate essential hypertension it is effective when administered in twice-daily doses of 25 or 50 mg; higher doses do not usually increase its BP-lowering effects. The combination of captopril with a diuretic in low doses has been shown to be especially effective. In additional studies, once-daily doses have controlled BP in a majority of hypertensive patients, but this method of administering captopril has not yet been formally approved. In lower doses, captopril may be less effective in black patients than in white patients, but black patients appear to respond well if the doses are increased. Antihypertensive effects in elderly patients during captopril treatment are equal to those in the young. Converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy appears to have broad utility and a favorable side effect profile in the treatment of essential hypertension.\r"

The reason for the many apparent discrepancies in the literature on effectiveness and risk have become clear only in the past decade. The results are poorest and the risk is greater, not surprisingly, in patients with advanced atherosclerosis involving many vascular beds. The results are much better in fibromuscular disease, both in terms of effectiveness and risk. Angioplasty has been available for a much shorter time, but a reasonable picture of the short-term effectiveness and the risk is emerging. The risk is substantially lower than that of surgery. The results are again best in fibromuscular disease. In atherosclerotic disease, the results are especially poor for the most common lesion, that involving the renal artery ostium. Medical therapy before the development of captopril was often difficult and often unsatisfactory. Since the development of converting-enzyme inhibition, medical therapy is an important option. In the early experience, reflecting the severity of the hypertension, the frequency with which azotemia was present, and the high dose of captopril used, the adverse reaction rate was substantial. In one study, none of 133 patients with unilateral renal arterial disease and an intact contralateral kidney developed renal failure. Among 136 patients with bilateral disease or a solitary kidney, renal failure occurred in 15 and led to discontinuation of therapy in 12. If surgery or angioplasty are contraindicated, one can modify the therapeutic goal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The renin-angiotensin system appears to have evolved millions of years ago as a primary attempt to preserve circulatory homeostasis at a time when the principal cause of a low cardiac output was intravascular volume depletion. Angiotensin II supported systemic BP by direct systemic vasoconstriction, by facilitating the central and peripheral effects of the sympathetic nervous system, by promoting renal sodium retention by the production of aldosterone, and by increasing total body water by enhancing thirst and the synthesis of vasopressin. In addition, angiotensin II evolved as an important mechanism to preserve the glomerular filtration rate in low-flow states. These actions of angiotensin II were beneficial when the system first evolved, but its activation in patients with heart failure not only fails to reverse the low-output state but further exacerbates loading conditions in the left ventricle, thereby leading to worsening heart failure. Moreover, increased levels of angiotensin II cause heightened sympathetic nervous activity, potassium depletion, and hyponatremia, each of which can lead to further clinical deterioration. Therefore, activation of the renin-angiotensin system in heart failure might appear (at first) to be a maladaptive response. Recent evidence, however, suggests that this hormonal system continues (even in heart failure) to carry out the primary functions for which it was designed. Angiotensin II plays an important role in preserving systemic BP and in preserving the glomerular filtration rate as renal artery pressure and renal blood flow decline; in addition, by stimulating the synthesis of aldosterone, the renin-angiotensin system provides an important role for potassium disposal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Compensatory mechanisms such as systemic vasoconstriction and sodium retention are activated to various degrees in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) mediates many of these compensatory responses. Increased angiotensin can result in net vasoconstriction and increase afterload. In addition, it contributes to the avid sodium retention that occurs in patients with CHF. The RAS promotes sodium retention by enhancing proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and water through changes in intrarenal hemodynamics. In addition, the direct renal tubular influence of angiotensin II and aldosterone contribute to sodium retention. In experimental heart failure in the rat, angiotensin activation leads to reduction in effective plasma flow whereas the glomerular filtration rate was unchanged. In clinical CHF, activation of the RAS may also contribute to azotemia in patients with CHF. Significant correlations between serum creatinine levels and plasma renin activity have been observed. Furthermore, renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate frequently improve after therapy with converting-enzyme inhibitors (CEIs). Occasionally, however, CEIs may produce an excessive fall in systemic BP and, hence, renal perfusion pressure, which may overcome autoregulatory mechanisms and contribute to a deterioration in renal function. CEIs enhance the effectiveness of furosemide in promoting natriuresis and correction of hyponatremia. Diuretic-induced hypokalemia can also be corrected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors due to blockade of aldosterone production. On the basis of these results, we recommend titration of the ACE inhibitors' dose to minimize hypotension and the concurrent use of furosemide in patients with CHF receiving ACE inhibitors, especially for those in whom azotemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia complicate the course.\r"

There is not enough separation between the changes in PRA of patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) to separate them reliably from those with essential hypertension. A minimal response may suggest primary aldosteronism. Captopril does increase the ratio of PRA in the venous blood from a kidney with RAS to that of the contralateral kidney. Captopril, 25 to 50 mg orally, given before renal vein PRA sampling will increase the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Treatment with current antihypertensive drugs need not be discontinued. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) used to be uniformly lethal within a few months. Modern, aggressive antihypertensive therapy has made survival of 2 or more years common. Not all patients respond, and some progress to renal failure despite good BP control. Captopril has been used with success in some patients with idiopathic edema. In conclusion, captopril markedly enhances the accuracy of renal vein renin assay for the diagnosis of RAS and is of major value in the treatment of SRC.\r"

The effects of betaxolol on renal function have not been reported. The effects of nadolol on renal function are controversial. The current randomized double-blind study was designed to compare the effects of betaxolol and nadolol on glomerular filtration rate, assessed by creatinine and inulin clearances, and renal hemodynamics, assessed by p-aminohippurate clearance. Following a 4-week placebo run-in period, 15 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to a mean dose of 22 mg betaxolol for 12 weeks, and 12 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to a mean dose of 103 mg nadolol for 12 weeks. Results indicate that neither drug produced a clinically relevant effect on renal function. These findings are consistent with previously reported observations with other beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. We conclude that neither of the beta-adrenergic antagonists, betaxolol or nadolol, convey a specific renal pharmacologic advantage; both are equally efficacious and safe in the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.\r"

We measured both the creatinine clearance (60 +/- 4.32 mL/min/1.73 m2) and the true GFR using Technetium 99m-DTPA (44 +/- 2.72 mL/min/1.73 m2). The creatinine clearance overestimated true GRF by a mean of 38%, indicating that this percentage of creatinine reached the urine by tubular secretion rather than glomerular filtration. A similar degree of overestimation was found in a separate group of 14 patients receiving imuran for immunosuppression. In 23 patients receiving CyA in whom the serum creatinine concentration was less than 2.0 mg/dL, the mean DTPA clearance was 49.5 +/- 2.83 mL/min/1.73 m2. In stable renal transplant patients receiving CyA, a serum creatinine concentration at, or close to, the upper limit of the normal range may reflect markedly impaired renal function.\r"

Therefore, eight male renal transplant recipients were assessed in a crossover study to determine the effects of acute ethanol ingestion on CyA serum concentrations.

Important predisposing factors include age, female sex, and recent instrumentation of the urinary tract. Renal infections in ADPKD are most commonly caused by gram-negative enteric organisms. Diagnosis of these infections may be difficult since some patients do not have bacteriuria. Eradication of cyst infections with conventional antibiotic therapy can be difficult despite in vitro sensitivity of responsible organisms to the agents administered. We review recent studies of the anatomic and functional characteristics of renal cysts and discuss their possible relevance to the treatment of renal cyst infections. Finally, we set forth guidelines for the use of diagnostic studies, antimicrobial therapy, and surgical intervention for polycystic kidney infections.\r"

  ".W": "The suggestion that hypertension is more prevalent in renal allograft recipients receiving cyclosporine (CyA), particularly those displaying nephrotoxicity, was tested by reviewing 200 patients' courses, including 92 cadaver (CAD) and 58 living-related (LRD) transplants using CyA and prednisone immunosuppression, and 19 CAD and 31 LRD transplants using azathioprine (Aza) and prednisone, all of whom had at least 1 year posttransplant complete outpatient follow-up. Both groups had a mean age of 33 years with a similar distribution of renal failure etiologies. Renal function was significantly impaired in the CyA group at all intervals (P less than .001, t test). The prevalence of hypertension was higher in the CyA group at all intervals, becoming significant at 12 (P less than .01) and 24 (P less than .05) months following transplantation (chi 2). While there was only a significant difference in mean diastolic BP at 12 months (P less than .05, t test), the mean number of antihypertensive and/or diuretic medications was significantly greater in the CyA group at 1 and 6 months (P less than .001) and at 12 months (P less than .01). By 24 months, the mean number of all antihypertensive and/or diuretic medications was no longer significantly different. However, the antihypertensive and diuretic requirements of the CyA group diminished with time, suggesting that the hypertension is not progressive if the CyA serum trough levels are maintained in the nontoxic range (less than 200 ng/mL).\r"

  ".U": "87267664\r", 
  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by specific abnormalities of the renin-angiotensin system, but it is not known whether these alterations modify the response to converting enzyme inhibition. To evaluate this possibility, 129 patients with severe chronic heart failure were treated with captopril or enalapril for one to three months, while doses of digoxin and diuretics were kept constant; 35 patients had diabetes mellitus. Prior to therapy, diabetic patients had lower plasma renin activity (3.4 +/- 0.5 versus 7.0 +/- 1.1 ng/ml/hour) than did nondiabetic control subjects (p less than 0.05); yet the initial hemodynamic response to captopril was similar in both groups. Plasma renin activity predicted the hypotensive response to the first dose of captopril in nondiabetic control subjects (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001) but not in diabetic patients (r = 0.29). During long-term treatment with captopril or enalapril, both diabetic and nondiabetic patients had similar increases in cardiac index and decreases in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Diabetic patients, however, showed larger reductions in left ventricular filling pressure (-13.8 versus -9.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.02) and mean right atrial pressure (-6.2 versus -3.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) than did nondiabetic subjects; this was accompanied by a notable decline in body weight in diabetic patients only. Renal function remained unaltered during converting enzyme inhibition in nondiabetic patients, but deteriorated significantly in diabetic patients, as reflected by a marked increase in serum creatinine concentration (1.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). In conclusion, despite lower pretreatment plasma renin activity, diabetic patients with severe chronic heart failure demonstrated improvement during long-term converting enzyme inhibition to a degree similar to (if not greater than) that seen in nondiabetic control subjects, but were more susceptible to the development of functional renal insufficiency than their nondiabetic counterparts. These differences are explicable by abnormalities of renin/aldosterone synthesis and angiotensin-mediated vasoregulation that are known to be present in the diabetic state.\r"

This provided an opportunity for an analysis of the separate influences of bone resorption and renal calcium handling on the genesis and maintenance of hypercalcemia. The results demonstrated that increased bone resorption is the major contributory factor and that inhibition with bisphosphonate normalizes the serum calcium concentration within five days in more than 90 percent of patients. Hypercalcemia is sustained by an inability of the kidney to deal efficiently with a chronically increased calcium load. This is influenced by the requirements of volume regulation in the presence of a sodium diuretic effect of hypercalcemia and is very sensitive to induced variations of sodium load. In addition, in a minority of patients, direct renal actions of tumor-derived humoral factors adversely reduce the ability to excrete calcium. For optimal treatment of tumor-induced hypercalcemia, bisphosphonate treatment should be combined with intravenous administration of saline solution.\r"

Histologically, the salient feature is a dense dermal infiltrate of neutrophils. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of published cases of Sweet's syndrome occurred in patients with cancer. This report reviews the 39 patients with malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome described in the world literature and compares Sweet's syndrome in cancer patients with the idiopathic form of the disease. The most common associated malignancy was acute myelogenous leukemia. However, other myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome, and carcinomas have been observed. Importantly, the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome was often the presenting sign of a new or recurrent tumor. The presence of anemia, abnormal platelet counts, immature cells in the differential, and/or severe vesiculobullous or ulcerative cutaneous lesions is infrequent in idiopathic Sweet's syndrome and should alert physicians to the possibility of a more serious underlying disease. Extracutaneous manifestations may occur and most often involve the musculoskeletal system. Response to systemic steroids is dramatic in virtually all patients, regardless of the presence of malignancy.\r"

Inappropriately low plasma free insulin levels (less than 60 mU/liter) during administration of extremely high insulin dosages (300 to 10,000 units per day) suggested that resistance was caused by rapid clearance of circulating insulin. There were several short periods of normal insulin sensitivity with hyperinsulinemia (more than 300 mU/liter) persisting long after intravenous insulin withdrawal, suggesting reentry to the circulation of intact, previously sequestered insulin. For four years, she has been treated with ambulatory continuous intravenous insulin infusion, which has been complicated by septicemia and central venous thrombosis.

Following administration of a 400-mg dose, peak serum concentrations of 1.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml are achieved within one to two hours. The drug is widely distributed throughout the body, achieves high ratios of tissue to serum concentrations in both renal and prostatic tissue, and undergoes metabolic conversion. Six metabolites of norfloxacin have been identified. Approximately 30 percent of an administered dose is excreted as unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following a single dose of norfloxacin, therapeutic levels of drug in the urine are achieved rapidly and maintained for at least 12 to 24 hours. Norfloxacin has a terminal elimination half-life of approximately three hours, although the presence of a reduced glomerular filtration rate increases the elimination half-life. Dosage modification is, therefore, necessary when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 20 ml/minute.\r"

The clinical experience with norfloxacin as treatment for a variety of urinary tract infection syndromes, uncomplicated gonococcal infection, and diarrheal disease, and as prophylaxis of infection in neutropenic patients with cancer, is reviewed. Norfloxacin appears at least equivalent to standard regimens for the treatment of acute urinary tract infections; however, long-term studies are needed to define its role in the treatment of recurrent urinary infections. Initial studies of norfloxacin treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infection and bacterial gastroenteritis are also promising, and in neutropenic patients, continuous norfloxacin prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of gram-negative infections. Further prospective evaluation is required to confirm these findings.\r"

An earlier study demonstrated that a two-dose regimen of norfloxacin was as effective as standard therapy with spectinomycin for treating gonococcal urethritis, including infections caused by penicillinase-producing organisms. In this randomized study of treatment for uncomplicated gonococcal infection in men and women, three oral treatment regimens were compared: patients received either two doses of norfloxacin (600 mg twice daily), a single dose of norfloxacin (800 mg), or a single-dose ampicillin (3.5 g)/probenecid (1.0 g) regimen (as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control). All three treatment regimens achieved similar cure rates. Although the number of patients treated was too small to yield statistically significant conclusions, it appears that norfloxacin may be slightly better treatment for rectal and pharyngeal gonococcal infections than ampicillin and probenecid. Additionally, norfloxacin was well tolerated in this study. Thus, based on a review of these data, norfloxacin appears to be an alternative, single-dose, oral treatment regimen for uncomplicated gonococcal infection.\r"

  ".W": "In a multiclinic, randomized trial, oral norfloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial, was compared with several standard parenteral regimens for the treatment of nonbacteremic, hospital-acquired urinary tract infections. Parenteral antibiotic agents included aminoglycosides alone; aminoglycosides in combination with either broad-spectrum penicillins or first-generation cephalosporins; or cefotaxime alone. Ninety-two percent of bacterial isolates were multiresistant gram-negative rods including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31 percent), Escherichia coli (17 percent), Klebsiella/Enterobacter species (14 percent), and Serratia species (11 percent). In the first evaluable 94 patients, norfloxacin was comparable to the parenteral agents in eliminating infecting bacteria from the urine. Similarly, combined bacterial eradication and clinical cure or improvement occurred in 96 percent (76 percent with cures, 20 percent with improvement) of those treated with norfloxacin and 88 percent (67 percent with cures, 21 percent with improvement) of those treated with parenteral agents. A negative outcome (i.e., failure, superinfection, or reinfection) occurred in two (4 percent) norfloxacin-treated patients versus six (12 percent) parenterally treated patients. Adverse effects were few, infrequently drug related, and rarely serious (one with norfloxacin versus two with parenteral agents). Additionally, drug, preparation, and administration costs were substantially less with oral norfloxacin compared with the parenteral agents. The data suggest, therefore, that oral norfloxacin can be substituted for commonly used parenteral antibiotic regimens, without any compromise in efficacy, in the treatment of nonbacteremic patients with multiresistant, nosocomial urinary tract infections.\r"

Norfloxacin was relatively safe and highly effective in treating both uncomplicated UTIs (86 percent cure rate) and complicated UTIs (75 percent cure rate). Failure of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy was associated with initial bacterial resistance, e.g., from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens; such multiresistant bacteria were successfully treated with norfloxacin. Thus, norfloxacin appears to extend the range of oral agents available to treat UTIs.\r"

Treatment duration ranged from a required minimum of seven days to a maximum of 30 days. If an underlying anatomic or functional condition existed that might decrease the likelihood of a favorable medical response and/or require prolonged treatment, the patient's UTI was considered \"complicated.\" In addition to eight patients with polymicrobic UTIs (usually involving enterococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa), 48 men (i.e., 51 percent of the total population) had an identifiable complication. Complications included benign prostatic hypertrophy in 13 patients; prostatic cancer in four; urethral stricture in four; quadriplegia/paraplegia with indwelling urinary catheter in four; prostatism in three; and other conditions commonly recognized as altering the response to antibiotic treatment. Among the 95 patients treated, 76 (80 percent) were considered to have had a cure and five (5 percent) showed improvement. Fourteen patients (15 percent) failed to show a response to treatment. Of the 48 patients with UTI and defined complications, 36 (75 percent) had a cure, three (6 percent) showed improvement, and therapy failed in nine (19 percent). Ninety-seven percent (105 of 108) of the pretreatment bacterial isolates were susceptible to norfloxacin. In addition to the three resistant organisms that were present prior to therapy, three organisms (two P. aeruginosa and one Enterobacter) persisted and acquired resistance during therapy. Five adverse clinical experiences and six adverse laboratory experiences were noted. Only one of the former (mild heartburn) was thought to be drug related, and no adverse experience was considered serious or required discontinuation of treatment. Gastrointestinal tolerability of oral norfloxacin was good.\r"

Clinical cure occurred in 89 percent (lower dose) and 91 percent (higher dose) of those treated with norfloxacin, compared with 78 percent of those receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; cure rates in each treatment group were greater when the patient's stool contained fecal leukocytes. In 105 of 106 (99 percent) patients treated with either dose of norfloxacin and in 49 of 52 (94 percent) trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-treated subjects, the bacterial enteropathogen identified in the pretreatment stool was eradicated on the posttreatment specimen. Two percent (two patients) of those receiving the lower dose of norfloxacin, 3 percent (two patients) of those receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 4 percent (three patients) of those receiving the higher dose of norfloxacin experienced minor and transient adverse hematologic or blood chemistry reactions. In addition, mild cutaneous reactions that were attributed to the study medications developed in two patients receiving the higher dose of norfloxacin and in three patients who received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. These studies indicate that norfloxacin is safe and effective therapy for bacterial diarrhea.\r"

Conversely, studies in laboratory animals and neutropenic humans using norfloxacin for selective decontamination of the digestive tract have shown that norfloxacin markedly reduces the aerobic enteric flora without reducing fecal anaerobic flora. In an effort to resolve this paradox, the effect of a 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml inoculum, which is more reflective of actual fecal counts than the standard 10(5) cfu/ml inoculum, on the activity of norfloxacin against two fecal Escherichia coli isolates and 16 fecal anaerobic isolates was studied. The results showed a marked inoculum effect at 10(9) cfu/ml for most anaerobic isolates but not for the E. coli strains tested. At 256 micrograms/ml, all E. coli were killed while the anaerobic bacteria maintained colony counts greater than or equal to 10(9) cfu/ml. Hence, the lack of anaerobic activity (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than or equal to 512 micrograms/ml) at higher fecal inocula might explain the utility of norfloxacin in selective decontamination of the bowel.\r"

The literature has been reviewed to determine the clinical features of each disorder and to provide a schema for diagnosis and management. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is seen primarily in diabetic patients, whereas emphysematous pyelitis is recognized most often in association with urinary tract obstruction. The diagnosis is made radiographically by demonstrating renal gas on plain abdominal roentgenography or intravenous pyelography. Location and extent of renal gas are best evaluated by computed tomographic scanning. Intraparenchymal gas usually requires nephrectomy, whereas successful therapy of gas limited to the collecting system involves medical management, with a drainage procedure when obstruction coexists.\r"

Subjects were followed for one year. The therapy group had a mean monthly prevalence of bacteriuria 31 +/- 15 percent lower than those in the no-therapy group, but periods free of bacteriuria lasting six months or longer were documented for only five (24 percent) subjects. For residents receiving no therapy, 71 percent showed persistent infection with the same organism(s). Antimicrobial therapy was associated with an increased incidence of reinfection (1.67 versus 0.87 per patient-year) and adverse antimicrobial drug effects (0.51 versus 0.046 per patient-year) as well as isolation of increasingly resistant organisms in recurrent infection when compared with no therapy. No differences in genitourinary morbidity or mortality were observed between the groups. Thus, despite a lowered prevalence of bacteriuria, no short-term benefits were identified and some harmful effects were observed with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. These data support current recommendations of no therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria in this population.\r"

To determine whether suppressed plasma renin activity is due to extracellular fluid volume expansion, 10 cyclosporine-treated renal transplant recipients were compared with 10 azathioprine-treated renal transplant recipients and seven patients with renal insufficiency. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were significantly lower in cyclosporine-treated patients than in azathioprine-treated patients. Upright plasma renin activity was suppressed in cyclosporine-treated patients (cyclosporine 2.9 +/- 0.9, azathioprine 4.7 +/- 0.9, renal insufficiency 5.2 +/- 1.9 ng/ml/hour) but could be stimulated by a four-day period of dietary sodium restriction and diuretic administration (cyclosporine 15.8 +/- 4.4 ng/ml/hour). Extracellular fluid volume tended to be higher in cyclosporine-treated patients (cyclosporine 30.7 +/- 2.3, azathioprine 26.7 +/- 2.5, renal insufficiency 25.5 +/- 1.4 percent lean body mass), although the difference between cyclosporine-treated and azathioprine-treated patients did not attain statistical significance. There were no differences in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 or 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha between the two groups of renal transplant recipients. It is concluded that suppression of plasma renin activity by cyclosporine is physiologic and may reflect expansion of extracellular fluid volume, which can be reversed by sodium depletion.\r"

To evaluate lung function over time in PSS, a battery of lung function tests were prospectively performed serially between 1973 and 1982 in 61 patients with PSS. Functional indexes of restriction (vital capacity and total lung capacity) and diffusion impairment (diffusing capacity) showed greater-than-expected annual rates of change. Male subjects showed a trend toward faster declines in forced vital capacity, forced expired volume in one second, total lung capacity, and functional residual capacity and a more rapid increase in static recoil pressure at 90 percent of total lung capacity than did female subjects. Nonsmokers had greater rates of decline in total lung capacity and static lung compliance (but not in forced vital capacity or diffusing capacity) and a greater rate of increase in static recoil pressure than did current and former smokers. Level of lung function at initial study visit, age, race, and chlorambucil therapy had no significant effect on the annual rates of change in lung function, whereas longer duration of disease prior to study entry was associated with a slower annual decrease in lung volumes. Between the first and last visits (mean interval 3.1 years, maximum nine years), the frequency of abnormality in pulmonary function test results showed significant change only in the diffusing capacity (60 percent increasing to 82 percent) and static lung compliance (40 percent increasing to 54 percent), whereas the frequency of respiratory symptoms showed little change. These findings indicate an overall indolent progression of PSS-related lung disease, with substantial individual variability.\r"

Criteria for identification were the Rf of the bands within the gel, immunologic crossreactivity to specific antisera, and structural verification by tyrosine peptide-mapping of individual bands from the gel. The authors found the tumor-tissue to be characterized by the presence of a PRL band greater in concentration than in the normal tissue and the virtual absence of a GH band. Immunoblotting of the electrophoretically resolved proteins form both types of tissues revealed several new bands crossreactive with human PRL and GH antibodies. Some of the new bands were of Mr greater than the monomeric PRL and GH and others were of lower Mr. Relative of two of the low mobility Mr PRL-immunoreactive bands designated as 16K and 8K corresponded to the Rf of the two fragments of cleaved PRL, which suggested that cleaved PRL occurred naturally in the human pituitary gland. The most conspicuous of the new PRL-immunoreactive bands, a 25,000 Mr protein migrating slightly behind PRL, displayed strong crossreactivity to hPRL antibodies and was present in greater concentration in the prolactinoma tissue than in the normal tissue. These properties suggested that it was related to hPRL and perhaps represented its glycosylated variant. However, its tyrosine peptide map did not resemble that of hPRL. Thus, it is not clear whether it represented G-hPRL or a new pituitary protein that cross-reacts with hPRL antibodies. In addition, two other bands of low Mr, designated as unknown 1 and unknown 2, reacted with hPRL antibodies. Immunostaining with hGH antibodies revealed the 20K-hGH variant, the F1 fragment of cleaved hGH, and a pair of new bands immediately behind GH that could represent glycosylated hGH--possibly a product of Seeburg's variant hGH gene. Both PRL and GH antibodies elicited numerous bands of high Mr by the technique employed, far more than ever observed by Sephadex chromatography. The nature of the high Mr bands remains unknown. Further characterization of these new PRL- and GH-immunoreactive proteins might help in the understanding of the multiple physiologic functions of PRL and GH in man.\r"

A review of pregnancies complicated by hydramnios was undertaken; 99 cases with complete pregnancy and delivery information were identified. Fifty-nine pregnancies were complicated by idiopathic hydramnios, and except for the hydramnios, sonographic evaluation was normal. Delivery information revealed one infant with trisomy 18 and eight infants with structural anomalies not appreciated antenatally. Of the undiagnosed malformations, 25% are frequently associated with trisomy 21. We recommend fetal chromosomal analysis as an adjunct to the evaluation of pregnancies complicated by idiopathic hydramnios.\r"

Fifty-five women were in the follicular phase, and 55 were in the luteal phase of the cycle. The two groups were well matched for age and body weight. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide either in the fasting state or after the oral glucose load did not differ in the two groups. These results suggest that in nondiabetic women the menstrual cycle has no major effect on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion and that the phase of the menstrual cycle should not be considered in programming and interpreting an oral glucose tolerance test.\r"

Overall dispensed drug use (excluding vitamins) decreased during pregnancy; however, there was still substantial exposure to drugs including drugs that are contraindicated during pregnancy. During the gestational period, study mothers received an average of 3.1 prescriptions for nonvitamin drugs. Black mothers received more exposure to drugs other than vitamins than did white mothers. Black mothers had higher rates of exposure to analgesics, ampicillin, codeine, and vaginal preparations. Similarities between black and white mothers in the use of vitamins with and without other drugs suggest there is no racial difference in attaining prenatal care within the Medicaid system, but that black mothers may have more medical problems that warrant the use of other medications in addition to vitamins during pregnancy.\r"

A fetal blood sample obtained from percutaneous ultrasound-guided fetal blood sampling can offer vital information about the underlying cause of nonimmune hydrops fetalis, and perinatal management can be planned accordingly. Ten cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis were investigated with percutaneous ultrasound-guided fetal blood sampling and subsequent fetal blood analysis. Nine were proved to be Bart's hemoglobin hydrops fetalis, with 78.2% to 99% of Bart's hemoglobin in the fetal blood. Terminations of pregnancy were undertaken immediately, resulting in a lowered maternal morbidity rate. Free cord loops or an intra-abdominal portion of the dilated umbilical vein can be used for percutaneous fetal blood sampling in nonimmune hydrops fetalis when the placental cord insertion is difficult to visualize. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided fetal blood sampling and subsequent fetal blood analysis will eventually play a key role in the management of the puzzling nonimmune hydrops fetalis if the safety of ultrasound-guided fetal blood sampling can be verified by further clinical studies.\r"

The basement membrane contains collagen types III, IV, and V, the glycoproteins laminin and fibronectin, and the basement membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The trabecular basement membrane is unlike most subendothelial basement membranes because it contains collagen type III and a relatively disorganized structure. The central core contains collagen types I and III, and elastin. The closely linked juxtacanalicular meshwork contains collagen type III, but no collagen type I or elastin. The connective tissue composition of the trabecular meshwork appears similar to other highly compliant and resilient tissues, such as lung, blood vessels, and conjunctiva.\r"

To clarify the underlying mechanism, they investigated the morphologic alterations in the thymus and other lymphoid tissues and the serum immunoglobulin abnormalities in mice receiving CsA. Feeding male Swiss Webster mice with diets containing 0.015% and 0.027% CsA for 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks led to a marked reduction of the thymic medulla. Thymocytes remaining after CsA treatment were completely destroyed by a single injection of cortisone acetate (8 mg/mice), and cortisone-resistant cells were markedly decreased. Immunoperoxidase staining using anti-keratin antibodies showed a decrease in the number of keratin-positive cells, presumably epithelial cells, in the thymus of CsA-treated mice. These changes were completely reversible within 4 weeks after withdrawing CsA from the diet. The lymph nodes and the gut-associated lymphoid tissues of CsA-treated mice showed blurring of the germinal centers, diminished Thy-1-positive lymphocytes, and proliferation of lymphocytes carrying IgG, IgM, and IgA on their surface. Similar changes were observed in the spleens of CsA-treated mice. There was a slight increase in serum IgG, a twofold increase in serum IgM, and a six- to tenfold increase in serum IgA. The results suggest that CsA interferes with the functions of both T and B lymphocytes in vivo and that disturbance of T-cell maturation in the thymus may be the mechanism by which CsA promotes the induction of thymic lymphomas in mice.\r"

The antisera raised against all four enzymes from rat liver cross-reacted with the corresponding proteins in homogenates of human liver as revealed by immunoblotting. For light-microscopic localization in glutaraldehyde-fixed Epon-embedded material, the removal of resin and controlled digestion with trypsin was necessary. At the ultrastructural level specific labeling for all four antigens was found by the protein A-gold technique in peroxisomes of liver parenchymal cells fixed with formaldehyde-low glutaraldehyde concentrations and embedded in Lowicryl K4M. In biopsies fixed with glutaraldehyde and embedded in Epon, treatment with metaperiodate or etching with sodium ethoxide improved the immunolabeling. After such treatment catalase showed the most intense labeling and acyl-CoA oxidase the weakest, the two other proteins exhibiting an intermediate immunoreaction. In material postfixed with osmium only catalase could be visualized in peroxisomes. The immunocytochemical investigation of peroxisomal proteins in human liver biopsies provides a simple and highly promising approach for further elucidation of the pathophysiology of peroxisomal disorders.\r"

Technical factors--infections, thrombosis, obstruction--accounted for a large number of graft losses, but immunologic-mediated mechanisms resulted in graft dysfunction and failure as well. Pleomorphic inflammatory infiltrates were present in grafts with acute rejection, as well as Silastic and Prolamine duct-obstructed grafts. Criteria useful in the identification of acute rejection from pancreatitis included a more intense, predominantly mononuclear cell infiltration of transformed lymphocytes in the exocrine pancreas and evidence of vascular rejection--endovasculitis or fibrinoid necrosis. Increased expression and/or induction of Class I and II antigens on pancreatic constituents occurred in grafts with evidence of acute rejection, but also with Silastic and prolamine duct-obstructed pancreatitis. An isletitis occurred in 25% of the grafts. Nine of the 25 grafts (36%) with isletitis also had selective loss of beta cells from the islets. Recurrent diabetes mellitus appeared to have developed in these cases, which accounted for loss of graft function.\r"

Rats were immunized subcutaneously and 2 weeks later intravenously with BCG. During the early phase of pulmonary inflammation, an increase was observed in the numbers of alveolar macrophages with no peroxidase activity in the endoplasmic reticulum. These cells appeared to reflect monocyte influx into the injured lung. The later stages of inflammation were characterized by increased numbers of alveolar macrophages with peroxidase-positive endoplasmic reticulum, probably due to activation of enzymatic activity in situ. During the early phase, peroxidase activity was also observed within macrophage cytoplasmic inclusions, probably representing both primary monocyte lysosomes and internalized myeloperoxidase from inflammatory neutrophils. Serial observations indicated that the peroxidase-positive cytoplasmic inclusions became negative with time. It is concluded that inflammation-induced modulation of peroxidase activity in the endoplasmic reticulum and in cytoplasmic inclusions makes the alveolar macrophage peroxidase phenotype no more than a rough marker of monocyte influx into the inflamed lung.\r"

Fibronectin stained intensely and appeared to be the predominant component of the provisional subendothelial matrix during vascular sprouting. As the cultures aged, laminin and Type IV collagen accumulated in the subendothelial space, forming a continuous feltwork around the newly formed microvessels. Patent microvessels were also surrounded by discontinuous deposits of fibronectin and by increased amounts of collagen Types I, III, and V. Ultrastructural studies revealed positive immunostaining for fibronectin, laminin, and collagen Types IV and V in the endoplasmic reticulum and in putative secretory vesicles, indicating active synthesis and secretion of these molecules by the endothelial cells. These observations indicate that the microvascular extracellular matrix undergoes significant dynamic changes during capillary development. The different composition and structural organization of the extracellular matrix at various stages of angiogenesis may have important effects on endothelial behavior and capillary morphogenesis.\r"

Benign neoplasms displayed typical light-microscopic features of SM, whereas leiomyosarcomas demonstrated variations in their histologic pattern. In 6 sarcomas, light microscopy suggested a SM differentiation, whereas in the other 4, a predominant nondistinctive spindle-cell pattern was observed. By transmission electron microscopy, all 13 neoplasms showed the minimal essential features of SM differentiation. Immunofluorescence disclosed heterogeneity of cytoskeletal protein expression: 5 neoplasms (3 benign and 2 malignant well-differentiated) expressed desmin, vimentin, and alpha-SM-actin; 2 malignant neoplasms expressed desmin and vimentin; 1 malignant neoplasm expressed desmin, vimentin and alpha-SR actin; 1 malignant neoplasm expressed vimentin and alpha-SR actin; and 4 malignant neoplasms expressed vimentin alone. By 2D-GE, 3 benign and 4 malignant SM neoplasms expressed alpha, beta, and gamma actins, and the remaining expressed only beta and gamma actins. The presence of alpha-SM actin in all benign neoplasms and in 2 well-differentiated leiomyosarcomas suggests that this actin isoform reflects a high degree of cellular differentiation. In 2 leiomyosarcomas, alpha-SR actin was detected by immunofluorescence, which suggested a skeletal muscle differentiation of these neoplasms. This study supports the assumption that leiomyosarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms and furnishes new criteria for their characterization.\r"

More than one-half of the responders achieved clinical remission at doses (less than or equal to 100 mg/day) and plasma levels (less than or equal to 150 ng/ml) considered to be subtherapeutic for depression. There appears to be neither a clear threshold for response nor a therapeutic dose range for imipramine in the treatment of panic.

Cause and effect having been separated by some three decades, the epidemiologic connections between these events in Charleston seem not to have been appreciated hitherto.\r"

One hundred four sera from U.S. residents were used to determine a cut-off value for reactivity. Test sera were considered reactive when the absorbance was greater than that at the 95th percentile of the control sera. Sera from 112 Kenyans living in an area of holoendemic malaria transmission were tested. Of the total number of sera, 65% had detectable antibody to (NANP)3. The percentage of reactive sera increased from 41% in sera from children under 4 years of age to 85% in sera from adults 20 to 39 years of age. The high exposure to malaria parasites of the Kenyans was reflected in indirect fluorescent antibody assay titers to blood stage P. falciparum parasites.

Antibodies against Pf155 can be detected by a cell-ELISA technique with glutaraldehyde-fixed and air dried P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes as antigen. Using this assay, we measured the level of antibodies in sera from 230 subjects with various degrees of past exposure to P. falciparum. Significant levels of antibodies (OD492 greater than 0.5) were detected in 41/50 sera from Central African adults and in 34/50 sera from West African adults. All sera from 50 European adults suffering primary malarial attack and 28/30 sera from West African children (10 to 12 years old) were negative. Intermediate results were obtained with 50 sera from West African adults living in France for greater than or equal to 2 years (12 positive). Mean OD values of the sera of these five groups of subjects varied in the same direction as the positivity rates. These preliminary results suggest that the level of anti-Pf155 antibodies as detected by cell-ELISA might provide an assessment of protective immunity against P. falciparum which could complement clinical or epidemiological criteria.\r"

The sequence PFR1, its antiparallel oligomer PFR1R, and PFR1 covalently attached to biotin hybridized similarly to P. falciparum DNA. One-microliter aliquots of blood from Zaire spotted on prewet nylon filters and hybridized with PFR1 gave detectable autoradiogram signals from samples with parasitemias as low as 1,000 parasites/mm3. Blood lysis and protein digestion followed by alkylation allowed dot-blot processing of larger aliquots of blood. After hybridization with PFR 1 and autoradiography, 26 samples were scored positive visually, compared with 34 scored positive by microscopy. The effective sensitivity for processed 10-microliter samples was about 500 parasites/mm3. Signals from hybridized probes were quantitated by liquid scintillation counting and densitometry, and were proportional to the amounts of purified P. falciparum DNA applied to the filter. Autoradiogram signals also were roughly proportional (correlation coefficient, r = 0.77) to the number of parasites/mm3 of blood from field samples as determined by microscopic examination.\r"

The optimal concentrations of PABA and folic acid for parasite growth and drug susceptibility, as evaluated by microscopic examination and by the extent of incorporation of radioactive 14C-pyrimethamine and 14C-sulfadoxine, were 10 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml, respectively. Depletion of PABA and folic acid from the medium had no effect on drug-resistant parasites but multiplication of drug-sensitive isolates was markedly reduced. Medium containing 0.5 ng/ml PABA and 10 ng/ml folic acid was the best for parasite growth regardless of the degree of drug sensitivity. Results obtained by using this medium agreed most closely with results from in vivo observations.\r"

Including this series, a total of 41 patients with fulminant hepatic failure have been transplanted, with a survival rate of 61 percent. We have reported eight liver transplantations carried out in six patients. Four of the patients survived (66 percent). Death was due to irreversible neurologic dysfunction in one patient and fungal sepsis in one patient. These results indicate that orthotopic liver transplantation is a practical therapeutic option for fulminant hepatic failure which should be considered early, before neurologic deterioration becomes irreversible.\r"

Because of scarring, absent parts, and the malposition of segments, correction of long-standing traumatic deformities remains difficult and treatment results remain less than ideal. Primary correction utilizing the principles we have described herein still provides the best functional and aesthetic results. Facial fractures can no longer be considered as an independent and unrelated entity when dealing with the traumatized patient. If primary reconstruction continues to be compromised, correction of residual disfigurement will result in unnecessary patient morbidity and disturbances of facial form and function.\r"

  ".W": "The historical development of in situ saphenous vein bypass has been traced over the past quarter century. The principal advantage of the in situ vein graft over the conventional reversed vein graft is the increase in flow that occurs in a tapered channel. Both the advantages of this hemodynamic observation in the in situ graft and its disadvantages in the reversed graft are accentuated in longer bypasses as the discrepancy in proximal and distal vein diameter increases. Furthermore, there is new evidence that unusual shear and stress tend to occur at sites of severe vein-artery discrepancy, such as seen in reversed vein grafts but less so in the in situ graft. Experience with the in situ graft has shown that another important advantage is that there is less chance of trauma to the vein from overdistention and rotation, which is inherent in the operation since the vein is not removed from its bed. On the other hand, the overly traumatic disruption of venous valves required in the in situ operation can cause subendothelial damage with resultant fibrosis of the vein. Although it has been demonstrated that equally good results with reversed as with in situ grafts can be obtained by careful attention to detail, this is true only for grafts carried to the popliteal level. The advantages of increased flow and less shear damage because of tapering, physiologic distention under arterial pressure, and finally, decreased handling and manipulation of the vein have become increasingly important as bypass is carried distal to the knee. I believe that the evidence to date indicates that the in situ operation has strong superiority over the conventional reversed graft for reconstructive operations on the lower extremity extending below the knee.\r"

These data, in turn, have been compared with a previously published retrospective review of the world literature from 1900 to 1977. It has become clear that since 1978, splenic abscess is diagnosed earlier in its presentation due to the widespread use of improved imaging techniques, immunocompromised patients comprise a much larger proportion of patients (24 percent) than previously due to increasing use of steroids and chemotherapeutic agents, and the diagnosis of fungal splenic abscess, almost unheard of before 1978, has increased to 26 percent of patients. The diagnostic sensitivity of computerized tomography (96 percent) has clearly been shown to be superior to ultrasonography, and gallium, indium, and technetium-99m liver and spleen scanning. The diagnosis of splenic abscess, however, is still often not considered due to its rarity and the presence of predisposing conditions which obscure its clinical presentation. Untreated splenic abscess is still fatal, and although splenectomy is the mainstay of treatment, it appears that antifungal treatment without splenectomy can be recommended for patients with disseminated fungal disease as long as bacterial abscess has been ruled out by invasive culture techniques. Scattered reports of percutaneous drainage exist and are increasing in the literature, although the results are as yet inconclusive. Eventual recovery depends on early diagnosis and successful treatment of the underlying condition.\r"

In all instances, the sCT-treated patients had significantly less postoperative pain. Similarly, the requests for analgesics was significantly lower or absent in the sCT-treated group. Minor side effects such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and \"nervousness\" were observed in a small number of sCT-treated patients. In our series of 30 patients, subarachnoid administration of sCT was an effective analgesic with minimal side effects. Its safety remains to be proved by further studies.\r"

The subjects were assigned to one of three groups: group 1 received 0.025 mg/kg ATR; group 2 received 0.05 mg/kg DTC; and group 3 received saline (NS), all in a double-blind manner. Thiopental was administered 1 min and 45 sec after pretreatment in doses adequate to allow control of ventilation. Three minutes after pretreatment, SDC 1.5 mg/kg was given, and fasciculations were recorded on a scale of 0-3. All patients were questioned 1 and 3 days postoperatively about POM, using a scale of 0-3. Fasciculations occurred in 79% of patients given saline, in 46% of those receiving ATR, and in 12% of those given DTC. Eighty-five percent of ATR patients were free of POM on postoperative day 1. The corresponding figures for DTC and NS were 59% and 43%, respectively. Only the difference between ATR and NS achieved statistical significance. On the third postoperative day, POM was rare and there were no significant differences among the groups. We conclude that DTC is a better defasciculant than ATR. DTC was, however, not significantly better than NS in the prevention of POM. The findings suggest that ATR may be the drug choice for the prevention of POM.\r"

Under double-blind conditions, incremental equipotent doses of meperidine, morphine, fentanyl, or sufentanil were administered IV for induction of anesthesia, prior to thiopental, succinylcholine, and intubation. Arterial blood samples were drawn before and 1, 6, and 20 min after narcotic administration. Of the 16 patients given meperidine (mean dose 4.3 +/- 0.2 (SEM) mg/kg), five (31%) had clinical signs (hypotension, tachycardia, erythema) and elevations in plasma histamine levels ranging from 3.2 to 49.7 ng/ml 1 min after narcotic administration. Plasma epinephrine levels at this time were also elevated in these five patients. One of the ten patients given morphine (0.6 +/- 0.02 mg/kg) developed hypotension, tachycardia, and an increase in plasma histamine level to 12.4 ng/ml. None of 34 patients given either fentanyl (7 +/- 0.4 micrograms/kg) or sufentanil (1.3 +/- 0.1 microgram/kg) had clinical signs of histamine release or elevations of plasma histamine levels. In the six patients in whom histamine release occurred, there was a significant correlation between the histamine levels at 1 min and the magnitude of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and plasma epinephrine level. All six histamine releasers were young women, ranging in age from 18 to 35 yr. Histamine release occurred more frequently after meperidine than after the other narcotics, including morphine, and the degree of hemodynamic compromise was related to the increase in plasma histamine concentration.\r"

All patients were anesthetized with thiopental, nitrous oxide, and enflurane, and drugs were administered epidurally at the end of the operation. The duration of analgesia in the ketamine groups did not differ from that in control patients and the difference in diluent had no observable effects. Significantly, none of the patients in the morphine group needed additional analgesics within 24 hr, whereas 85% in the other five groups did.

The authors tested the possibility that in another canine model of pulmonary capillary leak, that induced by endobronchial instillation of hydrochloric acid, nitroprusside would reduce Ppw and edema without reducing Qt or oxygen delivery (QO2). In 18 dogs, the authors measured extravascular lung water (EVLW) by thermal-dye dilution and the hemodynamic and gas exchange variables before and at intervals (1, 1.5, 3, and 5 h) after .1 N HCl bronchial infusion. By 1 h, HCl increased EVLW from 175 to 250 ml and Qva/Qt from 11 to 21%. Immediately after the 1-h measurements, the dogs were divided into three equal groups: six controls (C) were maintained with a Ppw of 12 mmHg, while plasmapheresis (P) or nitroprusside (NP) reduced Ppw to 5 mmHg for the next 4 h. EVLW continued to increase to 548 ml in C, but did not increase further in P and NP. Weights of lungs excised at 5 h confirmed that P and NP reduced edema by 50% in 4 h. In C, Qva/Qt increased, but there was no reduction in Qt or QO2. In contrast, plasmapheresis reduced Qva/Qt, Qt, and QO2. With nitroprusside, Qt and QO2 were maintained despite reduced Ppw at 1.5 and 3 h, and Qva/Qt did not decrease as in Group P. We conclude that plasmapheresis-induced reduction in Ppw reduces the pulmonary capillary leak and venous admixture following acid aspiration, but this has the potentially adverse effect of reducing cardiac output and oxygen delivery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The BMS injection (0.2 ml/kg) over 15 min caused rapid, but transient, increases (p less than 0.05) in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. These increases were accompanied by significant increases in the lymph concentrations of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Pulmonary lymph flow increased by 3.9-fold (+/- 0.8) over baseline by 120 min after BMS with no change in the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (L/P ratio). Heparin pretreatment (700 U/kg) enhanced the BMS-induced increases in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Thromboxane B2 concentrations in the lymph increased, whereas there was no change in the concentration of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Lung lymph flow increased 4-fold (+/- 1.0) over baseline by 120 min after BMS without a change in L/P ratio. Changes in lung vascular permeability were evaluated by elevating pulmonary microvascular pressure (left atrial balloon catheter inflation) at 120 min after BMS. Lung lymph flow increased 7-fold (+/- 1.1) from baseline, whereas the L/P ratio decreased to a mean value of 0.48 +/- 0.03.

The underlying defect in the control of breathing has not, however, been confirmed. We studied a 6-yr-old girl who was admitted in respiratory failure after a long history of disturbed breathing awake and asleep, which had been diagnosed as primary alveolar hypoventilation, (PaCO2 = 120). After several days of endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation, her condition improved and she was extubated. At this time her ventilatory response to hypoxia was absent (VE/SaO2:0.1 l/min/% at a CO2 of 45) and there was a right-shifted response to hypercapnia (VE/PaCO2:2.6 l/min/mmHg). As obstructive sleep apnea was suspected, nocturnal nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was tried; however, it was not effective in maintaining arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation. Definite central apneas were observed during sleep both with and without nasal CPAP, and there was an absence of snoring. Her condition deteriorated, and there was a progressive increase in her awake arterial CO2 levels for a period of 4 wk. The IPPV with 5 cm H2O of PEEP was administered through a nose mask during sleep and this maintained both oxygen saturation and transcutaneous CO2 levels within the normal range. After 10 days of nocturnal assisted ventilation, the hypercapnic response returned to the normal position (VE/CO2:2.1 l/min/mmHg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of acute lung injury in humans is obscure, but lipopolysaccharide (LPS), complement activation, and neutrophils have been implicated. We investigated in rabbits the interaction of small amounts of intravascularly administered LPS (100 ng) with neutrophil chemotactic factors, the synthetic chemotactic peptide formyl-norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FNLP), and the biologically relevant chemotactic fragments of C5 (C5f). These neutrophil stimuli produce neutropenia when injected intravascularly in rabbits, reflecting neutrophil adherence to vascular endothelium. When LPS was injected with FNLP, the duration of neutropenia was enhanced. Studies with radiolabeled neutrophils infused in vivo demonstrated prolonged neutrophil sequestration within the lung in rabbits that were given FNLP plus LPS, an effect that was visible for 4 h after injection. Morphometric analysis of tissue sections 4 h after infusion confirmed the presence of greater numbers of neutrophils in the lungs of animals receiving LPS and FNLP. When a combination of LPS and chemotactic factors was infused at both zero and 6 h, we found a marked enhancement of lung vascular permeability at 24 h (as assessed by radiolabeled albumin accumulation), an effect not seen with either LPS or chemotactic factor alone. Ultrastructural studies revealed neutrophil sequestration and alteration in endothelial cells in the animals that received the combination of LPS and chemotactic factors. Neutrophil depletion with nitrogen mustard completely abolished the increased vascular permeability seen in animals that received LPS and chemotactic factors. This study suggests that small amounts of intravascularly administered LPS enhance the sequestration of neutrophils within the lung and increase lung vascular permeability and endothelial injury caused by neutrophils stimulated by intravascularly administered chemotactic factors. This mechanism may be relevant to the production of acute lung injury in human beings.\r"

The purpose of this paper is to consider whether membrane lipids (platelet-activating factor and the metabolities of arachidonic acid) constitute some of this specialized machinery, and, if so, how this machinery might work.\r"

This is due in part to the limitations in the bioassay and radiometric assays but also to the fact that the development of facile techniques that are acceptable to the community both in terms of operation, sensitivity, and accuracy are attainable. It is with these latter forms of measurement that significant advances can be made in the understanding of the biosynthesis and metabolism of PAF after specific stimuli of either isolated cells, organs, or the intact organism. Recent studies using mass spectrometry have suggested that 95% of PAF administered via the airway was retained within the lung primarily in only 2 cell types: the alveolar type II cell and the nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cell (Clara cell). Further characterization of the metabolites in these lungs suggested a biochemical interconnection between PAF and arachidonate metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of white cells, including the neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, and mast cell, has long been known to be suppressed by high, nonphysiological levels of E-prostaglandins (PGE). In contrast, PGE at levels consistent with an interaction with the PGE receptor (5 X 10(-9) M) have recently been shown to suppress leukotriene (LT) and prostaglandin (PG) production by neutrophils and eosinophils. This occurs by cyclic AMP-dependent inhibition of release of substrate arachidonic acid (AA) from phospholipid pools. The additional observation that indomethacin (10(-9) M) enhances release of eicosanoids by suppressing endogenous PGE2 acting to increase cAMP levels in these cells. Theophylline and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors precisely duplicate the action of PGE2, and the combined effects of such phosphodiesterase inhibitors and adenylate cyclase stimulators are synergistic. The mechanism of action of theophylline in asthma is not know, although it is generally agreed that its effect is a direct one on the bronchial smooth muscle. The findings described in this report now permit the bronchial smooth muscle, but is primarily one of suppressing mediator release from relevant white cells by inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase, an action that is enhanced by the presence of inflammatory prostaglandins in the lung.\r"

  ".W": "The action and interaction of many products of arachidonic acid metabolism can affect the pulmonary circulation in the perinatal period. The rapid increase in pulmonary blood flow with the onset of ventilation likely is brought about to a large degree by the production locally of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2). This can be stimulated by purely mechanical factors, by the normally increasing concentrations of angiotension II, by the 02-mediated release of bradykinin, or perhaps by other phenomena. Prostaglandin D2 release from mast cells also may play some role. The opposing pulmonary vascular effect, i.e., pulmonary vasoconstriction, of leukotrienes is likely to play a role in regulating fetal pulmonary blood flow. Inhibition of the production or action of these substances will allow for vasodilatation, and it is probable that perinatal pulmonary vascular tone reflects a balance between local prostaglandin and leukotriene production.\r"

We investigated whether early and late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI are associated with changes in airway responsiveness to methacholine and airway inflammation as determined by bronchoalveolar lavage. We measured FEV1 before and at regular intervals after exposure to TDI, and performed dose-response curves to methacholine and bronchoalveolar lavage at 8 h after TDI in a group of 6 subjects with late asthmatic reactions and in 6 subjects with only early asthmatic reactions. The same procedure was followed 2 h after TDI in a group of 6 subjects with previously documented late asthmatic reactions and in a group of 6 subjects without any previously documented asthmatic reaction after TDI. In subjects with late asthmatic reactions, neutrophils were increased at both 2 and 8 h, and eosinophils and airway responsiveness were increased only at 8 h. By contrast, neutrophils, eosinophils and airway responsiveness were not increased at 8 h after TDI in subjects with an early asthmatic reaction or at 2 h after TDI in normal control subjects. These results suggest that late asthmatic reactions to TDI, and the associated increase in airway responsiveness, may be caused by airway inflammation.\r"

The mechanism of this increase in airway responsiveness is unknown. Capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerves and the tachykinins they release upon activation are important in controlling bronchomotor tone in guinea pigs. To determine whether tachykinins are important in TDI-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, we studied the effects of tachykinin depletion, using capsaicin, and competitive tachykinin antagonism, using (D-Arg1, D-Pro2, D-Trp7.9, Leu11) substance P, on TDI-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. In 9 of 9 untreated animals, TDI exposure caused a large and significant increase in airway responsiveness to acetylcholine. The mean concentration of acetylcholine required to decrease specific airway conductance by 50% below baseline (the PD50) was 1.51% before TDI exposure and 0.17% after TDI exposure (p less than 0.0005). Capsaicin treatment had no effect on the PD50 but prevented the TDI-induced increase in airway responsiveness in 10 of 12 animals. (The PD50 was 1.03% before TDI and 1.27% after TDI exposure.) Treatment with the tachykinin antagonist (D-Arg1, D-Pro2, D-Trp7.9, Leu11) substance P also abolished the TDI-induced increase in airway responsiveness in all 5 animals treated. Although TDI exposure also causes airway edema, the effect of capsaicin treatment on TDI-induced airway hyperresponsiveness did not result from prevention of airway edema. TDI exposure caused a marked increase in tracheal extravasation of intravenously administered Evans blue dye that was not prevented by capsaicin treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether these drugs would improve obstructive sleep apnea, 10 male patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (Apnea Index greater than 15/h) were given infusions of aminophylline and a saline placebo on 2 separate nights a week apart, using a randomized crossover design. There was a significant decrease during aminophylline infusion in the frequency of those apneas, which contained periods of complete respiratory inactivity (central and mixed apneas; placebo, 4.3 +/- 1.8/h; aminophylline, 0.7 +/- 0.5/h; p less than 0.05). There was no change in either the frequency (placebo, 31.8 +/- 5.9/h; aminophylline, 28.7 +/- 8.7/h; NS) or duration of obstructive apneas. Mean and minimal arterial oxygen saturation values were also unchanged. Sleep architecture was markedly disturbed by aminophylline. There was a reduction in sleep efficiency (placebo, 84.8 +/- 2.0%; aminophylline, 60.2 +/- 5.0%; p less than 0.005), an increase in sleep fragmentation (sleep stage shifts/h: placebo, 11.6 +/- 1.3: aminophylline, 21.0 +/- 2.9; p less than 0.05) and less Stage 2 and more Stage 1 non-REM sleep. We conclude that aminophylline reduces central apnea and the central component of mixed apneas but has no effect on obstructive apnea. Theophylline is therefore unlikely to be therapeutically useful in patients with OSA, and because it leads to marked sleep disruption, its long-term use could conceivably increase the propensity to upper airway occlusion during sleep.\r"

Preoperative ultrasonic imaging was performed on 15 consecutive patients prior to in situ saphenous bypass. The findings of the ultrasonic evaluations were compared with the intraoperative findings. Preoperative assessment of the greater saphenous vein was performed with a high resolution real-time B-mode ultrasonic imager. The procedure was performed with the patient seated with the leg extended. The saphenous vein was imaged starting at the ankle. A waterproof pen was used to mark the vein. The locations of valves and tributary vessels were marked and the diameter of the saphenous vein was recorded. These results were compared with operative findings. In all 15 patients, the saphenous vein was imaged. There was 100 per cent accuracy in the detection and location of valve sites. In one patient, the proximal portion of the vein was thrombosed and this was detected by the B-mode scan. There was exact correlation in 14 of 15 limbs (93%). The one error was due to the examiners' failure to identify a triple venous system; only a double venous system was identified by scan in this patient. The actual venous diameter was consistently within 0.5 mm of that measured by the ultrasound imager. In all patients, the ultrasound image demonstrated the correct anatomic location and size of the vein. In conclusion, B-mode ultrasonic imaging provides an accurate description of the anatomy of the saphenous vein, without the morbidity associated with contrast venography.\r"

Eighty patients with hyperparathyroidism underwent preoperative subtraction scintigraphy with 201Tl Cl and 99mTcO4; scan results were correlated with the operative identification and histopathology of the resected parathyroid tissue. The true-positive, false-positive and false-negative rates of these scans were compared between patients with tumors in normal and ectopic anatomic locations and between patients undergoing an initial and reoperative neck exploration. The scan was clearly valuable in patients with one or more prior neck explorations. True-positive scans were obtained in seven (77%) of nine such patients. The scan was also valuable in patients who had ectopic tumors (six mediastinal, seven intrathyroid, and two in the carotid sheath). Twelve (80%) of these 15 ectopic tumors were correctly localized either prior to their first operation or before subsequent explorations. In contrast, only 33 (50%) of 65 patients had a true-positive scan prior to their first operation and when the tumor was not in an ectopic location. In summary, in this series, the thallium-technetium scan was correct in only 50 per cent of patients undergoing an initial operation. However, it was positive in 77 per cent of patients who had at least one prior neck exploration and in 80 per cent of patients with an ectopic parathyroid tumor. These results support the selective use of this valuable imaging and localization tool.\r"

The technique for both primary closure and silastic staging is presented. The technique selected for each case should be based on intragastric pressure measurements. Results suggest that either technique can be used with low mortality and that some of the morbidity and mortality reported for silastic closure is related to adaptation of a technique developed for closure of omphalocele to gastroschisis closure, without making allowances for the different pathophysiology of the two entities.

One hundred ninety-six patients with supine diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg were treated with propranolol (80 to 240 mg twice a day) or a sustained-release preparation of diltiazem (60 to 180 mg twice a day) in a double-blind, randomized, parallel group protocol for 6 months. Hydrochlorothiazide was added for patients not achieving the treatment goal. Both agents produced nearly identical and highly significant (p less than 0.001) reductions in supine blood pressure. There were no significant differences at the end of the optional combination therapy phase, although additional reduction with hydrochlorothiazide was slightly greater in the propranolol group. Blood pressure responses in relation to age, gender, race, and smoking history showed that diltiazem produced greater changes in older subjects and women, whereas propranolol was less effective in blacks. However, these differences were not critical.\r"

  ".W": "We used decision analysis to estimate the clinical and economic implications of testing for cervical infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in women during routine gynecologic visits. We compared a strategy of no routine testing with a strategy involving the use of routine cultures or the use of less expensive rapid tests for chlamydial infection (the direct fluorescent assay or the enzyme immunoassay). We used different assumptions for the costs and operating characteristics of the diagnostic tests, complications of undetected infection, and the cost of false-positive test results. We found that using one of the rapid tests would reduce overall costs if the prevalence of infection was 7% or greater. The use of routine cultures would reduce costs if the frequency of infection was 14% or greater. We conclude that testing for cervical infection with C. trachomatis in women seeking routine gynecologic care may reduce overall costs. The choice of diagnostic test should depend on the expected prevalence of infection, local cost considerations, and laboratory expertise in the execution of these tests.\r"

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins depend on the presence of preformed allergic (IgE) antibodies to several penicillin determinants. These materials can be used in in-vivo skin testing to exclude those patients at risk for immediate or accelerated allergic reactions. The cephalosporins have not had their relevant determinants defined as related to allergic reactions. The results of in-vivo challenges of patients with IgE to penicillin suggest the incidence of reactivity of cephalosporins in patients allergic to penicillin is less than generally appreciated. The monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic, aztreonam (a monobactam), failed to show cross-reactivity with penicillin antibodies, because immune reactivity toward the monobactam was directed against side chain rather than nuclear determinants. On the other hand, the new bicyclic carbapenem beta-lactam drugs, represented by imipenem, showed extensive in-vivo cross-reactivity with penicillins.\r"

  ".U": "87268980\r", 
  ".W": "Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) stems from the demonstration that the membrane glycoprotein, CD4, is the cellular receptor for HIV. This glycoprotein is found mainly on the surface of a major subpopulation of T lymphocytes and also on macrophages, natural killer cells, some B lymphocytes, and neuronal cells. Cells infected with HIV may be destroyed or have their normal function impaired. Host immune responses to HIV are poor and are not sustained. Neutralizing antibody often is not produced, or HIV may escape from normal immunosuppressive mechanisms through the process of rapid antigenic variation. Factors and markers that may be important in the outcome or that may predict progression of HIV infection are genetic (Gc type), environmental (nutritional status or intercurrent sexually transmitted diseases sustained by the host), and immunologic (rate of decline in number and impairment of function of CD4 lymphocytes and of decline in antibody titers to HIV core protein, p24). A recombinant vaccine will probably be developed for testing in future clinical trials.\r"

In addition, five intraosseous ES biopsies from patients undergoing translabyrinthine acoustic neuroma resection were studied using the immunoperoxidase technique to identify specific leukocyte subpopulations. Evidence of phagocytic activity included the presence of phagocytic epithelial cells, monocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Immune surveillance was suggested by intraepithelial and subepithelial T-lymphocytes, numerous fenestrated blood vessels, and the presence of a homogeneously staining substance within the lumina of ES epithelial tubules. No B-lymphocytes were found. The findings support the existence of a local immune system of the normal human inner ear.\r"

The diet combines the administration of a glyceryl trioleate oil (GTO) with the dietary restriction of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLFA), particularly hexacosanoic acid (C26:0). Reductions in the levels of plasma C26:0 and other VLFA were achieved in 25 of the 36 patients. Fifteen of these 25 patients were treated for more than 100 days. The mean reduction of the plasma C26:0 level was 53% (range, 22 to 73%) in these 15 patients. While the focus of the study was on biochemical variables, comparison of pre- and post-diet studies of peripheral nerve function showed improvement in 1 patient with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) and 1 heterozygote. In contrast, 2 patients with ALD onset in childhood developed new neurological deficits while on therapy. We conclude that it is possible to lower plasma VLFA levels in ALD patients. A clinical trial is indicated to test whether this approach can alter the neurological progression in patients with AMN or in symptomatic heterozygotes, and to determine whether it can prevent the onset of neurological disability in asymptomatic persons who have the biochemical defect of ALD.\r"

The effect of a low dose (0.0075 mg/kg/day) was no different from that of a high dose (0.015 mg/kg/day); children's responses were no different from adults'; and those also receiving neuroleptic agents showed the same lack of efficacy as seen in patients on no other medication.

Abnormal results in two or more of these tests indicate autonomic dysfunction. Intraarterial catheterization and tests of vasomotor function are usually required only in doubtful cases or for research purposes. Treatment of autonomic dysfunction is focused primarily on bladder control and control of orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension is best treated with physical measures, pharmacologically with 9-alpha-fluorohydrocortisone and dihydroergotamine mesylate.

In normal subjects, there was a striking rise in EPI, NE, beta-endorphin, and ACTH following the nadir of hypoglycemia. Both beta-endorphin and ACTH responses were significantly lower than normal in patients with MSA, in contrast to normal levels in IOH patients. No correlation was observed between the degree of adrenergic insufficiency and the beta-endorphin and ACTH responses. The normal peptide responses in IOH are consistent with involvement limited to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, whereas lesions in the central nervous system in MSA interfere with release of beta-endorphin and ACTH in response to hypoglycemia. The strong correlation between beta-endorphin and ACTH levels is consistent with their common origin. Peripheral adrenergic activity is not essential for beta-endorphin and ACTH release in humans.\r"

Using rabbit antisera raised against hamster scrapie prion proteins (HaPrPSc), we identified by immunoblotting human CJD prion proteins (HuPrPCJD) in the brains of 14 patients dying of CJD. Extracts from 6 of the patients were transmitted to mice after prolonged incubation. The rabbit antisera raised against HaPrPSc also reacted with the mouse CJD prion proteins (MoPrPCJD) found in the brains of these experimentally infected mice. When mice were immunized with HuPrPCJD, they produced antibodies that reacted with HuPrPCJD but not with MoPrPCJD. Mice immunized with MoPrPCJD produced antibodies to neither murine nor human prion proteins. Our results provide evidence for host species-specific epitopes on prion proteins. The existence of such epitopes is consistent with the apparent lack of an immune response during prion infections and the finding that prion protein molecules are encoded by host genes.\r"

In these mutants, no increased production of beta-lactamase was detectable. No apparent differences between the resistant mutants and the parental strains were observed in the affinity of E-0702 for penicillin-binding proteins. Furthermore, no significant reduction in or loss of both OmpF and OmpC porin proteins in the outer membrane was observed. The mutation was mapped to the tonB gene, which is known to be essential for the iron transport system of bacteria. The bactericidal action of E-0702 was rapidly expressed against iron-starved cells in which the iron transport system was induced, whereas the bactericidal action against iron-supplemented cells was ineffective. It is suggested that E-0702 is incorporated into bacterial cells as a chelator of iron via the tonB-dependent iron transport system, after which its strong and rapid bactericidal action is manifested.\r"

Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates.

The action of C12-Im on Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described in this report. C12-Im prevented growth of colonies when present in 1% yeast extract-2% Bacto-Peptone-2% glucose plates at concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or above, or when present in a soft agar overlay at 20 micrograms/ml. Treatment of cells suspended in glucose-containing buffer (pH 8.0, 37 degrees C) with C12-Im (6 micrograms/ml) caused greater than 95% cell death within 6 min. Dependence of killing on C12-Im concentration was sigmoidal, suggesting a cooperative mode of action. Killing was pH dependent, being much more effective at pH 8.0 than at pH 5.0. Ammonium sulfate and imidazole protected against killing if added before, but not after, the addition of C12-Im. Sensitivity to C12-Im was strongly growth dependent: the cells were most sensitive at early to mid-logarithmic phase of growth and became progressively less sensitive during progression through late logarithmic and stationary phase. Vacuolar disruption by C12-Im was demonstrated by using cells loaded with lucifer yellow CH or fluoresceinated dextran in their vacuoles; vacuoles of logarithmically growing cells were more sensitive than those of stationary-phase cells. These results suggest that vacuolar disruption by C12-Im may underlie its cytotoxic effects.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the influence of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic regimen on the antibacterial effect in vivo, we compared three cephalosporins, cefotiam, cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone, in a rabbit model of experimental Escherichia coli endocarditis after 4 days of treatment. The MBCs of cefotiam, cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone for the E. coli strain were 0.5, 0.125, and 0.06 microgram/ml, respectively. Killing curves at 10 times the MBC were similar for the three cephalosporins. In serum, the elimination half-life of ceftriaxone was twice as much as the elimination half-life of cefotiam or cefmenoxime (2.8 +/- 0.45 versus 1.4 +/- 0.25 or 1.3 +/- 0.4 h, respectively). Ceftriaxone was much more effective than cefotiam. The bacterial titer in the vegetations (log10 CFU per gram of vegetation) was 7.56 +/- 1 with cefotiam and 2.41 +/- 2.6 with ceftriaxone, as their concentrations were 18 and 466 times higher, respectively, than their MBCs. Although ceftriaxone and cefmenoxime exhibited a similar rate of killing and percentage of protein binding, ceftriaxone was more effective than cefmenoxime at the same regimen of 15 mg/kg twice a day (3.08 +/- 1.1 versus 4.82 +/- 3.2 log10 CFU/g of vegetation). When antibiotic was given as a single daily injection of 30 mg/kg, the antibacterial effect persisted for ceftriaxone, but not for cefmenoxime. The longer elimination half-life and the higher local concentration/MBC ratio of ceftriaxone explained these results. The bacterial titer measured 24 h after the fourth injection of 30 mg of ceftriaxone per kg confirmed that this regimen prevented regrowth of bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The absolute concentrations needed for inhibition of conjugation varied from 0.12 microgram/ml for ciprofloxacin to 16 micrograms/ml for pipemidic acid, but the relationship to the MICs for the parent strains was identical for all substrates. Concentrations for a 90% reduction of transconjugants were in the range of one to six times the MIC for the parent strains, which also had lethal effects on donors and recipients. A similar effect on conjugation was found with chloramphenicol. These observations question the specificity of transfer inhibition by quinolones and cast doubt on the clinical importance of such an effect.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-four cancer patients at risk of infection because of neutropenia were randomized to receive nalidixic acid as an alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for infection prophylaxis. Infections were documented significantly earlier and more often among patients who entered the trial with neutrophil counts of less than 0.1 X 10(9)/liter. TMP-SMX recipients experienced fewer microbiologically documented infections and bacteremias and were free of infection for a higher proportion of days with severe neutropenia (less than 0.1 X 10(9)/liter) than nalidixic acid recipients. Gram-negative bacillary and Staphylococcus aureus infections accounted for the major differences. Although the majority of aerobic gram-negative bacilli were eliminated from the feces after 1 week of prophylaxis with either agent, TMP-SMX was proved superior to nalidixic acid in this regard and was associated with acquired drug resistance by gram-negative bacilli less frequently. Both agents selected for colonization and subsequent infection by gram-positive cocci. Our data suggest that prophylaxis is most likely to be effective if administered to patients for at least 1 week before they become severely neutropenic. Nalidixic acid used as a single agent in doses of 4 g daily, however, cannot be recommended as an alternative to TMP-SMX for infection prophylaxis in neutropenic cancer patients.\r"

The effect of continuous administration of small doses of ampicillin, chlortetracycline, or streptomycin in the drinking water was studied in gnotobiotic mice inoculated with a human fecal flora. In this animal model, which is free of many interfering factors, an increase in the fecal concentration of resistant E. coli was observed when the mice were given 0.5 microgram of ampicillin or chlortetracycline per ml of water. This model is therefore a sensitive system for testing the effect of antimicrobial drugs on the resistance characteristics of the intestinal flora.\r"

Kinetic analysis of the (rA)n X (dT)12-18 (a standard template primer complex of polyriboadenylate and oligodeoxythymidylate of indicated length)-directed reaction revealed that erythro-AZT-TP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to dTTP, whereas threo-AZT-TP was a noncompetitive inhibitor. The apparent Ki values, as calculated from Dixon plots, were 0.48 and 5.5 microM, respectively, compared with a Km value for dTTP of about 70 microM. These results indicate that erythro-AZT-TP had an approximately 150-times-higher affinity to the enzyme than dTTP had and that the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase had different binding sites for the two isomers.\r"

Intubation with C. albicans in the absence of antibiotics resulted in the induction of low but detectable delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), demonstrable by footpad testing with a C. albicans wall glycoprotein (GP), and in the stimulation of a moderate level of protective immunity, demonstrable by intravenous (i.v.) challenge. DTH to a membrane extract, BEX, could not be detected in such animals. However, animals colonized in the presence of antibiotics and then inoculated cutaneously prior to being tested for DTH or protective immunity developed significantly enhanced levels of DTH to GP and BEX and were protected to an even greater extent than animals colonized in the absence of antibiotics who were not inoculated cutaneously. The priming effect of colonization, particularly with respect to the antigen GP, was also obvious from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for GP-specific antibody with sera of mice surviving the i.v. challenge, in that GP-specific antibody was present in the highest titers in colonized animals that had been inoculated cutaneously prior to i.v. challenge. While the antibiotics promoted higher levels of colonization, as evidenced by stomach and fecal cultures of intubated mice, antibiotic administration was not necessary for the induction of C. albicans-specific responses. Moreover, contrary to reports in the literature, antibiotic administration had no adverse effect on the immune responses measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin following single oral doses of 500 and 750 mg in 32 patients with various degrees of renal function impairment were investigated in an open, randomized crossover fashion. Ciprofloxacin was administered after overnight fasting; the washout time between the two doses was 1 week. Serum and urine samples were collected serially between 0 and 24 h and subjected to bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed, assuming an open two-compartment model with first-order input and elimination. A distinct difference was observed in pharmacokinetic parameters between patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance, less than 50 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and those with normal renal function (creatinine clearance, greater than or equal to 50 ml/min per 1.73 m2). For the former group, the area under the curve of serum concentration versus time was doubled, the renal clearance of ciprofloxacin was cut to one-fourth, the total and nonrenal ciprofloxacin clearance was reduced by 50%, and the elimination half-life was prolonged by a factor of approximately 1.7. The correlation between renal drug clearance and creatinine clearance was highly significant (r = 0.890; P less than 0.001). On the basis of these findings, it appears that a 50% dose reduction of ciprofloxacin in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance, less than 50 ml/min per 1.73 m2) may be indicated to achieve concentrations in serum similar to those observed in normal individuals. As the concentration of ciprofloxacin in urine after 24 h remained above the MIC for most urinary pathogens, this drug appears to be of potential benefit for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with impaired renal function.\r"

Under conditions of high stringency, no cross hybridization could be detected with DNA probes from within the open reading frame of the OXA-2 structural gene. At a lower stringency, one of two DNA fragments used as probes cross hybridized weakly with the OXA-3 bla gene. Other DNA fragments tested and known to contain sequences flanking the OXA-2 determinant cross hybridized with OXA-3 and PSE-4 plasmid DNA. From the known nucleotide sequence of OXA-2 and TEM-1, we synthesized a series of oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences internal to their respective structural genes. A 12-mer oligonucleotide containing the OXA-2-active-site nucleotide sequences cross hybridized only with OXA-3. All other oligonucleotides tested were found to be specific for their respective OXA-2 or TEM-1 gene. Such beta-lactamase gene probes should facilitate studies of beta-lactamase molecular epidemiology and beta-lactamase gene polymorphism.\r"

Exposure to serum complement increased the surface hydrophobicity of a K- strain but failed to interact or to increase the surface hydrophobicity of the K+ strains. However, after growth of the K+ strains in sub-MICs of the antibiotics, complement increased their surface hydrophobicity and complement C3 was detected bound to their surface. Antisera raised against a K-O- strain agglutinated the K+ strains grown in the presence but not in the absence of cefuroxime or ciprofloxacin. These findings suggest that the filamentous morphology induced by these antibiotics influences the distribution or amount of capsular polysaccharide such that cell envelope components previously masked by the capsule become accessible to complement and immunoglobulins.\r"

ATP was then assayed by using the firefly bioluminescence technique. Rifampin, clofazimine, and ethionamide each effected a significantly accelerated rate of ATP decay compared with controls. Dapsone appeared inactive, possibly reflecting a general insensitivity of this system to compounds acting at certain loci. The system appeared suitable for assessing comparative activity of new structural analogs of clofazimine. Other active compounds included erythromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, gramicidin, and, to a lesser extent, cycloserine, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and gramicidin S. The penicillins, bacitracin, isoniazid, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, polymyxin B, and griseofulvin were all inactive. The system appears sensitive to agents with various modes of action and may prove useful as a primary screen for antileprosy drugs.\r"

They were also resistant to ampicillin and streptomycin, and some were resistant to tetracycline and potassium tellurite. All the strains transferred trimethoprim and ampicillin resistance to E. coli. Analysis of the donors and of the transconjugants by agarose gel electrophoresis after digestion by restriction endonucleases and by nucleic acid hybridization indicated that resistance to trimethoprim (dfrI) and to ampicillin (bla TEM-1) was mediated by a 65-kilobase plasmid, pIP1531. Persistence of resistance to trimethoprim and ampicillin in this flock was therefore due to two cumulative factors, both occurring in the absence of selective pressure, namely the dissemination of a particular plasmid between strains and the ability of an atypical E. coli strain to stably colonize many animals.\r"

Various fungi, including Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Aspergillus niger, survived 30- to 60-min interactions with these disinfectant solutions. The most resistant organism encountered was Aspergillus fumigatus, which survived 60 and even 90 min of exposure to most disinfectants.

All subjects were given a standard test for hypnotizability. Assuming that the results were not biased by their preceding relaxation sessions, we determined that six subjects were hypnotizable and nine were nonhypnotizable. Subjects in both groups improved symptomatically, but hypnotizable subjects had fewer hives and became more symptomatic during the control (testing and history taking) session. Hypnotizable subjects also more frequently related stress as a causative factor. At a follow-up examination five to 14 months after the completion of the experimental sessions, six patients were free of hives and an additional seven reported improvement.\r"

Patients gradually or abruptly develop severe pain, extensive edema, and cyanosis of the extremity, nearly always in the legs. Gangrene can occur unless the venous obstruction is relieved. Such ischemic venous thrombosis can complicate surgery, trauma, childbirth, or prolonged immobility, but malignant neoplasms, either obvious or occult, are a major predisposing factor. The optimal therapy is anticoagulation and thrombectomy. Patients with venous gangrene may require amputation if extensive, deep-tissue destruction occurs. The mortality rate for ischemic venous thrombosis is about 40%, the cause of death usually being the underlying disease or pulmonary emboli.\r"

Diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux was made by measurement of intraluminal oesophageal pH combined with manometry. Oesophagitis was assessed in all patients by histological examination of mucosal specimens taken during oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Manometry, pH test, and endoscopy with biopsy examination were repeated at the end of the treatment period. Seventeen patients completed the trial, eight of whom were taking the drug and nine the placebo. Mean total clinical score and post-prandial reflux time (% of reflux) significantly improved in patients in the group given Cisapride but not in the group given placebo. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement of the histological oesophagitis score only in the children in the group given Cisapride, whereas placebo was ineffective. It is concluded that Cisapride is a useful agent both for the relief of symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux and for the healing of peptic oesophagitis in infancy.\r"

High-resolution intraoperative ultrasonography of the CBD and a conventional intraoperative cholangiogram were performed to detect the presence and number of stones. The results of these two tests were evaluated independently by two ultrasonographers and two surgeons. There were 21 true-positive and five false-negative readings by sonogram compared with 17 and 9, respectively, by cholangiogram. Sensitivity of the sonogram was 81% and 65.4% by cholangiogram. Score of accuracy was 1.06 and 1.62 by cholangiogram and 0.81 and 0.87 by ultrasound (p less than 0.05).

The increase in diameter of the main vein during Valsalva maneuver was considered to quantitatively represent venous reflux. The data obtained were correlated with pre- and postoperative clinical findings. This method of evaluation proved to be a useful noninvasive diagnostic modality for detecting varicocele and for assessing treatment results. On the basis of venous diameters and reflux values, a classification of varicocele is proposed. Such an objective method of grading would eliminate the subjective impression and interpretation factors of the examiner.\r"

Reduced platelet numbers and abnormal platelet function may contribute to postoperative bleeding. A membrane oxygenator may preserve platelets and reduce bleeding more than a bubble oxygenator, and the antiplatelet agent dipyridamole may protect platelets intraoperatively and reduce bleeding postoperatively. A prospective randomized trial was performed in 44 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting to assess the effects of the membrane oxygenator and dipyridamole on platelet counts, platelet activation products, and postoperative bleeding. Patients who were randomized to receive a bubble oxygenator and no dipyridamole had the lowest postoperative platelet counts, the greatest blood loss, and the most blood products transfused. Platelet counts were highest and blood loss was least in patients randomized to receive a membrane oxygenator and dipyridamole (p less than .05). A bubble oxygenator with dipyridamole and a membrane oxygenator without dipyridamole resulted in intermediate postoperative platelet counts and blood loss. Arterial thromboxane B2 and platelet factor 4 concentrations were elevated on cardiopulmonary bypass in all groups. Both the membrane oxygenator and dipyridamole were independently effective (by multivariate analysis) in preserving platelets. Optimal blood conservation was achieved with a membrane oxygenator and dipyridamole.\r"

There was marked variability in the initial serum transaminase levels; however, 16 patients had aspartate aminotransferase levels greater than 300 IU, and 19 patients had alanine aminotransferase values greater than 300 IU. Regardless of the initial values, there was a 76% (aspartate aminotransferase) and 58% (alanine aminotransferase) reduction in transaminase levels within 72 hours, prior to therapeutic relief of bile duct obstruction. In ten patients with common bile duct obstruction, cholescintigraphy revealed no excretion of technetium Tc-99m-labeled iminodiacetic acid, for up to two hours after injection, into the extrahepatic biliary tract or small bowel. Common bile duct stones were present in 16 patients, five patients had acute pancreatitis, and four patients were thought to have spontaneously passed common duct stones. We believe that high transaminase levels may be found in patients with obstructive biliary tract disease, sequential measurements of transaminase levels may provide an important diagnostic clue for biliary tract disease, and nonexcretion of radionuclide on cholescintigraphy may be a feature of acute bile duct obstruction.\r"

The diminution in the flow of saliva may profoundly affect oral health, disturb digestion and speech, and seriously impair the patient's quality of life. Food avoidance, nonabsorption of sublingually placed drugs, and noncompliance with medication may also result. Sialometry can be used to confirm the presence of dry mouth.

  ".W": "Many of the new technologies that have developed as a result of advances in cellular and molecular biology, genetics, and immunology have had a major impact in clinical medicine and will continue to provide important diagnostic and investigative tools in the future. The ability to localize a wide variety of gene products in tissues has been accomplished largely through the use of immunohistochemistry. Characterization of gene expression at the levels of specific messenger RNAs and genomic DNAs is now possible through the use of both blot and in situ hybridization techniques. These molecular biological technologies provide important new approaches for understanding the pathobiology of disease and for providing more objective and rational diagnostic and prognostic criteria in biopsy specimens. The pathologist is in a unique position to coordinate, implement, and lead efforts utilizing these new methods for the study of human disease. In addition, the pathologist must assume a leadership role in the assessment of the efficacies of the new technologies in resolving specific clinical problems and in providing novel approaches for clinical and basic research.\r"

This deformity produces motor imbalance with the triceps overpowering the elbow flexors, thus impeding volitional elbow flexion. The nature of the deformity was defined by electromyography of the muscle groups about the elbow, which demonstrated out-of-phase inhibitory electrical activity of the triceps muscle. Treatment consisted of V-Y lengthening of the triceps muscle to achieve agonist-antagonist motor balance. The operation improved hand placement for all three patients.\r"

Cornea and aqueous humor samples were obtained and assayed by radioimmunoassay for gentamicin. In the topical group, the average gentamicin levels in the cornea and aqueous were 16.2 micrograms/g and 0.3 microgram/mL, respectively. Parenteral drug levels were less variable and averaged 6.1 micrograms/g in the cornea and 0.4 microgram/mL in the aqueous. Although this study demonstrates that parenteral therapy can be used to deliver adequate drug levels to the cornea, it requires far more antibiotic and subjects the patient to potentially toxic systemic side effects. Therefore, topical administration is the preferred route of delivery of antibiotic to the cornea.\r"

Eleven consecutive patients from a mixed referral population with functionally disabling astigmatism were studied. The average preoperative keratometric cylinder of 11.68 diopters was reduced by 7.95 (+/- 3.03 SD) diopters. Each patient's net keratometric cylinder was reduced. We believe that this technique is safer and more predictable than previously published techniques.\r"

One ear was randomly chosen for intubation with a gold-plated tube, and a Teflon tube was inserted into the other ear. Patients were examined monthly for 12 months and evaluated for otorrhea, tube occlusion, and early tube extrusion. Although the incidence of otorrhea and tube occlusion were higher for the gold-plated tube, these differences were not statistically significant. The gold-plated tube had a significantly higher rate of early extrusion than the Teflon tube. Based on these findings, there appears to be no advantage to using gold-plated tubes for middle-ear ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "This presentation has covered, in part, the subject of fibroblasts or parenchymal cell adhesion to biomaterials and the manipulation of biomaterial surfaces by appropriate biologic coatings from the viewpoint of the biologist. A tissue culture laboratory with good biochemical instrumentation can contribute greatly to the understanding of biomaterial-cell interactions. Such a laboratory cannot only test the toxicity of polymers, but can also proceed with systematic investigations of the role of synthetic and biologic substrates in favoring non-transformed cell attachment, improving cell spreading, and prolonging the life in vitro of normal cell constituents from a diversity of human tissues or organs. Yet, there are certain questions about the biomaterial-tissue interactions that will only be answered by in vivo experiments, since in vitro data may or may not predict the in vivo attachment of a particular cell in a highly protein-competitive environment. One important, albeit neglected, fact is that the early deposition of a protein/glycoprotein/lipid layer from serum, plasma, or peritoneal fluid will modify any synthetic surface introduced into the body. Baier called this early step \"interface conversion,\" and it is quite clear that the shape, surface contamination, and physiochemical properties of the synthetic substratum triggers many events that take place during this \"interface conversion.\" Many investigators have tried to explain cell behavior in vitro by manipulating polymer surface charges, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, physical and chemical anisotropy, and/or substrate contractility. We believe that new biomaterial surface coatings will be available as soon as new methods of extraction from biomatrices or extracellular matrices become more familiar. These new coatings will probably promote attachment in more specific terms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rapid onset of sedation was seen after midazolam, while the pattern and duration of postoperative sedation, as measured by standard psychometric tests, indicated slower recovery after midazolam than after diazepam. Ratings by the surgeon indicated superior anxiolysis following midazolam and significantly more patients expressed a preference for oral midazolam sedation. Significant, comparable anterograde amnesia was seen with both treatments. No significant cardiovascular complications occurred with either treatment. The findings indicate that rapidly acting oral benzodiazepines such as midazolam provide safe, effect alternatives to i.v. diazepam for conscious sedation in outpatients undergoing minor surgical procedures.\r"

  ".U": "87272062\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the potential of photoradiation therapy for the in vitro purging of residual tumor cells from autologous bone marrow (BM) transplants, we studied normal marrow and tumor cell clonogenicity in response to different light-activated compounds by using the fluorescent dyes dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE) and merocyanine-540 (MC-540). After photoradiation of cells with white light, both DHE and MC-540 showed high cytocidal activity toward lymphoid and myeloid neoplastic cells but had a significantly lesser effect on normal granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E), and mixed colony-forming (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), non-B, non-T, CALLA-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Reh), and diffuse histocytic B cell lymphoma (SK-DHL-2) cell lines were exposed to different drug concentrations in combination with white light at a constant illumination rate of 50,000 lux. With DHE doses varying from 2.0 to 2.5 micrograms/mL and MC-540 concentrations of 15 to 20 micrograms/mL, clonogenic tumor cells could be reduced by more than 4 logs when treated alone or in mixtures with normal irradiated human marrow cells. However, preferential cytotoxicity towards neoplastic cells was highly dependent on the mode of light activation. MC-540 had no substantial effect on malignant lymphoid (SK-DHL-2) and myeloid (HL-60) cells and on normal marrow myeloid (CFU-GM) precursors when drug incubation was performed in the dark and followed by light exposure of washed cells. Equal doses of MC-540 (15 to 20 micrograms/mL) could preferentially eliminate tumor cells under conditions of simultaneous light and drug treatment (30 minutes at 37 degrees C). When using DHE (2.5 micrograms/mL), 29.3%, 46.8%, and 27.5% of normal marrow CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM, respectively, were spared after sequential drug and light exposure of cells, whereas simultaneous treatment reduced both normal (CFU-GM) and neoplastic cells below the limits of detection. In summary, our results indicate the usefulness of various photoradiation models for the ex vivo treatment of leukemic and lymphomatous bone marrow autografts.\r"

  ".W": "To gain insight into the mammalian liver to kidney erythropoietin (Ep) switch, we heterotopically transplanted livers from preswitch, switched, and postswitch fetal and newborn lambs into normal adult sheep. Recipients' serum Ep and circulating reticulocyte levels were serially determined until rejection of the graft and compared with identical samples from sham-operated control adult ewes. Transplantation of preswitch and switched fetal livers caused an impressive rise in recipients' serum Ep activity and provoked a corresponding increase in reticulocytosis. In contrast, Ep activity and reticulocyte counts did not change from preoperative levels in adult ewes transplanted with postswitch livers or in the sham-operated controls. The production of Ep by the preswitch fetal liver in the adult environment was not dependent on the presence or absence of host kidneys and was stimulated by anemic hypoxia. These results suggest that the fetal liver is capable of producing relatively large amounts of Ep activity, and the production of Ep can be maintained in the adult environment in the presence of functional adult kidneys. This argues against suppression of liver Ep production by renal Ep, or some other factor in the postnatal environment, and suggests that the liver to kidney switch of Ep production during ontogeny may represent a genetically determined event.\r"

Significant clinical improvements were seen with each regimen and these were indistinguishable between treatments. However, chloroquine had less impact on haemoglobin, ESR, rheumatoid factor levels and C-reactive protein than the other treatments. Furthermore, radiological deterioration was most frequent amongst those given chloroquine alone. Combination treatment with D-penicillamine and chloroquine thus offered no advantages.

The visual acuity also initially improved in ten patients and this was maintained in seven cases until the dose of CyA was reduced. At this time, acuity was unchanged in two patients and was worse in three others-two of the latter as a result of vitreous haemorrhage in the absence of active inflammation. Seven of the 12 patients had therapy stopped because of complications; severe malaise and nausea (three cases), decreased renal function (three cases), and blindness (one case).

Resection can frequently be avoided and in fit patients dilatation should be combined with an anti-reflux operation plus gastroplasty where necessary. Frail elderly patients may be managed by continued dilatation and medical means to reduce and combat the effects of reflux. Resection should now be necessary in only about 5 per cent of patients and colonic interposition offers good long-term results. It must be remembered that adenocarcinoma is a small but real risk in patients with reflux stricture.\r"

They were classified according to the scan results into 12 high risk subjects with greater than 75 per cent stenosis of an internal carotid artery, 37 low risk subjects with a less than 75 per cent stenosis and 6 with no detectable stenosis. The mean duration of follow-up was 3 years (minimum 2 years) or until stroke or death. One was lost to follow-up and four were excluded having undergone carotid endarterectomy during the study. Six of twelve subjects with greater than 75 per cent stenosis suffered a stroke (five fatal and one non-fatal). There were no premonitory signs except in one patient with non-focal cerebral ischaemia for 2 months before an hemispheric stroke. There was one fatal stroke in the less than 75 per cent stenosis group and none in the control group. In all, 17 (28 per cent) patients died (myocardial infarction, 8; stroke, 6; malignant disease, 3). These results confirm that asymptomatic carotid murmurs are associated with increased mortality with most having non-severe carotid disease on duplex scanning and few strokes during follow-up. There is an important minority with tight carotid stenosis who carry a worrying risk of stroke if left untreated.\r"

In those patients who could perform exercise tests there was a significant correlation between maximum walking distance and limb blood flow (r = 0.35, P = 0.02). Resting, post-exercise and post-hyperaemic ankle-brachial systolic pressure indices bore no relationship to the maximum walking distance. Isotope limb blood flow measurement is reproducible (r = 0.97), can be applied to those patients who cannot walk on a treadmill and provides information about both legs. It correlated significantly with all the other tests and can be recommended for the minimally invasive assessment of intermittent claudication.\r"

By the third week of treatment blood pressure in the actively treated group had decreased significantly compared with that in the placebo group, though the decrease reached its maximum after 15 weeks. Urinary potassium excretion increased significantly in the group who received potassium supplements, but no significant changes were found in plasma sodium and potassium concentrations or in urinary sodium excretion. In a subgroup of 13 patients who underwent a further nine weeks of treatment with oral potassium supplements at half of the previous dose (24 mmol daily) their blood pressure, at the end of this second study period, was still significantly lower compared with their baseline value but not with that of the placebo group. These results show that moderate oral potassium supplements are associated with a long term reduction in blood pressure in patients who have mild hypertension.\r"

Before entry into the study all patients had had stable intraocular pressure (IOP) with treatment with 0.5% timolol and 2% pilocarpine. Stable IOP was successfully maintained in up to 88% of the patients in the two levobunolol-pilocarpine groups and in 83% of those in the timolol-pilocarpine group. Two patients experienced adverse reactions: one, who received timolol and pilocarpine, suffered blepharoconjunctivitis, and the other, who received 1% levobunolol and pilocarpine, experienced bradycardia.

Of the 58 babies from whom swabs were obtained, 20 had GBS at one or more sites; the transmission rate was therefore 34%. Early-onset GBS disease developed in one infant. Two infants died within the first month; however, death was not directly attributable to GBS. Higher rates of preterm delivery and of low birth weight were noted among the babies of the colonized women than among the babies of all women admitted for labour and delivery in 1985. Given the low rate of GBS disease in our centre, we suggest that emphasis be placed on GBS as a possible source of obstetric complications such as preterm labour.\r"

A total of 8140 patients at low genetic risk were screened. Patient acceptance was excellent. Blood samples were taken at 16 to 18 weeks' gestation. If the MSAFP level was elevated, the assay was repeated and an ultrasound examination performed. Amniocentesis was offered to 67 women with unexplained persistently elevated levels. The outcome of pregnancy was known in 7473 patients (91.8%). Seven of nine known open fetal neural tube defects were detected. All were confirmed, and no unaffected fetuses were aborted on the basis of the screening results. The rates of perinatal death (6.7%), intrauterine growth retardation (11.7%) and prematurity (23.3%) were significantly higher among the patients with unexplained elevated MSAFP levels than among those with normal levels (p less than 0.001). Of 20 patients with unexplained low levels, 10 subsequently had spontaneous abortions and 10 gave birth to term appropriate-for-gestational-age infants. Seven of nine patients who gave birth to infants with autosomal trisomy had MSAFP values below the median. The findings indicate that MSAFP screening is feasible, accurate and acceptable in a low-risk area.\r"

We sent a pamphlet that explained the program to 1568 people who had undergone apheresis and asked them to reply, stating their interest. At the same time the pamphlets and a poster were placed in the blood donor clinic. We received 1232 replies (78.6%) from the apheresis donors, 838 (68.0%) of which indicated a willingness to attend information sessions. Of the 7158 people who gave blood during the 3-month study period, 225 (3.1%) were interested. At the time this paper was written 47 information sessions had been held, and 721 people had attended, 624 (86.5%) of whom had signed a consent form. This indicates a clear interest in a bone marrow donation program. We believe that the ethical issues are overcome by requesting the donation before identification of any patient. From our experience a national registry of unrelated donors seems feasible, and steps are being taken to implement such a program.\r"

Localization of NSE in seminoma cells was demonstrated immunohistochemically. Only six of 40 (15%) patients with metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors showed elevated serum NSE levels. AFP and HCG were both positive in 70% of patients in this group, and NSE determination gave no additional information. Serum NSE concentrations were normal in 53 of 54 testicular cancer patients after orchiectomy and there was no evidence of metastatic disease; only one had borderline NSE levels, indicating the specificity of serum NSE determination. NSE is a new marker of seminoma and its measurement may be of clinical value in monitoring chemotherapy in patients with metastatic seminoma.\r"

Seven patients were male and four female; ages ranged from 26 to 83 years. Two male patients had documented pernicious anemia and one female patient had unconfirmed pernicious anemia. All patients had marked gastric intestinal metaplasia (atrophic gastritis), which was predominantly fundal (Type A) in three patients with suspected/proven pernicious anemia and antral (Type B) in the other eight. In seven patients, the tumors were typical carcinoids, whereas in 4 patients the carcinoids were \"atypical\"; one carcinoid was completely polypoid. All cases were argyrophilic, and focal mucin positivity was present in four. Focal somatostatin immunoreactivity was present in four cases, serotonin in three cases, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in two cases, and gastrin (G) in one case. Endocrine cell hyperplasia was identified in the gastric mucosa of eight of 11 patients, including all cases with pernicious anemia; in three of eight cases, G-cell hyperplasia was evident. Numbers of serotonin-positive cells were increased in areas of intestinal metaplasia in all cases. In two patients, there was marked endocrine-cell hyperplasia with multiple small carcinoid tumorlets; the tumorlets stained for G in one. Gastric intestinal metaplasia includes intestinal-like endocrine cells. An association exists between atrophic gastritis and gastric carcinoids, and there is a histogenetic link between atrophic gastritis and some cases of gastric carcinoid tumor.\r"

The pseudoglands were most often derived from the dilatation of bile canaliculi (28/39). The dilated canaliculi were sometimes connected and divided a cell trabecula to give a pseudopapillary appearance. A second type was concerned with tumor cell necrosis and subsequent pseudoglandular formation (6/39). A rare variant similar to papillary carcinoma was also seen in this group. Third, five cases showed microglandular formation in an scirrhous environment thereby resembling cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic adenocarcinomas. Despite these confusing features, the overall tumor histologic features, in particular the existence of a characteristic trabecular growth pattern made it possible to determine all of the cases as HCC. The importance of noticing these variable manifestations of HCC is yet emphasized in regard to differential diagnosis of hepatic tumors. The glandular elements seen in two cases of combined HCC and cholangiocarcinoma differed in that they were positive for mucin staining. In addition, the tumor cells contained mucin-positive intracytoplasmic vacuoles similar to those observed in common mucin producing adenocarcinomas.\r"

Seventeen with no evidence of lymph node involvement in whom tumor resection was complete (Group 1) received no further antitumor therapy. One child died postoperatively; disease recurred in the bone marrow of one child at 52 months, the child subsequently died. Fifteen were alive without disease, giving an 82% actuarial five year survival. Forty-eight children with minimal residual tumor and/or regional lymph node involvement (Group 2) received two 5-day courses of Peptichemio (1.2 mg/kg/d) and the 29 children in this group who were older than 1 year of age at diagnosis were randomized to receive either radiotherapy to the tumor bed in addition or no radiotherapy. In Group 2, ten of the 48 have relapsed: six of 17 with initial lymph node involvement, three of four with tumor rupture at operation, and one of eight with tumor extension to the intervertebral foramen. No relapses were seen in the 19 children with minimal residual tumor confined to the tumor bed. Only one of the 18 Group 2 children who were younger than 1 year of age at diagnosis relapsed. Of the 29 Group 2 children who were older than 1 year of age at diagnosis, five relapses occurred in the 14 who received radiotherapy and four relapses in the 15 who did not receive radiotherapy. All six children with disseminated relapse died. Actuarial 5-year survival in Group 2 is 87%, and actuarial relapse-free survival, 76%.\r"

Serum ferritin analysis was performed before and after BMT at monthly intervals and/or according to the clinical condition of the patient. Serum ferritin increased considerably during the first 3 months following BMT and then decreased in patients with an uncomplicated course. Ferritin levels in the serum of patients who had undergone BMT decreased gradually when complete remission was achieved, but increased with any clinical complication. Thus, elevation of serum ferritin concentration was predictable for clinical complications and for relapse. Patients with acute leukemia with serum ferritin levels above 400 micrograms/l at time of BMT had a risk of relapse within 1 year, triple that patients with lower ferritin levels. All patients who underwent BMT to treat severe aplastic anemia have completely recovered. Accordingly, following an initial increase after BMT, serum ferritin levels returned to normal and remained so in line with the patients' good clinical condition. The findings indicate that serum ferritin yields useful information in the clinical evaluation of patients undergoing BMT.\r"

  ".W": "Effective evaluation and treatment of cancer pain require valid and independent measurement of pain intensity, pain relief, and psychological distress. The Memorial Pain Assessment Card (MPAC) is a simple instrument designed to provide rapid evaluation of these subjective experiences. On the 8.5 by 11 inch card are printed the eight pain intensity descriptors, and three visual analog scales which measure pain intensity, pain relief, and mood. Experienced patients can complete it in less than 20 seconds. The authors administered the MPAC to 50 hospitalized cancer patients within 48 hours of referral to the Pain Service for inadequate pain control, together with standard measures: The McGill Pain Questionnaire, Profile of Mood States, Hamilton Depression Scale, and Zung Anxiety Scale. Correlational and multiple regression analyses revealed that the MPAC can distinguish pain intensity from pain relief and from general psychological distress, and it can provide multidimensional assessment that is practically equivalent to the full assessment battery. We conclude that the MPAC is valid and effective for clinical use, and recommend it for the assessment of individual patients, and as an outcome measure in clinical trials.\r"

Radiotherapy was given to regional lymph nodes and chest wall. Chemotherapy consisted of six cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Radiotherapy provided local and chemotherapy systemic control over the tumor, but the best patient-saving results were achieved with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This clinical trial was commenced in 1976, and the first 60 of 120 patients also received oral levamisole, 150 mg/day, on 2 consecutive days weekly as immunotherapy. All patients were followed for at least 5 years. At this stage levamisole seems to increase disease-free and overall survival in all three treatment arms (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, combined treatment). Significance is reached in disease-free survival (P = 0.035) and overall survival, adjusted for all other treatment modalities (P = 0.019).\r"

Immunotyping showed a helper phenotype with an abnormally faint expression of the T3 membrane antigen, while quantitative electron microscopic study was suggestive of neoplasia. However, T-cell receptor gene study did not show any DNA rearrangement in Ficoll-separated blood lymphocytes, whereas clonal T-cell proliferation was simultaneously evidenced in cutaneous (non-Sezary-like) tumor cells. It is concluded that reactive nonneoplastic Sezary-like cells may be present not only in various benign conditions, as previously known, but also in T-cell lymphomas. This study provides further evidence for the nonspecificity of Sezary-like changes, and stresses the utility of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement study for diagnostic and prognostic procedures during the course of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Our current understanding of the physiology of the leukotrienes is far from complete. The abundant supply of synthetic products has directed researchers into examining what the mediators affect rather than the basic mechanism studies of their involvement in disease. It is clear that the peptide leukotrienes possess potent constrictor actions of the microvasculature and can enhance permeability. These actions alone represent a new avenue of interpreting pathologic processes and could lead to alternate means of treating certain diseases in the future. It is of special interest that a consistent action of the leukotrienes is to reduce coronary blood flow, decrease myocardial contractility, and reduce cardiac output without affecting the heart rate. This profile of action is the first indication that a mediator can play a significant role in unstable angina. The main physiologic actions of the leukotrienes in the cardiovascular system are currently believed to be associated with episodes of ischemia and shock. Their relative contribution to the shock states, especially when compared with the actions of other known mediators of shock such as the prostaglandins, thromboxane, angiotensin, serotonin, and histamine, awaits clarification. LTB4 is a proinflammatory mediator that has opened a completely new perspective on the physiologic role of phagocytic cells. Novel therapeutic approaches to inflammatory-related diseases may result from an inhibition of cell chemokinesis, aggregation, and degranulation. The role of LTB4 in the immune system awaits further clarification.\r"
