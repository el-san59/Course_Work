  ".W": "The protective role of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) has been attributed to the subfractions HDL2 (according to the density) and lipoprotein A-I (LpA-I) (according to the composition in apolipoproteins). We investigated the effect of a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (P:S) on these subfractions in a homogeneous group of young adult males. Two prescribed diets were consumed successively at the subjects' homes for 3 wk each in a random order; one diet contained 70 g butter (P:S 0.2, diet B), the other contained 70 g sunflower margarine (P:S 1.1, diet M). Total calorie, fat, and cholesterol intakes were similar for the two diets. Cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in serum and in low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) were lower with diet M than with diet B. However, significant decreases in protective subfractions of HDL, HDL2, and LpA-I were observed. This undesirable effect of the diet with a high P:S could cancel the benefits of lowering the LDL-cholesterol concentrations.\r"

The histopathological differentiation, the fraction of aneuploidic cells, ODC activity, and Ki-67 reactivity were not significantly related to each other, although the number of aneuploidic cells in replicative phases correlated with the number of cells expressing the Ki-67 antigen (r = 0.86, P less than 0.01).

Seventeen patients with acute myocardial infarction, but without clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, had their circulating concentrations of the whole N-terminus (ie, pro ANF 1-98), the midportion of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone (consisting of aa 31-67; pro ANF 31-67) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) monitored daily for 14 days. All seventeen patients had elevated plasma pro ANF 1-98 and pro ANF 31-67 concentrations at the time of presentation. Maximal increase on day three post-infarction correlated with the size of infarction estimated by the maximal CPK (r = 0.675; p less than 0.05) but did not correlate with the amount of left ventricular dysfunction. Another three patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The measured pro ANF 1-98 and pro ANF 31-67 levels in these patients were within our normal range and significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than seen in patients with acute myocardial infarction not given thrombolytic therapy. Six patients with unstable angina, likewise, had normal circulating pro ANFs 1-98 and 31-67 concentrations during prolonged episodes of chest pain. These data suggest that myocardial necrosis but not ischemia triggers the release of the entire 126 aa prohormone.\r"

Immunohistochemical tests identified these deposits as IgG-kappa-light chain immunoglobulin fragments. Electron microscopy showed intracellular, rhomboid-shaped deposits enveloped by a membrane. The same deposits appeared in the conjunctival epithelium, within subconjunctival fibrocytes, and in the plasma cells of the bone marrow. Immunoelectrophoresis showed IgG-kappa-light chain fragments in the blood serum, the lacrimal film, and the aqueous humor. This suggests that the intracellular immunoglobulin fragments may have entered the corneal and conjunctival epithelium by way of the lacrimal film, the keratocytes by way of the corneo-scleral limbus vasculature, and the endothelial cells from the aqueous humor.\r"

The authors detected bcl-1 rearrangements in only 2 of 42 CLLs and 4 of 114 NHLs, specifically 3 of 29 diffuse small lymphocytic and 1 of 10 diffuse small cleaved cell and none of 5 diffuse intermediate lymphocytic, 13 follicular predominantly small cleaved, 17 follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell, 4 diffuse mixed small and large cell, 26 diffuse large cell, and 10 diffuse small noncleaved cell lymphomas. None of seven cases of Rai stage III or IV CLL or seven diffuse large cell lymphomas occurring as Richter's syndrome exhibited bcl-1 rearrangements. In conclusion, the bcl-1 locus rearranges in only about 4% of B-cell CLLs and NHLs, is predominantly rearranged in low-grade B-cell neoplasms, and does not appear to be preferentially associated with those occasional CLLs and low-grade NHLs displaying clinical aggressiveness, advanced clinical stage, or large cell transformation (Richter's syndrome). Therefore the demonstration of bcl-1 rearrangement does not appear to have clinically useful prognostic significance.\r"

Two patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were transfused for postoperative bleeding, and only one patient required reoperation for any reason. A prospective study showed reduced operating time (20 minutes) and patient charges ($546) using electrosurgical dissection compared with laser. Reusable trocars were used without any associated injury or morbidity. An effective strategy for selective cholangiography was developed based on patient history, liver enzymes, and common duct diameter. In conclusion, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to be a safe operation. The cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be enhanced ($1,271) with no loss of patient benefit using the combination of electrosurgery, reusable trocars, and selective cholangiograms in low-risk patients.\r"

After insertion of venous and arterial (radial and pulmonary) catheters, baseline measurements of tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (RR), ventilatory response to CO2, and arterial and mixed venous blood gases were made. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either desflurane with O2 (n = 6) or with O2 and 60% N2O (n = 6). Anesthesia was induced by inhalation of desflurane followed by tracheal intubation without muscle relaxants. In each volunteer, at end-tidal concentrations totaling 0.83, 1.24, and 1.66 MAC, we repeated measurements of VT, RR, response to CO2, and arterial and mixed venous blood gases. As depth of anesthesia increased, VT significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased from 363 +/- 22 ml awake to 76 +/- 22 ml at 1.66 MAC without N2O and from 473 +/- 70 ml awake to 128 +/- 6 ml at 1.66 MAC with N2O (mean +/- SE). Similarly, RR increased from 15 +/- 0.5 breaths per min awake to 32 +/- 2 breaths per min at 1.66 MAC without N2O and from 14 +/- 0.5 breaths per min awake to 40 +/- 3 breaths per min at 1.66 MAC with N2O. Desflurane without N2O depressed the ventilatory response to CO2 to 45 +/- 9, 31 +/- 5, and 11 +/- 4% of the awake values at 0.83, 1.24, and 1.66 MAC, respectively.

The normal responsiveness of the cerebral vasculature to PaCO2 is approximately 2 ml.min-1.100 g-1.mmHg-1. This study examined the effect of desflurane, a new volatile anesthetic, on the responsiveness of the cerebral vasculature to changes in PaCO2. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), CBF, CVR, intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral metabolic rate for O2 (CMRO2) were measured in five dogs anesthetized with desflurane (0.5-1.5 MAC) at normocapnia (PaCO2 = 40 mmHg) and at two levels of hypocapnia (PaCO2 = approximately 30 and approximately 20 mmHg). Under desflurane anesthesia, similar changes in CBF and CVR occurred with hyperventilation at all MAC levels of desflurane. At 0.5 MAC, CBF decreased significantly, from 81 +/- 6 to 40 +/- 3 ml.min-1.100 g-1 (P less than 0.05, mean +/- SE) when PaCO2 was decreased from 40 to 24 mmHg; i.e., the CBF decreased approximately 2.6 ml.min-1.100 g-1.mmHg-1. At 1.0 MAC desflurane, CBF decreased significantly, from 79 +/- 10 to 43 +/- 5 ml.min-1.100 g-1 with hyperventilation (2.0 ml.min-1.100 g-1.mmHg-1); at 1.5 MAC desflurane, CBF decreased from 65 +/- 6 to 38 +/- 2 ml.min-1.100 g-1 with hyperventilation (1.6 ml.min-1.100 g-1.mmHg-1). Despite the significant decreases in CBF with hyperventilation, there was no significant change in ICP.

The authors examined the effects of this agent on normal swine and those from a special breeding program that were considered purebred for susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH). Animals were exposed to 1 or 2 MAC or both doses of desflurane and observed for changes in end-tidal CO2, arterial blood gases, lactate, catecholamines, core temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. All normal swine tolerated exposure to desflurane without clinical signs of MH, but significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure were noted. In contrast, of six MH susceptible swine tested, two had unequivocal MH reactions to deflurane, defined by significant increases of end-tidal CO2 (greater than 50 mmHg), an increase in PaCO2 (greater than 70 mmHg), a decrease in blood pH (less than 7.30), an increase in blood lactate concentration, and an increase in core temperature. Two other susceptible swine showed equivocal signs of MH but not until desflurane had been administered for 40-60 min. Finally, two other susceptible swine showed no signs of MH after 60 min of exposure to 2 MAC desflurane. These latter four animals all developed episodes of MH immediately after intravenous succinylcholine (2 mg/kg). The increased PaCO2, blood lactate concentrations, and temperature, and the decrease in pH induced by desflurane, were successfully treated with dantrolene and supportive measures. All surviving animals were biopsied 1 to 2 weeks after the exposure to desflurane for in vitro contracture testing to confirm MH susceptibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Surprisingly little is known about the metabolic and ventilatory responses to unsupported upper extremity activity even though some of the muscles of the upper torso and shoulder girdle are used to perform simple and complex everyday tasks as well as partake in ventilation. To determine the effect of simple arm elevation in 20 patients with CAO we studied their lung function, VO2, VCO2, and VE, with arms down at the side (AD), during 2 min with arms extended forward up to shoulder level (AE), and during recovery. To determine the pattern of ventilatory muscle recruitment we also measured endoesophageal (Ppl), gastric (Pg), and transdiaphragmatic (Pdl) pressures. In five of the patients the electromyographic signal (EMG) of the sternocleidomastoid (Sm) muscle was recorded and analyzed in its time domain (amplitude) and power spectrum density (median frequency). Within 30 s of arm elevation VO2, VCO2, and VE rose and remained elevated for 1 min after the arms were lowered. The increase in VE resulted from increases in respiratory rate and minimal rise in tidal volume (VT). With AE, FEV1 decreased by 5% (p less than 0.02) but FRC increased by 2% (p less than 0.05). Peak inspiratory pressure (Pimax) dropped from 54 +/- 4 to 48 +/- 4 cm H2O (p less than 0.005); Pdimax remained unchanged. Immediately after raising the arms Pgi, inspiratory swing in Pdi (delta Pdi), end-expiratory Ppl, and end-expiratory Pg increased significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In patients with SAS, mean nocturnal apnea index was 46 +/- 20/h, and mean nocturnal SO2 was 86 +/- 6% versus 94.6 +/- 1.8% during the daytime. Daytime mean P50 of the patients was 28.5 +/- 1.2 mm Hg versus 27.1 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the normal subjects (p less than 0.05). Daytime mean 2.3-DPG was 1.23 +/- 0.25 moles DPG/mole hemoglobin versus 0.80 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.05). Significant correlations were found in patients between P50 and mean nocturnal SO2 (r = -0.62, p less than 0.01) and between P50 and 2,3-DPG (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01). The measurements were repeated in five patients after surgical or positive-pressure treatment. P50 and 2,3-DPG both decreased and returned to normal values. In conclusion, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the right in patients with SAS and there is an increase in 2,3-DPG.

Ischemia-reperfusion resulted in the production of prostacyclin and thromboxane assessed by lung effluent and tissue measurements of their respective stable metabolites, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha thromboxane B2 (TxB2). In contrast, prostaglandin F2 alpha did not increase. Ischemia-reperfusion also caused lung injury as assessed by increased lung 125I-BSA accumulation compared with nonischemic control lungs. Addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin, or flubiprofen to the lung perfusate before and after ischemia inhibited lung injury as well as the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2. Addition of a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (U 63557A) reduced lung injury as well as TxB2 formation without affecting the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The attenuation of lung injury was not explained by direct H2O2 removal by indomethacin, flubiprofen, or U 63557A because the concentrations of the inhibitors used in the isolated lung experiments did not remove exogenously added H2O2 from buffer in vitro. We conclude that cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid are involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury to isolated rat lungs.\r"

To evaluate the concept that this bias extends to the accumulation of T-cells with the preferential use of specific T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) beta-chain constant region elements, beta-chain mRNA transcripts of lung and blood T-cells of normal subjects and patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis were compared for the relative usage of constant region beta 1 or beta 2 elements. Quantitative evaluation of C beta 1 and C beta 2 mRNA transcripts demonstrated a C beta 1/C beta 2 usage in normal blood of 0.63 +/- 0.02, similar to that of normal lung (0.64 +/- 0.06, p greater than 0.7), and in sarcoid blood (0.59 +/- 0.03, p greater than 0.2). In contrast, the lung T-lymphocytes of patients with sarcoidosis reflected a marked bias in the usage of C beta 1 elements (C beta 1/C beta 2: 0.88 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.001 compared with sarcoid blood and normal blood; p less than 0.02 compared with normal lung). Interestingly, a subgroup of these patients (six of 18) showed a markedly exaggerated skewing in the use of C beta 1 elements (C beta 1/C beta 2 ratio greater than 1, i.e., greater than 3 standard deviations above mean), demonstrating heterogeneity among sarcoid patients with regard to specific C beta 1 usage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. PATIENTS: Six hundred sixty-five consecutive patients undergoing hip replacement at five participating hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either fixed-dose LMW heparin, 30 mg subcutaneously twice daily, or fixed-dose standard calcium heparin, 7500 units subcutaneously twice daily; both regimens were started 12 to 24 hours after surgery and continued for 14 days or until discharge if sooner. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had postoperative I-125-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. If results of one or both tests were positive, then venography was done. Otherwise, venography was done between day 10 and day 14, or sooner if the patient was ready for discharge. RESULTS: Evaluable venograms were obtained in 258 of the 333 patients randomly assigned to receive LMW heparin and in 263 of the 332 patients assigned to receive calcium heparin. For patients with evaluable venograms, thrombosis was detected in 50 patients (19.4%) who received LMW heparin compared with 61 patients (23.2%) who received standard heparin (difference, -3.8%; 95% CI, -11.1% to 3.6%) (P greater than 0.2). Proximal deep vein thrombosis was detected in 5.4% of the patients receiving LMW heparin and in 6.5% of the patients receiving standard heparin (difference, -1.1%; CI, - 5.2% to 3.3%) (P greater than 0.2). For the entire group of 665 patients, venous thrombosis occurred in 17.1% given LMW heparin and in 19.0% given standard heparin. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 31 patients (9.3%) given standard heparin and in 17 patients (5.1%) given LMW heparin (difference, 4.2%; CI, 0.3% to 8.2%) (P = 0.035). The relative risk reduction was 45%. The rate of major bleeding in the standard heparin group was 5.7% compared with 3.3% in the LMW heparin group (difference, 2.4%; CI, -1.0% to 5.4%) (P = 0.13). The relative risk reduction was 42%. CONCLUSION: Low molecular weight heparin is significantly less hemorrhagic than standard unfractionated heparin; the difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, although not statistically significant (P greater than 0.2), favors the use of LMW heparin.\r"

DESIGN: Before-and-after trial in patients known to respond to intravenous desmopressin. SETTING: Regional, comprehensive, hemophilia diagnosis and treatment center. PATIENTS: A total of 22 patients, including 11 patients with von Willebrand disease, 8 patients with mild hemophilia A, and 3 symptomatic hemophilia carriers. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were infused with desmopressin, 0.3 micrograms/kg body weight. At least 1 week later, they were taught to self-administer desmopressin nasal spray, 150 micrograms to each nostril. MEASUREMENTS: In patients with hemophilia, the level of factor VIII activity was measured; in patients with von Willebrand disease, levels of factor VIII activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen as well as bleeding time were measured before and after each administration of desmopressin. MAIN RESULTS: Desmopressin, when administered intravenously or intranasally, elevated levels of factor VIII, ristocetin cofactor, and von Willebrand antigen in both mildly hemophiliac patients and patients with von Willebrand disease when compared with baseline measures (P less than 0.05). Factor VIII levels adequate for hemostasis were achieved by 82% of the hemophiliac patients. An abnormal bleeding time was corrected in the majority (62%) of patients with von Willebrand disease. CONCLUSION: A nasal spray preparation of desmopressin apparently was effective both in treating bleeding episodes and when used prophylactically for minor surgical procedures in several patients.\r"

  ".U": "91158276\r", 
  ".W": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase is a zinc metalloproteinase which is released during P. aeruginosa infections. Pseudomonas keratitis, which occurs following contact lens-induced corneal trauma, can lead to rapid, liquefactive necrosis of the cornea. This destruction has been attributed to the release of both host-derived enzymes and the bacterial products P. aeruginosa elastase, alkaline protease, exotoxin A, and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin. A synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor, HSCH2 (DL)CH[CH2CH(CH3)2]CO-Phe-Ala-NH2, which we previously showed to be a potent inhibitor of corneal collagenase and alkali-induced corneal ulceration, was tested as a potential inhibitor of P. aeruginosa elastase. Inhibition constants (Kis) for the resolved diastereomers were determined with the chromogenic substrate furylacryloyl-glycyl-L-leucyl-L-alanine. One isomer had a Ki of 0.3 microM, while the other had a Ki of 0.4 microM. The more potent diastereomer was evaluated in vivo in experimentally induced Pseudomonas keratitis in rabbits. Following inoculation of one cornea of each rabbit, topical treatment with a 1 mM solution of the inhibitor significantly delayed the onset of corneal melting and perforation, as compared with the results for the control and gentamicin-treated groups. This protective effect suggests that the inhibitor may have a therapeutic application by delaying the progression of corneal destruction in Pseudomonas keratitis.\r"

  ".W": "A national surveillance study was conducted to determine trends in antimicrobial resistance patterns among three common causes of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Fifteen participating U.S. medical centers submitted clinically significant isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae to two central laboratories for testing with a group of 12 antimicrobial agents. The majority of isolates were recovered from adult males greater than 50 years old. Overall, 84.1% of 378 M. catarrhalis and 16.5% of 564 H. influenzae (29.5% of type b strains; 15.0% of non-type b strains) produced beta-lactamase and were thus resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin. Resistance in H. influenzae to other agents was 2.1% to tetracycline, 0.7% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 1.1% to cefaclor, and 0.2% to cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanate, while the M. catarrhalis isolates yielded very low MICs of these latter drugs. As demonstrated in prior studies, erythromycin showed little activity against H. influenzae. Of 487 S. pneumoniae isolates, 1 (0.2%) was penicillin resistant, while 3.8% were relatively resistant to penicillin, 4.5% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2.3% were resistant to tetracycline, 1.2% were resistant to chloramphenicol, and 0.2% were resistant to erythromycin. Overall, the lowest resistance rates for these common bacterial respiratory pathogens were noted with amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, and cefaclor.\r"

A technique was developed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of these microspheres and of controls (unloaded microspheres or gel). CH HCl microspheres exhibited antibacterial activity over a period of 16 days. Similar results were obtained with microspheres suspended in a methocel gel, and their antibacterial activity also continued for about 16 days. Empty microspheres or gel media alone were ineffective. The release rates of CH HCl from human albumin microspheres coated onto catheters by use of different gel formulations were also determined. The microsphere formulations were found to provide sustained antibacterial activity even at a low drug concentration.\r"

These variants showed cross resistance to other quinolones. In 8 of 13 strains tested, ciprofloxacin selected imipenem-resistant variants in a similar way to imipenem. The opposite phenomenon of ciprofloxacin-imipenem cross resistance after exposure to imipenem was not detected. None of the ciprofloxacin-resistant variants showed cross resistance to aztreonam, piperacillin, or tobramycin. These findings indicate that widespread and uncritical use of ciprofloxacin gives a potential risk of development of resistance in P. aeruginosa not only to quinolones but also to another unrelated useful agent, imipenem. In vitro evaluation of this phenomenon in isolates from patients with P. aeruginosa infections may be justified, since strains differ in development of quinolone-imipenem cross resistance after ciprofloxacin exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular tubercle bacilli (TB) reside in vacuoles in infected human macrophages (MPs). The relative impotency of streptomycin against TB in MPs and the contrary greatly increased potency of pyrazinamide (PZA) have been attributed to the fact that these vacuoles are phagolysosomes and, therefore, acidic. Chloroquine (CQ) is a lysomotropic base which can be used to raise phagolysosomal pH. Consequently, it was tested for its ability to increase the anti-TB effectiveness of streptomycin and decrease that of PZA in cultured human MPs. MPs infected with virulent Erdman strain TB were incubated in medium with various combinations of the drugs. Samples were taken at 0, 4, and 7 days and lysed for CFU counts of viable TB on nutrient agar. As expected, CQ increased the effectiveness of SM, but unexpectedly, it did not decrease that of PZA. CQ alone was found to be able to inhibit intracellular TB. Because of this, it was also tested with isoniazid, 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3, and 25-OH-vitamin D3. It significantly enhanced the anti-TB protectiveness of both isoniazid and 25-OH-vitamin D3. Some combinations of CQ and the various drugs tested were able to kill intracellular TB. These results suggest that CQ may be useful in the treatment of tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect of serum on the in vitro activities of 11 antimicrobial agents against gram-negative isolates obtained from 100 patients with nosocomial bacteremia. The test organisms included 25 stains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 75 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae. MICs were determined by broth microdilution with Mueller-Hinton broth alone or supplemented with 25 or 50% pooled, heat-inactivated human serum (25S or 50S, respectively). Among the antibiotics evaluated, the protein binding ranged from 9 to 95%. The antibiotics tested and their MICs for 90% of the strains tested in 50S included ciprofloxacin (0.12 micrograms/ml), ceftazidime (1 micrograms/ml), imipenem (1 micrograms/ml), aztreonam (4 micrograms/ml), cefpirome (4 micrograms/ml), cefotaxime (16 micrograms/ml), cefoperazone (16 micrograms/ml), desacetylcefotaxime plus cefotaxime (32 micrograms/ml), ceftriaxone (greater than 32 micrograms/ml), ticarcillin (128 micrograms/ml), and desacetylcefotaxime (greater than 128 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the strains tested were calculated with 95% confidence intervals to show the precision of the MICs for these strains. With the exceptions of ceftriaxone (greater than 95% protein bound) and cefoperazone (90% protein bound), serum had no significant effect on the in vitro activities of various agents. A fourfold-or-greater increase in the MIC of ceftriaxone was observed in 45 of 100 isolates with 50S and in 30 of 100 isolates with 25S. With cefoperazone, 17 of 100 isolates demonstrated more than 2 twofold dilution increases in 50S. Testing of antibiotics which were less protein bound illustrated minor effects primarily with members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The presence of serum did not adversely affect the in vitro activities of broad-spectrum agents against these nosocomial isolates.\r"

Laboratory investigations showed leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate to be common features and the first two variables were significantly associated with cardiac involvement. Treatment regimens changed over the study period. Aspirin was used in most patients often in conjunction with dipyridamole and from 1986 intravenous immunoglobulin was given routinely to those patients seen early in the illness. Additional therapeutic measures in individual patients included prostacyclin, heparin, streptokinase, and plasma exchange/exchange transfusion. Attention is drawn to the uncertainity of the long term cardiovascular consequences in the light of adults reported with premature atherosclerotic lesions of similar appearance to those seen in Kawasaki disease.\r"

A cellular based enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to demonstrate the presence of antiendothelial cell antibodies in sera from children with Kawasaki disease. Twenty one of 32 patients with Kawasaki disease had raised IgM antibody titres and four had raised IgG antiendothelial antibody titres. There was a significant difference in the IgM antiendothelial cell antibody titres when comparing the patients with normals and febrile controls. The antibody titre paralleled the disease activity in patients studied serially. There was no relative increase in binding of antiendothelial cell antibodies after cytokine stimulation. These findings may be of importance in further research into the understanding of mechanisms involved in this and other forms of vasculitis in man.\r"

HIV antigens p17, p24, gp41, and gp120 were determined in sera by immunoblot and antigen capture assays. Lymphocyte blast transformation, serum immunoglobulins, and circulating immune complexes were also evaluated. Altogether 50 patients had HIV antigens measured: 31 (62%) patients had p17 antigen in the serum and 29 (58%) had p24 antigen present. In 19 (38%) and nine (18%) patients, respectively, gp120 and gp41 were detected. All four HIV antigens were detected in seven (14%) patients. There was a positive correlation between the concentration of each HIV sequential specimens were outcome. When sequential specimens were analysed, 120 (73%) patients had p24 antigen present. Patients with stage P2B and P2D (Centers for Disease Control classification) had the highest concentrations of p24 antigen with a mean of approximately 200 pg/ml. Altogether 70% of patients with a p24 antigen concentration of greater than 30 pg/ml eventually died or had severe clinical disease within six to 24 months. Infants under 15 months of age with a p24 antigen concentration as low as 5 pg/ml also did poorly. Increased immunoglobulins and decreases in mitogenic responses and absolute CD4+ lymphocyte counts were more prevalent in patients with raised p24 antigen. Raised concentrations of circulating immune complexes were seen in the symptomatic phase of the disease whereas in the terminal stage of the disease raised serum antigen and a decrease in circulating immune complexes and absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count were evident. Loss of p24 and/or p17 antibody as well as a decreasing ELISA optical density for HIV antibody also signalled progression of the disease.\r"

In the 'intervention' group (n = 16; mean (SD) weight 1559 (228) g and length of gestation 33.2 (1.8) weeks), infants were allowed to suckle at the breast when their general condition permitted after as much milk as possible had been expressed, and were then given the full required feeds by tube. Full breast feeding was started as soon as the infant could suck adequately. Sixteen control infants (mean (SD) weight 1605 (198) g and length of gestation 34.1 (2.4) weeks), were breast fed in the conventional manner only after it had been established that they could suck well; until then they received all their feeds by tube. After discharge the mean (SD) periods of exclusive and total breast feeding were longer in the group that had received the intervention (3.7 (1.3) and 5.1 (2.2) months, respectively) than among the controls (1.9 (0.6) and 3.3 (1.9) months, respectively). This 'intervention' method helps to promote milk formation, provides sucking experience for low birthweight infants without interfering with their nutritional intake and consequent weight gain, and encourages subsequent breast feeding with its well recognised advantages.\r"

Patients also received up to 3.25 L of saline daily during the treatment period. Of 157 patients for whom data could be evaluated for efficacy, 63% (72/114) of etidronate-treated and 33% (14/43) of saline-treated patients had a normalization of total serum calcium levels. When serum calcium levels were adjusted for albumin (147 assessable patients), 24% of the etidronate- and 7% of the saline-treated patients responded to treatment. No serious side effects or treatment-related deaths occurred. When accompanied by adequate hydration and diuresis, intravenous etidronate was safe and more effective than hydration and diuresis alone in controlling hypercalcemia of malignancy.\r"

Samples with thyrotropin concentrations below 0.20 mU/L or above 6.0 mU/L and/or free thryoxine concentrations above 22.0 pmol/L were selected for further assays. These selected individuals were followed-up during 3 years. Of 18 individuals without thyroid hormone treatment who had thyrotropin concentrations less than 0.20 pmol/L (13 below 0.10 pmol/L), only two were proved to be hyperthyroid; in another three, hyperthyroidism could not be excluded. The results indicate that most elderly individuals with low serum thyrotropin concentrations are not hyperthyroid and that abnormal thyroxine-binding globulin (in conjunction with drug treatment or nonthyroidal illness) is not a common cause of low thyrotropin concentration.\r"

These cases were collected at one community hospital over a 6-month period. A review of the current literature reveals reports of 10 similar cases. We conclude that, although the exact incidence of pleural complications of small-bore feeding tubes is unknown, it is not insignificant. The traditional methods of assessing proper nasogastric tube placement are inadequate when applied to these small tubes. Only a chest roentgenogram can assure placement in the stomach. Education of hospital staff on methods to avoid malposition of feeding tubes has resulted in an absence of pulmonary complications over a subsequent 1-year period.\r"

Common findings in US, CT, and MRI include parasylvian and midline clefts, size asymmetries of the basal ganglia and thalamus, cerebral parenchymal volume loss, ventriculomegaly, ventricular diverticula, and absence of the septum pellucidum. MRI and CT were superior to US in detecting calcification, gyral and sulcal abnormalities, and parasylvian clefts. MRI alone demonstrated homolateral absence of the sylvian vasculature, small medullary pyramids, low position of the fornix, and the thinning of the corpus callosum. Although US appears adequate as a screening test, MRI best defines the precise pathoanatomic findings of neonatal schizencephaly and allows for the prediction of neurologic outcomes in affected newborns.\r"

In contrast to the normal cortical pattern, the cortex, with a smooth surface, demonstrated quite different staining patterns in the molecular, superficial cellular, sparsely cellular, and deep cellular layers. The molecular layer was abnormally positive with synaptophysin staining. The superficial cellular layer was also diffusely stained for synaptophysin; there was a positive reaction in the linearly arranged myelin sheaths. The sparsely cellular layer revealed less staining for synaptophysin, but was perivascularly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. In the deep cellular layer, synaptophysin staining had multiple neuronal columns and myelin basic protein-staining had a reticular pattern around neuronal columns. These results suggest that the sparsely cellular layer may correspond to the molecular layer and white matter in normal brain; neurons with forming myelin sheaths in the superficial cellular layer regularly penetrate the surface of the molecular layer, forming arrested cortical columns in the deep cellular layer.\r"

Here we show evidence of the possible involvement of p53 gene mutations in lymphoid leukemias studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. Fourteen patients with various leukemias were examined and two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia were identified to have mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene. These mutations included point mutation, triplet deletion, and single nucleotide insertion. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in the samples from these three patients. In one of them, chromosome 17p was deleted, suggesting the absence of the nonmutated p53 gene, whereas in the other two patients, chromosome 17p seemed to be intact by cytogenetic analysis. Our results suggest that alterations of the p53 gene may have a role in the genesis of some leukemias.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated 17 patients (12 males and 5 females, ages 2 to 57 years old) with posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis to determine relationships between clinical courses and hepatitis C virus (HCV) markers. The patients were grouped according to time course of abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels into three categories (chronic biochemical disease, biochemically resolved chronic disease, and acute disease). Latest serum samples (1.3 to 10.8 years after blood transfusion) were used to detect antibodies against C100-3 antigen (anti-HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and HCV sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Of the 17 patients, 13 patients (76.5%) were anti-HCV positive and 8 patients (47.1%), including one anti-HCV negative case, were positive for HCV RNA. In total, 14 patients (82.4%) were positive for either HCV markers. With respect to clinical course, HCV RNA was detected in six of eight patients (75%) with chronic biochemical disease, and in two of five patients (40%) with biochemically resolved chronic disease. HCV RNA was not detectable in convalescent sera from four patients with acute disease. These results show that there is a relationship between clinical status and HCV viremia, but that normal liver function tests do not always represent the clearance of the virus. Viremia in two patients with normal ALT level suggests that hepatitis is not only caused by viral cytopathic effects, but also by immunologic reactions against virus-infected cells. Thus, PCR is useful in determining the persistence of HCV infection as well as to diagnose anti-HCV negative HCV infection.\r"

  ".W": "The biosynthesis, processing, and ligand-binding function of the membrane-associated and soluble forms of the folate-binding protein (FBP) in KB cells, a cultured human cell line, were studied using pulse-chase labeling with [35S] methionine. The intermediary and mature forms of the protein were isolated by immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis and autoradiography. The earliest species identified had an Mr of 32 Kd and disappeared over 5 hours concomitant with the appearance of a 38-Kd cellular FBP. As the 38-Kd species disappeared, a 40-Kd form appeared in the medium. When tunicamycin was added to the culture medium to inhibit core glycosylation, a 26-Kd aglycosylated species and minor 28-Kd and 30-Kd forms appeared. Endoglycosidase H, which cleaves high mannose but not complex oligosaccharides, reduced the 32-Kd species to 26-Kd but the enzyme had no effect on the 38-Kd form, indicating that this species is complex glycosylated. Monensin, which blocks complex glycosylation, also inhibited synthesis of the 38-Kd species. Although both the 32-Kd and 38-Kd forms had ligand-binding sites (as demonstrated by binding to a folate-Sepharose matrix), the 26-Kd aglycosylated species, labeled in the presence of tunicamycin, lacked similar binding sites because it did not bind to the affinity matrix. In contrast, the aglycosylated 26-Kd form, which was obtained by treatment of the 32-Kd species with endoglycosidase H, did bind to the folate affinity matrix, indicating that it retained ligand-binding function. Thus, the high mannose oligosaccharide moiety is not required for the folate-binding property of the FBP, but its addition to the polypeptide chain precedes a later step that is necessary for the mature protein to have ligand-binding function.\r"

Particular attention was devoted to cells with markers of natural killer (NK) activity. Double- and triple-color cytofluorimetric analysis was used to better characterize the phenotypic features of the different subsets. Apart from a reduced number of T lymphocytes (CD3+) in DS children and of B lymphocytes (CD19+) in both DS groups, the major alteration we found was a marked age-related increase of the percentage of cells bearing markers associated with NK activity, such as CD16, CD56, and CD57. These DS cells were apparently severely defective as far as their function was concerned, because NK activity was significantly reduced in comparison with age-matched controls, but still capable of responding to cytokines such as interleukin-2, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma, and to the modulation of lytic activity exerted by the anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody. On the whole, our data stress the importance of studying DS subjects of different ages to fully appreciate the immunologic derangement characteristic of this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells have abundant cytoplasmic CD3/Ti but express low amounts on the cell surface and are deficient in CD3/Ti-mediated signal transduction. Nevertheless, plating T-ALL cells on dishes containing immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies with a source of growth factors induced the expression of CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain) and stimulated the formation of blast colonies in 12 of 14 cases studied. The proliferative response to CD3 ligation was modulated by the presence of antibodies to the CD2, CD4, or CD8 accessory T-cell receptors. The effect of these accessory receptors on signal transduction mediated by CD3/Ti was next investigated by monitoring cytoplasmic calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) and by measuring tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation. Crosslinking CD3, CD2, CD4, or CD8 alone did not induce cytoplasmic calcium mobilization in T-ALLs, but crosslinking the accessory receptors with CD3/Ti induced calcium responses in three of the T-ALLs and enhanced calcium responses in three of the T-ALL cell lines, including HPB-ALL, MOLT-4, and CEM. Crosslinking CD4 but not CD2 with CD3/Ti greatly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates in comparison with crosslinking either CD4 or CD3/Ti separately on both normal mature T cells and the CEM T-ALL cell line. Thus, CD4 regulates CD3/Ti signal transduction in T-ALL cells through the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates whereas CD2 may regulate [Ca2+]i signal transduction through a separate mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Cytokine-secreting, major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted activated killer (AK) cells are toxic to a wide range of virus-infected or malignant target cells and may be generated endogenously, eg, after bone marrow transplantation, or by infusion of cytokines such as recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). Although AK cells secrete cytokines such as gamma-interferon and tumor necrosis factor, which are themselves able to recruit fresh cytokine-secreting AK cells, activation in both settings is short-lived, implying the existence of homeostatic regulatory mechanisms. We now demonstrate one mechanism by which rapid homeostasis is achieved. We show that IL-4 is produced in patients with both endogenously and exogenously generated AK cells. The cytokine was detected in serum after marrow transplantation, and IL-4 transcripts appeared in circulating lymphocytes during rIL-2 infusion. Although IL-4 inhibited the induction phase of AK cell function, it had no significant inhibitory effect on the ability of AK cells from these individuals to respond to restimulation. Nonetheless, neutralization of the IL-4 induced during cell activation doubled the half-life of AK function, once activating stimuli were removed, from 18 to 44 hours and produced a 2-log increase in AK cell secretion of tumor necrosis factor and gamma-interferon. These data suggest that IL-4 induced in vivo during lymphocyte activation abbreviates AK cell responses once the triggering stimuli have been removed. Neutralization of endogenous IL-4 in vivo by appropriate monoclonal antibodies might prolong the duration of AK function.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To measure the effects of changes in treatment of acute myeloblastic leukaemia that may give better value for money. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of patients' notes to identify items of management costing money; prospective costing of these items. The Medical Research Council acute myeloblastic leukaemia 9 trial was used to identify the amount and distribution of these costs when either one or two courses of induction treatment were required to obtain complete remission. These findings were then extrapolated to four published international controlled trials using similarly intense treatment and in which the number of courses of treatment required for complete remission was stated, to compare British costs for treatment with idarubicin and daunorubicin, both in combination with cytarabine. SETTING--Leukaemia unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London. SUBJECTS--Data on 10 patients receiving intensive induction treatment for acute myeloblastic leukaemia were used to identify 160 items of cost in four broad groups: general (including accommodation), diagnostic, supportive treatment, and cytotoxic chemotherapy. One newly treated patient was prospectively assessed over one month, including a time and motion study, to cost these items; then costs for 268 patients from the MRC trial receiving moderate induction chemotherapy including daunorubicin were assessed, and costs for treatment of 522 patients in the four international studies comparing daunorubicin with idarubicin were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cost effectiveness was measured as the overall cost to obtain complete remission in untreated patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia after treatment with idarubicin or daunorubicin. RESULTS--The 160 costed items were measured for their sensitivity in varying the total cost of treatment, this being assessed within Britain in other district general and private hospitals to measure the extremes of cost of these items. Overall, idarubicin, although more expensive, showed a substantial saving (1477 pounds per patient) in total hospital costs, more than offsetting the increased cost (607 pounds) of the new treatment, an overall savings of 870 pounds per patient (5%). CONCLUSION--Approaches modelling cost effectiveness may be an essential part of planning new programmes of treatment in the future. This method can be used to estimate the cost effectiveness of the treatments in different environments and countries where costs may vary widely.\r"

Twelve healthy young men took part in this investigation of the effect of oral theophylline and dipyridamole (two drugs known to affect the pharmacological effects of the purine nucleoside adenosine) on the respiratory response to isocapnic hypoxia. 2. The subjects underwent hypoxic rebreathing manoeuvres after 3-day pretreatments with each of the drugs for 12 h and were at least 2 h postprandial. For each in-Minute ventilation, the maximum rate of isometric inspiratory pressure development at the mouth and the ratio of inspiratory duration to total breath duration were analysed breath-by-breath and regressions of these variables upon the haemoglobin oxygen saturation were performed. 3. The slopes and intercepts of the lines describing the relationships of minute ventilation and the maximum rate of isometric inspiratory pressure development at the mouth with haemoglobin oxygen saturation were unaffected by the study drugs, and no differences in the pattern of breathing were observed. 4. We conclude that oral administration of these drugs does not result in alteration of the response of the respiratory system to progressive isocapnic hypoxia. 5. This suggests that either adenosine has no physiological role in hypoxic respiratory control as measured, or that it has opposing peripheral chemoreceptor and central respiratory centre effects which could not be distinguished by the techniques used.\r"

To examine whether or not atrial natriuretic peptide-induced proteinuria simply results from increases in urine flow or glomerular filtration rate, we infused dopamine (1 microgram min-1 kg-1) and alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (0.025 microgram min-1 kg-1) into nine patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and nine essential hypertensive patients without renal damage, and compared the effects of the two agents on renal function and urinary protein excretion. 2. In patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, dopamine infusion significantly increased urinary sodium excretion (+59%), renal blood flow (+20%) and creatinine clearance (+14%). However, urinary protein excretion was not changed. Addition of atrial natriuretic peptide to the dopamine infusion further increased urinary sodium excretion and maintained creatinine clearance at the same level. In contrast to the infusion of dopamine alone, atrial natriuretic peptide markedly increased urinary protein excretion (77 versus 229 mg min-1 m2, P less than 0.02). Furthermore, the addition of atrial natriuretic peptide elevated the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (1.55 versus 5.35, P less than 0.05), while dopamine alone did not (1.55 versus 1.45, not significant). 3. In essential hypertensive patients, dopamine and dopamine plus ANP showed renal effects similar to those of chronic glomerulonephritis; however, the urinary excretion of protein was not changed significantly. 4. These results suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide may increase urinary protein excretion mainly by increasing the permeability of the damaged glomeruli to protein rather than by simply increasing urine flow or glomerular filtration. Possible mechanisms underlying the proteinuria-increasing effects of atrial natriuretic peptide are discussed.\r"

The fractional clearances of pepsinogen A (PGA), pepsinogen C (PGC) and the main PGA isozymogens, i.e. PGA-3, PGA-4 and PGA-5, were measured in 13 healthy male volunteers before and during blockade of tubular protein reabsorption by intravenous infusion of either L-arginine hydrochloride (n = 8; 0.5 g h-1 kg-1 body weight) or an equimolar amount of L-lysine hydrochloride (n = 5; 0.44 g h-1 kg-1 body weight). Glomerular filtration rate was measured by a radioisotope method. 2. The fractional baseline clearance of PGC (1 +/- 1%) was lower than that of PGA (20 +/- 10%). In addition, the fractional clearance of the PGA isozymogens appeared to be different: the fractional clearance of PGA-5 (7 +/- 3%) was lower than that of PGA-4 (18 +/- 9%), and the fractional clearance of PGA-4 was lower than that of PGA-3 (30 +/- 10%). These differences in fractional clearance between PGA isozymogens decreased during infusion of both arginine and lysine. 3. Pepsinogens are freely filtered proteins. It can therefore be concluded that the differences in fractional clearance between PGA isozymogens imply differences in tubular reabsorption. This is remarkable as PGA isozymogens are proteins with an almost identical amino acid sequence and electric charge. The disappearance of the differences in tubular reabsorption during arginine and lysine infusion suggests that PGA isozymogens differ in affinity for negatively charged binding sites in the tubular cell membrane. In order to explain the low fractional clearance of PGC compared with that of PGA and the less marked effect of arginine or lysine infusion on the fractional clearance of PGC, an additional PGC-specific binding site has to be postulated.\r"

  ".U": "91160753\r", 
  ".W": "The risks of menotropin therapy (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, multiple gestation, adnexal torsion) are well known and have been previously described. Superovulation should not be considered for the indications described herein until more traditional therapies for infertility have been tried and found unsuccessful and sufficient time has elapsed for conception to occur. The cost of superovulation is high: the medications are expensive, frequent E2 monitoring and US studies are costly, and pregnancy complications relating to the higher rate of pregnancy loss and multiple gestation may add substantially to the overall cost. Yet, compared with IVF and GIFT, superovulation cycles combined with IUI cost between one third to one sixth that of an IVF cycle. Protocols involving combined CC/hMG/hCG, which reduce the total number of ampules of Pergonal needed per cycle and still provide multiple follicular development, may further reduce costs. There is a growing consensus that superovulation-IUI protocols should be attempted before GIFT and IVF in couples with normal pelvic viscera. There is little doubt that IVF and GIFT cycles are more costly, stressful, and complex. No comparative data have clearly shown IVF and GIFT to be superior to superovulation protocols in ovulatory women with normal pelvic anatomy. In the only study examining this issue published to date, Kaplan et al. retrospectively analyzed all GIFT and superovulation/IUI cycles at a single university center and found GIFT to be three times more efficient. However, the inherent limitations of a nonrandomized, nonprospective study of this kind are obvious as these authors have suggested. Therefore, it may be wise to consider the use of superovulation before assisted reproductive technologies until this issue is settled. It would be interesting to determine if the high PRs reported for couples with unexplained infertility or mild endometriosis in IVF and GIFT cycles in some centers not incorporating superovulation/IUI protocols would hold up if such an approach was routinely followed. Despite the increasing acceptance of superovulation protocols, we must be aware that many of the studies suggesting a role of hMG in treating ovulatory infertile women with normal pelvic anatomy suffer from deficiencies in experimental design. In a payor-driven system, such as in the United States, the difficulties in designing and carrying out scientifically sound clinical studies examining infertility therapies are obvious. The lack of federal or outside funding for the study of infertility issues contributes to the problem. It is our hope that better designed studies examining the role of superovulation in the treatment of ovulatory infertile women with normal pelvic anatomy will be forthcoming.\r"

Standard intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs), modified to include a tolbutamide injection 20 minutes after IVGTTs, were performed. Polycystic ovarian disease patients were studied in the untreated state, after 6 weeks of ovarian androgen suppression with leuprolide acetate, after a 6-week rest period, and after 6 weeks of antiandrogen therapy with spironolactone. Normal menstruating women were studied during the early follicular, midcycle, and luteal phases of a single cycle. An acute rise in insulin did not alter serum testosterone or androstenedione levels in PCOD or normal women. A significant rise in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate after modified IVGTTs was found in both hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women. Although these results are not supportive of the theory that insulin acts on the ovary to stimulate androgen production, they may be because of the short time course of insulin elevation that occurs during an IVGTT.\r"

Contrary to our hypothesis, amenorrheic runners did not have significant alterations in basal, postexercise, or stimulated hormone levels compared with eumenorrheic runners. In addition, opioid blockade by naloxone did not enhance gonadotropin release by amenorrheic athletes.\r"

During four 6-hour intervals of alternating control and IV P infusion, each subject underwent blood sampling for luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and P every 20 minutes for 24 hours. As a result of the P infusions, mean (+/- SE) P levels rose 72% from a control level of 26.24 +/- 2.13 to 45.22 +/- 3.47 nmol/L, whereas mean LH levels were reduced by 20% from a control level of 4.82 +/- 0.67 to 3.85 +/- 0.66 IU/L. During P infusions, mean LH pulse amplitude was reduced by 33% from 3.33 +/- 0.37 to 2.23 +/- 0.28 IU/L. The mean LH interpulse interval increased by 93% (2.56 +/- 0.14 to 4.92 +/- 0.15/h) when the interval between pulses was interdicted by the onset of P infusion. The infusion of P reduced mean FSH levels by 10% from 3.34 +/- 0.41 to 3.01 +/- 0.35 IU/L. These findings suggest that acute elevations in P levels within the physiological range have a short-term inhibitory effect on gonadotropin secretion during the midluteal phase.\r"

Progesterone concentrations greater than 0.5 ng/mL were associated with a significantly lower rate of pregnancy (12/59, 20%) compared with less than 0.5 ng/mL (40/74, 54%, P less than 0.005).

Ovarian stimulation may cause excessive luteinization and an adverse cycle outcome even in the presence of low LH levels. Prospective use of P levels may be helpful to determine optimal hCG timing.\r"

This analysis looked at endocrine and ultrasound parameters in the late follicular phase of 320 patients in their first cycle of IVF. All cycles were stimulated by an association of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) and human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG). The pregnancy rate (PR) was not related to the E2 pattern in the 5 days before ovulation induction and was 33% and 39% even when E2 values fell during hMG administration. The PR was independent of the E2 level and the number of follicles greater than 14 mm on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration (day 0). The incidence of multiple pregnancy increased when E2 levels were greater than 1,000 pg/mL. It is concluded that follicular phase parameters used for cycle cancellation in hMG-stimulated IVF cycles cannot be extrapolated to GnRH-a/hMG cycles.\r"

Pancreatic amino acid uptake was determined by measuring free plasma amino acid concentration before and during pancreatic stimulation with cerulein (50 ng/kg.h). The administration of this peptide caused a significant decrease (by 14%-20%) in plasma amino acid concentration. Pancreatic polypeptide and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, given at respective doses of 195 pmol/kg.h and 2 micrograms/kg.h, significantly prevented this decrease by 79.3% and 55.8%, respectively. Glucagon, administered at a dose of 7.5 micrograms/kg.h, significantly augmented (by 68.8%) the decreasing effect of cerulein on plasma amino acid concentration. In 2 patients with severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, cerulein had no effect on the concentration of plasma amino acids, whereas the addition of glucagon caused a marked decrease. The results indicate that pancreatic polypeptide and thyrotropin-releasing hormone are able to inhibit plasma amino acid uptake by pancreatic acinar cells; this inhibitory effect could be a mechanism by which these peptides decrease pancreatic enzyme secretion. Glucagon does not seem to affect pancreatic amino acid uptake, at least not under the experimental conditions of this study. The decrease in plasma amino acid concentration following glucagon administration was likely the result of the stimulation of amino acid uptake by extrapancreatic tissues by this peptide.\r"

Results obtained on tumor-bearing mice were compared with results obtained from non-tumor-bearing animals that were either freely fed, food restricted so that their body composition was similar to tumor-bearing animals (pair-weighed), fed a protein-free diet for 5 days, or fasted for 48 hours. Tumor-bearing animals became hypoalbuminemic (33 +/- 5 vs. 44 +/- 3 g/L in freely fed mice), which could be explained by both depressed albumin synthesis (1.95% +/- 0.20% vs. 2.67% +/- 0.27%/h in freely fed mice) and increased albumin degradation. Pair-weighed and protein-calorie malnourished controls had reductions in albumin synthesis (1.81% +/- 0.18% and 1.67% +/- 0.17%/h, respectively) similar to tumor-bearing animals, and the starved controls had the lowest synthetic rates (1.07% +/- 0.10%/h). Albumin degradation was increased only in tumor-bearing animals. Hepatic albumin mRNA in undernourished animals was less (tumor bearing, 32% +/- 5%; pair weighed, 47% +/- 4%; 48 hours fasted, 18% +/- 2%; and protein-calorie malnourished, 26% +/- 3%) than 50% of the mRNA content in the livers of freely fed control mice. Messenger RNA-directed synthesis of albumin in vitro was also depressed to a variable degree in tumor-bearing and malnourished non-tumor-bearing controls. The hypoalbuminemia in tumor-bearing animals could not be prevented by daily injections of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin, 1 microgram/g body wt), but the hepatic acute phase protein serum amyloid P decreased from 157 +/- 12 to 103 +/- 9 micrograms/mL in indomethacin-treated tumor-bearing mice (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that increased albumin degradation seen in tumor-bearing animals cannot be explained by associated malnutrition, whereas tumor-associated malnutrition can explain to a large extent the depressed albumin synthesis. Decreased albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing animals correlated in part with a decreased quantity of liver albumin mRNA. The results of the current study are consistent with either a reduced transcription of the albumin gene or a change in albumin mRNA processing and stability communicated by anorexia and malnutrition.\r"

Total RNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes was reverse transcribed and resultant first strand cDNA was PCR amplified utilizing a concensus primer to the TCR-beta variable region (V beta) and a 3' primer to the TCR-beta constant region (C beta). PCR reaction products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that the patient's in-frame TCR-beta gene rearrangement utilized V beta 6.4, D beta 1.1, J beta 2.2, and C beta 2.1 gene segments. Oligo-primers to V beta 6.4 and J beta 2.2 were utilized to PCR amplify genomic DNA taken from the patient's blood and involved skin. Screening the amplified DNA with an oligo-probe specific for the patient's V-D-J junctional sequences resulted in the detection of the patient-specific sequences. No sequences were detected from DNA from other malignant or benign infiltrates. Thus, we have defined a \"molecular fingerprint\" specific for a patient's malignant T-cells and can molecularly diagnose CTCL through PCR amplification.\r"

Group I (n = 6) underwent sham laparotomy, group II (n = 7) underwent cecal ligation and incision. Untreated intraabdominal sepsis resulted in a progressive decrease in PMN candicidal activity. Concomitant rosetting and phagocytosis assays demonstrated a decrease in both the attachment and phagocytosis of Candida albicans opsonized with both normal and septic swine serum by PMNs in group II. Iodine 125-labeled swine immunoglobulin G (IgG) and fluorescein isothioalanate (FITC)-labeled swine IgG were used to investigate Fc gamma receptor ligand interactions. Scatchard analyses demonstrated a progressive decline in both the binding affinity constant and number of IgG molecules bound per PMN. Stimulation of the oxidative burst markedly reduced 125I-labeled IgG binding in both group I and group II, with a greater decrement being seen in animals with intraabdominal sepsis. Further, in group II, PMN recycling of the Fc gamma receptor to the cell surface after generation of the oxidative burst was reduced by postoperative day 4. Binding of monoclonal antibodies to Fc gamma receptor II, but not Fc gamma receptor I/III markedly reduced intracellular candicidal activity. Immunofluorescence studies revealed a homogeneous pattern of FITC-IgG uptake by nearly all group I PMNs, whereas by postoperative day 8 a substantial number of PMNs from group II failed to internalize the FITC-IgG. These studies suggest that untreated intraabdominal sepsis reduces PMN candicidal activity and that this is due, in part, to altered PMN Fc gamma receptor ligand interactions.\r"

There was only mild intellectual deterioration, but myoclonus, seizures and macular cherry-red spots were never observed. Proton-density and T2-weighted MRI scans showed symmetrical hyperintense lesions of both putamina. No increase of GM1 ganglioside was found in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid, and the metabolism of GM1 ganglioside in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient was also almost normal, although the residual activity of GM1 ganglioside beta-galactosidase activity was only 10% of normal. These findings suggest that impaired GM1 ganglioside metabolism is not present systemically as it is in the infantile and juvenile types of the disorder, but is mainly confined to the central nervous system in chronic GM1 gangliosidosis.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the mechanism of contractive effects in arteries caused by oxyhemoglobin, changes in the concentration of cytosolic calcium [( Ca++]i) before and after exposure to oxyhemoglobin were measured in vitro in cultured vascular smooth-muscle cells obtained from rat aorta. This was accomplished by preloading these cells with a fluorescent intracellular Ca++ probe fura-2/AM. Oxyhemoglobin induced a significant elevation of [Ca++]i in vascular smooth-muscle cells which was sustained for 10 minutes. This response was completely abolished by chelating extracellular calcium with ethyleneglycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA). Oxyhemoglobin induced no accumulation of mass content of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3(1,4,5]. The oxyhemoglobin-induced elevation of [Ca++]i was not blocked by verapamil, a calcium antagonist. Serotonin induced a rapid, transient increase of [Ca++]i followed by a sustained elevation above baseline for 5 minutes. Additions of EGTA or verapamil had a small effect on the peak height of serotonin-induced [Ca++]i elevation, but the [Ca++]i level declined more quickly to the basal level in treated compared with control cells. These results indicate that oxyhemoglobin-induced [Ca++]i elevation is caused by the influx of extracellular calcium, which is independent of the verapamil-blocked voltage-gated calcium channel. The long-lasting high elevation of [Ca++]i caused by oxyhemoglobin suggests that oxyhemoglobin may contribute to the production of abnormal contractions and/or irreversible damage in vascular smooth-muscle cells.\r"

Compared with Cu-adequate controls, glutathione peroxidase activity was lower in liver and plasma of Cu-deficient mice and rats.

This paper discusses why scientifically sound surveys may not be effective and vice versa. Effectiveness depends on the information being relevant to the decision-maker's understanding of the problem to be solved. To the extent that science contributes to both understanding the problem and providing the information for a decision, the survey will be scientific and effective. The measurement of malnutrition and barriers to communication are not at present the major obstacles to effective scientific surveys relative to hunger and malnutrition in the United States. Rather, the obstacles seem to be poor scientific conceptualization and measurement of hunger, on the one hand, and poor sampling techniques for malnutrition, on the other hand. These frontiers of knowledge have implications for science and policy beyond surveys. The challenge for the American Institute of Nutrition is to recruit the scientific skills need to understand hunger and identify pockets of malnutrition and their causes--scientific skills that go beyond those traditionally associated with nutrition research.\r"

We determined, in 29 severely injured hypermetabolic and highly catabolic multiple trauma patients, the plasma level and daily excretion rate of C-peptide, 48-72 hrs postinjury. Data from a set of eight patients who underwent glucose-based total parenteral feeding for 6 days were analyzed for the course of changes in the excretory pattern of C-peptide and catecholamines. The molar ratio of plasma C-peptide to insulin in the trauma patients was similar to that in unstressed controls, indicating that the rate of hepatic insulin extraction is not appreciably altered due to trauma. This is also evident from a significant correlation (p = 0.001) between the plasma C-peptide and insulin levels. The excretion of C-peptide was elevated to three times the normal both in absolute terms and when normalized to creatinine excretion. This was also accompanied by a twofold increase in the plasma levels, indicating an enhanced secretion rate of C-peptide and hence of insulin in response to trauma. Injury-induced insulin resistance does not seem to be due to a decreased insulin secretion. An increase in insulin output would appear to be a significant and desirable response for a continued anabolic stimulus coexistent with the net catabolic phase. Parenteral feeding augmented the excretion of C-peptide and catecholamines and this effect peaked on the fourth day of nutritional therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating monocytes of patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis are triggered to produce interleukin-1 (IL-1) in vivo. Intradialytic induction of IL-1 is associated with complement activation in patients dialyzed with first-use cellulose membranes. Chronic stimulation of IL-1 production occurs because of an yet unidentified mechanism in patients dialyzed with high permeability membranes. The present study demonstrates that intact bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules may cross cuprophan, AN69 and polysulfone membranes under in vitro conditions simulating in vivo hemodialysis. The experiments used purified LPS from Neisseria meningitidis and LPS from Pseudomonas testosteroni, a bacterial strain grown out from a clinically used dialysate. LPS were purified to homogeneity and radiolabeled. Transmembrane passage of 3H-labeled LPS was observed within the first five minutes of dialysis. A total of 0.1 to 1% of 3H-labeled LPS were recovered in the dialysate compartment after one hour of dialysis. High amounts of LPS, representing 40 to 70% of the amount originally present in the dialysate, were absorbed onto high permeability membranes. Low amounts of LPS were absorbed onto cuprophan membranes. The amount of LPS absorbed decreased with the concentration of LPS in the dialysate. LPS recovered from the blood compartment exhibited the same molecular weight as that used to contaminate the dialysate. Biochemically detectable transmembrane passage of LPS was not associated with that of material detectable using the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. An IL-1-inducing activity was, however, detected in the blood compartment upon dialysis with high permeability membranes, as previously found by others with cuprophan membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recognizing the high incidence of RCIN in humans with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), this study was designed to test the hypotheses that dogs with experimental CHF are at increased risk for RCIN and that pharmacologic renal levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) can prevent RCIN in this model. In chronic experiments, three groups of five conscious dogs received intravenous radiocontrast (7 ml/kg). One group consisted of normal controls, while the two other groups had experimental CHF induced by eight days of ventricular pacing at 250 beats per minute. One of the CHF groups received an infusion of ANF (30 ng/kg/min) into the suprarenal aorta for one hour before, during and after the infusion of radiocontrast to achieve pharmacologic renal plasma levels. Renal function remained stable in the normal controls in contrast to the consistent decreases in daily creatinine clearance during the five days following radiocontrast in experimental CHF. In addition, ANF prevented radiocontrast-induced reductions in creatinine clearance in dogs with experimental CHF. Additional studies performed in two groups of anesthetized dogs with experimental CHF demonstrated that, in this model of RCIN, the reduction in renal function appears biphasic, and the action of ANF may be to increase glomerular filtration rate prior to radiocontrast, thus allowing a maintenance of renal function during and after radiocontrast.\r"

Superoxide dismutase, a scavenger of superoxide, or catalase, which destroys hydrogen peroxide, did not protect against endotoxin-induced renal failure. Similarly, neither the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea nor the iron chelator deferoxamine (which presumably would act by preventing the generation of hydroxyl radical via the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction) prevented the endotoxin-induced fall in renal function. In separate experiments, we found no increase in renal cortical lipid peroxidation (a marker of reactive oxygen metabolite-mediated tissue injury) in endotoxin-treated rats, providing further evidence against a role for reactive oxygen metabolites in endotoxin-induced renal injury. Finally, using the aminotriazole-induced inhibition of catalase (a measure of in vivo changes in the hydrogen peroxide generation) we found no evidence of enhanced hydrogen peroxide generation in the renal cortex in endotoxin-treated rats. Taken together, the data from these three separate experimental approaches suggest that reactive oxygen metabolites are not important mediators of endotoxin-induced acute renal failure.\r"

As in rats, infusion of ANP to rabbits resulted in a diuresis, natriuresis, and increase in GFR; however, unlike in rats, the fractional excretion of phosphate (Pi) was not changed. In BBMV prepared from cortices of ANP-infused rabbits, the rate of Na(+)-H+ antiport was decreased (delta -27%), but Na+ gradient-dependent uptakes of Pi and L-proline were not different from controls. Incubation of rabbit cortical tubule suspension in vitro with ANP 10(-7) M alone had no inhibitory effect on Na(+)-H+ antiport in BBMV prepared from these tubules, whereas incubation with other hormonal agents, 1 U/ml PTH (delta 61%) or with dopamine (DA) 10(-4) M (delta -34%), did inhibit the rate of Na(+)-H+ antiport in BBMV from the same pool of tubules. However, when tubules were incubated in the presence of (10(-5) M) DA, the addition of 10(-7) M ANP did cause a significant (delta -21%) decrease in Na(+)-H+ antiport activity in BBMV. In contrast, ANP did not show similar inhibitory effect in the presence of submaximal inhibitory doses of PTH. To explore whether ANP may act on proximal tubules in vivo indirectly, via mediation of DA, we evaluated the effect of ANP on some parameters of catecholamine system in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its administration is often complicated by serious side effects, usually occurring within one to two hours after OKT3 is given, and is termed first-dose reaction. The mechanism underlying these signs and symptoms is poorly defined, but may be related to cytokine release. Twenty-three kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant recipients received OKT3 as treatment of acute rejection. Signs and symptoms occurring after the first dose were observed and quantitated prospectively, and a reaction score was calculated. Blood was drawn immediately before, and at 2 and 24 hours after the first dose of OKT3 for determination of interleukin-2 (IL2), interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) levels, and flow cytometric analysis of T cell subsets. Two groups were defined based on severity of first-dose reaction. Group 1 patients (N = 11) had very mild reactions (reaction score less than or equal to 3); Group 2 patients (N = 12) had more severe reactions (score greater than or equal to 5). All patients demonstrated a significant rise in serum TNF alpha from baseline to two hours after OKT3 (9 +/- 3 pg/ml to 378 +/- 54 pg/ml, P less than 0.0001), and there was significant correlation between reaction scores and two-hour TNF alpha levels (P = 0.005). Group 2 patients had higher TNF alpha levels at two hours than did Group 1 patients (484 +/- 75 pg/ml vs. 263 +/- 62 pg/ml, P = 0.04).

In an initial dose ranging study, successive groups of six kidneys (3 pairs) were randomized to receive each of 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 micrograms/kg/min AP-3 or placebo. Thereafter 20 kidneys (10 pairs) received 0.1 micrograms/kg/min or placebo. There was no discernable effect of AP-3 on allograft creatinine clearance or sodium excretion either when the highest dose of AP-3 was considered alone or when all doses were considered together. Averaged creatinine clearance over the period 0 to 24 hours after transplantation was 20.1 +/- 14.7 ml/min in patients receiving active treatment and 18.2 +/- 13.7 ml/min in those receiving placebo. Thus, despite the documentation of a protective effect of atrial natriuretic factor in animal models of renal ischemia, it is unlikely that intravenous infusion of AP-3 in this dose range will be of benefit in improving immediate renal allograft graft function.\r"

Significant changes were found in nine brain areas of 1K1C and in eight brain areas of 2K1C hypertensive rats. Except undirectional changes in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis and the supraoptic nucleus, ANF concentration was changed in the opposite direction in all other brain areas, with an activation of the central ANF system in 1K1C and an inhibition in 2K1C hypertension. The localization of the alterations (circumventricular organs, anteroventral third ventricle region, hypothalamo hypophyseal system, brain stem) implies major differences in the central regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid homeostasis between these two models. The activation of the central ANF system in 1K1C hypertension may be a compensatory mechanism to prevent further increments in blood pressure and plasma volume. In contrast, the depression of the central ANF system in 2K1C hypertension may promote the elevation of the blood pressure.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of endogenous insulin in the disposal of an oral potassium load in uremia. Experiments were done on male Sprague-Dawley rats. Chronic renal failure (CRF) was induced by 3/4 nephrectomy. The results show that the addition of oral glucose to a potassium load was more effective in the translocation of potassium to the intracellular compartment in uremic animals. Further, suppression of endogenous insulin secretion with somatostatin caused a much higher increase in plasma potassium (K) of uremic rats (1.09 +/- 0.15 mEq/liter in CRF vs. 0.28 +/- 0.03 mEq/liter in control). Experiments to assess the activity of the Na pump were done in soleus muscles derived from these animals. Although a 50% reduction of the basal Na pump activity was found in the uremic muscles, the addition of insulin 100 mU/ml caused a relatively greater stimulation of ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake in the uremic muscle as compared to the control tissue (203% vs. 77% increment). These data suggest a greater sensitivity to insulin action on extrarenal potassium disposal in uremia.\r"

Recently, we and others characterized Fc receptors (Fc gamma R) for IgG-IC on mesangial cells (MC). This study examines regulation of Fc gamma R by cAMP, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and by macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1), an agent controlling Fc gamma R in leukocytes and generated by MC. Preincubation of MC (3rd to 6th subculture) with CSF-1, db-cAMP or IFN-gamma for two to 48 hours resulted in a time dependent (maximal 24 to 48 hrs) two- to threefold increase of specific [125I] IgG-IC binding to MC at 4 degrees C. The increase of Fc receptors induced by CSF-1, db-cAMP or IFN-gamma was confirmed by enhanced binding of the monoclonal anti-Fc receptor antibody 2.4G2 to MC. Uptake of IgG-IC at 37 degrees C was also enhanced in MC pretreated with CSF-1, db-cAMP or IFN-gamma. This indicates that the increase in binding for IgG-IC is associated with functional receptors. Immunoprecipitation of extracts of [125I] surface labeled MC with polyclonal anti-Fc gamma R-Ab followed by SDS-PAGE also showed increased amounts of [125I] Fc gamma R protein after pretreatment with CSF-1, db-cAMP or IFN-gamma. The pretreatment also enhanced staining of MC with anti-Fc gamma R-Ab by immunogold-silver enhancement technique. We conclude that MC express Fc gamma R for IgG-IC that can be regulated by CSF-1, cAMP and IFN-gamma, factors that may be important in glomerular immune injury.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the potential role of leukotrienes in murine lupus, we measured renal hemodynamics and renal leukotriene production in MRL-lpr/lpr mice at 12 and 20 weeks of age. Over this age range, these animals develop overt manifestations of autoimmune disease with nephritis similar to human SLE. In the current study, we demonstrated that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and PAH clearance (CPAH) deteriorated with age in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, but not in MRL(-)+/+ controls. Impaired renal hemodynamic function in MRL-lpr/lpr mice was associated with enhanced ionophore-stimulated production of both leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by preparations of renal cortex. There was a significant inverse correlation between GFR and in vitro production of both LTC4 and LTB4 in kidneys from MRL-lpr/lpr mice, but not in control animals. In addition, in vitro LTC4 production was correlated with the severity of renal histomorphologic abnormalities. Administration of the specific peptidoleukotriene receptor antagonist SKF104353 to 20 week old MRL-lpr/lpr mice significantly improved both GFR and CPAH, whereas this agent had no effect of renal hemodynamics in MRL(-)+/+ controls. These results suggest that renal production of LTC4 and LTB4 is increased in MRL-lpr/lpr mice with nephritis, and that enhanced production of peptidoleukotrienes causes reversible renal dysfunction. Increased leukotriene production within the kidney may therefore be important in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.\r"

We have tested the hypothesis that HgCl2 induces major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in renal parenchymal cells, and studied the kinetics of this induction and its temporal relation to the development of immune complex deposition in the glomeruli. Mice treated with doses of HgCl2 between 2 and 3.2 mg/kg three times for one week had increased renal expression of MHC class I and class II (at the mRNA and the product levels). Class I induction was observed in proximal tubule cells, endothelial cells and glomerular cells. Class II induction was seen mainly in interstitial cells and, to a lesser extent, in tubule cells. Renal MHC expression was maximal at one week, decreased progressively after the second week of HgCl2 administration, and reached basal levels by 23 weeks. In contrast, the amount of lymphocyte infiltration in the kidney increased from the first to the fifth week and was followed by the appearance of glomerular immune deposits from the third week on. Glomerular immune complex deposits were maximal at five weeks and, by 23 weeks, immune deposits in HgCl2-treated mice were only slightly increased over those observed in the sham group. Renal MHC induction by HgCl2 was significantly reduced by treatment with monoclonal antibody against interferon gamma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This has been accompanied by the introduction of a range of new drugs for the treatment of this disorder, and the usage of anti-asthma drugs is increasing. Despite these changes and an increased awareness of the disease, asthma remains the only \"preventable\" disease where the morbidity and mortality are still increasing in most parts of the world. This \"asthma paradox\" requires explanation, and this article is an attempt to provide a plausible scientific one. The hypothesis expresses concern that a long recognised, but little publicised, pharmacological property of the drug class most widely prescribed for the treatment of asthma, the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists--namely, the inhibition of mast-cell degranulation--may be contributing to the world wide increase in morbidity and mortality from asthma via the inhibition of a natural anti-inflammatory mechanism.\r"

Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 induces the production of extracellular matrix proteins by liver cells and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in laboratory animals. TGF alpha is a hepatocyte mitogen that participates in liver regeneration. METHODS. Using Northern blot analysis, we studied the expression of TGF beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in liver specimens from 42 patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and 12 subjects with either normal or fatty livers. The results were correlated with measurements of procollagen Type I mRNA in liver tissue, procollagen Type III peptide in serum, and the degree of histologic injury. We also investigated whether TGF alpha mRNA would be detectable in biopsy specimens of livers with proliferative activity. RESULTS. TGF beta 1 mRNA expression correlated closely with the expression of procollagen Type I mRNA (r = 0.94) and serum procollagen Type III peptide (r = 0.89) and with the histologic activity index (r = 0.73). All patients with increased fibrogenic activity (serum procollagen Type III peptide level, greater than 11.9 micrograms per liter) had increased levels of TGF beta 1 mRNA (2 to 14 times the levels in the control group or in patients with normal fibrogenic activity), and both TGF alpha and H3 histone (a marker of DNA synthesis) mRNAs were detectable in patients with regenerative nodules. Six of eight patients with hepatitis C treated with interferon alfa for one year had sustained clinical responses with normalization of serum procollagen Type III peptide and aminotransferase activity. All these patients had normal levels of TGF beta 1 mRNA in liver specimens obtained at the end of the year. CONCLUSIONS. TGF beta 1 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, and TGF alpha expression may be associated with liver regeneration in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Antibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors that stimulate the thyroid gland cause hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease, and their production during antithyroid drug treatment is an important determinant of the course of the disease. One factor that might contribute to the persistent production of antibodies to TSH receptors is stimulation of the release of thyroid antigens by TSH during antithyroid drug therapy. We therefore studied the effect of the suppression of TSH secretion by thyroxine on the levels of antibodies to TSH receptors after thyroid hormone secretion had been normalized by methimazole. METHODS AND RESULTS. The levels of antibodies to TSH receptors were measured during treatment with methimazole, either alone or in combination with thyroxine, in 109 patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. The patients first received 30 mg of methimazole daily for six months. All were euthyroid after six months, and their mean (+/- SD) level of antibodies to TSH receptors decreased from 64 +/- 9 percent to 25 +/- 15 percent (P less than 0.01; normal, 2.9 +/- 1.4 percent). Sixty patients then received 100 micrograms of thyroxine and 10 mg of methimazole and 49 received placebo and 10 mg of methimazole daily for one year. In the thyroxine-treated group, the mean serum thyroxine concentration increased from 108 +/- 16 nmol per liter to 145 +/- 11 nmol per liter (P less than 0.01), and the level of antibodies to TSH receptors decreased from 28 +/- 10 percent to 10 +/- 3 percent after one month of combination therapy. In the patients who received placebo and methimazole, the mean serum thyroxine concentration decreased and the level of antibodies to TSH receptors did not change. Methimazole, but not thyroxine or placebo, was discontinued in each group 1 1/2 years after the beginning of treatment. The level of antibodies to TSH receptors further decreased (from 6.6 +/- 3.2 percent at the time methimazole was discontinued to 2.1 +/- 1.2 percent one year later) in the patients who continued to receive thyroxine, but it increased (from 9.1 +/- 4.8 percent to 17.3 +/- 5.8 percent during the same period) in the patients who received placebo. One patient in the thyroxine-treated group (1.7 percent) and 17 patients in the placebo group (34.7 percent) had recurrences of hyperthyroidism within three years after the discontinuation of methimazole. CONCLUSIONS. The administration of thyroxine during antithyroid drug treatment decreases both the production of antibodies to TSH receptors and the frequency of recurrence of hyperthyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Primary infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) frequently causes an acute, self-limited viral syndrome. To examine the relations among viral replication, the immune response of the host, and clinical illness during this initial phase of infection, we undertook a quantitative, molecular, and biologic analysis of infectious HIV-1 in the blood and plasma of three patients with symptomatic primary infection and of a sexual partner of one of them. METHODS. During an eight-week period of primary infection, HIV-1 was cultured frequently in dilutions of plasma and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and levels of HIV-1 antigen and antibody were determined sequentially by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. Replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses were cloned and characterized biologically. RESULTS. Six to 15 days after the onset of symptoms, high titers of infectious HIV-1 (from 10 to 10(3) tissue-culture-infective doses per milliliter of plasma) and viral p24 antigen were detected in the plasma of all three patients. These titers fell precipitously by day 27, and the decline coincided with an increase in the levels of antiviral antibodies and the resolution of symptoms. Sequential isolates of virus from plasma and PBMC obtained throughout the period of primary infection, as well as virus derived from two molecular proviral clones, were highly cytopathic for normal-donor PBMC and immortalized T cells, despite the marked reduction in the titers of virus in plasma. CONCLUSIONS. Primary, symptomatic HIV-1 infection is associated with high titers of cytopathic, replication-competent viral strains, and during such infection potential infectivity is enhanced. Effective control of HIV-1 replication during primary infection implies the activation of clinically important mechanisms of immune defense that merit further examination in relation to the development of antiviral therapy and vaccines.\r"

The rapidly evolving clinical picture of primary infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) suggests that a better understanding of the kinetics of viral replication in vivo during the short period before seroconversion may provide insight into the pathogenesis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). METHODS AND RESULTS. Titers of infectious HIV-1 were determined by end-point-dilution culture in sequential samples of plasma and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from four patients with primary infection, with peak titers of 1000 to 10,000 tissue-culture-infective doses per milliliter of plasma and 100 to 10,000 infective doses per 10(6) peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. The high viral burden in mononuclear cells was confirmed by quantitative studies using a polymerase-chain-reaction method. In as little as 10 days, the high HIV-1 load in both plasma and cells decreased spontaneously and precipitously, at least 100-fold, in all four patients. CONCLUSIONS. Although p24 core antigenemia and viral isolation have previously been described during primary HIV-1 infection, this report documents the large viral burden during the acute phase of infection. The rapid and spontaneous decline in the viral load suggests an effective immune response in the host that, if understood, may be used to combat AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocyte-specific tyrosine protein kinase p56lck is physically associated with CD4 and CD8 T-cell surface molecules, suggesting that it may transduce CD4/CD8-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation signals during antigen stimulation. Indeed, antibody-mediated aggregation of CD4 (to mimic interaction with its ligand, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules), rapidly elevates the kinase activity of p56lck and is associated with marked changes in tyrosine protein phosphorylation. Genetic analyses suggest that the interaction of CD4/CD8 with p56lck results in a positive signal during antigen-induced T-cell activation. To evaluate directly the role of p56lck in T-cell activation, we introduced a constitutively activated form of Lck protein (tyrosine 505 to phenylalanine 505 mutant); in a CD4-negative, MHC-class II restricted mouse T-cell hybridoma. We report here that, as for transfection of CD4, expression of the Lck mutant enhanced T-lymphocyte responsiveness. This finding provides direct evidence that p56lck can positively regulate T-cell functions and that it mediates at least some of the effects of CD4 and CD8 on T-cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclic AMP is thought to act as an intracellular second messenger, mediating the physiological response of many cell types to extracellular signals. In the pituitary, growth hormone (GH)-producing cells (somatotrophs) proliferate and produce GH in response to hypothalamic GH-releasing factor, which binds a receptor that stimulates Gs protein activation of adenylyl cyclase. We have now determined whether somatotroph proliferation and GH production are stimulated by cAMP alone, or require concurrent, non-Gs-mediated induction of other regulatory molecules by designing a transgene to induce chronic supraphysiological concentrations of cAMP in somatotrophs. The rat GH promoter was used to express an intracellular form of cholera toxin, a non-cytotoxic and irreversible activator of Gs. Introduction of this transgene into mice caused gigantism, elevated serum GH levels, somatotroph proliferation and pituitary hyperplasia. These results support the direct triggering of these events by cAMP, and illustrate the utility of cholera toxin transgenes as a tool for physiological engineering.\r"

  ".W": "Fetal plasma ferritin concentrations were measured in 43 normal fetuses at 18-36 weeks and in 78 blood samples collected before transfusion from 23 fetuses with Rh alloimmunization. Among controls, there was a significant correlation between fetal serum ferritin and gestational age (r = 0.39, P = .009), consistent with an increase in fetal storage of iron during normal pregnancy. In Rh-alloimmunized fetuses, the ferritin concentration was above the reference range in 63% of the samples. Before the first transfusion, the fetal ferritin concentration was increased compared with controls (mean multiples of the mean = 2.6, range 1-26) and showed a negative correlation with fetal hematocrit (r = -0.43, P less than .05), suggesting that the worse the fetal anemia, the higher the iron store. Serial transfusions were associated with further increase in serum ferritin, which correlated primarily with the total volume of blood transfused. Three fetuses had plasma serum ferritin concentrations above 1 mg/L, a level compatible with a diagnosis of iron overload in children. These observations suggest that there is a potential risk of iron overload in Rh-alloimmunized fetuses undergoing intrauterine blood transfusion.\r"

Quantitative counts of these organisms demonstrated high caries risk due to streptococci in 66% and due to lactobacilli in 100% of patients studied. Use of chlorhexidine rinse was shown to reduce S. mutans counts 1.1 logs and lactobacilli 1.1 logs. The use of chlorhexidine gel resulted in a reduction of S. mutans 1.2 logs and lactobacilli 2.2 logs. In the subjects using the rinse, caries risk due to streptococci was reduced to low levels in 44% and due to lactobacilli in only one subject, with reduction to moderate risk in one third and no change in risk in the remaining patients. The use of chlorhexidine gel was found to reduce the caries risk associated with streptococci to low levels in all patients, and the risk associated with lactobacilli to low and moderate risk in two thirds of patients.\r"

We reviewed the records of 66 patients with laboratory diagnosis of one of the aforementioned abnormalities to determine whether they bled excessively after challenges to hemostasis such as dental extractions. Only three of them bled excessively, but two of these had other concomitant causes that could explain bleeding. Hence the dentist should not give up dental extractions or other surgical procedures when results of hemostasis tests are grossly abnormal, because these are not necessarily associated with abnormal hemostasis. Obviously, the correct interpretation of abnormal hemostasis values warrants close collaboration and reciprocal consultation between the dentist and the hematologist.\r"

Persistent radiolucency surrounding formocresol implants and sequestration of Kri-paste implants were noted in contrast to apparent bony healing around the zinc oxide-eugenol controls and those implants containing glutaraldehyde. These results suggest a greater tissue tolerance to glutaraldehyde-containing agents in contrast to the more traditional endodontic agents used in deciduous teeth.\r"

Both of these problems can be significantly reduced if, during the initial surgery, the posterior canal wall is taken down and the tympanic membrane and external auditory canal skin are removed for better exposure of the eustachian tube orifice. The external auditory meatus can then be sealed by a previously described modification of the Rambo procedure. This additional procedure adds about 20 minutes to the surgery and presents a small risk of retained squamous epithelium. Fifty consecutive patients were divided into two equal groups and studied retrospectively. In group I, the patients underwent a modified Rambo meatoplasty at the time of the removal of their translabyrinthine tumor, whereas patients in group II had the tympanic orifice of their eustachian tube obstructed through the facial recess. Review of the postoperative course of these fifty patients indicated that the addition of the modified Rambo meatoplasty was justified by the overall reduction in morbidity and expense it provided.\r"

A new method of measuring eye velocity asymmetry from VAT data is presented, based on computer estimation of the 0th harmonics of discrete Fourier spectra over short segments of digital eye and head velocity records. Eye asymmetries greater than a 3% normal range are shown to be directionally correlated with the side of the lesions in patients with unilateral labyrinthectomies. Among patients with a diagnosis of acoustic neuroma, who were tested preoperatively with the VAT, nine of nine patients showed eye asymmetries greater than 3% toward the side of the neuroma. Those patients with acoustic neuromas who have sufficiently vigorous high-frequency head responses showed mean percentages of eye asymmetry that were linearly correlated with the size of the acoustic neuroma. These results suggest that VAT high-frequency asymmetry provides a useful method of diagnostic evaluation of the side and extent of unilateral peripheral lesions.\r"

This represented 10% of our total series of cholesteatomas in adults and children (426 ears). Clinical presentation, extent of disease, results of fistula testing and audiometric studies, and radiographic findings were analyzed. A canal wall-down procedure was performed in all but one patient. Generally an attempt was made to completely remove the cholesteatoma, to graft the fistulous area, and to reconstruct the middle ear mechanism in one stage. The matrix was preserved in patients with large fistulas where the involved ear was the only hearing one, when the matrix was adherent to the underlying optic duct, and in selected elderly persons. Long-term followup did not reveal a significant difference in hearing, degree of vertigo, or incidence of recidivism when those patients in whom the matrix was removed were compared with those in whom the matrix was preserved. The importance of recognizing the presence of a labyrinthine fistula preoperatively is stressed, along with the need to be prepared for an unexpected fistula. Operative management is described.\r"

In contrast to facial nerve schwannomas, these are extraneural tumors that cause symptoms by compression and tend to produce deficits when very small in size. We report our experience at the House Ear Clinic with 34 patients having these nonglomus intratemporal vascular tumors. Hemangiomas arising in the internal auditory canal tend to produce a progressive sensorineural hearing loss and are demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas those at the geniculate ganglion are usually first seen with facial nerve symptoms and may require high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) for detection. Facial electromyography is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Because of their extraneural nature, early diagnosis can permit removal of the tumor with preservation of facial nerves in some patients.\r"

We identified 14 patients with sufficient cis-platinum-induced sensorineural hearing loss to evaluate a plateau limit to hearing loss over the 4 to 8 kHz range. Half of these 14 patients had hearing losses that exceeded the plateau level. More severe 4 to 8 kHz hearing losses did not correlate with number of treatments, cumulative dosages of cis-platinum, pre-existing hearing loss, radiation therapy, other chemotherapeutic agents, or even hearing losses below 4 kHz. Although cis-platinum therapy can induce a plateau of moderate hearing impairment for some patients over the 4 to 8 kHz range, a significant proportion of patients will experience more severe hearing impairment in this range, even after only one or two courses of cis-platinum.\r"

It is not known if vestibular compensation after labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy differs. We have addressed this question by examining the pattern of recovery of the vestibular ocular reflex in cats after either labyrinthectomy or vestibular neurectomy. Temporal bone histologic examination confirmed the surgical lesion. Our results demonstrate a reduction of the long time constant of the vestibular ocular reflex in both groups of animals. Although gain of the vestibular ocular reflex recovered substantially, it never returned to control levels in either group. In general, animals that had undergone vestibular neurectomy demonstrated greater vestibular ocular reflex asymmetries than did labyrinthectomized animals. The recovery pattern of the vestibular ocular reflex indicates vestibular compensation is more rapid after labyrinthectomy than after vestibular neurectomy. We believe this result is related to survival of the vestibular nerve after labyrinthectomy, but not after vestibular neurectomy, suggesting that the vestibular nerve can contribute to the adaptive response after labyrinthectomy.\r"

In this study, the intrinsic vasculature of the human facial nerve was systematically evaluated in 25 temporal bones and three fresh cadaver nerves. Cross-sectional vessel counts were obtained for the labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments. Capillary densities for each segment were derived from these data. The labyrinthine segment of the human facial nerve, like that in the cat, contains fewer and smaller intrinsic blood vessels than do the mastoid and tympanic segments. This may indicate that the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve may be more vulnerable to ischemic damage. In conjunction with the previously demonstrated narrowness of the labyrinthine fallopian canal, these findings support the contention that the labyrinthine segment is a likely site of lesion in Bell's palsy.\r"

Material from 12 glomus tumors was studied by means of electron microscopic and immunohistochemical techniques to determine whether there was an association between tumor size, patient age, and the neuroendocrine functions of these tumors. Electronmicroscopic evaluation (seven tumors) revealed a highly variable concentration of neurosecretory granules. Immunohistochemical staining (nine tumors) demonstrated that glomus tumors do arise from neural ectoderm and that they all contain serotonin. The concentration of serotonin seems to correlate with the concentration of neurosecretory granules seen on electronmicroscopy. In addition, higher levels of serotonin were found in two patients who were in their late sixties. It is possible that some of the neuroendocrine activity associated with glomus tumors could be the result of the release of serotonin.\r"

The treatment for cholesteatoma is complete surgical excision when possible, whereas cholesterol granuloma needs only adequate drainage for control. A new transcanal infracochlear approach for drainage of cholesterol granuloma involving the anterior petrous apex is described. Absolute measurements from 10 cadaveric temporal bones were obtained to determine the distances between the cochlea, jugular bulb, carotid artery, and facial nerve. In all specimens the petrous apex was entered without invading the cochlea, carotid, or jugular bulb. Advantages of this technique include a more direct route to the petrous apex, dependent drainage, and preservation of the normal hearing mechanism, including the tympanic membrane. Clinical indications for this technique include failure of other treatment approaches and a high jugular bulb obstructing an infralabyrinthine approach. Experience to date shows that patients experience little difficulty from the procedure.\r"

The group data show that the speech perception scores of the subjects with hearing aids were significantly higher than those of the subjects with implants on a range of speech perception measures. Although a few subjects with implants achieved scores as high as those who used hearing aids, the majority did not. Even though the children with implants receive substantial benefit from their devices, they continue to have limited auditory perception abilities relative to their peers who derive benefit from conventional hearing aids. The data highlight the importance of establishing hearing aid benefit in potential candidates for implant.\r"

Nine of the eleven patients showed increased signal intensity of their facial nerve with gadolinium-enhanced MRI. In all nine patients, the facial nerve was involved at the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic portions of the facial nerve, while two of the nine patients also had involvement of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve. Patients whose facial nerve enhancement was limited to the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic facial nerve ultimately had complete return of facial function. Patients whose facial nerve enhanced in the mastoid segment experienced incomplete return of facial function. Gadolinium is effective in localizing the site of inflammation during facial paralysis. Those patients with enhancement localized to the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic segments were more likely to regain complete facial function. In contrast, patients who had enhancement of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve had poorer prognoses for complete return of facial function.\r"

We postulate that the resulting solid canal \"plug\" prevents endolymph movement within the posterior canal, which effectively fixes the cupula. This selectively abolishes the receptivity of the posterior canal to both angular acceleration and gravity without influencing the other inner ear receptors. We previously reported the success of this procedure in two patients with BPPV and a co-existing profound sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear. Since that report, a slightly modified technique has been used to occlude six more posterior canals--five in normal hearing ears. While our follow-up times range from only 3 to 18 months, all eight patients continue to be relieved of their BPPV. Temporary mixed hearing losses occurred in three of the five ears with normal preoperative hearing. Hearing in all five patients ultimately returned to the preoperative state. We believe this procedure is a simpler and safer alternative to singular neurectomy for the treatment of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.\r"

After treatment in a variety of surgical and radiotherapeutic combinations, the 5-year cure rates were: 70%, 70%, 50%, and 9%, respectively. Thirty-four patients, seen between 1980 and 1989, were placed in a new prospective protocol for combined surgery and postoperative irradiation. These patients were subdivided into the same subgroups on the basis of tumor location. The surgical procedures were formalized to be more encompassing (i.e., external canal tumors were treated by sleeve resection of the internal auditory canal and tympanic membrane, superficial invasion by superficial temporal bone resection, deep tumors by radical temporal bone resection, and those beyond the temporal bone by an infratemporal fossa approach). Radical neck dissections were performed where needed. The irradiation dosage was increased to 6250+ cGy, with a 4:1 ratio in favor of electrons for deeper penetration, and the fields were widened. At 36.6-month average followup, the cure rates were: 100%, 100%, 70%, and 65%, respectively. Six of ten patients with neck metastases at presentation had tumor recurrence or distant disease (60%).\r"

For example, cochlear removal in birds and mammals results in a reduction in central auditory neuron cell size within 48 hours. A similar decrease in cell size after pharmacologic blockade of auditory nerve electrical activity with tetrodotoxin has been reported. In the present study, we evaluate the reversibility of central auditory changes after a profound sensorineural hearing loss caused by blockade of auditory nerve actions potentials. Tetrodotoxin, which blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, was embedded in a slow-release vehicle and placed next to the round window membrane of gerbils. Tetrodotoxin diffused into perilymph and unilaterally blocked electrical activity in auditory nerve axons. Electrical activity blockade was confirmed with recordings of auditory brainstem response. Animals were killed immediately after 24 hours of electrical blockade or 7 days after a transient 24- or 48-hour blockade. Large spherical cells of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus ipsilateral to manipulation were measured and compared to large spherical cells on the opposite, unmanipulated side of the brain. Animals killed immediately after a 24-hour blockade of electrical activity showed a mean decrease of 16% in cell size ipsilateral to the blockade (p less than 0.05). In animals allowed to recover for 7 days after blockade for 24 or 48 hours, cell size returned to previous levels. There was no longer a consistent difference in cell size between the two sides of the brain in these animals (p greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-nine patients with bilateral vestibular paresis were evaluated. The diagnosis was based on caloric responses of less than 5 degrees/sec in both ears and reduced gain on rotary chair trials. Oscillopsia occurred in the minority of patients (35%) and was rare unless severe paresis was present. Episodic vertigo occurred in 43%. All patients had abnormal posturography results, with vestibular dysfunction and severe dysfunction patterns predominating. The treatment outcomes of 22 patients who underwent vestibular rehabilitation are discussed. Prevention of bilateral vestibular paresis remains a high priority.\r"

Specific immunoreactivity was observed in the crista ampullaris, but not in the endolymphatic sac.

To address these issues, we retrospectively reviewed 118 patients who underwent vestibular neurectomy between October 1984 and January 1988. Forty-two patients who underwent a retrolabyrinthine approach and 44 patients who underwent a retrosigmoid approach completed a written questionnaire and provided a recent audiogram. According to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, complete or substantial vertigo control was achieved and maintained in 95% of patients in both surgical groups. Hearing, tinnitus, and fullness results over the long term are variable. The advantages and disadvantages of the various vestibular neurectomy approaches will be detailed. On review of our results and surgical experience, we now prefer the retrosigmoid approach.\r"

A dilemma arises when it is not possible to remove the entire tumor without incurring additional neurologic deficits. Twenty patients who underwent intentional incomplete surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma to avoid further neurologic deficit were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into a subtotal group (resection of less than 95% of tumor) and a near-total group (resection of 95% or more of tumor) and were followed yearly with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The subtotal group was planned and consisted of elderly patients (mean age, 68.5 years) with large tumors (mean, 3.1 cm). The near-total group consisted of younger patients (mean age, 45.8 years) and smaller tumors (mean, 2.3 cm). The mean length of followup for all patients was 5.0 years. Ninety percent of patients had House grade I or II facial function post-operatively. Radiologically detectable tumor regrowth occurred in only one patient, who was in the subtotal resection group. Near-total resection of acoustic tumor was not associated with radiologic evidence of regrowth of tumor for the period of observation. Within the limits of the follow-up period of this study, subtotal resection of acoustic neuroma in elderly patients was not associated with clinically significant recurrence in most patients and produced highly satisfactory rates of facial preservation with low surgical morbidity.\r"

Clones of marked cells were generated by excisional recombination within a chromosomally integrated copy of the silent reporter. By the reverse reaction, integration of transfected DNA was targeted to a specific chromosomal site.

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested the existence of a tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome region 5q21. DNA probes from this region were used to study a panel of sporadic colorectal carcinomas. One of these probes, cosmid 5.71, detected a somatically rearranged restriction fragment in the DNA from a single tumor. Further analysis of the 5.71 cosmid revealed two regions that were highly conserved in rodent DNA. These sequences were used to identify a gene, MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer), which encodes an 829-amino acid protein with a short region of similarity to the G protein-coupled m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The rearrangement in the tumor disrupted the coding region of the MCC gene. Moreover, two colorectal tumors were found with somatically acquired point mutations in MCC that resulted in amino acid substitutions. MCC is thus a candidate for the putative colorectal tumor suppressor gene located at 5q21. Further studies will be required to determine whether the gene is mutated in other sporadic tumors or in the germ line of patients with an inherited predisposition to colonic tumorigenesis.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effects of breathing 35% stable xenon in 65% oxygen on regional cerebral blood flow and the electroencephalogram in 20 normal volunteers. We measured blood flow in 32 brain regions over both hemispheres with the xenon-133 intravenous injection technique in two protocols. In the first protocol (n = 10), a baseline study was followed by a second study during 5 minutes of breathing stable xenon; in the other protocol (n = 8), the baseline study was followed by a second study after 5 minutes of breathing stable xenon. Two volunteers were excluded due to excessive movements during the inhalation of stable xenon. Some of the remaining 18 volunteers had varying alterations of consciousness accompanied by electroencephalogram changes. After stable xenon inhalation the electroencephalogram returned to normal within 2-3 minutes. During stable xenon inhalation mean +/- SD PECO2 dropped significantly from 39.4 +/- 4.4 to 33.3 +/- 5.4 mm Hg in the first protocol and from 39.4 +/- 2.6 to 34.8 +/- 4.1 mm Hg in the second protocol due to hyperventilation in 13 volunteers. Mean regional cerebral blood flow increased significantly by 13.5-25.4% without correction for PECO2. In the first protocol regional cerebral blood flow increased by greater than 12% in 11-14 (depending on the flow parameter) of the 20 hemispheres. In the second protocol regional cerebral blood flow increased by greater than 12% in 9-13 of the 16 hemispheres. We conclude that cautious interpretation is necessary in the assessment of regional cerebral blood flow with 35% xenon-enhanced computed tomography.\r"

For all strokes we identified the following risk factors: a history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; the presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular hypertrophy; a glycosylated hemoglobin A1 concentration of greater than 9.1%; a fasting plasma glucose concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 6.0 mmol/l; a serum triglyceride concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 2.1 mmol/l; and a serum lipoprotein(a) concentration of greater than 29.2 mg/dl. We found the following protective factors: a serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration of greater than 1.59 mmol/l and a serum apolipoprotein A-I concentration of greater than or equal to 106 mg/dl. The patterns of risk factors differed among the three stroke subtypes. When significant risk factors were entered into a multiple logistic regression model, we found a history of hypertension, a high serum lipoprotein(a) concentration, and a low apolipoprotein A-I concentration to be independent risk factors for all strokes. The attributable risk for hypertension was estimated to be 24% in patients aged greater than or equal to 60 years. In this population, in which cerebrovascular diseases are the third commonest cause of mortality, identification of risk factors will allow further studies in risk factor modification for the prevention of stroke.\r"

  ".W": "Free radicals and lipid peroxidation of membrane fatty acids are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of arterial vasospasm and the physiopathologic patterns of neuronal damage after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We have evaluated the effects of treatment with either high-dose methylprednisolone every 8 hours or a single dose of U74006F on the temporal profile of ex vivo synthesis of four selected eicosanoids in brain slices after experimental induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. Prostaglandins D2 and E2, prostacyclin and leukotriene C4 levels were determined by radioimmunoassay after 1-hour incubation of the brain slices. The synthesis of prostaglandin D2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha at 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage was significantly higher when compared to sham-operated animals (p = 0.01); prostaglandin E2 release was significantly enhanced at 6 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage (p = 0.01). The release of the lipoxygenase metabolite was significantly enhanced at 1, 6, and 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage induction. Both treatment regimens significantly reduced the ex vivo synthesis of prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene C4 at 1, 6, and 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage, whereas the effects on 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis differed in the two treatment groups. U74006F enhanced the synthesis of prostacyclin metabolite in the early phase after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and high-dose methylprednisolone reduced the increasing synthesis at 48 hours. A strict comparison between the two treatments was not possible because of the different modalities of administration. However, these data suggest that the antioxidant effect of single-dose treatment with U74006F influenced the early and delayed effects on enzymatic lipid peroxidation, whereas the effects of methylprednisolone administration every 8 hours were more significant in the delayed phase.\r"

  ".W": "While the in vitro reactivity of cerebral conducting vessels following subarachnoid hemorrhage has been extensively studied, in vivo cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity has not been systematically investigated. We tested the hypothesis that, in the canine model of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the rise in cerebral blood flow normally seen with hypercapnia is blunted during delayed vasospasm. Four groups of animals were studied: one received two 4-ml subarachnoid injections of nonheparinized arterial blood into the cisterna magna (n = 8), one received three subarachnoid injections of 5 ml blood (n = 5), one received two subarachnoid injections of 4 ml saline (n = 5), and a control group (n = 5) had no subarachnoid injections or angiography. Basilar artery diameter was measured from baseline and follow-up angiography. We determined CO2 reactivity by randomly varying the concentration of inspired CO2 and measuring regional cerebral blood flow with radiolabeled microspheres. Basilar artery diameter was not affected by saline injection and was reduced by 26 +/- 2.9% in the two-hemorrhage group and 55 +/- 1.9% in the three-hemorrhage group. Baseline cerebral blood flow and CO2 reactivity were similar in all four groups. We conclude that, in this model of delayed vasospasm, regional cerebral vascular CO2 reactivity is intact and extrapolation of in vitro data regarding basilar artery diameter and reactivity to cerebral blood flow must be done cautiously.\r"

In our present study, radioimmunoassay with anti-porcine endothelin antiserum revealed that endothelin, produced by cerebral microvessel endothelia grown on a filter, is released mainly to the basement membrane side, not the vascular lumen side. This finding suggests that endothelin constricts arterioles locally where it is produced by endothelia. We also found that cerebral microvessel endothelia produce less endothelin under low oxygen pressure and more endothelin under low carbon dioxide pressure. Our results suggest that endothelin has a role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow in response to oxygen and carbon dioxide pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Red cells preserved in extended-storage media are the standard product dispensed by many regional blood centers. When the red cells are intended for neonatal transfusion, concern exists about the safety of the relatively high quantities of additives present in these media. Definitive studies to address these concerns are not available. Therefore, to estimate the effects of additives and to delineate circumstances in which they might be harmful, the quantities transfused in defined clinical settings were calculated, and the following recommendations are offered for transfusing infants less than 4 months of age. First, red cells preserved in extended-storage media should present no substantive risks when used for small-volume (approximately 10 mL/kg) transfusions of premature infants and can be used without additional processing. Second, the risks of the most premature neonatal patients or those with severe renal and/or hepatic insufficiency cannot be defined clearly, and, because data are not available to ensure safety for these infants, removal of the additive medium and resuspension of the red cells in saline or albumin solution immediately before transfusion are recommended. Third, following a similar rationale, it seems prudent to avoid using entire units of red cells preserved in extended-storage media in massive transfusion settings (e.g., exchange transfusion, cardiac surgery, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). In these settings, the preservative medium should be removed and the red cells resuspended in the fluid that is most appropriate for the procedure that is planned. It must be emphasized that these recommendations are based on calculations and hypothetical settings, not actual data. Accordingly, they are tentative and should be altered as definitive information becomes available.\r"

The RBCs also did not react on direct bromelin and direct Polybrene tests. However, an \"hrB-like\" antibody was eluted from the RBCs of both patients. The sera from these patients reacted with all e+ hrB+ RBCs but not with e+ hrB-, e-, or their own RBCs. The antibody in the serum of one patient was not adsorbed by R2R2 RBCs. Serologic tests initially suggested (by direct testing and adsorption studies) that the serum antibodies were alloantibodies rather than autoantibodies. RBCs taken from one patient, 8 months after her sample was first referred to our laboratory, reacted with a serum sample from her first admission. An RBC sample taken from the other patient, initially typed e+ and hrB- but 1 month later typed e+ and hrB+ by using the same anti-hrB sera, was used to test the earlier samples.\r"

When standard methods were used, an average of 30.6 minutes was needed to complete the three scenarios, with an accuracy of 73%; by contrast, use of programmable calculator resulted in a significant decline in time needed to calculate doses (an average of only 8.5 minutes), with an improved accuracy of 98%. The use of a programmable calculator can result in a significant improvement in both speed and accuracy of drug and fluid selection and dosage and rate calculations, regardless of the level of the subject's medical training.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: A group of young patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events, endocardial lesions, and lupus anticoagulant is described in order to highlight the common clinical laboratory features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients (10 females, age range 17 to 53 years [mean 38 years]) at onset of symptoms of cerebral ischemia who had evidence of the lupus anticoagulant syndrome and were being followed prospectively are reviewed. All patients had abnormal phospholipid-dependent coagulation test results, and most had anticardiolipin antibody at the time of presentation. Three of 14 had four or more American Rheumatism Association criteria for definite systemic lupus erythematosus and the remaining patients were considered to have primary lupus anticoagulant syndrome. RESULTS: The common features among these patients included at least one cerebral ischemic event at presentation (stroke or transient ischemic attack), or recurrent episodes suggesting cerebral ischemia (amaurosis fugax, recurrent severe migraine headaches), livedo reticularis, endocardial valvular lesions noted on echocardiography (11 mitral, two aortic valve) that were often associated with discrete vegetations, retinal vascular lesions, and computed tomographic/magnetic resonance imaging scanning or angiographic evidence of multiple cerebral infarction. Venous thromboembolic events were uncommon (three of 14). Common laboratory studies included thrombocytopenia (10 of 14), positive direct Coombs' test result (11 of 14), and hypocomplementemia (11 of 14). Follow-up after initial treatment with either salicylates or anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) for up to 10 years indicated that while many patients had recurrent symptoms suggesting cerebral ischemia, major stroke syndromes did not recur nor new episodes emerge. CONCLUSION: The combination of multiple cerebral ischemic lesions and endocardial lesions, including valvular vegetations, suggests that these cerebral ischemic events represent cerebral emboli, and that these cerebral embolic events originate from vegetative lesions on the mitral or, less commonly, aortic valve, in association with lupus anticoagulant.\r"

The total polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were not significantly different between nonpregnant and normal pregnant patients but was significantly lower in the preeclamptic patients compared with normal pregnant patients. This decreased level could represent altered fatty acid metabolism or altered storage and mobilization from lipid pools. Compared with nonpregnant patients, normal pregnant patients had significantly higher levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid. This may reflect normal physiologic changes in pregnancy, and the decreased level of eicosapentaenoic acid seen in preeclamptic patients may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.\r"

Patients were randomized to inpatient treatment with either cefoxitin and doxycycline (n = 75) or clindamycin and tobramycin (n = 73). These antibiotics were administered intravenously for at least 4 days, and up to 48 hours beyond defervescence. Patients were discharged on a regimen of oral doxycycline or clindamycin in accordance with the intravenous regimen to complete a total duration of therapy of 2 weeks. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (53%) and Chlamydia trachomatis (31%) were the microorganisms that were isolated most frequently from the genital tract of enrolled patients. At follow-up, N. gonorrhoeae was isolated in two patients, and C. trachomatis was isolated in none. The overall initial favorable response rate to combination antimicrobial therapy was 98.5% (130/132) in patients with uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease and 81% (13/16) in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease that was complicated by tuboovarian abscess. A greater than 70% decrease in abdominal tenderness score occurred in 89% of 111 patients within 6 weeks of hospital discharge. There were no significant differences between antibiotic treatment groups in any response categories or in toxicity. During the initial hospitalization, five patients (three with tuboovarian abscess; one with a pyosalpinx, and one with intractable acute and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease) required surgical intervention. These results support the recommendation to use broad-spectrum combination antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.\r"

The menstrual blood loss during two control periods in 15 women subsequently treated with flurbiprofen and tranexamic acid was 295 +/- 52 ml and 203 +/- 25.2 ml in the 16 women later fitted with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device. Menstrual blood loss was reduced by all three forms of treatment. The reduction in menstrual blood loss expressed as a percentage of the mean of two control cycles for each form of treatment was as follows: flurbiprofen, 20.7% +/- 9.9%; tranexamic acid, 44.4% +/- 8.3%; levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device after 3 months, 81.6% +/- 4.5%; levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device after 6 months, 88.0% +/- 3.1%; levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device after 12 months, 95.8% +/- 1.2%. The reduction in menstrual blood loss achieved by the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device was greater than that recorded with flurbiprofen (p less than 0.001) and tranexamic acid (p less than 0.01), and was greater for tranexamic acid when compared with flurbiprofen (p less than 0.05). The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device was the only form of treatment to reduce mean menstrual blood loss below 80 ml per menstruation, the upper limit of normal menstrual blood loss.\r"

  ".U": "91166012\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND: Alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) replacement therapy is an expensive intervention ($20,000-$30,000 per patient annually) which may slow or arrest the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in AAT-deficient patients. While FDA-approved, therapy efficacy is unknown. The costs and benefits of AAT replacement therapy were evaluated for patients with congenital COPD. METHODS: Epidemiological and disease cost data were taken from published sources. A discrete-time model of disease stage probability transition was developed to calculate the present-value expected cost of disease treatment, under a range of possible therapy efficacy and other parameter values. RESULTS: At an efficacy of 70 percent, the cost per life year saved with AAT replacement therapy would be between $28,000 and $72,000 (1990 US dollars), depending on patient age, sex, and smoking status. At 30 percent efficacy, the cost per life year saved range would be between $50,000 and $128,000. A controlled efficacy study would cost $53 million or less, if the true efficacy were 50 percent or better. CONCLUSIONS: With efficacy of 30 percent or higher, therapy cost-effectiveness would be comparable to other widely used medical interventions. The economic assessment methodology was used to evaluate both the therapeutic innovation and the value of additional clinical research.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of multiple clinical variables to predict an increased or decreased probability of pelvic pathology, therefore determining when a pelvic examination is needed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: An urban emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: 246 female patients presenting with abdominal pain and undergoing pelvic examination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 99 patients without pelvic pathology (40%) and group 2 consisted of 147 patients with pelvic pathology (60%). Pelvic pathology was defined as presence of infective discharge (with confirmation on wet mount/potassium hydroxide smear), presence of adnexal mass and/or tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, uterine enlargement and/or tenderness, blood in the vaginal vault, and culture report positive for Neisseria gonorrhea. The following variables achieved statistical significance (P less than .05) using a logistic regression model: history of vaginal discharge (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.32]); history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia (4.35 [1.52 to 12.40]); right upper quadrant pain on physical examination (0.33 [0.13 to 0.85]); and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination or history (1.73 [0.94 to 3.19]). CONCLUSION: History of vaginal discharge, history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia, and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination act as risk variables predicting presence of pelvic disease. Right upper quadrant pain on physical examination acts as a protective variable to predict absence of pelvic disease. This information may aid the emergency physician in determining the need for a pelvic examination in women with abdominal pain.\r"

  ".U": "91166142\r", 
  ".W": "Dog mastocytomas (anatomic and biochemical features comparable to normal dog and human mast cells) were used to study actions of mast cell mediators on several airway effector systems. We showed mastocytoma cell adherence to both cultured tracheal epithelial cells and tracheal tissue sections for greater than 48 h that was abolished completely by pretreatment of mast cells with proteases. This mast cell-epithelial cell adhesion-interaction reaction is probably mediated by a mast cell plasma membrane protein. Mast cell mediators stimulate short circuit current and ion flux across dog tracheal epithelia mounted in Ussing chambers. Pretreatment of epithelia with indomethacin blocks this effect, probably by inhibiting LTC4-induced activation of epithelial cyclooxygenases. Mastocytoma cells also increase secretion from cultured serous submucosal gland cells. Blockade of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways in mastocytoma cells activated by calcium ionophore does not alter secretion of the serous cells induced by mastocytoma supernatant, but secretion induced by mastocytoma supernatant or purified mast cell chymase is markedly reduced by an inhibitor of chymase. These results suggest that mast cells can alter airway secretions not only by actions on ion flux in epithelial cells but also by actions on submucosal gland secretion; this latter action appears to be mediated by mast cell chymase. Finally, supernatants from mastocytoma cells stimulated by calcium ionophore greatly increase the sensitivity and magnitude of the contractile response of dog bronchial smooth muscle to histamine. These effects are blocked by an inhibitor of mast cell tryptase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91166145\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary epithelial cells may be primarily responsible for initiating or regulating inflammatory responses in the airways, in part by releasing chemical mediators. Among the most potent mediators of inflammation are the lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, including the leukotrienes and other mono and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETES). The human airway epithelium contains significant 15-lipoxygenase activity. Although some biologic functions of 15-lipoxygenase metabolites are known, further understanding of the role of this enzyme in the airway requires localization in tissue and studies of expression, regulation, and biologic activity. Towards these aims, we purified and characterized 15-lipoxygenase from eosinophil-enriched leukocytes. First, we studied cofactors that may be involved in regulating enzymatic activity. Second, we isolated to homogeneity, for the first time, human 15-lipoxygenase. This led to the determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence and the discovery of homology among various mammalian lipoxygenases. Finally, we utilized this structural information to isolate a cDNA that encodes for human 15-lipoxygenase. The availability of a clone will permit studies of expression and the development of antibodies for tissue localization. Further research using molecular and antibody probes is expected to increase our understanding of the biologic roles of 15-lipoxygenase in airway epithelium.\r"

Pulmonary artery infusion of oleic acid (PAIOA), 0.1 ml/kg, was used to cause lung injury. Ten dogs were randomized into two groups (Gps): Gp I (n = 5) acted as control, whereas Gp II (n = 5) were treated with IV ketoconazole (2.5 mg/kg bolus then 10 mg/kg/hour for 2.5 hours). Hemodynamics, extravascular lung water (EVLW), serum levels of PGE2, and TxB2 were obtained at baseline (BL) and at 30-minute intervals for 2.5 hours (T30-T150). After 30 minutes of PAIOA the mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased significantly in both Gps (131 +/- 17 vs. 88 +/- 9 mmHg Gp 1, 119 +/- 9 vs. 79 +/- 8 mmHg Gp II, P less than 0.05); however, while MAP returned to BL values in Gp II, it remained significantly lower throughout the experimental interval in Gp I. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (MAP) was not significantly affected by PAIOA in either Gp, while pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly from BL at T120 in Gp II. Pulmonary function measured by partial pressure of arterial O2 (PaO2) and extravascular lung water (EVLW) were significantly affected by PAIOA. There was a significant decrease in PaO2 (66 +/- 6 vs. 96 +/- 8 mmHg, Gp I and 60 +/- 7 vs. 100 +/- 6 mmHg, Gp II) as well as an increase in EVLW (604 +/- 61 vs. 135 +/- 9 ml, Gp I and 641 +/- 110 vs. 117 +/- 18 ml, Gp II) in both Gps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The therapeutic action of lobenzarit disodium (CCA) on the function of endothelial cells (EC) isolated from human umbilical cord veins was investigated. CCA suppressed 3H-thymidine incorporation into EC in a dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibition was detected at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. The expression of HLA-DR antigen on the surface of EC was increased when EC were cultured with recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN gamma). Treatment of EC with either IFN gamma or interleukin-1 enhanced the adhesion of T cells to EC. The kinetics of HLA-DR antigen expression by EC cultured with IFN gamma was different from the kinetics of T cell-EC adhesion, however. Neither anti-HLA-DR nor anti-HLA-ABC monoclonal antibody inhibited T cell binding to EC monolayers. CCA suppressed the expression of HLA-DR antigen by EC cultured with rIFN gamma. In an EC monolayer adhesion assay, CCA also inhibited T cell adhesion to EC in the presence of either IFN gamma or interleukin-1. Significant inhibition was observed at a CCA concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, a level that is easily attainable in serum. These results suggest that CCA may suppress rheumatoid synovitis by reducing the angiogenesis and emigration of chronic inflammatory cells from the blood into the synovium.\r"

The antibody, designated YES8c, contained V kappa III, J kappa 2, VH1, JH4, and a D gene segment of 9 amino acids. The nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of the light chain variable region were remarkably homologous (97-98%) to previously described RF of the Wa idiotypic family (PAY, GLO, CUR, FLO, and GAR) and to that of a V kappa III germline gene (Humkv325). The YES8c heavy chain variable region gene was most closely related to the VH1 gene of the restricted human fetal repertoire, designated 51p1, and also to 3 rearranged VH1 genes that were recently isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These results suggest that variable region genes of RFs are highly conserved and that YES8c VH, as well as V kappa, may be identical to heavy and light chains expressed during early B cell development.\r"

Striatal 18F-6-fluorodopa uptake was reduced in an asymmetric pattern, caudate and putamen being involved in all cases. Uptake into medial frontal cortex was also impaired. Regional cortical oxygen metabolism was most significantly depressed in the superior and posterior temporal, inferior parietal, and occipital associated cortices.

  ".W": "The official Japanese recommendation for breast cancer screening is physical examination by a physician, in contrast to US recommendations of mammography. In this analysis of breast cancer screening, the authors used Japanese data in a cost-effectiveness model to compare the following five strategies: (1) no screening (N); (2) physical examination alone (PE); (3) mammography (MG); (4) PE followed by MG if PE findings were abnormal (PE----MG); and (5) PE combined with MG for all screened women (PE + MG). None of these programs would save medical expenditures. The total discounted net costs per patient (in US dollars) were as follows: N, +54; PE, +412; MG, +517; PE----MG, +340; and PE + MG, +731. The number of years of life saved per cohort of 100,000 asymptomatic Japanese women would range from 708 (PE----MG) to 3724 (PG + MG). The additional cost of each strategy (compared with N) per additional year of life would be +49,700 for PE, +40,400 for PE----MG, +14,300 for MG, and +18,000 for PE + MG. The least costly screening option (PE----MG) does not have the lowest cost per additional year of life saved (MG does). MG would be preferable to the current Japanese recommendation of PE alone.\r"

Patients were staged based on thoracoscopic examination and computed tomography (CT) scan: 12 patients were classified as Stage I and 10 were Stage II. A solution of gamma-interferon (40 X 106 U) was infused twice a week over 2 months. Every patient experienced fever. One patient had a Grade 2 leukopenia and one patient suffered from pleural empyema. Response evaluation was based on the following: (1) CT scan performed 2 weeks after treatment ended, and (2) repeat thoracoscopic examination with histopathologic verification in nine patients who had demonstrated a stabilization or a regression of the disease on CT scan. From the original group, 19 patients could be evaluated. Four complete thoracoscopic histopathologic responses and one partial response were observed in Stage I patients (56%). One partial response was observed in Stage II patients.\r"

  ".W": "Based on evidence available at present, it appears that heterogeneity does exist within bipolar disorder. Persons with mania differ in family history of affective illness, their age at the onset of illness, sex, and organic cause and course of the illness. The question of how these variables influence an individual's response to treatment has never been systematically studied. Multicenter trials of the various antimanic agents need to be conducted to determine whether the various subgroups of manic patients have different pharmacological response profiles. At present, the clinical management of mania is best approached using lithium carbonate in a dosage adequate to achieve a 12-hour serum lithium level to 1.0 to 1.2 mEq/L. The time to response is usually 2 to 3 weeks, and during this period an antipsychotic or benzodiazepine agent may be added to help control symptoms such as agitation or sleeplessness. Prophylactic maintenance with 12-hour serum lithium levels between 0.8 and 1.0 mEq/L should be used for at least 6 to 12 months after resolution of the manic episode. In patients with more than one episode, lithium maintenance therapy may need to be continued indefinitely. In patients who are not responsive to lithium, the most prominent alternative therapies include anticonvulsants and calcium-channel blocking agents. Anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, valproic acid, clonazepam) are generally first used as alternative therapy (either alone, or in combination with lithium), followed by a calcium-channel blocker (e.g., verapamil). Clinical practice would generally suggest first using the alternative agent alone, then adding lithium if response is inadequate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent interest has focused on two novel approaches to the treatment of Parkinson's disease-medications to slow or arrest disease progression, and cerebral transplantation. Two recent studies have demonstrated that selegiline can slow, although not halt, the progression of recent-onset Parkinson's disease. The data are sufficiently compelling to justify the use of this drug in most new patients. It also seems reasonable to extrapolate from the data and offer this medication to all patients but those with the most advanced Parkinson's disease. The current focus on excessive oxidative stress as a causative factor has led some investigators to recommended treating patients with the antioxidant tocopherol (vitamin E). There is no clinical evidence demonstrating its effectiveness, but a current multicenter study is being conducted, with the results expected within the next 2 years. High-dose vitamin E (such as 800 to 2000 U/d), taken for a number of months, is probably harmless. It is probably reasonable, therefore, to allow patients to take this over-the-counter compound until more definitive evidence is available. Another antioxidant, vitamin C, has also been advocated as a means of slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease. There are no studies that demonstrate any clinical effectiveness, and there are also no ongoing studies investigating this issue in patients with Parkinson's disease. The excitement surrounding the initially favorable results of adrenal-brain transplantation has waned with the failure of numerous institutions to replicate the original dramatic success. While mild or occasionally moderate improvement has been noted in subsequent patients undergoing adrenal-brain transplantation, the improvement has not been sufficient to justify the risk and expense of this surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91168865\r", 
  ".W": "Previous observations have shown that a portion of the acute (less than 12 h) FSH hypersecretion after ovariectomy (OVX) is LHRH independent, thereby suggesting that mechanisms governing the acute FSH hypersecretory response to OVX may reside largely within the anterior pituitary gland. Accordingly, the present studies were conducted to determine whether acute OVX-induced FSH hypersecretion can be elicited in an animal model in which the anterior pituitary gland is isolated from diencephalic chemical signals, and if so, whether the hypersecretion could be abated by the FSH-suppressing protein, follistatin. Adult female rats hypophysectomized (H) 1 week earlier received anterior pituitary grafts (H/G) (one to three glands per rat) under the kidney capsule. In order to increase ovarian secretion of negative feedback effectors substances (i.e. estrogen, inhibin), some H/G rats were injected sc with 30 IU PMSG 4-6 days after receiving pituitary transplants, whereas other rats were given the saline vehicle. Two days later (0830 h), a blood sample was obtained via an indwelling atrial catheter inserted the previous day. H/G rats given saline or PMSG then were further subdivided and either castrated or sham castrated. Additional blood samples were obtained from the catheter, and trunk blood was collected from decapitated rats 24 h after OVX for measurement of serum estradiol and PRL levels. For comparison, H rats not receiving renal pituitary transplants were subdivided into similar experimental groups as the H/G rats. Blood samples were also obtained after sham OVX or OVX of pituitary-intact, 4-day cycling rats on diestrous day 1. Ovariectomy of PMSG-treated H rats receiving either one or three pituitary allografts resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in serum FSH levels by 12 h after OVX followed by a 2- to 3-fold increase in FSH levels by 24 h relative to either the pre-OVX FSH levels measured in this group or the FSH levels measured in PMSG-treated H/G rats 24 h after sham OVX. In contrast, OVX of saline-treated H/G rats failed to elicit FSH hypersecretion. Similarly, FSH hypersecretion was not observed after OVX of saline- or PMSG-treated H rats. Whereas serum LH levels were increased 24 h after OVX of diestrous rats, no such increases were detected 24 h after OVX of any H or H/G rats. In an additional experiment, H rats receiving two pituitary allografts were treated with PMSG and subsequently castrated. Twenty-four hours later, rats were injected iv with either 60 micrograms purified porcine follistatin or saline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the present study we have investigated the effects of TRH on the levels of mRNA encoding the different forms of TR, TR beta-1, TR beta-2, and TR alpha-1 as well as that of the non-T3-binding variant, c-erbA alpha-2. GH3 cells were incubated with 100 nM TRH in the presence or absence of 1 nM T3 for 48 h, and mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. Results revealed that there is differential regulation of the individual TRs by TRH at the pretranslational level. The mRNA for the pituitary-specific form of TR, TR beta-2, was down-regulated by 60% by TRH in GH3 cells, while that of its alternative splice product, TR beta-1, was unchanged. A modest change was observed in TR alpha-1 mRNA levels, which were down-regulated by 20%; there was no change in c-erbA alpha-2 mRNA levels. Levels of nuclear T3 binding were assessed under the same conditions, and 100 nM TRH was found to decrease binding by 40% from 0.78 to 0.46 fmol/micrograms DNA. A similar change in nuclear T3 binding was seen after incubation with 1 nM T3. The effect of TRH on the GH mRNA response to T3 was investigated. In the absence of TRH there was a 4-fold induction of GH mRNA after incubation with 1 nM T3. In the presence of 100 nM TRH, no significant induction in GH mRNA by T3 was seen, indicating that T3 responsiveness as well as receptor concentration are diminished by TRH under these conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Three different experimental approaches were used to assess the regions on the beta-subunit of human FSH (hFSH beta) that may be altered or masked by its association with the alpha-subunit of hFSH (hFSH alpha) in the heterodimeric hFSH molecule. In a direct approach, we tested whether synthetic peptides corresponding to hFSH beta sequences 1-20, 16-36, 33-53, 49-67, 66-85, 81-100, and 98-111 inhibited association of hFSH alpha and hFSH beta in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Synthetic peptides-(81-100), -(98-111), and -(66-85) caused greater than 50% inhibition of subunit association, whereas other peptides showed 26% or less inhibition. These data suggested that the C-terminal sequences of hFSH beta, particularly 81-100, are at a subunit interface with hFSH alpha in heterodimeric hFSH. In another approach we reasoned that antibodies with a higher affinity for free hFSH beta than for heterodimeric hFSH bind to epitopes on hFSH beta that are masked or altered by hFSH alpha subunit. To test this hypothesis, epitopes of hFSH beta were mapped using synthetic peptides of hFSH beta sequences, three monoclonal antibodies (3G3, 4D5, and 4G8), and a polyclonal antiserum (NIDDK anti-hFSH beta). Compared to 3G3 all the other antibodies exhibited minimal reactivity with hFSH, but bound strongly to hFSH beta. The epitope-mapping data with both 4D5 and NIDDK anti-hFSH beta identified peptide 81-100, which was not recognized by 3G3. The epitope map with 4G8 identified the same three peptides as with 3G3. However, in the case of 4G8 its reactivity with peptide 33-53 was the least, whereas it was ranked first for 3G3. Since both 3G3 and 4G8 had an identical affinity for hFSH beta, it was hypothesized that sequences in peptide 33-53 may be altered or masked by hFSH alpha. To test this, we determined the specificity of anti-hFSH beta-(33-53) peptide antiserum for hFSH beta and hFSH in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antipeptide antiserum bound strongly to free hFSH beta and weakly to hFSH, suggesting that part of the sequence in peptide-(33-53) was masked or altered by association with hFSH alpha in heterodimeric hFSH. Taken together, the subunit association studies, the epitope-mapping data, and the specificity of anti-hFSH beta-(33-53) peptide antiserum have suggested that sequences in peptide-(81-100) and -(33-53) are masked or conformationally altered by hFSH alpha in heterodimeric hFSH.\r"

  ".W": "A 24-h rhythm has been demonstrated in fetal and maternal melatonin plasma concentrations in pregnant sheep in the last third of gestation. Melatonin in the maternal circulation can cross the placenta and is the major source of melatonin in the fetal circulation. Melatonin has been postulated to act as a prostaglandin (PG) synthetase inhibitor in the uterus. PG synthetase inhibitors decrease myometrial contractility. To assess transplacental passage of melatonin and potential influences of melatonin on uterine contractility, we infused melatonin continuously into the maternal jugular vein in seven pregnant sheep at 138-142 days gestation (term in our instrumented animals is 147 days gestation) at three infusion rates for successive 1-h periods during the late morning to late afternoon. There was no change in the total time during which the myometrium was active, as indicated by myometrial electromyographic activity or the myometrial contracture frequency during the 3 h before and after melatonin infusions and for each hour of the infusions. The MCR for melatonin in the ewe was 4128 +/- 410 ml/min (mean +/- SE; n = 7; weight, 50-70 kg). The resting maternal to fetal melatonin concentration ratio was 0.8; this ratio was maintained at 2.28 during melatonin infusion to the ewe at a wide range of maternal melatonin concentrations. Melatonin concentrations in the range of 3-200 times normal had no effect on the maternal plasma PGF2 alpha metabolite concentration, but caused a 40.4% fall in fetal plasma PGE2 (P less than 0.05). We conclude that changes in maternal and fetal plasma melatonin concentrations within the physiological range observed throughout the day do not alter myometrial contractility, but do alter fetal PGs.\r"

  ".W": "Although the binding, internalization, and regulation of LH, PRL, and their respective receptors have been extensively studied, it is not known whether the receptors are coordinately regulated. Using double labeling experiments, we have previously shown that receptor-bound LH and PRL can be colocalized in identical endosomes of granulosa cells. We hypothesize that high levels of PRL may induce a heterologous down-modulation of LH receptors, consequently reducing ovarian responsiveness to further gonadotropin stimulation. In this study we used a novel procedure to enrich endosomes containing internalized PRL and to determine whether unoccupied LH receptors were cointernalized in granulosa cells. Porcine granulosa cells were obtained from medium-sized (3-5 mm) follicles and cultured for 4 days in the presence of FSH. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled PRL (FITC-PRL) was used as a ligand to induce internalization of PRL receptors and as a marker to label endosomes. Granulosa cells were incubated with FITC-PRL at either 4 or 37 C for various times. At the end of the incubation, cells were trypsinized to remove surface receptors and then homogenized. The postnuclear fraction containing endosomes and other subcellular organelles was sorted using a FACStar Plus cell sorter. Results from 14 separate sorting experiments showed that 1) FITC-PRL-treated cells exhibited a sorting pattern distinct from that of FITC-BSA-treated or untreated cells; 2) excess unlabeled PRL partially shifted the sorting profile to one similar to that in controls; 3) the differences in sorting profiles were not due to free FITC; and 4) using this method, it was possible to isolate FITC-PRL-containing endosomes that were virtually devoid of other contaminating subcellular particles. Fluorescently positive (FITC-PRL-containing) organelles were collected and assayed for LH receptors using [125I]hCG as a tracer. When the cells were incubated with FITC-PRL at 37 C for 3 h, the number of available LH receptors (as determined by [125I]hCG binding) was 37% higher in particles containing FITC-PRL than in those devoid of FITC-PRL. If the cells were allowed to preincubate with FITC-PRL at 4 C for 10-16 h before raising the temperature to 37 C, the number of available LH receptors in FITC-PRL-containing endosomes was about 7-fold higher than that in FITC-negative endosomes. Results from this study suggest that PRL not only induces internalization of its own receptor, but also causes down-modulation of unoccupied LH receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The results show that TRF had dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effects on FSH-induced inhibin and progesterone production with the half-maximal inhibitory dose of 6.1-6.3 micrograms/ml. The inhibitory effect of TRF on FSH-induced inhibin and progesterone production was not reversed by removing TRF and changing medium after 48 h of treatment. TRF also inhibited insulin- and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-induced inhibin production in a dose-dependent manner. TRF did not inhibit forskolin- and 8-bromo-cAMP-induced progesterone production but did inhibit inhibin production induced by these agents. TRF had no effect on basal production of inhibin and progesterone. On the other hand, high concentrations of insulin and cortisol completely counteracted the inhibitory effect of TRF on FSH-induced progesterone production but only partially counteracted the inhibitory effect of TRF on FSH-induced inhibin production. Our data suggest that: 1) TRF may be an important negative modulator of the stimulatory actions of FSH or IGF-I and other factors acting on granulosa cells; 2) the inhibitory effects of TRF require the presence of FSH or other factors such as IGF-I or insulin, which facilitate granulosa cell differentiation; and 3) different mechanisms are involved in the modulating effects of TRF on inhibin and progesterone production.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated clearly that only a portion of all Sertoli cells secrete transferrin (TF). These findings raised the possibility that differences in the functional type of Sertoli cells from one location to another may account in part for the stage-related variation in TF release along the seminiferous tubule. In order to address this, Sertoli cells derived from tubule segments corresponding to stages III-V, VII, IX-XI, and XIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle were subjected to reverse hemolytic plaque assays to determine whether the proportion of TF cells present in those segments were similar or different. We found 21.4 +/- 1.8%, 20.3 +/- 2.0%, 48.3 +/- 2.5%, and 49.2 +/- 3.2% of all cells secreted TF in III-V, VII, IX-XI, and XIII staged segments, respectively. Results obtained from immunocytochemical staining of cells from different sections agreed well with those obtained with plaque assays, indicating that we had detected most, if not all, TF cells in these cultures. In additional experiments, we found that cultured cells from stage III-V and VII responded to FSH or isoproterenol with a large increase in the rate of TF plaque formation, whereas cells from IX-XI and XIII segments appeared to be unaffected. In contrast, bovine fibroblast growth factor caused a marked increase in the rate of TF plaque formation with IX-XI cells and only a slight increase with cells from III-V staged segments. Thus, the manner in which Sertoli cells respond to several modulatory agents appears not only to be stage-dependent, but also to be specific to the agent in question. When taken together, our observations demonstrate that cultured TF secretors obtained from different staged segments of the seminiferous tubule differ in proportion and responsiveness. These findings, when viewed in light of reports of a constant number of Sertoli cells along the seminiferous tubule, suggest that Sertoli cells may acquire and lose the ability to secrete TF or respond to modulation as the seminiferous cycle progresses.\r"

Using the Ang II receptor subtype-selective nonpeptide antagonists, DuP 753 [selective for the type 1 Ang II (AT1) receptor] and PD 123319 [selective for the type 2 Ang II (AT2) receptor], we show that follicular granulosa cells, in vivo and in vitro, exclusively express the AT2 receptor. To understand the function of Ang II in ovarian follicles, we compared the biochemical properties and transmembrane signaling pathways of the granulosa cell AT2 receptor with those properties generally associated with Ang II receptors found in the adrenal zona glomerulosa, where the AT1 receptor predominates. The mol wt of the granulosa cell AT2 receptor (approximately 79,000), estimated by affinity cross-linking studies, is similar to that of the adrenal zona glomerulosa Ang II receptor. Like the adrenal zona glomerulosa Ang II receptor, binding inhibition studies show that the granulosa cell AT2 receptor binds Ang II and Ang III with high affinity (IC50, approximately 0.5 nM for both peptides), but not Ang-(1-7) (IC50, approximately 0.5 microM) or Ang-(1-5) (IC50, greater than 10 microM). However, unlike the adrenal zona glomerulosa Ang II receptor, the granulosa cell AT2 receptor does not undergo agonist-induced endocytosis. Further, Ang II does not affect basal or stimulated inositol phosphate production, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, or adenylyl cyclase or guanylyl cyclase activity in granulosa cells. The granulosa cell AT2 receptor does not appear to directly interact with guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins, since agonist dissociation from the AT2 receptor is unaffected by the GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); in contrast, the AT1 receptor appears to directly interact with guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein, because agonist dissociation from the AT1 receptor is stimulated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). These studies clearly demonstrate that the granulosa cell AT2 receptor is functionally distinct from the well characterized adrenal zona glomerulosa Ang II receptor. The exclusive presence of the AT2 receptor on the granulosa cell makes it an ideal cell type for studying the potential, but as yet unknown, function of this receptor.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine the developmental pattern of OT secretion by bovine follicle cells as they differentiate during the follicular phase and the preovulatory follicle approaches ovulation. Holstein heifers were injected with prostaglandin F2 alpha in midluteal phase to induce luteal regression and initiate a follicular phase. The ovary bearing the preovulatory follicle was obtained by ovariectomy early in the follicular phase, in midfollicular phase, or late in the follicular phase, after the LH/FSH surge (n = 4 heifers per group). Theca interna and granulosa cells were isolated and cultured for 5 days, individually or in coculture, in defined or serum-containing medium and with or without LH (300 ng/ml) or FSH (300 ng/ml). Media were collected and replaced completely every 24 h, and OT secreted into the media was measured by RIA. Granulosa cells isolated at all three time points during the follicular phase secreted measurable amounts of OT. However, total OT secretion by granulosa cells isolated after the LH/FSH surge was 18.9-fold (defined medium) to 64.8-fold (serum-containing medium) higher than OT secretion by granulosa cells isolated early in the follicular phase, and 14.6-fold (defined medium) to 170-fold (serum-containing medium) higher than OT secretion by granulosa cells isolated in midfollicular phase. Granulosa cells isolated before the LH/FSH surge responded to the addition of LH or FSH to the culture medium with an increase in OT secretion. Cocultures of granulosa cells and theca interna isolated before the LH surge secreted more OT than cultures of granulosa cells alone. When cells were isolated early in the follicular phase the effect of coculture was more than additive, but the effect of coculture was only additive when follicles were obtained in midfollicular phase. OT secretion by granulosa cells isolated after the LH/FSH surge was not affected by gonadotropins or by coculture with theca interna. In contrast to results for granulosa cells, theca interna secreted only small and variable amounts of OT, and responses to LH were inconsistent. These findings suggest that OT detected in cultures of theca interna may be produced by small and variable numbers of granulosa cells contaminating the theca interna preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "FSH is the primary hormonal inducer of ovarian follicle maturation and a critically important regulator of steroidogenesis in granulosa cells. We examined possible molecular mechanisms subserving FSH action by assessing concentrations of cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc) mRNA in porcine granulosa cells maintained in serum-free culture. Cellular concentrations of specific P450scc mRNA were measured by Northern blot hybridization using a 32P-labeled 1-kilobase porcine cDNA clone. Specificity was tested by estimating the granulosa cell mRNA content of the constitutively expressed enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Steroidogenesis was evaluated by measuring concomitant progesterone accumulation in the culture medium. Treatment with ovine FSH (100 ng/ml) increased P450scc mRNA concentrations in a time-dependent fashion, with significant effects on both P450scc mRNA concentrations and progesterone accumulation by 4 h and a maximal increase (8- to 10-fold) at 48 h. FSH dose-response studies at 48 h revealed a significant stimulatory effect of 30 ng/ml FSH on P450scc mRNA accumulation and progesterone production, with a maximal effect at 100 ng/ml FSH. To examine the role of cAMP in mediating granulosa cell P450scc mRNA accumulation, granulosa cells were treated with forskolin, cholera toxin, 8-bromo-cAMP, 8-bromo-cGMP, 5'AMP, or cAMP analogs that differentially stimulate the two isoenzymes of protein kinase-A. Increased specific P450scc mRNA accumulation and progesterone production occurred in response to each agent except 5'AMP and 8-bromo-cGMP. No effects of these agents were observed on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. To assess possible feedback effects of steroid or sterol on FSH-stimulated P450scc mRNA concentrations, granulosa cells were treated with aminoglutethimide to block or with low density lipoprotein to stimulate steroid production. Inhibition of sterol utilization by the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme had no effect on basal or FSH-stimulated concentrations of P450scc mRNA, but markedly suppressed progesterone production. Low density lipoprotein, which increases intracellular sterol, also did not alter basal or FSH-stimulated P450scc mRNA accumulation, suggesting that neither the utilization nor the availability of sterol regulates specific P450scc mRNA levels. Estradiol alone did not increase P450scc mRNA accumulation, but did augment progesterone production. Treatment of granulosa cells with estradiol and FSH produced a synergistic increase in progesterone concentrations, but did not affect FSH-stimulated P450scc mRNA accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite interest in the in vivo control of gonadotropin release, valid assessment of the physiological regulation of the pulsatile secretion of the gonadotropin FSH has been hampered by the uncertain validity and reliability of available FSH peak detection algorithms. Difficulties in identifying FSH peaks accurately are believed to arise in part because of the slow metabolic clearance of this glycoprotein hormone. Here, we have used two complementary strategies to test the validity of FSH pulse detection. First, by means of a computer-assisted mathematical model for simulating episodic hormone secretion, we evaluated the effects of various putative FSH secretory pulse amplitudes and half-lives on the sensitivity and positive accuracy of peak detection. Secondly, we used an in vivo primate animal model, in which presumptively true FSH pulses were evaluated independently by continuous electrophysiological monitoring of mediobasal hypothalamic multiunit activity. These two approaches allowed us to define optimal pulse analysis parameters that yield maximal sensitivity and positive accuracy for detecting FSH peaks in synthetic and biological time series. We found (as predicted intuitively) that increasing half-times of hormone disappearance decrease both the sensitivity and positive accuracy of peak detection for any given peak detection thresholds and hormone secretory amplitudes. However, adequately sampled episodic FSH time series could be analyzed for FSH pulsatility by an appropriately constrained, objective computerized algorithm with reasonable (less than 10-15%) false negative and false positive errors, such that resultant sensitivity and positive accuracy exceed 85-90%. Of interest, computer simulations and the in vivo animal model exhibited similar discriminative capabilities. We conclude that increasing half-times of hormone (e.g. FSH) removal do impair hormone peak detection sensitivity and positive accuracy. Nevertheless, gonadotropin time series can be analyzed for FSH pulsatility in a valid manner with adequately constrained false negative and false positive error rates.\r"

The action of TRH on spontaneously spiking cells was to cause a brief hyperpolarization (first phase action), followed by a period during which action potential behavior was significantly modified (second phase action). The modifications during second phase action included a reduction in the slope of the up-stroke, a reduced peak potential, an increase in duration, and a depolarizing shift of the after-hyperpolarization. The modification of voltage- and calcium-dependent conductances that underlie these changes were investigated in voltage clamp experiments. During first phase action TRH was found to increase calcium-dependent potassium current. During second phase action TRH was found to significantly reduce the L-type calcium current (35%), with no alteration in the T-type calcium current. The second phase action of TRH on calcium-dependent potassium conductance was complex. First, a decrease was observed. This was followed by an increase that did not become fully manifest until after TRH was washed from the cell. TRH caused no change in voltage-dependent potassium current. These results indicate that the second phase action of TRH on action potential behavior in GH3 cells is mediated by a reduction in L-type calcium current and alterations in the behavior of calcium-dependent potassium currents, but not through changes in voltage-dependent potassium currents.\r"

  ".W": "The GnRH antagonist antide is among the most promising \"third generation\" compounds available for clinical evaluation. In primates, antide manifests prolonged (several weeks) and reversible inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion after a single high dose injection. In the present study, we have examined the effects of antide on pituitary gonadotropin secretion in vitro. Dispersed anterior pituitary cells from adult female rats were plated (48 h; 5 x 10(5) cells/well), washed, and exposed to increasing concentrations of antide for up to 48 h. Media were removed, and cells were washed twice and then incubated with GnRH (1 x 10(-8) M) plus antide for 4 h. Media and cell lysates were assayed for LH/FSH by RIA. Antide had no effect on basal LH/FSH secretion at any dose tested (10(-6)-10(-12) M). In contrast, GnRH-stimulated LH/FSH secretion was inhibited by this GnRH antagonist in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When incubated simultaneously, antide blocked GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion, with a maximal effect at 10(-6) M (ED50, 10(-7) M). Preincubation of pituitary cells with antide for 6-48 h before GnRH exposure shifted the dose-response curve to the left; the maximally effective dose was 10(-8) M; the ED50 was 10(-10) M antide after 48-h preincubation. Intracellular LH/FSH levels increased concomitant with the decrease in secreted gonadotropins. Total LH/FSH levels (secreted plus cell content) remained unchanged. The inhibition of LH secretion by antide was specific for GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion; antide had no effect on K(+)-stimulated LH secretion. Moreover, antide had little or no residual effect on LH secretion; full recovery of GnRH responsiveness in vitro occurred within 4 h after removal of antide. Lineweaver-Burke analysis of antide inhibition of GnRH-stimulated LH secretion indicated that antide is a direct competitor of GnRH at the level of the pituitary GnRH receptor. In summary, antide is a pure antagonist of GnRH stimulation of gonadotropin secretion; no agonistic actions of antide were manifest in vitro. Moreover, antide has no apparent noxious or toxic effect on pituitary cells in culture; the actions of antide are immediately reversible upon removal of antide from pituitary gonadotropes. We conclude that the long term inhibition of gonadotropin secretion by antide in vivo is not due to deleterious effects of this compound at the level of the pituitary gonadotrope.\r"

  ".W": "Previous data from this laboratory revealed a rapid and unexpectedly long inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion in ovariectomized monkeys after a single high dose injection of the GnRH antagonist antide. This extended action of antide may correlate with an extended presence of antide in the peripheral circulation. We have reported on use of a RRA for antide in serum; however, during such a prolonged presence in the body, the possibility of catabolic loss of biological activity remained to be analyzed. In the present study, we have developed an in vitro pituitary cell bioassay for antide to investigate the pharmacokinetics and possible mechanism(s) contributory to its long action. Dispersed anterior pituitary cells from adult female rats were plated (48 h; 5 x 10(5) cells/well), washed, and incubated with 0.024-6 ng antide for 24 h. Media were removed, and cells were washed twice and then incubated with GnRH (1 x 10(-8) M) plus antide standards or serum samples for 4 h. Before antide injection into long term ovariectomized monkeys, peripheral GnRH antagonist levels were undetectable. One day after a single injection (3.0 mg/kg, sc, in 50% propylene glycol-water), the level of antide was 31 +/- 13 ng/ml (n = 3). Thereafter, antide levels declined slowly and were still detectable (greater than 1.4 ng/ml) in two of three monkeys 31 days after injection. After iv administration (3.0 mg/kg; n = 2), peripheral antide levels followed a similar pharmacokinetic profile and declined slowly. Detectable antide concentrations were still present 36 days after single iv injection in both monkeys. The circulating half-lives of antide were 1.7 and 14.5 days for the first and second phases, respectively. Peripheral LH levels were suppressed to the limits of detectability within 1 day and slowly recovered to pretreatment levels within 30 +/- 5 days after sc or iv antide treatment. The ratio of bioactive antide to antide levels measured by RRA was similar throughout the study (chi = 1.24 +/- 0.09; range, 0.40-2.22), although there was a trend toward an increased B/R ratio at the end of the study. In summary, we have developed an in vitro bioassay using cultured rat pituitary cells to measure biologically active antide concentrations in peripheral circulation after sc and iv treatments. The prolonged action of antide on pituitary gonadotropin secretion in vivo is apparently due to the continued presence of biologically active antide in circulation after a single injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Since both PGs and glucocorticoids are elevated before parturition, we studied the regulation of dexamethasone (DEX; 150 nM) on PGF2 alpha synthesis and PGS expression in human placental cells in vitro. Both first trimester and term placental cells were used. DEX reduced PGF2 alpha synthesis in human term placental cells, in contrast to first trimester cells which were unaffected by the same treatment. DEX inhibition of PGF2 alpha production by term placental cells was time and dose dependent. PGS expression was analyzed by [35S]methionine metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation using polyclonal antibodies developed in rabbits against ram seminal vesicle PGS. DEX reduced PGS expression in term placental cells, but not in first trimester cells. In contrast to the effect of DEX on PGF2 alpha, progesterone and estradiol production by cells were unaffected at any stage of gestation examined. DEX inhibition of PGF2 alpha synthesis required de novo biosynthesis of RNA and proteins. These results suggest 1) corticosteroids play a role in the regulation of placental PG synthesis during parturition; 2) the inhibition of PG synthesis and PGS expression by glucocorticoids is RNA and protein biosynthesis dependent; and 3) induction of labor by glucocorticoids is not directly related to changes in placental progesterone or estradiol biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1), an important component of the immune system, has recently been shown to influence the release of several hormones in the rodent. In this paper, the effectiveness of IL-1a in modulating basal gonadotropin secretion as well as cortisol release in the primate has been investigated. Eight adult ovariectomized rhesus monkeys were given a 30-min intracerebroventricular infusion of physiological saline (n = 5), various doses of IL-1a (17 micrograms n = 5; 8.5 micrograms; n = 3; 4.2 micrograms n = 5; and 2.1 micrograms n = 4) or IL-1a plus a CRF antagonist (n = 5). LH and FSH concentrations were measured at 15-min intervals during the 3-h preinfusion baseline control and the 5-h postinfusion period, while cortisol concentrations were determined at 45-min intervals. While LH concentrations remained unchanged in the monkeys receiving saline only, they decreased significantly after the 30-min IL-1a infusion. By hour 5 after IL-1a administration, mean (+/- SE) hourly areas under the LH curves (expressed as a percentage of preinfusion baseline) were 27.7% +/- 7.3 (17 micrograms IL-1a), 31.9% +/- 8.4 (8.5 micrograms), 33.3% +/- 5.5 (4.2 micrograms), and 39% +/- 4.0 (2.1 micrograms) (P less than 0.05 vs. morning control). FSH concentrations were also significantly decreased after IL-1a, 17 micrograms: by hour 5, they were 67.4% +/- 5.0 of baseline control. While cortisol concentrations decreased thoughout the experiment in the animals receiving saline, they increased with all IL-1a doses: overall mean (+/- SE) postinfusion concentrations were 21.8 +/- 1.1 (saline), 49.5 +/- 2.2 (IL-1a, 17 micrograms), 35.1 +/- 1.9 (8.5 micrograms), 45.7 +/- 1.5 (4.2 micrograms), and 39.5 +/- 1.5 (2.1 micrograms) micrograms/dl (P less than 0.05 IL-1a vs. saline). Concomitant infusion of the CRF antagonist, [D-Phe12, NLE 21,38caMe LEU37] CRF (12-41), (120-360 micrograms), prevented the IL-1a induced LH inhibition. By hour 5, areas under LH curves were 33.5% +/- 1.7 for IL-1a alone and 99.2% +/- 4.2 (NS vs. saline) for IL-1a + CRF antagonist. The CRF antagonist also blocked the ability of IL-1a to increase cortisol secretion: mean cortisol concentrations were 28.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/dl (NS vs. saline). The results clearly indicate that the cytokine IL-1a inhibits pulsatile LH and FSH secretion in the ovariectomized rhesus monkey and demonstrate that this inhibition is causally related to the activation of CRF by this cytokine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In GH4C1 rat pituitary cells, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] enhances both the synthesis of PRL and the TRH-induced transient increase in cytosolic free calcium ( [Ca2+]i). In the present report we investigated whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 could enhance the effect of the tetradecapeptide bombesin (BBS) in GH4C1 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with 1 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 24 h enhanced the BBS-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]i compared to that in control cells, while having no significant effect on the plateau phase of [Ca2+]i. Addition of the Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine or chelating extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA did not abolish the enhancement of the BBS response in 1,25-(OH)2D3-pretreated cells. Furthermore, the BBS-induced efflux of 45Ca2+ from cells preequilibrated with 45Ca2+ was larger in cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3. Incubating GH4C1 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 alone or in combination with BBS for up to 72 h did not stimulate synthesis of PRL. However, the BBS-induced secretion of PRL was enhanced in cells pretreated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 24 h compared with that in vehicle-treated control cells. The effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on BBS-induced secretion was dose dependent, with 10(-11) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhancing the stimulated secretion of PRL. We conclude that in GH4C1 cells, pretreatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhances the BBS-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]i. This effect may be due to a modulation of the availability of sequestered intracellular Ca2+ and/or membrane Ca2+ conductance. Furthermore, pretreatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhanced secretion of PRL stimulated by BBS. The enhanced transient increase in [Ca2+]i may be the factor inducing the enhanced BBS-induced secretion of PRL.\r"

Rat adrenal glomerulosa cells metabolized exogenous [14C]arachidonic acid to products comigrating with the prostaglandins (PGs), hydroxyeicosatatraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). The metabolites were found in the cells and the incubation media; however, none of the metabolites were found esterified to cellular lipids. The major metabolites were identified as 6-keto PGF1 alpha, PGE2, PGF2 alpha, PGD2, 12(S)-HETE, 15(S)-HETE, 14,15-EET, 11,12-EET, 8,9-EET, and 5,6-EET. The identities of the HETEs and EETs were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. There was no evidence for the synthesis of leukotrienes. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, the lipoxygenase inhibitors, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, baicalein and AA861, and the combined cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitors, BW755C and eicosatetrayenoic acid, inhibited the formation of the [14C]PGs, the [14C]HETEs, and the [14C]EETs. Metyrapone and clotrimazole, inhibitors of cytochrome P450, increased the synthesis of [14C]PGs and [14C]HETEs and reduced the synthesis of [14C] EETs. Superoxide dismutase did not alter arachidonic acid metabolism. In contrast, arachidonic acid metabolism was increased in cells pretreated with catalase. These data indicate that adrenal glomerulosa cells metabolize exogenous arachidonic acid to a number of oxygenated metabolites including PGs, HETEs, and EETs. From studies with inhibitors, the EETs appear to be synthesized by a cytochrome P450 epoxygenase and the HETEs by lipoxygenases.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-seven patients with structural brain lesions on neuroimaging studies and partial epilepsy intractable to medical therapy were studied. Prolonged noninvasive interictal and ictal EEG recording was performed, followed by more focused mapping using chronically implanted subdural electrode plates. Surgical procedures included lesion biopsy, maximal lesion excision, and/or resection of zones of epileptogenesis depending on accessibility and involvement of speech or other functional areas. The epileptogenic zone involved exclusively the region adjacent to the structural lesion in 11 patients. It extended beyond the lesion in 18 patients. Eighteen other patients had remote noncontiguous zones of epileptogenesis. Postoperative control of epilepsy was accomplished in 17 of 18 patients (94%) with complete lesion excision regardless of extent of seizure focus excision. Postoperative control of epilepsy was accomplished in 5 of 6 patients (83%) with incomplete lesion excision but complete seizure focus excision and in 12 of 23 patients (52%) with incomplete lesion excision and incomplete focus excision. The extent of lesion resection was strongly associated with surgical outcome either in itself (p less than 0.003), or in combination with focus excision. Focus resection was marginally associated with surgical outcome as a dichotomous variable (p = 0.048) and showed a trend toward significance (p = 0.07) only as a three-level outcome variable. We conclude that structural lesions are associated with zones of epileptogenesis in neighboring and remote areas of the brain. Maximum resection of the lesion offers the best chance at controlling intractable epilepsy; however, seizure control is achieved in many patients by carefully planned subtotal resection of lesions or foci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Allopurinol was most effective in patients with localization-related epilepsy, especially in secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Allopurinol was not as effective in patients with Lennox syndrome or West syndrome, or in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants. When allopurinol was administered greater than 1 year, its initial effectiveness continued in 8 of 14 patients who exhibited initial improvement. In 2 of the remaining 6 patients, the initial improvement disappeared during the course of treatment but control was regained by increasing the dosage of allopurinol. Mild side effects were observed in 4 patients (13%): drowsiness in 3 and abdominal pain in 1. Allopurinol may be a useful antiepileptic drug (AED), and a double-blind placebo-controlled trial should be performed.\r"

We measured the various components of the renin-angiotensin system and the plasma levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF) during room air and hypoxic gas-mixture breathing before and after administration of metoclopramide, a competitive antagonist of dopamine. Seven resting volunteers were studied 1 wk apart under room air and hypoxic conditions (inspired O2 fraction 0.12). During hypoxemia, the release of aldosterone induced by metoclopramide was significantly smaller. This change was associated with a slight increase in iANF and with a decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels, without any change in immunoreactive blood angiotensin I concentrations. Plasma electrolytes and blood acid-base status did not show relevant changes, nor did blood pressure and heart rate. We conclude that the decreased aldosterone concentrations seen under hypoxemia are related to decreased angiotensin II levels. Other influences, such as elevated ANF, may also mediate this effect.\r"

To characterize pulmonary CA activity in situ, CO2 excretion and capillary pH equilibration were examined in isolated saline-perfused rat lungs. Isolated lungs were perfused at 25, 30, and 37 degrees C with solutions containing various concentrations of HCO3- and a CA inhibitor, acetazolamide (ACTZ). Total CO2 excretion was partitioned into those fractions attributable to dissolved CO2, uncatalyzed HCO3- dehydration, and catalyzed HCO3- dehydration. Approximately 60% of the total CO2 excretion at each temperature was attributable to CA-catalyzed HCO3- dehydration. Inhibition of pulmonary CA diminished CO2 excretion and produced significant postcapillary perfusate pH disequilibria, the magnitude and time course of which were dependent on temperature and the extent of CA inhibition. The half time for pH equilibration increased from approximately 5 s at 37 degrees C to 14 s at 25 degrees C. For the HCO3- dehydration reaction, pulmonary CA in situ displayed an apparent inhibition constant for ACTZ of 0.9-2.2 microM, a Michaelis-Menten constant of 90 mM, a maximal reaction velocity of 9 mM/s, and an apparent activation energy of 3.0 kcal/mol.\r"

Under anesthesia and before HND, airway occlusion after a 3-liter lung inflation lengthened the subsequent occluded breath by nearly 10 times the control breath duration. Between 2 wk and 3-4 yr after HND, this maneuver increased the duration of the occluded breath by only 2.5 times the control breath duration. Also under anesthesia, the airway was occluded at end expiration. This maneuver increased the duration of the subsequent inspiratory effort by 71% in hilar nerve intact ponies but by only 20-25% 2-4 wk and 3-4 yr after HND. For both tests, the pre- and post-HND differences were statistically significant (P less than 0.05), but there were no significant differences (P greater than 0.10) between 2-4 wk and 3-4 yr post-HND. In awake ponies, at rest and during mild and moderate treadmill exercise, breathing frequency was generally lower and inspiratory time was greater after relative to before HND. The inspiratory time-to-total cycle duration ratio was consistently increased by 0.10-0.15 after HND (P less than 0.05). There was no significant change in this ratio between 2-4 wk and 3-4 yr post-HND (P greater than 0.10). We conclude that the surgical procedure for HND used in this study does not permit any significant reinnervation, and there are no significant changes within the ventilatory control system to compensate for loss of hilar nerve afferents.\r"

Transmural (tm) mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa)/cardiac index (Q) plots with transmural left atrial pressure (Pla) kept constant were constructed in seven dogs, and Ppa(tm)/PEEP plots with Q and Pla(tm) kept constant were constructed in seven other dogs. Q was manipulated by using a femoral arteriovenous bypass and a balloon catheter inserted in the inferior vena cava. Pla was manipulated using a balloon catheter placed by thoracotomy in the left atrium. Ppa(tm)/Q plots were essentially linear. Before OA, the linearly extrapolated pressure intercept of the Ppa(tm)/Q relationship approximated Pla(tm). OA (0.09 ml/kg into the right atrium) produced a parallel shift of the Ppa(tm)/Q relationship to higher pressures; i.e., the extrapolated pressure intercept increased while the slope was not modified. After OA, 4 Torr PEEP (5.4 cmH2O) had no effect on the Ppa(tm)/Q relationship and 10 Torr PEEP (13.6 cmH2O) produced a slight, not significant, upward shift of this relationship. Changing PEEP from 0 to 12 Torr (16.3 cmH2O) at constant Q before OA led to an almost linear increase of Ppa(tm) from 14 +/- 1 to 19 +/- 1 mmHg. After OA, Ppa(tm) increased at 0 Torr PEEP but changing PEEP from 0 to 12 Torr did not significantly affect Ppa(tm), which increased from 19 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 1 mmHg. These data suggest that moderate levels of PEEP minimally aggravate the pulmonary hypertension secondary to OA lung injury.\r"

SOM administration (0.6-1.8 nmol) into the nucleus paragigantocellularis and the nucleus reticularis lateralis of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata induced ventilatory depression and apnea. The occurrence of apnea was dose dependent and attributed to the anesthetic depth, and it was seen within 60-240 s after injection. In anesthetized rats the apnea was seen as a termination or a continuous decrease in tidal volume while respiratory frequency remained unaltered. SOM-induced apnea was caused by depression of central inspiratory drive. SOM injections into the dorsal medulla were ineffective in eliciting apnea, although a ventilatory depression but no apnea was induced in the awake unanesthetized state. In addition to its effect on basal ventilation, SOM administration in the ventrolateral medulla resulted in a blunted ventilatory response to hypoxic and hypercapnic stimuli in anesthetized rats. We conclude that SOM has potent inhibitory effects on respiration that are specifically located in the nucleus paragigantocellularis and the nucleus reticularis lateralis.\r"

Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated by multipoint pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa)/cardiac output (Q) plots before and 60 min after sufficient amounts of 100-microns (n = 6 dogs) or 1,000-microns (n = 6 dogs) glass beads to triple baseline Ppa were given and again 20 min after 5 mg/kg hydralazine in all the animals. Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique in each of these experimental conditions. Embolization increased both the extrapolated pressure intercepts (by 6 mmHg) and the slopes (by 5 mmHg.l-1.min.m2) of the linear Ppa/Q plots, together with an 80% angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction. These changes were not significantly different in the two subgroups of dogs. However, arterial PO2 was most decreased after the 100-microns beads, and arterial PCO2 was most increased after the 1,000-microns beads. Both bead sizes deteriorated the distribution of ventilation (VA)/perfusion (Q) ratios, with development of lung units with higher as well as with lower than normal VA/Q. Only 100-microns beads generated a shunt. Only 1,000-microns beads generated a high VA/Q mode and increased inert gas dead space. Hydralazine increased the shunt and decreased the slope of the Ppa/Q plots after 100-microns beads and had no effect after 1,000-microns beads. We conclude that in embolic pulmonary hypertension, Ppa/Q characteristics are unaffected by embolus size up to 1,000 microns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most reports have however, been casuistic or uncontrolled. In a randomized double blind placebo-controlled cross-over study we therefore examined the effect of 14-day GH administration (12 IU sc at 2000 h) on plasma volume, extracellular volume (ECV), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), arginine vasopressin, and the renin angiotensin system in eight healthy adult men. A significant GH induced increase in serum insulin growth factor I was observed. GH caused a significant increase in ECV (L): 20.45 +/- 0.45 (GH), 19.53 +/- 0.48 (placebo) (P less than 0.01), whereas plasma volume (L) remained unchanged 3.92 +/- 0.16 (GH), 4.02 +/- 0.13 (placebo). A significant decrease in plasma ANP (pmol/L) after GH administration was observed: 2.28 +/- 0.54 (GH), 3.16 +/- 0.53 (placebo) P less than 0.01. Plasma aldosterone (pmol/L): 129 +/- 14 (GH), 89 +/- 17 (placebo), P = 0.08, and plasma angiotensin II (pmol/L) levels: 18 +/- 12 (GH), 14 +/- 7 (placebo), P = 0.21, were not significantly elevated. No changes in plasma arginine vasopressin occurred (1.86 +/- 0.05 pmol/L vs. 1.90 +/- 0.05, P = 0.33). Serum sodium and blood pressure remained unaffected. Moderate complaints, which could be ascribed to water retention, were recorded in four subjects [periorbital edema (n = 3), acral paraesthesia (n = 2) and light articular pain (n = 1)]. The symptoms were most pronounced after 2-3 days of treatment and diminished at the end of the period. In summary, 14 days of high dose GH administration caused a significant increase in ECV and a significant suppression of ANP.\r"

The role of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) in this dysautonomia was studied by cholate extraction of Gs from erythrocytes from 11 normal subjects and 14 symptomatic dysautonomic patients and reconstitution into cyc-S49 lymphoma membranes, which have normal receptor and adenylyl cyclase but lack Gs. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the dysautonomia group was increased compared to that in controls [3.66 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SE; n = 14) vs. 2.87 +/- 0.14 (n = 11) U cyc- reconstituted activity/mg erythrocyte protein; P less than 0.05]. beta-Adrenergic receptor high affinity state formation was greatest in the severely symptomatic group [KL/KH: severe symptoms, 130 +/- 48 (n = 6); mild symptoms, 33 +/- 7 (n = 7); control, 27 +/- 6 (n = 11); severe dysautonomia distinct, P less than 0.017]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylated G-proteins yielded no gross distinction between severely symptomatic and control groups. This subset of hyperadrenergic dysautonomia patients, thus, has supercoupled beta 2-adrenergic receptors (increase in both agonist binding and cyclase activation) conferred by an abnormal Gs, whose effects on agonist binding reflect the severity of illness.\r"

Stimulation of B cells to enter S phase of the cell cycle by treatment with the combination of phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore also stimulated nuclear TRE-binding activity within 2 h, with maximal expression at 4 h; however, phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were not as effective in stimulating binding activity when examined separately. Stimulated nuclear expression of TRE-binding activity appears to require protein synthesis. Fos- and Jun/AP-1-related proteins participate directly in the identified nucleoprotein complex, as shown by the ability of c-fos- and c-jun-specific antisera to either alter or completely abolish electrophoretic migration of the complex in native gels. Further, UV photo-cross-linking studies identified two major TRE-binding protein species, whose sizes correspond to TRE-binding proteins derived from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The results suggest that in primary B cells nuclear TRE-binding activity represents a \"downstream\" signaling event that occurs subsequent to changes in protein kinase C activity and intracellular Ca2+ but that can be triggered \"physiologically\" through sIg.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the nuclear protein, Ets-1, which is preferentially expressed in lymphocytes, binds to the long terminal repeat of Moloney murine sarcoma virus and HTLV-1 and regulates gene expression. The association of Ets-1 with DNA has been shown to be lost when the protein is phosphorylated. Thus, Ets-1 may regulate gene expression in lymphocytes and this activity may be determined by its phosphorylation state. To address the possibility that Ets-1 activity may be altered by membrane (m) Ig-mediated signal transduction, we analyzed the effect of mIgM and mIgD ligation on the phosphorylation state of Ets-1. Monoclonal anti-IgM or anti-IgD antibody stimulation of normal mouse B cells led to increased phosphorylation of Ets-1 within 2 min. This response was absolutely dependent on calcium mobilization and could be induced by elevation of intracellular free calcium using the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Calcium release from intracellular stores was sufficient to mediate the phosphorylation of Ets-1. Treatment of resting B cells with IL-4, TGF beta-1, IFN-gamma, anti-class I, or anti-class II antibodies did not induce Ets-1 phosphorylation. In summary, calcium mobilization from intracellular stores after mIgM or mIgD ligation provides a necessary and sufficient signal for activation of Ets-1 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation event may act in the alteration of gene expression during B cell activation.\r"

Striking increases in intracellular calcium were observed in cortical thymocytes from transgenic mice containing productively rearranged alpha and beta TCR genes, when CD3 or TCR was cross-linked with CD4 or CD8 using heteroconjugated mAb. However, in mature T cells derived from lymph nodes of these mice, identical stimuli elicited calcium responses that were significantly smaller in magnitude. A thymocyte cell line that expresses a low level of the transgenic TCR and has a phenotype characteristic of cortical thymocytes (CD4+CD8+J11d+Thy-1+) was established from a female alpha beta TCR transgenic mouse. Cross-linking of CD4 or CD8 molecules to CD3/TCR induced strong calcium responses in these cells. Responses were weak or absent when CD3 or TCR were aggregated alone. Heteroconjugates of Thy-1xCD3 did not increase the intracellular calcium concentration in transgenic thymocytes or in the thymocyte cell line, although Thy-1 is highly expressed on immature cells. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation was observed when CD3 or TCR was cross-linked with CD4 or CD8 on transgenic thymocytes or on the thymocyte cell line, in comparison with aggregation of CD3/TCR alone. Taken together, these data show that CD4 and CD8 molecules allow the weakly expressed CD3/TCR of cortical thymocytes to transduce strong intracellular signals upon receptor ligation. These signals may be involved in selection processes at the CD4+CD8+ stage of differentiation.\r"

We investigated whether peripheral blood eosinophilia, which is a characteristic feature of both allergic and nonallergic asthma, correlates with T cell activation and lymphokine production in asthmatic patients. Flow cytometric analysis of T cell activation markers revealed that asthmatic individuals are characterized by increased numbers of IL-2R (CD25)-bearing T cell subsets. The absolute number of IL-2R+ T cells correlated with the eosinophilia observed in the asthmatic patients. Purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from allergic and nonallergic asthmatic individuals spontaneously secreted factors that extend the lifespan of eosinophils in vitro. T cells from normal donors displayed this effect only after polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. The eosinophil lifespan-extending factors were also found in sera of asthmatic patients. Identification of these factors was performed by using neutralizing antibodies against IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF. In sera, mainly IL-5 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF were responsible for prolonged eosinophil survival, whereas granulocyte-macrophage CSF was dominant in T cell supernatants. These results indicate that T cells and secretion of lymphokines play an important regulatory function toward eosinophils, which are thought to represent major proinflammatory effector cells in certain types of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "IgE induction from human cells has generally been considered to be T cell dependent and to require at least two signals: IL-4 stimulation and T cell/B cell interaction. In the present study we report a human system of T cell-independent IgE production from highly purified B cells. When human cells were co-stimulated with a mAb directed against CD40 (mAb G28-5), there was induction of IgE secretion from purified blood and tonsil B cells as well as unfractionated lymphocytes. Anti-CD40 alone failed to induce IgE from blood mononuclear cells or purified B cells. The effect of the combination of anti-CD40 and IL-4 on IgE production was very IgE isotype specific as IgG, IgM, and IgA were not increased. Furthermore, anti-CD40 with IL-5 or PWM did not co-stimulate IgG, IgM, or IgA and in fact strongly inhibited PWM-stimulated IgG, IgM and IgA production from blood or tonsil cells. IgE synthesis induced by anti-CD40 plus IL-4 was IFN-gamma independent as is the in vivo production of IgE in humans; the doses of IFN-gamma that profoundly suppressed IgG synthesis induced by IL-4, or IL-4 plus IL-6, had no inhibitory effect on anti-CD40-induced IgE production. Anti-CD23 and anti-IL-6 also could not block anti-CD40 plus IL-4-induced IgE production, but anti-IL-4 totally blocked their effect. IgE production via CD40 was not due to IL-5, IL-6 or nerve growth factor as none of these synergized with IL-4 to induce IgE synthesis by purified B cells. Finally, we observed that CD40 stimulation alone could enhance IgE production from in vivo-driven IgE-producing cells from patients with very high IgE levels; cells that did not increase IgE production in response to IL-4. Taken together, our data suggest that the signals delivered for IgE production by IL-4 and CD40 stimulation may mimic the pathway for IgE production seen in vivo in human allergic disease.\r"

TGF-beta by itself did not affect the viability of either the intracellular or extracellular target in concentrations up to 200 ng/ml. As little as 1 ng/ml TGF-beta, however, suppressed more than 70% of the intracellular killing activity of macrophages treated with lymphokines. In contrast, more than 100 ng/ml TGF-beta was required to suppress intracellular killing by cells activated with an equivalent amount of recombinant IFN-gamma. Addition of TGF-beta for up to 30 min after exposure to activation factors significantly reduced macrophage killing of intracellular parasites. Pretreatment of macrophages with TGF-beta was even more effective: treatment of cells with TGF-beta for 4 h before addition of activation factors abolished all macrophage intracellular killing activity. Regardless of treatment sequence, however, TGF-beta had absolutely no effect, at any concentration tested, on activated macrophage resistance to infection induced by lymphokines or by the cooperative interaction of IFN-gamma and IL-4. Effects of TGF-beta on tumoricidal activity of activated macrophages was intermediate to that of its effects on intracellular killing or resistance to infection. Lymphokine-induced tumor cytotoxicity was marginally (25%) affected by TGF-beta; 200 ng/ml was able to suppress IFN-gamma-induced tumoricidal activity by 40%. Thus, TGF-beta dramatically suppressed certain activated macrophage cytotoxic effector reactions, but was only partially or not at all effective against others, even when the same activation agent (IFN-gamma) was used. The biochemical target for TGF-beta suppressive activity in these reactions may be the pathway for nitric oxide production from L-arginine, because TGF-beta also inhibited the generation of nitric oxide by cytokine-activated macrophages.\r"

The net result was a ninefold increase in newly synthesized cell-associated H-2Dd. The results were consistent with determination of the kinetics of increased expression of H-2Dd determined by immunofluorescence and suggest that an early effect of IFN-gamma on the expression of class I Ag is a retardation of catabolism leading to an increase of newly synthesized class I Ag.\r"

To determine whether secretory component (SC), the receptor for transporting polymeric IgA from tissues to mucosal surfaces, was also influenced by Ag, ovariectomized rats were immunized and boosted by placing SRBC into the lumena of individual uterine horns. In response to Ag, the levels of polymeric IgA, as well as free SC and SC bound to polymeric IgA, increased in uterine secretions. When ovariectomized animals were treated with estradiol, a fivefold increase in SC levels was observed in the immunized horns, indicating that a hormone response is superimposed on the Ag-induced stimulation of uterine SC. To determine whether IFN-gamma influences the presence of SC in uterine secretions, IFN-gamma was placed in the uterine lumena of ovariectomized nonimmunized rats. When uterine secretions were analyzed, significantly higher levels of SC were found in IFN-gamma-exposed uteri than were present in saline treated control animals. In contrast, intrauterine instillation of IFN-gamma had no effect on the levels of IgA in uterine secretions. This response was specific for IFN-gamma in that IFN-alpha/beta had no effect on uterine SC or IgA levels. These results indicate that intrauterine instillation of Ag, in addition to evoking pronounced antibody responses, stimulates the production of SC, which may be responsible for the transport of polymeric IgA from tissue to uterine secretions. Furthermore, they indicate that IFN-gamma placed in the uterine lumen stimulates SC production and suggest that the uterine SC response to Ag may be mediated by the action of IFN-gamma on uterine epithelial cells.\r"

We have now examined some of the early activation events triggered by PAF binding to three Ig-secreting B cell lines, LA350 (IgM secreting), HSCE- (IgG secreting), and U266 (IgE secreting). After addition of 10(-7) to 10(-11) M PAF, but not equimolar concentrations of the inactive metabolite lyso-PAF, all three cell lines demonstrated rapid dose-dependent increases in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i). The increases in [Ca2+]i resulted from both the release of Ca2+ from internal stores as well as transmembrane Ca2+ uptake. Addition of PAF triggered the rapid hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and accumulation of inositol phosphates. PAF also increased expression of the cell cycle-active genes c-fos and EGR2 in a dose-dependent fashion. The stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis and the increases in gene expression were all inhibited by the specific PAF receptor antagonist Web 2086. The LA350 cell line (which expresses surface IgM) was also shown to increase [Ca2+]i after addition of anti-IgM antibodies. Sequential addition of PAF or anti-IgM antibody in either order failed to reveal any evidence for heterologous desensitization. Furthermore, the PAF receptor antagonist did not affect anti-IgM induced changes in [Ca2+]i. These data provide evidence for the presence of functional PAF receptors on B lymphoblastoid cells and indicate a potential role for PAF in the regulation of B cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Acute murine schistosomiasis mansoni is characterized by a vigorous CD4+ delayed-type hypersensitivity T cell-mediated granulomatous immune response to deposited parasite eggs. During the chronic stage of infection the granulomatous response is spontaneously down-modulated by Ag-specific Ts cells and their soluble factors. Recently, we established an in vitro model system whereby soluble egg Ag (SEA)-induced acute and chronic infection-derived Ts cells suppressed the proliferation and IL-2 production of acute infection effector delayed-type hypersensitivity T cells. In the present study, culture supernatants harvested from the induced Ts cell cultures were found to suppress, in a non-cytotoxic manner, the SEA-mediated proliferation and IL-2, but not IL-4 production of acute infection CD4+ splenic T cells. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the factor-mediated suppression of IL-2 in the acute infection cells occurred at the transcriptional level as IL-2 mRNA was suppressed within 10 h of SEA stimulation. The acute (A-TseF) and chronic (C-TseF) infection-derived effector suppressor factors were found to be Ag-specific both in production and elicitation of function, and acted without MHC restriction. Moreover, the A-TseF and C-TseF molecules bear binding sites for SEA and an A-TseF was also shown to bind anti-SEA antibodies. Positive selection by flow cytometry showed that the TseF molecules are produced by Ag-stimulated CD4+ acute or chronic infection splenic cells and that CD4+ cells are the target of the suppression.\r"

  ".U": "91170737\r", 
  ".W": "The murine immune response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection involves the activation of CD8+, class I MHC-restricted and virus-specific CTL. At times coinciding with CTL activation, high levels of IL-2 gene expression and production occur, the IL-2R is expressed, and T cell blastogenesis and proliferation are induced. We have previously found that, although both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets transcribe IL-2, the CD4+ subset appears to be the major producer of IL-2 whereas the CD8+ subset appears to be the major proliferating population when the subsets are separated after activation in vivo. The studies presented here were undertaken to examine the contribution made by the CD4+ subset to lymphocyte proliferation in vivo. Responses to LCMV infection were examined in intact mice and in mice depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ subsets by antibody treatments in vivo. Protocols were such that in vivo treatments with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 depleted the respective subset by greater than 90%. In situ hybridizations demonstrated that the IL-2 gene was expressed in non-B lymphocytes isolated from either CD4+ cell-depleted or CD8+ cell-depleted mice on day 7 post-infection with LCMV. When placed in culture, however, cells from CD8+ cell-depleted mice produced significantly higher levels of detectable IL-2 than did cells isolated from CD4+ cell-depleted mice on day 7 post-infection. IL-2 was apparently produced in vivo in mice depleted of either CD4+ or CD8+ cells, as expression of the gene for the p55 chain of the IL-2R, IL-2 responsiveness, and lymphocyte proliferation were observed with cells isolated from both sets of mice. Lymphocyte proliferation was shown to be sustained in mice depleted of CD4+ cells in vivo by three criteria: 1) non-B lymphocytes isolated from infected mice depleted of CD4+ cells underwent more DNA synthesis than did those isolated from uninfected mice or from infected mice depleted of CD8+ cells; 2) leukocyte yields were expanded during infection of CD4+ cell-depleted mice; and 3) CD8+ cell numbers were increased during infection of CD4+ cell-depleted mice. The majority of non-B lymphocytes having the characteristics of blast lymphocytes was recovered in the CD8+ populations isolated from infected CD4+ cell-depleted mice. These findings suggest that the requirement for the CD4+ subset to sustain CD8+ lymphocyte proliferation in vivo is limited, and that CD4+ and CD8+ cell types can function independently in many aspects of their responses to viral infections.\r"

  ".W": "CTL-mediated selection for loss of expression of Mta by H-2-heterozygous SV40-transformed mouse fibroblasts (line 24SV) produced an unusual phenotypic class of maternally transmitted Ag negative mutants defective in both MHC expression and in anti-viral activity. Severely reduced surface expression of class I MHC Ag from multiple loci of both haplotypes correlated with low levels of MHC H chain and beta 2-microglobulin mRNA. Inasmuch as IFN can up-regulate class I expression and some fibroblasts elaborate autocrine IFN-beta, we examined whether IFN could restore wild-type expression of class I MHC Ag. However, IFN could not restore wild-type expression. Moreover, the fold-increases in class I Ag and mRNA expression were significantly reduced in mutant cells compared to wild-type cells. These results suggested that the mutants might have generalized defects in IFN response. Inasmuch as the induction of an anti-viral state is a hallmark of IFN responses, we exposed cells to IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma and challenged with virus. 24SV cells, exposed to any of the three IFNs, were completely protected from destruction by vesicular stomatitis, mengovirus or respiratory syncytial viruses. In contrast, MHC and anti-viral defective mutants could not be protected from virus-induced lysis by any IFN. Somatic cell hybridization analyses indicated that both basal MHC and IFN-inducible phenotypes were recessive to wild-type, and that a trans-acting regulatory factor required for basal MHC expression is defectively expressed in the mutants. Such a factor may integrate the organismal response to virus infection, encompassing both immune and nonimmune anti-viral responses.\r"

  ".W": "Among the schistosome proteins characterized as vaccine candidates, an Ag of 28 kDa (Sm-28-GST) has received considerable attention. It was shown to be antigenic in humans and protective in mice, rats, hamsters, and baboons. Synthetic peptides derived from its sequence have been used to characterize the immune response to the molecule and one of these, comprising aminoacids 115-131 has been shown to incorporate both T and B cell recognition sites in a variety of experimental models. An octameric (\"octopus\") construction of the 115-131 peptide has been synthesized and its antigenicity and immunogenicity have been examined. The octopus construct is immunogenic in rats, mice and baboons in the presence of CFA (for rodents) and Bacille-Calmette-Guerin vaccine (for primates) as adjuvants. This clearly indicates that the construction allowed the conservation of the immune sites of the cognate protein. Moreover, anti-octopus sera from immunized Fischer rats were able to mediate platelet-, macrophage-, and eosinophil-dependent cytotoxicity toward schistosomula. Rats immunized with the 115-131 octopus were partially protected against a challenge infection with Schistosoma mansoni cercariae and this was paralleled by an increased level of IgG and more importantly, of IgE Sm-28-GST-specific antibodies.\r"

A prominent feature of the fetal repertoire is the lack of nucleotide region additions and shorter germline-derived D segments compared with the adult repertoires. Also of interest were distinct differences in D family and JH usage in the three libraries representing different stages of ontogeny. The absence of DFL16.2 in the fetal sequences analyzed was of particular note. Also of note was a substantial underutilization of the largest D family, DSP2, in the aged repertoire. The study provides further evidence that the Ig repertoire is developmentally regulated. In addition, the results indicate that several aspects of the recombination process are different in adult and fetal B lineage cells, suggesting that B cells present early in ontogeny are distinct from those present in the adult.\r"

They recognize different facets of the Z-DNA structure. They both use VH10 family genes and share 95% sequence base sequence identity in the VH and leader sequences; however, they differ in the 5'-untranslated region of the VH mRNA, indicating they arise from different germline genes. Both use JH4 segments. They differ from each other very extensively in the CDR3 of both H and L chains. The most closely related H chains in the current GenBank/EMBL data base are two mouse IgG anti-DNA autoantibodies, one from an MRL-lpr/lpr mouse (MRL-DNA4) and one from an NZB/NZW mouse (BV04-01). Z22 and Z44 share 95% sequence identity with these antibodies in the VH segment. In addition, Z22 is identical to MRL-DNA4 at 91% of the positions in the 5'-untranslated region of the H chain mRNA. The two antibodies share 95% base sequence identity in the V kappa segment. The most closely related L chains, with 97 to 98% sequence identity, are the V kappa 10b germline gene for Z22 and the V kappa 10a germ line gene, which is associated with A/J anti-arsonate antibodies and BALB/c anti-ABO blood group substance antibodies, for Z44. Z22 and Z44 share several structural features (similarities in VH, JH, and V kappa) but differ very markedly in the L chain CDR1 and both H and L chain CDR3 sequences; these regions may determine the differences in their specific interactions with Z-DNA.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported the sequences of putative latent a1 cDNA derived from an alpha 2 alpha 2 rabbit. Significant similarity to nominal a1 cDNA sequences was noted, but none of the latent sequences were completely a1-like. We have now probed a genomic library, produced from the same alpha 2 alpha 2 rabbit, for evidence of germline latent a1 VH genes. Four hundred ninety-four VH+ clones were screened with oligonucleotides specific for a1 diagnostic regions of framework region 1 (FR1) and FR3. Twenty-two percent of the VH+ clones hybridized with an a1FR3 oligonucleotide probe. Two a1 FR1 probes yielded weak signals with 6% to 13% of the VH+ clones. Twenty VH genes from clones positive for one or more of the a1-specific oligonucleotide probes were sequenced, revealing 14 unique germline VH genes. All but one of these genes were 85% to 92% identical to the VH1-a1 nominal gene prototype, with sequence identity extending into the leader intron. Most genes displayed extended regions of similarity to a1 in FR1, FR3, or both and expressed 13 to 17 of the 21 allotype-associated residues, consistent with the nominal a1 sequence. The a1-like sequences were variously interspersed with short non-a1 segments, suggestive of germline gene conversion. Although none of the germline a1-like VH genes we have isolated from the alpha 2 alpha 2 rabbits are identical to the known a1 genes or protein sequences from alpha 1 alpha 1 rabbits and 8 of 14 are pseudogenes, most could make significant contributions to the synthesis of a complete nominal a1 sequence by serving as a pool of sequence donors during somatic gene conversion.\r"

Such long term cultured cells express anti-tumor activity in vitro, mediate the regression of established tumor in murine models of cancer, and have been used for the treatment of cancer in humans. We have characterized freshly isolated mouse Thy-1+ TIL populations, as well as long term TIL cultures, from several different C57BL/6 (B6) tumors. Freshly isolated Thy-1+ TIL include both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, as well as cells bearing NK markers. These cells are predominantly TCR alpha beta+, with a smaller population of TCR gamma delta+ cells. The TCR alpha beta+ cells expressed a broad distribution of V beta phenotypes that was statistically different from that expressed in normal B6 splenic Thy-1+ cells or CD8+ cells, presumably reflecting in vivo selection in the host anti-tumor response. NK cells are present in these tumors at a greater frequency than noted in splenic T cells. Cultured TIL populations rapidly became exclusively Thy-1+/CD8+/CD4- and TCR alpha beta+/gamma delta-. Individual long term TIL populations initially expressed multiple V beta products, but rapidly restricted their V beta expression, frequently expressing a single dominant V beta. The identity of this dominant V beta varied among different TIL lines, but the overall representation of V beta phenotypes in these cultures was statistically different from that seen in Thy-1+ or CD8+ splenocytes. No statistical difference was noted between lines derived from antigenically distinct tumors. The selection of tumor specific T cells in vitro is therefore not reflected in any simple predominance of V beta usage. The complexity of TCR usage in the anti-tumor response may result from the involvement of multiple alpha- and beta-chain regions in the response to a single antigenic determinant, or may reflect multiple antigenic determinants expressed on a single syngeneic tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Four human ovarian and breast tumor lines expressing the HER2/neu oncogene were resistant to the cytotoxic and DNA-degradative activity of TNF. The resistance was not associated with altered TNF receptor function because Scatchard analysis of 125I-rTNF binding to HER2/neu-expressing target cells revealed receptors with normal binding parameters. Furthermore, the TNF receptors on the resistant lines were capable of signal transduction as evidence by the induction of ADP-ribose polymerase activity and MHC expression. TNF resistance was not reversed by coincubation with drugs that interrupted the glutathione redox cycle. In addition, although coincubation of HER2/neu-expressing targets with cycloheximide resulted in significant TNF-induced lysis, when compared to HER2/neu-nonexpressing targets similarly treated with cycloheximide, a significant relative resistance was still present. To investigate the role of ADP-ribosylation in the resistance of these targets, we used nontoxic concentrations of two inhibitors of ADP-ribose polymerase, 3-aminobenzamide, and nicotinamide. Both inhibitors completely reversed the resistance of HER2/neu-expressing targets to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity and DNA injury in a concentration-dependent fashion. These inhibitors of ADP-ribose polymerase did not act by down-regulating expression of HER2/neu oncogenes. In contrast, aminobenzamide and nicotinamide significantly diminished TNF-induced cytotoxicity of L929 targets. These data suggest that the activity of ADP-ribose polymerase may play a pivotal role in determining the fate of the target cell during exposure to TNF.\r"

This study was undertaken to investigate whether a similar division can be made within the CD8+ T cell population. A quantitative comparison was made of the requirements for activation and differentiation of CD8+CD45RA+ and CD8+CD45RO+ cells. Stimulation of T lymphocytes with anti-CD3 mAb immobilized at high-density induced strong proliferation and CTL activity in both CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ cells. Suboptimal TCR/CD3 triggering, in contrast, induced substantially higher levels of proliferation and CTL activity in CD8+CD45RO+ cells compared with their CD45RA+ counterparts. Lymphokine secretion (i.e., Il-2 and TNF-alpha) was under any condition more readily induced in CD8+CD45RO+ cells. Markedly, proliferation of both CD8+CD45RA+ and CD8+CD45RO+ T cells initiated by anti-CD3 mAb immobilized at high densities was not inhibited by addition of anti-CD25 mAb, in contrast to proliferation induced by suboptimal anti-CD3 mAb concentrations. These findings show that a functional division between CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T cells with distinct requirements for activation and differentiation may also be made in the CD8+ subset.\r"

The loss of either the alpha- or the beta-chain expression in the mutant cells was associated with the loss of surface TCR/CD3 complex, which could be rescued by the transfection of appropriate exogenous alpha- and/or beta-chain gene constructs. Because these cells express a single TCR molecule on the cell surface, they are useful for the study of the assembly and function of the alpha beta TCR. This strategy is also generally applicable for the generation of homozygous mutant cell lines lacking other gene products.\r"

Ti/CD3 induction of inositol phosphate production demonstrated no dependence on exogenous guanine nucleotides. Furthermore, Ti/CD3 stimulation did not influence the kinetics or dose-response of GTP[S]-induced inositol phosphate production, suggesting that the Ti/CD3 complex does not regulate guanine nucleotide exchange on the G protein pool stimulated by GTP[S]. These data indicate that the Ti/CD3 complex is not G protein-linked to PLC in a manner analogous to the G protein linkage of receptors to adenylate cyclase. However, the inhibitory guanine nucleotide, GDP, antagonizes not only GTP[S]-induced polyphosphatidylinositol hydrolysis but also UCHT1-induced inositol phosphate production. These data infer that a G protein can modulate the coupling of the Ti/CD3 complex to PLC and that there may be some \"cross-talk\" between Ti/CD3 and G protein PLC coupling mechanisms.\r"

Flow cytometric analysis of the donor- and host-derived splenic populations during the course of acute dysfunction and gradual recovery revealed a complex pattern of changes in lymphoid and myeloid populations that resulted in the repopulation of the host with donor-derived cells. Initially, donor-derived T cell populations expanded, particularly CD8+ T cells. Next, host T cell and B cell populations disappeared. Finally, donor-derived cells repopulated the lymphohematopoietic system in the sequence myeloid populations, B cells, and, after a protracted period, T cells. The recovery of immune functions following GVHR-induced immune deficiency was associated with this repopulation of the spleen by donor-derived cells. Donor repopulation of the host lymphohematopoietic system required the presence of both CD4 and CD8 cells in the original donor inoculum. Depletion of donor CD4 populations precluded development of GVHR or any donor engraftment; depletion of CD8 cells resulted in engraftment solely of donor CD4 populations.\r"

Limiting dilution experiments revealed that the frequency of clonogenic cells in fresh triple-negative thymocytes was less than 1%. Of 40 clones obtained in a representative experiment, 37 were triple negative and 3 were CD4+ TCR-alpha beta+. No TCR-gamma delta+ clones were isolated. Some of the triple-negative clones expressed CD16 and were apparently NK cells. Seven representative CD16-triple-negative clones were expanded and characterized in detail.

One of them expressed cytoplasmic CD3 delta and CD3 epsilon Ag, but these Ag were not detected in any peripheral blood-derived CD16- NK clones examined for comparison. The seven CD16- thymus-derived clones exhibited significant cytolytic activity against K562. The clone that expressed cytoplasmic CD3 Ag was shown to have the germ-line configuration of the TCR-beta and TCR-gamma genes. Thus, it is suggested that in vitro culture of triple-negative thymocytes can give rise to NK-like cells, including those that express cytoplasmic CD3 Ag. In contrast to previous reports, our results gave no evidence of differentiation of triple-negative thymocytes into TCR-alpha beta+ or TCR-gamma delta+ T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The IgA producing murine B lymphoma, CH12.LX.C4.4F10 (4F10) and the IgM producing murine lymphoma, CH12.LX.C4.5F5 (5F5) were found to express substantial numbers of substance P (SP) receptors having dissociation constants equal to 0.69 nM. Binding of SP by these B lymphoma cells was via the tachykinin-specific C-terminus sequence, Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2, because SP, SP antagonist (D-Pro2-D-Phe7-D-Trp9-SP), eledoisin, and substance K could effectively inhibit radiolabeled SP binding, whereas the SP N-terminus fragment, SP (1-4), could not. The functionality of these receptors could be demonstrated by the ability of subnanomolar concentrations of SP to induce Ig secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. However, the presence of a second stimulus in these cultures was required to obtain maximal increases. IgA secretion by 4F10 cells was elevated only 25 to 37%, and IgM secretion by 5F5 cells was not significantly increased in cultures in which nanomolar concentrations of SP were present. Conversely, coculturing 5F5 cells with a suboptimal concentration of LPS (50 ng/ml) and 10(-10)M SP resulted in an approximate threefold increase in supernatant IgM when compared to control cultures stimulated with LPS alone. While not as dramatic, 10(-10) M SP also enhanced IgA secretion of LPS-stimulated 4F10 cells by approximately 45%. This enhancement of Ig secretion was SP-specific, as evidenced by the ability of 1000-fold excess of SP antagonist to block SP-induced, but not LPS-induced, Ig production. Clearly, SP could act synergistically with LPS to enhance Ig secretion; therefore, we questioned whether this augmentation was also reflected at the level of H chain mRNA expression. 10(-9)M SP induced modest increases (50 to 60%) in mu-chain mRNA expression by LPS-stimulated 5F5 cells when compared with cells stimulated with LPS alone. The 4F10 cells did not display this magnitude of difference for alpha-chain mRNA expression. Thus, although SP-induced increases of mu-chain mRNA by 5F5 cells may contribute to the increased Ig secretion observed by these LPS-activated lymphocytes, it is unlikely that increased mRNA expression can totally account for the threefold increases in secretion that were observed.\r"

  ".W": "We have used an approach of linking previously characterized T cell epitopes into immunologically complex synthetic peptides in order to investigate the mechanism of immunodominance. Our results show that first, cI12-26 is highly dominant following immunization with the lambda repressor (cI) protein, but is a minor epitope in the context of the cI:NP peptide. In contrast, the dominant epitope in response to the cI:NP peptide is a new junctional epitope, which is composed of sequences derived from both the cI and influenza nucleoprotein (NP) segments of the composite peptide. Second, T cell recognition of cI:NP is not significantly altered by Ag processing, based on results from glutaraldehyde-fixed APC. Third, the relative affinities of cI and cI:NP for MHC binding are similar, based on in vitro competition, excluding competition at the level of MHC binding as the determinant of immunodominance. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that immunodominance of cI:NP is determined by peptide conformation, which affects the configuration of peptide binding to MHC, thus altering T cell recognition. In conclusion, immunodominance is not simply a function of the primary amino acid sequence, but is a function of the context of the epitope within the protein molecule.\r"

  ".U": "91170766\r", 
  ".W": "The neonatal injection of semiallogeneic F1 spleen cells into newborn parental mice results in the induction of tolerance to the corresponding alloantigen (alloAg) and chimerism. In these F1 cell-injected mice, we have previously observed that this state of specific tolerance is associated with the development of a transient lupus-like autoimmune syndrome. In this study, we show that neonatal injection of mice with spleen cells differing from the host at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, class II, class (I + II), or minor lymphocyte stimulating (Mls) alloAg induced a state of specific tolerance characterized by the absence of alloreactive CTL and/or Th cell responses in the spleen and the thymus of 6- to 12-week-old injected mice. However, in mice rendered tolerant to MHC class II or class (I + II) alloAg, the presence of high levels of IgG1 antibodies, of circulating immune complexes, of anti-ssDNA autoantibodies, and of tissue lesions were transiently observed. In these mice, an increased Ia Ag expression on lymphoid spleen cells was also detected at 1 wk. The elevated production of IgG1 and the overexpression of Ia Ag were almost completely prevented by treatment with an anti-IL-4 mAb. Such manifestations of B cell activation and autoimmunity were not observed in mice neonatally injected with F1 cells differing from the host only at MHC class I Ag. In mice neonatally tolerized to Mls Ag, a transient increase in IgG2a production and an overexpression of Ia Ag were detected without features of autoimmunity, and were prevented by anti-INF-gamma mAb treatment. In mice rendered tolerant to MHC class II, class (I + II), or Mls alloAg at birth, the manifestations of B cell activation were associated with the presence of in vivo-activated alloreactive CD4+ T cells in the spleen--but not the thymus--of 1-wk-old injected mice. Together, these results suggest that in mice neonatally injected with semiallogeneic F1 cells, the process of tolerance induction is not efficient during the early postnatal period, and could allow the maturation and peripheralization of some alloreactive CD4+ T cells, leading to transient B cell activation and, depending on the alloAg, to autoimmunity.\r"

  ".U": "91170767\r", 
  ".W": "The \"low affinity\" Fc receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RII) has been reported to be absent from normal murine and human B cells that express a membrane (m)Ig isotype other than mIgM or mIgD in vivo. This would suggest that Fc epsilon RII expression is specifically lost after in vivo Ig isotype switching. We demonstrate that during a murine immune response to the bacterium Brucella abortus, to goat anti-mouse IgD (G alpha M delta) antibody, or to infection with the nematode parasites Nippostrongylus brasilienis or Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Fc epsilon RII expression is low or absent on virtually all B cells secreting IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgE. However, up to 50% of B cells that express mIgG1 after G alpha M delta injection continue to express Fc epsilon RII. These mIgG1 + Fc epsilon RII+ cells secrete little, if any, IgG1 when placed in vitro, in contrast to their mIgG1 + Fc epsilon RII- counterparts. The mIgG1 + Fc epsilon RII+ cells may be a transitional cell population, because they undergo substantial loss of Fc epsilon RII in culture, unlike mIgM+ Fc epsilon RII+ cells, which maintain constant levels of Fc epsilon RII throughout a comparable culture period. Thus, low or absent expression of Fc epsilon RII after immunization in vivo is directly associated with B cell differentiation to Ig production in the presence or absence of Ig isotype switching. However, all post-switched B cells may eventually lack Fc epsilon RII expression, independently of their differentiative state.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of human KC to IFN-gamma increases their susceptibility to lysis by CTL. The mechanism of this enhanced lysis was investigated by analyzing interactions of IFN-gamma-treated and nontreated cultured KC with allogeneic class I-specific CTL clones. rIFN-gamma treatment augmented KC lysis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Increased lysis of IFN-KC was detected after only 2 h of IFN-gamma treatment and was maximal by 12 h. Enhanced lysis of IFN-KC was Ag-specific, inasmuch as nonantigenic IFN-KC were not lysed either directly or as bystanders during the lysis of antigenic KC. Parallel immunofluorescence and cytotoxicity assays of KC treated with IFN-gamma for various intervals revealed a direct correlation between the degree of increased KC lysis and levels of cell surface ICAM-1 (CD54), but not of specific alloantigen or beta 2-microglobulin. Lysis of nontreated KC was blocked by mAb against class I or CD3, but not by mAb against ICAM-1 or LFA-1. In contrast, lysis of IFN-KC was partially inhibited by anti-ICAM-1 or anti-LFA-1 mAb, but resisted inhibition by anti-class I mAb except in the presence of anti-ICAM-1. These results indicate that both ICAM-1/LFA-1 and Ag/CD3-TcR interactions are important for Ag-specific lysis of IFN-KC, whereas lysis of nontreated KC depends on Ag/CD3-TcR but not ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions. Equivalent inhibition of IFN-KC lysis by mAb against ICAM-1 or LFA-1 suggests that ICAM-1 is the only LFA-1 ligand involved in enhanced IFN-KC lysis. Furthermore, enhanced CTL lysis of KC after short-term IFN-gamma treatment can be explained solely on the basis of ICAM-1 induction, because all of the increase in specific lysis associated with IFN-gamma treatment could be blocked by mAb that block ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions.\r"

Anti-6C2 is reactive with approximately 50% of unfractionated T cells, 50% of CD4+ cells, and 40% of CD8+ cells. Regarding CD4+ cells, anti-6C2-reactive cells substantially overlap with the CD29+CD45RO+ Th cell population. Moreover, anti-6C2 can divide these T cells into 6C2+ and 6C2- subpopulations. The CD4+CD45RO+6C2+ cells maximally respond to soluble Ag such as tetanus toxoid and provide strong helper function for PWM-driven B cell IgG synthesis. Most interestingly, anti-6C2 was also reactive against activated B cells but not resting B cells; furthermore, this epitope was inducible through activation of resting B cells or B cell line. Biochemical characterization showed that anti-6C2 precipitated two glycoproteins with the relative molecular weights of 180,000 and 95,000 from 125I-surface labeled cell lysate. Sequential immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that these two glycoproteins were the lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) Ag complex (CD11a/18). Significantly, although this antibody did not inhibit cytotoxic killer T cell responses and Ag-induced T cell proliferation as did conventional anti-LFA-1, it did inhibit PWM-driven B cell IgG synthesis. Because 6C2 expression was induced after B cell activation, the above results strongly suggest that the 6C2 molecule may play a role in the interaction of CD4 helper cells and activated B lymphocytes.\r"

The responding cells were PBMC from unrelated, HIV- donors that were either unfractionated or depleted of APC by plastic and nylon wool adherence. Using this approach, we observed no defect in the APC/SC potential of PBMC from Walter Reed stage 1 and 2 patients. However, PBMC from AIDS patients used as allogeneic stimulators exhibited three different patterns of APC/SC function: 1) no defect in alloantigen (ALLO) APC/SC potential; 2) a defect in ALLO APC/SC function that was detected only if the responder cells were depleted of APC (presenting cell defect); and 3) a defect in ALLO APC/SC function, irrespective of whether the responder cells were depleted of APC (stimulating cell defect). These results indicate that in addition to Th cell defects associated with AIDS, the PBMC from AIDS patients can also exhibit a defect in APC/SC function. This study provides an approach that permits the testing of Ag-presenting function in all AIDS patients, and is therefore not limited to testing patients for whom HIV-, HLA-identical T cells and APC are available.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we have investigated the basic requirements for HIV-1 infection of CD8+ lymphocytes in vitro. Unfractionated PBL obtained from healthy HIV-1 seronegative donors were activated with PHA and infected in vitro with HIV-1LAV. Based on immunofluorescent labeling, the vast majority of cells (85 to 97%) surviving peak virus replication belonged to the CD8+ subset and only a small percentage (0.5 to 1.5%) were CD4+. Amplification of HIV-1 proviral sequences by polymerase chain reaction performed on the sorted surviving CD8+ cells demonstrated that CD8+ cells harbored HIV-1 proviral DNA. In addition, stimulation of these HIV-1-infected, CD8(+)-sorted cells either with PHA or anti-CD2 mAb resulted in induction of virus replication, as measured by reverse transcriptase activity. Electron microscopic analysis of CD8+ cells chronically infected with HIV-1 and stimulated with PHA showed typical virions budding from, and associated with, the surface of cells immunolabeled with gold beads directed toward the CD8 molecule. Infection of CD8+ cells with HIV-1 occurred only when CD4+ cells were present in the PHA-activated lymphocyte population exposed to HIV-1 at the beginning of the culture or when sorted CD8+CD4- lymphocytes were cocultured with autologous sorted CD8-CD4+ cells that had been previously infected with HIV-1. Coculture of these cells with PHA-blasts and incubation of their supernatants with a CD4+ cell line showed that these chronically infected CD8+ cells could spread HIV-1 infection to uninfected CD4+ cells after stimulation with PHA or anti-CD2 mAb. Therefore, these results suggest that the minimal requirement for in vitro infection of CD3+CD8+CD4- lymphocytes is the presence of infected CD4+ cells and that infected CD8+ T lymphocytes can further spread the infection to CD4+ cells.\r"

However, recent transgenic studies have indicated that non-lymphoid expression of class II genes in the pancreas, liver, and kidney is either innocuous or induces peripheral tolerance. To test this hypothesis in another organ-specific autoimmune disease, we attempted to induce autoimmune thyroiditis in normal mice with class II+ thyroid tissue. Normal thyroid lobes were cultured with and without IFN-gamma and then transplanted to adult isogeneic recipients. The thyroid that had been induced to express class II genes by IFN-gamma was destroyed in normal mice, whereas the control cultured thyroid and the native cervical gland survived. Both types of transplants remained intact and functional in congenic nu/nu recipients, indicating that neither exposure to IFN-gamma nor expression of class II genes compromised the thyroid. Thus, in some tissues, exposure to IFN-gamma and/or the induction of class II expression can lead to T-dependent autoimmune disease.\r"

Propagation of AChR-specific T cell lines was attempted unsuccessfully from four other myasthenia gravis patients and from four healthy controls. The lines had CD3+, CD4+, CD8- phenotype, strongly recognized the delta-pool, and cross-reacted vigorously with non-denatured AChR purified from mammalian muscle. They did not cross-react detectably with pools of similar overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the complete sequences of the alpha- and gamma-subunits of human muscle AChR. The sequence segments of the delta-subunit that contain T epitopes were identified by investigating the response of the three CD4+ T cell lines to the individual synthetic peptides forming the delta-pool. Each line had an individual pattern of peptide recognition. Although no immunodominant region, recognized in association with different DR haplotypes, could be identified, the sequence segments most strongly recognized by the CD4+ T cell lines were clustered within residues 121-290. One of the peptides more strongly recognized by the T cells corresponded to a sequence segment with high predicted propensity to form an amphipathic alpha-helix, a structural motif proposed to be typical of T epitopes.\r"

  ".W": "The sequence of activation signals that stimulate proliferation, differentiation, and selection of mature T cell subsets from immature, dull-CD5+/CD4-, CD8- double negative (bCD5), (dCD5/DN) thymocytes are still unclear. However, it is likely that cytokines play integral roles in these events. Here we report that IL-1, in the presence of Con A, supports the proliferation and differentiation of highly purified dCD5/DN precursors into bright-CD5+ DN, CD2- lymphocytes with an apparently mature phenotype. These cells express CD3 and preferentially express the products of two TCR gene families, V beta 8 and V beta 6, whose expression is dependent on the allelic expression of the Mls-1 locus. Experiments, using DN thymocytes mixed with purified dCD5 subset of DN cells from a congenic strain of mice (i.e., expressing two different alleles of CD5) have shown that the cells that are stimulated by IL-1 and comitogen are derived from the immature dCD5 subset and not from the mature bCD5 cells contained within the DN subset. In contrast, IL-2 with the co-mitogen stimulates three- to fourfold higher levels of proliferation, from the same purified immature precursor population, and nearly a twofold increase in cell yield. However, the cells that were generated from precursor thymic cells stimulated with IL-2 represent a completely different T cell subset compared to IL-1-generated cells; these IL-2-stimulated cells express comparable levels of CD3, but also express substantial levels of CD2 and the TCR-gamma/delta, and a subset expresses CD8. These data suggest that these two TCR-alpha/beta and TCR-gamma/delta subsets of mature thymocytes use different cytokines and therefore possibly different stromal interactions to initiate differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "FK-506, a macrolide that binds with high affinity to a specific binding protein, and the structurally related macrolide rapamycin (RAP) were compared to cyclosporin A (CsA) for their effects on the release of preformed (histamine) and de novo synthesized (peptide leukotriene C4) inflammatory mediators from human basophils. FK-506 (1 to 300 nM) concentration dependently inhibited histamine release from basophils activated by Der p I Ag, anti-IgE, or compound A23187. FK-506 was more potent than CsA when basophils were challenged with Ag (IC50 = 25.5 +/- 9.5 vs 834.3 +/- 79.8 nM; p less than 0.001), anti-IgE (IC50 = 9.4 +/- 1.7 vs 441.3 +/- 106.7 nM; p less than 0.001), and A23187 (IC50 = 4.1 +/- 0.9 vs 36.7 +/- 3.8 nM; p less than 0.001). The maximal inhibitory effect of FK-506 was higher than that caused by CsA when basophils were activated by Der p I (80.0 +/- 3.6 vs 49.5 +/- 4.7%; p less than 0.001) and anti-IgE (90.4 +/- 1.8 vs 62.3 +/- 2.9%; p less than 0.001). FK-506 had little or no effect on the release of histamine caused by f-met peptide, phorbol myristate (12-tetradecanoyloxy-13-acetoxy-phorbol), and bryostatin 1. RAP (30 to 1000 nM) selectively inhibited only IgE-mediated histamine release from basophils, although it had no effect on mediator release caused by f-met peptide, A23187, 12-tetradecanoyloxy-13-acetoxy-phorbol, and bryostatin 1. FK-506 also inhibited the de novo synthesis of sulfidopeptide leukotriene C4 from basophils challenged with anti-IgE. Low concentrations of FK-506 and CsA synergistically inhibited the release of mediators from basophils induced by anti-IgE or compound A23187. IL-3 (3 and 10 ng/ml), but not IL-1 beta (10 and 100 ng/ml), reversed the inhibitory effect of both FK-506 and CsA on basophils challenged with anti-IgE or A23187. RAP was a competitive antagonist of the inhibitory effect of FK-506 on A23187-induced histamine release from basophils with a dissociation constant of about 30 nM. In contrast, RAP did not modify the inhibitory effect of CsA on A23187-induced histamine release. These data indicate that FK-506 is a potent antiinflammatory agent that acts on human basophils presumably by binding to a receptor site (i.e., FK-506 binding protein).\r"

  ".W": "PGE2 or products increasing the intracellular concentration of cAMP (cAMP)i) had opposite effects on the induction of IFN-gamma in a CTL clone, depending on the inducing agent. Activation via the TCR was inhibited, whereas induction by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin was enhanced in the presence of agents increasing (cAMP)i. Synergy between Ca2(+)-dependent and cAMP-dependent pathways was independent of the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Low levels of IFN-gamma mRNA could be detected transiently after induction with ionomycin alone, whereas simultaneous induction with agents increasing (cAMP)i led to enhanced levels of IFN-gamma mRNA detectable up to 12 h. No IFN-gamma mRNA was detected when the CTL were activated with (cAMP)i-increasing agents alone or with PKC-activating agents such as PMA, suggesting that the transcriptional activation of the IFN-gamma gene was strictly dependent on the Ca2(+)-mediated and cyclosporin A-dependent event. Analyses of IFN-gamma mRNA transcription by \"run-on\" experiments on nuclei isolated after activation of the CTL indicated that the Ca2+ signal alone induces maximal transcription of the IFN-gamma gene, which is not increased by either PKC activation or an increase in cAMP, but that further processing or stabilization of the IFN-gamma precursor or mature mRNA require an additional signal, provided either via a PKC or via a PKA activation pathway. The data also suggest that a combination of inflammatory products leading to an increase in (Ca2+)i and to an increase in (cAMP)i may bypass the usually stringent control of T cell activation by the TCR/CD3 complex.\r"

  ".W": "Antibodies that lyse trypomastigotes in a complement-mediated reaction are believed to be the main participants in the protection against virulent Trypanosoma cruzi. Antibodies with a specificity for alpha-galactosyl-containing determinants--generally called antiGal--were studied to determine their role in the lysis of trypomastigote forms. The titers of antiGal markedly increase in Chagas's disease. In the present study we demonstrate binding of this antibody to T. cruzi and the complement-mediated lysis of trypomastigotes by antiGal. Lysis of metacyclic trypomastigotes by whole Chagasic (Ch) serum or isolated antiGal fractions was equally inhibited by alpha- but not by beta-galactosides. Most of the lytic power of the Ch antiGal as well as of the whole Ch serum was removed by absorption on Synsorb-linked Gal alpha 1, 3Gal beta 1, 4GlcNAc followed by rabbit erythrocyte absorption. The Ch antiGal had a lower affinity for melibiose bound to agarose than for the trisaccharide linked to Synsorb, and was several times more effective in the immunolysis of trypomastigotes than the corresponding antiGal from normal human serum. Lytic antibodies were partly absorbed by Serratia marcescens but not by Escherichia coli O111. A human volunteer immunized with an S. marcescens vaccine elicited a specific antiGal response that was lytic to trypomastigotes (70% lysis). We suggest that in vivo high-affinity antiGal antibody clones, as occur in Ch patients, may significantly contribute to the destruction of the parasite, whereas low-affinity antiGal clones are much less effective in the protection against T. cruzi infection.\r"

We were unable to detect RFLP among several primates, and nucleotide sequences of several VHVI gene segments showed remarkable conservation. No differences were detected in the nucleotide sequences of the VHVI gene segment from three unrelated chimpanzees. These findings suggest that the VHVI gene segment has been strongly selected for during primate evolution, suggesting an important immunologic role.\r"

The glycine and serine codons are of germline V gamma 4 and J gamma 1 origin, respectively, whereas the N region consists of a variable amino acid residue x, followed by an invariant tyrosine Y. The high expression of V gamma 4 xYJ gamma 1C gamma 1 in the lung of BALB/c mice compared to that of C57BL/6 is apparently due to a novel pattern of strain-dependent positive selection which, unlike for alpha beta TCR, operates extrathymically. This type of selection seems to be determined by strain specific polymorphic ligands encoded outside of the classical H-2 region.\r"

  ".U": "91170807\r", 
  ".W": "The role of IL-4 in proliferation and differentiation of human NK cells was studied using newly established sublines of an IL-4-dependent NK cell clone (IL4d-NK cells) and an IL-2-dependent NK cell clone (IL2d-NK cells) derived from a parental conditioned medium-dependent NK cell clone (CM-NK cells). IL-4 induced the higher proliferation of CM-NK cells, but abolished their NK activity and decreased CD16 and CD56 Ag expression. In contrast, IL-2 induced the higher NK activity and increased CD16 and CD56 Ag expression. Addition of anti-IL-4 antibody to the culture of CM-NK cells with CM inhibited the proliferation, but slightly increased NK activity, and largely increased CD56 Ag expression. Addition of anti-IL-2 antibody to the culture of CM-NK cells with CM inhibited both proliferation and cytotoxicity. Proliferation of IL4d-NK cells, which is totally dependent on rIL-4, is greater than that of IL2d-NK cells, which was greater than parental CM-NK cells. Morphologically, IL4d-NK cells are small and round, whereas IL2d-NK cells are large and elongated. Anti-IL-4 antibody inhibited proliferation of IL4d-NK but not IL2d-NK cells, whereas anti-IL-2 antibody inhibited that of IL2d-NK but not IL4d-NK cells. IL-2 was not detected in the supernatant from IL4d-NK cells, nor was IL-2-mRNA expressed in IL4d-NK cells. In contrast, IFN-gamma production and protein expression in IL4d- and IL2d-NK cells were detected. NK cell activation markers (CD16 and CD56) were expressed on IL2d-NK cells but not IL4d-NK cells. IL4d-NK cells were not cytotoxic to any tumor cells tested, whereas IL2d-NK cells displayed potent NK activity and lymphokine-activated killer activity. IL4d-NK cells failed to bind K562 tumor cells, whereas one-third of the IL2d-NK cells did. IL4d-NK cells responded to rIL-2, proliferated, and differentiated into cytotoxic NK cells, whereas IL2d-NK cells failed to respond to rIL-4 and died. These results raise a possibility that IL4d-NK cells or IL2d-NK cells primarily represent the immunologic properties of immature or activated types of human NK cells, respectively. Our results provide the first evidence of the capability of IL-4 to support continuous proliferation of a lymphocyte clone with immature NK cell characteristics and to stimulate IFN-gamma production in the clone. IL-4 is suggested as a potential growth factor for certain types of human NK cell progenitors.\r"

Oocytes progressing to the PB-1 stage were inseminated in vitro. In vitro fertilization (IVF) of pooled in vitro matured (IVM) PB-1 oocytes (judged by two-cell formation) was 19.9%, which was significantly lower than in the group of in vivo matured oocytes (74.4%).

Sixty-three patients received gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), and 137 received hMG only. The GnRHa + hMG protocol resulted in higher pregnancy rates than the hMG-only protocol (19.0 vs 9.5%, respectively; P less than 0.01) despite a lower cleavage rate. Oocyte retrieval was performed via laparoscopy in 100 patients and transvaginally in 100 patients. The number of oocytes recovered per cycle was 6.1 +/- 3.9 with laparoscopy and 7.0 +/- 3.1 transvaginally. Pregnancy rates were similar for both retrieval techniques (13 and 12%, respectively). A breakdown of these results showed that the advantage for the GnRHa + hMG protocol was not affected by the oocyte retrieval technique. A comparison of simultaneous blood and follicular fluid pH measured every 10 min during laparoscopy and transvaginal oocyte recovery revealed a constant decline in follicular fluid pH during laparoscopy, while no changes were observed during the vaginal procedure. We conclude that the improvement in in vitro fertilization results during the period of our study is due primarily to the introduction of GnRHa + hMG protocol rather than the method of oocyte retrieval.\r"

All patients suffered from tubal infertility and were not older than 40 years. Each woman was allocated randomly to one of three groups: the conventional treatment with hMG alone (group I), patients from group II started the hMG treatment shortly after the LH rise caused by the GnRH agonist and patients in group III commenced the hMG treatment when an hypogonadotropic state was achieved after a long treatment of Buserelin. All male partners had a normal spermiogram. A reduction of poor responders to the superovulation is seen in the short-term group (6%), compared with the other two groups (14%). In some cases from group III ovarian cyst formation led to the cancellation of the treatment. The long-term group differs significantly from the other two in the duration of the gonadotropin stimulation and the number of ampoules hMG used. A severe ovarian overstimulation syndrome was not observed. There is no difference in the number of retrieved oocytes and the fertilization rate among the three groups. The pregnancy rate per cycle or per patient in the group with a short-term GnRH-agonist regimen is significantly higher compared to that of the group using the conventional hMG treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of type I and II collagens, fibronectin and the fibronectin-integrin receptor, tenascin, laminin, link protein, and cartilage-specific glycosaminoglycans was examined in the primate temporomandibular joint complex using an immunohistochemical approach. In general, type I collagen, fibronectin, and the fibronectin-integrin receptor were found to co-distribute throughout the joint complex. Immunostaining for these proteins was notably intense in the prechondroblastic and mineralization zones of the articular cartilages of the joint. Tenascin was identified in several structures of the joint, including the articular cartilages, where intense staining was observed in the prechondroblastic and cartilagenous zones. Laminin was detected only in the adventitia of blood vessels located in the attachment tissues of the disc and joint synovium. Cartilage-specific glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen were observed in the cartilagenous zones of the articular cartilages of the mandibular condyle and temporal bone. In addition, immunostaining for cartilage-specific glycosaminoglycans also was detected throughout the extracellular matrix surrounding \"chondrocyte-like\" cells located in the joint disc. Despite the localization of cartilage-specific glycosaminoglycans in the disc, type II collagen was not detected in this structure. It is suggested that a fibronectin-integrin receptor mechanism may be involved in the regulation of growth of the articular cartilages of the temporomandibular joint.\r"

In the hypertensive rats, i.v. infusion of C-ANF(4-23) produced depressor responses of approximately 25 mm Hg, but did not significantly affect plasma ANF concentration or stimulate cyclic GMP excretion. In contrast, SQ 28,603 (300 mumol/kg i.v.) significantly reduced MAP and increased excretion of sodium and cyclic GMP. When C-ANF(4-23) was administered in combination with SQ 28,603, the depressor activity was additive and plasma ANF concentrations were significantly increased. The excretion of cyclic GMP was slightly enhanced, but, was not significantly different from the effects of SQ 28,603 alone. Neither SQ 28,603 nor C-ANF(4-23) affected MAP or plasma ANF in the normotensive rats. Finally, the in vitro hydrolysis of C-ANF(4-23) by NEP was prevented by SQ 28,603, indicating that inhibition of NEP may protect peptides recognized by the clearance receptors as well as the biological receptors for ANF. Therefore, the additive effects of C-ANF(4-23) and SQ 28,603 may be due to blockade of separate pathways which inactivate ANF or to the inhibition of C-ANF(4-23) degradation by NEP.\r"

  ".U": "91171184\r", 
  ".W": "Ethanol is proposed to exert its pharmacological effects by increasing membrane fluidity. Support for this hypothesis comes from strong correlations between in vitro effects of ethanol and pharmacological effects and genetic variation seen in vivo. Because arachidonate acid (AA) cascade is a membrane-bound system activated by disruptions in the cell membrane, it is possible that ethanol-induced membrane fluidization increases the formation of AA metabolites such as prostaglandins. The studies reported here were designed to characterize systematically the ability of various prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase (PES; prostaglandin synthetase or cyclooxygenase) inhibitors to antagonize the effects of ethanol. A wide range of chemically diverse PES inhibitors significantly antagonized the rate-depressant effects and acute narcosis caused by ethanol. The ability of these compounds to antagonize the effects of ethanol was significantly correlated with two measures of PES activity; in vitro inhibition of the PES enzyme and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. These significant potency correlations between the ability of PES inhibitors to antagonize in vivo acute ethanol hypnosis and their ability to inhibit in vitro and in vivo conversion of AA to AA metabolites strongly suggest an underlying functional relationship. These results obtained from two divergent dependent measures of the effects of ethanol, duration of loss of the righting reflex and rate depressant effects, extend the range of ethanol-related behaviors that PES inhibitors effectively antagonize and provide substantive evidence in support of a mechanistic role for PES and related metabolites in the central effects of ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "Zileuton [N-(1-benzo[b]thien-2-ylethyl)-N-hydroxyure] inhibited 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid synthesis by rat basophilic leukemia cell 20,000 x g supernatant and rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) (IC50 = 0.5 and 0.3 microM) respectively. It also inhibited leukotriene (LT)B4 biosynthesis by rat PMNL (IC50 = 0.4 microM), human PMNL (IC50 = 0.4 microM) and human whole blood (IC50 = 0.9 microM). Inhibition of human PMNL LTB4 biosynthesis was removed readily by a simple wash procedure. At concentrations up to 100 microM, the compound produced little or no inhibition of several related enzymes, such as platelet 12-lipoxygenase, soybean and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase and sheep seminal vesicle cyclooxygenase. At p.o. doses from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg in the dog, zileuton produced a rapid and sustained inhibition of ex vivo blood LTB4 biosynthesis which correlated with the pharmacokinetic behavior of the compound. In a similar ex vivo study in the rat, the compound displayed an p.o. ED50 of 2 mg/kg. Zileuton was highly effective in preventing 6-sulfidopeptide LT formation in the rat peritoneal cavity triggered by an antigen-antibody reaction with an ED50 of 3 mg/kg. In experimental models of inflammation, zileuton significantly reduced arachidonic-acid induced mouse ear edema (ED50 = 31 mg/kg) and also attenuated inflammatory cell accumulation in the rat pleural Arthus reaction. The effectiveness of this compound for preventing LT formation in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo suggests its utility for preventing the pathophysiological effects of the LTs and other 5-lipoxygenase products in animals and in humans.\r"

While publication of risk-adjusted hospital-specific death rates is one response, debate continues over whether higher than predicted mortality is a warning about quality of care or rather a reflection of a hospital's atypical patient population. To help inform this debate, we compared the characteristics of Medicare patients discharged from 187 hospitals that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) had labeled \"high-mortality outliers\" with those of Medicare patients from 5373 hospitals not so designated. Hospitals were most likely to be flagged as high-mortality outliers by HCFA when they had large shares of very elderly patients (age greater than or equal to 85 years), patients with high-risk diagnoses, or patients requiring nursing home care. After adjustments were made to compensate for these biases, nearly half the hospitals flagged as outliers by HCFA were no longer so designated. Statistics purporting to measure effectiveness of care from hospital death rates should be modified to account for diversity in patient mix.\r"
