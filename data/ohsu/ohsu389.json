  ".W": "Twenty-six adults, ages 27 to 60, with refractory metastatic solid tumors were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) + carmustine (BCNU) at one of three escalating dose schedules followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Toxicity was severe and dose-related, with the maximum tolerated dose for the combination determined to be Cy 160 mg/kg and BCNU 900 mg/m2. Median time to WBC recovery (greater than or equal to 1,000/microL) was 13 days post-ABMT (range, nine to 22 days) and to a platelet count of greater than or equal to 50,000/microL, 22 days (range, 13 to 83 days). Sixteen of 20 evaluable patients (80%) responded to therapy with at least 50% reduction in measurable tumor, and three patients achieved complete remission (CR). Responders included eight of nine evaluable patients with breast carcinoma, two of five with melanoma, two of two with sarcoma, and four of four with colon carcinoma. Response durations were short (median, 4 months), even for complete responders, and relapses generally occurred at sites of previous metastases. In order for this approach to have a more significant impact on overall survival, it may need to be applied earlier in the natural history of the malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Diffuse large-cell lymphoma is one of the neoplasms curable with chemotherapy in an appreciable percentage of patients. However, all patients are not cured and the best combination of agents is not certain. This reflects the lack of completed comparative trials using the regimens that appear most effective. Despite this uncertainty, several principles for the therapy of diffuse large-cell lymphoma can be identified that allow an analysis of the results reported in the literature. These principles include the following: (1) for a regimen to be curative in a substantial number of patients it must achieve a high rate of complete remissions; (2) cure must be accomplished with frontline therapy; (3) drugs must be delivered at curative doses; (4) rapidity of achieving a complete response might be related to chance for cure; (5) prolonged treatment for diffuse large-cell lymphoma is unnecessary; and (6) aggressive therapy is toxic. In analyzing the results with any regimen it is important to have long follow-up since late relapses do occur and initial very positive results tend to decay with greater numbers of patients treated. Applying these principles to the reported chemotherapy studies in patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma suggest that no one of the new regimens is clearly superior to the others. Also, it is not clear that cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) delivered at full doses to comparable patients is inferior to the newer regimens. The results of ongoing studies comparing these regimens might help resolve these questions.\r"

Patients receiving perioperative blood transfusions have a significantly worse prognosis than patients undergoing cancer surgery without a perioperative transfusion. It is thought that this is because transfusions produce a nonspecific immunosuppression by increasing the number and/or activity of suppressor T lymphocytes, decreasing the number of natural killer cells, and inducing anti-idiotypic antibodies. This risk, particularly when considered with the other risks of transfusion such as hepatitis or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), suggests that criteria for transfusion of these patients should be stringent and related to an unequivocal need for replenishment of RBCs.\r"

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a wall motion score (WM) were calculated from CA. LVEF was also obtained from cardiac blood-pool imaging, and defect size (DS) from 201Tl SPECT. Results demonstrated that all parameters were significantly improved in patients treated with APSAC versus heparin (contrast LVEF 53 +/- 13 vs. 47 +/- 14 p less than 0.01, WM 9.8 +/- 6.5 vs. 13.3 +/- 7.9 p less than 0.001, radionuclide LVEF 43 +/- 12 vs. 40 +/- 13 p less than 0.05, DS 14 +/- 12 vs. 18 +/- 14 p less than 0.05). When the patients were divided according to infarct site and infarct-related coronary artery patency, it was demonstrated with all four parameters that the beneficial effect of APSAC can be largely explained by the lower incidence of vessel obstruction in this group (37% vs. 77% in the heparin group, p less than 0.001). It is concluded that (a) when compared with heparin and in the conditions of the trial, APSAC significantly improves the cardiac function and decreases the DS and (b) DS measured by 201Tl SPECT is as valuable a quantitative parameter of therapeutic evaluation as are LVEF and WM.\r"

The agents included [99mTc]DTPA, [131I]hippuran, [111In]lysozyme, [99mTc]glucoheptonate (GHA), [99mTc]dimercaptosuccinate (DMS) and [111In]aminated dextran (amdex). A small dose of [99mTc]- or [111In]DTPA was administered simultaneously to normalize the results for variations in drug response from one animal to another. There were statistically significant differences in the detectability of the renal functional impairment by plasma clearance, early and 2-hr renal uptake among the different agents. However, none was clearly superior to DTPA. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies which showed a parallel decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow in acute CyA toxicity probably due primarily to vasoconstriction.\r"

The vascular endothelium has been shown to play an active role in preventing blood clot formation in vivo. The endothelial cell surface contains a thrombin-binding protein, thrombomodulin, which, when complexed with thrombin, activates vitamin K-dependent protein C, an endogenous anticoagulant. Protein C and its cofactor, protein S, inhibit the clotting process by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa and, additionally, enhance the lysis of fibrin. It has been demonstrated by the detection of heterozygous and homozygous protein C-deficient patients with severe thrombotic complications that protein C is a major regulatory protein of hemostasis and thrombosis. This endogenous anticoagulant pathway is providing a better understanding of both congenital and acquired thrombotic disorders.\r"

Of 85 infants with 1-minute Apgar score 0 to 3, 44 received an injection of naloxone (approximately 0.4 mg/kg) and 41 received saline solution. In 108 infants with 1-minute Apgar score 4 to 6, 54 received naloxone and 54 saline solution. In neither group was there a significant effect of naloxone on respiratory frequency or heart rate up to 30 minutes after injection, nor at 24 hours of age. In both groups active muscle tone of upper and lower limbs was increased by naloxone, a response that may not be beneficial in the face of inadequate oxygen delivery to vital organs. We conclude that naloxone at this dose had no readily apparent benefit in the resuscitation of the asphyxiated newborn infant.\r"

The mean gestational age was 26.8 weeks (SD 2.2 weeks), and mean birth weight was 830 gm (SD 276 gm). The diagnosis of renal calcification was made at a mean age of 12 weeks (SD 6.5 weeks) by abdominal x-ray examination, screening abdominal ultrasound studies or, both. Calcification was associated with both furosemide therapy and the presence of multiple potential risk factors. Renal calcification, length, and function were subsequently evaluated in nine patients at a mean age of 21.3 months (SD 15.3 months). Improvement in calcification occurred in five patients, with total resolution in four. Renal length, determined by ultrasound examination and corrected for body length, was normal in 17 of 18 kidneys. Serum creatinine values and calculated glomerular filtration rates were abnormal in four of nine patients. We conclude that renal calcification in preterm infants is associated with multiple risk factors, including furosemide usage, and tends to diminish during the first year of life. However, renal function may remain compromised in some patients.\r"

All regimens contained 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin (FA) but differed in the third drug: semustine (Me), triazinate (T), or cisplatin (P). FAT produced significantly superior overall survival (P less than .01) compared to FAMe. One-year survival rate for the FAT regimen was 30% compared to 15% for the FAMe regimen, and median survival times were 30 versus 24 weeks, respectively. The FAP regimen demonstrated a similar survival advantage compared to the FAMe regimen. The improved survival was observed despite decreased 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin dosages for patients on the FAT and FAP arms. Severe toxicity rates were 42% for FAT, 69% for FAP, and 62% for FAMe. The FAT regimen produced significantly less hematologic toxicity than either FAP or FAMe, while mild neurotoxicity was the limiting toxicity of cisplatin in this study. Two classes of drugs, without known risks of potentially fatal long-term toxic effects, appear to be effective substitutes for long-acting alkylating agents such as Me or mitomycin in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. These findings identify new approaches to therapy for this common disease.\r"

This review attempts to deal with both issues. The nature of the cells mediating lymphokine-activated killer activity, their heterogeneous phenotype, their activation requirements, and a hypothetical mechanism of action are discussed.

All responses were assessed by the criteria of the International Union Against Cancer. The response rates were 27% (29 of 106 patients) for AG and 31% (35 of 112) for MPA, but if stabilization of previously progressive disease is included, then the overall response rates were 51% (54 of 106) and 54% (61 of 112) for patients receiving AG or MPA, respectively. There was no difference in response to the two drugs at any site of disease, and the durations of response and survival were identical for the two drugs. The time to response was significantly shorter for patients treated with MPA (median, 8.7 wk) than for those treated with AG (median, 15.3 wk) (chi 2 = 9.96, 1 df, P = .0016). The percentage of patients experiencing toxic effects was equivalent in both arms, although the patterns and time courses of these effects were different.\r"

  ".W": "Since beta-1,3-glucan is a common component of fungal cell wall, its detection might be useful in diagnosing invasive candidiasis. Not only endotoxin but beta-1,3-glucan activates proclotting enzyme contained in a conventional chromogenic limulus test (CCLT). Endotoxin activates this enzyme through factor C, while the beta-1,3-glucan activates through factor G. Since endotoxin specific test (EST) contains factor C, endotoxin would be quantified. By subtracting EST value from CCLT value, beta-1,3-glucan would be quantified. We named this value Fungal Index (FI), and examined if it actually reflects the candidal infection. Ninety-two patients were tested for CCLT and EST prospectively. FI increased significantly in candidal infection (p less than 0.05) but remained low in GNR infection. Moreover, FI increased proportionally to the severity of candidal infection. Elevated FI decreased when antifungal therapy was successful. Thus FI was a useful index not only in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis but also in the evaluation of antifungal therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the efficacy and safety of fibrin glue (FG) made with highly concentrated human fibrinogen and clotting factors in achieving hemostasis of superficial and deep hepatic injuries. Experimentally produced hepatic injuries were produced in 12 adult mongrel dogs and hemostatically sealed with FG. Half of the dogs each received two penetrating hepatic injuries consisting of a large laceration and a deep stab wound through the liver; the remaining dogs underwent resection of a large segment of the left lobe of the liver. Hemostasis was achieved by applying FG into and over the bleeding wounds; hepatic arterial occlusion was not used. Complete hemostasis was achieved in all animals before skin closure. One dog from each group was re-explored and the liver specimens harvested for gross and microscopic examination at postoperative intervals of 12 hours, 24 hours, and 2, 3, 6, and 8 weeks. There were no cases of intra-abdominal infection, abscess formation, or bile fistulae. Histologic examination demonstrated a thickened capsule containing fibrous connective tissue and neovascular proliferation; there were no signs of local or systemic toxicity. One dog died on postoperative day 1 from rebleeding from the hepatic injury; all other dogs survived without complications. We conclude that FG provides effective hemostasis of superficial and deep hepatic injuries, and has good systemic and local compatibility. Its use in surgery for hepatic trauma may lead to less intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements, as well as a reduced need for major hepatic resection to control hemorrhage.\r"

The program was developed as an \"expert system,\" using the techniques of artificial intelligence. It is able to suggest: the need for further examination; additional tests; diagnoses; and treatments. In this study, the advice offered by the expert system was compared to that of physicians-in-training. Five actual patient care situations were presented to the system and to 13 medical students and surgical residents: four MS-III, three PGY-I, three PGY-III, and three PGY-V. The suggestions of each of the 13 trainees, the advice of the expert system, and the actual management were blinded. Five surgeons versed in trauma and otherwise not involved in the project judged whether each of the 15 purported management plans was acceptable and ranked them in order of preference. Only the actual care and the advice from the system were judged acceptable for all five problems. The rankings of the expert system were better than those of any individual trainee. The differences were statistically significant for two of the three chief residents, five of nine residents overall, and all four students. This preliminary validation of a prototype expert system is encouraging for the prospect of a computerized decision support system that can help surgeons make initial definitive management plans for patients with major trauma.\r"

  ".W": "With available medical treatment programs a remission of stone disease could be achieved in more than 80 per cent of the patients and a decrease in individual stone formation rate obtained in greater than 90 per cent. The need for stone removal may be reduced dramatically by an effective prophylactic program. There is some evidence that certain stones (even calcareous types) may undergo dissolution in vivo with appropriate therapy. Moreover, properly applied medical treatments may be capable of overcoming nonrenal manifestations as well as preventing new stone formation. Thus, the potential development of bone disease in patients with renal tubular acidosis may be averted by potassium citrate therapy. Despite these advantages it is clear that the medical treatment approach cannot provide total control of the disease. Stone disease generally presents with a surgical problem related to an already formed stone before medical diagnosis and selective treatment may be applied. Some patients, albeit a minority, are recalcitrant to medical treatment no matter how heroic. A satisfactory response to medical treatment requires continued compliance by the patient to the recommended treatment program and a commitment by the physician to provide long-term followup care. There is no cure, only prophylaxis. The increasing ease and decreasing cost of new approaches to stone removal, particularly with the advent of second generation extracorporeal lithotripsy, will undoubtedly cast a continuing uncertainty on the need for medical diagnosis and treatment. Several factors might influence the choice between surgical and medical approaches. One factor is the severity of stone disease. Patients with repeated episodes of stone formation might be more likely to adopt preventive therapy, whereas those with infrequent stone episodes may elect simply to have them removed upon their occurrence without medical treatment between episodes. Also, the possibility that lithotripsy may cause long-term hazards (for example development of hypertension) must be clarified. Another factor is the occurrence of extrarenal manifestations. In patients suffering from systemic disorders in which nephrolithiasis is only 1 manifestation (for example distal renal tubular acidosis) a medical approach may be justified exclusive of effects on stone formation. Finally, one must consider the relative practicality and cost between stone removal and a medical approach. It is likely that improvements and reductions in costs will occur with both approaches. It is hoped that urologists and internists work jointly to find an appropriate balance between the 2 approaches.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The clinical efficacy of submucosal anal injections of methotrexate in advanced bladder cancer is investigated. An experimental study on 20 mice has shown that methotrexate injected into the anal submucosa has no clinicopathological effect on the anorectum. The clinical study comprised 18 patients with advanced bladder cancer (13 with stage T3 and 5 with stage T4 disease) as a test group in whom methotrexate was injected into the anal submucosa and 8 (6 with stage T3 and 2 with stage T4 cancer) treated concurrently with intravenous methotrexate. The dose in both groups was 50 mg. every 5 days for 5 consecutive doses. The course was repeated at 3-week intervals. Most patients received methotrexate as outpatients. Methotrexate blood levels were measured 4 and 24 hours after administration in both groups. In the test group 10 of the 18 patients showed complete tumor regression and were alive 21 to 50 months after the start of treatment. Partial regression was observed in 8 patients. Hematological reserve remained unchanged. Mild toxicity occurred in 3 patients. Of the 8 patients treated intravenously the tumor showed partial regression in 1, was stable in 3 and progressed in 4. Side effects were severe in 5 patients. Our results show that methotrexate injection is highly effective in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer. It is safe, well tolerated and can be used on an outpatient basis.\r"

In addition, the effect of this dose of prostaglandin E1 was compared to the effect of 7.5 mg. papaverine plus 0.25 mg. phentolamine in a double-blind, crossover designed study. We tested twice 12 men 52.9 +/- 7.6 years old (mean +/- standard deviation) with erectile dysfunction. On 1 occasion the subjects received 20 mcg. prostaglandin E1 and on the other they received 7.5 mg. papaverine and 0.25 mg. phentolamine. At this dosage prostaglandin E1 was most effective in inducing artificial penile erection (11 of 12 patients). However, 75 per cent of the subjects reported burning sensations during the entire period of erection and in 1 prostaglandin E1 treatment resulted in a sustained erection. At the doses used, prostaglandin E1 was more effective in inducing penile erection than papaverine plus phentolamine (11 versus 6 patients). Intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1 is a potent tool for artificial penile erection and warrants precise examination for its potential clinical use.\r"

Bacterial pili, filamentous protein cell surface-associated appendages, have been shown to mediate colonization of epithelial cells. Pili associated adhesins can be detected in vitro by their ability to mediate bacterial hemagglutination of erythrocytes. We have assessed the role of bacterial adhesins in supporting urethral colonization by determining the hemagglutination reactions of 56 E. coli isolates from the urethra of patients with indwelling urethral catheters. The adhesin detected most frequently was the type 1 mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (43%), and 43% of isolates failed to hemagglutinate guinea pig or human erythrocytes. E. coli hemagglutinins were no more common on urethral isolates from patients that were persistently colonized (E. coli present 70% of the time catheterized), than from those that were transiently colonized (E. coli present 30% of the time catheterized). Analysis of the HA reactions and DNA plasmid profiles of multiple isolates from persistently colonized patients suggested that the E. coli strain colonizing the urethra changed over time. The data suggest that bacterial colonization of the urethra is mediated in part by adhesins and changes over time.\r"

Prostate glands were removed from four adult male dogs. The prostates were divided in the midsaggital plane and one half of the prostate was resected using a resectoscope. Saturation experiments were performed on the resected and control prostatic tissue using 3H-NMS, 125I-Heat, and 3H-rauwolscine. The mean equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) and the mean densities of 3H-NMS, 125I-Heat, and 3H-Rauwolscine binding sites were similar in tissue homogenates obtained from control and resected portions of the prostate (p greater than 0.05). Resection of the prostate using electrocautery did not alter the binding properties of various neurotransmitter ligands for characterizing and quantifying muscarinic cholinergic, alpha 1 adrenergic, and alpha 2 adrenergic binding sites in the canine prostate. Approximately 90% of prostatectomies for symptomatic BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) are performed transurethrally. The ability to accurately measure neurotransmitter receptor densities in prostate tissues obtained following transurethral resection is imperative for our future studies designed to elucidate the role of alpha adrenergic receptors in the development of bladder outlet obstruction in men with BPH.\r"

This is a preliminary step toward the development of immunological methods to improve the cytologic detection of bladder carcinoma. In this study, McAb 3G2-C6 was used. The McAb reacts to a bladder tumor-associated cell-surface antigen expressed in bladder tumors of various grades. Bladder washings from patients with and without carcinoma were stained with the McAb using two different indirect immunofluorescence methods (Methods A and B). The results of the immunological studies were compared with those obtained from the cytology laboratory and these in turn, were evaluated against the histopathological diagnosis of respective patients at the time the samples were taken. Immunofluorescence method A detected positive cells in 87% (56/64) of specimens from bladder cancer patients, including 18 of 19 from patients with grade 1 tumor. This method also had a low false-positive rate; only one of 17 specimens from patients with other urinary disorders had positively reacting cells. Immunofluorescence method B, evaluating a second group of specimens, detected positive cells in 68% (15/22) of specimens from patients with carcinoma, and in only one of 17 controls. However, it also identified positive cells in specimens from patients with chronic cystitis and urinary calculi. Overall the results of these studies indicate that the McAb method is superior to the routine cytology in detecting tumor cells in bladder washing specimens. More work must be done, however, to improve the specificity of the method before it can be used as an aid for routine tumor detection.\r"

Only 15% of the subjects in each gum group stopped using the gum altogether because of side effects, but only 20% of the ad lib groups and 40% of the fixed-dosage group used at least eight pieces of gum per day during the first week. The abstinence rates (for at least seven days) at the six-month follow-up were 31% in both active gum groups and 22% in the placebo and no gum groups. Relapse rates in the two active gum groups were about half those in the placebo and no gum groups. Nicotine polacrilex may be a useful adjunct to minimal contact smoking cessation formats, which have broad appeal. Also, minimal contact relapse prevention programs may assist physicians in helping patients to maintain smoking cessation using nicotine polacrilex.\r"

We also need detailed information about the causal linkages among the structural attributes of the settings in which care occurs, the processes of care, and the outcomes of care. Specifying the components or outcomes of care to be sampled, formulating the appropriate criteria and standards, and obtaining the necessary information are the steps that follow. Though we know much about assessing quality, much remains to be known.\r"

The average cytostatic activity of TAM was 38.5 +/- 6.8% in patients without recurrence, although it was 25.2 +/- 4.6% in those with recurrence within 2 years after complete resection (P less than 0.1). The activity of macrophage activating factor (MAF) induced by TIL was also higher in patients showing no recurrence. A significant positive correlation was observed between MAF activity induced by TIL and the cytostatic activity of individual TAM. These results suggest that antitumor activity of TAM may be controlled by specifically sensitized TIL through lymphokines.\r"

The 5-year survival rate was 89% and the recurrence-free rate was 80%. In all of these trials, as well as in the report of Van Nagell et al (Cancer 57:1451-1454, 1986) of adjuvant vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) chemotherapy, there are too few patients to make any formal statistical comparison of the groups, although the surgery plus CYVADIC group appears to be the most promising.\r"

In melanomas with poor prognosis, preoperative treatment with topical 5-FU converts the cellular infiltrate from acute inflammatory cells to round cells which have been shown to be T-cells. We believe this preoperative stimulation of the patients' own immune reaction to the tumor may be of great significance in improving the surgical results for melanomas with a poor prognosis.\r"

These cancers developed as a result of chronic lymphedema of the involved limb following mastectomy 15 and 16 years ago, respectively, for breast carcinoma. Immunohistologic and electron microscopic examinations proved that this tumor originates in the vascular endotheliocytes, even though they are clinically chronic lesions apparently derived from the lymphatic vessels. This sarcoma develops multicentrically in an edematous arm and spreads out rapidly, so prognosis is quite discouraging in those patients. They need to be radically surgically treated without hesitation; hence, amputation, not limb-saving surgery, should be indicated.\r"

Division of the right atrium (prominence of the eustachian and thebesian valves) is recognized pathologically, but is rare. It is unusual for this entity to be diagnosed during life. Stimulated by our experience with two patients seen at operation, one with an obstructive spinnaker-like formation and the other with a partitioned right atrium in the setting of pulmonary atresia, we reviewed the specimens in the heart museum of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh that had prominence of the eustachian and thebesian valves. We identified 14 such hearts, which could be divided into two groups. In the first group, comprising six hearts, the valves were prominent in the form of Chiari networks and were of no functional significance. The valves were more extensive in the other eight hearts and partitioned the right atrium. In two of these, the valves themselves were the impediment to flow through the right side of the heart. In the other six, there was either atresia or severe stenosis along the right-sided pathways so that, after birth, the prominent valves retained their role during fetal life; namely, to deflect inferior caval venous return across the atrial septum to the left atrium. The partitions in these latter hearts would be of functional significance only if it were necessary to perform a Fontan procedure, when they might obstruct flow through an atriopulmonary (or atrioventricular) anastomosis.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical pathologic features of the tricuspid valve were reviewed in 363 patients who had undergone tricuspid valve replacement at our institution during the period 1963 through 1987. Valves were purely regurgitant in 74%, stenotic and regurgitant in 23%, and purely stenotic in 2%; two valves were neither stenotic nor regurgitant. Among 269 purely insufficient tricuspid valves, the four most common causes were postinflammatory disease (41%), congenital disorder (32%), pulmonary venous hypertension (21%), and infective endocarditis (4%). Of 92 cases of tricuspid stenosis, with or without regurgitation, postinflammatory disease was observed in 92%. Female patients accounted for 66% of the 363 cases, including 84% of those with postinflammatory disease and 64% of those with pulmonary venous hypertension. In contrast, male patients accounted for 73% of cases with endocarditis and 61% with congenital heart disease. Although postinflammatory disease accounted for 53% of the 363 cases, its relative frequency diminished from 79% during 1963 through 1967 to only 24% during 1983 through 1987. This trend may reflect the decreasing incidence of acute rheumatic fever reported in Western countries. During the same time interval, the relative frequency of congenital heart disease as a cause of tricuspid dysfunction increased from 7% to 53%, and it is currently the most common cause in our surgical population. This finding apparently reflects changes in patient referral practices and the development of new operative procedures.\r"

HTLV-I is transmitted by sexual contact, from mother to child, by intravenous drug abuse, and by blood transfusion. The estimated lifetime risk of developing disease in antibody-positive patients is 1 in 80, and a latency period as long as 20 years can intervene. No case of transfusion-transmitted disease has been reported to date. Currently, no testing of blood donors for HTLV-I is required in the United States, and no such test has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Because data on the natural history of this virus may take years to accumulate, it is probably wise to begin excluding anti-HTLV-I-positive units from the blood supply in the United States as soon as a licensed test is available.\r"

In a double-blind crossover study, we compared the anti-Parkinson effects of standard Sinemet with a controlled-release formulation (Sinemet CR-4) in 23 patients with short-duration responses to standard Sinemet. With Sinemet CR-4, approximately half the patients who completed the study displayed a prolongation of their \"on\" response (optimal response to treatment), as assessed by monitoring individual drug-response cycles. A few patients experienced prolonged delays before the peak anti-Parkinson response developed to Sinemet CR-4. End-of-dose \"wearing off\" was favorably affected by Sinemet CR-4, but patients still had unpredictable \"off\" (parkinsonian) periods. Subjective ratings of Sinemet CR-4 varied, and 39% of patients who completed the study actually preferred standard Sinemet to the new formulation. We conclude that Sinemet CR-4 may benefit some patients with Parkinson's disease with a short-duration response to standard Sinemet; however, not all patients found it preferable to the standard formulation.\r"

Three cases are presented to illustrate the three types of acute interstitial nephritis--drug related, infection related, and idiopathic. Cell-mediated immune mechanisms seem to be more important than humorally mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of acute interstitial nephritis. Frequently, eosinophils are identified as a component of the interstitial cellular infiltrate, and eosinophiluria and eosinophilia have been claimed to be helpful in the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis, especially the drug-induced type. Neither eosinophiluria nor the presence of increased urinary levels of eosinophil major basic protein, however, is specific for the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis. Patients with drug-induced interstitial nephritis frequently have symptoms and signs suggestive of a hypersensitivity syndrome and rarely have more dramatic anaphylactic manifestations. Systemic glucocorticoids have been shown to be beneficial in this type of acute interstitial nephritis.\r"

Late potentials have been correlated with clinical ventricular tachycardia, are predictive of ventricular tachycardia inducibility at the time of electrophysiologic testing, and are predictive of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. In this review, we describe late potentials, the method of obtaining and processing the signal-averaged ECG, and clinical studies in various patient groups that have assessed the predictive value of the signal-averaged ECG for identification of patients at risk for subsequent ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Before any more progress is made in reducing the incidence of sudden cardiac death, our ability to identify those at risk must be refined further. The close association with coronary artery disease necessitates that the first step must be the identification of those with underlying coronary artery disease. This is underscored by the disturbing fact that, in many, sudden death is the first sign of coronary disease. An aggressive evaluation of those with significant risk factors appears justified. The second part of the problem is the identification of those with coronary artery disease who are at especially high risk. The current diagnostic modalities available suffer from a relative lack of specificity to be applied indiscriminately in light of the expense and morbidity of effective therapies (that is, coronary artery bypass surgery, antiarrhythmic drugs, implantable defibrillators, surgical or catheter ablation). At the present time, we can identify certain subsets that warrant aggressive therapy: survivors of sudden death events or sustained ventricular tachycardia, obstructive cardiomyopathies, aortic stenosis, left main coronary artery disease, and congenital QT prolongation. Less aggressive but also less specific therapies, such as beta-blockers in myocardial infarction survivors, can be given more indiscriminately. Ultimately, of course, the greatest impact will come from prevention of coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".U": "88317796\r", 
  ".W": "Silent myocardial ischemia is diagnosed by several different techniques and has been documented in all the anginal syndromes. In addition to other factors, its presence may be related to increased pain threshold and increased pain tolerance. Although some patients with painless ischemia may have less extensive coronary artery disease, cumulative evidence indicates that silent myocardial ischemia does not necessarily signify a lesser degree of cardiac ischemia or a less severe coronary abnormality. As judged by ambulatory monitoring studies, it shows circadian variation; occurs more frequently than symptomatic ischemia; and appears to depend, in large part, on activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Frequent silent ischemic events during ambulatory monitoring are worrisome because they reflect the disease \"activity\" of single or multiple coronary atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, there may be a direct association between the severity of ischemia seen during Holter monitoring, the extent of underlying coronary artery disease or disease activity, and prognosis. When diagnosed by exercise testing, silent myocardial ischemia may be associated with significant coronary involvement. In this regard, patients with three vessel coronary disease, impaired left ventricular function, and silent ischemia during stress testing should benefit from coronary revascularization. Compared with symptomatic patients, other evidence suggests that patients with exercise-induced asymptomatic ischemia have at least the same or perhaps even a worse outlook; this may be related to the lack of symptoms that would prompt evaluation and therapy. Awareness of the possibility of silent myocardial ischemia and use of commonly available tests, both to establish its presence and severity and to guide treatment, are emerging as new clinical goals. Further data, however, are necessary to determine how vigorously this should be pursued in different patient subgroups. In association with unstable angina or post-myocardial infarction, the added risk of silent myocardial ischemia warrants a more aggressive approach.\r"

  ".U": "88317798\r", 
  ".W": "In an immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates, it frequently is difficult to decide which invasive procedure, if any, to use to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Because most lung infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients are caused by bacteria and sputum usually is readily available for examination, empiric therapy with potent, safe, broad spectrum, antibacterial drugs often is successful. Invasive procedures that prove a diagnosis may result in substantive changes in therapy in perhaps as few as 10 to 20 per cent of patients, and the procedure itself may harm the patient. In a unique study in which patients with acute pneumonitis without neutropenia were randomized to either empiric antibiotic treatment or treatment based on results of open lung biopsy, patients with open lung biopsy had a worse outcome, possibly related to morbidity of open lung biopsy. Furthermore, no diagnoses were provided by open lung biopsy that were not treated by the empiric regimen. A missed treatable disease may be tragic, however. A thoughtful clinician must evaluate each patient with careful consideration of the history in light of the underlying disease and its treatment, rapidity of clinical course, physical examination, and laboratory data, particularly the chest radiograph, sputum examination, and bleeding parameters. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with washings and brushings is very safe; the addition of transbronchial biopsy adds diagnostic power at the price of some complications. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a very promising technique that probably will find widespread use. However, none of the foregoing techniques is completely sensitive. When no diagnosis is established and bronchoscopy studies are negative, open lung biopsy must be considered, especially when the chest radiograph or computed tomography scan suggests focal disease or lymphadenopathy. Needle aspiration can be used, particularly if local experience is favorable and lung disease is peripheral. When evaluating a procedure, local experience must be considered rather than reliance on published diagnostic yields and complication rates. New diagnostic and therapeutic developments may change decision analysis in the near future. At present, cultures for viruses and fungi and serologic techniques have little application at most medical centers, and decisions on data from invasive procedures pivot on interpretation of histology and smears. Development of assays for antigen (for example, Aspergillus) and rapid culture techniques (for example, cytomegalovirus and the shell vial method), coupled with new, effective antimicrobials, may demand maximum effort for a definitive diagnosis in every patient.\r"

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires demonstration of abnormally high and nonsuppressible values for aldosterone in plasma and urine and low plasma renin activity. Sophisticated biochemical profiling and localization procedures often are required to identify those subtypes that will benefit from surgical management, including aldosterone-producing adenomas, primary adrenal hyperplasia, unilateral hyperplasia, and aldosterone-producing renin responsive adenomas. Glucocorticoid-suppressible hyperaldosteronism and isolated aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma are rare additional subtypes to be identified.

Certain radiographic features, such as the distribution of opacities, hilar adenopathy, Kerley-B lines or pneumothorax, or pulmonary function tests demonstrating air flow limitation also narrow the differential diagnosis. One can direct the subsequent workup based on the narrowed differential diagnosis, the pace of disease, the activity of the ongoing inflammatory-immune process, and the age, overall medical condition, and wishes of the patient. Unless a specific diagnosis (for example, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the treatment of which is withdrawal of the offending agent) can be made, therapy of noninfectious diffuse lung disease is quite unsatisfactory. Immunosuppressive therapy is indicated to arrest the active inflammatory process with the hope that objective signs of improvement will occur after a 3- to 12-month course. Important areas of basic research in pulmonary fibrosis include cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the lung interstitium and delineation of fibroblast biology and cytokine-mediated lung connective tissue pathology. More successful therapies will probably evolve from better understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of the lung fibrogenic process.\r"

This failure may be because of the frequently obscure or nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation. Blood cultures as well as urine cultures may fail to identify correctly the bacterial pathogens responsible for the abscess. Perinephric abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with a urinary tract infection that fails to respond promptly to antibiotic therapy, particularly in those known to have anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract or diabetes mellitus. Consideration of this diagnosis should enter into the differential diagnosis of fever with abdominal pain or flank pain. Early recognition of perinephric abscess and prompt drainage, either percutaneously or surgically, in combination with appropriate antibiotic coverage, should reduce dramatically the morbidity and mortality from this infection.\r"

Labour was less often induced among screened women both for all reasons (5.9% vs 9.1%, p less than 0.0001) and for suspected post-term pregnancy (1.7% vs 3.7%, p less than 0.0001). Earlier detection of twins had no effect on neonatal outcome. Among babies born to screened women, fewer were of birthweight less than 2500 g (59 vs 95, p = 0.005) and mean birthweight was 42 g higher (p 0.008). For babies born to screened women who smoked it was 75 g higher (p 0.012) and for those of non-smokers 26 g (not significant). The reason for the differences in mean birthweight could be that screened women reduced smoking in response to watching their fetus on the scan.\r"

Patients were randomised into three groups. All were initially treated with cisplatin (100 mg/m2 x 5) after primary laparotomy. Group A (n = 53) was scheduled to have a second-look laparotomy, followed by cyclical oral chlorambucil. Group B (n = 56) was scheduled to have a second-look laparotomy, followed by total abdominal and pelvic irradiation, and group C (n = 57) received oral chlorambucil as for group A but had no second-look operation. With a median follow up of 46 months (range 21-64), no differences in survival were noted between the three groups. The median survival for group A was 21 months (95% CI 11-31 months), for group B 15 months (11-19), and for group C 17 months (8-26). Thus second-look laparotomy after completion of first-line single-agent cisplatin chemotherapy did not confer any survival benefit on patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Idiopathic or unexplained VT occurs in a small but important subset of patients without clinically evident heart disease. The majority of these patients appear to have a structurally normal heart. The cause of the arrhythmias in these individuals is unclear and may never be recognized. Other patients with this condition may have minor abnormalities not sufficient to impair overall cardiac function. The significance of these abnormalities to the genesis of the arrhythmia is uncertain. Whether patients with minor abnormalities are more likely to harbor covert heart disease such as myocarditis or a focal defect is not known, nor is it resolved whether such patients warrant a more aggressive search for a structural cause. The question that remains in any patient not subjected to surgical or pathological exploration is whether undetermined heart disease is responsible for the arrhythmia. Continued correlation between functional (electrophysiological) and structural (pathological) data will provide meaningful information concerning the pathophysiology (substrate) of these arrhythmias. Because of the preservation of normal cardiac function, these arrhythmias are generally well-tolerated. Although the condition is usually associated with a favorable prognosis, the occasional deaths reported in patients with apparently idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias may not permit calling this condition benign. It would be important to know the extent to which unrecognized abnormalities play a role in the genesis of these tachycardias, and whether such patients are more predisposed to fatal arrhythmias or have a different natural history. If cases involving undetermined or covert heart disease were excluded from consideration, then a relatively homogeneous disease-free group may be identified with a truly benign condition and a uniformly favorable prognosis. In these cases, a primary electrical abnormality may prove to be the basis for the arrhythmia. These issues remain to be elucidated in future studies.\r"

  ".W": "Mediastinal fibrosis, the most serious late complication of remote infection by Histoplasma capsulatum, is a thick, dense fibrotic capsule which surrounds a small mediastinal focus of old caseous adenitis. The fibrotic process may accrue over prolonged periods and extend within the lumina of critical mediastinal structures to produce complete occlusion. We summarized clinical and radiographic data for 71 patients with mediastinal fibrosis; the criteria for inclusion were the clinical demonstration of occlusion of major central airways (trachea or mainstem bronchus) or major vessels (pulmonary arteries or veins) and the absence of other disease processes which might cause such obstruction. We selected 65 patients who met these criteria from the medical literature of the last 40 years and report 6 new cases from our experience. The majority of patients were diagnosed between ages 20 and 40. The most common symptoms included hemoptysis, dyspnea, and cough. An accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound, wheezing, and localized murmur were among the physical findings reported. Radiographic abnormalities consisted of mass lesions and atelectasis or infiltrates, but were often nonspecific. Chest radiography was deceptively normal in some patients, even in the presence of major central airway or vascular occlusion, especially when the focus was subcarinal. Computed tomography has particular promise to depict the mediastinal abnormalities in this process. Surgery had minimal therapeutic benefit. Because of incomplete followup, the mortality of 30% in this series surely does not represent the true overall mortality of mediastinal fibrosis.\r"

  ".U": "88318806\r", 
  ".W": "An increase in the dose of chemotherapy enhances the response of many experimental and clinical cancers, but the extent of dose escalation is often limited by myelosuppression. In preliminary trials, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) has augmented leukocyte numbers and function, but the optimal dose is not established. We treated 16 adults who had inoperable or metastatic sarcomas with escalating doses of rhGM-CSF before and immediately after a first cycle of chemotherapy (cycle 1) to assess hematologic response and toxicity. A second cycle of chemotherapy (cycle 2) was given without rhGM-CSF. RhGM-CSF was tolerated well at doses of 4 to 32 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. At 64 micrograms per kilogram per day, edema and thrombi around a central venous catheter developed in two of four patients. Leukocyte and granulocyte counts increased significantly during the rhGM-CSF infusion. Neutropenia after cycle 1 was significantly less severe and shorter in duration than after cycle 2 (P less than 0.01). Mean total leukocyte and platelet nadirs were 1.0 and 101 x 10(9) per liter for cycle 1 and 0.45 and 44 x 10(9) per liter for cycle 2 (P less than 0.01), and the median intervals from day 1 of chemotherapy to neutrophil recovery (greater than 0.500 x 10(9) per liter) were 15 and 19 days, respectively (P less than 0.01). The duration of neutropenia was 3.5 days with cycle 1 and 7.4 days with cycle 2 (P less than 0.01). We conclude that rhGM-CSF is tolerated well at doses up to 32 micrograms per kilogram per day and is biologically active in leukopenic patients. It merits further evaluation for the prevention of morbidity from chemotherapy.\r"

Half the 20 immunosuppressed patients completing the one-year trial had satisfactory metabolic outcomes (hemoglobin A1c less than 6.8 percent; stimulated peak C peptide greater than 0.5 nmol per liter; insulin dose less than 0.4 U per kilogram of body weight per day) as compared with only 15 percent of the controls. Three of 20 immunosuppressed patients, but no controls, were insulin independent at one year. Two of these continue to receive azathioprine without insulin after more than 27 months of follow-up. The response to immunosuppression correlated with older age, better initial metabolic status, and lymphopenia (less than 1800 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter) resulting from immunosuppression. The side effects of azathioprine included vomiting in one patient and mild hair loss in several others. Prednisone use resulted in a transient cushingoid appearance, weight gain, and hyperglycemia. The growth rate remained normal in all patients. We conclude that early immunosuppression with short-term use of corticosteroids plus daily azathioprine can improve metabolic control in some patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, but results from this unblinded study are preliminary and require further confirmation and long-term follow-up.\r"

No currently available vaccine has demonstrated efficacy in preventing this disease in a controlled trial. We performed a placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized trial in a northern Thai province, with two doses of monovalent (Nakayama strain) or bivalent (Nakayama plus Beijing strains) inactivated, purified Japanese encephalitis vaccine made from whole virus derived from mouse brain. We examined the effect of these vaccines on the incidence and severity of Japanese encephalitis and dengue hemorrhagic fever, a disease caused by a closely related flavivirus. Between November 1984 and March 1985, 65,224 children received two doses of monovalent Japanese encephalitis vaccine (n = 21,628), bivalent Japanese encephalitis vaccine (n = 22,080), or tetanus toxoid placebo (n = 21,516), with only minor side effects. The cumulative attack rate for encephalitis due to Japanese encephalitis virus was 51 per 100,000 in the placebo group and 5 per 100,000 in each vaccine group. The efficacy in both vaccine groups combined was 91 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 70 to 97 percent). Attack rates for dengue hemorrhagic fever declined, but not significantly. The severity of cases of dengue was also reduced. We conclude that two doses of inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccine, either monovalent or bivalent, protect against encephalitis due to Japanese encephalitis virus and may have a limited beneficial effect on the severity of dengue hemorrhagic fever.\r"

Treatment began seven days before angioplasty and continued for six months afterward. All angiographic analyses were blinded and performed by a method that was validated by comparison with quantitative coronary angiography. In 82 male patients, 103 coronary lesions were dilated. Both groups had similar base-line clinical and angiographic characteristics. The incidence of early vessel restenosis, as determined on a second angiogram three to four months after angioplasty, was 36 percent in the control group and 16 percent in the treatment group (P = 0.026). The incidence of restenosis per patient was also significantly lower in the treatment group (46 vs. 19 percent). Both multiple logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel statistical analyses demonstrated a significant independent benefit of treatment with n-3 fatty acids. No important bleeding complications developed in the treated patients. These results, in a male population at relatively high risk for restenosis, suggest that a dietary supplement of n-3 fatty acids, administered for one week before and for six months after coronary angioplasty, is safe and reduces the occurrence of early restenosis after that procedure. Whether this beneficial effect also applies to other populations is unknown.\r"

The patients were randomly assigned to receive first one diet and then the other, each for 28 days, in a metabolic ward. In the high-carbohydrate diet, 25 percent of the energy was in the form of fat and 60 percent in the form of carbohydrates (47 percent of the total energy was in the form of complex carbohydrates); the high-monounsaturated-fat diet was 50 percent fat (33 percent of the total energy in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids) and 35 percent carbohydrates. The two diets had the same amounts of simple carbohydrates and fiber. As compared with the high-carbohydrate diet, the high-monounsaturated-fat diet resulted in lower mean plasma glucose levels and reduced insulin requirements, lower levels of plasma triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (lower by 25 and 35 percent, respectively; P less than 0.01), and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (higher by 13 percent; P less than 0.005). Levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol did not differ significantly in patients on the two diets. These preliminary results suggest that partial replacement of complex carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids in the diets of patients with NIDDM does not increase the level of LDL cholesterol and may improve glycemic control and the levels of plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol.\r"

  ".W": "The resource-based relative-value scale (RBRVS) is a measure of relative levels of resource input expended when physicians produce services and procedures. It is a function of the physician's work input, the opportunity cost of specialty training, and the relative practice costs for each specialty. This paper presents resource-based relative values (RBRVs) for selected procedures of four major specialties--family practice, internal medicine, general surgery, and thoracic and cardiovascular surgery. We compare RBRVs with current charges and find several general patterns. Invasive procedures are typically compensated at more than double the rate of evaluation-and-management services, when both consume the same resource inputs. Imaging and laboratory procedures fall between invasive and evaluation-and-management services. We analyze the financial implications of the RBRVS by developing a simple model and simulating the effects of an RBRVS-based fee schedule on physicians' revenues in various specialties. We use Medicare data to perform the simulation under the \"budget-neutral\" assumption. Results show that an RBRVS-based fee schedule affects specialties differently. The average family practitioner could receive 60 percent more revenue from Medicare, whereas the average ophthalmologist could lose 40 percent of current revenues. The effects on other specialties fall between these two.\r"

Recently, an activated S6 kinase (S6 K II) has been purified to homogeneity from Xenopus eggs, and characterized immunologically and at the molecular level. Purified S6 K II can be deactivated in vitro by incubation with either protein phosphatase 1 or protein phosphatase 2A. Reactivation and phosphorylation of S6 K II occurs in vitro with an insulin-stimulated microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) protein kinase which is itself a phosphoprotein that can be deactivated by protein phosphatase 2A. These studies suggest that a step in insulin signalling involves sequential activation by phosphorylation of at least two serine/threonine protein kinases.\r"

We report here the cloning and sequencing of a gene from Plasmodium falciparum, coding for a protein we call thrombospondin related anonymous protein (TRAP), which shares certain sequence motifs common to other well-characterized proteins. The most significant homology is based around the sequence Trp-Ser-Pro-Cys-Ser-Val-Thr-Cys-Gly (WSPCSVTCG), present in three copies in region I of thrombospondin (TSP), six copies in properdin (P) and one copy in all the circumsporozoite (CS) proteins sequenced so far. TRAP also shares with certain extracellular glycoproteins, including TSP, the cell-recognition signal Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), which has been shown to be crucial in the interaction of several extracellular glycoproteins with members of the integrin superfamily. Unlike the CS protein, TRAP is expressed during the erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle.\r"

  ".U": "88318954\r",

Unlike the classical pathway, which is initiated by interaction of C1q with the Fc regions of IgG or IgM antibodies in immune complexes, the alternative pathway can be directly activated via binding of C3b to surfaces of foreign organisms. The stabilized C3bnBbP complex activates components C3 and C5 resulting in opsonization of foreign material (via C3b) and assembly of the membrane attack complex (via C5b) on target cells. Therefore properdin greatly enhances complement-mediated clearance and inactivation mechanisms in both natural and acquired resistance to infection. This paper shows that the primary amino acid sequence of properdin is composed mainly of six repeating motifs, each of approximately 60 amino acids, and that similar sequences are found in thrombospondin, the circumsporozoite protein of malaria parasites and regions of the membrane-attack components of complement. These similarities may provide insight into the mechanisms by which parasites avoid host defences mediated by complement.\r"

A variety of mutations of the epidermal growth factor, insulin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (manuscript in preparation) receptors that have resulted in a loss of tyrosine kinase activity have produced a concomitant loss of growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis. Comparison of amino acid sequences of tyrosine kinases shows that these regions in the PDGF receptors in mouse and human contain an insert of unknown function. We have deleted this region, and expressed the altered form of the receptor in fibroblasts which lack PDGF receptors. This had no effect on a number of responses to PDGF, but cells bearing the mutant receptor did not proliferate or synthesize DNA in response to PDGF. This demonstrates that the insert is essential in PDGF-induced mitogenesis, and that PDGF stimulation of the mutant receptor tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol turnover are not sufficient to elicit a mitogenic response to PDGF.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma membrane-bound mammalian ras proteins of relative molecular mass 21,000 (ras p21) share biochemical and structural properties with other guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). Oncogenic ras p21 variants result from amino acid substitutions at specific positions that cause p21 to occur predominantly complexed to GTP in vivo. Recently, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) with cytosolic activity has been discovered that stimulates the GTPase activity of normal but not of oncogenic ras p21. GAP might be either a negative regulatory agent which acts further upstream in the regulatory pathway or the downstream target of ras p21. We have identified a protein from bovine brain with apparent relative molecular mass 125,000 that has GAP activity. Here, using pure GAP in a kinetic competition assay, we show that GAP interacts preferentially with the active GTP complexes of both normal and oncogenic Harvey (Ha) ras p21 compared with the inactive GDP complexes. We also report the cloning and sequencing of the complementary DNA for bovine GAP. Regions of GAP share amino acid similarity with the noncatalytic domain of adenylate cyclase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and with regions conserved between phospholipase C-148, the crk oncogene product and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases.\r"

  ".W": "The haploid genome of Caenorhabditis elegans consists of some 80 x 10(6) base pairs of DNA contained in six chromosomes. The large number of interesting loci that have been recognized by mutation, and the accuracy of the genetic map, mean that a physical map of the genome is highly desirable, because it will facilitate the molecular cloning of chosen loci. The first steps towards such a map used a fingerprinting method to link cosmid clones together. This approach reached its practical limit last year, when 90-95% of the genome had been cloned into 17,500 cosmids assembled into some 700 clusters (contigs), but the linking clones needed were either non-existent or extremely rare. Anticipating this, we had planned to link by physical means--probably by hybridization to NotI fragments separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis. NotI recognizes an eight base sequence of GC pairs; thus the fragments should be large enough to bridge regions that clone poorly in cosmids, and, with no selective step involved, would necessarily be fully representative. However, with the availability of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vector, we decided to use this alternative source of large DNA fragments to obtain linkage. The technique involves the ligation of large (50-1,000 kilobase) genomic fragments into a vector that provides centromeric, telomeric and selective functions; the constructs are then introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and replicate in the same manner as the host chromosomes.\r"

One class including epidermal growth factor, platelet derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor activates receptor tyrosine kinases, and the second class, including thrombin, bombesin, bradykinin and vasopressin activates a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C through GTP-binding proteins which can be inactivated by pertussis toxin. In Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, thrombin-induced mitogenicity seems to correlate well with phospholipase C activation and both events are sensitive to pertussis toxin. Thrombin, like the other mitogens in this class, simultaneously inhibits adenylate cyclase. This involves an inhibitory G protein (Gi), a well established pertussis toxin substrate. The relative contributions of the two signalling pathways to mitogenicity has not been evaluated so far. We report here that the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), a contracting agent and mitogen for smooth muscle cells, activates phospholipase C, inhibits adenylate cyclase and stimulates DNA synthesis in fibroblasts. These events are sensitive to pertussis toxin. We show that the mitogenicity of 5-hydroxytryptamine can be uncoupled from phospholipase C activation that is mediated by 5-HT2 receptors, but correlates perfectly with inhibition of adenylate cyclase through 5-HT1B receptor. We propose that inhibition of adenylate cyclase or activation of an undefined effector system by Gi is important in 5-hydroxytryptamine induced DNA synthesis and contributes to the strong mitogenicity of the other members of this family of growth factors.\r"

Immunostaining was localized in orderly arrays of stacked parallel cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum in the perikaryon and dendritic processes.

A tarsal Muller's muscle resection is employed in cases where the ptosis is minimal, the upper eyelid crease is normal, or the phenylephrine test is positive. A levator advancement is done if the ptosis is due to a levator aponeurosis dehiscence or attenuation with a higher than normal upper eyelid crease and thinning of the eyelid. Both procedures are easily combined with an upper eyelid blepharoplasty.\r"

Treatment of these patients is aimed at improving their quality of life and helping their families provide supportive care. About 15% of patients with dementia can be successfully treated. A detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, and appropriate laboratory testing are important to identify the treatable causes of dementia, such as normal-pressure hydrocephalus, Korsakoff's psychosis, and drug toxicity.\r"

To investigate this hypothesis, the normal and the transforming Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras genes were each transfected into Rat-1 fibroblasts under the control of strong promoters. Several cell lines, both normal and transformed, were selected that expressed high levels of p21ras. Phosphatidylinositol turnover was measured in these cells in response to a wide variety of peptide factors; bradykinin was found to have a greatly enhanced effect on the p21ras overexpressors relative to the parental and control cells. Bradykinin receptor numbers were measured in these lines and found to be up to 40-fold higher in the p21ras overexpressors than in the parental cells. This was found to be the case for both normal and transforming forms of all three varieties of ras genes. Receptor number correlated well with the bradykinin-dependent phosphatidylinositol turnover response in all cases. These data indicate that the effects of p21ras on cellular responses to the peptide hormone bradykinin are due to changes in receptor number rather than to direct coupling by p21ras between the receptor and phospholipase C.\r"

  ".W": "The role of ras-encoded proteins and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in inositol phospholipid metabolism has been studied. PDGF stimulates inositol phospholipid turnover in confluent normal rat kidney (NRK) cells and enhances hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate in NRK cell membranes in the presence of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. The stimulatory effect of PDGF on phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis is not inhibited by pretreatment of NRK cells with pertussis toxin, implying that PDGF-stimulated phospholipase C activity of NRK cells is regulated by a pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) that is different from Gi (inhibitory G protein) or Go (G protein of unknown function). When bacterially made human normal or oncogenic T24 ras protein is added to 32P-labeled NRK cell membranes in the presence of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, normal ras protein increases by 3-fold the formation of inositol trisphosphate, whereas T24 ras protein has no significant effect. In addition, normal ras protein and PDGF have additive effects on inositol trisphosphate production. Taken together, these data suggest that normal ras protein stimulates inositol phospholipid turnover in NRK cells by means of a pathway different from the PDGF-regulated one and that oncogenic ras protein is without significant stimulatory effect in this action.\r"

C., Weinberger, C., Lebo, R. & Evans, R. M. (1987) Science 237, 1610-1614] in the putative DNA binding domain and in the first 180 amino acids of the hormone binding domain but no similarity except for 5 amino acids at the extreme 3' end. Isolation and sequencing of the 3' end of the gene coding for rTR alpha, vI and vII mRNAs revealed that the 3' heterogeneity is due to alternative splicing of the primary transcripts of the same gene. RNA transfer blot analyses with probes unique to rTR alpha, rTR alpha vI, and rTR alpha vII showed that only the variant mRNAs are abundantly expressed in rat brain, contrary to the previously reported high-level expression of rTR alpha. Since in vitro translation products of rTR alpha vI and rTR alpha vII did not bind thyroid hormones specifically, our findings explain the discrepancy between the reported abundance of the receptor mRNA and the low receptor levels determined by ligand binding studies in rat brain. These variant mRNAs are also expressed in kidney, heart, spleen, and liver, albeit at lower levels. The presence of an intact DNA binding domain in rTR alpha vI and rTR alpha vII suggests that the variants might have modulating functions in thyroid hormone action.\r"

Thus, the expression from a single cell reflects the activity of single active transcription templates. Under these conditions, a vector encoding the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40 T-Ag) driven by the SV40 enhancer and early promoter was transfected into CV-1, L, or HeLa cells yielding, for all three cell types, about 10-30% T-Ag-positive cells as assayed by immunofluorescence. Similar vectors containing either mutated or deleted SV40 enhancers also gave T-Ag-positive cells, but at about 1/100 the frequency. Quantitative analysis showed that T-Ag-positive cells produced about the same amount of T-Ag whether or not an active enhancer was present. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-encoding vectors gave the same result. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that at a low, but finite, probability, fully functional transcription complexes can form on a given active template in the absence of enhancer DNA. Enhancers seem to increase the number of active templates. Subcloning experiments suggest that these transcription complexes can be surprisingly stable.\r"

  ".W": "The three-dimensional structures of the carboxyl-terminal regions of the P21 protein products of the human Harvey (Ha), Kirsten (KiA and KiB), and neuroblastoma (N) RAS oncogenes and various mutants have been determined by using conformational energy analysis. The carboxyl-terminal region of P21 has been strongly implicated in the binding of the protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane without which the protein is inactive. The only invariant residue in this region is Cys-186, which is necessary for the post-translational addition of palmitic acid. The surrounding sequences of the active native proteins differ considerably. Nevertheless, certain amino acid substitutions in this region are known to eliminate membrane binding and protein activity, suggesting that there is a conserved common structural feature in this region in the native proteins that is disrupted in the mutant proteins. Conformational energy analysis shows that the four native P21 proteins have a common structure in the form of an alpha-helix for the terminal pentapeptide. A mutant, pBW277, that fails to bind to the membrane and is inactive cannot adopt an alpha-helical structure in this region because of a proline at position 188. Another mutant, pBW766, that retains membrane binding and activity, on the other hand, retains the preference for an alpha-helical conformation in the terminal pentapeptide. These findings suggest that, despite various amino acid sequences in this region, the carboxyl-terminal pentapeptides of the P21 proteins form a distinctive structural domain that must have an alpha-helical structure for membrane binding and intracellular activity.\r"

  ".W": "A biosynthetic antibody binding site, which incorporated the variable domains of anti-digoxin monoclonal antibody 26-10 in a single polypeptide chain (Mr = 26,354), was produced in Escherichia coli by protein engineering. This variable region fragment (Fv) analogue comprised the 26-10 heavy- and light-chain variable regions (VH and VL) connected by a 15-amino acid linker to form a single-chain Fv (sFv). The sFv was designed as a prolyl-VH-(linker)-VL sequence of 248 amino acids. A 744-base-pair DNA sequence corresponding to this sFv protein was derived by using an E. coli codon preference, and the sFv gene was assembled starting from synthetic oligonucleotides. The sFv polypeptide was expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli, using a leader derived from the trp LE sequence. The sFv protein was obtained by acid cleavage of the unique Asp-Pro peptide bond engineered at the junction of leader and sFv in the fusion protein [(leader)-Asp-Pro-VH-(linker)-VL]. After isolation and renaturation, folded sFv displayed specificity for digoxin and related cardiac glycosides similar to that of natural 26-10 Fab fragments. Binding between affinity-purified sFv and digoxin exhibited an association constant [Ka = (3.2 +/- 0.9) x 10(7) M-1] that was about a factor of 6 smaller than that found for 26-10 Fab fragments [Ka = (1.9 +/- 0.2) x 10(8) M-1] under the same buffer conditions, consisting of 0.01 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5/0.25 M urea.\r"

  ".W": "A chimeric gene specifying the 308 N-terminal amino acids of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the human c-fms protooncogene joined to the remainder of the feline v-fms oncogene product encodes a functional colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor. When expressed in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the chimeric gene product was rapidly transported to the cell surface, was autophosphorylated on tyrosine only in response to human recombinant CSF-1, underwent ligand-induced but not phorbol ester-induced down-modulation, and stimulated CSF-1-dependent cell proliferation. By contrast, the C-terminally truncated glycoprotein encoded by the v-fms oncogene is partially inhibited in its transport to the plasma membrane, is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine, and is relatively refractory to both ligand-induced and phorbol ester-induced down-modulation. Although the v-fms oncogene can transform cells in the absence of CSF-1, its tyrosine kinase activity and turnover can be appropriately regulated by the human c-fms-encoded ligand binding domain. The results confirm that C-terminal truncation of the c-fms gene is insufficient to activate its transforming potential and suggest that an additional mutation in its distal extracellular domain is required for oncogenic activation.\r"

The 1246-3A cell line, which can proliferate in the absence of exogenous insulin, produces in its conditioned medium a growth factor similar to pancreatic insulin by its biological and immunological properties. This factor, called \"insulin-related factor\" (IRF), was purified and iodinated to study its binding to cell surface receptors. 125I-labeled IRF binding to intact 1246-3A cells is lower than to 1246 cells. Cell surface binding can be restored by culturing the 1246-3A cells in the presence of an anti-porcine insulin monoclonal antibody or by acid prewash of the cells prior to performing the binding. Scatchard analysis of binding indicates that IRF secreted by the 1246-3A cells partially occupies high-affinity binding sites on the producer cells. Moreover, insulin monoclonal antibody inhibits the proliferation of the IRF-producing 1246-3A cells, suggesting that these cells are dependent on the secreted IRF for growth in culture. We conclude that the insulin-related factor secreted by the insulin-independent 1246-3A cells stimulates their proliferation in an autocrine fashion.\r"

  ".W": "The role of lipids in Plasmodium falciparum invasion of erythrocytes was investigated by biochemical and fluorescent microscopic analysis. Metabolic incorporation of radioactive oleate or palmitate and fractionation of radiolabeled phospholipids by thin-layer chromatography revealed no difference in the major phospholipid classes of schizonts and early ring forms after merozoite invasion. Fluorescent anthroyloxy derivatives of oleate and palmitate were also metabolically incorporated into parasite phospholipids. By microscopic analysis, the fluorescent phospholipids were seen localized in the plasma membrane and, within the merozoite, concentrated near the apical end. During invasion fluorescent phospholipid appeared to be injected from the apical end of the merozoite into the host membrane, both within and outside the parasite-host membrane junctions. After invasion fluorescent lipid was only found in the parasite plasma membrane and/or parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Parallel experiments with a fluorescent cholesterol derivative, incorporated into parasite membranes by exchange, revealed neither heterogeneous distribution of label within the parasite nor evidence for cholesterol transfer from merozoite to host cell membrane. Results suggest that during invasion no major covalent alteration of parasite lipids, such as lysophospholipid formation, occurs. However, invasion and formation of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane apparently involves insertion of parasite phospholipids into the host membrane.\r"

MAK16-LacZ fusion proteins that include one of these putative signals entered the nucleus, while unfused beta-galactosidase did not, as judged by subcellular fractionation experiments. In the C-terminal third of the MAK16 open reading frame is an acidic region in which 25 of 41 residues are either glutamate or aspartate.

Recombination between the end of the linear molecules and homologous chromosomal sequences gives rise to chromosome fragments comprising all sequences distal or proximal to the mapping site depending on the orientation of the cloned DNA. The recombinant products are recovered by screening for stabilization of a suppressor tRNA on the linear molecules using a colony color assay. The cloned DNA is positioned relative to the chromosome ends by sizing the chromosomal fragments using alternating contour-clamped homogeneous electric field gel electrophoresis. Application of this technique to organisms other than S. cerevisiae and to the analysis of exogenous DNA cloned in yeast is discussed.\r"

Dextran sulfate (Mr 5000) and heparin (Mr 15,000) completely protected MT-4 cells against HIV-1-induced cytopathogenicity at a concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. Their 50% inhibitory concentrations were 9.1 micrograms/ml (dextran sulfate) and 7.0 micrograms/ml (heparin), respectively. No toxicity for the host cells was observed with these compounds at a concentration of 625 micrograms/ml. The anti-HIV-1 activity of heparins of various molecular weights correlated well with their anticoagulant activity. On the other hand, with dextran sulfates of low molecular weight (5000, 8000) a significant inhibitory effect on HIV-1 was achieved at a concentration that was not markedly inhibitory to the blood coagulation process. Dextran sulfate and heparin were not inhibitory to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase unless they were used at concentrations in excess of those that inhibited HIV-1 replication. They were highly effective against HIV-1 replication even when present only during the 2-hr virus adsorption period. Studies using radiolabeled HIV-1 virions indicated that dextran sulfate and heparin inhibit virus adsorption to the host cells.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple i.p. injections of low-dose streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) produce insulitis, beta cell destruction, and diabetes in male CD-1 mice. Recent data also suggest that macrophages figure in the low-dose streptozotocin model. Because other recent studies have shown that essential fatty acid deficiency prevents autoimmune nephritis in mice, decreases the number of resident Ia-positive glomerular macrophages, and decreases the elicitation of macrophages into the glomerulus in inflammation, we examined the effect of essential fatty acid deficiency on the incidence and severity of insulitis and diabetes in CD-1 mice treated with low-dose streptozotocin. Streptozotocin-treated mice on the control diet uniformly developed diabetes (19/19). Essential fatty acid-deficient mice treated with streptozotocin did not develop diabetes (1/13). Mean plasma glucose levels for the control and essential fatty acid-deficient mice were 384.5 +/- 23.6 and 129.1 +/- 15.5 mg/dl, respectively, at the end of 1 month. To discern whether essential fatty acid deficiency prevented the streptozotocin-induced beta cell injury or the inflammatory response to injured beta cells, mice were repleted with daily injections of 99% pure methyl linoleate beginning 3 days after the last streptozotocin injection. These mice also quickly developed severe (3/4) or mild (1/4) diabetes. Histologic examination of the pancreata of control mice or repleted mice showed marked insulitis and beta cell destruction; in contrast, the pancreata of essential fatty acid-deficient mice showed preservation of beta cells and only focal mild peri-insulitis. Essential fatty acid deficiency thus prevents the insulitis and resultant diabetes in low-dose streptozotocin-treated CD-1 mice, suggesting a central role for macrophages and lipid mediators in this autoimmunity model.\r"

  ".U": "88320407\r", 
  ".W": "Xenopus oocytes were used to study the interaction of neuronal quisqualate receptors with neuronal ion channels. Total mRNA was isolated from chick forebrain and injected into Xenopus oocytes. This technique led to the expression of functional voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels, of ligand-gated gamma-aminobutyrate and kainate receptor channels, and of quisqualate receptors that could activate endogenous chloride channels by means of inositol trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release. Exposure of the oocytes to quisqualate decreased the amplitude of the Na+ current and of the gamma-aminobutyrate type A-gated current and increased the amplitude of the Ba2+ current through Ca2+ channels. This modulation of neuronal ion channels by quisqualate could be mimicked by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the diacylglycerol analogue 1,2-oleoylacetylglycerol. The kainate-gated channel was not affected by these agents. Phorbol esters that do not activate protein kinase C, alpha-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and alpha-phorbol, were without effect. The inhibitor of protein kinase C, tamoxifen, prevented the modulatory effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The present evidence suggests that the activity of the neuronal Na+ and Ca2+ channels and the ligand-gated gamma-aminobutyrate type A receptor channel are under the control of protein kinase C and that neurotransmitters that activate protein kinase C could profoundly affect neuronal signaling.\r"

Escherichia coli YK537 strain harboring plasmid pTA1522, which has the phoA promoter-phoA signal peptide-hEGF gene, was used. Cells were cultured first in high-phosphate medium and then, for induction of the hEGF-encoding gene, transferred to low-phosphate medium containing Ahx (0.25 mg/ml). hEGF and Ahx-substituted hEGF, [Ahx21]hEGF, secreted into the periplasm were recovered. After treatment with H2O2, [Ahx21]-hEGF was clearly separated from methionine-oxidized hEGF by one-step reverse-phase HPLC. Substitution of the methionine residue of hEGF with Ahx was confirmed by the amino acid analysis of [Ahx21]hEGF. The three biological activities of [Ahx21]hEGF were the same as those of hEGF. From the successful production of [Ahx21]hEGF, a basic strategy was established for preparing proteins substituted with nonprotein amino acid (alloprotein). Induction of the phoA promoter of pho regulon and secretion of the product to the periplasm may depress heat shock-like responses and subsequent hydrolysis of the product by cytoplasmic protease.\r"

Phage f1 poorly infects bacterial strains lacking IHF because IHF is required for efficient expression of F-pili, the receptor for f1 phage. However, when F- strains are transfected with f1 DNA the phage replicates in IHF mutants (himA, himD, or himA himD) at a rate of only 3% of that in wild-type bacteria. A plasmid dependent on the f1 replicon fails to transform IHF mutants. By gel retardation analysis, we show that IHF specifically binds to the origin of replication. DNase I \"footprinting\" experiments demonstrate that IHF binds to multiple sites within the replication enhancer sequence, a cis-acting, A + T-rich sequence that potentiates f1 DNA replication. Moreover, the effect of IHF mutation on f1 growth is suppressed by initiator protein (f1 gene II) mutations that restore efficient replication from origins that lack a functional replication enhancer sequence. This genetic evidence supports the conclusion that the replication enhancer sequence is the site of action of IHF.\r"

A series of yeast expression plasmids was constructed in which segments of the cDNA sequences encoding Drosophila DNA topoisomerase II were inserted under the transcriptional control of yeast GAL1 promoter. Expression of the functional form of Drosophila topoisomerase II cDNA can complement conditionally lethal, temperature-sensitive mutations in the yeast topoisomerase II gene (TOP2), as well as mutations in which the TOP2 locus was disrupted. The survival of these yeast cells depends upon the continuous expression of Drosophila topoisomerase II. Repression of Drosophila gene expression by glucose causes these yeast cells to cease dividing after a few generations. In addition to these genetic complementation data, the expression of the Drosophila topoisomerase II gene in yeast cells with a disruption in TOP2 can also be detected by immunochemical methods with an antibody specific for Drosophila topoisomerase II.\r"

The gene is expressed during the erythrocytic stage in both asexual and sexual parasites (RNA blot analysis) and a 72-kDa protein is immunoprecipitated from erythrocytic stage parasites. Importantly, the sequence of the clone is similar to the canonical sequence at the carboxyl termini of glucose-regulated proteins of mammals that determines their localization within endoplasmic reticulum. Since the parasite sequence has only three (Asp-Glu-Leu) of the four carboxyl-terminal amino acids, its location and its function within the parasite remain to be determined.\r"

Malignant transformation of these cells is demonstrated by their ability to form carcinomas when grafted back onto syngeneic animals. However, expression of the malignant phenotype by the ras-transformed keratinocytes is drastically inhibited by the presence of normal dermal fibroblasts. This inhibitory effect depends on the ratio of fibroblasts to keratinocytes. It can be observed with mitomycin C-treated growth-arrested dermal fibroblasts and not with other cells, such as normal keratinocytes or established fibroblasts. Thus, a cellular environment approximating normal tissue can suppress tumor formation triggered by a single oncogene.\r"

These mRNAs, as well as synthetic polynucleotides, phage MS2 RNA, and a deoxyoctanucleotide complementary to the 3' end of 16S rRNA were used to study the mechanism of translation initiation in vitro. Escherichia coli 30S ribosomal subunits interact with all these nucleic acids, albeit with different affinities; the affinity for the mRNA with the SD sequence (Ka approximately 2 x 10(7) M-1) is more than an order of magnitude higher than that for the mRNA lacking this sequence. The initiation factors are equally required, regardless of the presence of the SD sequence, for 30S and 70S initiation complex formation and for mRNA translation, but the initiation factors do not affect the SD interaction or the binding of the mRNAs to the ribosomes. The SD interaction is also mechanistically irrelevant for 30S initiation complex formation and is not essential for translation in vitro or for the selection of the mRNA reading frame. It is suggested that the function of the SD interaction is to ensure a high concentration of the initiation triplet near the ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA binding site, whereas the selection of the translational start is achieved kinetically, under the influence of the initiation factors, during decoding of the initiator tRNA.\r"

We describe here a derivative of the bacterial transposon Tn5 called Tn5tac1 and its use in an innovative strategy for making mutations with conditional phenotypes.

Our results show that two unusual conditional mutant phenotypes can result from Tn5tac1 insertion in Escherichia coli: one is corrected by IPTG while the other is induced by IPTG. The broad host range of Tn5 and the conditional nature of these mutant phenotypes makes Tn5tac1 well suited for identifying essential genes in diverse bacterial species.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of ligand to B-cell membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) can lead to activation of a number of distinct biologic responses, including altered expression of genes encoding c-fos, c-myc, and Ia, as well as proliferation and immunologic tolerance. Tolerance could reflect a functional uncoupling of receptors from systems that generate intracellular second messengers (i.e., receptor desensitization). To better understand the molecular basis of immune regulation, we examined the ability of mIg to function as a signal transducer after the cell's initial contact with mIg-binding ligand. The results show that ligand binding to as little as 2-10% of mIgM or mIgD renders the cell unresponsive to ligand binding to the reciprocal isotype as judged by Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C translocation responses. This heterologous receptor desensitization lasts longer than 24 hr and does not reflect loss of receptor from the cell surface. Studies with the calcium ionophore ionomycin, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, and the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine indicate that both protein kinase C-dependent and protein kinase C-independent (staurosporine-insensitive) mechanisms mediate heterologous desensitization after mIg crosslinking.\r"

Although lymphocytes cultured with env-gag peptides produced significant amounts of IgG, addition of env-gag peptides to a pokeweed mitogen-induced B-cell activation system resulted in suppression of immunoglobulin synthesis by normal lymphocytes. Recombinant antigens, env-gag and env-80 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), produced a substantial proliferative response by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. PBMC precultured with HIV synthetic peptide env 578-608 also manifested significant proliferative responses as compared to control cultures. CD3+ lymphocytes precultured with recombinant HIV antigens, env-gag and env-80 DHFR, and synthetic HIV peptide, env 487-511, showed moderate but significant proliferative responses. Both recombinant antigens and synthetic peptides also produced a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on proliferation by CD3- lymphocytes. Stimulation of CD3+ and CD3- lymphocyte subpopulations induced by env-gag peptides was specifically inhibited by goat anti-env-gag polyclonal antibodies, demonstrating the specificity of the reaction. These studies demonstrate that recombinant and synthetic peptides of the HIV genome express immunoregulatory T- and B-cell epitopes. Identification of unique HIV epitopes with immunogenic and immunoregulatory activities is necessary for the development of an effective vaccine against HIV infection.\r"

Tiazofurin-mediated cell differentiation is a multistep process. The inducer initiates early (less than 6 hr) metabolic changes that precede commitment to differentiation; among these early changes are decreases in IMP dehydrogenase activity and in GTP concentration, as well as alterations in the expression of certain protooncogenes (c-Ki-ras). K-562 cells do express commitment-i.e., cells exhibit differentiation without tiazofurin. Guanosine was effective in preventing the action of tiazofurin, thus providing evidence that the guanine nucleotides are critically involved in tiazofurin-initiated differentiation. Activation of transcription of the erythroid-specific gene that encodes A gamma-globin is a late (48 hr) but striking effect of tiazofurin. Down-regulation of the c-ras gene appears to be part of the complex process associated with tiazofurin-induced erythroid differentiation and relates to the perturbations of GTP metabolism.\r"

Here we present evidence that 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl KYNA) inhibits N-Me-D-Asp responses by a selective antagonism of glycine at this modulatory site. In rat cortical slices 7-Cl KYNA (10-100 microM) noncompetitively inhibited N-Me-D-Asp responses, and this effect could be reversed by the addition of glycine (100 microM) or D-serine (100 microM). Radioligand binding experiments showed that 7-Cl KYNA had a much higher affinity for the strychnine-insensitive [3H]glycine binding site (IC50 = 0.56 microM) than for the N-Me-D-Asp (IC50 169 microM), quisqualate (IC50 = 153 microM), or kainate (IC50 greater than 1000 microM) recognition sites. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from rat cortical neurones in culture, the inhibitory effects of 7-Cl KYNA on N-Me-D-Asp-induced currents could not be overcome by increasing the N-Me-D-Asp concentration but could be reversed by increasing the glycine concentration. 7-Cl KYNA could completely abolish N-Me-D-Asp responses, including basal responses in the absence of added glycine, suggesting that it may possess negative modulatory effects at the glycine site. These findings indicate that the glycine modulatory site is functional in intact adult tissue and that 7-Cl KYNA should prove to be a selective tool for elucidating the involvement of this site in physiological and pathological events mediated by N-Me-D-Asp receptors.\r"

  ".W": "It is widely held that a glutamate-like toxin that resembles N-methyl-D-aspartate may be responsible for the death of nerve cells seen after severe neurological insults including stroke, seizures, and degenerative disorders, such as Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonism-dementia complex found on Guam. One puzzling fact about these maladies is the differential vulnerability of specific groups of neurons peculiar to each condition. We report here that an identified population of central neurons, rat retinal ganglion cells, are resistant to the neurotoxic effects of millimolar concentrations of glutamate under otherwise normal culture conditions. Patch-clamp experiments show that this resistance is associated with a very small ionic current response to N-methyl-D-aspartate. Varying the ionic milieu by increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, however, results in a striking increase in glutamate-induced cell death in this population. Under these conditions, Mg2+ or the amino acid antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-(alpha,gamma)-cyclohepten-5 ,10-imine maleate], blockers of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-coupled ion channels, completely abrogate the lethal effects of glutamate. These findings strongly suggest that Ca2+ entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate-activated channels is responsible for this type of neuronal death and suggest strategies that may be clinically useful in the treatment of various neurological disorders.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single rat anterior pituitary gonadotropes identified by a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Concentrations of GnRH greater than 10 pM elicited increases in [Ca2+]i in identified cells but not in others. In contrast, depolarization induced by 50 mM K+ increased [Ca2+]i in all cells. Ca2+ transients induced by GnRH exhibited a complex time course. After an initial rapid rise, the [Ca2+]i fell to near basal levels only to be followed by a secondary extended rise and fall. Analysis of the Ca2+ transients on a rapid time base revealed that responses frequently consisted of several rapid oscillations in [Ca2+]i. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or addition of the dihydropyridine Ca2+-channel blocker nitrendipine completely blocked the secondary rise in [Ca2+]i but had no effect whatsoever on the initial spike. Nitrendipine also blocked 50 mM K+-induced increases in [Ca2+]i in identified gonadotropes. The secondary rise induced by GnRH could be enhanced by a phorbol ester in a nitrendipine-sensitive fashion. Multiple spike responses to GnRH stimulation of the same cell could only be obtained if subsequent Ca2+ influx was permitted either by allowing a secondary rise to occur or by producing a Ca2+ transient by depolarizing the cells with 50 mM K+. It therefore appears that the response to GnRH consists of an initial phase of Ca2+ mobilization, probably mediated by inositol trisphosphate, and a subsequent phase of Ca2+ influx through nitrendipine-sensitive Ca2+ channels that may be activated by protein kinase C. The relative roles of these phases in the control of gonadotropin secretion are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A mutation partially suppressing the UV sensitivity caused by recF143 in a uvrA6 background was located at codon 37 of recA where GTG (valine) became ATG (methionine). This mutation, originally named srf-803, was renamed recA803. Little if any suppression of the recF143 defect in UV induction of a lexA regulon promoter was detected. This led to the hypothesis that a defect in recombination repair of UV damage was suppressed by recA803. The mutant RecA protein (RecA803) was purified and compared with wild-type protein (RecA+) as a catalyst of formation of joint molecules. Under suboptimal conditions, RecA803 produces both a higher rate of formation and a higher yield of joint molecules. The suboptimal conditions tested included addition of single-stranded DNA binding protein to single-stranded DNA prior to addition of RecA. We hypothesize that the ability of RecA803 to overcome interference by single-stranded DNA binding protein is the property that allows recA803 to suppress partially the deficiency in repair caused by recF mutations in the uvrA6 background. Implications of this hypothesis for the function of RecF protein in recombination are discussed.\r"

The protein was efficiently expressed (i) as a fusion protein that starts at the T7 major capsid protein initiation site in a pET expression vector and (ii) as a protein that starts within the bisphosphatase sequence by translation reinitiation. Both proteins have similar properties. The protein was purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The purified fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain was active and no 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity was found associated with it. In contrast to the dimeric bifunctional enzyme, the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain behaved as a monomer of 30 kDa. The turnover number and kinetic properties of the separate bisphosphatase domain were similar to those of the bisphosphatase of the bifunctional enzyme, including the ability to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate. These results support the hypothesis that the rat liver enzyme consists of two independent domains and is a member of a class of enzymes formed by gene fusion.\r"

When a genomic DNA fragment containing the coding and upstream regulatory regions of the human insulin gene was stably transfected into MSL-G2 cells no measurable amounts of insulin or insulin mRNA were detected in vitro. However, successive transplantation of two transfected clones resulted in hypoglycemic tumors that efficiently coexpressed human and rat insulin as determined by human C-peptide-specific immunoreagents. These results demonstrate that cis-acting tissue-specific insulin gene enhancer elements are conserved between rat and human insulin genes. We propose that the in vivo differentiation of MSL-G2 cells and transfected subclones into insulin-producing cells reflects processes of natural beta-cell ontogeny leading to insulin gene expression.\r"

Two observations indicated that this factor is E. coli integration host factor (IHF): purified IHF substituted specifically for host factor from a crude lysate, and lysates prepared from cells deficient in the beta subunit of IHF (E. coli hip mutants; also called himD) contained no host factor activity. Binding studies in vitro and competition experiments in vivo suggest that two types of ParB-parS DNA complexes can exist that differ in (i) the presence of IHF, (ii) the amount of parS sequence with which the proteins interact, and (iii) the specificity of their participation in partition. Under normal conditions, with the intact P1 partition region and wild-type bacteria, P1 plasmids apparently use IHF to assist ParB in the assembly of a functional partition complex at parS.\r"

  ".U": "88320506\r", 
  ".W": "The hallmark of \"beta 2-interferon (IFN-beta 2)/hepatocyte-stimulating factor/interleukin 6\" gene expression is its inducibility in different types of human cells (fibroblasts, monocytes, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells) by different stimuli, which include cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 (IL-1) and platelet-derived growth factor, different viruses, and bacterial products such as endotoxin. The activation by cytokines, viruses, and second messenger agonists of the IFN-beta 2 promoter linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was studied after transfection into HeLa cells. A chimeric gene containing IFN-beta 2 DNA from -1180 to +13 linked to the CAT gene was inducible approximately 10-fold by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), followed, in decreasing order, by pseudorabies and Sendai viruses (7- to 11-fold each); serum (6- to 9-fold); the cytokines tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and epidermal growth factor (3- to 5-fold each); the cAMP agonists BrcAMP and forskolin and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (2- to 6-fold each); poly(I).poly(C) (2- to 4-fold); 1,2-diacylglycerol and the calcium ionophore A23187 (1.5- to 2-fold each). Bacterial endotoxin did not activate this IFN-beta 2/CAT fusion gene in HeLa cells. Deletion of the 5' boundary of the IFN-beta 2 DNA from -1180 to -596 in the fusion gene preserved its activation by IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, epidermal growth factor, serum, pseudorabies, and Sendai viruses and by PMA, Br-cAMP, and forskolin; deletion to -225 led to a small reduction (by a factor of 1.5-2) in the responsiveness to serum, PMA, and Sendai virus but not to the other inducers; a further deletion to -112 greatly reduced all responsiveness. Thus, the region between -225 and -113 in IFN-beta 2, which contains DNA motifs similar to the regulatory elements in the human c-fos gene, appears to contain the major cis-acting regulatory elements responsible for the activation of the IFN-beta 2 promoter by several different cytokines, viruses, and second messenger agonists.\r"

The affinity-purified alpha and beta anti-peptide antibodies interacted specifically with tubulin and with the respective peptide antigens but did not interact with MAPs. Substoichiometric amounts of both antibodies showed the capacity to inhibit in vitro MAP-induced tubulin assembly and to promote a fast depolymerization of preassembled microtubules. Taxol-promoted assembly of pure tubulin was not inhibited by the antibodies. In the presence of MAP-2 and taxol, the antibodies decreased the MAP-2 content of taxol-promoted microtubules. The interaction with microtubules was corroborated by immunofluorescence experiments in HeLa and NE-18 lung carcinoma cells.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF), which does not cause the morphological differentiation of PC12 cells that is produced by NGF, also induces protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. The methyltransferase inhibitor, 5'-methylthioadenosine, which is known to block the NGF-mediated morphological differentiation of PC12 cells, also inhibits the induction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation by NGF. 5'-Methylthioadenosine has no effect, however, on EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in cellular proteins. In addition, low temperature markedly slows the rate of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by NGF, but it has no effect on the time course of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF. These data suggest that NGF and EGF induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells by different mechanisms.\r"

The adhesion of these suspension-arrested cells rapidly induces c-fos, c-myc, and actin gene expression. This stimulation did not depend on the presence of serum since the adhesion of suspension-arrested cells, in the absence of serum, also induced the expression of c-fos and c-myc mRNAs. In addition, adhesion onto fibronectin increased the number of cells able to respond to epidermal growth factor and insulin and progress into S phase.

RAD52 gene expression was found to allow growth of gene 46 and 47 mutants under otherwise restrictive conditions, as measured by plaque formation and burst size. Expression of the RAD52 gene also restored the ability of gene 46 and 47 mutants to undergo recombination of rII markers. Furthermore, the RAD52 gene restored the ability of gene 46 and 47 mutants to undergo recombinational repair after UV irradiation.

TNF was found to act synergistically with low concentrations of IL-2 (0.10-0.25 ng/ml), which were ineffective by themselves in inducing LAK activity, to promote the differentiation of LGL into non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted killers. When IL-2 was used at concentrations optimal for LAK generation, TNF did not further enhance this phenomenon. Specific binding of 125I-labeled TNF to LGL was increased by IL-2 stimulation. Scatchard analysis of TNF binding revealed the existence of two classes of binding sites with markedly different affinities (Kd values of 57 and 600 pM). We also demonstrated that the IL-2/TNF synergistic induction of LAK activity did not involve either IL-1 or interferon-gamma. This IL-2/TNF synergistic effect was blocked by anti-Tac antibodies. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that IL-2/TNF selectively up-regulated Tac antigen expression on LAK precursors. Our results suggest a functional interaction between IL-2 and TNF on LAK precursors, which results in a reduction of the IL-2 concentration required for differentiation of LGL into LAK killers.\r"

The nucleotide sequence predicted a 21-residue peptide similar to, but distinct from, porcine endothelin; 15 residues of rat endothelin were identical and 3 residues were substitutions by chemically similar amino acid residues to those in the porcine peptide. Synthetic rat endothelin was then prepared according to its deduced amino acid sequence. This synthetic peptide had (i) potent vasoconstrictor activity in the rat aortic strip and in perfused rat heart and (ii) a characteristically long-lasting in vivo pressor activity by intraaortic bolus injection in the conscious rat.\r"

(1983) Nature (London) 305, 827-829. The regions of similarity extend over a small number of amino acids and require the introduction of gaps through the open reading frame. By using an octapeptide region as the sole criterion for \"taxonomic\" classification, we have grouped the oncoviruses into two distinct categories and the lentiviruses and hepadnaviruses into two additional groupings. This classification suggests that murine and feline leukemia viruses may be more closely related to the viruses that are associated with leukemia in primates and cattle than had been appreciated. We have exploited a portion of this region because of the minimal translational codon degeneracy of the conserved residues. Unique oligonucleotides from this region have been designed and used in the primer-directed in vitro DNA amplification of the hepadnaviruses as a model system. In addition, mixtures of oligonucleotides with various sequences but of the same length were demonstrated to be efficient primers. The amplification procedure enabled dramatic increases in sensitivity and coincident detection of mammalian and avian genomes. This approach will be a valuable tool to detect and characterize members of viral groups. In addition, since short stretches of similarity have been frequently identified in related but distinct genes, such an approach could prove a valuable asset to molecular studies in general.\r"

Because of the continuing importance of tuberculosis and leprosy worldwide, we initiated studies to develop a genetic system in mycobacteria and here report the use of two complementary strategies to introduce and express selectable genetic markers. First, an Escherichia coli cosmid was inserted into the temperate mycobacteriophage L1, generating shuttle phasmids replicating as plasmids in E. coli and phage capable of lysogenizing the mycobacterial host. These temperate shuttle phasmids form turbid plaques on Mycobacterium smegmatis and, upon lysogenization, confer resistance to superinfection and integrate within the mycobacterial chromosome. When an L1 shuttle phasmid containing a cloned gene conferring kanamycin resistance in E. coli was introduced into M. smegmatis, stable kanamycin-resistant colonies--i.e., lysogens--were obtained. Second, to develop a plasmid transformation system in mycobacteria, M. fortuitum/E. coli hybrid plasmids containing mycobacterial and E. coli replicons and a kanamycin-resistance gene were constructed. When introduced into M. smegmatis or BCG (Mycobacterium tuberculosis typus bovinus var. Bacille-Calmette-Guerin) by electroporation, these shuttle plasmids conferred stable kanamycin resistance upon transformants. These systems should facilitate genetic analyses of mycobacterial pathogenesis and the development of recombinant mycobacterial vaccines.\r"

Maximum parsimony analysis revealed six equally parsimonious trees with a consistency index of 0.80. Of the 42 informative sites, 22 were inconsistent with each of the maximum parsimony trees. The spatial distribution of the inconsistent sites was highly nonrandom in a manner implying that intragenic recombination has played a major role in determining the evolutionary history of the nine alleles. The implication is that different segments of the phoA gene have different phylogenetic histories.\r"

As a means of determining whether both of these RNA's are used in the reverse transcription reaction, cells were infected with heterozygous virus particles that varied in nucleotide sequence at two separate locations at the RNA termini. The DNA proviruses formed from a single cycle of reverse transcription were then examined. Of the 12 proviruses that were characterized, all exhibited long terminal repeats (LTR's) that would be expected to arise only if both RNA templates were used for the generation of minus strand DNA. In contrast, only a single minus strand DNA appeared to be used as template for the plus strand DNA in the generation of fully double-stranded viral DNA. These results indicate that the first strand transfer step in reverse transcription is an intermolecular event while that of the second transfer is intramolecular. Thus, retroviruses contain two functionally active RNA's, and both may be required for the generation of a single linear DNA molecule. Formation of heterozygotes during retrovirus infection would be expected to result in the efficient generation of LTR recombinants.\r"

Independent control of electrode voltage allows all of the fields to be generated with electrodes arranged in a closed contour, independent of a particular geometry. This device increases both the resolution in any size range and the speed of separation, especially for DNA molecules larger than 3 megabases.\r"

Homologous chromosomal sequences in the same orientation recombine to form deletions or duplications. When homologous sequences in inverse orientation recombine, one expects to form an inversion of the intervening chromosomal segment. This expectation was tested by placing pairs of homologous sequences in inverse order at various points in the chromosome. Sequences at many pairs of sites (permissive) do recombine to generate the expected inversion, while the same sequences placed at other pairs of sites (nonpermissive) do not form an inversion. For the one nonpermissive interval tested, the missing inversion type can be constructed by an alternative transductional method; strains with this inversion are viable. Thus mechanistic limitations must prevent sequences at particular sites from undergoing the recombination event required to form an inversion.\r"

The RAD6 gene is required for a variety of cellular functions including DNA repair and was recently shown to encode a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. When produced in Escherichia coli, the CDC34 gene product catalyzed the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to histones H2A and H2B in vitro, demonstrating that the CDC34 protein is another distinct member of the family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The cell cycle function of CDC34 is thus likely to be mediated by the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of its product.\r"

The PDGF-A chain gene is markedly less efficient in inducing transformation than the PDGF-B gene under the influence of the same promoter. There are significant differences in the secretory and growth stimulating properties of the two chains. These properties appear to account for the much more potent transforming ability of the PDGF-B gene.

Therefore, a high index of suspicion and the liberal use of arteriography are necessary to avoid missing these injuries. Compression of the brachial plexus by a hematoma can produce a serious neurologic deficit. Prompt evacuation of the hematoma may significantly reduce the deficit, another fact that supports an aggressive surgical approach in these patients.

In the majority of patients, simple resuscitative measures, including employment of the pneumatic antishock garment, will suffice. With certain types of fracture geography, the early application of external fixation devices may also play an important role. Increasingly popular has been the technique of diagnostic angiography and therapeutic embolization, applicable to approximately 3 per cent of all pelvic fracture patients. With exsanguinating hemorrhage, even the best equipped and most sophisticated major trauma centers can be taxed. The decision whether a patient should be taken directly to the operating room or to the angiography suite remains one of the most difficult for even the most highly skilled trauma surgeon. Patients with rapidly expanding or free rupture of pelvic hematomas noted at the time of celiotomy, or those with large open wounds, usually leave no recourse but to attempt direct operative control, to include even the most morbid option of a life-saving hemipelvectomy or corpectomy. More often, however, once other sources of surgically correctable hemorrhage are controlled or ruled out, diagnostic angiography followed by therapeutic embolization is a mainstay in the modern-day management of pelvic fracture hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "There has been considerable interest in the management of injured extremity veins since the American experience during the Vietnam War. Fortunately, there are an increasing number of reports from civilian experience in the United States that add valuable information. Although the controversy continues, it appears that there is merit in repair of many injured lower-extremity veins, particularly the popliteal vein when it is a single return conduit, assuming that the patient's general condition will permit, in an attempt to prevent acute venous hypertension initially and chronic venous hypertension subsequently. Figure 1 identifies the recovery potential that exists even if the initial venous repair fails. In contrast to thrombosis in the arterial system, recanalization is the rule in venous thrombosis. Patent valves can exist above and below the rather localized area of thrombosis. It appears that recanalization will prevent the problems of chronic venous insufficiency. It is obvious that many patients do well for years; however, the sequelae of acute venous hypertension may be more demonstrable after 10 or 15 years. There has not been similar evidence supporting a more aggressive approach in general in upper-extremity veins. However, it should be appreciated that a return pathway must remain patent, as noted in replantation of extremities. Obviously, there are differences in military and civilian wounds, with the former usually having more extensive soft-tissue destruction and obliteration of collateral veins and lymphatic channels. Unfortunately, many civilian gunshot wounds are being seen in the United States that are similar to the military type. We must not forget the lessons of the past, and we must continue to analyze our experience in the management of injured veins under a variety of conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Initially, soft-tissue injuries associated with vascular trauma require management according to the general surgical principles of wound care. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be instituted. The mechanism and extent of injury must be determined, and debridement and irrigation should be completed in the operating room with the intent to preserve vital structures, decrease bacterial contamination, and render the wound free of devitalized tissue. Prompt coverage of exposed vascular repairs is vital in order to minimize the chance for infection and to protect the repair from desiccation and subsequent trauma. Early primary closure of heavily contaminated wounds can have disastrous results. Therefore, questionable wounds should be managed by delayed primary closure after repeated irrigation and debridements, with the definitive decision as to the timing of wound closure being based on quantitative cultures. The plastic and reconstructive surgeon can aid the vascular surgeon in the primary or secondary closure of such wounds by bringing healthy, vascularized muscle to cover the vascular repair. Vascularized muscle has proved superior in the coverage and healing of contaminated wounds. If conditions permit, this can be most readily accomplished by transfer of local muscle. Musculocutaneous flaps are of special value in cases that require increased durability or where extended coverage is necessary. With either of these flap techniques, the surgeon must be thoroughly familiar with the anatomy, blood supply, and function of the local muscles. Free-tissue transfer is to be utilized when local tissue is severely damaged in a way that precludes the use of adjacent muscle or myocutaneous flaps. Strict adherence to the principles and techniques of microsurgery, thorough evaluation of the zone of injury and recipient blood vessels, and understanding of the principles governing local muscle transfer are essential for a successful outcome.\r"

  ".U": "88321963\r", 
  ".W": "Nerve injuries associated with acute vascular trauma are a formidable obstacle to restoring useful limb function. Nerve injury has become the primary cause of long-term disability as the success rate of acute revascularization has risen to well over 90 per cent. Nerve injuries occur in roughly 60 to 70 per cent of upper-extremity vascular injuries and in approximately 25 per cent of lower-extremity vascular injuries. These neural injuries account for a permanent disability rate of between 27 and 44 per cent. Establishing early continuity of completely transected nerves along with early exploration of lesions in continuity provides the best chance for timely axonal regrowth and reinnervation of the distal musculature. The use of intraoperative nerve action potential monitoring has allowed us to explore lesions in continuity earlier without unnecessary resection and suture of lesions showing sufficient axonal regeneration. At present, because of the relatively slow rate of axonal regeneration seen in axonotmetic or neurotmetic injuries (after repair), very proximal nerve injuries in either the upper or lower extremity will continue to lead to disappointingly poor motor recovery in the limb distally.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty to thirty per cent of patients with arterial injuries and some patients with venous injuries require interpositional grafting. The first choice of grafting material for both arterial and venous injuries is autogenous vein. Injuries to large vessels such as the aorta and superior vena cava may necessitate synthetic prostheses. Synthetic aortic prostheses have excellent long-term patency rates, but the same materials are much less likely to remain patent in the vena cava. Panel or spiral grafts constructed from saphenous vein appear to be the best replacement for this vessel. Autogenous veins are present in different diameters ranging from a mean of 6.4 mm in the saphenous vein to a mean of 1.8 cm in the internal jugular vein. The thickest autogenous vein is the saphenous vein, and thus it is preferred for medium-sized and small arteries. The authors prefer the larger 7.5-mm cephalic vein for replacement of medium-sized veins. In the absence of suitable saphenous vein, the cephalic vein is also the choice for arterial interposition grafts. Although there are few reports of the use of arterial autografts in vascular trauma, the surgeon should be aware that autografts may be ideal for vascular injuries in children and for isolated injuries with severe contamination. Finally, the use of synthetic grafts in injuries where adequate tissue coverage is not possible may result in immediate limb salvage, but the incidence of limb loss in this situation will be extremely high.\r"

In addition, recent evidence has shown that percutaneous drainage of splenic abscess is a safe and efficacious approach to therapy and is indicated especially when patients are seriously ill, postoperative or when the risks of general anesthesia, surgical drainage or splenectomy are substantial. Adequacy of response to percutaneous drainage correlates positively with the presence of unilocular collections that have a discrete wall without internal septations. In contrast, multiloculated or complex pyogenic splenic abscesses should usually be treated using operative intervention. Discussion of important features of this illness, as well as a comprehensive review of reported instances and guidelines related to percutaneous drainage of splenic abscess, are presented herein. A team approach, which uses the experience of imaging and surgical personnel, is invaluable in therapy when a splenic abscess is encountered.\r"

If these were the only issues, the choice of operation would be easy. Unfortunately, some of the most contentious issues in treatment of metastasis to the neck have been linked with the concept of the modified neck dissection. Such issues as combined multimodality therapy, preoperative and postoperative radiation therapy or surgical treatment alone, prophylactic dissection and bilateral simultaneous dissection of the neck are rightly or wrongly tied in with the type of dissection of the neck. More information, such as the certainty of the real risk factors in the neck with metastatic disease, the real value, if any, of adjunctive combined therapy and basic information about the role of the nodes in the neck, is necessary before the debate on the modified versus the radical dissection of the neck will end.\r"

Based on the limitations in the original design applying to our own set of requirements, including tumor stereotaxis, we totally redesigned the system around the arc-quadrant principle of the original Todd-Wells instrument. While this intermediate system was being used in our surgical practice, further limitations were noted and corrected in the system we presently use. The present stereotactic frame is completely interactive with an operating room computer system.\r"

The nonexudative stage includes hard drusen (associated with localized dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium [RPE]), soft drusen (associated with diffuse dysfunction of the RPE), and geographic (areolar) atrophy. These fundus changes may predispose the eye to develop the neovascular/exudative stages of AMD. Most patients who develop severe visual loss from AMD have this exudative stage. Treatment for AMD has been shown to be effective for only a small proportion of patients who have a well-defined choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) more than 200 microns from the foveal center. Even in successfully treated cases, severe visual loss is postponed only for about 18 months because of the high rate of recurrent CNVMs that extend into the fovea. Thus, despite recent breakthroughs in laser treatment for AMD, most patients who develop the exudative form of AMD will develop central visual impairment. At the present time, the only available treatments for the majority of patients who develop the exudative form of AMD are low vision aids. Investigators are currently evaluating whether treatment is effective for membranes within 200 microns of the foveal center. Future studies need to be directed toward further understanding of the pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of the blinding complications of AMD.\r"

The molar ratio of BCAA to aromatic amino acids in the BCAA group was increased postoperatively, whereas the ratio in the control group was decreased, the difference being statistically significant. Among the 29 who received BCAA, three (10.3%) had hepatic encephalopathy; two died and one recovered. Of the 27 control patients, hepatic encephalopathy occurred in three (11.1%); one died and two recovered. There was no significant difference in rate of occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy between the groups. Thus the infusion of BCAA-enriched solution apparently had no preventive effect with regard to hepatic encephalopathy for patients with cirrhosis who underwent surgical treatment.\r"

Return of satisfactory cardiac function occurred in all but one animal. An early high mortality rate was due primarily to pulmonary complications, but with modifications to the technique, long-term survival increased to 70%. Early deaths (5 days to 13 weeks) of five dogs during preliminary trials were due to pleural effusion (2), sepsis (1), endocarditis (1), and ascites (1). There have been 14 long-term survivors (range, 194 to 498 days; mean, 264 days). Long-term survivors appear well, are active, and show satisfactory growth. This experimental model eliminates the need for heparinization and reduces the potential for complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass in the dog. It avoids cannulations that might impinge on anastomotic sites. This model appears to be suited for studying growth of the transplanted heart.\r"

Our results are correlated with a review of the literature. In our review of studies in which subclavian venous catheterizations were prospectively examined with use of objective means of diagnosis, we found that 28% of all subclavian catheterizations had venous thrombosis develop, often subclinically. This is not an innocuous disease, as suggested in the past; in our series 12% of upper-extremity DVT had pulmonary embolization (PE). In reviewing the recent literature, we found an average 12.4% incidence of PE, which often occurs during anticoagulation treatment. Diagnostic modalities are discussed and treatment regimens are reviewed along with an extensive literature review.\r"

In contrast, those patients undergoing vasovasostomy ten years after original vasectomy had sperm counts of over 20 million/mL in 43 per cent of the cases, with a zero pregnancy rate. A significant reduction in total operative time was achieved as compared to the conventional microsurgical suture technique, corroborating the ability of the CO2 laser to simplify this technique while producing a sperm-tight anastomosis. One of the drawbacks of this operation is that it is not suited for the performance of a vasoepididymostomy which could be required in those cases in which sperm is absent from the vas fluid at the time of vasovasostomy.\r"

Of these, 15 subsequently underwent surgical procedures for relief of hypertension. Seven were \"cured,\" six were \"improved,\" and two were \"unchanged.\" The severity of hypertension could not be correlated with the degree of reflux nor with the degree of obstructive uropathy. However, all children with reflux in our study who were hypertensive had some degree of calicectasis noted preoperatively on intravenous pyelogram. Also it was noted that hypertension may occur several years after successful anti-reflux surgery. Children with vesicoureteral reflux, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, or a small kidney need to have blood pressure determinations at regular intervals, even if all previous readings had been in the normotensive range and whether or not they were followed up medically or post surgically. We suggest that blood pressure determinations be made every three months for the first year after diagnosis of reflux or ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and at least once a year thereafter.\r"

PPA and estriol in combination as well as PPA alone, raised the intraurethral pressure and significantly reduced the urinary loss by 35 per cent in a standardized physical strain test. In women with an initial low urethral pressure estriol also induced pressure increase. The leakage episodes and the assessed leakage amounts were significantly reduced by both estriol and PPA given separately as single treatment (28%) or when given as combined therapy (40%). Most of the women preferred the combined treatment to either drug alone. Additive but no synergistic effects are indicated.\r"

Four major clinical syndromes are pure motor hemiparesis, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, and the dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome. The advent of computed tomography (CT) has allowed the antemortem study of lacunar disease and has shed new light on the pathogenesis and clinical course of lacunar strokes. Recently, it has been demonstrated that lacunar strokes may be embolic or hemorrhagic in causation, are not invariably associated with hypertension, and may be larger and associated with hypertension, and may be larger and associated with neurological manifestations that do not conform to the classic patterns. In most instances, however, recognition of the characteristic clinical presentation and confirmation of the diagnosis with noninvasive studies spare many patients unnecessary risks associated with anticoagulation, arteriography, or vascular surgery.\r"

Fifty-two elderly patients (mean age = 72 years, range = 63-87 years) with degenerative joint disease and multiple concomitant illnesses were randomly selected to receive ibuprofen suspension (400 mg) or aspirin (650 mg) 4 times a day. Serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), weight, and blood pressure were measured at baseline and at weekly intervals for 6 weeks. There were no significant changes from baseline in any tests reflective of renal function, no significant differences between ibuprofen and aspirin, and no influence of concomitant diuretic therapy. Ibuprofen and aspirin administered in the doses examined for 6 weeks appear to have little effect on renal function as measured by serum Cr and BUN in a sample of elderly patients for whom these drugs are commonly employed. Concomitant diuretic therapy does not appear to increase the risk. While these drugs are contraindicated in patients with severe hemodynamic insult, they should not be withheld from elderly patients who require this therapy for analgesic/anti-inflammatory effects because of concern for renal impairment. Further prospective research should be undertaken to clarify levels of patient risk and to define appropriate monitoring in such patients.\r"

Diabetes occurred in 78 patients (10%). Patients with diabetes had a different risk factor pattern, including higher age, higher occurrence of angina pectoris and hypertension, whereas smoking habits did not differ. In the early phase (hospitalization), patients with diabetes had a higher mortality (12% versus 8%), required more treatment for heart failure and stayed longer in hospital. Other morbidity aspects, such as severity of pain, occurrence of severe supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, high-degree AV-block and infarct size did not differ. During 5 years' follow-up mortality rate in patients with diabetes mellitus was 55% as compared with 30% among patients with no diabetes (p less than 0.001). Reinfarction rate during 5 years was 42% in diabetics versus 25% in non-diabetics (p less than 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, taking into account the differences in risk factor pattern, diabetes turned out to be an independent determinant for long-term mortality and reinfarction (p less than 0.001). We conclude that patients with diabetes mellitus, developing acute myocardial infarction, is a group with particularly high risk of death and reinfarction. Interventions aiming at its reduction have priority.\r"

The patients had significantly lower GFR, higher SBP and higher PRA in hydropenia, but there was no significant difference in RPF, FF, DBP or p-Aldo. After volume expansion, SBP, DBP, PRA and p-Aldo were significantly higher in patients than in controls. Transition to 3% volume expansion was associated with a similar increase in SBP in both patients and controls, whereas DBP increased significantly more in the patients (p less than 0.01). Volume expansion resulted in a significant suppression of PRA and p-Aldo in both patients and controls. The patients with renal scarring had the same capacity to excrete sodium and water during transition to volume expansion as the healthy controls. The renin-aldosterone system seems abnormally activated and is probably more important than hypervolemia in the development of hypertension in this group of patients.\r"

Patients were evaluated by simultaneous respiratory gas exchange and radionuclide ventriculography measurements during graded maximal exercise testing. Improvement was demonstrated in both peak oxygen uptake and radionuclide-determined cardiac index after 30 days of treatment with OPC-8212. These changes were not associated with alterations in heart rate at rest or during peak exercise. Furthermore OPC-8212 significantly decreased ventricular ectopy in our patients. However, two patients had possible hematologic toxicity with prolonged use. The results of the present phase II study suggest that a larger randomized double-blind placebo study to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of this drug is warranted.\r"

The choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, associated diseases, compliance, side effects, and status of left ventricular function. The main mechanism of improvement is a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption, though an increase in coronary blood flow is another potential reason for the use of calcium blockers. This review considers the properties of these drugs, their mechanism of action, and the results of randomized studies.\r"

To evaluate pulmonary valve competence after this operation, we used color Doppler flow mapping to examine 45 survivors of pulmonary artery-to-ascending aorta anastomosis a median of 202 days postoperatively. Of 37 patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, mild regurgitation was detected in 9 (24%) and moderate regurgitation in 1 (3%). Of 8 with other lesions, mild regurgitation was observed in 2 and moderate regurgitation in 1. Seven of 11 patients imaged greater than or equal to 12 months postoperatively had regurgitation. In summary, one-fourth of survivors developed mild pulmonary regurgitation. Its presence should not be considered a contraindication to eventual application of Fontan's principle, although further follow-up appears warranted because the long-term fate of pulmonary valve function is not yet known.\r"

To determine whether abnormalities in LV geometry due to RV dilatation result in abnormalities in the LV diastolic filling pattern, we obtained pulsed Doppler transmitral recordings from 23 patients with RV dilatation with RV systolic pressure estimated to be less than 40 mm Hg (group 1), 18 patients with RV dilatation and RV systolic pressures greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg (group 2) and 33 normal patients. RV systolic pressures were estimated from continuous wave Doppler peak tricuspid regurgitation velocities using the modified Bernoulli equation. Diastolic filling parameters in group 1 patients were similar to normals. In group 2 patient, increased peak atrial filling velocity (76 +/- 14 vs 57 +/- 12 cm/s, p less than 0.001), decreased peak rapid filling velocity/peak atrial filling velocity (1.1 +/- 0.4 vs 1.5 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.01), increased atrial filling fraction (41 +/- 14 vs 30 +/- 10%, p less than 0.01) and prolongation of the atrial filling period (171 +/- 47 vs 152 +/- 39 ms, p less than 0.05) were noted compared with the normal group. RV end-diastolic size and LV end-systolic shape were significantly correlated with the atrial filling fraction in group 2 patients. In patients with RV dilatation and RV systolic pressures greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg, there is increased reliance on atrial systolic contribution to the LV filling volume.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), skeletal muscle blood flow can be measured directly by the continuous thermodilution technique and by the xenon133 clearance method. The continuous thermodilution technique requires retrograde catheterization of the femoral vein and, thus, cannot be repeated conveniently in patients during evaluation of pharmacologic interventions. The xenon133 clearance, which requires only an intramuscular injection, allows repeated determination of skeletal muscle blood flow. In patients with severe CHF, a fixed capacity of the skeletal muscle vasculature to dilate appears to limit maximal exercise performance. Moreover, the changes in peak skeletal muscle blood flow noted during long-term administration of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, appears to correlate with the changes in aerobic capacity. In patients with CHF, resting supine deep femoral vein oxygen content can be used as an indirect measurement of resting skeletal muscle blood flow. The absence of a steady state complicates the determination of peak skeletal muscle blood flow reached during graded bicycle or treadmill exercise in patients with chronic CHF. Indirect assessments of skeletal muscle blood flow and metabolism during exercise performed at submaximal work loads are currently developed in patients with chronic CHF.\r"

  ".U": "88324154\r", 
  ".W": "The function of the renal baroreceptor can be quantitatively described by a stimulus-response curve showing a flat section in the high pressure range, a steep slope in the low pressure range, and a well-defined threshold pressure slightly below resting systemic pressure. This stimulus-response curve shows a close functional relation to autoregulation of renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion. Threshold pressure and slope are subject to different physiologic control mechanisms: The slope is increased by a low sodium diet, whereas threshold pressure is elevated by an increased renal sympathetic nerve discharge or by circulating catecholamines. Sympathetic influences also reset renal autoregulation. Recent studies have provided evidence for an important role of the renal baroreceptor in the long-term control of arterial blood pressure. The sympathetic modulation of threshold pressure can induce sodium retention in early heart failure, and the sympathetic effects on autoregulation may help to explain clinical reports on a deterioration of renal function during converting-enzyme therapy.\r"

  ".U": "88324157\r", 
  ".W": "Blood flow to skeletal muscle during exercise is limited in patients with chronic congestive heart failure compared with normal persons. This may, in part, be attributed to the inability of the vessels to dilate adequately. In addition, an abnormal skeletal muscle metabolism with oxidative capacity can be demonstrated in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The latter may partially explain why vasodilators and inotropes that improve central hemodynamics, global leg perfusion or skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise do not increase oxygen uptake by working muscle after acute drug administration. Furthermore, increases in blood flow to skeletal muscle may be redistributed to inactive or less oxygen-dependent muscle fibers. Although acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition usually neither exerts substantial improvement in exercise hemodynamics nor interferes with leg perfusion during exercise, skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen uptake gradually increases with long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme therapy, leading to improved systemic oxygen consumption and exercise tolerance. Several factors, such as reduction in plasma and vascular angiotensin II and sympathetic nervous activity, increased prostaglandin levels and renal function may contribute to this beneficial long-term effect.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the safety, antianginal and antiischemic effects of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. The patients (n = 29) were evaluated during a 26-week single-blind dose titration phase followed by a 6-week double-blind placebo-randomized withdrawal phase. No patient withdrawals resulted from adverse events directly related to amlodipine. A comparison of the antianginal effects of amlodipine in the single-blind phase with the placebo phase showed a reduction in anginal episodes (p less than 0.001) and a decrease in sublingual nitroglycerin usage (p less than 0.01) that persisted in the treated double-blind group (n = 12). The place-bo double-blind group (n = 10) had a reduction in anginal episodes, but no significant change in sublingual nitroglycerin usage. The antiischemic effects of amlodipine were evident; there was an increase in exercise tolerance and a reduction of ST-segment depression, as seen in the 24-hour after-dose (range 23 to 30 hours) exercise tread-mill test. During single-blind therapy, total exercise time (p less than 0.001) and time to 1 mm ST depression (p less than 0.001) displayed an overall improvement. During the double-blind phase, the treated group demonstrated an improvement in total exercise time (p = 0.01) while the placebo group had no significant change. The total amount of ST depression also differed between treated and placebo groups (1.2 +/- 0.12 vs 1.8 +/- 0.17 mm, respectively, p less than 0.01). These results lend support to the clinical safety of this medication used as once-a-day therapy.\r"

The interobserver variability of grading coronary artery perfusion by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study Group (TIMI) criteria was measured as well as the effect of different definitions of reperfusion on the determination of reperfusion rate. There was good agreement in the reading of infarct artery flow grades between 2 blinded observers for each grade considered separately (k = 0.726 +/- 0.014) and for grades 0 or 1 (no perfusion) versus grades 2 or 3 (perfusion) (k = 0.905 +/- 0.011). Discordance between grades 0 or 1 versus 2 or 3 occurred in 74 (5%) of the 1,615 angiographic readings. Discrepancies of clinical significance which affected qualification for study entry, reperfusion or reocclusion status occurred in only 15 patients (6%). Grade 1 flow was found to have the most variable interpretation. Reperfusion rates for APSAC and streptokinase differed significantly when reperfusion was defined by 3 different criteria. The reperfusion rate ranged from 51 to 72% for APSAC and from 60 to 75% for streptokinase depending upon criteria selected. For comparison of the results of different thrombolytic studies, a standard semiquantitative system for grading infarct artery perfusion should be used, readings should be blinded and the criteria used for the definition of reperfusion should be clearly specified.\r"

This study assesses the relative value of multiple electrocardiographic variables for detecting LV hypertrophy in patients with right BBB. LV hypertrophy was defined as LV mass greater than or equal to 215 g calculated from the Penn method using standard M-mode echo measurements. Sixty-two patients were evaluated (ages 41 to 94) and 35 had LV hypertrophy. None of the electrocardiographic criteria was sensitive; the best was mean QRS axis less than or equal to -30 degrees (sensitivity) 52%) and excessive negative P terminal force (sensitivity 28%). Several electrocardiographic variables were specific: Sokolow index greater than or equal to 35 mm (100%), RV5 or RV6 greater than or equal to 25 mm (96.3%), RI + SIII greater than or equal to 25 mm (92.6%) and intrinsicoid deflection greater than or equal to 0.05 seconds (88.5%). Conventional electrocardiographic criteria do not reliably detect LV hypertrophy in the presence of right BBB, but several criteria are relatively specific for LV hypertrophy.\r"

Fifty-three studies were performed in 21 patients, 17 men and 4 women, aged 19 to 54 years (mean 37 +/- 8), from 7 to 40 months after transplantation. Repeat studies were available in 8, and 10 were studied after the first year of transplantation. A heart-to-lung ratio was used for quantitation of uptake (normal 1.46 +/- 0.04). Differences between absent (1.69 +/- 0.29) and moderate (1.90 +/- 0.36) rejection were significant (p less than 0.03). Antimyosin ratio at 1 to 3 months (1.89 +/- 0.35) differed from that at greater than 12 months (1.65 +/- 0.2) (p less than 0.01). Repeat studies revealed a decrease in antimyosin ratio in 5 patients with uneventful clinical course; 2 had persistent activity after transplantation and suffered heart failure from rejection. After 1 year of transplantation uptake was within normal limits in 7 of 10 patients, and high uptake was associated with vascular rejection in 1. Because they can define evolving patterns of myocardial lesion activity, antimyosin studies could be useful both in patient management and in concentrating resources for those patients who most require them. The heart-to-lung ratio is suggested to monitor sequentially the degree of myocyte damage after transplantation.\r"

The glucagon responses were unchanged and similar in both groups under all study conditions. In both normal and NIDDM subjects the glucose and insulin response to a particular starch is not a stable feature dependent on the unique characteristics of the starch molecule but is affected by food processing and the form in which it is presented to the gastrointestinal tract.\r"
