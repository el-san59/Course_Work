Four hours after administration of RU38486, the levels of progesterone (P) started to fall and continued to show a gradual decline until the abortion was completed, when a steep fall to follicular phase values was observed. Levels of placental protein 14 remained unaltered until 2 days after RU38486 administration, when levels were increased. The rise in placental protein 14 in association with falling P concentrations suggests that the decidual secretion of placental protein 14 might be independent of P. Fertil Steril 52:66, 1989.\r"

Zona-drilling also was done for eggs from patients with previous failed in vitro fertilization (IVF). Forty-seven eggs from seven patients with oligozoospermia and three patients with failed IVF had a mean of between 2.6 and 3.6 sperm transferred into the perivitelline space. In the group whose eggs had zona-drilling with acid PBS, 1 of 13 eggs fertilized from the oligozoospermic category, while there was no fertilization from the failed IVF category. Karyotyping of the unfertilized eggs after zona-drilling revealed a high incidence (2/5 and 3/7, respectively) of possible arrest at anaphase II after reinitiation of meiosis. In the group whose eggs were directly punctured through the zona in the presence of cytochalasin D, there was no fertilization in 23 undamaged eggs. Two of the 15 interpretable karyotypes were aneuploid, but this incidence is within that observed for our unfertilized eggs after IVF. Hence, the use of acid PBS for zona-drilling is not advised. Moreover, transfer of sperm from men with previous failed fertilization resulted in poor fertilization rates.\r"

A better pregnancy rate (19.4%/ET) can be achieved when TDT catheter was used under ultrasound guidance. The Frydman catheter (Prodimed, Neuilly-en-Thelle, France) yielded the highest pregnancy rate (32.3%/ET) but also the highest frequency of difficult transfer procedures. The Wallace catheter (H.G. Wallace Limited, Colchester, England) showed similar performance, but the pregnancy rate was lower (19.2%/ET) compared with the Frydman catheter. Therefore, the Frydman catheter is used as the first choice, and for difficult transfers the TDT catheter under ultrasound guidance can be recommended.\r"

Because these two entities share the common goal of alleviating physician shortages in rural areas, a study was conducted to determine the nature and extent of their interaction. Questionnaires were mailed to all AHEC projects and all nonmilitary family practice residency programs. Response rates were 100% and 79%, respectively. Elective rural rotations (usually preceptorships) are offered by 135 (49%) residencies, but only 84 (31%) require them. Fourteen (64%) AHEC projects interact with family practice residencies; however, only 9% (15/167) of the programs in those states utilize AHEC resources. The authors conclude that additional rural rotations could be offered to family practice residents by taking advantage of under-utilized resources of the National AHEC Program.\r"

Virtually all studies examining this problem base their data on subjects who are already within or beyond the medical education process. Thus, such studies may obscure the degree to which practice site preferences are a result of the medical education selection process, or to what degree they were present in the premedical student population. Medical school applicants were surveyed about their intended practice site choices, as well as a number of characteristics thought to be correlated with intended practice sites. Eleven characteristics were found to be associated with intended practice sites. A disproportionately large number of applicants intended to practice in mid-size communities, a disproportionately low number of applicants in rural areas. There was no statistically significant difference in the acceptance rates of applicants who planned to practice in rural areas and those who did not.\r"

The current retrospective study, conducted at a community based nursing facility, compared medical records of 54 Mexican-Americans to 30 non-Hispanic whites (Anglos). The records were reviewed with respect to demographics, major/minor diagnoses, functional status, and mental status data. Several differences were noted. Mexican-Americans were significantly more functionally impaired (mean = 22.2) than Anglos (mean = 20.0, P = .008). Further, Mexican-Americans demonstrated a significantly higher degree of mental impairment (mean = 3.2) than Anglos (mean = 2.3, P = .040). Finally, investigators noted that although statistically nonsignificant, a greater percentage of Mexican-Americans (40.7%) suffered cerebrovascular attacks (CVAs) than did Anglos (23.3%, P = .11). These results indicate that Mexican-Americans are entering nursing homes more functionally and mentally impaired than their Anglo counterparts, due in part perhaps to CVAs. This study suggests that an extended family structure may help Mexican-Americans stay in the community until greater degrees of disabilities have been reached.\r"

Profiles for those living with children but without spouses and those living with spouses provided the most extreme contrasts. Persons living alone and never married consistently had better outcomes than those living alone but ever married. After one year, changes in living arrangements were most likely to occur for those living with spouse/children and those living with others. For the elderly, \"Who lives with you?\", is an important question.\r"

A mail survey was conducted using a random sample of patients not returning for care over a three-year period in a primary care office. Over half of the inactive patients were transient, never having established themselves with the practice. One third of regular attending inactive patients had changed physicians, whereas the others had simply not returned for care. Patients who had changed physicians were more likely users of emergency rooms or drop-in clinics, had more negative feelings while in physicians' offices, were less satisfied with their own present physicians, and had less positive attitudes toward physicians in general. Inactive patients who had not changed physicians were as satisfied with their own physicians and with physicians in general as the active patient control subjects, even though they used services infrequently, usually for acute care. Investigating transient patients and those who are inactive but remain with a practice would positively affect patient volume and would likely benefit these patients as well. Primary care physicians should survey their own inactive files before embarking on other marketing techniques.\r"

At the end of 30 months, significantly more preventive medicine items--smoking, height, blood group, tetanus and rubella immunization status and family planning--had been recorded for patients in the computerized group. For other items, requiring more frequent measurements, computerization produced an advantage only for blood pressure and breast examination, but not for weight, occult blood and serum cholesterol. Recording rates increased significantly for patients in both the control and the computerized groups for all the items. Using the computer lengthened the average consultation time from 8.5 minutes to 10 minutes. Such systems are a valuable aid to encouraging doctors to increase the amount of preventive medicine they incorporate into their routine practice.\r"

It was found that the sampling bias in opportunistic research was that subjects selected were more likely to be older with more problems, and have a higher attendance rate at the clinic. The bias could be corrected during the analysis of data by stratifying the selected sample into groups of different attendance rates. Another potential sampling bias was due to non-compliance of both the patients and the clinical staff. However, it was found to be possible to obtain useful results from opportunistic research.

However, an association between changing a drug and dissatisfaction was noted, and there was a trend of decreasing satisfaction with prescribing and with information given about drugs over the three years in all the practices. Overall 51% of patients felt that they had either too little or no information given to them about their drugs. Improving information given to both doctors and patients about drugs may be important in improving prescribing without causing discontentment.\r"

  ".W": "This study is a survey of general practitioners practising in an area in Melbourne, Australia, where there are two medium sized public hospitals with limited general practitioner admitting rights. A questionnaire was mailed to the 207 general practitioners practising in the study area; 167 (81%) responded. Seventy one per cent of respondents had public hospital admitting rights and 73% aimed to manage as many medical patients in hospital as possible. The main reasons given for such involvement were patient expectation, professional satisfaction and the benefits to patients, beyond that of reassurance, which followed from continuity of care. About half of respondents (52%) agreed that their role was a liaison or coordinating one alongside hospital specialists. Fifty-four per cent of respondents overall had in fact managed at least two medical patients in public hospitals in the past 12 months. Lack of availability of general practitioner beds and specialist dominance in public hospitals rather than inadequate time or remuneration were perceived to be the main barriers to hospital practice. Almost three-quarters of respondents (72%) believed general practitioners would be excluded from public hospitals in the foreseeable future. They blamed specialist dominance and general practitioner apathy equally for this predicted state of affairs. A debate on the desirability or otherwise of such an exclusion is overdue within the medical community in order to consider what will otherwise be a fait accompli.\r"

One-fifth of the respondents did not report the type of malpractice insurance retained for residents and over half did not report the cost of insurance for residents. Current problems with liability were most often related to the region of the country, number of visits to the family practice centre, the number of residents, the number of faculty, the type of faculty employer and the type of resident employer. Programmes which anticipated future problems with liability were most likely to be those with current problems. The areas identified as most concerning to residents included: obstetrics, cost of malpractice insurance, difficulty obtaining coverage, and the general anxiety created by malpractice litigation.\r"

  ".W": "Folate deficiency has been associated with dysplasia in human cancer models. Patients with ulcerative colitis commonly have decreased folate levels, which are partially due to sulfasalazine, a competitive inhibitor of folate absorption. To study the effect of folate supplementation on the risk of dysplasia or cancer (neoplasia) in ulcerative colitis, records from 99 patients with pancolitis for greater than 7 yr and enrolled in a surveillance program were reviewed. Thirty-five patients with neoplasia were compared with 64 patients in whom dysplasia was never found to determine the effect of folate supplementation on the rate of development of neoplasia using case-control methodology. At the time of the index colonoscopy, patients with neoplasia were older (43 +/- 11 vs. 39 +/- 12 yr) and had disease of longer duration (20 +/- 8 vs. 15 +/- 7 yr, p less than 0.05). Folate supplementation was associated with a 62% lower incidence of neoplasia compared with individuals not receiving supplementation (odds ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-1.20). There was no appreciable change in this effect when models were fit to adjust for sulfasalazine dose, duration of disease, age at symptom onset, prednisone dose, sulfa allergy, sex, race, or family history of colon cancer. The statistical power of the association between folate supplementation and neoplasia was 72%. Correction of risk factors before the development of neoplasia may prevent this serious complication. Pending a larger case-control study, folate supplementation during sulfasalazine administration is recommended to possibly prevent the complication of dysplasia or cancer in ulcerative colitis.\r"

Galanin strongly inhibited gastrointestinal motility. Gastric emptying was significantly delayed, with the time taken to empty 50% of the gastric contents increasing from 59.0 +/- 4.8 min (control infusion) to 99.3 +/- 4.7 min (galanin infusion). Mouth-to-cecum transit time increased from 67.5 +/- 6.9 to 126.3 +/- 18.5 min. Galanin potently suppressed the initial postprandial rise in plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, peptide tyrosine tyrosine, neurotensin, enteroglucagon, pancreatic glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, but did not change gastric inhibitory polypeptide, motilin, peptide histidine methionine, and gastrin concentrations compared with control. The results indicate that an infusion of galanin has potent effects on the gastrointestinal tract in humans. The changes in motor activity in particular suggest that the local galaninergic innervation could have an important physiologic role in the control of human gastrointestinal propulsive motor activity.\r"

Celiac disease was mentioned on the death certificate in 33 cases but in only 10 was it given as the underlying cause of death. Of 17 deaths from lymphoproliferative diseases (0.55 expected, p less than 0.001), 8 occurred within 2 yr of diagnosis of celiac disease compared with 8 (0.37 expected, p less than 0.001) occurring greater than 5 yr after diagnosis. Esophageal cancer was certified as the cause of four deaths (0.47 expected, p less than 0.01). In men mortality from all other malignant disease was also increased (15 deaths observed; 6.4 expected, p less than 0.01), but most of these deaths occurred within 5 yr of the diagnosis of celiac disease. In contrast, there was no deficit in deaths from ischemic heart disease or stroke and the mortality rate in those diagnosed in childhood as having celiac disease was similar to the general population.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic laser treatment is reported in 264 patients with benign rectosigmoid villous adenomas revealed by biopsy. Patients include 100 who had contraindications to surgery, 60 who had a tumor recurrence after a nonlaser treatment, 101 for whom surgical resection appeared to be too drastic for a tumor found benign on biopsy, and 3 who refused surgery. Two types of lasers were used: the Nd:YAG and the argon laser. In some patients, both lasers were used. Treatment was completed in 226 patients. Total tumor destruction was attained in 92% of them, a carcinoma was detected in 7% on biopsy specimens obtained during laser treatment, and benign villous tissue persisted in 1%. During the average 25.9-mo follow-up period of the patients with total tumor destruction, 13% had a tumor recurrence. Treatment was well-tolerated with no major complications. The circumferential extension of the tumor base was the only factor affecting the duration of treatment, and the rate of complications. The recurrence rate after initial treatment was higher in patients treated for a recurrence after a previous nonlaser treatment than in patients treated only by laser (p = 0.04). It was also higher when the initial histology was low-grade dysplasia than if it was high-grade dysplasia (p = 0.017) and when the tumor was located in the lower or middle rectum as opposed to the upper rectum or sigmoid (p = 0.04). We estimated that the direct cost of laser treatments was 28%-40% of the surgery charges for lesions of identical size in our hospital and 31%-69% at UCLA Center for the Health Sciences. Because treatment is long and difficult and the cancer rate is high, endoscopic laser for patients with a circumferential villous adenoma should be limited to nonsurgical candidates. The risk of a fatal complication after surgery has to be balanced against the risk of undetected carcinoma in the other patients and the indication for endoscopic laser treatment should be discussed case by case.\r"

  ".U": "89306400\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism by which bilateral adrenalectomy worsens indomethacin-induced gastric lesions was investigated in rats. In sham-operated rats subcutaneously administered indomethacin produced gastric lesions at doses of 10 mg/kg body wt or greater, in association with lowering of blood glucose levels. In a parallel study, indomethacin induced gastric hypermotility at the same dose levels but had no effect on acid output or mucosal blood flow even at 25 mg/kg body wt. Adrenalectomy (2 wk) itself significantly reduced the blood glucose levels (approximately 50%) and markedly potentiated the ulcerogenic and motility responses caused by indomethacin; the ED50 values dropped to approximately 10 times lower than those in sham-operated rats. Both acid output and mucosal blood flow were significantly reduced by adrenalectomy, but these values were increased after indomethacin treatment (3 mg/kg body wt). The ulcerogenic and motility responses caused by indomethacin were significantly reduced by acute infusion of glucose (25% wt/wt, 1.2 ml/h) intravenously in both sham-operated and adrenalectomized rats, and by subcutaneous administration of hydrocortisone acetate (10 mg/kg body wt for 2 wk) in the latter group. When the motility and the ulcer score were determined in the same animals, a highly significant relationship was found between these two factors in both sham-operated and adrenalectomized rats. These results suggest that (a) the increased gastric motility may be a key element in the pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced lesions and in the mechanism for aggravation of the lesions and in the mechanism for aggravation of the lesions by adrenalectomy, and (b) abrasion of adrenal glands by inducing hypoglycemia may sensitize the system to indomethacin and increase gastric motility.\r"

Electron microscopy of the fruit has demonstrated lamellar bodies--the same form in which phospholipid is so surface-active in the lung. When administered to intact rats and scored by two methods (ulcer length and area), banana imparted appreciable (75%) protection against acid insult (1 ml of 0.8 N HCl) in a dose-dependent manner not attributable to \"bulking\" or buffering as it was equally effective at a pH of 2. The best protection (89% by ulcer length) was obtained with banana vortexed with milk (1:1), this mixture offering the possibility of a simple foodstuff on which to maintain patients treated acutely by suppressing acid secretion pharmacologically. These studies support Davenport's original concept of a gastric mucosal barrier--but one whose physical reality is provided by an adsorbed layer of surface-active phospholipid (surfactant).\r"

The patterns obtained from fast Fourier transform analysis demonstrated the disappearance of the power peak of approximately 3 cpm after gastrectomy, whereas colectomy did not result in the disappearance of the power peak of approximately 3 and 8-12 cpm. Only the frequencies of approximately 3.5-7.5 cpm were not present after colon surgery. These data demonstrate that the spectral power peaks at frequencies of approximately 3 cpm are entirely related to the stomach because they disappear after gastrectomy; the power peaks between 3.5 and 7.5 cpm are related to the colon because they are present after gastrectomy but not after colectomy; the power peaks between 7.5 and 11 cpm are related to the small intestine because they are present after either gastrectomy or colectomy. The authors conclude that the electrical activity recorded from the abdominal surface and analyzed by fast Fourier transform gives reliable information concerning the electrical activity of the stomach and small intestine, although it is less reliable concerning the electrical activity of the colon.\r"

Substance P/neurokinin A-encoding mRNAs are expressed in neurons within the myenteric plexus of the esophagus and stomach, being more numerous in the latter, and in ganglion cells distributed to both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the intestine. Specificity of the hybridization was demonstrated by the lack of specific signal above background in sections incubated with a sense RNA probe or pretreated with ribonuclease A before hybridization. Ribonucleic acid blot hybridization analysis of RNA extracts from both the muscle layer-myenteric plexus and submucosal layer preparations of the duodenum demonstrated a single band of hybridization at 1.3 kb. Solution hybridization-nuclease protection assays showed multiple preprotachykinin-encoding transcripts in these RNA extracts, with an abundance level of gamma-mRNA greater than beta-mRNA much greater than alpha-mRNA, which is similar to that observed in the rat brain. Our results indicate that the preprotachykinin gene encoding the tachykinin peptides, substance P and neurokinin A, is transcribed in a population of enteric neurons that have a regional distribution comparable to the previously described tachykinin-like immunoreactive neurons, suggesting that specific mRNAs and the posttranslationally processed peptides are localized in the same structures.\r"

There was a vitamin C concentration gradient from gastric juice down to plasma in subjects with normal gastric mucosa, but not in those with chronic gastritis. Patients with chronic gastritis had significantly lower gastric concentrations of vitamin C and ascorbic acid, and ascorbic acid concentrations were especially low in subjects with hypochlorhydria. The presence of the concentration gradient suggests that a mechanism for the secretion of vitamin C into the stomach exists. This is compromised by chronic gastritis. The very low ascorbic acid concentrations in hypochlorhydria may be a consequence of oxidation by bacterial nitrite. Those patients who by the Correa model are at greatest risk for gastric cancer have the lowest gastric levels of ascorbic acid.\r"

In addition, they chose more adjectives to describe their pain and reported more symptoms, especially directly after the injection.

  ".W": "Altered bile acid metabolism has been claimed to play a role in the etiology of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC). Therefore, we studied bile acid metabolism in detail in 10 patients with this syndrome. Pool sizes of both primary bile acids were estimated simultaneously, using deuterated cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. The pool sizes of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, expressed in micromoles per kilogram body weight, were significantly contracted in BRIC patients during a cholestasis-free period: 8.0 +/- 4.2 and 11.7 +/- 4.7, respectively, versus 24.1 +/- 11.7 and 22.9 +/- 7.8 in controls. Fractional turnover rates (per day) for cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid were increased: 0.70 +/- 0.29 and 0.58 +/- 0.27, respectively, versus 0.29 +/- 0.12 and 0.23 +/- 0.10 in controls. Bile acid pool composition expressed as percentages in BRIC patients was cholic acid 34 +/- 17, chenodeoxycholic acid 38 +/- 9, deoxycholic acid 27 +/- 18, and lithocholic acid 1 +/- 1, with a glycine to taurine conjugation ratio of 6.7 +/- 4.9. Corresponding values for 32 controls were cholic acid 57 +/- 13, chenodeoxycholic acid 29 +/- 9, deoxycholic acid 14 +/- 9, and lithocholic acid less than 1, with a glycine to taurine conjugation ratio of 2.4 +/- 1.3. Fecal bile acid loss, in micromoles per kilogram body weight per day, was 11.2 +/- 9.0 in BRIC patients compared with 2.8 +/- 1.4 in controls. The serum 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol level (nanomoles per liter) was significantly increased in BRIC patients: 326 +/- 179 versus 171 +/- 90 in controls. These results suggest that in BRIC patients spillover of bile acids into the colon occurs, which leads to increased fecal bile acid loss and a reduced bile acid pool size. Increased serum 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol is probably indicative of an accelerated bile acid synthesis rate due to increased activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the first step in the major pathway of bile acid synthesis. The results of our study suggest that in BRIC patients a contracted bile acid pool increases the susceptibility of the liver for cholestatic agents.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of aging on ethanol metabolism, 24 male and female F344 rats aged 2 and 12 mo that were fed a laboratory diet received ethanol (1.2 and 2.5 g/kg body wt) intraperitoneally. In male rats, in vivo ethanol elimination significantly decreased according to age both at high (436 +/- 38 vs. 294 +/- 27 mg/kg.h; p less than 0.01) and low (365 +/- 19 vs. 261 +/- 8 mg/kg.h; p less than 0.01) blood ethanol concentrations. Age did not influence the specific activity of hepatic or gastric alcohol dehydrogenase, whereas the activity was significantly decreased with age in the liver (p less than 0.05) and in the stomach (p less than 0.001) when related to body weight. In addition, the activity of the hepatic microsomal ethanol oxidizing system decreased significantly according to age (8.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.00 +/- 0.3 nmol/min.mg micr. protein; p less than 0.001). To study the response of ethanol-metabolizing enzymes to chronic ethanol ingestion, 2- and 19-mo-old male F344 rats were pair-fed nutritionally adequate liquid diets containing 36% of total calories either as ethanol or isocaloric carbohydrate for 3 wk. In this experiment specific alcohol dehydrogenase activity was not significantly affected by age, whereas the hepatic microsomal function estimated by the determination of cytochrome P450, microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, and aniline hydroxylation as well as hepatic mitochondrial low Km-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was found to be markedly depressed with age (p less than 0.01). Chronic ethanol consumption increased microsomal enzyme activities in older rats to levels comparable to those observed in young animals prior to ethanol administration. Chronic ethanol feeding also resulted in an increased hepatic fat accumulation, which was significantly enhanced in older rats. In contrast to male rats, in vivo ethanol metabolism was practically identical for 2- and 12-mo-old female rats. These data demonstrate an enhanced toxicity of alcohol in older compared to younger male but not female rats associated with a delay in alcohol elimination both at high and low ethanol blood concentrations and a decrease in ethanol- and acetaldehyde-metabolizing enzyme activities.\r"

  ".U": "89306420\r", 
  ".W": "Extracorporeal shock-wave cholelithotripsy was carried out in 135 symptomatic patients with radiolucent gallstones, followed by oral bile acid dissolution to assess the resultant stone disappearance rates. Fragmentation was satisfactory (all fragments less than 5 mm in diameter) in 34 patients (25%) after a single session of lithotripsy, and in 65 (48%) after multiple sessions. The overall satisfactory fragmentation rate was significantly higher in patients with single stones less than or equal to 20 mm in diameter when compared with those with larger solitary stones (71% vs. 38%, p less than 0.05), as it also was in all subjects with solitary stones when compared with those with multiple stones (60% vs. 34%, p less than 0.05). After 6, 9, and 12 mo of oral bile acid treatment, the stone-free rates were significantly higher in patients with satisfactory than in those with partial fragmentation (55% vs. 0%, 80% vs. 29%, and 90% vs. 33%, respectively; p less than 0.05). Only 1 of the 7 patients who had previously undergone endoscopic sphincterotomy for concomitant choledocholithiasis was free of stones after 1 yr of dissolution. During dissolution therapy, of the 102 patients in whom fragmentation had occurred, 1 (1%) developed mild acute pancreatitis, 23 (23%) suffered attacks of biliary colic, and 6 (6%) required cholecystectomy. We conclude that the result of fragmentation appears to be a major determinant of the success and rapidity of subsequent oral bile acid dissolution, and that when satisfactory, it allows for complete stone disappearance in most patients within the following year. A comparison of the present results with those of previous original studies suggests that to achieve such satisfactory fragmentation, patients should be selected on the basis of their stone characteristics, which optimally should present as solitary gallbladder calculi less than 20 mm in diameter. Furthermore, real-time ultrasonographic monitoring should be used during lithotripsy with a transducer centered along the shock-wave axis. Despite the innocuousness of the shock waves, the incidence of fragment migration and its possible complications, in our experience, emphasizes the need to restrict at present this nonoperative approach to the treatment of symptomatic gallstone disease.\r"

The stimulus was applied via a probe equipped with bipolar ring electrodes. It was positioned in the middle and distal esophagus at 20 and 37 cm from the incisors, respectively, and sucked to the mucosa. Electrical stimuli (0.1-ms duration, different stimulus voltages) were applied at frequencies of 0.1-1.0 Hz or in randomized order. Cerebral responses to electrical stimulation were recorded after 20-40 stimulations and averaged on a time base of 1000 ms. Evoked potentials consisted of successive peaks and troughs in the averaged electroencephalogram with good reproducibility within and between subjects. Amplitudes of evoked potentials showed a significant reduction with electrical stimulation at 37 cm compared with 20 cm, and with stimulation frequencies of 0.5 and 1.0 Hz compared with 0.2 and 0.1 Hz. Evoked potentials from 37 cm showed longer latencies compared with those from 20 cm. Irregular stimulation and stimulation during mental distraction did not alter these responses. It is concluded that reproducible evoked potentials can be recorded from the scalp after electrical stimulation of the esophagus and that these are transferred centrally via vagal afferents. The technique may become a useful tool in the study of visceral nervous connections to the brain in health and disease.\r"

During that period, research dollars have increased threefold (1.5-fold when corrected for inflation), whereas the number of grants supported by those dollars has increased only 1.5-fold. This increase is similar to that of the entire National Institutes of Health. A greater percentage of grantees now have multiple grants and the cost of multiple grants is greater on a per grant basis. One-half of the funds support the research of only one-fourth of the grantees. The number of competing applications sent to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases compared with those sent to the National Institutes of Health shows a smaller increase (26% vs. 40%), whereas more funds are being provided per grant. Ten of the 12 institutes within the National Institutes of Health are now reporting digestive disease research support, so that total support exceeded $200 million in fiscal year 1986. We conclude that the digestive diseases research community is growing very slowly.\r"

The antimitochondrial autoantibodies recognize four major antigens from beef heart mitochondria at relative molecular weights of 74, 56, 52 and 48 kD. In the present study, we report that the 56 kD antigen is the protein X of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and that it possesses cross-reactive antimitochondrial autoantibody epitope(s) with the 74 kD antigen, the acetyltransferase (E2) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This was demonstrated by comparing the specificities of primary biliary cirrhosis sera with a protein X-specific rabbit antiserum and by absorbing primary biliary cirrhosis sera with recombinant pyruvate dehydrogenase-E2 fusion protein. In the two-dimensional gel analysis, primary biliary cirrhosis sera and protein X-specific rabbit antiserum reacted to the same two isoelectric point polypeptides at 56 kD molecular weight. The absorption of primary biliary cirrhosis sera with the human recombinant pyruvate dehydrogenase-E2 removed reactivity toward both the 74 and 56 kD antigens. Furthermore, analysis of 82 antimitochondrial autoantibody-positive primary biliary cirrhosis sera by immunoblotting did not reveal any sera which reacted solely against either the 74 or 56 kD antigen. Finally, primary biliary cirrhosis sera recognized protein X from human, bovine and porcine sources but not protein X from rat or mouse origin. The identification of protein X as another major target of the autoimmune response in primary biliary cirrhosis suggests that the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex may have a central role in the induction of this enigmatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of calcium in gallstone formation is increasingly recognized. Calcium carbonate is an important constituent of gallbladder stones and may be present in the nidus of cholesterol stones. Secondary deposition of calcium carbonate on the surface of cholesterol gallstones is an important reason for failure of oral bile acid dissolution therapy. We sought to determine the effects of bile acids on the crystallization conditions of calcium carbonate in bile. We studied 18 patients with choledocholithiasis with a percutaneous or endoscopically placed catheter high in the biliary tree. Samples of bile in the basal state and following replacement of the bile acid pool with cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid were analyzed for total calcium, ionized calcium, bicarbonate and carbonate, and the saturation index for calcium carbonate was calculated. Hepatic bile in the basal state was supersaturated with calcium carbonate. Total calcium concentrations rose linearly with rising bile acid concentrations but ionized calcium was maintained in a relatively narrow range. These data are consistent with an important role for bile acids in binding calcium. Extrapolation of the linear regressions between bile acid concentration and calcium concentrations suggested that in the absence of bile acids, biliary calcium concentrations are in passive equilibrium with plasma. Chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid caused a bicarbonate-rich choleresis and significantly augmented the saturation index for calcium carbonate, whereas cholic acid caused no change. In contrast with animal models, the apparent choleretic activity of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid was similar, and no hyper-choleresis was observed with ursodeoxycholic acid. Chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid therefore increase the thermodynamic possibility for calcium carbonate precipitation.\r"

Hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure was induced in rabbits by the intravenous injection of galactosamine. The specific binding of three radiolabeled ligands was assessed densitometrically in several microregions of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. [3H]Muscimol was used to assess gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor density and [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]Ro 15-1788 was used to assess benzodiazepine receptor density. No significant differences were observed between the magnitude of binding of the three ligands to each of the microregions of brain from control rabbits and rabbits in Stage III or IV hepatic encephalopathy. These findings suggest that the behavioral expression of hepatic encephalopathy in the model studied is not dependent upon an increase in the number of gamma-aminobutyric acid or benzodiazepine receptors, but do not conflict with the hypothesis that gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic tone is increased in hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

We have looked for a possible genetic predisposition involving drug oxidation capacity and/or cell defense mechanisms in nine patients with previous amineptine hepatitis. Drug oxidation capacity was assessed using dextromethorphan, a test compound recently proposed as a substitute for debrisoquine. The eight patients tested had the extensive metabolizer phenotype. The susceptibility to amineptine metabolites was studied by an in vitro test assessing the destruction of the patients' lymphocytes by reactive metabolites generated from amineptine by a standardized oxidation microsomal system. Lymphocyte death increased with the dose of amineptine (1 to 2.5 mM); it was increased by preincubation with trichloropropene oxide, but was absent when amineptine was omitted or when the oxidation system was not operating. Mean lymphocyte death was twice higher in the nine patients with amineptine hepatitis than in 17 healthy controls. In contrast, when the test was performed with acetaminophen (3 to 10 mM), lymphocyte death was similar in controls and in patients. Basal epoxide hydrolase activity toward benzo[a]pyrene-4,5-oxide and glutathione concentration was similar in lymphocytes from controls and patients. Family studies showed an increased susceptibility to amineptine metabolites in lymphocytes from several first-degree relatives of two patients. These results show that amineptine hepatitis occurs in patients with extensive dextromethorphan oxidation capacity but with an increased susceptibility to amineptine reactive metabolites, probably related to a genetic deficiency in a cell defense mechanism.\r"

Lea and Leb were found in biliary cells at any level in secretors. In hepatobiliary diseases, A, B and H were neoexpressed in the interlobular bile ducts in addition to their expression in the large and septal bile ducts. Lea and Leb were found in almost all proliferated bile ductules and in some hepatocytes, especially those adjacent to ductules, in any of the hepatobiliary diseases, and their expression seemed parallel to the disease activity. H antigen was also neoexpressed in some hepatocytes and proliferated bile ductules. Extramural peribiliary glands expressed H, Lea, Leb and, to a lesser degree, A and B antigens in normal and pathologic conditions. This study disclosed that the normal biliary tree has a specific expression of blood group antigens at different levels and that this expression is altered in pathologic conditions. Periportal hepatocytes showed neoexpression of blood group antigens in pathologic conditions, and some of these hepatocytes may undergo ductular metaplasia.\r"

Four of the 10 patients had acute hepatitis, and six patients had chronic persistent hepatitis. In seven of 10 patients, a secondary immune defect was apparent due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, leukemia, histiocytosis X, sarcoidosis or end-stage renal disease. Electron microscopy demonstrated that Dane particles from anti-HBc-negative patients were agglutinated after addition of monoclonal anti-HBc antibodies, whereas Dane particles from anti-HBc-positive sera did not show agglutination. Monoclonal HBsAg-specific antibodies aggregated Dane particles independent of the presence of anti-HBc. Circulating HBcAg was always associated with the Dane particle fraction after density gradient separation. Hepatitis B virus core proteins from patients with and without anti-HBc studied by immunoblotting after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis showed identical patterns. Hepatocytes from anti-HBc-negative patients were positive for HBcAg but negative for immunoglobulin G by immunofluorescence technique.

Among seven patients, (six interferon-treated and one control) who lost hepatitis B e antigen from serum, antipyrine clearance improved by 46% (range: 20 to 160%) from 0.37 +/- 0.14 ml per kg per min (mean +/- S.D.) to 0.54 +/- 0.13 ml per kg per min, p less than 0.005. This change paralleled the loss of symptoms and reduction of serum ALT levels (from 206 +/- 189 IU per liter (mean +/- S.D.) to 38 +/- 12 IU per liter, p less than 0.005). Conversely, antipyrine clearance declined to previous levels when reactivation of chronic hepatitis B with reappearance of HBeAg in serum occurred. Regardless of changes in hepatitis B serology, when serum ALT values fluctuated by more than 20% (presumed to reflect fluctuations in necroinflammatory activity of the liver disease), antipyrine clearance also changed whereas serum albumin and bilirubin concentrations and prothrombin time did not. It is concluded that antipyrine clearance is a more sensitive and specific parameter than conventional indices for assessing hepatic metabolic function during changes in chronic hepatitis B disease activity. Remission in disease with loss of HBeAg from serum is associated with improved hepatic metabolic function as determined by the antipyrine clearance test.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-six per cent of 118 young adults observed during a recent measles epidemic had some disturbance on liver function tests. Five per cent developed overt jaundice. Patients treated for fever with paracetamol were found to have significantly higher rates of transaminase impairment compared to those treated with dipyrone. Sixty-five and 58% of patients given paracetamol had elevated ALT and AST levels, respectively. Only 15% of patients given dipyrone had elevated levels of these two enzymes (p less than 0.01 for ALT and p less than 0.02 for AST). The mean levels of transaminases and bilirubin in the paracetamol-treated patients were significantly higher than those found in the dipyrone-treated patients [92 +/- 86 vs. 42 +/- 49 IU (p less than 0.02) for AST and 12 +/- 6.0 vs. 7.0 +/- 2.0 mumoles per liter (p less than 0.01) for bilirubin]. The cumulative dose of paracetamol in those who had impaired liver function was higher than that ingested by patients who did not develop liver damage, although still within the usual therapeutic range [11.6 +/- 5.8 vs. 7.6 +/- 4.2 gm (p = 0.02)]. The possible ways in which measles infection and paracetamol in combination can lead to hepatic damage are discussed.\r"

The effect of galactose content on interaction with hepatoma cells in vitro was studied. Increased galactose content caused increased accumulation of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers by two human hepatoma cell lines (Hep G2 and SAH), but accumulation by rat and mouse hepatoma (HTC and NCTC) was not galactose dependent. Accumulation of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers by Hep G2 was shown to be an active process, being inhibited by low temperature and by the metabolic inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenol. Addition of N-acetylgalactosamine and polymer-galactose to the incubation medium resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of accumulation of galactose-containing polymers. Addition of fucose or galactose was without effect at the concentrations used. Polymers bearing galactosamine or fucosylamine residues and, in addition, daunomycin were evaluated for cytotoxicity against Hep G2 and SAH. N-(2-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer-bound daunomycin produced a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis (measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine), and the galactose-containing polymer showed greatest inhibition.\r"

All liver tissue chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus contained various amounts of episomal and replicative forms of woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA: episomal and replicative forms of woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA without integration were found in six tumors, episomal and integrated woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA was observed in 18 tumors and exclusively integrated woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA was found in two tumors. In most tumors and in all of the liver tissues chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus, two major woodchuck hepatitis virus RNA species (3.7 and 2.1 kilobases) were detected. In tumors of two other animals (HW76 and HW89) with integrated woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA, only single major transcripts of 3.5 and 2.5 kilobases, respectively, were detected. Hybridization with subcloned woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA probes showed that both aberrant transcripts lacked the C gene and a part of the pre-S1 gene; characterization of corresponding integrated woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA sequences revealed that the C gene was deleted in one tumor, although not in the other. In agreement with the nucleic acid data, we found expression of core protein by Western blotting only in chronically infected liver tissue of these animals, but not in the corresponding tumors. Deletion of the C gene in mRNA may be due to deletion of this gene in the integrated sequences or due to transcriptional regulation.\r"

The present study was undertaken in 34 patients, to evaluate residual creatinine clearances (CCr) before the start of haemodialysis and after 3, 12 and 24 months. CCr progressively declined from 6.15 +/- 2.61 (before) to 1.40 +/- 1.29 ml.min-1 (after 24 months: p less than 0.01). The decrease was largest during the first three months of dialysis therapy (slope -0.99 +/- 1.01 ml.min-1.month-1 for the first three months vs. -0.23 +/- 0.12 ml.min-1.month-1 for the entire 24-month period: p less than 0.01). The decline in CCr during the first three months was significantly more pronounced in glomerular disease than in tubulo-interstitial disease (p less than 0.05). This could not be attributed to differences in blood pressure, body weight or hypotensive medications. Age and sex also had no influence. Our data indicate that there is a characteristic progressive loss of renal function in haemodialyzed patients and that the early decline is most pronounced in patients with glomerular disease. Regular assessment of residual renal function at least every three months is indicated in patients starting chronic haemodialysis treatment.\r"

An increased prevalence of septicemic shock with its inevitable high risk of morbidity and mortality was striking. Timely termination of CAPD and change over to hemodialysis may help to prevent dissemination of infection in these patients. Among the vascular causes of death in CAPD patients, bowel infarction seemed to be the most common.\r"

Although RDW failed to correlate with conventional tests of iron status, it was observed that iron administration could produce a decrease toward normal in RDW and a parallel increase in haemoglobin when the initial RDW was increased. In contrast, the response to iron was negligible in the patients with normal RDW basally. It was concluded that high RDW is an acceptable indicator of iron deficiency in haemodialysis patients.\r"

These patients were later divided into three groups: the first group with ventricular septal perforation, the second with aorto-coronary bypass grafting (ACBG) before LVAD implantation and the third group without ACBG. LVAD maintained the systemic circulation in each group, and cardiac function recovered enough to remove LVAD in 70% of the total patients. Two of three patients in the first group were discharged from hospital. Two weaned cases in the second group died of multiple organ failure and one was discharged, and hemorrhagic necrosis was seen in the bypassed area of the myocardium. One patient of the third group could not be weaned from LVAD because of respiratory failure though his heart function began to recover. Another case in the third group underwent bypass grafting after removal of LVAD. However ACBG surgery should be done very carefully because a patient in shock is occasionally intolerant to major surgery. In all groups, the major cause of death was multiple organ failure which was probably caused by the prolonged low output condition prior to LVAD application. In the light of this experience, it appears that LVAD should be applied before irreversible damage occurs to major organs, including the heart itself. To ensure the timely application of LVAD, some way must be found to introduce systematic application of LVAD into the normal course of AMI treatment.\r"

Yet suitable techniques for characterizing the surface chemistry of soft and flexible biomaterials with an uneven surface contour such as those used in vascular prostheses have only recently been made available. As a first step towards determining the effect of surface contaminants on the healing behaviour of vascular prostheses, this study used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to characterize the surface chemistry of 14 virgin polyester arterial prostheses from a wide variety of sources. Generally speaking, all surfaces appeared relatively clean. However, the results indicate that certain prostheses were not manufactured with Dacron-like fibres, and that some exhibit significantly carbon-rich surfaces. This suggests that the surface of these devices has been modified either by a hydrocarbon lubricant or by vapour phase hydrocarbons during fabrication.\r"

The distribution of pore diameters is more limited in the microporous glass membranes than in currently utilized synthetic polymer membranes. The filtration resistance of the concentration polarization layer is the dominant factor in plasma fractionation. Proteins are separated more sharply with a higher wall shear rate because of destruction of the concentration polarization layer formed on membrane surfaces. Plasma fractionation using a microporous glass membrane with a pore diameter of 15 nm may allow separation of albumin and IgG at higher wall shear rates. Cascade filtration techniques using microporous glass membranes with various pore diameters may be suitable for plasma fractionation.\r"

The hyperperfusion involved not only cerebral cortex but also subcortical structures including thalamus, basal ganglia, and subcortical white matter. LCBF increases were not bilateral and sometimes asymmetrical, but LCBF increases were not consistently related to the preponderant side of headache. No significant differences were observed in the degree or pattern of cerebral hyperperfusion during headaches compared among common (N = 6) and classic (N = 6) migraineurs. Results suggest a common etiology for both common and classic migraine. Results are not consistent with spreading oligemia or spreading cortical depression as a cause of migraine. The cerebral hyperperfusion appears to be mediated by various neurogenic and chemical changes accompanying migraine. The unilateral nature of migraine head pain is more likely due to dilation of extracranial vessels.\r"

Eighty-one patients (39 in the experimental group, 42 in the control group) who participated in a prior study on the effect of a nursing intervention on regimen compliance, completed scales that assessed attitudes toward regimen prescriptions (diet, medications, activity, smoking, and stress response), perceived beliefs of others concerning compliance, personal adjustments, and regimen compliance. At 1 year, no differences were found between experimental and control groups for regimen compliance or personal adjustments. There was a significant decrease in mean scores for all variables from the time the patient was in the hospital to 30 days afterward, but no change at 1 year from the 30- or 60-day visit. At 1 year, attitudes were predictive of compliance for all regimen prescriptions. Perceived beliefs of others were predictive of diet, activity, and medication prescriptions.\r"

In-depth interviews with eight experienced ICU nurses and participant observation were used to collect data. Three distinct kinds of touch were identified, as well as normative patterns of touch among ICU nurses. The findings indicate that an understanding of touch is predicated on knowledge about the structural components of touch and the contextual variables and conditions that determine norms of touching. Touch is described as a multipurpose nursing strategy in the ICU. A need was identified to study a wider range of potential therapeutic and nontherapeutic touch meanings for nurses and patients than has previously been reported.\r"

Nurses are often unaware of the magnitude of the sleep disturbance because of a lack of reliable, valid and feasible measures to assess sleep patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability and validity of a sleep perception tool and a sleep observation instrument for the trauma patient in a critical care setting. The research investigated the relationships among the measures of observed sleep, patient perception of sleep, and polysomnograph sleep data on the sleep traits: sleep latency, midsleep awakening, and wake after sleep onset. A purposive sample of 20 patients with multisystem trauma participated in this descriptive correlational study. Instruments used to measure sleep for one night were the Dynograph R-511A, the Patient's Sleep Behavior Observational Tool, and the Verran/Snyder Halpern Sleep Scale. Results of the multitrait-multimethod analysis revealed that observed wake after sleep onset met all the criteria for convergent and discriminant validity, with perceived awakenings demonstrating convergent validity alone with polysomnographic awakenings lasting longer than 4 minutes. All sleep variables were reliable. It is concluded that nursing observation of trauma patients' wakefulness can be used to test sleep-promoting interventions.\r"

Intracranial pressure was measured with the patient in four different positions: head at 0 degrees, head down 30 degrees, three fourths supine, and three fourths prone without turning the head. Intracranial pressure results were as follows: at 0 degrees, 20.50 +/- 1.75 (mean +/- SEM) mm Hg; head down 30 degrees, 24.15 +/- 1.75 mm Hg; three fourths supine, 28.83 +/- 2.69 mm Hg; and three fourths prone 30.85 +/- 2.90 mm Hg. Intracranial pressures were higher in the latter three positions as compared with the standard 0 degrees supine position, but some individual differences in response were noted. The data suggest that the head-down, three-fourths supine, and three-fourths prone positions have a greater chance of increasing the intracranial pressure in patients with severe head injury having prolonged comas. When patients are placed in the above three postures the duration should be as short as possible, and they should be used only when absolutely necessary.\r"

Methacholine (10(-6) M) induced rapid increases in isometric force and in phosphorylation of the 20,000-Da myosin light chain. Myosin phosphorylation remained elevated during steady-state maintenance of isometric force. The shortening velocity peaked at 15 s after stimulation with methacholine and then declined to approximately 45% of the maximal value by 3 min. Isoproterenol pretreatment inhibited methacholine-stimulated myosin light chain phosphorylation, shortening velocity, and force during the early stages of force generation. However, the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol on force and myosin phosphorylation is proportionally greater than that on shortening velocity. Isoproterenol pretreatment also caused a rightward non-parallel shift in the methacholine dose-response curves for both isometric tension and myosin light chain phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that isoproterenol attenuates the contractile properties of airway smooth muscles by affecting the rate and extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation, perhaps through a mechanism that involves the synergistic interaction of myosin light chain kinase phosphorylation and Ca2+ metabolism.\r"

VO2 differences between starting and arriving levels were 20-60% VO2 max. In C, the VO2 on-response became monotonically slower with increasing VO2 s, the half time (t1/2) increasing from approximately 22 s for VO2 s = R to approximately 63 s when VO2 s approximately equal to 50% VO2 max. In S, the fastest VO2 kinetics (t1/2 = 16 s) was attained from VO2 s = 15-30% VO2 max, the t1/2 being approximately 25 s when starting from R or from 50% VO2 max. The slower VO2 kinetics in C were associated with a much larger delta Lab. The VO2 kinetics in recovery were essentially the same in all cases and could be approximated by a double exponential with t1/2 of 21.3 +/- 6 and 93 +/- 45 s for the fast and slow components, respectively. It is concluded that the O2 deficit incurred is the sum of three terms: 1) O2 stores depletion, 2) O2 equivalent of early lactate production, and 3) O2 equivalent of phosphocreatine breakdown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inhalation of cigarette smoke into the lower airway via a tracheostomy evokes immediate apnea, bradycardia, and systemic hypotension in dogs. These responses can still be evoked when conduction in myelinated vagal fibers is blocked preferentially by cooling but are abolished by vagotomy, suggesting that they are mediated by afferent vagal C-fibers. To examine this possibility, we recorded impulses in pulmonary C-fibers in anesthetized, open-chest dogs and delivered 120 ml cigarette smoke to the lungs in a single ventilatory cycle. Pulmonary C-fibers were stimulated within 1 or 2 s of the delivery of smoke generated by high-nicotine cigarettes, activity increasing from 0.3 +/- 0.1 to a peak of 12.6 +/- 1.3 (SE) impulses/s, (n = 60); the evoked discharge usually lasted 3-5 s. Smoke generated by low-nicotine cigarettes evoked a milder stimulation in 33% of pulmonary C-fibers but did not significantly affect the overall firing frequency (peak activity = 2.2 +/- 1.1 impulses/s, n = 36). Hexamethonium (0.7-1.2 mg/kg iv) prevented C-fiber stimulation by high-nicotine cigarette smoke (n = 12) but not stimulation by right atrial injection of capsaicin. We conclude that pulmonary C-fibers are stimulated by a single breath of cigarette smoke and that nicotine is the constituent responsible.\r"

We tested four surface-active agents (Tween 20, a detergent; and FC-100, FC-430, and FC-431, industrial fluorocarbons), all lacking these properties, for their ability to increase pulmonary compliance in surfactant-deficient premature rabbits. Fetal rabbits were delivered by cesarean section at 27 days (full term = 31 days) and injected via tracheostomy with 50% lactated Ringer solution, adult rabbit surfactant, or one of the four experimental agents. Dynamic compliance was measured using 1 h of mechanical ventilation followed by alveolar lavage. Each experimental agent produced a dynamic compliance significantly higher than 50% lactated Ringer solution and statistically equal to or greater than natural surfactant. Equilibrium surface tension of the agents and minimum and equilibrium surface tension of the alveolar washes each correlated with compliance (P less than 0.05). This suggests that some surface properties of pulmonary surfactant believed to be essential are not, although surface tension does seem to play a role in pulmonary compliance.\r"

We hypothesized that the mechanism actually limiting tasks in which these parameters were varied involved the rate of energy utilization by the inspiratory muscles. To test this hypothesis, we studied four experienced normal subjects during fatiguing breathing tasks performed over a range of pressures and flows and at two different lung volumes. We assessed energy utilization by measuring the increment in the rate of whole body O2 consumption due to the breathing task (VO2 resp). Power and mean esophageal pressure correlated with Tlim but depended also on lung volume and inspiratory flow rate. In contrast, VO2 resp closely correlated with Tlim, and this relationship was not systematically altered by inspiratory flow or lung volume. The shape of the VO2 resp vs. Tlim curve was approximately hyperbolic, with high rates of VO2 resp associated with short endurance times and lower rates of VO2 resp approaching an asymptotic value at high Tlim. These findings are consistent with a mechanism whereby a critical rate of energy utilization determines the endurance of the inspiratory pump, and that rate varies with pressure, flow, and lung volume.\r"

Initial uptake rates (clearances) in skin, skeletal muscles, diaphragm, and heart (left ventricle) were measured over 1 h. BSA labeled with 125I was injected terminally to correct for intravascular 131I-BSA. Observed clearances were in the following order in both groups of animals: heart much greater than diaphragm approximately equal to skin greater than resting skeletal muscles. Differences between unanesthetized and anesthetized animals were small and inconsistently directed. Our results suggest that the lower albumin clearances reported in the literature for anesthetized rats are not the result of their immobility or any direct effect of anesthesia on albumin transport in these tissues. The lower transport rates appear to result indirectly from changes produced by anesthesia and/or surgery in controllable parameters such as plasma volume and intravascular protein mass.\r"

  ".W": "Five mongrel dogs (2 interstitial and 3 alveolar edema) were studied. Lung mechanics were measured by recording the flow, volume, and esophageal pressure according to the standard technique. Edema was produced by infusion of Ringer lactate solution. Lung sounds were recorded on tape from the dependent part of the chest wall. Lung sound signals were high-pass filtered at 100 Hz and subjected to fast Fourier transform. Samples of lung sounds were analyzed before (control) and at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min after the infusion. The mean, median, and mode frequencies of sound power spectra at the control time were, respectively, 169.6 +/- 29.19, 129.6 +/- 29.81, and 136.0 +/- 29.87 (SD) Hz. These values increased significantly at 5 min after infusion to 194.0 +/- 26.08 (P less than 0.0037), 150.2 +/- 23.48 (P less than 0.0085), and 164.6 +/- 28.74 Hz (P less than 0.02), respectively. These values stayed significantly elevated at 10, 20, 30, and 40 min. The pulmonary wedge pressure, lung dynamic compliance, and pulmonary resistance were measured also at the same times. The mean, median, and mode frequencies correlated with pulmonary wedge pressure (P less than 0.00001, P less than 0.0001, P less than 0.0001), lung dynamic compliance (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.0001, P less than 0.0001), and pulmonary resistance (P less than 0.00001, P less than 0.00001, P less than 0.0001), respectively. There were no significant adventitious sounds up to 40 and 50 min after infusion. We concluded that pulmonary congestion and early edema alter the frequency characteristics of lung sounds early, before the occurrence of adventitious sounds. These altered lung sounds may be used as an index of pulmonary congestion and impending edema.\r"

Capillaries are known to be recruited during conditions that raise pulmonary blood flow and pressure. To determine whether pulmonary arterioles and venules are part of the recruitment process, we made in vivo microscopic observations of the subpleural microcirculation (all vessels less than 100 microns) in the upper lung where blood flow is low (zone 2). To evoke recruitment, pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated either by an intravascular fluid load or by airway hypoxia. Of 209 arteriolar segments compared during low and high pulmonary arterial pressures, none recruited or derecruited. Elevated arterial pressure, however, did increase the number of perfused capillary segments by 96% with hypoxia and 165% with fluid load. Recruitment was essentially absent in venules (4 cases of recruitment in 289 segments as pressure was raised). These data support the concept that recruitment in the pulmonary circulation is exclusively a capillary event.\r"

The tissues were placed in organ baths containing physiological salt solution and stimulated at 8-Hz frequency, 0.5-ms pulse duration, and 30 V (approximately 100 mA) for 5 s. Electrical field stimulation evoked a biphasic contraction of bronchial muscle, consisting of an initial contraction followed by a sustained contraction, which was mediated by intramural cholinergic and noncholinergic nerve stimulations, respectively. Adenosine, at concentrations greater than M, caused a concentration-dependent inhibition in the height of the noncholinergically mediated contraction, accompanied by a very weak inhibition on the cholinergically mediated response. ATP (10(-5) to 3 x 10(-3) M) also produced a similar inhibitory effect on the noncholinergically mediated contraction, but the inhibitory potency was less than that of adenosine. The inhibitory response to adenosine was enhanced by the pretreatment with dipyridamole (2 x 10(-6) M) but antagonized with aminophylline (10(-5) M). Contractions of bronchial muscle evoked by exogenous acetylcholine (2 x 10(-6) M) or substance P (2 x 10(-7) M) were significantly inhibited by the adenosine (3 x 10(-4) M) pretreatment. These data suggest that in isolated guinea pig bronchi adenosine selectively inhibits noncholinergic neurotransmission through prejunctional P1-purinoceptors.\r"

Costal and crural electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded in decerebrate spontaneously breathing cats. Hypercapnia and hypoxia resulted in significant increases in peak integrated costal, crural, and whole phrenic nerve activities when the vagi were either intact or cut. However, there were no consistent differences between costal and crural neural responses. Left crural EMG activity was increased significantly more than left costal EMG activity in response to hypercapnia and hypoxia. These results indicate that the central neural inputs to costal and crural portions of the diaphragm are similar in eupnea and in response to chemical and mechanical feedback in decerebrate paralyzed cats. The observed differences in EMG activities in spontaneously breathing animals must arise from modulation of central respiratory activity by mechanoreceptor feedback from respiratory muscles, likely the diaphragm itself.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiovascular, metabolic, and thermoregulatory responses were studied in eight male miniature swine during a prolonged treadmill run. Each animal underwent 8-10 wk of exercise training, thoracic surgery, and 3 wk of retraining before the experimental run. This regimen enabled the animals to run at 65% of the heart rate range (210-220 beats/min) for approximately 100 min. Skin wetting and a fan were used to cool the pigs during the run. Regional blood flow was significantly altered with the onset of exercise; however, hindlimb muscle and total gastrointestinal blood flow were unchanged throughout the exercise period. Compared with 5-min values, heart rate and cardiac output were significantly elevated by 17 beats/min and 31 ml.min-1.kg-1 at 60 min and by 20 beats/min and 33 ml.min-1.kg-1 at end exercise, respectively. Core temperatures increased between 5 and 30 min of exercise (39.4 vs. 39.9 degrees C) but then remained unchanged to the end of exercise. Mean arterial pressure, O2 consumption, and blood lactate did not change during the exercise bout. These data indicate that limiting increases in core temperature during prolonged exercise was associated with a plateau in active muscle blood flow.\r"

After exposure to either smoke or room air, guinea pigs were anesthetized and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-D, mol wt 10,000) was aerosolized into their lungs. Blood samples taken through a carotid arterial cannula were analyzed by gel chromatography and spectrofluorometry for the presence of FITC-D. The results confirmed that, after smoke exposure, increased amounts of intact FITC-D molecules with a reported Einstein-Stokes radius of 22.2 A crossed the respiratory epithelium into the vascular space. Transmission electron-microscopic studies showed that the FITC-D diffused across damaged type I pneumocyte membranes and cytoplasm to reach the basal lamina and entered the alveolar capillaries through endothelial tight junctions. Damage to the alveolar epithelium was more frequent for the smoke-exposed animals than the room air-exposed animals (P less than 0.05). We conclude that smoke exposure damages type I cells and that inhaled FITC-D crosses the epithelial barrier at damaged type I cells of the bronchioloalveolar junctions.\r"

The preparations were subjected to reductions in TO2 by progressively decreasing partial pressure of arterial O2 (PaO2). At each level of PaO2 we obtained simultaneous measures of arterial and venous blood gases, venous lactate concentration, and changes in the relative concentrations of inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine, and ATP measured with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ratio of the change in vascular resistance (R) to the corresponding decrease in TO2 was taken as an index of vascular autoregulation with hypoxemia. Linear and logarithmic functions were fitted by least squares to the TO2-VO2 data from each experiment. TO2-VO2 relationships were characterized as O2 conforming (linear function, n = 4) or O2 regulating (logarithmic function, n = 4), depending on the goodness of fit. Those preparations showing an O2-conforming pattern had higher control VO2 (2.42 +/- 0.14 vs. 1.66 +/- 0.19 ml.min-1.kg-1; P less than 0.05) and a lesser degree of vascular autoregulation (0.07 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.02; P less than 0.01) than the O2-regulating group. Decreases in VO2 were always accompanied by increases in inorganic phosphate and lactate and decreases in phosphocreatine, indicating O2 supply limitation and anaerobic ATP production. There was no evidence of cellular adaptation to hypoxia by decreasing energy needs or of VO2 limitation by the depletion of adenine nucleotides.\r"

Significant differences were found, however, in the response of the pupils to both phenylephrine and carbachol. Heterozygotes for CF have more reactive pupils; i.e., they require smaller doses of agonist for a 10% change in pupil size. In control subjects, the response of the pupils to phenylephrine and carbachol is highly correlated (r = 0.45, P less than 0.001), whereas in CF heterozygotes, the correlation is not significantly different from zero (r = -0.02). In controls, the pupil response to carbachol has a significant negative correlation with cold air response (r = 0.39, P less than 0.05), indicating that those whose pupils were most sensitive to carbachol had the greatest airway reactivity to cold air, but in CF heterozygotes the correlation is not significant (r = 0.10).

Control ASL was hyperosmolar (342 +/- 2.8 mosmol/kg) compared with ferret plasma and surrounding buffer. Higher values were also found for sodium (167 +/- 1.7 mmol/l), potassium (9.0 +/- 0.05 mmol/l), total calcium (3.46 +/- 0.11 mmol/l), and ionized calcium (2.55 +/- 0.18 mmol/l). pH was lower (7.12 +/- 0.03) than in plasma or buffer. Addition of methacholine to the surrounding buffer increased flow of ASL and potential difference across the mucosa and lowered pH, calcium, sodium, and chloride concentrations. Potassium concentration was increased. Phenylephrine increased flow and decreased calcium concentrations. Salbutamol (albuterol) had no effect on flow but decreased pH and increased calcium and potassium concentrations. Histamine increased flow and calcium concentrations and decreased pH. These changes are presumably due to changes in gland secretion and epithelial transport. Methacholine and phenylephrine increased the sugar content of the secretions, the changes with phenylephrine being larger. Thus resting ASL is hyperosmolar and relatively acid, with high cation contents, and administration of drugs changes its composition by actions on submucosal glands and epithelium.\r"

The animals were ventilated using a constant-flow ventilator, and the conductance and compliance of the respiratory system were continuously monitored. We found that reactivity to histamine infusion was less in newborns than in adults, because newborns required a larger dose of histamine than adults (300 vs. 125 ng.kg-1.s-1) to produce an equivalent decrease in conductance (42 +/- 13 vs. 42 +/- 15%). Vagal interruption by bilateral cervical vagotomy or muscarinic blockade with atropine (3 mg/kg) significantly reduced the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine in adults. By contrast, neither vagotomy nor atropine significantly changed this response in the newborns. These results indicate the lack of a vagal component in the bronchoconstriction that histamine induced in the newborns. Their relative unresponsiveness to histamine might partly be related to the fact that, in the newborn, histamine mainly acts directly via its airway receptors.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that hyaline membrane disease (HMD) has a multifactorial etiology in which barotrauma plays a major role, we compared the immediate institution of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV; 15 Hz, n = 5) with positive-pressure ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PPV; n = 7) in premature baboons (140-days gestation) with HMD. Measurements of ventilation settings and physiological parameters were obtained and arterial-to-alveolar O2 (PaO2-to-PAO2) ratio and oxygenation index [(PaO2/PAO2)-to-mean airway pressure ratio (IO2)] were calculated. At death (24 h), static pressure-volume (PV) curves were performed, and phospholipids (PL) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) were measured in lung lavage fluid. Morphological inflation patterns were analyzed using a panel of standards. By design, mean airway pressure was initially higher (19 vs. 13 cmH2O) in the HFOV animals. PaO2-to-PAO2 ratio and IO2 progressively deteriorated in the PPV animals and then stabilized at significantly lower levels than with HFOV. PV curves from HFOV animals had significant increases in lung volume at maximum distending pressure, deflation volume at 10 cmH2O, and hysteresis area compared with PPV, which showed no hysteresis. Seven of seven PPV and only one of five HFOV animals had morphological findings of HMD. PL amount and composition in both groups were consistent with immaturity, even though the quantity was significantly greater in the PPV group. PAF was present (greater than or equal to 0.10 pmol) in six of seven PPV and in the only HFOV animal with HMD. We conclude that HFOV protected PL-deficient premature baboons from changes in gas exchange, lung mechanics, and morphology typical of HMD in this model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The internal layer, consisting of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis, shortened more in expiration than the external layer, consisting of the external oblique and rectus abdominis. The internal oblique shortened to approximately 83% of its length at functional residual capacity vs. 98% for the external oblique (P less than 0.05). The results obtained during passive lung inflation indicate these internal muscles are also more influenced by changes in lung volume. The internal oblique lengthened to 115% of its length at functional residual capacity vs. 103% for external oblique at total lung capacity (P less than 0.05). The results suggest that anatomic division of the abdominal muscles into external and internal layers corresponds to functional differences in terms of both passive lengthening and active shortening during ventilation and that these differences imply variable functions of the two layers.\r"

Fatigue resistance of the diaphragm was measured by means of an in vitro nerve-muscle strip preparation. Fiber SDH activity and cross-sectional area were quantified by means of an image processing system. Diaphragm fatigue resistance was significantly improved in the nutritionally deprived (ND) group. In both muscles, nutritional deprivation resulted in a significant decrease in fiber cross-sectional area (both type I and II), type II fibers showing greater atrophy. The SDH activities of type I and II fibers in the diaphragm were not affected by nutritional deprivation. This contrasted with a significant decrease in the SDH activity of both type I and II fibers in the MGr of ND animals. An assessment of the interrelationships between fiber atrophy and fiber SDH activity revealed a greater effect of malnutrition on those diaphragm type II fibers that had the lowest relative SDH activities and the largest cross-sectional areas. By comparison, the effect of malnutrition on type I and II fibers in the MGr was nonselective with regard to fiber SDH activity. We conclude that the enhanced diaphragm fatigue resistance in the ND animals does not result from an increase in the oxidative capacity of muscle fibers and is best explained by the pattern of diaphragm muscle fiber atrophy.\r"

After external gas exchange, blood was returned at constant flow (approximately 120 ml.min-1.kg-1) directly to the aorta or indirectly through the left heart (\"left heart loading\"). Loading caused breathing frequency (f) to increase approximately 5 breaths/min (approximately 20%), whereas systemic arterial pressure (Psa) fell approximately 15%. Because Psa was pulsatile during loading, we demonstrated separately the effect of pulsatile pressure and found it to lower mean Psa without changing f. Cooling cervical vagi to 7 degrees C eliminated the f response to loading and slightly decreased the Psa response. Loading was compared with graded distension of the fibrillating ventricle and beating atrium, which also increased f. As measured by an abdominal pneumograph, depth of breathing decreased significantly (approximately 4%) during left heart loading but did not change significantly on distension of the fibrillating heart. I conclude that left heart loading may induce tachypnea and a slightly reduced tidal volume by a vagal reflex most likely originating from the left heart.\r"

A population of fibers in the fast-twitch superficial region of the dy2J gastrocnemius stores unusually high amounts of glycogen, leading to an increased glycogen storage in the whole muscle. The dy2J muscle also contains twice as much lactate as normal muscle. A [14C]lactate intraperitoneal injection leads to preferential 14C incorporation into glycogen in the dy2J muscle compared with normal muscle. To determine whether skeletal muscles were incorporating lactate into glycogen without body organ (liver, kidney) input, gastrocnemius muscles were bathed in 10 mM [14C]lactate with intact neural and arterial supply but with impeded venous return. The contralateral gastrocnemius serves as a control for body organ input. By using this in situ procedure, we demonstrate that under conditions of high lactate both normal and dy2J muscle can directly synthesize glycogen from lactate. In this case, normal whole muscle incorporates [14C] lactate into glycogen at a higher rate than dy2J whole muscle. Autoradiography, however, suggests that the high-glycogen-containing muscle fibers in the dy2J muscle incorporate lactate into glycogen at nearly four times the rate of normal or surrounding muscle fibers.\r"

However, studies in five normal subjects suggested that calf blood flow measured with a plethysmograph was less than arterial inflow calculated from Doppler velocity measurements. We hypothesized that the pressure required for venous occlusion may have decreased arterial velocity. Further studies revealed that systolic diameter of the superficial femoral artery under a thigh cuff decreased from 7.7 +/- 0.4 to 5.6 +/- 0.7 mm (P less than 0.05) when the inflation pressure was increased from 0 to 40 mmHg. Cuff inflation to 40 mmHg also reduced mean velocity 38% in the common femoral artery and 47% in the popliteal artery. Inflation of a cuff on the arm reduced mean velocity in the radial artery 22% at 20 mmHg, 26% at 40 mmHg, and 33% at 60 mmHg. We conclude that inflation of a cuff on an extremity to low pressures for venous occlusion also caused a reduction in arterial diameter and flow velocity.\r"

  ".W": "We studied flutter in collapsible tubes as a possible mechanism for the generation of respiratory wheezes. The pressure-flow relationships and the wall oscillations of thick-walled [wall thickness (h)-to-lumen radius (r) ratio 1:1.7 to 1.3] self-supporting latex and Silastic tubes mounted between rigid pipes were measured. A high-impedance vacuum pump was connected to the downstream end. Upstream and downstream valves were used to control corresponding resistances. We found loud honking sounds and tube wall oscillations that occurred only when the tubes were buckled and flow limiting, i.e., when the flow became constant and independent of downstream driving pressure. The overall range of oscillatory frequencies was 260-750 Hz for airflow, presenting as sharp peaks of power on the frequency spectrum. The oscillatory frequencies (f) were higher at higher fluid velocities (u) and with narrower distance between opposing flattened walls (2b), resulting from increasing downstream suction pressure and the transmural pressure becoming more negative. The effect of u and b on f for a latex tube (h-to-r ratio 1:1.7) were found to be f = 228 + 0.021 (u/b). These relationships were valid throughout the range of oscillations in this tube (283-720 Hz) and with flow rates of 12-64 l/min. The experimental data were compared with predictions of the fluid dynamic flutter theory and the vortex-induced wall vibrations mechanism. We conclude that viscid flutter in soft tubes is the more probable mechanism for the generation of oscillations in the soft tube model and is a possible mechanism for the generation of respiratory wheezes.\r"

  ".W": "A mathematical analysis of flow through a flexible channel is examined as a model of flow-induced flutter oscillations that pertain to the production of wheezing breath sounds. The model provides predictions for the critical fluid speed that will initiate flutter waves of the wall, as well as their frequency and wavelength. The mathematical results are separated into linear theory (small oscillations) and nonlinear theory (larger oscillations). Linear theory determines the onset of the flutter, whereas nonlinear theory determines the relationships between the fluid speed and both the wave amplitudes and frequencies. The linear theory predictions correlate well with data taken at the onset of flutter and flow limitation during experiments of airflow in thick-walled collapsible tubes. The nonlinear theory predictions correlate well with data taken as these flows are forced to higher velocities while keeping the flow rate constant. Particular ranges of the parameters are selected to investigate and discuss the applications to airway flows. According to this theory, the mechanism of generation of wheezes is based in the interactions of fluid forces and friction and wall elastic-restoring forces and damping. In particular, a phase delay between the fluid pressure and wall motion is necessary. The wave speed theory of flow limitation is discussed with respect to the specific data and the flutter model.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the contradictory statements published about the influence of the shunt properties of the upper airway on the measurements of the respiratory impedence by means of the forced oscillation technique, this influence has been reevaluated. In healthy adults and children and in patients with obstructive lung disease, the total respiratory impedance was measured by applying oscillations at the mouth (conventional technique) or around the head (head generator technique), with the cheeks either supported by the hands or not. In healthy adults the two techniques (conventional cheeks supported and head generator) yield similar results for respiratory resistance (Rrs) and a more pronounced increase of respiratory reactance (Xrs) with frequency with the head generator. In children and in patients with moderate airway obstruction, the negative frequency dependence of Rrs observed with the conventional technique tends to disappear with the head generator. This is not observed in patients with severe airway obstruction. The differences between the two techniques can be explained by the influence of the shunt impedance of the upper airway on Rrs and Xrs. Correction for this influence by subtracting the impedance measured during a Valsalva maneuver is not satisfactory, since the Valsalva maneuver itself modifies the upper airway shunt. The head generator technique reduces the influence of the upper airway shunt but does not suppress it altogether; the residual error is small, however.\r"

Significant increase with hypoxia occurred in the levels of BLP in the plasma and CSF and of BELI and ABE in the plasma of the young group. In the older group, such increases occurred in ABE levels of the dmscNTS, in BLP and ABE levels of the CSF, and in plasma BELI. Estimated levels of pure beta-endorphin were higher in the CSF of young piglets during both control and hypoxia. With hypoxia, these estimated levels increased significantly in the plasma of the young age group but showed only a borderline increase in the old group. It is possible that higher opioid levels in the CSF of young as compared with older neonates, enhanced by a greater opioid increase in their plasma during hypoxia, may help explain the suppressed respiratory response to hypoxia of the newborn.\r"

To assess the mechanism of this expiratory muscle shortening, we have measured the electromyogram and the respiratory changes in length of the canine triangularis sterni in the third and fourth right intercostal space, first before and then after selective denervation. Eleven anesthetized, spontaneously breathing animals were studied in the supine posture; five of them were also studied during postural changes from supine to head-up. Before denervation, the muscle in the supine animals shortened by -12.84 +/- 1.81% Lr. With selective denervation, the amount of expiratory muscle shortening was reduced to only -2.54 +/- 0.71% Lr (P less than 0.001). Similarly, a change from the supine to the head-up posture before denervation promoted an increase in expiratory muscle shortening from -13.58 +/- 3.62 to -21.17 +/- 4.04% Lr (P less than 0.005), but the denervation abolished this increase. Denervating the triangularis sterni, however, did not affect expiratory activation of the internal intercostals. These results demonstrate that the expiratory contraction of the canine triangularis sterni is agonistic in nature, and they suggest that this contraction is responsible for most of the active caudal displacement of the ribs in the upper half of the rib cage.\r"

Compared with normal subjects, asthmatics demonstrated 1) significantly higher BAL concentrations of histamine, total protein, the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes (SRS-A), and leukotiene B4; 2) a decrease in specific airway conductance (sGaw) with a DI at base line vs. an increase in normal subjects (before vs. after percent change in sGaw, -10 vs. 12, P less than 0.05); and 3) no significant difference in BAL total cell count or leukocyte differential. Significant correlations were demonstrated between 1) percent of BAL eosinophils vs. degree of airway hyperresponsiveness; 2) base-line level of airway obstruction vs. degree of hyperresponsiveness; 3) effects of a DI vs. BAL concentrations of eosinophils, total protein, and histamine; 4) base-line forced expired volume in 1 s vs. BAL concentrations of total protein and histamine; and 5) BAL concentrations of the various mediators with each other. These data support the notion that 1) the response to a DI in mild, stable asthmatics represents a physiological indicator of peripheral obstruction because of inflammation and 2) this inflammation is associated with increases in several known mediators of airway inflammation and hyperreactivity.\r"

We measured transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), systemic arterial and phrenic venous blood gas tensions, and lactate and pyruvate concentrations. In four sheep with severe loads, we measured O2 saturation (SO2), O2 content, and hemoglobin. We found that with severe loads Pdi increased to 74.7 +/- 6.0 cmH2O by 40 min of loading, remained stable for 20-30 more min, then slowly decreased. In every sheep, arterial PCO2 increased when Pdi decreased. With moderate loads Pdi increased to and maintained levels of 40-55 cmH2O. With both loads, venous PO2, SO2, and O2 content decreased initially and then increased, so that the arteriovenous difference in O2 content decreased as loading continued. Hemoglobin increased slowly in three of four sheep. There were no appreciable changes in arterial or venous lactate and pyruvate during loading or recovery. We conclude that the changes in venous PO2, SO2, and O2 content may be the result of changes in hemoglobin, blood flow to the diaphragm, or limitation of O2 diffusion. Our data do not support the hypothesis that in sheep subjected to inspiratory flow resistive loads O2 availability limits diaphragmatic performance.\r"

Breath-by-breath values of TI, TE, and Pes were identified by digital computer during 21 260-s epochs of repetitive occlusive apnea during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. The control theory of interacting nonlinear oscillators was used to categorize the interaction between TI and TE for each epoch as either 1) synchronization, the strongest possible interaction between biological oscillators; 2) relative entrainment, a moderate interaction between oscillators; or 3) relative coordination, a weak interaction. The latter two interactions were characterized by systemic oscillations in the moving cross-correlation between TI and TE. The relationship between TI and Pes was analyzed in a similar fashion. Significant oscillations were present in all three parameters (P less than 0.0001 for each). We observed significant negative correlations between TI and TE and between TI and Pes (P less than 0.001 for each) when all breaths for all epochs were pooled. In no epoch was there a significant positive correlation between TI and TE or Pes. All three interactions were observed between TI and TE: five epochs of synchronization, nine of relative entrainment, and seven of relative coordination. In contrast, 19 of 21 epochs exhibited synchronization between TI and Pes, with 2 epochs of relative entrainment. The relative frequency of TI vs. Pes synchronization was significantly greater than TI vs. TE synchronization (P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Radiolabeled solutes were lavaged into the distal air spaces of isolated Ringer-perfused lungs, and apparent permeability-surface area products were calculated from the rates of isotope appearance in the recirculating perfusate. These data were used to estimate theoretical equivalent pore radii in the alveolar epithelium, with the assumption of diffusive flow through water-filled cylindrical pores. The alveolar epithelium is best characterized by two pore populations, with small pores (radius 0.5 nm) occupying 98.7% of total pore area and larger pores (radius 3.4 nm) occupying 1.3% of total pore area. Net water flow out of the alveolar space was measured by including an impermeant solute (dextran) in the lavage fluid and measuring its concentration in the alveolar space as a function of time. Under control conditions, net water flow averaged 167 nl/s. When 24 microM terbutaline was added to the perfusate, net water flow increased significantly to 350 nl/s (P less than 0.001). Terbutaline had no effect on the fluxes of either glycerol (which traverses the small pore pathway) or sucrose (which traverses the large pore pathway). These findings indicate that the intact mammalian alveolar epithelium is complex and highly resistant to the flow of solutes and water.\r"

The extraction pattern suggested that an uptake model, which includes multiple parallel uptake processes, provided a better representation of the data than the simple Michaelis-Menten equation, which has commonly been used to fit the saturable uptake data in previous studies. In particular, the rabbit lung data could be fit with two such parallel pathways. Since the 5-HT uptake could virtually be completely blocked by imipramine, both pathways can be considered to be carrier-mediated processes. The high-affinity pathway was saturable within the range of concentrations studied, with a Km and Vmax of approximately 0.84 microM and 0.21 nmol.s-1.g wet lung wt-1. The Km for the low-affinity pathway was larger than concentrations for which accurate uptake measurements are practical in the perfused organ. Thus, for the low-affinity pathway, only Vmax/Km was identifiable. Vmax/Km values for the high- and low-affinity pathways were approximately 2.87 and 0.35 ml/s, respectively. The results suggest that it will be worthwhile to investigate the behavior of these uptake parameters in response to changes in lung physiology and endothelial function in future studies.\r"

In studies in vitro, neurotensin and the COOH-terminal fragment neurotensin-(8-13) contracted strips of bronchial smooth muscle in a concentration-dependent fashion (P less than 0.001). In contrast, the NH2-terminal fragment neurotensin-(1-11) and the COOH-terminal fragment neurotensin-(12-13), the main fragments of neurotensin hydrolysis by NEP, had no effect. Phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) did not change resting tension but shifted the concentration-response curves to neurotensin to lower concentrations (P less than 0.001), whereas inhibitors of kininase II, aminopeptidases, serine proteases, and carboxypeptidase N were without effect. Removing the epithelium increased the contractile response to neurotensin (P less than 0.001), and phosphoramidon further increased the response to neurotensin in these tissues (P less than 0.001). Similar results were obtained in studies in vivo using aerosolized neurotensin and phosphoramidon. These results suggest that endogenous NEP in the airways modulates the effects of neurotensin on airway smooth muscle contraction by inactivating the peptide.\r"

Depletion of 99% of circulating platelets by antibodies did not prevent either acute and severe pulmonary hypertension or increased plasma TxB2 levels induced by heparin-protamine administration. We produced sheep platelet aggregation in vitro with bovine thrombin and measured marked TxB2 release (36.3 +/- 16.3 ng/10(9) platelets). In contrast, neither heparin, protamine, nor heparin-protamine complexes over a 10,000-fold range of concentrations induced platelet aggregation and release of thromboxane in vitro. Therefore sheep platelets are not the source of thromboxane production associated with acute pulmonary hypertension during the heparin-protamine reaction, and other cells must produce the thromboxane.\r"

In seven sheep, inhaled Ascaris suum produced significant early (282%) and late (176%) increases in specific lung resistance (sRL). WEB-2086 (1 mg/kg iv) given 20 min before antigen challenge did not affect the early response, but the peak late increase in sRL was only 37% over base line (P less than 0.05 vs. control). To study the mechanism by which PAF contributes to antigen-induced responses, we evaluated the effects of pharmacological probes on PAF-induced bronchoconstriction. Inhaled PAF (dose range 75-700 micrograms) caused reproducible (r = 0.781, P less than 0.05) increases in sRL in eight sheep. The PAF-induced bronchoconstriction was blocked by WEB-2086 (1 mg/kg iv) and by the leukotriene antagonist FPL-55712 (30 mg by aerosol); however, neither the cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin (2 mg/kg iv) nor the histamine H1-antagonist chlorpheniramine (2 mg/kg iv) blocked the PAF response. WEB-2086, however, did not block bronchoconstriction induced by aerosol leukotriene D4, indicating that PAF acts indirectly through leukotrienes. Finally, we determined whether PAF could induce late airway responses. Inhaled PAF produced an immediate increase in sRL in all seven sheep tested, but late airway responses were observed in only three of the seven sheep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Distinct amplitude modulations were observed in the raw EMGs during shivering. The peaks in EMG activity occurred simultaneously in the majority of the monitored muscles in all subjects.

For all subjects respiration was at a higher frequency than amplitude modulation in the EMG. Comparison of EMG records with expiratory flow rate traces in shivering subjects indicated no one-to-one correlation between the occurrence of respiration and EMG amplitude modulations. Respiratory flow rate and average rectified EMG showed significant correlation in only 33% of the cases. In addition, skin temperature changes could not be correlated with the SAMS.\r"

In the present study we compare the respective roles of high tidal volume with high PIP in intact immature rabbits to determine whether the increase in capillary permeability is the result of overdistension of the lung or direct pressure effects. New Zealand White rabbits were assigned to one of three protocols, which produced different degrees of inspiratory volume limitation: intact closed-chest animals (CC), closed-chest animals with a full-body plaster cast (C), and isolated excised lungs (IL). The intact animals were ventilated at 15, 30, or 45 cmH2O PIP for 1 h, and the lungs of the CC and C groups were placed in an isolated lung perfusion system. Microvascular permeability was evaluated using the capillary filtration coefficient (Kfc). Base-line Kfc for isolated lungs before ventilation was 0.33 +/- 0.31 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100g-1 and was not different from the Kfc in the CC group ventilated with 15 cmH2O PIP. Kfc increased by 850% after ventilation with only 15 cmH2O PIP in the unrestricted IL group, and in the CC group Kfc increased by 31% after 30 cmH2O PIP and 430% after 45 cmH2O PIP. Inspiratory volume limitation by the plaster cast in the C group prevented any significant increase in Kfc at the PIP values used. These data indicate that volume distension of the lung rather than high PIP per se produces microvascular damage in the immature rabbit lung.\r"

The decrease in survival in 17- to 23-day-old mice was statistically significant for both strains, as was the difference in survival in 17- to 23-day-old mice between the two strains. Gasping was absent or of brief (less than 5s) duration in 15 Swiss Webster mice that failed to recover. Seizure-like activity was observed during hypoxic apnea and gasping but was not seen significantly more often in mice that died. Simultaneous recordings of limb movement (electromyogram) and breathing pattern indicated that movement did not interfere with the occurrence of gasping. We conclude that in adults and very young mice autoresuscitation is a powerful mechanism for recovery from hypoxia, but at an intermediate age, it is frequently unsuccessful.\r"

The acute exercise bout was performed on a treadmill and consisted of a 45-min run until near exhaustion. E+P received an intravenous propranolol injection (0.8 mg/kg) 10 min before the exercise session. Michaelis-Menten kinetics at 1.5 s indicated that the Vmax for glucose transport was increased after each perturbation compared with C but were not different from each other (E, 4,334 +/- 377; E+P, 4,824 +/- 357; and C, 1,366 +/- 124 pmol.mg protein-1.s-1).

The increase in Vmax for transport was similar between E and E+P, indicating that exercise does not stimulate glucose transport via the beta-adrenergic receptor.\r"

We investigated whether P induced by chlorphentermine (CPH) causes changes in lung volumes and mechanics in this species. Groups of rats were fed CPH (50 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 14 wk. After each treatment period, lung volumes and mechanics were studied in the anesthetized, paralyzed, supine rat. Partial pressure-volume (PV) curves were developed at 3 and 6 ml above functional residual capacity (FRC; PV3, PV6), followed by maximal [up to total lung capacity (TLC)] PV curves. FRC was determined by saline displacement. Lungs were then fixed for histopathological examination. A subgroup of animals was allowed a recovery period of 6 wk, after the 9 wk of CPH administration. Pair-fed rats served as controls (CTR) at each time point. Lung weight increased in CPH-treated (CPH-T) rats from 1.5 +/- 0.2 (SD) g at week 1 to 5.8 +/- 1.4 g at week 14, reflecting the development of P. TLC, FRC, transpulmonary pressure at FRC, the shape of maximal PV curves, and static expiratory lung compliance computed from maximal PV data points did not change in CPH-T rats. However, partial PV curves of CPH-T lungs (particularly PV3) were shifted downward and to the right of those of CTR at 2, 3, 5, and 9 wk, indicating increased recoil pressure in phospholipidotic lungs at these time points.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Physiol. 54: 1188-1194, 1983). To provide a more complete description of performance near the limits of human tolerance to chronic hypoxia, we measured VO2max in volunteers in an altitude chamber before, during, and after a 40-day decompression to a barometric pressure (PB) of 240 Torr (PIO2 = 43 Torr). In five of eight subjects studied at sea level and PB of 464, 347, 289, and 240 Torr, VO2max was reduced from 4.13 to 1.17 l/min (49.1-15.3 ml.kg-1.min-1) in agreement with the prior study. Although the range decreased, the rank order among the subjects was preserved. Arterial O2 saturation at maximum effort decreased (46% by ear oximetry), but minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, and tidal volume did not. The highest minute ventilation (201 l/min BTPS) was observed at PB of 464 Torr. Arterial PCO2 in three subjects at PB of 240 Torr, at rest, and with maximum effort, averaged 10.3 and 9.6 Torr, respectively. Sustained hyperventilation was crucial to exercise performance during chronic, severe hypoxemia. VO2max was lower after altitude exposure compared with initial sea level values, indicating that exposure had not improved sea level exercise capacity.\r"

Everest. Samples of the vastus lateralis muscle extracted before decompression (SL-1), at 380 and 282 Torr, and on return to sea level (SL-2) indicated that maximal activities of enzymes representative of the citric acid cycle, beta-oxidation, glycogenolysis, glycolysis, glucose phosphorylation, and high-energy phosphate transfer were unchanged (P greater than 0.05) at 380 and 282 Torr over initial SL-1 values. After exposure to 282 Torr, however, representing an additional period of approximately 7 days, reductions (P less than 0.05) were noted in succinic dehydrogenase (21%), citrate synthetase (37%), and hexokinase (53%) between SL-2 and 380 Torr. No changes were found in the other enzymes. Capillarization as measured by the number of capillaries per cross-sectional area (CC/FA) was increased (P less than 0.05) in both type I (0.94 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.05) and type II (0.84 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.08) fibers between SL-1 and SL-2. This increase was mediated by a reduction in fiber area. No changes were found in fiber-type distribution (type I vs. type II). These findings do not support the hypothesis, at least in humans, that, at the level of the muscle cell, extreme hypobaric hypoxia elicits adaptations directed toward maximizing oxidative function.\r"

We made intraneural (microneurographic) determinations of MSNA in the right leg (peroneal nerve) while simultaneously measuring calf blood flow to the left leg, arterial pressure, and heart rate in 10 subjects before (control), during, and after (recovery) isometric handgrip exercise performed for 2.5 min at 15, 25, and 35% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Heart rate and arterial pressure increased above control within the initial 30 s of handgrip at all levels, and the magnitudes of the increases at end contraction were proportional to the intensity of the exercise. In general, neither MSNA nor CVR increased significantly above control levels during handgrip at 15% MVC. Similarly, neither variable increased above control during the initial 30 s of handgrip at 25 and 35% MVC; however, during the remainder of the contraction period, progressive, parallel increases were observed in MSNA and CVR (P less than 0.05). The correlation coefficients relating changes in MSNA to changes in CVR for the individual subjects averaged 0.63 +/- 0.07 (SE) (range 0.30-0.91) and 0.94 +/- 0.06 (range 0.80-0.99) for the 25 and 35% MVC levels, respectively. During recovery, both MSNA and CVR returned rapidly toward control levels. These findings demonstrate that muscle sympathetic nerve discharge and vascular resistance in the lower leg are tightly coupled during and after isometric arm exercise in humans. Furthermore, the exercise-induced adjustments in the two variables are both contraction intensity and time dependent.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that pulmonary gas exchange limitations may restrict VO2max in highly trained athletes who exhibit exercise-induced hypoxemia. Twenty healthy male volunteers were divided into two groups according to their physical fitness status and the demonstration of exercise-induced reductions in %SaO2 less than or equal to 92%: 1) trained (T), mean VO2max = 56.5 ml.kg-1.min-1 (n = 13) and 2) highly trained (HT) with maximal exercise %SaO2 less than or equal to 92%, mean VO2max = 70.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 (n = 7). Subjects performed two incremental cycle ergometer exercise tests to determine VO2max at sea level under normoxic (21% O2) and mild hyperoxic conditions (26% O2). Mean %SaO2 during maximal exercise was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) during hyperoxia compared with normoxia in both the T group (94.1 vs. 96.1%) and the HT group (90.6 vs. 95.9%). Mean VO2max was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) during hyperoxia compared with normoxia in the HT group (74.7 vs. 70.1 ml.kg-1.min-1). In contrast, in the T group, no mean difference (P less than 0.05) existed between treatments in VO2max (56.5 vs. 57.1 ml.kg-1.min-1). These data suggest that pulmonary gas exchange may contribute significantly to the limitation of VO2max in highly trained athletes who exhibit exercise-induced reductions in %SaO2 at sea level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In eight animals the end-inflation occlusion method disclosed statistically significant postoperative increases in respiratory system elastance (from 4.84 to 6.49 cmH2O.ml-1) and resistance (from 0.224 to 0.300 cmH2O.ml-1.s); the latter resulted from a rise of its uneven component (from 0.161 to 0.209 cmH2O.ml-1.s). In the remaining rats, rib cage morphometry at functional residual capacity after surgery showed significant decreases in lower rib cage circumference and anteroposterior and lateral diameters, whereas there was an increase in upper rib cage circumference and a fall in its lateral diameter. When these parameters were measured at end-inspiratory lung volume, the difference between intact and open abdomen were less striking; only lower rib cage circumference and upper rib cage lateral diameter significantly decreased postoperatively. Because surgery induced an expiratory volume of only 0.1 ml, it can be concluded that abdominal opening redistributed regional volumes within the lung, leading to increased unevenness in the system.\r"

Three of the subjects also performed single-breath N2 washouts (SBNW) by inspiring 1-liter breaths and expiring to residual volume at PILV = functional residual capacity (FRC), FRC + 1.0, and FRC - 0.5, respectively. From the SBNW we measured the phase III slope over the expired volume ranges of 0.75-1.0, 1.0-1.6, and 1.6-2.2 liters (S0.75, S1.0, and S1.6, respectively). Between a PILV of 0.92 +/- 0.09 (SE) liter above FRC and a PILV of 1.17 +/- 0.43 liter below FRC, Snf decreased by 61% (P less than 0.001) and alveolar mixing efficiency increased from 80 to 85% (P = 0.05). In addition, Snf and alveolar mixing efficiency were negatively correlated (r = 0.74). In contrast, over a similar volume range, S1.0 and S1.6 were greater at lower PILV.

Each subject performed multiple-breath N2 washouts (MBNW) at tidal volumes of 1 liter over a range of preinspiratory lung volumes (PILV) from functional residual capacity (FRC) to just above residual volume. All subjects performed washouts at PILV below their measured closing capacity. In addition five of the subjects performed MBNW at PILV below closing capacity with end-inspiratory breath holds of 2 or 5 s. We measured the following two independent indexes of ventilation maldistribution: 1) the normalized phase III slope of the final breaths of the washout (Snf) and 2) the alveolar mixing efficiency of those breaths of the washout where 80-90% of the initial N2 had been cleared. Between a mean PILV of 0.28 liter above closing capacity and that 0.31 liter below closing capacity, mean Snf increased by 132% (P less than 0.005). Over the same volume range, mean alveolar mixing efficiency decreased by 3.3% (P less than 0.05). Breath holding at PILV below closing capacity resulted in marked and consistent decreases in Snf and increases in alveolar mixing efficiency. Whereas inhomogeneity of ventilation decreases with lung volume when all airways are patent (J. Appl. Physiol. 66: 2502-2510, 1989), airway closure increases ventilation inequality, and this is substantially reduced by short end-inspiratory breath holds. These findings suggest that the predominant determinant of ventilation distribution below closing capacity is the inhomogeneous closure of airways subtending regions in the lung periphery that are close together.\r"

We employed a nasal pneumotachograph that separately quantified airflow between the two nasal passages and permitted unilateral nasal mask occlusions. Changes in minute ventilation (VI) and total (RT) and inspiratory pulmonary resistance (RI) were measured in response to 30-s unilateral occlusions during quiet and active sleep in 11 subjects. Unilateral nasal obstruction caused VI to fall significantly in both sleep states, because of a fall in both tidal volume and respiratory rate, without alteration in transcutaneous blood gases. RT and RI increased by 27 and 24 cmH2O.1-1.s, respectively, during unilateral nasal occlusion; this increase was greater than would be expected solely from elimination of one nasal passage. In 7 of the 11 infants a single dominant side could be identified as contributing 56-67% to tidal volume. The effect of occlusion on VI, RT, or RI did not differ whether the dominant or nondominant side was occluded. We conclude that unilateral nasal mask occlusion increases RT and RI and decreases VI in preterm infants. The larger than expected increase in resistance suggests that unilateral nasal loading predisposes to narrowing of the extrathoracic airway, and this may explain the comparable ventilatory responses to occluding the dominant and nondominant nasal passage.\r"

Preparations of ASM were made from ferret trachea and placed in tissue microchambers for study. Some of these preparations were arranged so that force transducers and intracellular microelectrodes (with tip resistances of 30-80 M omega) could be used to measure isometric force and cell membrane potential (Em) simultaneously from ASM cells stimulated by LTC4. We found that ferret tracheal muscle was relatively sensitive to LTC4 and that this sensitivity was not significantly affected by atropine (1 microM), phentolamine (1 microM), propranolol (3 microM), and pyrilamine (1 microM). In a 1 nM solution of LTC4, Em was -54.0 +/- 1.2 mV from 18 impalements (n) from 6 animals (N) compared with a base-line value of -61.6 +/- 0.8 mV (n/N = 29/8, P less than 0.0005). This change did not lead to force generation, however. Higher concentrations of LTC4 led to progressive decreases in Em to which force generation was closely coupled. Concentrations greater than or equal to 70 nM led to phasic oscillations in Em of 0.6-0.8 Hz and 1.7 mV in amplitude, which were abolished by 10 microM verapamil, although the base-line Em was unaffected by this concentration. Although 300 nM LTE4 by itself caused only a small depolarization of ferret trachealis, it substantially antagonized the electromechanical responsiveness of this smooth muscle to LTC4. We conclude that ferret ASM is relatively sensitive to LTC4 and that there is an electrical basis for the slow, prolonged force generation caused by this mediator.\r"

  ".W": "The forces generated by the cat diaphragm (DIA) during different ventilatory and nonventilatory behaviors were determined by measuring transdiaphragmatic pressures (Pdi). The Pdi generated during eupnea was only approximately 12% of the maximum Pdi (Pdimax) generated by bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation. When the animals breathed a gas mixture of 10% O2 and 5% CO2, the Pdi increased to approximately 28% of Pdimax. During total airway occlusion, the Pdi generated by the diaphragm increased to approximately 49% of Pdimax. Only during the gag reflex and sneezing did Pdi reach maximal levels. A model for diaphragm motor unit recruitment during these different behaviors was presented based on the proportion of different motor unit types within the diaphragm, the relative tetanic tensions produced by each unit type, and the assumption of an orderly pattern of motor unit recruitment.\r"

The left lower lobe (LLL) of 10 anesthetized dogs was ventilated independently but synchronously with the rest of the lungs. Blood flow to the LLL as a proportion of total flow (QLLL/QT) was measured during the on-transient of the hypoxic response when LLL inspirate was changed from O2 to N2. There was a damped oscillatory response of QLLL/QT to hypoxia (34 of 40 trials). In contrast, the off-transient was always monotonic. There was no enhancement of the steady state or dynamic hypoxic response with repeated challenges. Local alveolar hypercapnia caused a damped oscillatory response in the presence of local hypoxia (15 of 20 trials), but there was no response in the presence of local hyperoxia. We conclude that 1) the dynamic pulmonary vascular response to O2 and CO2 are not additive because the response to CO2 is attenuated by hyperoxia and 2) the damped oscillatory response that occurs during hypoxia is the result of changes of local alveolar CO2 per se.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanical interaction of the inspiratory muscles in the generation of changes in airway pressure is unclear. Using upper thoracic spinal cord stimulation to activate the intercostal muscles (IC) and bilateral supramaximal phrenic nerve stimulation to activate the diaphragm (D), we measured the changes in airway pressure produced by separate and combined IC and D activation over a wide range of lung volumes. Changes in parasternal IC and D length were assessed by sonomicrometry. With increasing lung volume, activation of the IC and D resulted in progressive decrements in generated airway pressure. Combined IC and D contraction produced greater negative swings in airway pressure than the arithmetic sum of separate IC and D contraction alone, indicating a synergistic effect. Moreover, synergism increased progressively with increasing lung volume. During combined muscle contraction, both the IC and D shortened less than during contraction of either muscle group alone. The tendency for the parasternal muscle to lengthen for a given change in airway pressure during D contraction alone increased with increasing lung volume, suggesting that the tendency for the rib cage to recoil inward increased progressively with increasing lung volume. Likewise, the tendency of the D to lengthen for a given change in airway pressure during IC contraction alone also increased progressively with increasing lung volume, suggesting that the tendency for the abdomen-D compartment to recoil inward also increased with increasing lung volume. We conclude that the IC and D interact synergistically to produce changes in airway pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bipolar stainless steel wire electrodes were placed unilaterally into the costal and crural portions of the diaphragm and into the parasternal intercostal muscle in the second or third intercostal space. Both peak and rate of rise of electromyographic activity of each chest wall muscle increased in curvilinear fashion in response to progressive hypoxia. Both crural and parasternal intercostal responses, however, were greater than those of the costal diaphragm. The onset of crural activation preceded that of the costal portion of the diaphragm and parasternal intercostal muscle activation. Despite differences in the degree of activation among the various chest wall muscles, the rate of increase in activation for any given muscle was linearly related to the rate of increases for the other two. This suggests that respiratory drive during progressive hypoxia increases in fixed proportion to the different chest wall inspiratory muscles. Our findings lend further support to the concept that the costal and crural diaphragm are governed by separate neural control mechanisms and, therefore, may be considered separate muscles.\r"

Healthy untrained subjects were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 12) or to an endurance (n = 16) or resistance training group (n = 19). Training consisted of three sessions per week for 26 wk. Resistance training consisted of one set of 8-12 repetitions on 10 Nautilus machines. Endurance training consisted of 40 min at 50-70% VO2max and at 75-85% VO2max for the first and last 13 wk of training, respectively. The endurance training group increased its VO2max by 16% during the first 13 wk of training and by a total of 22% after 26 wk of training; this group also increased its maximal O2 pulse, systolic blood pressure, and ventilation, and decreased its heart rate and perceived exertion during submaximal exercise. The resistance training group did not elicit significant changes in VO2max or in other maximal or submaximal cardiovascular responses despite eliciting 9 and 18% increases in lower and upper body strength, respectively. Thus healthy men and women in their 70s can respond to prolonged endurance exercise training with adaptations similar to those of younger individuals. Resistance training in older individuals has no effect on cardiovascular responses to submaximal or maximal treadmill exercise.\r"

In group 1 (n = 12), no infusions were given; in group 2, nine pairs of rabbits received either intravenous hyaluronidase (750 U.kg-1.min-1) or an equivalent volume of saline; in group 3, nine pairs of rabbits received either hyaluronidase or saline, followed by intravenous saline infusion amounting to 24% of body weight. At the end of each experiment, one lung was analyzed for extravascular lung water by the wet-dry method. Except for group 3, in all animals the other lung was analyzed for hyaluronan content by a method that involved hydrolyzing lung hyaluronan with fungal hyaluronidase to release reducing N-acetyl glucosamine groups, which were quantified. In group 1, lung hyaluronan, which varied from 50 to 159 micrograms/g dry wt (mean 106 +/- 35 micrograms/g dry wt), significantly correlated with variation in extravascular lung water (mean 4.2 +/- 0.3 g/g dry wt). In group 2 rabbits given hyaluronidase, lung hyaluronan was 40% lower and extravascular lung water was 14.6% lower than in paired controls (P less than 0.01). In group 3, volume expansion did not affect lung water, except after hyaluronidase when lung water was 47% higher than paired controls. We conclude that in the lung the content of hyaluronan is one of the determinants of extravascular water content.\r"

In the isolated perfused lobe of dog lung, we measured interstitial pressures by micropuncture at alveolar junctions (Pjct) and in adventitia of 30- to 50-microns microvessels (Padv) with stopped blood flow at vascular pressure of 3-5 cmH2O. We induced edema by raising vascular pressures. In nonedematous lobes (n = 6, EVLW = 3.1 +/- 0.3 g/g dry wt) at alveolar pressure of 7 cmH2O, Pjct averaged 0.5 +/- 0.8 (SD) cmH2O and the Pjct-Padv gradient averaged 0.9 +/- 0.5 cmH2O. After increase of alveolar pressure to 23 cmH2O the gradient was abolished in nonedematous lobes, did not change in moderately edematous lobes (n = 9, EVLW = 4.9 +/- 0.6 g/g dry wt), and increased in severely edematous lobes (n = 6, EVLW = 7.6 +/- 1.4 g/g dry wt). Perialveolar interstitial compliance decreased with increase of alveolar pressure. We conclude that increase of lung volume may reduce perialveolar interstitial liquid clearance by abolishing the Pjct-Padv gradient in nonedematous lungs and by compressing interstitial liquid channels in edematous lungs.\r"

The changes, which affected both the amplitude and the area of the M wave, were more obvious in the thenar than in the EDB muscles. In the thenar muscles the mean amplitude was already significantly enlarged after the first voluntary contraction and close to the maximal value by the third (mean maximal increase 23.6 +/- 12.6% of control). The increase in mean M wave area was more gradual, reaching a maximum of 29.3 +/- 14.1% at 100 s. After the voluntary thenar contractions ceased, the amplitude of the M wave subsided more rapidly than the area and had regained the control value within 50 s. The magnitude and time course of the increase in EDB M wave area (maximum change 25.9 +/- 15.2%) were similar to those of the thenar muscles; however, the subsequent decline was slower. The amplitude of the EDB M wave showed the least change, and the maximum increase (11.4 +/- 9.6%) occurred early in the postcontraction period. In both muscles the changes in M wave amplitude and area were significantly different from the control values.\r"

A control group received saline intratracheally. Saline volume-pressure curve was shifted more significantly to the left of the control group in starved than in fed rats and was superimposed in refed and fed groups. Mean linear intercept was larger and alveolar surface area was smaller in starved than in fed rats compared with the control group; both were similar in fed and refed rats. Protein and hydroxyproline content of the lung were higher in fed than in control and in starved groups; after refeeding these returned to the control values. We conclude that starvation aggravates elastase-induced injury and that refeeding results in the complete recovery of the mechanical but only partial recovery of the morphometric changes induced by starvation.\r"

The single-pass indicator-dilution method was used to measure the fraction (M) of [3H]BPAP hydrolyzed. Lung M was greater with albumin-free perfusate than when BSA was present. M decreased as the time (ti) that the BPAP was in contact with the BSA before reaching the lung was increased, suggesting that some BSA binding sites for BPAP were not in equilibrium during bolus transit through the lungs. The M vs. ti data were correlated using a model incorporating both rapid and slow binding kinetics of BPAP and BSA. For the slow BPAP-BSA interaction, the dissociation rate constant was approximately 0.015 s-1, and the fraction of the BPAP bound to these slowly equilibrating sites at equilibrium was approximately 22%. The results indicate that transient plasma protein binding kinetics can affect lung BPAP hydrolysis.\r"

This study further defines the nature of the increase in airway responsiveness induced by PAF. We employed an in situ canine tracheal preparation, which allows differentiation of the effects PAF has on airway smooth muscle contraction from confounding effects it has on inducing airway edema and secretions. We found that PAF, infused regionally into tracheal arteries, increases the responsiveness of the trachealis muscle to parasympathetic stimuli in a dose-dependent manner. This effect occurred within 15 min. To determine whether the increase in trachealis muscle responsiveness resulted from effects localized to the trachea, we compared the effect of PAF on the tracheal segment with effects of the lower airways of the lung. Delivered to the arteries perfusing the tracheal segment, PAF did not increase lung resistance during vagus nerve stimulation. These data indicate that airway hyperresponsiveness elicited by PAF results from regional stimulation and/or release of mediators that augment tracheal contractility and that this effect is distinct from systemic effects elicited by PAF.\r"

Rats were randomly assigned to a sedentary or training group. Training consisted of treadmill running at 18 m/min up an 8% grade, 1.5 h/day, 5 days/wk, for 6-8 wk. The rate of muscle glucose transport was assessed in the absence of insulin and in the presence of a physiological (0.15 mU/ml), a submaximal (1.50 mU/ml), and a maximal (15.0 mU/ml) insulin concentration by determining the rate of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3-OMG) accumulation during hindlimb perfusion. The average 3-OMG transport rate of the red gastrocnemii (fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibers) was significantly higher in the trained compared with the sedentary obese rats in the absence of insulin and in the presence of the three insulin concentrations. Significant improvements in 3-OMG transport were also observed in the plantarii (mixed fibers) of trained obese rats in the presence of 0, 0.15, and 15.0 mU/ml insulin. Training appeared to have little effect on the insulin-stimulated 3-OMG transport of the soleus (slow-twitch oxidative fibers) or white gastrocnemius (fast-twitch glycolytic fibers). The results suggest that the improvement in the muscle insulin resistance of the obese Zucker rat after moderate endurance training was associated with an improvement in the glucose transport process but that it was fiber-type specific.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was performed to determine whether neurogenic inflammation in the rat trachea can be exaggerated by inhibiting neutral endopeptidase, an enzyme that degrades tachykinins that are believed to mediate neurogenic inflammation. Neurogenic inflammation was produced by antidromic electrical stimulation of one vagus nerve (2.5 Hz, 1 ms, 5 V for 5 min) in the presence of atropine or by an intravenous injection of capsaicin (100 micrograms/kg). Neutrophils that adhered to the endothelium of venules were visualized and counted in tracheal whole mounts that were stained by a histochemical reaction for myeloperoxidase. Neural inflammation increased the number of adherent neutrophils. Pretreatment with the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon (1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg iv) increased neutrophil adhesion induced by neural inflammation. As assessed by the amount of extravasation of Monastral blue pigment, neural inflammation also increased vascular permeability, and this change was potentiated by phosphoramidon. These results are consistent with the concept that neuropeptides released from sensory nerves in the tracheal mucosa cause neutrophils to adhere to venules and increase vascular permeability and that these effects are modulated by neutral endopeptidase.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptides such as substance P are implicated in inflammation mediated by sensory nerves (neurogenic inflammation), but the roles in disease of these peptides and the peptidases that degrade them are not understood. It is well established that inflammation is a prominent feature of several airway diseases, including viral infections, asthma, bronchitis, and cystic fibrosis. These diseases are characterized by cough, airway edema, and abnormal secretory and bronchoconstrictor responses, all of which can be elicited by substance P. The effects of substance P and other peptides that may be involved in inflammation are decreased by endogenous neutral endopeptidase (NEP; also called enkephalinase, EC 3.4.24.11), which is a peptidase that degrades substance P and other peptides. In the present study, we report that rats with histories of infections caused by common respiratory tract pathogens (parainfluenza virus type 1, rat corona-virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis) not only have greater susceptibility to neurogenic inflammatory responses than do pathogen-free rats but also have a lower activity of NEP in the trachea. This reduction in NEP activity may cause the increased susceptibility to neurogenic inflammation by allowing higher concentrations of substance P to reach tachykinin receptors in the trachea. Thus decreased NEP activity may exacerbate some of the pathological responses in animals with respiratory tract infections.\r"

To determine the pattern, rate, and magnitude of cuff formation, we inflated sheep lungs to capacity with liquid (inflation pressure 19 cmH2O) for 3-300 min. After freezing the lobes in liquid N2, we measured perivascular cuff size and total perivascular volume in frozen blocks of each lobe and compared the results with previous measurements in dog lungs. Total cuff volume in sheep lungs reached a maximum value of 5% of air space volume, compared with 9% in dog lungs. In sheep lungs 94% of vessels greater than or equal to 0.5 mm diam and 16% of smaller vessels were surrounded by cuffs. In dog lungs these values were 99 and 47%, respectively. The ratio of cuff area to vessel area reached a maximum of 2.3 in sheep lungs and 3.4 in dog lungs. In an electrical analogue model designed to simulate cuff growth, estimated interstitial resistance to liquid flow was 6-15 times higher than similar estimates in dog lungs. These species differences might be the result of differences in the composition of the interstitial gel or to differences in the mechanical linkage between the lung parenchyma and vessel wall.\r"

Sustained elevation of the lung outflow pressure less than 5.5 cmH2O (4.01 mmHg) caused a negligible increase in Ppa and wet-to-dry lung weight ratio. Elevation of outflow pressures greater than 7.5 cmH2O (5.4 mmHg) increased the vascular albumin escape index more than the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio. Dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (db-cAMP) inhibited the increase in albumin escape index because of increased lung outflow pressure, suggesting perhaps a pressure-independent microvascular membrane effect of db-cAMP. Both LTC4 (2-micrograms bolus) and PAF (2-2,000 ng/ml perfusate) increased the albumin escape index in association with increases in Ppa and Pmv. Because the increased albumin escape index after LTC4 or PAF injection was largely accounted for by the increased vascular pressures and because db-cAMP and papaverine inhibited the rise in vascular pressures and in the albumin escape index, we conclude that vasoconstriction is an important contributor to LTC4- and PAF-induced edema formation in rat lungs.\r"

  ".W": "If the lung is an elastic continuum, both longitudinal and transverse stress waves should be propagated in the medium with distinct velocities. In five isolated sheep lungs, we investigated the propagation of stress waves. The lungs were degassed and then inflated to a constant transpulmonary pressure (Ptp). We measured signals transmitted at locations approximately 1.5, 6, and 11 cm from an impulse surface distortion with the use of small microphones embedded in the pleural surface. Two transit times were computed from the first two significant peaks of the cross-correlation of microphone signal pairs. The \"fast\" wave velocities averaged 301 +/- 92, 445 +/- 80, and 577 +/- 211 (SD) cm/s for Ptp values of 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O, respectively. Corresponding \"slow\" wave velocities averaged 139 +/- 22, 217 +/- 36, and 255 +/- 89 cm/s. The fast waves were consistent with longitudinal waves of velocity [(K + 4G/3)/p]1/2, where bulk modulus K = 4 Ptp and shear modulus G = 0.7 Ptp. The slow waves were consistent with transverse (and/or Rayleigh) waves of velocity (G/p)1/2, with a G value of 0.9 Ptp. Measured values of K were 5 Ptp and values of G measured by indentation tests were 0.7 Ptp. Thus, stress wave velocities measured on pleural surface of isolated lungs correlated well with elastic moduli of lung parenchyma.\r"

To clarify mechanisms involved in this collapse and, specifically, the relative contribution of left ventricular and right ventricular dysfunction, we studied 12 open-chest pigs. PAF infusion (0.04-0.28 nmol.kg-1.min-1) induced a 5- to 120-fold increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, a 75-98% fall in cardiac output, and systemic arterial hypotension. Right ventricular failure was indicated by chamber enlargement, decreased shortening, and increased right atrial pressures. In contrast, left ventricular dysfunction was accompanied by decreases in chamber dimensions and filling pressures that were unresponsive to volume expansion. U 46619 (a stable TxA2 analogue) and mechanical pulmonary artery constriction induced changes similar to PAF. In 11 additional closed-chest pigs, TxA2 blockade with indomethacin attenuated the PAF-induced rise in pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular dysfunction, and systemic hypotension. A specific TxA2 synthase inhibitor, OKY-046, also diminished hemodynamic effects of PAF in six other pigs. Tachyphylaxis was not observed in five pigs repeatedly given PAF. We conclude that acute right ventricular failure as the result of severe increase in pulmonary vascular resistance is the primary mechanism early in the course of PAF-induced shock in the pig. PAF-induced release of TxA2 may contribute significantly to these events.\r"

Nonallergic airway responsiveness, measured as the concentration of acetylcholine required to increase airway resistance by 5 cmH2O.l-1.s (PC5), increased in sensitized and decreased in nonsensitized dogs from 4 to 15 mo of age (P less than 0.01). Before antigen, at 12 and 15 mo, sensitized dogs were significantly (P less than 0.05) more responsive to acetylcholine than controls. Six hours after antigen, sensitized dogs were 11-fold more responsive (P less than 0.005) than controls at those times. More eosinophils and mast cells and fewer macrophages (P less than 0.05) were present in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 12- and 15-mo-old sensitized dogs than their controls.

Tissue resistance (Rti), airway resistance (Raw), and dynamic lung compliance (CL, dyn) were determined at constant tidal volume and at ventilatory frequencies ranging from 5 to 45 min-1 by an alveolar capsule technique. Halothane decreased RL at each breathing frequency by causing significant decreases in both Raw and Rti but did not change the relative contribution of Rti to RL at any frequency. Halothane increased CL,dyn at each breathing frequency, although there was little change in the static pressure-volume relationship. The administration of isoproterenol both airway and tissue components of RL; it may act by relaxing the contractile elements in the lung. Both components must be considered when the effects of volatile anesthetics on RL are interpreted.\r"

  ".W": "When bronchial segments were perfused with Krebs solution at a constant pressure (5-6 cmH2O), the resistance rose exponentially with increasing concentrations of either carbachol or histamine in the lumen. The pressure-flow relationship was linear. Histamine and carbachol caused 43 and 47% muscle shortening, respectively, and produced the same maximum effect (Emax) because they both stopped perfusion. In bronchial strips the maximum isometric force or isotonic shortening to carbachol was more than twice that of histamine and the responses showed a plateau. There were no significant differences in sensitivities [negative log of the concentration producing half-maximal response (EC50)] to either carbachol or histamine in the strips (isotonic and isometric) and the segments perfused at constant pressure. When airway segments were perfused at a constant flow, however, responses plateaued and the sensitivities to carbachol and histamine were reduced more than tenfold compared with the strips [4.71 +/- 0.20 and 6.22 +/- 0.08 (SE) for carbachol in segments and isometric strips, respectively, and 3.92 +/- 0.13 and 4.94 +/- 0.11 (SE) for histamine].

Seven endurance-trained male college students performed three incremental bicycle ergometer exercise tests. The first two tests (tests I and II) were identical and consisted of 3-min stage durations with 2-min rest intervals and increased by 50-W increments until exhaustion. During these tests, blood was sampled from a hyperemized earlobe for lactate and pH measurement (and from an antecubital vein during test I), and the exercise intensities corresponding to the lactate threshold (LT), individual anaerobic threshold (IAT), and onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) were determined. The test III was performed at predetermined work loads (50 W below OBLA, at OBLA, and 50 W above OBLA), with the same stage and rest interval durations of tests I and II. Muscle biopsies for lactate and pH determination were taken at rest and immediately after the completion of the three exercise intensities. Blood samples were drawn simultaneously with each biopsy. Muscle lactate concentrations increased abruptly at exercise intensities greater than the \"below-OBLA\" stage [50.5% maximal O2 uptake (VO2 max)] and resembled a threshold. An increase in blood lactate and [H+] also occurred at the below-OBLA stage; however, no significant change in muscle [H+] was observed. Muscle lactate concentrations were highly correlated to blood lactate (r = 0.91), and muscle-to-blood lactate ratios at below-OBLA, at-OBLA, and above-OBLA stages were 0.74, 0.63, 0.96, and 0.95, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Slow- (ST) and fast-twitch (FT) fibers were assayed for total creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, total lactate dehydrogenase (LD), the LD isozyme that predominates in the heart muscle of most vertebrates (LD1), and citrate synthase (CS). Regardless of training of the athletes, both CK-MB and CS were higher in ST than in FT fibers. Also, irrespective of fiber type, CK-MB and CS were greatest in the endurance-trained group. A positive correlation existed between CK-MB and CS, relating oxidative capacity of individual fibers with CK-MB. Total CK varied little among the fiber types, trained groups, or controls. Total LD in FT fibers was greater than in ST fibers in all groups, with only ST fibers from the endurance-trained group containing substantial amounts of LD1. These findings suggest that specific training, endurance exercise, causes a favorable metabolic adaptation of CK and LD isozymes at the individual fiber level, allowing for the muscle to cope with increased energy demands during prolonged exercise.\r"

After training, twitch contraction time decreased by approximately 20%. One-half relaxation time, peak twitch torque, and percent fiber type in any of the muscles of the triceps surae complex were not changed by training. Type I and type II fiber areas increased in the soleus by approximately 30%, but only type II fibers showed an increased in area in the lateral gastrocnemius (40%). Despite such changes in fiber area, the volume density of the sarcoplasmic reticulum-transverse tubular (SR) network averaged 3.2 +/- 0.6 and 5.9 +/- 0.9% in type I and type II fibers, respectively, before and after training in the two heads of the gastrocnemius. Type I SR fraction increased to 3.5 +/- 1.2% after training in the soleus; however, correlations were not significant between the change in the volume density of SR and the change in twitch contraction time (R = 0.46, P = 0.45) or the change in one-half relaxation time (R = -0.68, P = 0.08). The results demonstrate that isometric training at 100% maximal voluntary contraction induced changes in twitch contraction time that were not directly related to changes in the volume density of SR in fibers of the triceps surae.\r"

Ventilatory acclimatization is essentially complete after approximately 1 wk at 4,300 m, such that improvement in submaximal exercise SaO2 would then require other mechanisms. On days 2, 8, and 22 on Pikes Peak (4,300 m), 6 male subjects performed prolonged steady-state cycle exercise at 79% maximal O2 uptake (VO2 max). Resting SaO2 rose from day 1 (78.4 +/- 1.6%) to day 8 (87.5 +/- 1.4%) and then did not increase further by day 20 (86.4 +/- 0.6%). During exercise, SaO2 values (mean of 5-, 15-, and 30-min measurements) were 72.7% (day 2), 78.6% (day 8), and 82.3% (day 22), meaning that all of the increase in resting SaO2 occurred from day 1 to day 8, but exercise SaO2 increased from day 2 to day 8 (5.9%) and then increased further from day 8 to day 22 (3.7%). On day 22, the exercise SaO2 was higher than on day 8 despite an unchanged ventilation and O2 consumption. The increased exercise SaO2 was accompanied by decreased CO2 production. The mechanisms responsible for the increased exercise SaO2 require further investigation.\r"

After 2 wk of HS, small bundles of fibers were isolated from the soleus and the deep and superficial regions of the lateral and medial heads of the gastrocnemius, respectively. The bundles were placed in skinning solution and stored at -20 degrees C until studied. Single fibers were isolated and suspended between a motor arm and force transducer, the functional properties were studied, and subsequently the fiber type was established by myosin heavy chain (MHC) analysis on 1-D sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After HS, slow-twitch fibers of the soleus showed a significant reduction in fiber diameter (68 +/- 2 vs. 41 +/- 1 micron) and peak tension (1.37 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.06 kg/cm2), whereas the maximal shortening speed (Vmax) increased [1.49 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.92 +/- 0.14 fiber lengths (FL)/s]. A histogram showed two populations of fibers: one with Vmax values identical to control slow-twitch fibers and a second with significantly elevated Vmax values. This latter group frequently contained both slow and fast MHC protein isoforms. The pCa-force relation of the soleus slow-twitch fibers was shifted to the right; consequently, the free Ca2+ required for the onset of tension and for 50% of peak tension was significantly higher after HS. Slow-twitch fibers isolated from the gastrocnemius after HS showed a significant reduction in diameter (67 +/- 4 vs. 44 +/- 3 microns) and peak tension (1.2 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.96 +/- 0.07 kg/cm2), but Vmax was unaltered (1.70 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.65 +/- 0.18 FL/s). Fast-twitch fibers from the red gastrocnemius showed a significant reduction in diameter (59 +/- 2 vs. 49 +/- 3 microns) but no change in peak tension or Vmax. Fast-twitch fibers from the white superficial region of the medial head of the gastrocnemius were unaffected by HS. Collectively, these data suggest that the effects of HS on fiber function depend on the fiber type and location. Both slow-twitch type I and fast-twitch type IIa fibers atrophied; however, only slow-twitch fibers showed a decline in peak tension, and the increase in Vmax was restricted to a subpopulation of slow-twitch soleus fibers.\r"

Effects of consecutive-day exposure to lower O3 concentrations (0.20-0.25 ppm) have yielded equivocal results. To examine the occurrence of hyperresponsiveness at two levels of O3 exposure, 15 aerobically trained males completed seven 1-h exposures of continuous exercise at work rates eliciting a mean minute ventilation of 60 1/min. Three sets of consecutive-day exposures, involving day 1/day 2 exposures to 0.20/0.20 ppm O3, 0.35/0.20 ppm O3, and 0.35/0.35 ppm O3, were randomly delivered via an obligatory mouthpiece inhalation system. A filtered-air exposure was randomly placed 24 h before one of the three sets. Treatment effects were assessed by standard pulmonary function tests, exercise ventilatory pattern (i.e., respiratory frequency, f; and tidal volume, VT) changes and subjective symptom (SS) response. Initial O3 exposures to 0.35 and 0.20 ppm had a statistically significant effect, compared with filtered air, on all measurements. On reexposure to 0.35 ppm O3 24 h after an initial 0.35 ppm O3 exposure, significant hyperresponsiveness was demonstrated for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), f, VT, and total SS score. Exposure to 0.20 ppm O3 24 h after 0.35 ppm O3 exposure, however, resulted in significantly enhanced responses (compared with initial 0.20 ppm O3 exposure) only for FEV1, f, and VT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate the mechanisms that generate albumin gradients across airway epithelia, we have investigated whether active albumin absorption is a feature of bronchial epithelia. Freshly excised canine bronchi were mounted in Ussing chambers and short-circuited. Permeability coefficients of 14C-labeled canine albumin (Palb) were measured in the mucosal-to-submucosal (M----S) and submucosal-to-mucosal (S----M) directions in conductance-matched tissues. Mean steady-state values for Palb in the absorptive (M----S) direction (5.97 +/- 1.89 x 10(-7) cm/s) were significantly greater than rates in the S----M direction (1.09 +/- 0.41 x 10(-7) cm/s). Simultaneous measurements detected no asymmetry of transport of the fluid phase marker [3H]inulin. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrated that the majority of the radiolabel released into the submucosal bathing solution represented albumin fragments. Albumin fragments per se were not transported because no asymmetries in permeabilities of albumin fragments isolated from spontaneous degradation of tracer were detected. Decreasing the temperature of the bathing solution from 37 to 4 degrees C completely inhibited net albumin absorption. [14C]albumin transport was saturated by addition of high concentrations of unlabeled albumin (estimated Michaelis constant = 1.6 x 10(-3) M). These results demonstrate that albumin is absorbed by a low-affinity process that may contribute to the maintenance of low albumin concentrations in secretions.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the longitudinal distribution of intra-airway heat and water exchanges and their effects on airway wall temperature by directly measuring respiratory fluctuations in airstream temperature and humidity, as well as airway wall temperature, at multiple sites along the airways of endotracheally intubated dogs. By comparing these axial thermal and water profiles, we have demonstrated that increasing minute ventilation of cold or warm dry air leads to 1) further penetration of unconditioned air into the lung, 2) a shift of the principal site of total respiratory heat loss from the trachea to the bronchi, and 3) alteration of the relative contributions of conductive and evaporative heat losses to local total (conductive plus evaporative) heat loss. These changes were not accurately reflected in global measurements of respiratory heat and water exchange made at the free end of the endotracheal tube. Raising the temperature of inspired dry air from frigid to near body temperature principally altered the mechanism of airway cooling but did not influence airway mucosal temperature substantially. When local heat loss was increased from both trachea and bronchi (by increasing minute ventilation), only the tracheal mucosal temperature fell appreciably (up to 4.0 degrees C), even though the rise in heat loss from the bronchi about doubled that in the trachea. Thus it appears that the bronchi are better able to resist changes in airway wall temperature than is the trachea. These data indicate that the sites, magnitudes, and mechanisms of respiratory heat loss vary appreciably with breathing pattern and inspired gas temperature and that these changes cannot be predicted from measurements made at the mouth. In addition, they demonstrate that local heat (and presumably, water) sources that replenish mucosal heat and water lost to the airstream are important in determining the degree of local airway cooling (and presumably, drying).\r"

Nine males exercised to exhaustion at 84.0 +/- 3.14% (SE) of maximum O2 consumption on a cycle ergometer in a double-blind randomized protocol with either no infusion (control) or an infusion of 0.9% NaCl (mean vol 1,280.3 +/- 107.3 ml). Blood samples and expired gases (breath-by-breath), as well as core and skin temperatures, were analyzed. Plasma volume decreased less during exercise with the infusion at 15 min (-13.7 +/- 1.4% control vs. -5.3 +/- 1.7% infusion, P less than 0.05) and at exhaustion (-13.6 +/- 1.2% vs. -1.3 +/- 2.2%, P less than 0.01). The improved fluid homeostasis was associated with a lower core temperature during exercise (39.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C for control and 38.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C for infusion at exhaustion, P less than 0.01) and lower heart rate (194.1 +/- 3.9 beats/min for control and 186.0 +/- 5.1 beats/min for infusion at exhaustion, P less than 0.05). However, endurance time did not differ between control and infusion (21.96 +/- 3.56 and 20.82 +/- 2.63 min, respectively), and neither did [H+], peak O2 uptake, and CO2 production, end-tidal partial pressure of CO2, blood lactate, or blood pressure. In conclusion, saline infusion increases heat dissipation and lowers core temperature during strenuous exercise but does not influence endurance time.\r"

D-[5-3H]glucose (10 microCi/100 g body wt) was administered 10 min before the end of exercise. Hindlimb muscles [soleus (SOL), plantaris (PL), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and red (RG) and white gastrocnemius (WG)] and a portion of liver were analyzed for glycogen concentrations and rates of glycogen synthesis (i.e., D-[3H]glucose incorporated into glycogen). At rest, marked differences were observed among muscles in their rates of glucose incorporation into glycogen: i.e., SOL = 24.3 +/- 3.1, RG = 5.4 +/- 1.9, PL = 2.8 +/- 1.1, EDL = 0.54 +/- 0.10, WG = 0.12 +/- 0.02 (SE) dpm.micrograms glycogen-1.10 min-1 (P less than 0.05 between respective muscles). Compared with the glucose incorporation into glycogen at rest, increments in the PL (272%), RG (189%), WG (400%), EDL (274%), and liver (175%) were observed after 90 min of exercise (P less than 0.05, all data). In contrast, a decrease in glucose incorporation into glycogen (-62%) occurred in the SOL at min 15 (P less than 0.05), but this returned to the rates observed at rest after 90 min of exercise. This measure for rates of net glycogen synthesis (dpm.microgram glycogen-1.10 min-1) was weakly related to the ambient glycogen levels in most muscles; the exception was the SOL (r = -0.79; P less than 0.05). There was up to a 50-fold difference in glycogen synthesis among muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The apneas corresponded to cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth and were not distinguished as central, mixed, or obstructive. Changes in heart rate associated with the apneas were not identified. To determine whether ventilatory pattern characteristics might predict either the type of apnea or heart rate changes during the apnea, we analyzed measurements of chest wall movement and heart rate that were made during the earlier studies. Chest wall movement measured by magnetometers was compared with airflow measured with a face mask and pneumotachograph. Tidal volume, breath duration, and ventilation were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis, converted to time-axis data strings, and filtered with a comb of zero phase shift digital band-pass filters to detect breathing patterns. Of 182 apneas greater than or equal to 3 s duration, 55% were central, 31% were mixed, and 14% were obstructive. All three types of apnea were related to ventilatory oscillations. Multiple linear and logistic regressions showed that an apnea was more likely to be obstructive when it was long and when the underlying ventilatory oscillation was due primarily to an oscillation in breath duration. Multiple linear and logistic regressions showed that decreases in heart rate were related primarily to the duration of apnea and secondarily to the characteristics of the underlying breathing patterns.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic response during and after acute asphyxia was studied in 14 newborn piglets. An apnea-like asphyxial insult was produced in paralyzed mechanically ventilated piglets by discontinuing ventilation until the piglets became bradycardic (heart rate less than 80 beats/min). Seven piglets had organ blood flow measured by microspheres at control, during asphyxia (PO2 = 16 +/- 11 Torr, pH = 7.31 +/- 0.07, PCO2 = 47 +/- 9 Torr), and during recovery from asphyxia. During acute asphyxia, rapid organ blood flow redistribution occurred, producing decreased renal and skeletal muscle blood flow, while coronary blood flow increased. Although total brain blood flow changed little during asphyxia, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) analysis revealed significant nonhomogeneous blood flow distribution within the brain during asphyxia, with decreases to the cerebral gray and white matter and the choroid plexus, whereas brain stem structures had increased flow. During recovery with reventilation, total brain blood flow increased 24% above control, with a more uniform distribution and increased flow to all brain regions. The time course of rCBF changes during acute asphyxia was then determined in seven additional piglets with CBF measurements made sequentially at 30-60 s, 60-120 s, and 120-180 s of asphyxia. The vasoconstriction seen in cortical structures, concurrent with the reduction in skeletal and kidney blood flow, known to be sympathetically mediated, suggest a selective reflex effect in this brain region. The more gradual and progressive vasodilation in brain stem regions during asphyxia is consistent with chemical control. These findings demonstrate significant regional heterogeneity in CBF regulation in newborn piglets.\r"

Mechanical percussion was applied at 10-16 Hz and caused an esophageal pressure swing (delta Pes) of 10-17 cmH2O. Hand clapping was applied at 4-7 Hz and caused a delta Pes of 6-17 cmH2O. At necropsy there were large reddened areas on the lateral surface of the underlying lung as well as smaller reddened areas on the hilar surfaces of both lungs and on the lateral surface of the opposite lung. These reddened regions were demonstrated to be atelectatic by postmortem lung inflation (which caused the reddened areas to disappear) and by microscopic examination. Despite the atelectasis, gas exchange improved toward the end of the percussion or clapping period. In four dogs that were ventilated for an additional 20 min after percussion, there was a tendency for gas exchange initially to worsen and then to gradually improve.\r"

Inspired and expired breath length, nasal flows, nasal ventilation, transnasal pressures, nasal work of breathing, nasal powers, and nasal resistances were measured simultaneously on a breath-by-breath basis and averaged over the 30-s interval before oral augmentation.

Training had no effect on weight or body composition in either group. The elderly had more adipose tissue and less muscle mass than the young. Initial peak VO2 was lower in the elderly, but the absolute increase of 5.5-6.0 ml.kg-1.min-1 after training was similar for both groups. Muscle biopsies taken at rest showed that, before training, muscle glycogen stores were 61% higher in the young. Before training, glycogen utilization per joule during submaximal exercise was higher in the elderly. Glycogen stores and muscle O2 consumption increased significantly in response to training in the elderly only. After training, the proportion of energy derived from whole body carbohydrate oxidation during submaximal exercise declined in the young only. The absolute changes that training produced in peak VO2 were similar in both age groups, but the 128% increase in muscle oxidative capacity was greater in the elderly, suggesting that peripheral factors play an important role in the response of the elderly to endurance exercise.\r"

They consumed 0.6, 0.9, or 1.2 g.kg-1.day-1 of high-quality protein over three separate 10-day periods, while maintaining training and constant body weight.

The estimated protein requirement was 0.94 +/- 0.05 g.kg-1.day-1 for the 12 men, with no effect of age. Whole body protein turnover, using [15N]glycine as a tracer, and 3-methylhistidine excretion were not different in the two groups, despite lower physical activity of the middle-aged men. Protein intake affected whole body protein flux and synthesis but not 3-methylhistidine excretion. These data show that habitual endurance exercise was associated with dietary protein needs greater than the current Recommended Dietary Allowance of 0.8 g.kg-1.day-1. However, whole body protein turnover and 3-methylhistidine excretion were not different from values reported for sedentary men.\r"

Untrained animals ran on a treadmill for 1 h at submaximal intensity and were killed 0, 6, or 24 h after running. Nonexercised rats served as controls. In situ perfused soleus muscles were prepared for electron microscopy. Micrographed cross sections were quantitatively analyzed for parameters indicative of capillary blood flow or transcapillary exchange. Capillary lumina were ovally rather than circularly shaped, and no indications for obstruction of blood flow at the capillary level were found. Endothelial cells and their organelles had a normal appearance in all groups. However, immediately after exercise, capillaries showed a decreased thickness of their endothelium and basal membrane, probably caused by dehydration. Six hours after exercise, muscle fibers were swollen (28% increase in cross-sectional area), resulting in a slightly increased diffusion distance. This fiber swelling was not associated with an increase in muscle water content, a finding for which no explanation could be found. Twenty-four hours after the animals ran, capillaries located near degenerated muscle fibers had an increased cross-sectional luminal area and an increased luminal circumference. This effect decreased gradually with increasing distance from the degenerated fiber area. The present morphometric results do not support the hypothesis that changes in capillary morphology primarily contribute to exercise-induced focal muscle fiber degeneration.\r"

  ".U": "89308433\r", 
  ".W": "Luminal epithelial projections formed during bronchoconstriction define interstices in which liquid can collect. Liquid in these interstices could amplify the degree of luminal compromise due to muscular contraction in at least two distinct ways. First, the luminal cross-sectional area is reduced by simple filling of the interstices. Second, if the surface tension (gamma) of the air-liquid interface is positive, the pressure drop across the interface produces an additional inward force that can further constrict the airway. We present a theoretical treatment of these two mechanisms together with data which suggest that both may significantly amplify the luminal narrowing due to airway smooth muscle contraction, particularly in small airways when gamma is high. To qualitatively assess the effects of altered gamma, guinea pig lungs with normal and altered airway liquid lining layers were frozen and studied while fully hydrated by low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. Airway gamma was altered in these animals by intratracheal instillation of 0.5 mg lysoplatelet-activating factor (lyso-PAF). The interstices of normal airways were dry, whereas the interstices of airways with altered surface lining layers were liquid filled. In addition, the surfactant inhibitory properties of lyso-PAF, 2-arachidonyl-PAF, and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) were measured with a pulsating bubble surfactometer, using surfactant TA as the model surfactant. Minimal gamma (gamma min) of surfactant TA alone was 4.0 +/- 0.2 dyn/cm; a 5% mixture of lyso-PAF with surfactant TA resulted in a significantly (P less than 0.02) greater gamma min of 8.8 +/- 1.8 dyn/cm. In contrast, 2-arachidonyl-PAF and DPPC had minimal effects on gamma min of surfactant TA.\r"

The calcium channel blocking agent caused a small reduction in lobar vascular resistance and blocked pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to BAY K 8644, an agent which promotes calcium entry. The calcium entry blocking agent also reduced pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to methoxamine and to BHT 933, alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, and to U 46619, an agent which mimics the actions of thromboxane A2. Although there was a marked difference in vasoconstrictor potency in the pulmonary vascular bed, responses to the thromboxane mimic and to the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists were reduced by approximately the same extent. The increases in systemic arterial pressure in response to BAY K 8644, methoxamine, and BHT 933 were also reduced by nisoldipine, and the calcium entry antagonist reduced systemic arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. The results of the present study suggest that an extracellular source of calcium is required for the maintenance of vascular tone and for the expression of vasoconstrictor responses, resulting from activation of alpha 1- and postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors and thromboxane receptors in the feline pulmonary vascular bed.\r"

Thirty-week-old male littermates served as controls. Nephrectomy was done to produce major tissue loss and trauma and to assess blood somatomedin C. At the end of the experiment, the right lungs of the pneumonectomy animals had a greater lung volume, weight, gas-exchanging surface area, and alveolar number than the nephrectomy animals and the controls, and their air spaces were the same size. When compared with both lungs of the nephrectomy group and the controls, lung weight was the same; lung volume, alveolar number, and protein were not significantly less in the pneumonectomy group, but gas-exchanging area (compared with controls only), DNA, and RNA were. After left nephrectomy, the right kidney increased in weight; nephrectomy had no effect on lung size or structure. We conclude that pneumonectomy at age 10 wk in male rabbits results in significant compensatory lung growth, including alveolar multiplication, and this persists to age 30 wk. Compensatory lung growth, however, was incomplete; that is, it did not reconstitute (equal) in all respects that of both lungs of the nephrectomy animals or the controls.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of three different anesthetics (halothane, ketamine-xylazine, and diethyl ether) on arterial blood gases, acid-base status, and tissue glycogen concentrations in rats subjected to 20 min of rest or treadmill exercise (10% grade, 28 m/min). Results demonstrated that exercise produced significant increases in arterial lactate concentrations along with reductions in arterial Pco2 (PaCO2) and bicarbonate concentrations in all rats compared with resting values. Furthermore, exercise produced significant reductions in the glycogen concentrations in the liver and soleus and plantaris muscles, whereas the glycogen concentrations found in the diaphragm and white gastrocnemius muscles were similar to those found at rest. Rats that received halothane and ketamine-xylazine anesthesia demonstrated an increase in Paco2 and a respiratory acidosis compared with rats that received either anesthesia. These differences in arterial blood gases and acid-base status did not appear to have any effect on tissue glycogen concentrations, because the glycogen contents found in liver and different skeletal muscles were similar to one another cross all three anesthetic groups. These data suggest that even though halothane and ketamine-xylazine anesthesia will produce a significant amount of ventilatory depression in the rat, both anesthetics may be used in studies where changes in tissue glycogen concentrations are being measured and where adequate general anesthesia is required.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the extent and nature of the variability of measurements of upper airway area by acoustic reflection (AAAR), we made repeated measures of pharyngeal AAAR in 10 normal adult volunteers. We selected mean pharyngeal area as a better index of upper airway size than peak pharyngeal area or pharyngeal volume. Within-run variability of this measure was 8 +/- 4% (SD) (coeff of variation). This variability could not be explained by changes in lung volume or differences in phase of respiration. Five subjects had tracheal and pharyngeal area measured by using both the custom-made wax mouthpiece (W) and a commercial rubber pulmonary function mouthpiece (R). Reproducibility of pharyngeal AAAR was within 10% (coeff of variation) using R, but measurements of pharyngeal AAAR varied with the different types of mouthpiece, as W/R ranged from 0.72 to 1.70. In contrast, measurements of midtracheal area were similar for both mouthpiece types [mean W/R = 0.97 +/- 14 (SD)]. The acoustic reflection technique yields a reproducible index of pharyngeal size that does not vary with phase of respiration or modest changes in lung volume. Either W or R may be used to make clinical measurements, but the type of mouthpiece should be consistent and specified.\r"

  ".U": "89308755\r", 
  ".W": "In a retrospective review of the results of 3,612 arthroscopic procedures that were performed for the treatment of an acute or a chronic meniscal lesion, with or without an associated ligamentous lesion, we identified eighty meniscal tears (in seventy-five patients) that had been assumed to be stable. Seventy were vertical longitudinal tears and ten were vertical radial tears. The seventy longitudinal tears included fifty-two lateral and eighteen medial meniscal lesions. All of the radial tears were in the lateral meniscus. Of the seventy-five patients, fifty-two had been followed for two to ten years. At the time of follow-up, only six of these fifty-two patients had needed additional intervention because of symptoms that were related to the meniscal tear. Four of them had the intervention after a sports-related traumatic extension of a stable tear, and two, because persistent symptoms were caused by the original meniscal lesion. A repeat arthroscopy was performed on thirty-two patients (twenty-six of whom had a longitudinal tear and six of whom had a radial tear), at an average of twenty-six months after the original arthroscopy. Seventeen of the twenty-six longitudinal tears had completely healed. Five of the six radial tears had no evidence of healing and one had extended. Neither ligamentous laxity nor a meniscal tear that was chronic at the time when it was discovered appeared to preclude healing of the stable longitudinal tears. No localized degenerative changes in the adjacent articular cartilage were found in association with any of the stable vertical longitudinal or radial meniscal lesions. Excluding the six patients who had had additional surgical treatment, none of the fifty-two patients who filled out a questionnaire reported that they had symptoms of a meniscal lesion, and none of the forty-two patients who were re-examined two years or more after the operation had signs of a meniscal lesion. Stable vertical longitudinal tears, which tend to occur in the peripheral vascular portions of the menisci, have great potential for healing. The tear should be left alone unless it is the only abnormality that is found and it is causing symptoms that warrant treatment. Stable radial tears, which tend to occur in the avascular inner one-third of the meniscus, have little potential for healing. Whether it is best to leave these lesions alone or to fashion an intact rim by contouring the meniscus was not established by this study.\r"

The cases of seventy-four patients who had seventy-six consecutive total hip or knee arthroplasties were studied prospectively. Intraoperative salvage of blood was performed using the Cell Saver. After closure of the fascial layer or joint capsule, the drainage tubes were connected to the Cell Saver in the operating room and remained connected in the recovery room for a mean of 2.9 hours. Blood that was collected in the recovery room was then processed and transfused back to the patient. The average amount of blood that was salvaged after different types of arthroplasty varied. The addition of bone cement to the acetabular side during primary total hip replacement decreased the amount of postoperative bleeding and of salvaged blood (p = 0.018), whereas cementing the femoral component had no statistically significant effect. Revision total hip replacement also resulted in more bleeding and in the collection of more blood in the recovery room than did primary total hip replacement (p = 0.03), especially if cement was not used (p less than 0.001). There were no statistical differences in the amount of blood that was collected in the recovery room after unilateral, bilateral, primary, or revision total knee replacement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For all of the reconstructions, the femoral and acetabular components were fixed to bone with cement that did not contain antibiotics. An average of 5.5 years (range, 2.0 to 13.6 years) after reimplantation, infection had recurred in eleven hips (13 per cent). The presence of retained cement at the time of the resection arthroplasty appeared to be associated with recurrent sepsis, as three of seven patients who had retained cement had a recurrent infection, compared with only eight (11 per cent) of seventy-five patients from whom the cement had been completely removed (p less than 0.01). The twenty-six patients (twenty-six hips) who had the reimplantation less than one year after the resection arthroplasty had seven recurrent infections (27 per cent), while the fifty-six patients who had reimplantation more than one year after the resection arthroplasty had only four recurrences (7 per cent) (p less than 0.001). Three of the seven patients in whom the infection was caused by gram-negative bacilli and group-D streptococcal organisms (which are considered highly virulent) and who received systemic antimicrobial therapy for less than twenty-eight days had a recurrence. In contrast, only one of the thirteen patients in whom the infection was caused by a virulent organism and who were treated for longer than twenty-eight days had a recurrence (p = 0.055). The two-stage reconstruction is an effective, safe technique even when the infection is caused by a virulent organism.\r"

The external fixation had been maintained for an average of fifty-two days (range, seven to 230 days). The mean interval between removal of the external fixator and intramedullary nailing was sixty-five days (range, three to 360 days). In five of the seven patients who had had an infection at one or more of the pin sites, an infection later developed around the intramedullary nail. In comparison, only one of the seventeen patients who had not had a pin-site infection had an infection later around the nail (p = 0.003). An analysis of other variables, including the duration of external fixation, wound coverage, other injuries, and the type of fracture, showed that none was a predictor of infection either at the pin sites or around the intramedullary nail. We concluded that a pin-site infection that develops during external fixation is a contraindication to the subsequent use of reamed intramedullary nailing in patients who have a fracture of the tibia.\r"

Although the course of the transverse geniculate ligament simulated a tear of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus on forty-four (22 per cent) of the sagittal magnetic-resonance scans, no tear of the lateral meniscus was found in the nine patients in this group who had an arthroscopic examination. The normal anatomy of the meniscofemoral ligament varies greatly. The ligament of Humphry, the anterior branch of the meniscofemoral ligament, was visualized on sixty-six (33 per cent) of the magnetic resonance scans. The ligament of Wrisberg, the posterior branch of the meniscofemoral ligament, was identified on sixty-five (32.5 per cent) of the scans. On sagittal images, these ligamentous branches can be mistaken for osteochondral or meniscal fragments. However, a loose body was found in only one of the thirty-two patients who had an arthroscopic examination after the ligament of Humphry or of Wrisberg was seen on the magnetic resonance image. The bursa of the popliteus tendon simulated a tear of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus in fifty-five (27.5 per cent) of the studies, although an actual tear of the posterior horn was found in only two of the eleven patients who had an arthroscopic examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Safranin O-positive hypertrophic chondrocytes that contained proteoglycans were observed in the tissues of each patient. Microcrystals that were suggestive of early precipitation of crystals were found in the degenerating matrix surrounding hypertrophic chondrocytes. The matrix contained electron-dense amorphous material, including proteoglycans and debris of cellular components. The microcrystals were often seen in contact with degenerating collagen fibers. There was never any histological evidence of formation of crystal in the areas that had no hypertrophic chondrocytes. Chondrocytes of this kind, surrounded by characteristic degenerating matrix, were never observed in the articular tissue from sixty-one patients who had only osteoarthritis. On the basis of our results, we speculate that electron-dense amorphous material containing proteoglycans and debris of cellular components, and the degenerating collagen fibers that were seen around the hypertrophic chondrocytes, may play important roles in the formation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals.\r"

More correction was obtained when a derotator apparatus was used. Only one patient had failure of the instrumentation that necessitated additional surgical treatment. All of the arthrodeses resulted in osseous fusion. No patient who had idiopathic scoliosis lost correction (average follow-up, forty-two months; range, thirty to seventy-eight months). There were no serious complications. Lumbar lordosis decreased an average of 24 per cent compared with the preoperative measurement. This decrease was thought to be related to the correction of vertebral rotation in the curve and to the surgical technique.

Of a series of 241 patients (258 hips), sixty-nine patients who were treated with primary cemented Thompson hemiarthroplasty for seventy-two subcapital fractures of the hip were personally interviewed and examined, and radiographs of the hip were made, three to fourteen years after the procedure. The factors that had the highest correlation with the severity of the erosion were the level of physical activity and the duration of follow-up. Erosion through acetabular cartilage into bone developed in thirty-four of the thirty-eight hips in active patients and in none of the thirty-four hips in inactive patients (p less than 0.001). The severity of the erosion increased with time, but only in the hips in active patients, and then it was associated with pain and disability during walking. The patient's age and type of residence (private home or nursing facility) at the time of the fracture were the best predictors of the postoperative level of activity. Patients who were older than seventy years and from nursing homes and those who were older than eighty years and from private homes generally continued to be inactive; in these two groups of patients, the long-term results were good. Of the forty-nine hips in patients who were less than eighty years old and from private homes, thirty-four were in patients who continued to be active.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

More microorganisms were susceptible using the wet disc method compared with the Kirby-Bauer method. The wet disc method could be used to test topical antimicrobial solutions that had no Kirby-Bauer disc equivalent. The wet disc method provided more reliable information for the clinician to use in choosing appropriate topical antimicrobial solutions for treating patients' wounds than the Kirby-Bauer method.\r"

BioBrane is a biosynthetic membrane for use in dressing clean, well-debrided wounds, particularly partial-thickness burns and skin graft donor sites. The close and undisturbed contact of this material with the wound surface is important during the first 2 days after its application to achieve adherence. This has prompted a study to test the relative anchoring strength of four methods of securing the dressing to the normal skin around the wound: 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) Steri-Strips only; Mastisol, a mastic compound, with and without 1/2-inch Steri-Strips; and compound tincture of benzoin, USP, in combination with 1/2-inch Steri-Strips. The results obtained with a tension of 1.1 pounds/square inch (0.5 kg/6.5 cm2) were not conclusive as to the superiority of any one method. However, with a tension of 2.2 pounds/square inch (1 kg/6.5 cm2), the combination of mastic compound and 1/2-inch Steri-Strips provided the strongest adhesion. This type of application should also prove useful when other types of surgical dressings must be anchored in place.\r"

The advantages of this method, including a superior quality reconstruction, limited donor site morbidity, and cost-effectiveness, are discussed. The disadvantages of several operative steps, multiple office visits, and the objectionable appearance during expansion are enumerated. Guidelines for patient selection and technique refinements are also considered to reduce complications and to achieve an optimal functional and aesthetic result.\r"

  ".W": "We have given whole blood as one of the main constituents of burn shock resuscitation for the past 28 years. To appraise the value of using whole blood, we have summarized the clinical experience of 2630 burn patients. Overall mortality was 4.18%. The lethal area of the burn were 50% of the population is expected to die was 82.8% total body surface area and 57.4% third-degree burns. The incidence of renal failure, pulmonary edema, and gastrointestinal bleeding was 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.6% respectively. To confirm the advantage of transfusion of whole blood, we have carried out a series of experimental studies. Two groups of 25 dogs with 25% total body surface area full-thickness burns were treated with two resuscitation regimens. Group I was treated with whole blood, and group II with no blood, during the shock phase. After 48 hours, the infusions were stopped. Measurements were made before the burn and 2, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hours after the burn injury. The animals were then killed for histologic studies. From our data, we concluded that whole blood used in burn shock did not increase hemoconcentration or viscosity; it improved anemia, oncotic pressure, hypoproteinemia, acid-base balance, oxygenation, hemodynamics, and myocardial contractility, promoted cardionatrin secretion, reduced edema of tissue, and protected viscera from degenerative changes and bacterial colonization.\r"

The study consisted of two groups in which each was given a preprocedure dose of the study medication followed by administration of incremental doses up to one half the initial dose as requested. After reviewing the literature, we set the ratio of nalbuphine hydrochloride/morphine sulfate at 2:1 mg, respectively. Safety and efficacy were determined by measurements of vital signs, sedation, adverse effects, and patient evaluation of pain intensity and relief with the use of both an adjective and a visual analogue scale. Analysis showed no significant differences in the variables measured. Therefore in relieving burn debridement pain, we found nalbuphine hydrochloride to be as effective as morphine sulfate. We also found that respiratory depression was not a problem in either group.\r"

Since then, many reports describing this condition in Vietnam War veterans have appeared, as well as occasional reports of the disorder after civilian trauma. We have found only one previous report of this disorder as a sequela to thermal injury. This article presents two illustrative case reports of burn victims suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, highlighting the phenomenology leading to the diagnosis. The treatment and outcome are also presented. The importance of recognizing and treating this disorder in burn victims is discussed. Treatment results in improved compliance through all phases of therapy and an overall decrease in patient morbidity, especially psychologic problems. The need for psychiatric consultation, evaluation, and follow-up of the burn victim is emphasized.\r"

The degree to which the cohesive and elastic bandages reduced range of motion and peak torque of plantar and dorsiflexion was not significantly different. After exercising for 1 hour, the elastic bandage loosens, reducing its ability to immobilize the joint. In contrast, the cohesive bandage maintains its configuration, despite active exercise for 1 hour.\r"

Traditionally most burned extremities were prophylactically splinted to prevent contracture, frequently resulting in patient dependence on the devices. Over the past 10 years a program of acute active exercise training, nonsplinting, independent activities of daily living, and ambulation was established for our burn patients to foster patient independence and responsibility. This program not only consists of the exercise protocols, but it also furthers patient and family education, only occasional intermittent use of splints for maintenance of achieved motion, and the use of antiburn scar supports. This approach has been a successful means of promoting increased patient compliance to physical therapy.\r"

In vivo findings indicate that leaflets in the control group calcify as early as 5 weeks after implantation while treated leaflets showed no significant signs of calcification at this stage. Results deduced from the extractable calcium contents as well as from histological examination, emphasise the need of a blocking reagent to decrease calcification on a valvular bioprosthesis.\r"

Early mortality was 19%, 17.6% and 11.7% in Groups I, II and III respectively (NS), and was not influenced by patients age, number of vessels with critical coronary artery disease and the type of the valve procedure. There was a significant decrease in the release of LDH and AST in Group III when compared with Group II (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.01) respectively. The linearized rate of recurrence of angina (% per patient year) was 0.4, 0.95 and 0.07; and late mortality (% per 100 years) was 5.8, 3.2 and 2.6 in Groups I, II and III respectively.

All patients were in the active phase of infection at the time of surgery. Surgical intervention was performed as an extreme emergency in 21 patients, 10 patients were operated on the next day, and 7 patients underwent elective surgery within 3-4 days. Indications for operation were heart failure alone in 52% of patients, heart failure accompanied by sepsis and emboli in 42% and uncontrolled sepsis in the remaining 6% of patients. The hospital and late mortality was 10.5% and 5.2% respectively. Recurrence of infection and paravalvular regurgitation was only seen in one case. Thus, we believe that the risk of surgical intervention for infective endocarditis can be minimised if operative treatment is carried out early, before advanced haemodynamic and irrevocable valvular deterioration ensues.\r"

Only 10 patients (early in this series) had isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD). Seventeen patients did not survive PAB (25%), including 4 of 5 patients with Taussig-Bing heart (TBH) and only 4 of the 40 patients with VSD [either isolated or associated with coarctation or transposition (TGA)]. Forty-four patients underwent debanding (deB) and secondary cardiac repair at an average age of 22 mo (6-96) and weight of 9.4 kg (4.9-22.0): 9 patients died early and 1 late. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was 49 Torr (27-80) before banding and 24 before deB (6-65). PA stenosis from the band imposed further surgery in all but 15 patients. Thirty-four survivors to secondary repair were followed for an average 46 mo (1-120). Thirty were in NYHA classes I and II. Only 43% of patients with PAB had good medium term results. The presence of the band imposes close, complete follow-up. PAB is no longer recommended for isolated single VSD. It can still be beneficial in multiple, complicated, or medically compromised VSD as well as in very small neonates with atrioventricular septal defect and truncus arteriosus, and subsets of double outlet right ventricle and tricuspid atresia with high pulmonary flow not amenable to early complete repair. PAB in functional single ventricle allows safer delayed definitive repair. TBH and TGA+VSD are now repaired primarily (arterial switch).\r"

Pulmonary hyperperfusion was not present before total repair. Hypoxemia and congestive heart failure quickly abated after surgical ligation of these enlarged bronchial collateral arteries. The patients were totally corrected quite late (at 21 and 22 months respectively) by current standards. It is suggested that: (1) large bronchial collaterals may develop in patients with simple TGA especially if total correction is delayed; (2) preoperative angiographic evaluation of patients with simple TGA who come in for total correction late, should include special aortic root injection to exclude the presence of bronchial collaterals; (3) hypoxemia and pulmonary congestion after total correction of TGA by atrial switch procedure (Mustard or Senning) may in fact be due to bronchial collaterals and not obstruction of the pulmonary veins.\r"

Eleven patients had Tetralogy of Fallot and 3 Transposition of great vessels. Their age ranged between 10 days and 10 years (mean 50.48 +/- 31.82 months). The corrective repair was carried out under CPB with systemic hypothermia (20 degrees-25 degrees C) and intermittent St. Thomas Cardioplegia perfusion in the aortic root until the septal temperature was below 16 degrees C. Three blood samples were taken before, during and 10 minutes after CPB to quantitate the CK and CK-MB. In 6 cases of Fallot, two simultaneous biopsies, one from the right and another from the left ventricular walls were taken at the end of the 10 first minutes of reperfusion to evaluate the ATP, CP and glycogen contents. CK and CK-MB levels showed an increasing evolution; the CK-MB per cent increased sharply after aortic clamp release and then fell abruptly to low values at the 10th minute after CPB arrest. Comparative evaluation between the 3 values for C K showed significant differences (P less than 0.001) in all, except when the first values were compared to the second (P greater than 0.05) and for CK-MB an overall significant differences were found at P less than 0.025 and P less than 0.001. On the other hand, quantification of ATP, CP and glycogen contents from simultaneous biopsies from the left and the right ventricular walls did not demonstrate significant differences between the two ventricles after the ischemic period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This possibility was studied using human right atrial trabeculae contracting isometrically \"in vitro\" in four solutions: Tyrode's (T), autologous arterial blood (B), plasma (P) and denaturated plasma (DP). Complement was activated by the addition of Zymosan while vehicle alone was used as control. Complement activation occurred in the blood and plasma solutions, as assessed by a significant drop in CH50 (p less than 0.05), while there was no detectable complement activity in either T or DP. Myocardial functional integrity was assessed by the change in contractile parameters with time. Subsequent resting forces, relative developed forces (DF), and rates of decay of DF were similar between muscles contracting in the four solutions. We conclude that activated complement has no direct effect on myocardial performance.\r"

Complement activation occurred both via the alternative and classical pathways but the alternative pathway was activated more than the classical with increase in bypass time.

A 4 cm length of carotid artery was excised and replaced by a similar length of the synthetic artery. All implants were performed by the same surgeon (LdeC). Twelve interrupted sutures of 6/0 \"Prolene\" were used to fashion both end-to-end anastomoses. Assessments of patency of the grafts was made using fortnightly Toshiba B scan ultrasound with linked Doppler shift waveform analysis. Twenty-six grafts were implanted. Seventeen grafts have remained patent for periods in excess of 24 months. Five failed acutely (within 2 weeks), 4 failed between the 59th and 201st day. Sixteen of those grafts that remained patent for more than 24 months have been removed for histopathological examination, which has demonstrated a limited extension of a new intima on to the inner surface of the grafts. The new intima is firmly attached and shows no sign of pseudo-intimal hyperplasia. The inner surface, uncovered by neointima, nevertheless, has extensive endothelial cover. Of practical importance are the excellent handling qualities of the graft. It cuts cleanly without fraying and a stitch placed 1 mm from the cut end of the graft will hold securely. There is no needle hole bleeding. The graft has both axial and circumferential compliance similar to that of the natural artery it replaces.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such a very sensitive parameter was found by investigating the surface morphology of circulating platelets. This technique is based on the previous observation that characteristic alterations of platelet morphology are closely associated with the course of the aggregometer tracings. Applying these ultrastructural criteria we investigated 16 patients after distal femoro-popliteal and femoro-crural bypass surgery. Reinforced 6 mm non-seeded PTFE vascular grafts were compared with reversed autologous saphenous vein grafts. As early as 4 hours after graft implantation, a significant higher percentage of discoid platelets with marginal pseudopods--representing the earliest stage of platelet activation--as well as of spheroid \"shape changed\" platelets was found in patients with PTFE grafts. Moreover, perforated platelet membranes were exclusively found in the PTFE group. These findings were most distinguished 10 days postoperatively but persisted over the follow-up period of 1 year. Considering the sensitivity of the described technique it might provide a simple, reliable, and non-invasive means for the clinical assessment of successful graft endothelialization.\r"

To prevent cerebral ischemia during operation, selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) (600 ml/min at 25 degrees C) was employed in 11 patients and hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) at 15 degrees C in 10 patients. There were three early deaths (14.3%) in the series. There were no serious neurologic complications in either group. The present data suggests that both selective cerebral perfusion SCP and HCA are useful methods for cerebral protection during resection of aortic arch aneurysms, although the latter method has the limitation of restricted cerebral arrest time.\r"

A lesion of the external carotid artery may be the source of retinal emboli; patients may benefit from surgical treatment of the lesion. The Authors of the present paper operated on 6 such patients, from a total of 230 carotid bifurcation endarterectomies performed in the period between January 1982 and March 1988. Morbidity and mortality were nil and 5 of the 6 patients are free of symptoms after a mean follow-up period of 23 months. One patient died 2 months after surgery due to a myocardial infarction. On the basis of this experience, the Authors discuss indications, surgical techniques and results of the surgical treatment of lesions obstructing the external carotid artery.\r"

Overall, 34 of 174 (19.5%) had significant variation in CSP which would have affected selective use of a bypass shunt based on CSP criteria. In those with CSP initially below 50 torr, 26 of 76 (34%) rose above 50 torr even, though systemic pressure was constant or declined. Eight of 113 pts (7%) with initial CSP equal to or above 50 torr subsequent had CSP below 50 torr. CSP did not vary as a function of age, sex, intracranial disease judged by biplanar arteriography, or contralateral carotid stenosis but did vary with preoperative status. Asymptomatic patients had CSP above 50 torr in a high proportion of cases, 24 of 27 (89%) unlike those with TIA, 72 of 116 (62%) or prior stroke, 17 of 31 (54%) (P = 0.003).

In an effort to evaluate the safety and efficacy of extracranial carotid reconstructive surgery, we reviewed 3028 operations performed in 2198 patients during the past decade (1977-1986). Operation was recommended because of hemispheric symptoms in 59% of cases. Fourteen percent were advised to have endarterectomy because of an asymptomatic, significant ICA stenosis. Postoperative hemiparesis occurred in 24 patients (1.1%) and was associated with thrombosis at the operative site in 18 patients. Antiplatelet drugs utilized during the last four years were effective in preventing thrombosis at the operative site. Operative mortality during the decade was 1.2%. Follow-up has ranged from one to. 104 months with 86% of the patients alive and 87% symptom free.\r"

This fulfills the requirements for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). In 60 normal persons without symptoms of TOS none had phlebographic signs of venous compression with the arm in normal position. This difference is significant. In the 12 patients TOS was suspected was to be the underlying cause of rethrombosis and first rib resection was performed. Two patients with TOS had rethrombosis before first rib resection could be performed. At follow up 1 to 6 years after the thrombosis no rethrombosis was found. TOS and deep arm vein thrombosis is rare. Controlled studies are not available. We advocate first rib resection in patients with successful fibrinolysis and TOS in order to avoid rethrombosis.\r"

The role of an expanded PTFE surgical membrane (Gortex) as an adjunct to prevent recurrent scarring is discussed.

After initial fluid resuscitation, we operated on each patient by resecting the medial portion of the clavicle. Three of the four patients required further surgery or extension of the incision to control bleeding. In our experience, clavicular resection as a primary approach to exsanguinating injuries did not provide either adequate tamponade of bleeding or the exposure needed to repair injured vessels safely. Clavicular resection may be acceptable for hemodynamically-stable patients with minimal soft tissue damage and simple, right-sided vessel lacerations, but we cannot recommend it as an initial approach in patients with severe, exsanguinating injuries.\r"

  ".W": "A review was conducted of 61 patients who underwent intraoperative balloon dilatation over the past five years. Of the 62 dilatations in this patient group, 80% were performed in conjunction with a reconstructive procedure, and 20% were performed as a primary procedure. Dilatations were performed with the linear extrusion balloon catheter. A 94% rate of followup was achieved, with a mean followup of 16.3 months (range 1-60 months). Life table analysis reveals a 95% initial success rate decreasing to an 81% patency rate by the end of the fifth year for iliac dilatations, a 97% initial and 58% five-year patency rate for superficial femoral dilatations, and an 86% initial and 37% five-year patency rate for popliteal dilatations. 21.3% of the patients died during the followup period. No deaths occurred as a result of intraoperative angioplasty. One arterial rupture occurred, requiring a bypass graft at the same surgery. We conclude that intraoperative balloon dilatation in an adjunctive setting may offer clinical benefits to vascular patients while requiring little additional operative time.\r"

As a result of difficult evacuation facilities at the border, the mean time between injury caused by an anti-personnel mine and admission to the hospital was 8.3 hours (range: 2.5 to 14 hours). However, in 14 patients a penetrating vessel injury was sustained, and these underwent surgical treatment. Peripheral vascular repair was performed in 10 patients. The vessels involved in these reconstructions were: popliteal artery: 4, femoral artery: 2, anterior tibial artery: 3, femoral vein: 1. Vascular repair of the iliac artery and vein was performed in 1 patient. Limb amputation had to be performed in 3 patients, due to the long duration of tourniquet application in these cases. In the field conditions at Khao-I-Dang hospital many surgical facilities normally present in Western hospitals were unavailable. However, our series shows that satisfactory results could be obtained, despite adverse working conditions.\r"

Distal occlusive disease included one or more of the following: (a) stenosis in a named artery of the foot, (b) stenosis of collaterals from the peroneal artery, and (c) incomplete pedal arches. Distal in situ saphenous vein bypass should continue to be broadly applied for limb salvage, but careful judgement in patient selection and attention to the management of the ischemic wound itself remain critical to success.\r"

Particular risk factors for poor wound healing were present in 8 patients, including diabetes, obesity, or poor nutrition in 3 patients; prior radiotherapy to the groin in 2; reoperative groin exposure in 3. Eleven of 14 patients had multiple indications for sartorius flap coverage, including hemorrhage in 5 patients, groin wound sepsis in 3, graft sepsis in 2, wound necrosis in 5, exposure of a reconstruction in 4, treatment of a lymphocele in 1, and treatment of groin irradiation in 2. Nine flaps were proximal sartorius segments rotated into the groin, four were distal muscle reflected into the groin, and one was a mobilized mid-portion of the muscle. Early successful wound healing occurred in all patients, but complications included muscle bed infection in 1 patient, late recurrence of lymphocele in 1, and recurrent groin sepsis in 1. Hemorrhage did not recur, and existing reconstructions were salvaged in all patients. The sartorius flap is a well-tolerated method for achieving autogenous tissue coverage for the problem groin wound, and there is no long-term functional deficit from anatomic loss of the sartorius muscle.\r"

In the thrombectomy group (43 limbs), the cumulative incidence of pigmentation at the 15th year was 15%, but no stasis ulcers occurred throughout the follow-up period. In the conservative treatment group (53 limbs), the cumulative incidence of pigmentation at the 15th year was 41%, and that of stasis ulceration was 27%. Fogarty thrombectomy restricted below the pelvic vein spur and removal of thrombi in the leg veins by manual milking is sufficient to relieve early morbidity, preserve venous valve function, and promote intrapelvic collateral circulation. Preservation of venous valves in the femoropopliteal region is a key to the prevention of postthrombotic syndrome. Thrombectomy within 5 days of the onset of symptoms is recommended for patients with iliofemoropopliteal venous thrombosis.\r"

Pure oxygen bubbles emerge from the perfluorodecalin, and dissolved oxygen levels reach 35% by volume within 60 minutes. The solution is placed in a bath once or twice a day for 2-3 hours and pure oxygen is allowed to bubble through it (3-5 1/min). Nine patients were treated by this technique. Drugs which seemed to have an effect on ischemic ulcers were not used during the treatment. Ischemic ulcers in three patients (5 X 5 mm, 23 X 6 mm and 10 X 5 mm) healed completely within two weeks and there were no recurrences. In six patients, the ulcers showed 30-70% reductions in size within 4 to 14 days. Four of them later underwent arterial reconstruction, which resulted in complete healing of the ulcers. In two patients, the ulcers reverted to their former size 6 to 12 months after the cessation of perfluorodecalin bath therapy.\r"

Following the pulmonary surgery the patient sustained a massive aortic occlusion by a tumor embolus, that was removed by bilateral femoral embolectomies. Three additional documented episodes of peripheral arterial emboli subsequently took place, two of which were tumoral. One tumor embolus into the carotid artery territory eventually caused metastatic spread in the brain. All peripheral emboli were successfully treated by embolectomy. This unique display of multiple tumor emboli, following lung resection for carcinoma, reemphasises the significance of early interruption of the pulmonary vein, in an attempt to reduce the incidence of tumor emboli.\r"

Dapsone therapy was effective in controlling the swelling. Examination of skin biopsy specimens showed fragmentation and almost total loss of elastic fibers in the areas of cutis laxa. Electron microscopy showed no abnormalities in elastic structure and function in unaffected skin. In addition, electron microscopic examination of an urticarial lesion showed a neutrophilic dermatosis with polymorphonuclear leukocytes attached to the surface of either normal elastic fibers or fibers showing early degenerative changes. These findings suggest that there is no primary defect in the elastic fibers and that the polymorphonuclear leukocytes play a significant role in the destruction of the elastic fibers and the subsequent development of cutis laxa in this case.\r"

Using different methods, we compared six commercially available sunscreens to determine the UVA protection factor and, thus, to select the most appropriate sunscreen. Two clinical methods on human skin (inhibition of UVA-induced tanning with the use of a high-intensity UVA source and inhibition of methoxsalen plus UVA-induced phototoxicity) were compared with a method in animals (inhibition of UVA-induced sunburn cell production in mice treated with methoxsalen) and with two in vitro techniques (solution-dilution and sandwich spectrophotometry). We conclude that all five methods used give a quantitative estimate of UVA protection, but none can be accepted as a standard because the UVA protection factor varies according to the method used and the reading time.\r"

  ".W": "Our studies of mononuclear leukocyte peripheral blood homogenates demonstrate significantly increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase activity in patients with atopic dermatitis who were untreated for 1 week, compared with normal adult nonatopic control subjects. Phosphodiesterase activity is not related to the extent or activity of the patient's disease or the presence or absence of allergic respiratory disease. Enzyme kinetic studies showed a triphasic plot in normal mononuclear leukocytes but a biphasic plot in atopic dermatitis. This may be interpreted as an absence of an enzyme with a low (0.080) Michaelis Menton constant (Km) in atopic dermatitis samples. One week of therapy with a topical fluorinated steroid ointment caused a significant reduction in disease activity. Although a slight reduction in mean total phosphodiesterase activity occurred, it did not reach statistical significance. One week's treatment, however, caused the abnormal biphasic kinetic plot to revert to a triphasic plot with return of the low Km enzyme form in those patients who showed a fall in phosphodiesterase activity. This finding suggests that the elevated phosphodiesterase activity in atopic dermatitis may be responsive in a limited degree to topical steroid therapy.\r"

These features are characteristic for an arteriovenous hemangioma, also called cirsoid aneurysm. The distal part of the tumor showed nearly total fibrosis and at the proximal end of the tumor signs of incipient basal cell carcinoma were observed. In spite of the accelerated growth, unusual size, and the presence of a basal cell carcinoma at the base of this tumor, giant cirsoid aneurysms appear to be of a benign nature and thus conservative, nonradical surgical treatment can be performed. The tumor was removed by argon laser surgery with excellent results and no sign of recurrence after 1 year.\r"

Goal Attainment Scaling is a procedure for quantifying change over time, in five categories varying from \"less than expected\" success to \"more than expected\" success. The sample consisted of 60 enlisted military personnel who had indicated, on a screening questionnaire, their desire to improve dietary practices. The subjects were assigned to three groups but remained unaware throughout the study that nutrition was being investigated. The Goal-Setting/Goal Attainment group (GSGA, no. = 19) received a full 8-week health promotion program, based on goal-setting, fitness information, and skill development (12 sessions). The Goal-Setting group (GS, no. = 19) received only the part of the program that focused on setting goals (two sessions). The control group (no. = 22) received no instruction. Results from analysis of variance indicated that GSGA had significantly higher \"Change Scores\" in nutrition-related behaviors than the control group (p less than .05); \"Change Scores\" reflect degree of dietary improvement. Frequency data indicate that dietary improvements were sustained for 84% of the GSGA members, 64% of the GS members, and 37% in the control group. These findings suggest goal-setting skills enhance individuals' capabilities for making and maintaining improvements in nutrition-related behaviors.\r"

Sixty percent of the respondents indicated that they provided nutrition information to their patients on a routine basis, and 38% provided information on request only. The major forms of nutrition information dissemination were counseling (87%) and written materials (74%). The majority of respondents reported that they diagnose osteoporosis, arthritis, and allergies and use nutrition treatments for those disorders as a part of overall therapy. Chiropractic journals and texts were the most frequently used sources of nutrition information. Awareness of the educational backgrounds of registered dietitians correlated positively with the use of dietitians as a resource for nutrition information (p less than .005).

Skyler et al. have proposed algorithms for patients to adjust their insulin dosage when blood sugar is elevated. However, the clinical result of increasing insulin dosage may be the promotion of weight gain. We proposed that altering the regimen by decreasing caloric intake is an appropriate first approach for NIDDM patients for whom weight loss would be of considerable benefit. Results of an initial needs assessment showed that patients did not generally regard testing and adjusting therapy as important in taking care of diabetes. A recent study by Fox et al. reported similar results, showing that a large portion of patients using blood glucose self-monitoring do not make changes in their regimen when they know that their blood sugar is elevated. Consequently, we implemented a half-day seminar to instruct patients on making adjustments in their dietary regimen on the basis of results of glucose monitoring. Results suggest that our teaching methods were effective in teaching patients to follow the adjusting algorithm. Although we observed trends toward improved metabolic control and weight loss, further studies are required to document the clinical benefit of adjustment of caloric intake based on self-monitoring in diabetes.\r"

Moreover, our data support the findings of Rapp, which show inaccurate portion estimation even when subjects were actively involved in a diet counseling program. And, in general, our data support researchers who have concluded that inaccurate estimation of portion size is a major problem. If the results hold true across populations, the magnitude of errors could have a profound effect on the accuracy of our food composition data for therapeutic or monitoring purposes and requires creative modification of methods taught for monitoring and reporting food intake.\r"
