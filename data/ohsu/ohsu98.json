An exercise-induced transient, bilateral, hippurate transport disturbance was sought as an expression of an exercise-mediated cortical perfusion abnormality. The study sought to test the hypothesis that patients who present evidence for an exercise-induced renal perfusion disturbance would have stabilized hypertension that was no longer surgically curable because of morphological changes of the peripheral vasculature. All 18 patients continued on to therapy: 13 proceeded to renovascular reconstructive surgery, 2 had a unilateral nephrectomy, and 3 were treated with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty. During preoperative exercise renography, evidence of bilateral renal dysfunction developed in 10 of 18 hypertensive patients during ergometric stress (abnormal exercise response). Following surgical therapy nine of these patients with abnormal exercise scintigrams continued to have hypertensive disease, while one patient was cured. The exercise renograms of eight hypertensive patients were not influenced by the exercise protocol, and operation cured seven of these eight patients. The results suggest that an accentuated vascular response to exercise occurs in the maintenance phase of renovascular hypertension, a disturbance not observed while the hypertension is curable by surgical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "An exercise-mediated renal omicron-iodohippurate transport abnormality was recently identified in patients with hypertension. The disturbance was not observed in normotensive controls. To learn more about this transient functional disturbance of the kidney, we obtained gamma camera hippurate renograms in 45 patients with hypertension. The final diagnoses indicated that 27 patients had essential hypertension, 15 had renal parenchymal or renovascular hypertension, 2 had malignant hypertension, and 1 had hypertension of pregnancy. We documented age, height, weight, global and unilateral renal function, blood pressure status, and antihypertensive medication used at time of scintigraphy. We also noted the serum catecholamine, sodium, and potassium levels. All patients were scintigraphed at rest and during exercise. The scintigraphic examination documented exercise-induced renal dysfunction in 28 (62%) patients (abnormal exercise renogram), while 17 (38%) had renograms not noticeably influenced by the exercise protocol (normal exercise renogram). When the results of scintigraphy were compared with the clinical data, a weak correlation was found between patient overweight and an abnormal response to exercise. There was no significant difference between groups with normal and abnormal exercise renograms with respect to the other parameters assessed. Exercise renography was not useful for differentiating renal and essential hypertension. Renography appears to demonstrate an exercise-mediated, transient, renal perfusion disturbance in certain patients with hypertension. The examination appears to assess a new parameter in hypertensive disease. Thus, the gamma camera renogram should be reevaluated in the patient with hypertension.\r"

To examine the hypothesis that abnormalities in the monoaminergic innervation of the hypothalamus and brainstem contribute to the NaCl-induced exacerbation of hypertension, the monoamine and monoamine metabolite contents of specific hypothalamic and brainstem regions thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension were determined in SHR fed a diet containing 8% or 1% NaCl for either 2 or 6 weeks beginning at age 8 weeks. SHR maintained on the 8% NaCl diet for 2 weeks displayed significant decreases in norepinephrine in both the anterior and posterior hypothalamic regions but not in other brainstem or hypothalamic regions, as compared with animals consuming 1% NaCl. In addition, stores of the principal terminal norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol were reduced in the anterior hypothalamic region of SHR fed an 8% NaCl diet for 2 weeks. After 6 weeks on the diets, SHR fed 8% NaCl showed small but statistically nonsignificant reductions in norepinephrine stores of the anterior hypothalamic region as compared with SHR fed a basal diet, while WKY fed 8% NaCl had significantly elevated norepinephrine stores in the anterior hypothalamic region as compared with WKY fed a basal diet. There was a significant group X diet interaction (p less than 0.05). After 6 weeks on the 8% NaCl diet, SHR (but not WKY) displayed a significant reduction in norepinephrine content of the posterior hypothalamic region. No NaCl-induced differences in norepinephrine stores were found in the pons or medulla of either strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The release of 5-hydroxytryptamine from the vascular adrenergic nerve by periarterial nerve stimulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was compared with that in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The isolated mesenteric vascular bed was perfused at a constant flow rate of 5 ml/min. Vasoconstrictor responses to periarterial nerve stimulation (4, 8, 12, and 16 Hz for 30 seconds) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (1 microM), but not norepinephrine (1 nmol), were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. After treatment with 5-hydroxytryptamine (1 microM) for 15 minutes, vasoconstrictor responses to periarterial nerve stimulation previously reduced by prazosin (50 nM) were restored and a frequency-dependent pressor response reappeared. However, 5-HT treatment did not significantly affect the pressor response to exogenously administered norepinephrine (1 nmol), which was previously inhibited by prazosin. The degree of the restoration in SHR was significantly greater than that in WKY at all frequencies used. The restoration of the pressor response to periarterial nerve stimulation after 5-hydroxytryptamine treatment did not occur in the presence of the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptor antagonists ketanserin (10 nM) or LY53857 (10 nM). In the perfused mesenteric vascular bed of both WKY and SHR prelabeled with [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine, periarterial nerve stimulation (4-16 Hz) evoked a frequency-dependent increase in tritium efflux that was abolished by Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer solution or tetrodotoxin (100 nM) and treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine. The tritium efflux evoked by periarterial nerve stimulation was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY at all frequencies used. These results suggest that the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine from adrenergic nerve endings by periarterial nerve stimulation is enhanced in the mesenteric vascular bed of the SHR.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal sympathectomy of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) was performed by a combined treatment with antiserum to nerve growth factor and guanethidine during the first 4 weeks after birth. The development of hypertension was completely prevented in the treated SHR: at 28 to 30 weeks of age, systolic blood pressure of treated SHR was 139 +/- 2 mm Hg as compared with 195 +/- 8 mm Hg in untreated SHR. The extent of sympathectomy was verified by histofluorescence. Fluorescence histochemistry for catecholamine-containing nerves showed a complete absence of adrenergic nerves in the mesenteric arteries of treated rats. A supersensitivity to norepinephrine was exhibited by mesenteric arteries, anococcygeus muscle, and tail arteries from the treated SHR and WKY. In the mesenteric vascular bed, maximal response to norepinephrine was significantly reduced by sympathectomy. Sympathectomy also abolished the responses (e.g., generation of excitatory junctional potentials) of tail arteries to electrical stimulation of perivascular nerves. Morphometric measurements of three categories of mesenteric arteries showed that sympathectomy had no effect on the hypertrophic change of smooth muscle cells in the conducting vessels, but it prevented the hyperplastic changes of the muscle cells from reactive, muscular arteries and small resistance vessels. These results suggest that one of the primary roles of the overactive sympathetic nervous system in the development of hypertension in SHR is manifested through its trophic effect on the arteries of SHR. This trophic effect appears to cause a hyperplastic change in the smooth muscle cells in the reactive and resistance vessels, thereby contributing to the development of hypertension in older SHR.\r"

Since noninvasive techniques are useful for the longitudinal evaluation of these animals, we sought to critically asses the M-mode echocardiographic estimation of left ventricular mass in the baboon and to characterize estimates of left ventricular size and function in baboons with chronic renal hypertension. In 23 baboons (12 normotensive, 11 chronic hypertensive), M-mode echocardiography-determined left ventricular mass was 73 +/- 13 (SE) g as compared with the necropsy weight of 69 +/- 11 g (p = NS), and the correlation was excellent (r = 0.94). When 30 chronically hypertensive baboons being observed longitudinally were compared with 10 normotensive control animals studied under identical conditions, several differences were noted in measures derived from echocardiography and high fidelity pressure measurements. Left ventricular systolic pressure was considerably higher in the hypertensive baboons (113 +/- 23 vs 90 +/- 11 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), as was left ventricular mass (148 +/- 60 vs 103 +/- 38 g; p less than 0.03). However, since the ratio of posterior wall thickness to cavity dimension was larger in the hypertensive baboons (0.52 +/- 0.17 vs 0.43 +/- 0.07; p less than 0.05), this concentric hypertrophy maintained values for left ventricular meridional stress at the same level as in the control animals. Despite matched heart rate and left ventricular stress, the rates of change in left ventricular dimensions and wall thickness in systole and diastole were all approximately 25% less in the hypertrophied baboons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arginine vasopressin caused transient hypertension and tachycardia in Wistar-Kyoto rats, whereas it induced delayed hypotension and bradycardia in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effects on the latter lasted for 24 to 72 hours after cessation of the infusion. Intravenous administration of arginine vasopressin at a rate of 2 pg/kg/min did not cause any change in blood pressure and heart rate in these rats. These results suggest that arginine vasopressin acts centrally to depress cardiovascular activities, at least in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

Much of the confusion surrounding its natural history, response to therapy, and anaplastic transformation may be ascribed to the failure of critically reviewing accepted diagnostic criteria. A series of 44 patients with verrucous carcinoma of the larynx is presented, 18 of these being updated results of previously reported patients. Ackerman's tumor, although not radioresistant, seems less radiosensitive than ordinary squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor's rounded, pushing margins and inability to metastasize would seem to favor endoscopic removal, saving partial laryngectomy procedures for those lesions that cannot be managed endoscopically. Extensive lesions that would require total laryngectomy for complete removal of the tumor should be treated by primary radiotherapy. It is our belief that total laryngectomy should only be performed in large lesions that fail to respond to radiotherapy and whenever medical considerations preclude partial laryngectomy procedures.\r"

Elective lymphadenectomy was performed in about one-third, all but one of whom had either T2 or T3 primaries or a surgical approach that involved entry into the neck. The determinate \"cure\" rate at 24 mo (median follow-up 50 mo) was 86%. Ninety-three percent and 78%, respectively, of those with T1 and T2 lesions remained alive and well after conservative operations, which yielded good functional results. Uncontrolled neck disease was evident in 10 of the 13 determinate patients who died as a result of their tumor. Although more of our patients with localized oral cancer now undergo elective lymphadenectomy when the primary is resected, T staging has not accurately predicted which patients are at greatest risk of metastasis. Preliminary data suggest that measurement of tumor depth may be a better way to select those patients who need elective neck therapy.\r"

Manofluorography (mano, manometry; fluoro, videofluoroscopy; graphy, picture) is a new technique that permits analysis of simultaneous manometry and videofluoroscopy of deglutition. Manofluorography provides more detailed analysis of the swallowing dynamics during the pharyngeal stage of deglutition than either barium studies or manometry used alone. This study uses manofluorography to examine swallowing in two patient groups, total laryngectomees and total laryngectomees with tongue impairment, to analyze the role of various anatomic components in the swallowing process. Pharyngeal transit times were prolonged in both patient groups studied, with the tongue impairment group exhibiting the longest times. The postlaryngectomy pharynx offered greater resistance to bolus flow. The laryngectomy patients compensated by using increased lingual propulsion, whereas the patients with tongue impairment and total laryngectomy could not. This emphasizes the importance of the tongue in bolus propulsion in the pharynx. Other postoperative changes in swallowing are discussed.\r"

Based on a recent anatomic description, a technique was devised to preserve the distal accessory nerve; the theory advanced was that the trapezius was supplied by motor fibers from the cervical plexus, which join the accessory nerve in the posterior triangle. Dissections were performed on 23 cadavers to test such a theory. The course of the accessory nerve in the neck was mapped in each dissection, and landmarks for use during surgery determined. Cervical contributions to the nerve usually joined deep to the sternocleidomastoid, and not in the posterior triangle. Branches from the cervical plexus, independent of the accessory nerve, entered the trapezius in the posterior triangle. None of the bilateral dissections showed symmetry of the cervical contributions.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 113 patients with malignant salivary gland tumors was retrospectively reviewed to analyze the association of clinical and histologic factors with survival. These factors were patient sex and age, tumor site, clinical stage, histologic diagnosis, tumor grade, and whether or not final surgical margins were clear. There were 57 parotid, 40 minor salivary, and 16 submandibular gland cancers. The histologic groups were mucoepidermoid carcinoma (49 patients), adenoid cystic carcinoma (31), adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (18), acinic cell carcinoma (7), malignant mixed tumor (5), squamous cell carcinoma (2), and undifferentiated carcinoma (1). Univariate analysis of clinical factors showed that age and clinical stage significantly influenced survival. At 10 yr the predicted cumulative survival rates for Stage I, II, III, and IV tumors were 74%, 56%, 32%, and 10%, respectively. Tumor grade was the only significant histologic factor. This was most obviously reflected among patients with mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Cumulative survival at 5 yr was 94% for those with low-grade tumors and 26% for high-grade tumors. By multivariate analysis, clinical stage, age, and tumor grade remained highly significant. Analysis of patients with only Stage I and II disease demonstrated that the significant factors were patient age, tumor site, tumor grade, and whether or not surgical clearance was achieved. These results suggest that clinical stage should not be the exclusive determinant of the extent of surgery and that the selection of patients, for adjuvant therapy may be improved by an awareness of these prognostic factors.\r"

This approach is different from most of the previously described approaches in that it uses a preauricular incision, preserves the facial nerve, and avoids the mastoid bone. It involves dividing the zygomatic arch and displacing it inferiorly, dividing the malar eminence (zygoma) and displacing it anteriorly, and cutting the coronoid process and retracting it superiorly with the attached temporalis muscle. Reconstruction is accomplished by using the temporalis muscle or a pericranial flap to cover the dura, a free fat graft to fill the space left by tumor excision, and by wiring the zygomatic arch and malar eminence into their original positions. Case reports of both benign and malignant lesions are presented.\r"

This study uses manofluorography to analyze the swallowing patterns of nine patients who had undergone supraglottic laryngectomy. The results show that during swallowing the pharyngeal mechanism for preventing aspiration depends upon three processes: (1) tight lingual-laryngeal contact, (2) coordination of the swallowing reflex, and (3) tongue base and pharyngeal constrictor clearing of the hypopharynx and laryngeal inlet. Anterior suspension of the larynx under the tongue base serves to improve lingual-laryngeal contact. This close contact during deglutition protects the airway from the bolus and also opens the postcricoid region, aiding bolus passage into the esophagus. Impairment of the swallowing reflex, which can cause severe aspiration before the swallowing reflex is triggered, can be rehabilitated by swallowing therapy. Minor aspiration is commonly caused by impaired clearing of the superior hypopharynx after supraglottic laryngectomy.\r"

Despite total parotidectomy in most cases and radiotherapy in all, most patients have succumbed to their tumors, six with distant metastases.

Fifteen of 22 had clinical evidence of facial nerve injury ranging from mild paresis to complete paralysis. The high resolution CT scan analysis identified a characteristic fracture of the temporal bone in every patient with facial nerve injury. A high percentage of these fractures (68%) could be classified as mixed and did not fall into a longitudinal or transverse fracture category. The characteristic fracture extends from the petrotympanic fissure at the glenoid fossa to the anterior inferior aspect of the medial bony external auditory canal. It resumes at the superior aspect of the external auditory canal (scutum) extending laterally along the external canal wall. If the vector force of the fracture is projected medially, it will cross the facial nerve in its horizontal portion. Often, the evaluation of trauma patients with routine CT scans for central nervous system (CNS) (brain) evaluation is inadequate for evaluation of temporal bone fractures. A high resolution CT scan should be performed when clinical criteria warrant its use. It is recognized that the incidence of facial nerve injury may be higher in this select population.\r"

MacFee incisions were used in 50 of these; in the remaining 50 a variety of other incisions were used. With MacFee incisions no ischemic tissue loss resulted. By contrast, six patients (12%) in the comparison group experienced partial flap necrosis due to ischemia. Chi-square analysis shows this difference to be statistically significant (P less than 0.01). This study shows the bipedicled cervical flap to be durable, dependable, and sufficiently vascularized to prevent ischemic tissue loss, even when incisions were previously placed in the ipsilateral neck or antecedent radiation therapy was delivered.\r"

A retrospective review of medical records from 1955 to 1985 was undertaken to determine the incidence of occurrence and to assess the outcome of the therapy provided. One hundred seventy-eight minor salivary gland tumors of the oral cavity and oropharynx were identified, of which 22 (13%) were located in the tongue base. All were malignant. The most common histologic type was mucoepidermoid carcinoma (10 patients), followed by adenocarcinoma (6 patients), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (6 patients). Thirteen patients were available for a mean follow-up of 5 years. Treatment was most often a combination of wide resection combined with postoperative radiation therapy. Ten patients (77%) are alive, one with persistent disease 8 years after diagnosis. Three patients died within 2 years of diagnosis, one with intercurrent disease. Improved control of disease in this series, when compared to previously reported series, is attributed to adequate surgical therapy and adjuvant radiotherapy. The deaths in our series occurred in patients who were unable to proceed with the recommended therapy. These unusual lesions require aggressive multimodality treatment for improved survival.\r"

We assessed the relationship between reflex stimulus, i.e., changes in central venous pressure (CVP) and response, i.e., FVR, during selective unloading of the cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors with lower body negative pressure (0 to -20 mmHg). The linear relationship between FVR and CVP, the gain of this baroreflex, was significantly diminished in the F subjects, -2.42 +/- 0.57 U/mmHg, compared with the UF, -5.15 +/- 0.58 U/mmHg. Both groups, F and UF, had similar resting values for CVP and FVR; thus the diminished gain in F subjects was not simply an artifact resulting from a shift of the set point along the baroreflex stimulus-response curve. We also found a linear relationship between baroreflex gain and total blood volume (r = 0.59, P less than 0.05). We conclude that the gain of this vascular reflex is attenuated in trained individuals and is related to cardiovascular adaptations, such as an increased blood volume, associated with exercise training.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine whether lung injury after a period of ischemia reperfusion is caused by O2 ventilation during ischemia and whether this injury is mediated by reactive O2 metabolites. Isolated canine left lower pulmonary lobes were subjected to room temperature ischemia for 6 h while being ventilated with either 100% O2, room air, or 100% N2. After the ischemic period, all lobes were perfused with autologous blood and ventilated with 100% O2 for an additional 4 h. In lobes ventilated with 100% O2 during the ischemic period, massive weight gain (228%) occurred 4 h after reperfusion. A marked increase in pulmonary shunt was noted. Lobes ventilated with room air behaved similarly. In contrast, lobes ventilated with 100% N2 gained significantly less weight (54%) and did not manifest any increase in pulmonary shunt. When lobes ventilated with 100% O2 or room air were pretreated with superoxide dismutase (SOD), the injury was significantly reduced. Pressure-volume deflation study of lobes, after ischemia only, demonstrated that ventilation with 100% O2 and with 100% N2 both equally decreased pulmonary compliance. We conclude that lung ischemia-reperfusion injury is related to O2 ventilation during ischemia and that injury can be prevented by administration of SOD or ventilation with 100% N2. This suggests that the injury is related to O2 metabolites produced during O2 ventilation in the absence of the circulation.\r"

To investigate this, the intra-arterial blood pressure response of four body builders (BB), six novice weight-trained individuals (NT), and six sedentary controls (SC) were monitored during performance of one-arm overhead presses and one-leg knee extensions. One repetition at the maximal weight possible (1 RM) and sets to voluntary fatigue at 90, 80, 70, and 50% of 1 RM were performed. Across groups, the BB demonstrated a significantly (P less than 0.05) lower peak and a lesser magnitude of response (changes from rest to peak) for systolic and diastolic blood pressures than the the NT and SC groups during both exercises. The BB also demonstrated significantly lower values across groups for peak heart rate and magnitude of heart rate response during arm presses. During knee extensions across groups, peak heart rate but not magnitude of the heart rate response was significantly lower in the BB. The results indicate that previous weight-training experience reduces the pressor response to dynamic resistance exercises.\r"

Muscle and blood samples were also collected during 60 min of recovery. After exercise muscle ATP contents were decreased by 30 +/- 7 (SD) and 47 +/- 3% after the 800- and 2,000-m gallops, respectively. As indicators of purine catabolism, ammonia and uric acid increased in plasma, the accumulation being greater after the 2,000-m gallop. Blood ammonia peaked immediately after exercise and uric acid after 40-60 min of recovery. Muscle glycogen utilization over the 800- and 2,000-m gallops averaged 2.68 +/- 0.90 and 1.06 +/- 0.12 mmol glucosyl units.kg dry muscle-1.s-1, respectively, and the total used amounted to 27.3 +/- 6.6 and 32.5 +/- 8.8% of the initial store. Muscle lactate accumulation averaged 123.5 +/- 49.7 and 167.3 +/- 20.7 mmol/kg dry muscle, respectively, and declined during recovery with half times of 22.9 +/- 4.2 and 18.9 +/- 6.6 min. Blood lactate peaked 5-10 min after exercise. Exercise resulted in only a small increase in muscle glycerol content, but this continued to rise during recovery reaching 9-12 mmol/kg dry muscle after 20 min. During this time the increase in muscle glycerol content exactly matched the decline in glycerol 3-phosphate.\r"

After differences in gas temperature and humidity were taken into account, the data were in agreement up to 15 Hz with a simple second-order model including an airway compartment, with a resistance and an inertance, and a shunt compliance representing alveolar gas. At larger frequencies, closer inspection revealed that a third-order model was optimal. We interpret these results as indicating a compartmentalization of gas compliance within the thorax, communicating via a resistive element. Airway inertance did not seem to be distributed.\r"

The time course of soleus muscle recovery (R) was also examined after 28 days of hindlimb unweighting with an additional 4, 8, 16, and 28 days of unrestricted cage activity. During suspension, soleus muscle myofibril protein rapidly decreased from 34.3 +/- 3.1 (1.96SE) mg/pair in the control (C) group to 6.9 +/- 1.4 (1.96SE) mg/pair in S (t = 56 days). The calculated first-order degradation rate constant for this loss was kd = 0.17 days-1 [half time (t1/2) = 4.1 days]. The estimated slow myosin (SM) isoform content decreased from 13.4 +/- 2.0 (1.96SE) mg/pair in C to 2.1 +/- 0.2 (1.96SE) mg/pair in S (kd = 0.19 days-1, t1/2 = 3.6 days). The relative proportion of other myosin isoforms was increased at 28 and 56 days of suspension, reflecting an apparent de novo synthesis and the loss of SM. Recovery of contractile protein after 28 days of suspension was slower for both the myofibril protein and the SM isoform (kd = 0.07 days-1, t1/2 = 10 days). These data suggest that loss of weight bearing specifically affected the mechanisms of contractile protein expression reflected in soleus muscle protein degradation processes. In addition, the expression of the myosin isoforms were apparently differentially affected by the loss of weight-bearing activity.\r"

We also examined the effect of uphill running during the last 4 wk of an 8-wk hindlimb unweighting program and during 4 wk of cage recovery after 4 wk of hindlimb unweighting. All forms of activity partially spared soleus muscle weight (mg), myofibril protein (mg/muscle pair and microgram/mg muscle), and relative and absolute slow myosin (SM) isoform content (% of total and mg/muscle pair, P less than 0.05). Relative to the normal control soleus muscle, the uphill running regimens resulted in 1) increased fast myosin isoform content and 2) diminished recovery of SM isoform content when coupled with cage activity recovery. Four weeks of cage recovery after 4 wk of hindlimb unweighting resulted in recovery of the relative SM isoform content to proportions exceeding normal control values, suggesting an apparent degradation of any normally existing fast myosin. These results indicate that, in the context of the hindlimb unweighting model, the mechanisms controlling the expression of soleus muscle SM and fast myosin genes can be affected differently by the diverse activities of stationary ground support, unrestricted cage activity, and programmed uphill running.\r"

Although these lung cells have intracellular antioxidants, these defenses may be insufficient to protect the epithelial surface against oxidants present at the alveolar surface. This study demonstrates that the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the lower respiratory tract contains large amounts of the sulfhydryl-containing antioxidant glutathione (GSH). The total glutathione (the reduced form GSH and the disulfide GSSG) concentration of normal ELF was 140-fold higher than that in plasma of the same individuals, and 96% of the glutathione in ELF was in the reduced form. Compared with nonsmokers, cigarette smokers had 80% higher levels of ELF total glutathione, 98% of which was in the reduced form. Studies of cultured lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts demonstrated that these concentrations of reduced glutathione were sufficient to protect these cells against the burden of H2O2 in the range released by alveolar macrophages removed from the lower respiratory tract of nonsmokers and smokers, respectively, suggesting that the glutathione present in the alveolar ELF of normal individuals likely contributes to the protective screen against oxidants in the extracellular milieu of the lower respiratory tract.\r"

Force generation was well preserved during continuous contraction but successively decreased after 20 s of intermittent stimulation down to 50% of initial at end of work. The energy cost per unit work was greater during intermittent stimulation and increased with contraction time, whereas it decreased with time during continuous stimulation. The decrease in force generation in intermittent exercise is suggested to be due to the higher energy cost for contraction resulting in greater changes in the intracellular environment with lower ATP and increased H+ and Pi. These changes would decrease both activation of the contractile system and the cross-bridge turnover rate resulting from activation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the increment in cardiac output and in O2 consumption (Vo2) from quiet breathing to maximal sustained ventilation, Vo2 and cardiac output were measured using an acetylene rebreathing technique in five subjects. Cardiac output and Vo2 were measured multiple times in each subject at rest and during sustained maximal ventilation. During maximal ventilation subjects breathed 5% CO2 to prevent hypocapnia. The increase in cardiac output from rest to maximal breathing was taken as an estimate of respiratory muscle blood flow and was used to calculate the arteriovenous O2 content difference across the respiratory muscles from the Fick equation. Cardiac output increased by 4.3 +/- 1.0 l/min (mean +/- SD), from 5.6 +/- 0.7 l/min at rest to 9.9 +/- 1.1 l/min, during maximal ventilations ranging from 127 to 193 l/min. Vo2 increased from 312 +/- 29 to 723 +/- 69 ml/min during maximal ventilation. O2 extraction across the respiratory muscles during maximal breathing was 9.6 +/- 1.0 vol% (range 8.5 to 10.7 vol%). These values suggest an upper limit of respiratory muscle blood flow of 3-5 l/min during unloaded maximal sustained ventilation.\r"

To investigate whether inspiring O2 alters ventilatory muscle recruitment and improves exercise endurance, we recorded pleural (Ppl) and gastric (Pga) pressures while breathing air or 30% O2 during leg cycling in six patients with severe CAO, mild hypoxemia, and minimal arterial O2 desaturation with exercise. At rest, mean (+/- SD) transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was lower inspiring 30% O2 compared with air (23 +/- 4 vs. 26 +/- 7 cmH2O, P less than 0.05), but the pattern of Ppl and Pga contraction was identical while breathing either gas mixture. Maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure was similar breathing air or 30% O2 (84 +/- 30 vs. 77 +/- 30 cmH2O). During exercise, Pdi increased similarly while breathing air or 30% O2, but the latter was associated with a significant increase in peak inspiratory Pga and decreases in peak inspiratory Ppl and expiratory Pga. In five out of six patients, exercise endurance increased with O2 (671 +/- 365 vs. 362 +/- 227 s, P less than 0.05). We conclude that exercise with O2 alters ventilatory muscle recruitment and increases exercise endurance. During exercise inspiring O2, the diaphragm performs more ventilatory work which may prevent overloading the accessory muscles of respiration.\r"

Chest wall recoil pressure was measured over a range of lung volumes in each subject and was used as the reference pressure in the calculation of work rate. There was little change in elastic or resistive work rate at rest when vagal tone was reduced by ipratropium. The mean work at 40, 60, and 80 l/min was 8.9, 17.2, and 34.0 cmH2O.l-1.s before and 5.6, 12.4 and 25.8 cmH2O.l-1.s after ipratropium.

To evaluate this source of error, we compared rebreathing Qc with invasive measurements of cardiac output performed by indicator-dilution methods (COID) in 39 patients with cardiac or pulmonary diseases. In 16 patients with normal lung volumes and 1-s forced expiratory volumes (FEV1), Qc measured with acetylene [Qc(C2H2)] overestimated COID insignificantly by 2 +/- 9% (SD). In subjects with mild to moderate obstructive lung disease, Qc(C2H2) slightly overestimated COID by 6 +/- 15% (P = 0.11). In patients with restrictive disease or combined obstructive and restrictive disease, Qc(C2H2) underestimated COID significantly by 9 +/- 14% (P less than 0.04). The magnitude of the discrepancy between Qc and COID correlated with size of the volume rebreathed and an index of uneven ventilation calculated from helium mixing during rebreathing that determined a dead space to inspired volume ratio (VRD/VI). Rebreathing volumes less than 40% of the predicted FEV or VRD/VI of 0.4 or greater identified all subjects with a discrepancy between Qc(C2H2) and COID of 20% or greater.\r"

In decerebrate, paralyzed, vagotomized, and ventilated cats that had bilateral pneumothoraces, we recorded efferent activity from a phrenic nerve and from an abdominal nerve (cranial iliohypogastric nerve, L1). All cats showed phasic expiratory abdominal nerve discharge at normocapnia [end-tidal PCO2 38 +/- 2 Torr], but small doses (2-6 mg/kg) of pentobarbital sodium markedly depressed this activity. Hyperoxic hypercapnia consistently enhanced abdominal expiratory activity and shortened the burst duration. Isocapnic hypoxia caused inhibition of abdominal nerve discharge in 11 of 13 cats. Carotid sinus nerve denervation (3 cats) exacerbated the hypoxic depression of abdominal nerve activity and depressed phrenic motor output. Stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors with NaCN increased abdominal nerve discharge in 7 of 10 cats, although 2 cats exhibited marked inhibition. Four cats with intact neuraxis, but anesthetized with ketamine, yielded qualitatively similar results. We conclude that when cats are subjected to steady-state chemical stimuli in isolation (no interference from proprioceptive inputs), hypercapnia potentiates, but hypoxia attenuates, abdominal expiratory nerve activity. Mechanisms to explain the selective inhibition of expiratory motor activity by hypoxia are proposed, and physiological implications are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87307799\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of bronchoconstriction on respiratory changes in length of the costal diaphragm and the parasternal intercostal muscles. Ten dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and tracheostomized. Respiratory changes in muscle length were measured using sonomicrometry, and electromyograms were recorded with bipolar fine-wire electrodes. Administration of histamine aerosols increased pulmonary resistance from 6.4 to 14.5 cmH2O X l-1 X s, caused reductions in inspiratory and expiratory times, and decreased tidal volume. The peak and rate of rise of respiratory muscle electromyogram (EMG) activity increased significantly after histamine administration. Despite these increases, bronchoconstriction reduced diaphragm inspiratory shortening in 9 of 10 dogs and reduced intercostal muscle inspiratory shortening in 7 of 10 animals. The decreases in respiratory muscle tidal shortening were less than the reductions in tidal volume. The mean velocity of diaphragm and intercostal muscle inspiratory shortening increased after histamine administration but to a smaller extent than the rate of rise of EMG activity. This resulted in significant reductions in the ratio of respiratory muscle velocity of shortening to the rate of rise of EMG activity after bronchoconstriction for both the costal diaphragm and the parasternal intercostal muscles. Bronchoconstriction changed muscle end-expiratory length in most animals, but for the group of animals this was statistically significant only for the diaphragm. These results suggest that impairments of diaphragm and parasternal intercostal inspiratory shortening occur after bronchoconstriction; the mechanisms involved include an increased load, a shortening of inspiratory time, and for the diaphragm possibly a reduction in resting length.\r"

The subjects were sedentary at all other times and consumed a eucaloric meat-free diet. Needle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were examined for intracellular damage and glycogen content. Immediately after exercise, muscle samples showed myofibrillar tearing and edema. At 10 days, there was myofibrillar necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and no evidence of myofibrillar regeneration. Glycogen utilization during the exercise bout was 33 mmol glycosyl units/kg muscle, consistent with the metabolic intensity of 44% of maximal O2 uptake; however, the significant glycogen use by type II fibers contrasted with concentric exercise performed at this intensity. At 10 days after exercise, muscle glycogen was still depleted, in both type I and II fibers. It is possible that the alterations in muscle ultrastructures were related to the lack of repletion of muscle glycogen. Damage produced by eccentric exercise was more persistent than previously reported, indicating that more than 10 days may be necessary for recovery of muscle ultrastructure and carbohydrate reserves.\r"

  ".W": "Old rats have a decreased hindlimb muscle respiratory capacity and whole-body maximal O2 consumption (VO2 max). The decline in spontaneous physical activity in old rats might contribute to these age-related changes. The magnitude of the age-related decline is not uniform in all skeletal muscle respiratory enzymes, and the decrease in palmitate oxidation is particularly great. This study was designed to determine if young and old rats subjected to the same exercise-training protocol would attain similar values for VO2 max and several markers of muscle respiratory capacity. Four- and 18-mo-old Fischer 344 rats underwent an identical 6-mo program of treadmill running. After training, both age groups had increased VO2 max above sedentary age-matched controls. However, the old trained rats had a lower VO2 max than identically trained young rats. In contrast to VO2 max, the two trained groups attained similar values for gastrocnemius citrate synthase, cytochrome oxidase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, palmitate oxidation, and total carnitine concentration. Thus, when the young and old rats performed an identical exercise protocol within the capacity of the old animals, differences in skeletal muscle respiratory capacity were eliminated. The dissimilarity in VO2 max between the identically trained groups was apparently caused by age-related differences in factors other than muscle respiratory capacity.\r"

We sought to determine the hemodynamic mechanism underlying this reduction in blood pressure. Twenty-four men and women 60-69 yr of age with persistent essential hypertension completed one of the following protocols: exercise at 50% of maximum O2 consumption (VO2 max) followed by 1 h of recovery, exercise at 70% of VO2 max followed by 3 h of recovery, or a 4-h control study. Systolic pressure was significantly lower during recovery after both intensities of exercise, but diastolic pressure was unchanged. The lower blood pressure was primarily due to a reduction in cardiac output, since total peripheral resistance was increased throughout both recovery periods. Cardiac output was reduced in recovery because of a reduction in stroke volume. Heart rate was above, or no different from, that at rest before exercise. Changes in plasma volume could not entirely account for the reduction in stroke volume. Therefore, other mechanisms altering venous return and/or myocardial contractility appear to be responsible for the reduction in systolic blood pressure evident after a single bout of submaximal exercise in individuals with essential hypertension.\r"

Sinusoidal volume changes were delivered through a tracheostomy at frequencies from 0.5 to 30 Hz and measured by body plethysmography. Displacements of the RC and ABD were measured by inductive plethysmography. During oscillation at fixed tidal volume (VT = 1.3 ml/kg) the ratio ABD/RC, normalized to unity at 0.5 Hz, was 0.88 +/- 0.06 at 2 Hz and increased to 1.28 +/- 0.13 at 6 Hz (P less than 0.01). As frequency increased further ABD/RC fell sharply but between 20 and 30 Hz reached a plateau of 0.17 +/- 0.02 (P less than 0.001). Displacements of RC and ABD were nearly synchronous from 0.5 to 2 Hz, but as frequency increased ABD lagged RC progressively, reaching a phase difference of 90 degrees between 6 and 8 Hz and 180 degrees between 16 and 20 Hz. In six additional rabbits we measured chest wall displacements while varying VT from 0.5 to 3.7 ml/kg. ABD/RC was independent of VT at low frequencies (less than or equal to 6 Hz) but fell sharply with increasing VT at the higher frequencies. We interpreted these findings using a chest wall model having an RC compartment whose displacements are governed primarily by a nonlinear compliance, in parallel with an ABD compartment whose displacements are governed by a series resistance, inertance, and in addition a nonlinear compliance. The experimental findings are in large measure accounted for by such a model if the degree of nonlinearity of ABD and RC compliances are comparable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To explore how a chronic running program affects the function of hypertensive hearts, renal hypertension was created in female rats, and the animals were subjected to a program of chronic treadmill running. Running alone caused enhanced cardiac function, an increase in myosin adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity, and an increase in the percent of the V1 myosin isoenzyme. Hypertension alone caused cardiac hypertrophy with a depression in myosin ATPase activity and a decrease in the percent of the V1 isoenzyme. Running improved cardiac function in hearts of normotensive rats but had no effect in hearts of hypertensive rats. Despite the diminished myosin ATPase activity in hearts of hypertensive runners and the decrease in percent of the V1 isoenzyme, cardiac function was well maintained. The results demonstrate that a chronic running program in hypertensive rats, in contrast to a chronic swimming program, had virtually no effect on cardiac performance or contractile proteins. The dissociation between myocardial performance and the contractile proteins implicates other biochemical mechanisms in the adaptations observed.\r"

Female rats were divided into four groups: a vehicle (1% carboxymethycellulose)-treated group, a testosterone acetate (Te)-treated group, a cortisol acetate (Co)-treated group, and a Te + Co group. Animals were injected with the steroids (Te, 40 mg/kg body wt; Co, 20 mg/kg body wt) subcutaneously for 12 consecutive days. Absolute gastrocnemius muscle weights were 8% heavier after testosterone treatment, (P less than 0.05), 20% lighter after glucocorticoid treatment, and 18% lighter after both treatments than those of vehicle-treated animals. However, total body weight loss was less in the Te + Co group than in the group receiving just Co. Specific binding of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide, a synthetic glucocorticoid, in femtomoles per milligram gastrocnemius cytosol protein, was similar between the vehicle-treated (52.9 +/- 4.7) and Te-treated (48.9 +/- 3.6) groups. Specific cytosol binding was also depleted to the same extent (to 11-12 fmol/mg protein) by either the Co or Te + Co injections. There was minimal competition by testosterone for glucocorticoid binding; however, most of the displacement was observed in the corticosteroid binder IB form of the activated triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complex on DEAE-cellulose chromatography. We conclude that Te was ineffective in preventing muscle atrophy caused by Co treatment despite its ability to induce muscle growth. The binding specificity studies lead to the conclusion that most of the testosterone and cortisol functioning were occurring primarily through separate receptor systems.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether female Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) hypertensive rats would adapt to chronic treadmill exercise by exhibiting lower resting systolic blood pressures (RSBP), a 12-wk training program was undertaken. Female Dahl salt-resistant (SR) rats were also trained for the same time period a a similar intensity [40-70% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max)] and duration (55 min). Postexperimental treadmill run times and VO2max values [SR: nontrained (NT) 87 +/- 1, trained (T) 97 +/- 2; SS: NT 82 +/- 2, T 92 +/- 3 ml.min-1 X min-1 X kg-1] indicated that the prescribed program had produced a trained state. However, the training program caused no group differences between the SR or the SS and their nontrained controls in measurements associated with sodium chloride intake, fluid consumption, urine production, 24-h sodium excretion, plasma volumes, plasma insulin, or blood volumes. Chronic exercise did significantly lower RSBP in the SR subgroup after 6 wk (NT 123 +/- 4, T 110 +/- 3 mmHg) and 8 wk (NT 120 +/- 4, T 106 +/- 2 mmHg) and remained lower throughout the remaining weeks of the experiment. On the other hand, the RSBP results of the trained SS rats were significantly higher than the nontrained SS rats after 6 wk (NT 155 +/- 8, T 191 +/- 7 mmHg) and were never significantly different than the controls for the remainder of the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Survival after 13.5 days of exposure increased from 40 +/- 7% of pups that received buffered saline only to 95 +/- 4% of pups that received liposomes containing superoxide dismutase and catalase. Daily injection of control liposomes containing no enzymes also caused a less dramatic, though significant, increase in survival from 40 +/- 7 to 71 +/- 7% of O2-exposed pups, indicating that the lipid vehicle, as well as the liposome-entrapped antioxidant enzymes, contributed to the protective effect. The component of the protective effect that could be attributed to the antioxidant enzymes was lost if inactive catalase was used in liposome preparation.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperoxia and hyperbaric hyperoxia increased the rate of cerebral hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in unanesthetized rats in vivo, as measured by the H2O2-mediated inactivation of endogenous catalase activity following injection of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Brain catalase activity in rats breathing air (0.2 ATA O2) decreased to 75, 61, and 40% of controls due to endogenous H2O2 production at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively, after intraperitoneal injection of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The rate of catalase inactivation increased linearly in rats exposed to 0.6 ATA O2 (3 ATA air), 1.0 ATA O2 (normobaric 100% O2) and 3.0 ATA O2 (3 ATA 100% O2) compared with 0.2 ATA O2 (room air). Catalase inactivation was prevented by pretreatment of rats with ethanol (4 g/kg), a competitive substrate for the reactive catalase-H2O2 intermediate, compound I. This confirmed that catalase inactivation by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was due to formation of the catalase-H2O2 intermediate, compound I. The linear rate of catalase inactivation allows estimates of the average steady-state H2O2 concentration within brain peroxisomes to be calculated from the formula: [H2O2] = 6.6 pM + 5.6 ATA-1 X pM X [O2], where [O2] is the concentration of oxygen in ATA that the rats are breathing. Thus the H2O2 concentration in brains of rats exposed to room air is calculated to be about 7.7 pM, rises 60% when O2 tension is increased to 100% O2, and increases 300% at 3 ATA 100% O2, where symptoms of central nervous system toxicity first become apparent. These studies support the concept that H2O2 is an important mediator of O2-induced injury to the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Oxidant injury to the alveolar epithelium can be mediated by exposure to oxidant gases such as O2 at high concentrations and O3, inflammatory cell-derived reactive O2 species, and the intracellular metabolism of xenobiotics such as paraquat. An in vitro model of alveolar epithelial oxidant injury was developed based on exposure of cultured rat type II pneumocytes to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) enzymatically generated in the culture medium. Cytotoxicity was assessed by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium, which was a more reliable indicator of damage than release of 51Cr by prelabeled cells. Incubation of cells for 6-8 h with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase and glucose plus glucose oxidase induced the release of greater than 50% of total intracellular LDH. Oxidant exposure also resulted in significant detachment of cells from culture dishes. Modulation of oxidant damage was accomplished using liposomes as vectors for the delivery of catalase. Treatment of cells with catalase liposomes for 2 h resulted in augmentation of cellular catalase specific activities up to 631% of controls. Catalase was partitioned into intracellular and surface-associated compartments in catalase liposome-treated cells. Partial and complete protection against oxidant injury, induced by xanthine plus xanthine oxidase and glucose plus glucose oxidase, respectively, was achieved by pretreatment of cells with catalase liposomes. LDH release during oxidant exposure was inversely related to augmentation of cellular catalase activities. Catalase liposome-treated cells also exhibited an enhanced ability to scavenge enzymatically generated H2O2 from the culture medium. These observations suggest a useful approach to modulation of alveolar injury induced by reactive O2 species.\r"

From the total respiratory (Zrs) and pulmonary impedance (ZL), measured with pseudorandom oscillations applied at the airway opening before and after thoracotomy, respectively, the chest wall impedance (ZW) was calculated as ZW = Zrs - ZL. The pulmonary (RL) and chest wall resistances were both markedly frequency dependent: between 0.25 and 2 Hz they contributed equally to the total resistance falling from 81.4 +/- 18.3 (SD) at 0.25 Hz to 27.1 +/- 1.7 kPa.l-1 X s at 2 Hz. The pulmonary compliance (CL) decreased mildly, from 2.78 +/- 0.44 at 0.25 Hz to 2.36 +/- 0.39 ml/kPa at 2 Hz, and then increased at higher frequencies, whereas the chest wall compliance declined monotonously from 4.19 +/- 0.88 at 0.25 Hz to 1.93 +/- 0.14 ml/kPa at 10 Hz. Although the frequency dependence of ZW can be interpreted on the basis of parallel inhomogeneities alone, the sharp fall in RL together with the relatively constant CL suggests that at low frequencies significant losses are imposed by the non-Newtonian resistive properties of the lung tissue.\r"

In this study, the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the alae nasi (AN), genioglossus (GG), and chest wall (CW) or diaphragm (Di) to ventilatory loading were assessed in six laryngectomized, tracheostomized human subjects and in six subjects breathing with an intact UA before and after topical UA anesthesia. The EMG activities of the UA and thoracic muscles increased at similar rates with increasing hypercapnia in normal subjects, in subjects whose upper airways were anesthetized, and in laryngectomized subjects breathing with a cervical tracheostomy. Furthermore, in the laryngectomized subjects, respiratory muscle EMG activation increased with resistive inspiratory loading (15 cmH2O X l-1 X s) applied at the level of a cervical tracheostomy. At an average expired CO2 fraction of 7.0%, resistive loading resulted in a 93 +/- 26.3% (SE) increase in peak AN EMG activity, a 39 +/- 2.0% increase in peak GG EMG activity, and a 43.2 +/- 16.5% increase in peak CW (Di) EMG activity compared with control values. We conclude that the ventilatory responses of the UA and thoracic muscles to ventilatory loading are not substantially influenced by laryngectomy or UA anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The occurrence of upper airway obstruction during sleep and with anesthesia suggests the possibility that upper airway size might be compromised by the gravitational effects of the supine position. We used an acoustic reflection technique to image airway geometry and made 180 estimates of effective cross-sectional area as a function of distance along the airway in 10 healthy volunteers while they were supine and also while they were seated upright. We calculated z-scores along the airway and found that pharyngeal cross-sectional area was smaller in the supine than in the upright position in 9 of the 10 subjects. For all subjects, pharyngeal cross-sectional area was 23 +/- 8% smaller in the supine than in the upright position (P less than or equal to 0.05), whereas glottic and tracheal areas were not significantly altered. Because changing from the upright to the supine position causes a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC), six of these subjects were placed in an Emerson cuirass, which was evacuated producing a positive transrespiratory pressure so as to restore end-expiratory lung volume to that seen before the position change. In the supine posture an increase in end-expiratory lung volume did not change the cross-sectional area at any point along the airway. We conclude that pharyngeal cross-sectional area decreases as a result of a change from the upright to the supine position and that the mechanism of this change is independent of the change in FRC.\r"

O2 uptake was stimulated by 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Arterial, mixed venous, and muscle venous blood samples were drawn before, during, and after severe hypoxia (9% O2-91% N2) for the calculation of hindlimb O2 uptake and cardiac output. The O2 deficit and excess O2 uptake in recovery were calculated as the cumulative differences between normoxic control and respective hypoxic and recovery O2 uptake values. The DNP data were compared with data previously obtained in our laboratory. A greater whole-body O2 deficit was incurred in the DNP group during hypoxia and was associated with a larger O2 use in recovery. The total O2 deficit was equally distributed between muscle and nonmuscle tissues, but more excess O2 use occurred in nonmuscle tissues. The greater excess O2 used by nonmuscle tissues may have been associated with the restoration of intracellular ion concentrations brought about by the increased activity of energy-using membrane pumps.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral blood flow increases at high altitude, but the mechanism of the increase and its role in adaptation to high altitude are unclear. We hypothesized that the hypoxemia at high altitude would increase cerebral blood flow, which would in turn defend O2 delivery to the brain. Noninvasive Doppler ultrasound was used to measure the flow velocities in the internal carotid and the vertebral arteries in six healthy male subjects. Within 2-4 h of arrival on Pikes Peak (4,300 m), velocities in both arteries were slightly and not significantly increased above sea-level values. By 18-44 h a peak increase of 20% was observed (combined P less than 0.025). Subsequently (days 4-12) velocities declined to values similar to those at sea level. At altitude the lowest arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) and the highest end-tidal PCO2 was observed on arrival. By day 4 and thereafter, when the flow velocities had returned toward sea-level values, hemoglobin concentration and SaO2 were increased over initial high-altitude values such that calculated O2 transport values were even higher than those at sea level. Although the cause of the failure for cerebral flow velocity to increase on arrival is not understood, the subsequent increase may act to defend brain O2 transport. With further increase in hemoglobin and SaO2 over time at high altitude, flow velocity returned to sea-level values.\r"

Blood samples were collected as soon as possible (average of 43 s), at 2 and 7 min postexercise. Plasma epinephrine decreased from 0.79 +/- 0.09 ng/ml to 0.51 +/- 0.05 after 2 min and to 0.35 +/- 0.09 after 7 min. Plasma norepinephrine decreased from 0.89 +/- 0.16 ng/ml to 0.61 +/- 0.05 after 2 min and to 0.50 +/- 0.07 after 7 min. We also studied the effect of time of centrifugation with respect to time of blood collection on plasma catecholamines. If blood samples were kept on ice no significant change in plasma epinephrine occurred over a period of 1 h. A small (14%) but significant decrease in norepinephrine was observed after 15 and 60 min. These studies emphasize the importance of collecting rat blood samples as quickly as possible after the end of exercise. Catecholamines decline very quickly in the rat after intravenous pentobarbital anesthesia.\r"

Eight subjects in the first series and 13 subjects in the second series were analyzed up to the depths of 400-450 m of seawater (msw). The data indicated that injections of N2 in He-O2 mixture reduced or suppressed the hyperbaric tremor in the two series. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes were recorded with the two types of compression, but these changes (increase in slow waves, decrease in alpha-activity, appearance of microsleep EEG traces) were more important with the fast exponential compression curves between 200 and 300 msw than with the slow exponential curves. The effects of the fast rates of compression on EEG activities were not compensated by addition of 4-5% N2. Consequently, the fast exponential compression curves, even with N2 injections, cannot be used without risk and must be avoided; the slow exponential compression curve with N2 injection allowed a human subject to reach 450 msw in satisfactory condition, i.e., without tremor and with light EEG changes.\r"

Muscle extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) was determined using [3H]mannitol, [14C]mannitol, [3H]polyethylene glycol (PEG, mol wt 900, PEG-900) or the chloride (Cl) method and intracellular fluid volume (ICFV) calculated. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. The muscles were biopsied, frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried, weighed, and transferred to vials for analysis. For a given muscle, ion contents measured by the two methods showed a consistent small difference which could not be explained. The PEG-900 space and the Cl method yielded a larger ECFV than did mannitol; it is concluded that PEG-900 and Cl overestimate ECFV. There were significant differences in total tissue water (TTW), ECFV, ICFV, and intracellular ion contents between the different muscle types. The fast glycolytic muscles (white gastrocnemius, plantaris) had lower TTW (758 ml/kg wet wt) and ECFV (6.5-8.5% TTW) but the highest ICFV; the soleus (slow oxidative fibers) had the highest TTW (766 ml/kg wet wt) and ECFV (10-15% TTW) but the lowest ICFV. The fast-twitch white gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles have a higher intracellular content of K+ and lower Na+ and Cl- than the slow-twitch soleus muscle. The technique of INAA provides a rapid and accurate means of determining intramuscular ion content in small samples of tissue.\r"

PEFV curves were generated from end inspiration by rapid compression of the chest wall with an inflatable jacket. VmaxFRC, expressed in milliliter per second, correlated linearly with height, weight, age, and FRC in milliliter and milliliters per kilogram. The best correlation of VmaxFRC (ml/s) was to height to the power of 2.47, which agrees with the results predicted by wave-speed theory. Mean FRC-corrected VmaxFRC was 2.42 +/- 0.50 (SD) FRC's/s with no significant difference between boys (2.35 FRC's/s) and girls (2.51 FRC's/s). There was no correlation between lung-size corrected VmaxFRC and height, weight, or age, but it tended to decrease with increasing FRC. The intersubject variability for VmaxFRC was reduced by normalizing for FRC, and was significantly better than that reported for awake children. This can be attributed to the greater control over volume history and more reliable maximal flow generation during anesthesia. The intrasubject coefficient of variation (CV) for VmaxFRC was 12.2%, and the intersubject CV was 20.0%. The difference may represent the variability due to dysanapsis. It is concluded that dysanapsis is not a prominent factor in children of this age group. In addition, the similarity of the regression equation for VmaxFRC vs. height to that of FRC vs. height supports the concept of equidimensional growth of the airways and lung parenchyma.\r"

Approximately 77% was free carnitine and 19% acetylcarnitine. Four minutes of stimulation or intense exercise did not effect total carnitine but did result in a marked fall in free carnitine and almost equivalent rise in acetylcarnitine. The results indicate that acetylcarnitine is a major metabolite formed during intense muscular effort and that carnitine may function in the regulation of the acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio by buffering excess production of acetyl units.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental data suggest that theophylline (T) enhances diaphragmatic contractility by increasing the influx of calcium at the cell membrane level through an inhibition of adenosine receptors (Aubier et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 54: 460-4, 1983). Enprofylline (E) is a xanthine drug that has poor ability to antagonize physiological actions of adenosine. The aim of this study was to compare the effects on diaphragmatic contractility of T and E in order to determine whether antagonism of adenosine receptors was the underlying mechanism of the inotropic effect of T on diaphragmatic contractility. Ten normal subjects were studied in the sitting position. The contractile properties of the diaphragm were assessed by measuring the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated at functional residual capacity during bilateral electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves. The subjects were randomized, and after control measurements were performed, they received T or E. This was a double-blind crossover study, the measurements being repeated with the second drug after one week. Both drugs were administered intravenously with a loading dose of 6 and 2 mg/kg administered in 30 min for T and E and a maintenance dose of 0.9 and 0.075 mg.kg-1 X h-1 for T and E, respectively. Measurements were performed before and 60 min after T or E administration. Plasmatic levels of both drugs were also analyzed. In all the subjects, therapeutic levels of T or E were reached (14.8 +/- 0.6 and 3.9 +/- 0.42 mg/l for T and E, respectively, at 30 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) occurs mainly in alveolar or extra-alveolar vessels in ferrets, we used two groups of isolated lungs perfused with autologous blood and a constant left atrial pressure (-5 Torr). In the first group, flow (Q) was held constant at 50, 100, and 150 ml.kg-1 X min-1, and changes in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) were recorded as alveolar pressure (Palv) was lowered from 25 to 0 Torr during control [inspired partial pressure of O2 (PIO2) = 200 Torr] and hypoxic (PIO2 = 25 Torr) conditions. From these data, pressure-flow relationships were constructed at several levels of Palv. In the control state, lung inflation did not affect the slope of the pressure-flow relationships (delta Ppa/delta Q), but caused the extrapolated pressure-axis intercept (Ppa0), representing the mean backpressure to flow, to increase when Palv was greater than or equal to 5 Torr. Hypoxia increased delta Ppa/delta Q and Ppa0 at all levels of Palv. In contrast to its effects under control condition, lung inflation during hypoxia caused a progressive decrease in delta Ppa/delta Q, and did not alter Ppa0 until Palv was greater than or equal to 10 Torr. In the second group of experiments flow was maintained at 100 ml.kg-1 X min-1, and changes in lung blood volume (LBV) were recorded as Palv was varied between 20 and 0 Torr. In the control state, inflation increased LBV over the entire range of Palv. In the hypoxic state inflation decreased LBV until Palv reached 8 Torr; at Palv 8-20 Torr, inflation increased LBV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine the significance of endogenous stores of glycogen in specific fiber types (I, IIa, IIb) of the costal region of the diaphragm, adult male Wistar rats performed continuous running (25 m/min, 8 degrees grade) exercise for either 30 min or until fatigue. At 30 min of exercise, glycogen loss, as measured microphotometrically using the periodic acid-Schiff technique averaged between 73 and 80% (P less than 0.05) in the different fiber types. When exercise was performed to exhaustion, representing an additional 94 min, no further reduction in glycogen was observed in any fiber type. Biochemical determinations of glycogen from the diaphragm confirmed the extensive reduction in glycogen concentration with exercise. Large reductions (P less than 0.05) in glycogen were also noted in the soleus, plantaris, and vastus lateralis red. Although significant depletion (P less than 0.05) occurred in the vastus lateralis white, it was not as pronounced as in these other muscles. Repletion to preexercise glycogen concentration was complete by 4 h of recovery in all muscles except the vastus lateralis white. It is concluded that endogenous glycogen is a significant substrate in all muscles sampled regardless of fiber composition. In the case of the costal region of the diaphragm, the increased work of breathing resulting from heavy exercise leads to the recruitment of all fiber types, and each fiber type depends on glycogen as a substrate at least early in the exercise.\r"

Airway responsiveness was determined by measuring changes to airway resistance to graded doses of aerosolized histamine, and mucosal permeability was determined by measuring the appearance of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-D) in the blood and examining its distribution in lung tissue after it had been delivered to the lung in an aerosol. The results confirm previous studies that smoke exposure increased airway responsiveness and mucosal permeability. They also show that urethan anesthesia administered before smoke exposure prevented the smoke-related changes in airway reactivity and mucosal permeability. In animals that remained conscious during the smoke exposure, there was increased deposition of the dextran in the regions of the bronchioloalveolar junctions with a more rapid uptake of FITC-D into the blood. We postulate that, when urethan anesthesia is administered before smoke exposure, the exudative phase of the inflammatory reaction produced by smoke exposure is suppressed.\r"

A third, sham-operated control group (n = 16) remained cage sedentary for 11 wk.

The diameter of septal fibers was 13% greater in the trained and 17% greater in the nontrained infarct groups compared with control. The specific peak developed force and maximum rate of force development of left ventricular papillary muscle in vitro were 75 and 62% greater in both infarcted groups compared with the control group; these variables were unaffected by training. Myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase activity of septum was 20% lower in both infarct groups compared with sham-operated animals. We conclude that exercise training did not alter the magnitude of morphological and physiological adaptations to infarction.\r"

The method relies on the formation of an immune complex of labeled antiamino-terminal PTH antibody, intact hPTH, and solid phase antimidregion PTH antibody. A chemiluminescent aryl acridinium ester is used as label. Serum samples (100 microL) are incubated with labeled antibody, and subsequently the bound fraction is separated by the addition of solid phase antibody. The bound luminescence is quantitated in an automatic luminometer. Luminescence intensity is directly proportional to the amount of intact PTH present in the sample. Only intact PTH was found to react in this system; there was no significant interference from PTH fragments. The assay detection limit of 0.8 pmol/L hPTH-(1-84) allowed detection of intact PTH in the serum of all normal subjects tested. A clear distinction was found between hypercalcemic individuals subsequently proven to have primary hyperparathyroidism and those with malignancies. The assay offers several advantages over previously described PTH immunoassays with regard to specificity, rapidity, and reagent stability. It, thus, provides a valuable means of investigating parathyroid physiology and clinical disorders of extracellular calcium metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "87308629\r", 
  ".W": "A binding protein for insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) has been purified from human amniotic fluid by IGF-I affinity chromatography and high performance reverse phase chromatography. This protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 28K nonreduced and 34K reduced, had an identical amino-terminus to a previously purified binding protein from amniotic fluid and to placental protein 12. The purified preparation (BP-28) bound both IGFs with high affinity [Ka, 6.55 +/- 2.24 (+/- SD) L/nmol for IGF-I and 3.23 +/- 1.05 L/nmol for IGF-II], with approximately 0.5 mol binding sites/mol BP-28 for either ligand. A 53K IGF-binding protein purified from human plasma (BP-53) did not cross-react in a RIA for BP-28, and BP-28 had less than 0.1% molar cross-reactivity in a RIA for BP-53. Human amniotic fluid reacted strongly in both assays. Fractionation of amniotic fluid samples by reverse phase chromatography showed that BP-28 and BP-53 immunoreactivities were present on separate proteins. In 40 third trimester amniotic fluid samples selected to cover a wide range of lecithin to sphingomyelin ratios, the mean concentrations of BP-28 and BP-53 were 37.6 +/- 17.6 (+/- SD) and 4.6 +/- 1.6 mg/L, respectively. Significant negative correlations were found between the levels of both BP-28 and BP-53 and the lecithin to sphingomyelin ratio, suggesting an association between the levels of both proteins and the degree of fetal maturity. A significant positive association was also found between the levels of BP-28 and BP-53. We conclude that the 28K IGF-binding protein from amniotic fluid, like the previously purified 53K binding protein, has high affinity for both IGF-I and IGF-II, that it coexists in amniotic fluid with BP-53 or a related protein, and that the levels of both proteins decline with increasing fetal maturity.\r"

Compared to values in normal subjects of corresponding age, DHEA-S levels were decreased in 80 patients. The decrease was unrelated to the cause of the secondary adrenal insufficiency or the serum PRL level. Serum cortisol concentrations, on the other hand, were low in 71 patients and low normal in the remaining 13. Serum DHEA-S levels were decreased in 11 of these 13 patients. The frequency of decreased serum DHEA-S levels in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency was significantly higher than that of decreased cortisol levels. These results suggest that decreased serum DHEA-S levels reflect deficient ACTH secretion in secondary adrenal insufficiency and that simultaneous determination of serum DHEA-S and cortisol levels is useful in the diagnosis of this pathological state.\r"

Accordingly, echocardiographic determination of cardiac chamber volume and neurohormonal responses were studied in 14 normal subjects during incremental LBNP. LBNP -10 mm Hg decreased left atrial diameter and left ventricular systolic volume index, but did not alter heart rate, systolic or pulse pressure, or stroke volume. During LBNP -10 mm Hg, plasma norepinephrine levels increased, suggesting activation of the sympathetic nervous system. LBNP -40 mm Hg caused a significant decrease in left atrial diameter and left ventricular systolic, diastolic, and stroke volume indices. During LBNP -40 mm Hg, heart rate increased, and systolic and pulse pressure fell. With this more negative level of LBNP, norepinephrine, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and arginine vasopressin concentrations and PRA all increased. The findings that left atrial diameter decreased and plasma norepinephrine concentration increased during LBNP -10 mm Hg suggest that the sympathetic nervous system is sensitive to changes in atrial receptor activity. At higher levels of LBNP (-40 mm Hg), activation of the renin-angiotensin system and release of vasopressin were associated with a fall in left ventricular diastolic volume as well as a decrease in the pressure input to the arterial baroreceptors. Under this condition, the differential contribution of the cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreceptors to the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin release cannot be distinguished.\r"

To determine the frequency of aberrations in peripheral steroid levels in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) we measured morning recumbent plasma cortisol, deoxycorticosterone, 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone (18-OHDOC), corticosterone, aldosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone concentrations before and after administration of 0.25 mg ACTH (Cosyntropin) in 74 randomly selected hospitalized patients with AIDS and 19 patients with ARC. Basal (0800 h) cortisol levels in the AIDS patients were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those in normal subjects, while other ACTH-dependent steroids of the 17-deoxypathway, deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and 18-OHDOC, were normal. These latter steroids increased subnormally in response to ACTH in patients with either AIDS (P less than 0.001) or ARC (P less than 0.005), but in ARC patients plasma 18-OHDOC levels were significantly higher than in those with AIDS (P less than 0.001). Supraphysiological doses of ACTH were then administered for 3 consecutive days to 14 patients with AIDS and 9 with ARC, which confirmed and amplified the subnormal responses of these steroids in AIDS. The mean plasma cortisol response was reduced on the third day only in AIDS patients, whereas in the ARC patients the steroid responses were normal. Angiotensin III infusion and postural stimulation increased plasma aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone levels in AIDS and ARC patients. Defective stimulation of 18-OHDOC alone or in combination with defective stimulation of other 17-deoxysteroids can be a harbinger of subsequent impaired adrenal capacity in AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Renal metabolism of C-peptide was studied in nine nondiabetic nonobese patients with normal renal function by the arterial-venous difference technique before and after the oral administration of an amino acid mixture simulating an animal protein meal. In the basal state, the kidney removed 25.7 +/- 7.5% (+/- SD) of the arterial plasma C-peptide. Renal uptake was approximately 7-fold greater than urinary excretion, and thus, more than 85% of the amount extracted was metabolized by the kidney. Renal C-peptide clearance was very high and approximated the glomerular filtration rate, whereas urinary C-peptide clearance was only 14% of its renal clearance. Shortly after amino acid ingestion, arterial C-peptide levels increased by 107%, and C-peptide renal fractional extraction, uptake, and net metabolism also increased markedly (67%, 278%, and 328%, respectively); urinary clearance and excretion did not change. Renal clearance became 2-fold greater than the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that in this phase the kidney removed substantial amounts of C-peptide from peritubular blood as well as by filtration. Both renal uptake and urinary excretion of C-peptide were related to its arterial levels (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05, respectively), but renal uptake increased much more than urinary excretion for each increment in arterial C-peptide levels. These results indicate that renal C-peptide metabolism is considerable in the postabsorptive state and is even more marked during the postprandial period. The kidney, therefore, plays a key role in both the regulation of circulating plasma levels and the metabolic clearance of C-peptide.\r"

  ".W": "There is an age-related increase in plasma norepinephrine (NE) in humans that is due to both an increase in NE appearance into plasma and a decrease in plasma NE clearance. However, previous studies demonstrated no difference in plasma epinephrine (EPI) in young and old subjects, and the effect of aging on plasma EPI appearance and clearance is unclear. To study age differences in basal NE and EPI metabolism we infused eight young (aged 19-26 yr) and eight old (aged 64-74 yr) normal subjects with [3H]NE or [3H]EPI (15 microCi/m2 bolus dose plus 0.35 microCi/m2/min for 50 min) to achieve steady state conditions on separate days. The old subjects had higher arterialized plasma NE levels [mean, 217 +/- 13 (+/- SE) vs. 149 +/- 12 pg/mL; P less than 0.005] and plasma NE appearance. In contrast, neither plasma EPI levels (98 +/- 8 vs. 104 +/- 10 pg/mL; P = NS) nor EPI appearance rates were different in the old and young subjects. The plasma clearance rates of EPI and NE were nearly identical in the young subjects (1.63 +/- 0.14 vs. 166 +/- 0.09 L/min X m2; P = NS). Plasma NE clearance was lower in the old compared to the young subjects (1.38 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.64 +/- 0.10 L/min X m2; P less than 0.05) and was lower than EPI plasma clearance in the same subjects. Although NE and EPI can be removed by both neuronal and nonneuronal uptake mechanisms, and mean plasma clearance values for NE and EPI are the same in the young, the age-related decline in catecholamine clearance is specific for NE. This finding implies a differential effect of age on a catecholamine removal mechanism that is specific for NE.\r"

Plasma PRL was determined in blood samples collected before and at frequent intervals for 5 days after CBG administration. Both CBG doses induced marked inhibition of PRL secretion in all women. A decrease in plasma PRL levels was evident 1-2 h after CBG administration and persisted for up to 5 days. The 600-micrograms CBG dose had a more potent (P less than 0.05) PRL inhibitory effect than the 400-micrograms dose in normal, puerperal, and hyperprolactinemic women. Moreover, while 400 micrograms CBG prevented lactation in 3 of 7 puerperal women, 600 micrograms CBG prevented lactation in 5 of 5 puerperal women. A moderate blood pressure decrease occurred 3-6 h after CBG treatment, but no other side-effects occurred. These results demonstrate that CBG induces a dose-related inhibition of PRL secretion in normal women as well as in puerperal and hyperprolactinemic women. The potent long-lasting PRL inhibitory effect of CBG in conjunction with the absence of side-effects typical of dopaminergic compounds suggest that this drug is an advance in the medical treatment of hyperprolactinemia.\r"

  ".W": "The act of drinking ameliorates thirst and inhibits the secretion of vasopressin before changes in extracellular fluid volume or osmolality in both animals and man. We evaluated whether this reflex inhibition of vasopressin secretion might be due to the presence of oropharyngeal receptors in humans. After dehydration, normal subjects (n = 4) were allowed to suck on ice chips for 30 min. Despite the absence of changes in plasma sodium (Na+) or osmolality, the mean plasma vasopressin level decreased promptly within 10 min from 2.8 to 1.8 pg/mL, and it remained low for 30 min after ice ingestion. When the dehydration protocol was repeated with the subjects receiving 100 mL water (25 C) for 30 min rather than ice chips, plasma vasopressin levels did not change. These data demonstrate that activation of cold-sensitive oropharyngeal receptors results in inhibition of vasopressin secretion independently of osmotic or gastric factors. In a second study 0.2 mL/kg X min 3% NaCl was administered for 90 min as a second stimulus to vasopressin secretion, and ice chips were given during the last 30 min of infusion. Plasma vasopressin levels increased steadily to 3.3 +/- 0.5 (+/- SEM) pg/mL by 45 min, and despite ice ingestion increased further to 4.6 +/- 0.8 pg/mL by 90 min. Consequently, hypertonicity appears to be a stronger stimulus to vasopressin release, since the suppressive effect of stimulation of oropharyngeal receptors with ice was not evident during the NaCl infusion. Finally, no changes in vasopressin levels were found in subjects holding concentrated NaCl solutions in their mouths for 30 min, indicating that the oropharyngeal receptors are not responsive to local changes in osmolality. The presence of such cold-sensitive oropharyngeal receptors may explain the desire of severely dehydrated patients, e.g. patients with diabetes insipidus, for cold liquids.\r"

Hybridization experiments were performed on cells immediately after dispersal or on cells cultured for 48-72 h in a defined serum-free medium. Tritiated GH cDNA was used to probe fixed cells, and hybridization was determined by liquid autoradiography. Of the freshly dispersed adenoma cells probed with GH cDNA, more than 70% contained GH mRNA, as determined by counting silver grains per cell. Significant cellular grain counts were obtained for GH cDNA-probed cells from all five tumors, while negative controls showed negligible silver grain counts. In cultured cells derived from three of five tumors, an average of 40% contained detectable GH mRNA. Therefore, quantitative in situ hybridization is a useful technique to demonstrate the expression of GH mRNA in human pituitary adenoma cells.\r"

Sixteen months after institution of aggressive phlebotomy therapy, serum LH, FSH, and testosterone were normal, and potency and libido had returned. Twenty months after diagnosis the patient fathered another child. Seminal fluid analysis at that time revealed an average of 65 million spermatozoa/mL. Thus, recovery of reproductive function, documented by hormone measurements, testicular biopsy, and semen analysis, was complete. We conclude that phlebotomy alone may be adequate treatment for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men with hemochromatosis.\r"

We investigated the mechanism of action of lipid X and 3-aza-lipid X, a diamino-analogue, in vitro, using the ability of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to prime neutrophils for an enhanced release of toxic oxygen radicals. Lipid X and 3-aza-lipid X inhibited LPS-induced neutrophil priming in a concentration-dependent manner. At high concentrations, 3-aza-lipid X was a partial agonist of priming. Lipid X was found to inhibit LPS-induced priming by directly interacting with the neutrophil in contrast to polymyxin B, which neutralized LPS by binding to it. Increasing concentrations of lipid X shifted the LPS dose response curve of neutrophils rightward but did not prevent maximum priming at higher LPS concentrations, a finding consistent with competitive inhibition. These results suggest that lipid X, a compound structurally related to lipid A, may block neutrophil priming by competing with LPS for cellular binding sites. Lipid X appears to have a novel mechanism of inhibiting LPS effect and may have efficacy in the treatment of gram-negative sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "Because catecholamines and digitalis have different effects on the time course of myocardial intracellular calcium concentration, their effects on the time course of left ventricular contraction and relaxation may also be different. To study this question, dogs were instrumented to measure left ventricular pressure and determine left ventricular volume from three ultrasonic dimensions. After full recovery from the instrumentation, the effects of dobutamine (2-10 micrograms/kg), ouabain (0.5 mg i.v.) alone, and ouabain given after propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.), or phentolamine (5 mg i.v.) and incremental doses of ouabain (0.25-0.75 mg i.v.) were assessed on different days. Left ventricular pressure and volume were varied by caval occlusions. Dobutamine significantly increased the slope of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation (Emax) and the slope of the dP/dtmax-end-diastolic volume relation (dE/dtmax), while significantly decreasing the time from end-diastole to end-systole (tmax) and the time constant (T) of the isovolumic fall in left ventricular pressure. Ouabain also increased Emax and dE/dtmax but did not alter tmax or T. Dobutamine produced a greater increase in dE/dtmax than in Emax, whereas ouabain produced similar increases in both. These effects of ouabain were not altered by pretreatment with propranolol or phentolamine. We conclude that although dobutamine and ouabain are both positive inotropes that increase Emax, dobutamine speeds the rate of left ventricular contraction (tmax) and relaxation (T), whereas ouabain does not. These effects of ouabain and dobutamine on global parameters of left ventricular chamber performance mirror their influence on intracellular calcium availability. Furthermore, these observations are consistent with the predictions of the time-varying elastance model of the left ventricle and support its usefulness as a conceptual framework to understand and link events occurring during isovolumic contraction, end-systole, and isovolumic relaxation.\r"

No effect was detected on the fractional absorption of water, total CO2, and chloride at end-proximal and early distal sites of superficial nephrons in intact animals; dDAVP, however, inhibited the fractional absorption of total CO2 in Henle's loop while stimulating that of chloride in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) somatostatin-infused rats. In the distal tubule accessible to micropuncture, net total CO2 secretion was observed during hypotonic volume expansion, which reversed to net total CO2 absorption during dDAVP infusion in intact Wistar rats. Marked stimulation of urinary acidification occurred in all animals as attested by a fall in urine pH and bicarbonate excretion. Net acid excretion almost doubled in intact rats. We conclude that (a) antidiuretic hormone (ADH) inhibits fractional bicarbonate absorption in the thick ascending limb while stimulating that of chloride at least in TPTX somatostatin-infused rats, and (b) ADH stimulates proton secretion (or inhibits bicarbonate secretion) in the distal tubule and cortical collecting ducts, which leads to enhanced urinary acidification.\r"

The effect on D-glucose uptake was present after only 15 min of ischemia and was due to a reduction in maximum velocity (1913 +/- 251 vs. 999 +/- 130 pmol/mg per 2 s; P less than 0.01). This reduction was not due to more rapid dissipation of the Na+ gradient, altered sidedness of the vesicles, or an alteration in membrane potential. Ischemia did, however, reduce the BBM sphingomyelin-to-phosphatidylcholine (SPH/PC) and cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratios and the number of specific high-affinity Na+-dependent phlorizin binding sites (390 +/- 43 vs. 146 +/- 24 pmol/mg; P less than 0.01) without altering the binding dissociation constant (Kd). 20 mM benzyl alcohol also reduced the number of Na+-dependent phlorizin binding sites (418 +/- 65 vs. 117 +/- 46; P less than 0.01) without altering Kd. The reduction in Na+-dependent D-glucose transport correlated with ischemic-induced changes in the BBM SPH/PC and cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratios and membrane fluidity. Taken together these data indicate the cellular site responsible for ischemic-induced reduction in renal cortical transcellular glucose transport is the BBM. We propose the mechanism involves marked alterations in BBM lipids leading to large increases in BBM fluidity which reduces the binding capacity of Na+-dependent glucose carriers. These data indicate that reversible ischemia has profound effects on the surface membrane function of epithelial cells.\r"

The competitor activity in mesangial cell conditioned medium (MCCM) is reversible, trypsin sensitive, and inhibited by anti-PDGF IgG. MCCM also expresses potent mitogenic activity to HFF. Anti-PDGF IgG, in concentrations that completely abolished the mitogenic activity of pure PDGF and the competitor activity of MCCM, only partially (33-41%) inhibits this mitogenic activity. The PDGF receptor competing activity as well as the total mitogenic activity, coelutes with labeled pure PDGF on Sephacryl S-200 gel chromatography. Cation exchange chromatography of concentrated MCCM yields a major mitogen peak with little competitor activity and a smaller mitogenic peak with comparable competitor activity, suggestive of the presence of other mitogens in MCCM besides the PDGF-like protein. PDGF is a potent mitogen and may play a role at inflammatory sites. The production of PDGF-like protein by MC may provide insights for understanding the pathogenesis of glomerular diseases.\r"

In the present report, we show that the failure to find anti-Sm antibodies in three-quarters of 5-mo-old MRL/lpr mice was not an artifact of an insensitive assay, but rather that the mice fell into two populations as regards their anti-Sm positivity. Based on an extensive analysis of the incidence of anti-Sm positivity in 5-mo-old mice according to their cage of residence, we found no evidence for genetic, environmental, or parental influences on the propensity of an individual animal to become anti-Sm positive. Also, the gender of the mouse, its Sm antigen level, or its length of survival were not related to anti-Sm antibody, nor was the anti-Sm antibody status of either parent. Some animals became anti-Sm positive after 5 mo of age, but this was less likely than becoming positive before 5 mo of age. Finally, a survey of 205 autoimmune C57BL/6-lpr/lpr mice confirmed the uniqueness of the MRL background for this autoantibody response. These results together indicate that the possibility of making anti-Sm antibodies is under genetic control, but that the expression of this capability in an individual animal is governed by stochastic events. We hypothesize further that such random processes may involve the expression of particular immunoglobulin variable-region genes combined with mechanisms of extensive somatic mutation or positive feedback amplification, which would transmute an initial monoclonal response into an eventual polyclonal one.\r"

Bone mineral density was significantly more highly correlated in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins for the spine and proximal femur and in the forearm of premenopausal twin pairs, which is consistent with significant genetic contributions to bone mass at all these sites. The lesser genetic contribution to proximal femur and distal forearm bone mass compared with the spine suggests that environmental factors are of greater importance in the aetiology of osteopenia of the hip and wrist. This is the first demonstration of a genetic contribution to bone mass of the spine and proximal femur in adults and confirms similar findings of the forearm. Furthermore, bivariate analysis suggested that a single gene or set of genes determines bone mass at all sites.\r"

Folate binding was pH, time- and temperature-dependent, saturable, and was much greater for pteroylmonoglutamate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate than 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and amethopterin. On detergent solubilization of membranes, two peaks of specific folate binding with Mr greater than or equal to 200,000 and 160,000 were identified on Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography in Triton X-100, and this corresponded to two similar peaks of immunoprecipitated material when solubilized iodinated membranes were probed with anti-human placental folate receptor antiserum. Age-dependent separation of erythrocytes by Stractan density gradients revealed a sevenfold greater folate binding capacity in membranes purified from younger compared with aged erythrocytes. Since this difference was not reflected in proportionately higher immunoreactive folate binding protein, (as determined by a specific radioimmunoassay for these proteins), or differences in affinity in younger than aged cells, these findings indicate that erythrocyte folate binding proteins become progressively nonfunctional at the onset of red cell aging.\r"

Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to quantify conjugated and nonconjugated iodothyronines, and iodide was measured as the TCA-soluble radioactivity. In control rats, radioiodide was the main metabolite of both T3 and T3S. Plasma T3S was cleared more rapidly than plasma T3 despite increased binding to plasma proteins. PTU reduced plasma iodide levels by 66 and 78% after T3 and T3S, respectively, and decreased plasma clearance of T3S by 81%. However, PTU had no effect on plasma T3 clearance but increased plasma T3S from injected T3 4.2 times. Biliary excretion of injected T3S was less than 20% in normal rats, in contrast to 70% within 4 h in PTU-treated rats. In conclusion, T3S is an important intermediate in the in vivo metabolism of T3 in rats and accumulates in plasma if type I deiodination is inhibited.\r"

A balanced amino acid solution was, after a primed infusion, continuously infused for 2 h at each of three step-wise and increasing rates corresponding to 8.3, 16.7, 33.2 mg N/kg per h that were equivalent to 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 g N/kg per d. Flux of amino acids across the leg was compared with the flux of glucose, glycerol, lactate, free fatty acids, and oxygen. The size of the muscular tissue pool of amino acids was measured. Whole body amino acid oxidation was estimated by means of the continuous infusion of a 14C-labeled mixture of amino acids. Arterial steady state levels were obtained for most amino acids within 30 to 45 min after the primed constant infusion. Leg flux of amino acids switched from a net efflux after an overnight fast to a balanced flux between infusion rates corresponding to 0.2-0.4 g N/kg per d. At 0.8 g N/kg per d essentially all amino acids showed uptake. The infusion of amino acids stimulated leg uptake of glucose and lactate production and decreased FFA release. Oxygen uptake and leg blood flow increased significantly with increased infusion of amino acids. There was significant variability in transport rate among individual amino acids. Branched chain amino acids showed rapid transport and methionine slow transport rate. Only small changes in the muscle tissue concentration of certain amino acids were registered after 6 h of amino acid infusion despite uptake for several hours. When amino acids were infused at a rate corresponding to 0.8 g N/kg per d, the leg uptake of amino acids was 6% and the simultaneous whole body oxidation of infused amino acids was approximately 10%. Net uptake of leucine across the leg per hour was 62% of the muscle pool of free leucine when amino acids were infused at a rate corresponding to 0.4 g N/kg per d. Multiple regression analysis showed that the arterial concentration of an amino acid was the most important factor for uptake, more so than insulin concentration and blood flow. It is concluded that leg exchange of amino acids is large enough to rapidly change the pool size of the amino acids in skeletal muscle, if not counter-regulated by changes in rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Estimates of the capacity for protein synthesis and transfer RNA acceptor sites in muscles agree in order of magnitude with the net uptake of amino acids at high infusion rates of amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The electrical parameter used to define defibrillation strength is energy. Peak current, however, may more accurately reflect the field quantities (i.e., electric field strength and current density) that mediate defibrillation and therefore should be a better clinical descriptor of threshold than energy. Though transthoracic impedance is a major determinant of energy-based threshold and is sensitive to operator-dependent changes in impedance (electrode-subject interface), an ideal threshold descriptor should be invariant with respect to these changes in impedance. We therefore compared the relative invariance of energy- and current-based thresholds when transthoracic impedance was altered by one of two methods: (a) change in electrode size (protocol A) or (b) change in electrode force (protocol B). In protocol A, impedance was altered in each dog by a mean of 95%. Energy thresholds determined at both low and high impedance were 44 +/- 21 J (mean +/- SD) and 105 +/- 35 J, respectively, P less than 0.0001. In contrast, peak current (A) thresholds were independent of transthoracic impedance, 22 +/- 5 A (low impedance) vs. 24 +/- 6 A (high impedance), P = NS. Energy and current thresholds showed a similar relationship for animals tested in protocol B. Therefore, current-based thresholds, in contrast to energy thresholds are independent of operator-dependent variables of transthoracic impedance and are invariant for a given animal. These results suggest that redefining defibrillation threshold in terms of peak current rather than energy provides a superior method of defibrillation.\r"

These patterns make it possible to recognize two different genetically definable subgroups among histopathologically indistinguishable tumors. Additionally, we have identified a difference in neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzyme activity in these two subgroups of NB. The patterns of protooncogene expression and neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes suggests that these tumors arise in different cells of the PNS.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple components of vascular alpha adrenergic responsiveness were investigated in twenty-four men with mild hypertension and eighteen age- and weight-matched normotensive controls. Arterial plasma norepinephrine (paNE), an index of sympathetic drive, was increased in hypertensives compared to normotensives (mean +/- SE), 199 +/- 24 vs. 134 +/- 11 pg/ml, P less than 0.02. The effective concentration of intra-arterial (iaNE) increasing forearm vascular resistance (FAVR) 30% (NE-EC30, an index of vascular alpha-receptor sensitivity) was similar in normotensives and hypertensives, 9 +/- 1 vs. 13 +/- 3 ng/100 ml per min, respectively, P greater than 0.3. The phentolamine induced reduction in FAVR, an index of vascular alpha-tone, was greater in hypertensives, -21.3 +/- 1.8 vs. normotensives, -14.9 +/- 1.2 U, P less than 0.02. We interpret these data as evidence for normal vascular alpha-receptor sensitivity to norepinephrine in mild hypertensives. Consequently, the increased sympathetic drive in mild hypertensives explains the elevated vascular alpha-tone. Although vascular alpha-receptor sensitivity to iaNE was normal, the FAVR responses at high doses (reactivity) were greater in hypertensives to regional infusion of both NE and angiotensin II. This \"nonspecific\" enhancement of vascular reactivity is probably explained by structural vascular changes in hypertensives.\r"

Groups 2 and 6 received daily doses of methylprednisolone (MP). Groups 3 and 7 received MP plus the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), benzazepril. Groups 4 and 8 received CEI alone. Groups 1 through 4 underwent micropuncture study 2 wk after renal ablation. Untreated group 1 rats exhibited systemic hypertension and elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate due to glomerular capillary hyperperfusion and hypertension. Administration of MP in group 2 resulted in comparable systemic hypertension, with further elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate due to even higher values for glomerular perfusion and hydraulic pressure. Concurrent treatment with CEI in groups 3 and 4 controlled systemic and glomerular hypertension despite equivalent renal ablation and, in group 3, comparable doses of MP. Groups 5 through 8 were followed for 12 wk. Untreated group 1 rats demonstrated continued systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria, and eventual glomerular sclerosis. Addition of MP in group 6 dramatically accelerated the development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, while CEI (groups 7 and 8) afforded striking protection against disease progression. Thus, potent vasodilator glucocorticoids may amplify hemodynamically mediated glomerular injury, whereas control of systemic and glomerular hypertension prevents this undesirable consequence of chronic steroid therapy.\r"

After cisternal injection of autologous blood we documented spasm of the basilar artery upon angiography from 4 to 7 d postictus in six dogs. When these basilar arteries were isolated we observed marked membrane depolarization and enhanced electrical spike activity compared with controls. The slope of the membrane potential vs log [K]0 curve was significantly reduced in arteries exposed to SAH. Further analysis supported the concept that such altered muscle cell properties resulted from reduction in resting K+ conductance (gk). Exposure of arteries in vitro to nicorandil (10(-9)-10(-7)M) (a drug which acts by increasing gk) hyperpolarized the muscle cells and increased internal diameter. Infusion of nicorandil (3-5 micrograms/kg per min) to intact, anesthetized animals reversed, by 50%, the reduction in basilar artery diameter after experimental SAH.\r"

  ".W": "16, 16 Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2), a known cytoprotective agent, was examined for its ability to alter the course of fulminant hepatitis in an experimental model of fulminant viral hepatitis, murine hepatitis murine hepatitis type 3 (MHV-3). Fully susceptible BALB/cJ mice, infected with 100 50% lethal doses (LD50) of MHV-3 developed histologic and biochemical evidence of fulminant hepatitis, as evidenced by massive hepatic necrosis with hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and a markedly elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (mean, 1,402 +/- 619 IU/liter). In contrast, animals treated with dmPGE2 either before or after infection (up to 48 h) demonstrated a marked reduction in both histologic and biochemical evidence of liver damage as characterized by normal blood glucose, total CO2, and ALT determinations (mean ALT, 63 +/- 40 IU/liter). Treatment of infected mice with PGF2 alpha demonstrated no cytoprotective effects. High titers of infectious virus were recovered from the livers of both dmPGE2-treated and -untreated animals throughout the course of infection. In a parallel in vitro study, dmPGE2 (10(-4)-10(-8) M) demonstrated a similar cytoprotective effect on monolayers of isolated cultured hepatocytes from fully susceptible BALB/cJ mice infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0. In addition, splenic macrophages recovered from infected and untreated BALB/cJ mice demonstrated a marked augmentation in procoagulant activity (PCA) from a basal 10 +/- 5 mU/10(6) splenic macrophages to a maximum of 615 +/- 102 mU/10(6) splenic macrophages, whereas no increase in macrophage PCA was detected in infected animals treated with dmPGE2. These results suggest that dmPGE2, without detectably altering viral replication or infectivity in vivo, confers a marked cytoprotective effect on hepatocytes both in vivo and in vitro, and prevents the induction of macrophage PCA in vivo in fully susceptible BALB/cJ mice after murine hepatitis virus type 3 infection.\r"

Ten subjects received either saline or histamine (1, 20, 100, and 500 micrograms) by intranasal spray. Maximal nasal mucosal blood flow response, determined by laser doppler velocimetry, demonstrated a significant (P less than 0.05) linear relationship to histamine dose. Eight additional subjects received each of the following intranasal treatments: 20 micrograms histamine followed by 10 micrograms desmopressin; normal saline followed by 10 micrograms desmopressin; 20 micrograms histamine followed by vehicle; or normal saline and vehicle. Nasal blood flow was determined before and after each treatment. Desmopressin activity was assessed by measuring urine osmolality, flow rate, electrolyte, and creatinine concentration for 24 h after each treatment. The effect of histamine and desmopressin was greater than desmopressin alone, with respect to nasal blood flow response (103 +/- 24 vs. 4 +/- 17%, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.02), initial urine osmolality (520 +/- 123 vs. 333 +/- 75 mosM, P less than 0.03), urine electrolyte (potassium, 45 +/- 11 vs. 28 +/- 7 meq/liter; sodium, 68 +/- 21 vs. 36 +/- 8 meq/liter, P less than 0.03) and creatinine concentrations (95 +/- 23 vs. 60 +/- 13 mg/dl, P less than 0.03), and the duration of decrease in urine flow rate compared with saline and vehicle. These results suggest that the systemic activity of intranasal desmopressin is enhanced by increasing local nasal blood flow and are consistent with increased transnasal absorption of the peptide.\r"

A twofold increase in the cellular content of these mRNAs was observed within 4 h of exposure to 8-bromo-cAMP, and was maintained for up to 48 h. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not prevent the hCG- or 8-bromo-cAMP-stimulated accumulation of either cytochrome P450scc or adrenodoxin mRNAs. We conclude that human granulosa cells respond rapidly to hCG and cAMP analogues with a coordinate increase in levels of the mRNAs encoding two key proteins of the steroidogenic machinery, and that this stimulation does not require synthesis of a protein intermediate.\r"

The main factors influencing success were the aspirator, the small size of many cancers, and the occult nature of the lesions seen only on mammography. Retrospective analysis of the figures shows that combining the results of FNA cytology in a triple assessment with physical and mammographical findings for restricted selection means that the number of benign biopsy specimens could be reduced considerably.\r"

Significant correlations (p less than 0.001) between serum albumin and transferrin concentrations and arm muscle area were found for men but not for women. Poor nutritional specificity and sensitivity of some anthropometric and biochemical tests may account for the difference in the level of undernutrition found by these tests and clinical assessment.

Biopsy specimens of papules demonstrated a thickened and dense dermis. The subcutaneous fibrous trabeculae were thin, with resultant poor compartmentalization of the fat. Painful piezogenic pedal papules are due to herniation of subcutaneous fat into the dermis, which is possibly due to structural defects of the connective tissue. The high prevalence of painful piezogenic pedal papules in our group of patients (34.5%) makes its direct association with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome highly feasible, most probably because of the connective tissue defect that occurs in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\r"

Skin disease was common both in patients with AIDS and in those with AIDS-related complex. The most common cutaneous findings were candidiasis in 55 patients (47.0%), dermatophytosis in 35 (30%), herpes simplex infections in 26 (22%), molluscum contagiosum in 11 (9%), seborrheic dermatitis in 37 (32%), and acquired ichthyosis or xerosis in 36 (30%). Several cutaneous conditions previously reported in association with AIDS were infrequently seen: Psoriasis was seen in only one patient, and deep fungal infections and basal and squamous cell carcinomas were seen in none. No significant differences were noted in the prevalence of skin disease between patients with AIDS and those with AIDS-related complex, although xerosis and ichthyosiform skin changes tended to be more common in those with AIDS. The yellow nail syndrome and \"a papular eruption\" associated with AIDS were seen. Skin diseases also tended to be widespread and severe in the patients studied.\r"

It is more potent than ketoconazole, is better absorbed with food, and does not suppress testosterone or cortisol synthesis. In previous studies, daily 200 mg doses of itraconazole for 5 days cleared 80% of cases of pityriasis versicolor, and 90% of dermatophyte infections were cleared by daily 100 mg doses administered for 1 month. Twenty patients with superficial dermatophyte, Candida albicans, and pityriasis versicolor infections were treated with doses of 50 or 100 mg per day; in the first group of 10 patients, the drug was administered before breakfast and the other 10 patients were given their dose with breakfast. Itraconazole concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography 3 hours after administration of first and last doses. Our findings showed that although treatment with 50-mg doses led to poorer results and lower plasma levels than 100-mg doses, taking the drug with breakfast gave much better results than taking it before.\r"

UVA radiation was supplied from either a filtered solar simulator (indoors) or filtered sunlight (outdoors). Five formulations were tested: 3% butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane and 7% padimate O, 7% padimate O, 5% octyl salicylate, and 3% oxybenzone, 3% butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane alone, 7% padimate O alone, and vehicle. Sunscreen protection against the erythemogenic effect of UVA radiation was expressed as phototoxic protection factors. The phototoxic protection factor for each sunscreen was derived from a ratio of the minimal phototoxic dose of UVA radiation that produced delayed erythema on sunscreen-protected and unprotected skin. The combination of 3% butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane and 7% padimate O provided significantly greater protection than the other sunscreen formulations, and for each sunscreen the phototoxic protection factors determined indoors and outdoors were comparable.\r"

This discrepancy may be attributed to an increase in ultraviolet exposure due to lifestyle and latitude, but arsenic exposure may also have played a role. Nonmelanoma skin cancer in Japanese in Hawaii appears to be a significant problem that has not been appreciated because these malignancies are not reportable to tumor registries.\r"

There was a striking tendency to overdiagnose infectious dermatoses such as bacterial pyodermas, superficial mycoses, scabies, and herpes simplex and to underdiagnose inflammatory dermatoses such as contact dermatitis, nummular dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, and psoriasis. In 218 cases (68%) the error probably could have been prevented if the following diagnostic criteria were considered mandatory: positive culture or potassium hydroxide preparation for dermatophytosis or candidiasis, positive Tzanck smear or viral culture for herpes simplex, zoster, or varicella, and demonstration of ectoparasite for scabies. These findings have implications for the medical education of primary care physicians and for the practitioner who handles cutaneous disorders.\r"

Recently we encountered a 25-year-old white woman who had developed this syndrome but without juvenile cataracts, hypogonadism, or mental retardation. She had developed a basal cell epithelioma, which has not previously been described in this syndrome. Phototesting with monochromatic radiation and with a solar simulator showed photosensitivity in the ultraviolet A range but not in the ultraviolet B range.

In vaporizational applications, target tissue volumes are flash vaporized before significant heat can be transferred to surrounding tissue, promoting faster wound healing and reduced scarring. The superpulse feature may significantly change the way in which the carbon dioxide laser is used in cutaneous surgery.\r"

The ELC density was not significantly different between lung tumor patients (1024 +/- 167) and COPD-S (1072 +/- 200, p less than 0.4) control patients, and we found no significant correlation between ELC density and tumor cell type, presence or absence of metastases, tumor stage, or present smoking status. Although we did detect that systemic GCS therapy significantly reduced the ELC density in COPD + S patients (910 +/- 211, p less than 0.05); use of inhaled or chronic low dose (less than or equal to 20 mg daily) GCS did not appear to significantly alter ELC density. In addition, anergy to epicutaneous dinitrochlorobenzene in CA and COPD + S patients positively correlated with a reduction in ELC density, suggesting a possible functional deficit arising from the numerical change. Further investigation is needed to elucidate whether factor(s) other than a reduction in ELC density are involved in the anergic state.\r"

Two to six days later a surface area comparable to the human face (16 cm2) was delineated on the abdomen. Baker's phenol or 50% TCA was applied to this area. Cardiac rate and rhythm and arterial pressure were monitored. Once stable, the same agent was applied to the entire abdomen for further study. TCA has been shown to be a safer agent than phenol in this rat model. Assuming that this model simulates the human response, monitoring would appear to be indicated during full-face Baker's phenol peeling.\r"

Anginal pain interviews, continuous two-dimensional echocardiographic recordings and 12 lead ECG recordings at 10 second intervals were obtained for the first two inflation sequences. Seventeen patients had angina with both inflations (symptomatic group), seven patients had no angina or related symptoms during either inflation (asymptomatic group) and six patients had both painful and painless inflations (mixed response group). Comparison of the three groups revealed that they did not differ in mean age, sex distribution, prior history of angina or the incidence of comorbid conditions. Echocardiographic measurements of global and regional left ventricular dysfunction during balloon inflation were comparable in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the time to onset or magnitude of ST segment changes. The results of the wall motion and ECG studies in the mixed response group paralleled the results in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, with no significant differences in any of the variables measured between the painful and painless inflations. These data demonstrate that silent myocardial ischemia occurs in an appreciable proportion of patients during coronary angioplasty and the absence of angina does not imply that a lesser amount of myocardium is jeopardized than with painful inflations.\r"

Holter monitor-detected myocardial ischemia, defined as ST segment depression or elevation greater than or equal to 1 mm, was present in 10 patients (28%). These 10 patients had a total of 39 ischemic episodes of 3 to 144 minutes' duration, with a total cumulative duration of 398 minutes. None of the 10 had Holter monitor-detected ischemia after successful angioplasty (p less than 0.01). Treadmill exercise duration increased by 29% after coronary angioplasty (p less than 0.01), and peak exercise heart rate-systolic blood pressure product increased by 27% (p less than 0.01). Thus, Holter monitor-detected myocardial ischemia is a relatively uncommon finding in patients with predominant single vessel coronary artery disease undergoing coronary angioplasty. When such ischemia is present, it is eliminated by successful coronary angioplasty.\r"

This pressure has been shown to reflect actual (visible) and potential (recruitable) collateral flow to the stenosed artery, distal to the angioplasty site. In 100 consecutive vessels (91 patients) for which coronary wedge pressure had been measured at the time of angioplasty, the long-term (7 +/- 3 months) angiographic results was evaluated. The overall angiographic restenosis rate was 37%. It was 52% (25 of 48) in arteries with a coronary wedge pressure greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg and 23% (12 of 52) in arteries with a coronary wedge pressure less than 30 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The mean coronary wedge pressure was 30 +/- 10 mm Hg for vessels with restenosis and 26 +/- 9 mm Hg for those without restenosis (p less than 0.01). The prevalence of angiographically visible collateral flow was 42% and 29%, respectively (p = NS). Neither age, sex, presence of unstable angina, left ventricular function, number of diseased vessels nor initial and final transstenotic pressure gradient and degree of stenosis were significantly associated with the long-term outcome after angioplasty. Restenosis rate is significantly increased when coronary wedge pressure measured at the time of angioplasty is high (greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg). This suggests a negative influence of competitive collateral flow on long-term results of angioplasty.\r"

The average follow-up period was 3.8 years. There were three in-hospital and six late deaths. Five (56%) of the nine postoperative deaths were of cardiac-related causes. The mean 7 year survival rate was 83 +/- 5%. Preoperative left ventricular end-systolic volume index was the most important indicator (p less than 0.001) for subsequent cardiac death. The 6.5 year survival rate was 92 +/- 4% for patients with an end-systolic volume index less than 200 ml/m2 compared with 51 +/- 16% for those whose index was greater than 200 ml/m2. None of the 48 patients with an end-systolic volume index less than 200 ml/m2 died of cardiac-related causes. Twenty-three of the 48 patients with an end-systolic volume index less than 200 ml/m2 (Group 1) and 6 of the 12 patients with a higher index (Group 2) underwent repeat catheterization 26 months postoperatively. Preoperative afterload, assessed by end-systolic wall stress, was elevated in both groups, but decreased postoperatively, becoming identical to the afterload in 20 normal control subjects. Although the preoperative ejection fraction was depressed in both groups, the great majority of patients in Group 1, compared with none in Group 2, exhibited normal ejection fraction postoperatively. Thus, in patients who recently underwent surgery for aortic regurgitation, satisfactory late results in both long-term survival and reversal of left ventricular dysfunction were obtained when the preoperative end-systolic volume index was less than 200 ml/m2.\r"

Consistent with this anatomy, evidence of inferior wall ischemia was significantly more frequent in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 by thallium-201 scintigraphy (91 versus 7%) and by contrast left ventriculography (91 versus 13%).

In the present study early serial measurements of fibrinopeptide A were used to further characterize this paradoxic increase in thrombin activity after streptokinase and to characterize its response to heparin. In 19 patients with acute myocardial infarction fibrinopeptide A was elevated to 82.3 +/- 43.5 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) before therapy. Thirty minutes after the initiation of streptokinase, fibrinopeptide A increased to 300.1 +/- 117.4 ng/ml (p less than 0.01), consistent with extensive thrombin activity. Fibrinopeptide A remained elevated until 15 minutes after a heparin bolus injection when levels decreased to 15% of the poststreptokinase value (49.2 +/- 13.3 ng/ml) (p less than 0.001).

In this study, rest and immediate postexercise echocardiograms were performed in 123 patients who were stratified on the basis of prior myocardial infarction and the number and location of coronary artery stenoses at cardiac catheterization. The location of wall motion abnormalities on rest and postexercise studies was correlated with the location of coronary artery stenoses. The sensitivity of exercise echocardiography for detecting coronary artery disease in patients with multivessel disease was 97% in those with and 86% in those without prior infarction. The corresponding sensitivity for patients with single vessel disease was 100% and 72%, respectively. Multivessel disease was present in 59 patients, but specifically identified as such in only 32 (54%). Normal rest and exercise echocardiograms were seen in 12 patients with coronary artery disease, 8 of whom had single vessel disease. It is concluded that the subjective analysis of the exercise echocardiogram accurately identifies the majority of patients with coronary artery disease. Its sensitivity is greatest in those with multivessel coronary disease. It is limited in those with single vessel coronary disease and in accurately identifying the subset of patients with multivessel disease.\r"

The flow during the isovolumic relaxation period was demonstrated in 60 subjects, including 7 with a normal heart, 26 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 10 with aortic valve disease, 9 with a transplanted heart and 8 others. All had normal to hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function with some degree of cavity obliteration as seen in the apical two-dimensional echocardiographic views. In contrast, this isovolumic relaxation period flow could not be demonstrated in the absence of cavity obliteration in any of 20 patients with either normal or diminished left ventricular systolic function. Isovolumic relaxation period flow was best recorded from the apical transducer position and was directed toward the apex in all patients. By pulsed wave, and with two-dimensional Doppler ultrasound, the isovolumic relaxation period flow originated within a narrow area in the medial portion of the left ventricle along the middle or basal segments of the interventricular septum, but was recorded over a larger area toward the apex. The peak isovolumic relaxation period flow velocity was recorded just basal to the area of cavity obliteration, usually at the level of the papillary muscles, and ranged from 0.4 to 2.3 m/s (mean of 1.0 m/s). This isovolumic relaxation period flow started with aortic valve closure and, in 50 of the 60 patients, it lasted throughout isovolumic relaxation until mitral valve opening. In the other 10 patients (all with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), it lasted for only a part (mean 63%) of this period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thallium-201 uptake and clearance after dipyridamole infusion may differ from that after exercise stress because the hemodynamic effects of these two interventions are different. In this study of normal volunteers, thallium kinetics after dipyridamole (n = 13) were determined from three serial image sets (early, intermediate and delayed) and from serial blood samples and compared with thallium kinetics after exercise (n = 15). Absolute myocardial thallium uptake was greater after dipyridamole compared with exercise (p less than 0.0001), although the relative myocardial distribution was similar. The myocardial clearance (%/h) of thallium was slower after dipyridamole than it was after exercise. Comparing dipyridamole and exercise, the differences in clearance were large from the early to the intermediate image (anterior, -11 +/- 17 versus 24 +/- 5, p = 0.0005; 50 degrees left anterior oblique, -7 +/- 11 versus 15 +/- 8, p = 0.004; 70 degrees left anterior oblique, 3 +/- 9 versus 21 +/- 6, p = 0.001). In contrast, the differences in clearance were small from the intermediate to the delayed image (anterior, 15 +/- 4 versus 20 +/- 2, p = 0.025; 50 degrees left anterior oblique, 15 +/- 4 versus 19 +/- 3, p = 0.13; 70 degrees left anterior oblique, 15 +/- 3 versus 18 +/- 2, p = 0.047). Thallium uptake and clearance in the liver, splanchnic region and spleen were greater after dipyridamole (p less than 0.001). Blood thallium levels were greater after dipyridamole (p less than 0.05) and cleared more slowly (p = 0.07). Thus, myocardial thallium-201 uptake and clearance after dipyridamole infusion differ from thallium kinetics after exercise. This difference is, in part, related to associated differences in extracardiac and blood kinetics. Diagnostic criteria for the detection of abnormal thallium-201 clearance must be specific for the type of intervention.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism and time of onset of ventricular dysfunction after mitral valve replacement, 18 patients with pure, severe mitral regurgitation (of whom 10 underwent mitral valve repair and 8 standard mitral valve replacement with papillary muscle excision) were studied by intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiography immediately before and immediately after the operative procedure. No patient sustained a perioperative myocardial infarction or had any residual mitral regurgitation. Although preoperative hemodynamics were similar, postoperatively the patients with valve repair had a lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure than did the patients with valve replacement (8.6 +/- 1.9 versus 14.4 +/- 7.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.04). Although intraoperative echocardiographic ejection fraction fell significantly after mitral valve replacement (0.64 +/- 0.11 to 0.40 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.0001), it was maintained after valve repair (0.44 +/- 0.20 to 0.49 +/- 0.16, p = NS). Additionally, regional myocardial contractile abnormalities in the anterior and posterior septum were detected immediately after the procedure by intraoperative echocardiography in the patients with valve replacement, but not in those with repair. These postoperative regional contractile abnormalities after papillary muscle resection have not been described previously. Resection of the papillary muscles may disrupt the muscle bundle alignment and induce contractile abnormalities remote from the excised muscle. This study demonstrated that significant global and regional ventricular dysfunction develops immediately after removal of the papillary muscles, whereas myocardial contractility is preserved in patients undergoing mitral valve repair. Therefore, with intraoperative echocardiography to assure minimal residual regurgitation, surgeons should attempt to preserve ventricular function by performing mitral valve reconstruction in patients with mitral regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "High frequency alternating current ablation of an accessory pathway was performed in a patient with incessant circus movement tachycardia using a right-sided, free wall accessory pathway. Antiarrhythmic drugs, antitachycardia pacing and transvenous catheter ablation using high energy direct current shocks could not control the supraventricular tachycardia. A 7F bipolar electrode catheter with an interelectrode distance of 1.2 cm was positioned at the site of earliest retrograde activation during circus movement tachycardia. At this area, two alternating current high frequency impulses were delivered with an energy output of 50 W through the distal tip of the bipolar catheter, while the patient was awake. After the first shock supraventricular tachycardia terminated and accessory pathway conduction was absent without altering anterograde conduction in the normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction system. No reports of pain or other complications were noted. In short-term follow-up of 5 months, the patient had been free of arrhythmias without antiarrhythmic medication. Thus, high frequency alternating current ablation was performed for the first time in the treatment of an arrhythmia incorporating an accessory pathway in a human. This technique may be an attractive alternative to the available transcatheter ablation techniques and to antitachycardia surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence and determinants of multiple morphologically distinct ventricular tachycardias were examined prospectively in 71 consecutive patients with at least one documented spontaneous episode of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Mean frontal and horizontal QRS axes were determined from the 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 190 spontaneous and 352 induced tachycardias. Two or more morphologically distinct spontaneous tachycardias were observed in 19 (43%) of 44 patients who had at least two documented spontaneous episodes. In 43 (61%) of the 71 patients, multiple morphologically distinct tachycardias were induced by programmed ventricular stimulation. Overall, 57 (80%) of the 71 patients had at least two morphologically distinct tachycardias. Predictors of multiple tachycardia configurations were selected by multivariate analysis from clinical and angiographic variables and were similar for both spontaneous and induced ventricular tachycardia: presence of multiple previous myocardial infarctions (p = 0.032 spontaneous, p = 0.005 induced) and number of different antiarrhythmic drug treatments during which ventricular tachycardia was documented (p = 0.0089 spontaneous, p less than 0.0001 induced). These data demonstrate that a large majority of patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia exhibit more than one distinct QRS configuration when adequate ECG documentation of multiple episodes is obtained during different antiarrhythmic drug treatments. In individual patients, caution should be used in attributing clinical significance to a single unique QRS configuration.\r"

The tear split through a relatively undistensible intima in 9 (75%) of the 12 sites. Two successfully dilated sites with prior thrombosis showed an intraintimal tear with a widely lacerated fibrous cap and thin mural thrombus. After dilation, the occluded prior nonthrombosed site showed marked protrusion of a separated plaque. An occluded prior thrombosed site after dilation revealed intraintimal canal-like hematoma. Four sites that occluded after balloon passage revealed a dissecting hematoma in three and plaque disruption in the other.\r"

Among the eight patients, permanent pacing was instituted in three who were unsuccessfully treated with both a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and left cardiothoracic sympathectomy, and in two who proved refractory or intolerant to beta-blockers. Another three patients had pacemaker implantation and long-term beta-blocker therapy because of spontaneous atrioventricular (AV) block in one, aborted sudden death in one and patient preference in one. After pacing (70 to 85 beats/min), there was no significant change in the mean corrected QT interval, but the mean QT interval decreased significantly (534.4 +/- 51.4 to 425.6 +/- 18.9 ms, p less than 0.0001). Over a mean follow-up period of 35.1 +/- 18.9 months, all patients are alive and currently free of syncope. One patient without a history of stress-induced syncope had two syncopal episodes (believed to be due to hyperventilation) while under severe emotional stress, but has been symptom free for the past 5 years. One patient with an atrial demand (AAI) pacemaker developed dizziness due to documented episodes of AV block, but remains asymptomatic after conversion to atrial rate-responsive dual chamber (DDD) pacing. Either atrial or ventricular pacing combined with beta-blocker therapy appears to be effective treatment for a subset of patients with the long QT syndrome, by either preventing episodes of torsade de pointes or alleviating symptoms due to bradycardia from beta-blocker therapy.\r"

No patient had structural or ischemic cardiac disease. In Group 1 patients, hemodynamic abnormalities were subtle, but invasive study demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy in two patients and restrictive cardiomyopathy in nine. In Group 2, eight patients had dilated cardiomyopathy and three had restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac biopsy results were abnormal in all 22 patients and the abnormalities were similar for the two groups. Cardiac histologic study revealed a spectrum of abnormalities including fibrosis, dilated sarcoplasmic reticulum, increased numbers of intercalated discs and mitochondrial abnormalities. Histologic abnormalities of skeletal muscle were similar in each group, consisting of endomysial fibrosis and increased lipid deposits. Slightly more than half of the Group 1 and Group 2 patients also had a low concentration of skeletal muscle long chain acylcarnitine. These data demonstrate that abnormalities of both cardiac and skeletal muscle are common in patients with cardiomyopathy; abnormalities are similar whether initial symptoms are due to ventricular tachycardia or congestive heart failure. It is suggested that these patients with cardiomyopathy may have a generalized myopathy.\r"

This report describes 21 patients with incessant ventricular tachycardia present greater than 90% of the day and night; the age at diagnosis ranged from birth to 30 months (mean 10.5 months). The most common clinical presentation was cardiac arrest (11 patients, in 5 after digitalis for presumed supraventricular tachycardia); another 6 patients had congestive heart failure and 4 were asymptomatic. Three patients had coexisting Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The rate of incessant ventricular tachycardia ranged from 167 to 440 (mean 260 beats/min) and the QRS duration from 0.06 to 0.11 second. The most common electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern (10 of 21) was right bundle branch block with left axis deviation, but other right and left bundle branch block patterns were observed. Conventional and investigational antiarrhythmic agents (nine patients received amiodarone) failed to eliminate incessant ventricular tachycardia in all. Electrophysiologic studies localized incessant ventricular tachycardia to the left ventricle in 17 (to the apex in 2, the free wall in 9 and the septum in 6) and to the right ventricular septum in 4. No structural abnormalities were found on the echocardiogram or angiocardiogram. All 21 patients had surgery at an age of 3.5 to 31 months (mean 16). In 15 a tumor was found: 13 myocardial hamartomas (9 discrete, 4 diffuse throughout both ventricles) and 2 rhabdomyomas (1 multiple). Myocarditis was found in one patient (the oldest). In four, only myocardial fibrosis was found; results of one biopsy were normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Quantitative side effects questionnaire scores were used to guide disopyramide administration in 20 men with ventricular tachycardia. Disopyramide was given to each patient both with placebo and with active pyridostigmine. The maximal administered dose for each regimen was used in conjunction with corresponding questionnaire scores to calculate an index or estimate of the maximal tolerable dose of disopyramide. Additional evaluations performed at baseline and at each maximal administered dose regimen included tear and saliva quantitation, 24 hour electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise testing and programmed ventricular stimulation. Results showed that the maximal administered dose of disopyramide was greater with active pyridostigmine than with placebo: 295 +/- 75 versus 245 +/- 100 mg every 6 hours (p less than 0.05). The calculated maximal tolerable dose was substantially greater in the presence of pyridostigmine: 355 +/- 90 versus 260 +/- 115 mg every 6 hours (p less than 0.001). Maximal side effects questionnaire scores also reflected decreased anticholinergic activity in the presence of pyridostigmine compared with placebo: 101.9 +/- 2.2 versus 104.6 +/- 2.8, respectively (p less than 0.005).

The responses of plasma renin activity and catecholamines were also assessed. Nicardipine induced significant reductions of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure under conditions of rest and peak exercise (p less than 0.001), mediated by reversal of vasoconstriction (p less than 0.001). Overall, cardiac index and stroke volume index responses were not significantly altered by nicardipine. Although rest pulmonary wedge pressure was unchanged (6 +/- 3 to 5 +/- 4 mm Hg), peak exercise pulmonary wedge pressure decreased from 24 +/- 22 to 7 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) with nicardipine therapy. This effect of nicardipine on pulmonary wedge pressure was present across all work loads studied, and was accompanied by reduction of peak exercise pulmonary artery pressure from 43 +/- 10 to 25 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Oxygen consumption was unchanged, associated with reduction of arteriovenous oxygen difference (p less than 0.02). Both plasma renin activity (p less than 0.05) and norepinephrine (p less than 0.005) were significantly increased with nicardipine therapy. Thus, nicardipine produced significant blood pressure reduction by reversal of vasoconstriction in patients with essential hypertension. The preservation of cardiac output, with markedly reduced pulmonary wedge pressure, indicated that nicardipine improved ventricular performance in response to reversal of vasoconstriction.\r"

The sapphire contact probe catheter consisted of a round 2.2 mm diameter synthetic sapphire attached to an 8F catheter into which a 0.2 mm diameter optical fiber was inserted with the distal tip maintained at 3 mm from the sapphire. The lensed fiber catheter consisted of a 0.2 mm optical fiber at the end of which a 1 mm diameter lens was made. The fiber was inserted into a 5F low profile balloon catheter with the lens maintained 3 mm beyond the catheter tip. During laser emissions the catheter tips were maintained in a stationary position in contact with tissue targets immersed in blood at an angle of 90 degrees. The diameter of holes at the entry and exit of craters, the depth of craters and thermal injury to adjacent tissue (rim of carbonization and vacuolization) were measured with microscopy. The volume of tissue removed was derived from these values. Controlled effect index was determined as the ratio of diameter of holes and the extent of thermal injury.

However, few studies have correlated relatively rapid changes in regional myocardial function (sonomicrometers) and blood flow (microspheres) with high energy phosphate concentrations measured using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in intact large animal models of regional myocardial ischemia. The left anterior descending coronary artery of mongrel dogs was abruptly occluded for 17.1 +/- 1.9 minutes and then completely released; measurements were made for an additional 22 minutes.

Phosphocreatine (PCr) measured during 4.4 minute sampling intervals decreased to steady state within the first sampling period after occlusion and was 45.9 +/- 17.0% of control at the end of the occlusion, whereas beta-adenosine triphosphate (beta-ATP) reached its lowest level early after reperfusion (72.7 +/- 13.3% of control). The ratio of PCr to inorganic phosphate (Pi) decreased during the occlusion (3.34 +/- 0.75 versus 1.01 +/- 0.61) but returned to control level early during reperfusion. The ratio of PCr to beta-ATP also decreased during coronary occlusion (2.16 +/- 0.39 versus 1.29 +/- 0.39) but did not return to control level during reperfusion. Significant correlations were observed between the intensity of ischemia (reduced blood flow) and reductions in regional contractile function, PCr, beta-ATP, myocardial pH and the increase in Pi during the coronary occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The validity of cardiac nuclear magnetic resonance imaging for determination of left ventricular myocardial mass was evaluated in nine dogs. A gated spin echo-pulsing sequence was used for in vivo imaging, obtaining 0.7 cm thick slices of the heart spaced by 1 cm. On each imaged slice, the left ventricular surface area was reproducibly determined by planimetry and was multiplied by slice spacing and specific gravity of the myocardium (1.05) to obtain slice mass. Total left ventricular mass was calculated by adding slice masses in short-axis (method I), transaxial (method II) and vertical long-axis (method III) orientations using Simpson's rule. With each method, masses of the portions of the left ventricle subject to partial volume effect either were not accounted for or alternatively were estimated from the same or an orthogonal imaging plane. Calculated left ventricular mass was compared with the actual excised left ventricular weight. With NMR imaging of in situ nonbeating hearts, best results were obtained when either method I or method II was used and partial volume effect was estimated either from the same or an orthogonal plane. With in vivo NMR imaging, best results were noted when method I was used and mass of the partial volume apex was calculated from transaxial slices: Y (in vivo NMR image) = 8.3 + 0.99X, r = 0.996, SEE = 3.14. For this method, the interobserver reliability coefficient and standard error of the measurement were 0.97 and 5.4, respectively. Compared with method I, in vivo methods II and III were associated with larger errors (SEE ranging from 13.03 to 19.03) regardless of the approach used to estimate partial volume effect. It is concluded that NMR imaging is a highly accurate noninvasive method for in vivo measurement of left ventricular mass in dogs and offers promise for accurate measurement of left ventricular mass in patients.\r"

Before the shock, the amplitudes of the atrial and ventricular electrograms recorded from the distal electrodes were compared (A/V ratio), and the atrial pacing threshold was determined. To assess effects on function and arrhythmogenicity, right heart pressures were measured and programmed ventricular stimulation was performed before the shock and prior to sacrifice 7 to 10 days after the shock. Nine dogs received a total of 24 discharges at varying energies (50 to 400 J). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred with 13 shocks (62%) and transient atrioventricular block with 9 shocks (43%). There was no worsening in cardiac or valvular function as determined by right heart pressure measurements or right ventriculography. Programmed ventricular stimulation performed before the shocks and repeated before sacrifice failed to induce ventricular arrhythmias. The endocardial lesion produced by the shock was roughly circular and its area correlated with both the magnitude of the shock as well as the atrial pacing threshold. Transmural necrosis always occurred at the anulus when the A/V ratio was between 1.00 and 1.50 and preshock atrial pacing threshold suggested adequate wall contact (less than 1.5 mA). There was mild inflammation of the adventitia of the right coronary artery near two discharge sites (both 200 J) and inflammation of the media near one discharge site (400 J); no intimal involvement was seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To separate the effects of altered loading from those of asynchrony, the effects of right ventricular pacing and sequential AV pacing on the rate of isovolumic pressure decline (relaxation time constant), myocardial (segment) lengthening rate and chamber (minor axis dimension) filling rate were examined. In 12 open chest anesthetized dogs, left ventricular pressure (micromanometer) and either left ventricular free wall segment length transients (n = 6) or minor axis dimension transients (n = 6) were measured during right atrial, right ventricular and sequential AV pacing; length and dimension were measured using ultrasonic crystals. Compared with right atrial pacing, right ventricular pacing produced a decrease in systolic pressure, a reduction in fractional shortening, a prolongation of the relaxation time constant (23.5 +/- 0.7 to 29.8 +/- 0.8 ms, p less than 0.05), slower peak segment lengthening rate (6.2 +/- 0.6 to 4.6 +/- 0.8 s-1, p less than 0.05) and a slower rate of increase in chamber dimension (3.5 +/- 0.1 to 2.7 +/- 0.1 s-1, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of four main antigenic peaks identified by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, one antigenic peak (Ag 4) was demonstrated to be antigenically closely related to and with similar molecular weight (approximately 22 kd) and isoelectric point values as urinary prealbumin, already recognized as a major rat allergen. Ag 4 was present in all dusts studied and was also identified as a minor component of saliva. However, no component with the same electrophoretic mobility or physicochemical characteristics of the alpha 2-euglobulin of male rat urine that shares partial identity with the prealbumin was detected, even in dust collected from a male rat room. A second high molecular weight (greater than 200 kd) component, Ag 1, present in most of the dust extracts, could not be detected in either urine or saliva. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis and skin prick tests confirmed the allergenicity of both these antigens. Analysis of an air filter sample taken within a male rat room revealed significant amounts of the \"prealbumin\" component, and a monospecific antiserum to this component was used to quantitate levels in dusts collected from various locations. These findings suggest that a major inhalant allergen present in rat dust is closely related to urinary prealbumin but that this and other allergenic components may not be derived predominantly from rat urine or saliva but possibly from secretions originating from the skin of the animals and present in the fur.\r"

The two groups were well matched regarding age, sex, skin sensitivity, HBV-specific serum IgE and IgG antibodies, and history of reactions after a field sting; mPEG-HBV-treated patients received doses that increased more steeply than doses of the HBV-treated patients. The maintenance dose of the former group (200 micrograms) was greater than that of the latter group (100 micrograms). During IT, both groups had the same frequency of local swellings after injections. Four patients receiving mPEG-HBV developed one mild systemic reaction (SR) during dose increase, whereas 10 patients receiving HBV demonstrated one or more of these reactions, compelling two patients to stop therapy. Following challenge with a honeybee sting after about 14 weeks of IT, six patients with SR were observed, four in the mPEG-HBV-treated group and two in the HBV-treated group. In the HBV-treated group, three patients were not challenged, one because of an insufficient IgG increase and two other patients because they dropped out of IT before reaching maintenance dose because of repeated SRs. Since the mPEG-HBV is extremely well tolerated during IT and the success rate is not significantly lower than with unmodified HBV, we suggest it as an attractive alternative to HBV for the treatment of HBV hypersensitivity. Increase of the maintenance dose may result in an even better clinical efficacy.\r"

Human lung fragments responded to the extract of grain dust by releasing histamine in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, leukotrienes (B4, D4, and E4 were also found to be released. The action of grain dust appeared to be independent of the complement pathway or cell cytotoxicity since the lung tissue released the chemical mediators in the absence of plasma and responded to further reaction with compound 48/80 after interaction with grain dust. These data demonstrate that grain-dust extract may induce the release of mediators of anaphylaxis by a nonimmunologic process. This may explain the occurrence of acute bronchoconstriction in some of the grain workers.\r"

Symptoms in several of these women may be provoked by gonadotropins or progesterone (P) and improved by ovarian suppression, with long-term remissions noted in several patients after oophorectomy. Since adverse reactions to P might explain this association, the effects of P and estrogen on basophil histamine release from these patients were studied. Eight patients and 10 control subjects were examined. Neither estrogen nor P caused histamine release from the basophils of patients or control subjects. Moreover, anti-IgE-induced histamine release was not influenced by P or estrogen. Attempts to culture basophils for 24 hours revealed that basophil preparations from eight of 10 normal subjects but only three of eight patients retained the capacity to respond to anti-IgE after 24 hours (p = 0.088). Culture with dexamethasone reduced anti-IgE-induced histamine release in all subjects, and the possibility that P might interfere with the effect of dexamethasone was also studied. P failed to affect dexamethasone-induced reduction of basophil histamine release. Therefore, P and estradiol appear to have no effect on basophils from either patients with hormone-related exacerbations of anaphylaxis or from control subjects.\r"

Immunoblot studies were performed with sera from allergic individuals with blots prepared from denatured SDS-PAGE gels and from two types of nondenaturing gels. The nondenaturing systems demonstrated the presence of two major allergens and three other allergens, each reacting with a third of the sera. Three of the allergens detected in SDS-PAGE blots were of identical mobility to the three major proteins in the pure venom sample. IgE binding to the SDS-PAGE blots was significantly less than that to nondenaturing blots, suggesting that much of the allergenic activity is conformation dependent.\r"

In this article, we review our experience with rapid intravenous desensitization for patients who gave a history of PCN allergy and who had hypersensitivity demonstrated by skin tests. Skin testing was performed with both prick and intradermal techniques and with the recommended antibiotic as well as PCN G, penicilloyl polylysine, and a minor determinant mixture. Patients were transferred to the intensive care unit, and desensitization was performed with a buret technique that required minimal preparation and was easily applied to any antibiotic. Fifteen desensitizations in 12 patients were associated with no immediate reactions. One patient developed a delayed reaction consisting of a pruritic rash and angioedema. A second patient developed a more serious delayed serum sickness-like illness with fever, rash, eosinophilia, abnormal liver function tests, and urinary abnormalities. These reactions did not necessitate stopping the antibiotic, although the latter patient required corticosteroids to suppress his symptoms. Rapid intravenous desensitization is a rapid, safe, and effective technique for patients demonstrating hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics who require therapy with these medications.\r"

  ".U": "87309426\r", 
  ".W": "Allergen challenge of allergic patients with asthma caused various changes in the beta-receptor-adenylate cyclase system of lymphocyte membranes from these patients. These changes included uncoupling and down regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and nonspecific refractoriness of adenylate cyclase, as demonstrated by reduced responses to isoproterenol (beta 2), histamine (H2), 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, and sodium fluoride. Since these changes could be due to desensitization by enhanced plasma levels of catecholamines and/or histamine during the allergic response, we explored the effects of these agonists on the beta-receptor-adenylate cyclase system in vitro with normal lymphocytes. In addition, we assessed the effect of the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), on this system, since phorbol esters have been demonstrated to modulate several receptor systems, presumably via activation of protein kinase C. That both the agonists and PMA may cause refractoriness of lymphocyte adenylate cyclase was demonstrated, but, however, by apparently different mechanisms. The agonists isoproterenol and histamine induced only a specific desensitization of the homologous responses, whereas PMA-induced refractoriness was nonspecific in nature. Radioligand-binding studies demonstrated that both uncoupling and down regulation contributed to the isoproterenol-induced beta-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness, whereas beta-adrenergic receptor uncoupling but not beta-adrenergic receptor down regulation was involved in PMA-induced desensitization. Histamine had no effect on the beta-adrenergic system at all. The data suggest that the agonist-induced changes in the adenylate cyclase system are specifically located at the receptors, whereas PMA-induced refractoriness can be explained by alterations distal to the receptors, presumably at the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Thus, enhanced levels of catecholamines or histamine could be involved in the development of receptor-specific changes in the lymphocyte adenylate cyclase system of allergic patients with asthma. However, they are unlikely to cause the nonspecific changes distal to the receptors. The latter changes could be induced by physiologic activation of protein kinase C during the allergic response by a still unknown stimulus, possibly via the receptor-mediated turnover of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate.\r"

  ".U": "87309427\r", 
  ".W": "Leukotriene (LT) D4 is a potent constrictor of human airways and a putative mediator of asthma. However, its mechanism of action in man has not been established. In the present study we sought to determine the role of upper airway reflexes, cholinergic pathways, and cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism in mediating LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction in man. Six normal subjects underwent bronchoprovocation testing with LTD4 after pretreatment with either aerosolized phosphate-buffered saline, aerosolized atropine (1.5 mg), aerosolized lidocaine (80 to 160 mg), or oral indomethacin (50 mg three times daily for 10 doses). Specific airway conductance (SGaw), the flow rate at 30% of vital capacity from a partial forced expiratory maneuver (V30P), and the FEV1 were measured at each concentration of LTD4. We calculated the provocative concentration of LTD4 required to produce a 35% fall in SGaw (PC35SGaw) or a 30% fall in V30P (PC30V30P) and the slope of the LTD4 dose-response curve. Atropine increased baseline SGaw 49% (p less than 0.01) and V30P 43% (p less than 0.005). Atropine also increased the PC35SGaw and PC30V30P and increased the slope of the LTD4 dose-response curve. However, neither of these opposing effects was significant. Lidocaine had no effect on either baseline function or the airway response to LTD4. Indomethacin produced small decreases in baseline V30P (12%) and FEV1 (3%) (p less than 0.05 for both), but it too had no effect on the airway response to LTD4. These results indicate that the bronchoconstriction produced by aerosolized LTD4 in normal subjects is not mediated by cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism or irritant receptors in the upper airways. Although cholinergic pathways may play some role, the data suggest that bronchoconstriction results, at least in part, from a direct effect of LTD4 on airway smooth muscle.\r"

The \"epidemic\" of asthma deaths of the 1960s was not observed. Since 1968, it appears that asthma deaths decreased until 1974 for females and until 1980 for males, and then increased up to 2.9/100,000 in males and 3.6/100,000 for females. In the age group 5 to 34 years, there is a slight increase of deaths caused by asthma with a death rate of 0.35/100,000 in males and 0.39/100,000 in females. The ninth revision of the ICD did not lead to an increase in the number of reported deaths caused by asthma. In Denmark, death rates in the age group 5 to 34 years are similar to those in France, but in Germany they are much greater in number, and a clear increase was noticed. The causes of death of individuals with asthma in France are similar to causes reported in other countries, but deaths caused by specific immunotherapy may be more frequent because asthma is often treated by this form of therapy. Moreover, some deaths were associated with \"corticophobia,\" with many patients preferring to use homeopathy or acupuncture.\r"

Evidence exists that eosinophil degranulation commonly occurs during bronchial asthma and eosinophil granule proteins are discharged onto damaged bronchial epithelium. Analyses of 10 patients with fatal asthma showed striking eosinophil participation in eight, whereas two patients showed marked epithelial desquamation in the virtual absence of eosinophils. These results point to the possibility that a pathologic heterogeneity exists in fatal bronchial asthma, with most, but not all, patients showing evidence of eosinophil participation.\r"

  ".U": "87309450\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence from pediatric tertiary care centers in the United States that childhood deaths from asthma in hospitalized patients are becoming increasingly rare, while asthma mortality outside the hospital appears to be on the rise. When a young outpatient with asthma dies, the event is apt to be sudden and unanticipated and the victim is likely to be a preadolescent or adolescent who has suffered from asthma most of his or her life and who, despite ongoing bronchodilator therapy, requires hospitalizations for treatment of status asthmaticus. Patients in this age cohort have a strong tendency to underuse, overuse, or neglect to use prescribed medications, possibly as a gesture of emerging independence or because of the depression engendered by a chronic illness. In some instances serious psychosocial pathology accounts for noncompliance. For a patient with chronic asthma with a high-risk profile, any departure from an ongoing treatment regimen may result in respiratory failure. Pathologic complications of asthma may also act to upset the precarious physiologic equilibrium these patients have established. Unsuspected chronic pneumonia may lead to further increases in a chronically high degree of oxygen desaturation. Hypoxic seizures during an asthma attack may precipitate pulmonary edema. Tension pneumothorax has an even greater fatality potential for high-risk patients with asthma than it has for other patients with asthma, and pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale may develop because of chronic hypoxia. Some sudden deaths in children with chronic, severe asthma are unassociated with any of the above, making it necessary to entertain still other hypotheses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unless ways can be found to overcome the medical and reimbursement barriers, asthma self-management programs will not thrive. The growing number of individuals enrolled in some form of health maintenance organization, however, suggests a greater market for asthma self-management programs, under circumstances in which the costs of emergency room use and hospital services must be borne by physicians and hospitals, rather than by their patients.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary fiber's role in the prevention and treatment of constipation has long been known, but now fiber is touted as a cure for many of the ills in Western countries. Although some data exist to relate dietary fiber intake to certain diseases, lack of agreement on what dietary fiber is and how it should be measured make interpreting the data difficult. Further, not all dietary fiber is created equal. Water-soluble fibers, such as pectin and gums, have little effect on stool weight and hence are not appropriate treatment for patients with constipation. Water-insoluble fibers, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, are most effective in aiding laxation but may also limit absorption of minerals and possibly vitamins. Wheat bran is a good source of hemicellulose; vegetables supply cellulose to the diet. Most agencies are recommending a doubling or tripling of dietary fiber intake. Typical recommendations are set at 25 to 50 grams of dietary fiber daily. Different analytical methods for dietary fiber yield conflicting fiber values, and dietary fiber values do not exist for many foods, making fiber recommendations controversial and difficult to achieve. Fiber in the diet should ideally be increased by the consumption of unrefined breads and cereals and more fruits and vegetables. Vegetarians routinely consume 40 to 50 gm dietary fiber daily without ill effect. Fiber supplements may be appropriate for some patients, but the composition of the fiber should be known and be appropriate for the disease being treated. Before fiber supplements are marketed, clinical trials should be conducted to support the use of the supplements in the prevention and treatment of disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dietary fiber has proved effective in decreasing symptoms of diverticular disease, Crohn's disease, and hemorrhoids in a limited number of small clinical studies. Fiber may also reduce the incidence of gallstone formation. Fiber is currently being touted as protection against colon cancer. However, the epidemiological and experimental data do not provide convincing evidence that fiber alone is a major determinant of risk for colon cancer. Furthermore, the data from international comparisons indicating that fiber is protective against colon cancer can be used in a similar simplistic manner to suggest that fiber may be a risk factor for stomach cancer. This should not dissuade individuals from obtaining adequate fiber from a wide variety of foods but should caution them against consumption of excessive amounts of fiber from a single source or from dietary supplements.\r"

Five criteria are assessed: consistency of the association, strength of the association, specificity of the hypothesis, temporal relationship of the association, and coherence of the association. Forty epidemiological studies, described in 55 original reports, are analyzed in terms of an association between fiber intake and colon cancer. This evaluation clearly suggests a relationship between colon cancer and diet low in fiber. The epidemiological studies focus on dietary patterns in which fiber usually occurs as a complex mixture with other foods. At present, information on the chemistry and function of various types of fiber as well as the mechanisms of cancer inhibition still is quite limited. As dietary fiber may interact with or be linked to other dietary factors, the impact of total diet and dietary interactions should be considered in studies of colon cancer risk and in dietary counseling.\r"

Participants were 39 women and 107 men (aged 28 to 63 years) who were in year 4 or 5 post-treatment. These represented 95% of participants who had completed all annual clinic visits. Self-reported body weights obtained by telephone interview were validated against weight measured directly in a university clinic. Overall, self-reported weight was 5.9 lb (2.7 kg) (standard deviation = 7.0 lb) (2.9%) lower than the measured weight. Using regression analysis, the strongest predictor of measured weight was reported weight, for both men and women. The bias in self-report of weight seen here is of about the same magnitude and direction as that seen in population studies. We conclude that the use of self-reported weight is not adequate for the assessment of long-term weight-loss maintenance unless the magnitude of discrepancy is adjusted for.\r"

Of the three, cooperation is the only instructional strategy congruent with the goals of nutrition education. The essential elements of cooperative learning and the specific actions teachers need to take to implement it are presented. When cooperative learning is implemented effectively, long-term modifications of nutrition knowledge, attitudes and behavior result. Nutrition education classes will more successfully fulfill their purposes when cooperative learning is primarily used.\r"

  ".W": "The marketing paradigm is based on the premise of exchange of value, that is, value received for value given. The role of the nutrition educator as a marketer is to facilitate exchanges of value with consumers. To carry out this role, a strong orientation to the consumer, what she or he wants and needs and is willing to \"pay,\" guides the development of the nutrition education mission, objectives, and strategies. The marketing paradigm calls for a marketing information system that includes internal record keeping, marketing intelligence gathering, and marketing research. The information is used in the marketing audit, which identifies organizational strengths and weaknesses and marketplace opportunities and barriers. Marketing objectives are formulated, and strategies for segmenting, positioning, and developing the marketing mix follow. These are translated in the marketing plan to an action plan, a budget, and profit and loss projections. Use of the marketing paradigm in nutrition education is not a panacea for organizational ills and marketplace problems. Instead, the paradigm raises issues to which nutrition educators must bring their expertise, commitment, ingenuity, and creativity.\r"

  ".W": "Two types of follicular change in the thyroid are described. The first represents an involutional change in which colloid cysts (macrofollicles) are often found. The second represents a hyperplastic-dysplastic (microfollicular) lesion. Two types of change in calcitonin (C) cells are also described, one of which may represent an involutional process, although this is not certain. The second is a hyperplastic (micronodular) lesion, but without evidence of dysplasia. An infiltration of lymphocytes is also commonly encountered. Only about 15% of cases after age 60 are free of the follicular and lymphoid lesions. Both the macro- and microfollicular lesions show a statistically significant increase with age, as do the lymphoid lesion and its derivative Hashimoto's thyroiditis. C cell micronodules also appear to increase with age, but there are too few such cases for a reliable statistical analysis. An analysis of combinations of the follicular and lymphoid lesions show a particularly frequent association of the microfollicular and lymphoid lesions. Evidence is presented suggesting that many microfollicular lesions may represent clones of mutated cells, and that the lymphocytes may be targeted to these microfollicles. Lymphocytes were rarely found in association with C cell micronodules. Within individual thyroids there is considerable variation in the proportion of each lesion when combinations are present. Thus with advancing age there is an increasing heterogeneity of thyroid structure that may confound attempts to correlate structural and physiological changes with age.\r"

Involuting and macro- (cystic) follicles show a decline in hormone content with age, while microfollicles show a variable pattern with some showing a high and others a low content, as well as some showing an absence of hormone. There also appears to be an increase with age in hormone-containing C cell micronodules, but we were unable to demonstrate a decline in hormone content of individual C cells. Studies on the in vivo binding of immunoglobulins, as an indicator of thyroid antibody binding, showed an increase with age in IgG and IgM binding to follicular epithelium. Much stronger reactions were observed in the epithelium of microfollicles than in that of involuting or macrofollicles. There were also examples of presumptive in vivo antibody binding by C cell micronodules. We were unable to demonstrate an imbalance of helper/suppressor T cell ratio in the thyroiditis lesion, but did find that some lymphocytes contain thyroid hormones, suggesting that the latter may act as cytokines and assist in the perpetuation of the lesion. The epithelial expression of human lymphocyte antigens (HLA) was strong in microfollicles and weak or absent in involuting or macrofollicles in sections with lymphocytic thyroiditis. It was also strong in the epithelium of a microfollicular adenoma without a lymphocytic infiltrate while weak or absent in the epithelium of adjacent normal follicles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One way to address this problem is through routine use of screening instruments, but up to this time, none of the instruments used to identify alcoholism in younger populations have been shown to be valid in the elderly. We studied the validity of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, scored both with weighted (MAST) and unit scoring (UMAST), and two short versions: the Brief MAST (BMAST) and Short MAST (SMAST) in 52 hospitalized elderly male alcoholics and 33 nonalcoholic controls. The MAST and UMAST showed excellent sensitivity and specificity, while the SMAST was less specific, and the BMAST less sensitive and less specific. Factor structure of the two brief versions was similar to that found in younger alcoholics, suggesting that symptom constellation is not necessarily different in the elderly. We recommend the use of the MAST or UMAST for screening for alcoholism in the elderly.\r"

Conflicting recommendations exist concerning the screening of women over the age of 65, and little information is available concerning the results of screening in this population. Elderly women are routinely omitted from screening, as it is generally believed that they usually refuse testing. This paper reports a study attempting to evaluate the feasibility of screening in women over the age of 64 attending a large urban outpatient geriatric clinic. It demonstrates that pap smear screening is acceptable to this population, particularly if performed by the usual primary care provider. It also confirms previous reports that women in this age group have had very little screening in the past, and that screening uncovers a large number of abnormalities. Of note is the high rate of false positive smears in this population.\r"

However, these alterations were not observed if data were expressed as mg antimicrobial protein/g total protein. Also, no change was detected in an acinar cell exocrine product, the anionic proline-rich proteins, as reported previously by our laboratory.

In old animals, Nv and Sv were significantly reduced, whereas S was significantly increased as compared with the values in adult rats. Hydergine (Codergocrine mesylate) treatment of old animals (3 mg/Kg/day for 4 weeks) influenced these three parameters, differentially. The Sv in aged animals receiving Hydergine, relative to that in untreated old rats, was significantly increased; the number and size of synapses in the treated old rats were significantly higher and smaller, respectively, than that in old controls.

We then determined gluconeogenic intermediates in the liver. In the old rats with peritonitis, hexosemonophosphates (HMP) increased 50% relative to control liver, whereas in the young animals with peritonitis, the substrate decreased 50%. The accumulation of HMP in the old rat liver cells indicates a failure to dephosphorylate glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). This increase in HMP is associated with a decline in hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the final enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway, and is reflected in a significant reduction in serum glucose in old Fischer 344 rats when compared to young Fischer rats.\r"

However, no age difference was found in controllability of the outcome. Domain-specific measures were better predictors of coping than generalized measures of locus of control. Domain-specific attribution measures were most predictive of the coping mechanism self-blame, and this relation was moderated by age and context. Controllability of outcome predicted the use of self-blame among adolescents and, to a lesser degree, among younger adults; internal locus of causality of the stressful event predicted self-blame among older adults.\r"

Participants in both age groups altered their processing of the actions, as indicated by reading times and trait ratings, relative to the sex role emphasized, although the effect was stronger for men than women. The expected greater recall for sex role inconsistent than consistent actions was observed only when the traditional sex role was emphasized, and not when the nontraditional role was emphasized, suggesting interference from the dominant schema at recall. However, the lack of age differences in the degree of interference observed during initial processing and recall suggests no aging effects on schematic flexibility.\r"

The respondents were asked questions of the structural (e.g., age, sex, closeness, years known, proximity, and frequency of contact) and functional (number and type of supports provided and received) characteristics of their social networks. These characteristics and relationships are described in detail.\r"

This article discusses the measurement of health with the understanding that health indicators vary in their degree of objectivity/subjectivity and examines the double jeopardy thesis with data from a national sample of older adults. The results indicate that older Blacks tend to have poorer health, as judged by perceived health and disability, than older Whites. However, there is no evidence that the health differential between elderly Whites and elderly Blacks varies with age; the results do not support the double jeopardy hypothesis. The analysis also illustrates ways to assess the difference of effects in a multivariate model applied to more than one group.\r"

Central cities and suburbs of metropolitan areas (SMSAs) and nonmetropolitan areas (NonSMSAs) were distinguished as origins and destinations. Most elderly movers relocated within a fairly limited geographic context and revealed strong preferences for metropolitan living. Suburban locations were more favored than central city locations. Net migration findings may provide misleading interpretations of older movers' locational choices. The migration patterns of the 65 + population were similar to those of the 45- to 64-year-old population but differed from those of the more youthful U.S. populations. These findings highlight migration streams of elderly movers who likely have experienced changed in their life styles or personal resources.\r"

Compared to the younger cohort, the elderly cohort demonstrated more presenting symptoms of dyspnea, fewer symptoms of chest pain but a similar frequency of weight loss as a presenting sign. The elderly cohort contained more chronic, comorbid diseases but demonstrated more localized cancer and less metastatic disease compared to the younger cohorts. More than 80% of both groups did not undergo surgical resection. We conclude that elderly patients may be a relevant subgroup of lung cancer patients who must be included in studies of new strategies for disease detection, treatment, and management, and the identification of biological characteristics that could further define this high-risk subset of cancer patients.\r"

The study randomized 551 men and women over the age of 60 (mean age = 72 years) to a stepped care treatment that included chlorthalidone or placebo in a double-blind trial. Three measures of compliance to treatment protocol--pill count, self-report, and a urine chlorthalidone assay--all indicated high levels of compliance in 80 to 90% of participants at 3 months and 1 year after randomization. Pill-taking compliance was similar in the active and placebo groups, although the rate of discontinuance from study medications at 1 year was higher in the placebo than in the active group. Compliance was high in all age categories, including those over age 80. These data suggest that elderly patients can achieve high levels of compliance with antihypertensive medications.\r"

Current methods of controlling hazardous ambulation usually involve restraint, medication, locked doors, or physical intervention. Capitalizing on the observation that many demented individuals perceive two-dimensional patterns as barriers, we laid out masking tape in different grid patterns in an attempt to prevent ambulation through exit doors. The baseline condition (no tape) yielded a 98% exit-door contact for 8 demented male patients, but the addition of horizontal grids reduced exit-door contact to 42%. Often, complete prevention occurred at the first experimental trial. Advantages and cautions inherent in this approach to managing wandering by demented patients are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of famotidine, a new potent H2-receptor antagonist, has been studied in 1,031 patients by 68 investigators in 19 countries in a worldwide dose-ranging multicenter comparative study. Three doses of famotidine (40 mg h.s., 20 mg b.i.d., 40 mg b.i.d.) were compared to ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. There were no significant differences between the groups in baseline characteristics, including duodenal ulcer size. Efficacy parameters included daytime and nocturnal symptom relief and duodenal ulcer healing, documented by endoscopy, and defined as complete re-epithelialization of the ulcer crater. Significant reductions from baseline for day and night pain, beginning during the first 24 h period, were found in all four treatment groups (p less than 0.01). There was little difference among the four treatment groups with respect to the percentage of patients healed after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Healing rates for the three famotidine groups (40 mg h.s., 20 mg b.i.d., 40 mg b.i.d.) were 88, 92 and 92%, respectively, after 8 weeks of treatment as compared to 91% for the ranitidine group. The occurrence and type of adverse clinical experiences reported was similar for each of the four treatment groups. The most common adverse experiences were headache and diarrhea. The results of this study demonstrate that an h.s. dose of famotidine is equivalent to both b.i.d. famotidine and b.i.d. ranitidine in duodenal ulcer healing and pain relief. In view of possible increased patient compliance with a simplified dosage regimen, famotidine 40 mg h.s. is recommended in the acute treatment of duodenal ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred thirty-six patients with endoscopically diagnosed benign gastric ulcers, randomly allocated to treatment with 40 mg famotidine at night or placebo, were evaluated in a double-blind multicenter trial conducted in 14 countries worldwide. After 4 weeks, 294 patients qualified for a \"per protocol\" analysis. Complete ulcer healing was observed in 70 of 149 patients (47%) treated with famotidine 40 mg at night and in 45 of 145 patients (31%) receiving placebo. Cumulative healing rates at 6 weeks were 65 and 46%, and at 8 weeks 80 and 54%, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the healing rates at each time point (p less than 0.01). The famotidine treatment was significantly more effective at rapidly reducing the incidence of ulcer-related symptoms. Adverse side effects reported were minor and equally distributed between the two groups. The results of this trial show that 40 mg famotidine administered at night is significantly superior to placebo in both accelerating the healing of benign gastric ulcers and in relieving ulcer symptoms. Since 40 mg famotidine administered at night suppresses exclusively nocturnal acid secretion, these findings support the hypothesis that this factor is also of particular importance in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcers.\r"

Famotidine had a 30% longer duration of action than either ranitidine or cimetidine. The 32 patients were treated with famotidine for a mean follow-up of 10.5 months. No hematologic, biochemical, or clinical toxicity occurred. Famotidine appears to be the histamine H2-receptor antagonist of choice in the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\r"
