  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the excitability of corticospinal neurons and the integrity of their projections to the alpha motor neurons through the corticospinal tract in subjects of different ages with Rett syndrome. Electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex and cervical motor roots was used to evoke motor action potentials in the biceps brachii and hypothenar muscles. The phasic stretch reflex in the biceps brachii was also recorded to study the excitability of spinal alpha motor neurons. Motor cortex stimulation evoked motor action potentials at low threshold and with abnormally short latencies and prolonged durations. In contrast cervical motor root stimulation resulted in responses of normal latency and duration. The phasic stretch reflex had a low threshold, short latency and prolonged duration. It is concluded that in Rett syndrome the corticospinal pathway is intact. The results suggest disordered synaptic control of the Betz cell of the motor cortex and/or the spinal alpha motor neuron, although the involvement of the latter might be a consequence of dysfunction in supraspinal descending motor pathways.\r"

  ".W": "The electrical and contractile properties of hand muscles in a selected population of quadriplegic subjects were studied intensively before and after EMG biofeedback. Spontaneously active motor units and units that could only be slowly and weakly activated were observed in these subjects, in addition to units that were voluntarily activated normally. This suggests a considerable overlap of surviving motor neurons to a single muscle that are below, near or above the level of a lesion. Despite the common occurrence of polyphasic potentials and other signs of neuromuscular reinnervation, the average twitch tension of single motor units in hand muscles of quadriplegic subjects was not significantly different from that in control subjects. Nor did it increase after biofeedback training that typically increased the peak surface EMG by a factor of 2-5 times. The percentage of spontaneously active units was also constant. The surface EMG may be increased during biofeedback by using higher firing rates in motor units that can already be activated, rather than by recruiting previously unavailable motor units.\r"

Electrophysiological and morphological data were consistent with axonal damage, the larger myelinated fibres being most affected. Although active signs of vasculitis and immunoperoxidase staining for immunoglobulins were not present, endoneurial vessels were widely damaged, with abnormally thick endothelial cells and redundant basal membranes. These findings, together with a patchy distribution of myelinated fibre loss, suggest ischaemia as a cause of peripheral neuropathy during essential cryoglobulinaemia type II. A follow up examination, performed one year after haematologial remission, revealed that no further peripheral nerve damage had occurred.\r"

Transient abolition of the VEP was seen under many circumstances and did not correlate with the outcome of surgery, but absence of a previously normal VEP for more than four minutes during surgical manipulation within the orbit did show a correlation with post operative impairment of vision.

Neither was there an increase in mortality from motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), the control disease. Death rates from MS vary with social class, being highest in social class IIIN (skilled non-manual) and lowest in social class II (intermediate). These different rates may be due to MS causing health related occupational mobility. Allowance for the inter-class variability in MS death rates did not materially affect the conclusion that death from MS appears to be no more common than expected among nurses and doctors than in the general population. Possible explanations for the cluster of multiple sclerosis among nurses in Key West are discussed.\r"

Regardless of clinical diagnosis, patients with low HVA were slower on a test of efficiency of processing timed information, and showed greater benefit from semantic structure on a verbal fluency task than patients with high HVA. However, low HVA subjects were not significantly impaired on confrontation naming (Boston Naming Test). Across three diagnostic groups, patients with lower HVA also tended to have more extrapyramidal motor signs and were significantly more depressed. These results demonstrate a significant relationship between specific neuro-behavioural deficits and dopaminergic activity which cuts across traditional diagnostic categories.\r"

The prevalence of LEAD as measured by AAI increased with age in women and was associated with a history of current smoking and lower levels of high density lipoproteins. In this study population with systolic hypertension, LEAD, as measured by the AAI, is more prevalent than previously described in elderly populations and is associated with other risk factors for atherosclerosis.\r"

Birth cohort patterns were evident for all three sets of data. The results confirm a continuing increase in invasive breast cancer by providing evidence of a strong birth cohort pattern, over a time series of 90 years of birth cohorts. This trend appears to be real for the most part because of the cohort patterns and because there is minimal underdetection in data obtained by autopsy and blind biopsy. Secondly, when cohort modeling is applied to breast cancer mortality, there is an indication of a modest decline in recent breast cancer mortality (in the face of an apparent long-term increase), which suggests that control of breast cancer mortality may have developed in recent decades, perhaps through earlier detection and improved treatment. Finally, in contrast with a prior report, there is little evidence for a clinically important difference in time trend between pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer.\r"

British subjects (77 males, 41 females) provided details of their LTPA over a period of a \"typical\" 2 weeks, enabling the estimation of the energy expended. Physical fitness was assessed with a battery of measures, the optimal single measure being sub-maximal physical work capacity (PWC). The questionnaire showed LTPA to be stable following test-retest administration (r = 0.86; p less than 0.0001) for total LTPA energy expenditure. Total LTPA was found to be significantly related to PWC (r = 0.48, p less than 0.0001), as were very hard (r = 0.55; p less than 0.0001) and hard LTPA (r = 0.38; p less than 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis with PWC as the dependent variable yielded a multiple correlation of r = 0.87, with significant contributions from very hard and hard LTPA. It is concluded that whilst this questionnaire is both reliable and a valid estimate of physical fitness amongst a population consistent in their leisure-time physical activities, there is scope for its further use within larger populations, allowing for an analysis of the effects of age and gender on the associations so far observed.\r"

Sleep patterns were characterized according to demographic variables, clinical conditions, and physical, psychological, and social functioning. Sleep latency and total hours of sleep increased with age, and older respondents went to bed earlier. The percentage of respondents who reported feeling rested in the morning decreased with age. Women went to bed later, had longer sleep latency, and fewer hours of sleep than men, and were less likely to report feeling rested than men. Sleep patterns were also related to educational attainment, self-perceived health status, physical functional status, psychotropic drug use, alcohol use, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and social and recreational activity level. This population study suggests that sleep problems among the elderly are sometimes associated with treatable health conditions and modifiable behavioral and environmental characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "In a large, population based, epidemiological study of colorectal cancer, The Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study, several etiological factors were investigated. Persons' recent life changes, as well as the degree of upset they experienced as a result of these changes, were included. Interviews with 715 histologically confirmed new cases of colorectal cancer occurring over a 12-month period in Melbourne, Australia, and with 727 age and sex matched community controls were conducted. As one of the methods of assessing any effect of recall bias, 179 hospital controls were also investigated. Major illness or death of a family member, major family problems and major work problems were found to be significantly more common for cases over the 5 years preceding diagnosis compared to controls. Cases also reported being significantly more upset with their recent life changes than did controls. No significant differences in results were found between males and females, or between colon cancer and rectal cancer patients. Although the possibility of recall bias, was not completely controlled for in this study, it was probably not an important factor in explaining case-control differences. Recent life changes, and their perceptions, may have significance in the development of large bowel cancer.\r"

In this study, we examine the incidence of cancer (all sites) in two groups of families: (a) those ascertained through a patient with primary lung cancer (n = 359 families) and (b) through a community control subject (n = 234). The index subjects were excluded from all incidence data analyses. Most families (62 vs 57%) reported at least one member with a history of neoplastic disease. Patients' families were more likely to have 2 or more affected members (p less than 0.05), to exhibit a multigenerational pattern (33 vs 24%) and to have a higher risk of multiple tumours (OR = 1.5) in the same individual. However, most of the sites with the highest odds ratios (males, vocal cord/esophagus 8.3; colon/rectum 2.3; lung 1.96; females, pancreas 4.8; vocal/cord esophagus 4.1; lung 1.8) are smoking associated although these were not necessarily the most frequently affected sites. In conclusion, these data support an ecogenetic etiology of cancer within families.\r"

Key results are: (1) omitting mavericks biases odds ratios towards 1; (2) omitting mavericks cannot artificially introduce an effect in contrast to omitting classical confounders; (3) the operational criterion for confounding corresponds to the conditional criterion when estimating odds ratios, but for relative risks, there are no mavericks (i.e. the classical and operational criterion correspond); and (4) the interpretation of odds ratios obtained from standard methods is that of comparing proportions, not of individual risk.\r"

We enrolled the patients from 37 dialysis facilities in two southeastern states (n = 294). Functional status was assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and quality of life by the Spitzer Quality of Life Index (SQLI). During a mean (SE) follow-up of 479.6 (109.4) days 49 patients (16.4%) of the cohort died. The mean KPS score (SE) for survivors was 7.31 (0.11) and for non-survivors was 5.89 (0.26), P less than 0.0001. The mean SQLI score (SE) for survivors was 6.74 (0.15) and non-survivors was 4.95 (0.28), P less than 0.0001. Strong gradients of the risk of mortality were found for both measurements. After controlling for other covariates including age, race, sex, primary cause of renal failure and the presence of comorbidity, both the KPS and SQLI scores were independently correlated with risk of mortality. We conclude that functional status and quality of life are strong independent risk factors for subsequent mortality in new dialysis patients. These are easily measured indicators which may serve to predict subsequent risk of mortality or adjust case-mix estimates for comparisons between dialysis populations.\r"

Agreement was measured among nine judges, each of whom assessed the scientific quality of 36 published review articles. ITEM SELECTION. An iterative process was used to select ten criteria relative to five key tasks entailed in conducting a research overview. SAMPLE. The review articles were drawn from three sampling frames: articles highly rated by criteria external to the study; meta-analyses; and a broad spectrum of medical journals. JUDGES. Three categories of judges were used: research assistants; clinicians with research training; and experts in research methodology; with three judges in each category. RESULTS. The level of agreement within the three groups of judges was similar for their overall assessment of scientific quality and for six of the nine other items. With four exceptions, agreement among judges within each group and across groups, as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), was greater than 0.5, and 60% (24/40) of the ICCs were greater than 0.7. CONCLUSIONS. It was possible to achieve reasonable to excellent agreement for all of the items in the index, including the overall assessment of scientific quality. The implications of these results for practising clinicians and the peer review system are discussed.\r"

Symmetrical lacrimal gland and parotid gland 67Ga uptake (panda appearance) was noted in 79% of sarcoidosis patients. A simultaneous lambda and panda pattern (62%) or a panda appearance with radiographic bilateral, symmetrical, hilar lymphadenopathy (6%) was present only in sarcoidosis patients. The presence of either of these patterns was particularly prevalent in roentgen Stages I (80%) or II (74%). We conclude that simultaneous (a) lambda and panda images, or (b) a panda image with bilateral symmetrical hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray represent distinctive patterns which are highly specific for sarcoidosis, and may obviate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures.\r"

Cholescintigraphic patterns of perforation associated with the Niemeier classification were: Type I (acute free perforation), 3 of 7 scans demonstrated free spill; Type II (subacute pericholecystic abscess), 9 of 19 scans showed pericholecystic activity; and Type III (chronic cholecystoenteric fistula), 1 of 3 scans showed a scintigraphic gallstone ileus. Thus, although cholescintigraphy appears superior to sonography, both modalities are relatively insensitive for the detection of gallbladder perforation.\r"

Mean tumor/muscle radioactivity ratios are 5.3 +/- 2.0 (n = 14) for malignant and 1.9 +/- 0.9 (n = 10) for benign with MET (p less than 0.001), and 4.4 +/- 2.2 (n = 12) and 1.5 +/- 0.3 (n = 10), respectively, with FDG (p less than 0.001). The ratios indicate that malignant tumors have higher metabolic demand than benign lesions. Tumors less than 1 cm in diameter were difficult to accurately evaluate due to PET resolution. Compared to the diagnosis at pathology, the MET study showed a sensitivity of 93% (13/14), a specificity of 60% (6/10), and an accuracy of 79% (19/24). The FDG study showed 83% (10/12), 90% (9/10), 86% (19/22), respectively. No significant differences were observed between the two tracers. This study suggests that PET studies using either MET or FDG may be very useful for the differential diagnosis of lung tumors.\r"

In 95 cases, radionuclide ventriculography was performed within 24 hr of myocardial biopsy. A reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction to less than 50% was significantly more common with moderate-severe rejection than with mild rejection. In six instances in which there was discordance between ventriculography and biopsy, radionuclide ventriculography proved particularly useful: three cases showed severe left ventricular dysfunction despite only mild rejection by biopsy, and three cases with ventricular dysfunction from rejection were missed by the initial biopsy. Thus, radionuclide ventriculography can provide functional data in transplant patients that is complementary to myocardial biopsies since biopsy grade is a poor predictor of left ventricular function and biopsy can miss significant rejection.\r"

The in vivo, in vitro correlation of 131I concentrations in the urine was also good (r = 0.98, s.e.e. = 0.677 microCi/cc). Quantitative SPECT was used to calculate the effective half-life and dosimetry of radioiodine in 12 sites of thyroid carcinoma in seven patients. SPECT was also used to determine the dosimetry of [131I]MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) in two patients with carcinoid, two with neuroblastoma, and one with pheochromocytoma. The radiation dose for thyroid carcinoma metastases varied between 6.3 and 276.9 rad/mCi. The dose from MIBG varied between 13.4 and 57.8 rad/mCi. These results indicate the validity of quantitative SPECT for in vivo measurement of 131I and the need to measure the concentration of 131I in individual human tumor sites.\r"

Though present in all 23 infected arthroplasties, periprosthetic activity was also present in 77% of uninfected arthroplasties, and was greater than the contralateral zone 51% of the time. When analyzed by zone, head zone activity was the best criterion for infection (87% sensitivity, 94% specificity, 92% accuracy). Fifty of the arthroplasties were studied with combined labeled leukocyte/sulfur colloid imaging. Using incongruence of images as the criterion for infection, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the study were 100%, 97%, and 98%, respectively. While variable periprosthetic activity makes labeled leukocyte imaging alone unreliable for diagnosing hip arthroplasty infection, the addition of sulfur colloid imaging results in a highly accurate diagnostic procedure.\r"

  ".U": "91093770\r", 
  ".W": "Thyroid carcinoma has the ability to concentrate radioiodine, an attribute that can be used both for detection of thyroid cells and for treatment. Unfortunately, however, radioiodine uptake is not observed in all patients and a radioiodine scan requires that the patient be rendered hypothyroid for 4-6 wk. In the present study, we analyzed the utility of thallium-201 scanning and the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of thyroid cancer. Nineteen patients with thyroid cancer had a total of 24 radioiodine scans, 33 thallium scans, and 10 MRI examinations. Of the 19 patients in the study, 17 had differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In these 17 cases, all paired studies were concordant for the presence (n = 7) or absence (n = 10) of disease. However, in one case (Patient 10), the 201Tl studies showed far more extensive disease than was observed on the 131I scan. Thyroid cancer was also detected on seven MRI studies. In summary, thallium and MRI scans are adjunctive techniques to radioiodine scanning that can either confirm the presence of neck bed activity, residual disease or metastatic cancer and may delineate tumor deposits not detected by radioiodine scanning. Thallium may be capable of detecting tumor deposits even while a patient remains euthyroid.\r"

Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was quantified by means of a heart-to-lung ratio (HLR). Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was observed in 17/20 (85%) patients, and HLR after chemotherapy was 1.86 +/- 0.25. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was determined before and after chemotherapy. Patients with decreased EF (8/20, 40%) presented with more intense antimyosin uptake (HLR of 2.11 +/- 0.10 versus 1.70 +/- 0.16 (p = 0.01]. HLR values correlated with EF values after chemotherapy (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05). Positive antimyosin studies after chemotherapy including doxorubicin, indicate the presence of myocardial damage in these patients. Antimyosin studies are a sensitive method to detect myocyte damage in patients after doxorubicin therapy.\r"

The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency and causes of 111In MAb localization in tumor-free, benign tissues. Thus, scans of 75 patients who have undergone exploratory surgery following radioimmunoscintigraphy with 111In-ZCE 025 (n = 37) or 111In-CYT-103 (n = 38) were reviewed in conjunction with operative and histopathology reports. Localization in non-tumored tissues was seen in 10.8% and 13.1%, respectively, of patients receiving ZCE 025 and CYT-103. The most common sites involved were: degenerative joint disease, abdominal aneurysms, postoperative bowel adhesions, and local inflammatory changes secondary to surgery or external irradiation. Review of patients' medical history and results of concurrent diagnostic modalities is likely to lessen the false-positive rate of 111In-labeled MAb scan interpretation.\r"

In a population of 32 hypertensive patients, RAS was present in 23 of 62 kidneys. Eleven of the 32 patients underwent renal revascularization, of whom 6 showed improvement in blood pressure control at 6 mo, i.e., had renovascular hypertension (RVH). There was no correlation between RBF and angiographic appearances of the renal artery. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between RBF in the stenosed kidneys of the patients with RVH compared with the stenosed kidneys of patients without RVH. Individual kidney RBF was 22% (s.d. 11) higher 1-3 wk after PTRA but the increase did not correlate with clinical outcome. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition increased RBF by 25% (s.d. 25) of baseline flow before PTRA but the increase did not correlate with clinical outcome. Measurement of RBF is of limited value for the prediction of the long-term blood pressure response following PTRA.\r"

The zinc-62/copper-62 radionuclide generator system could serve as a source of positron-emitting copper-62 (62Cu) (t1/2 = 9.74 min) for physiologic imaging. Accordingly, we have prepared zinc-62/copper-62 generators capable of high output (greater than 300 mCi) and used the no-carrier-added eluate in a rapid high yield synthesis of [62Cu] Cu(PTSM) that provides the radiopharmaceutical in a form suitable for intravenous injection (where Cu(PTSM) = pyruvaldehyde bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazonato) copper(II]. We then demonstrated in pilot studies that [62Cu]Cu(PTSM) provides high quality brain and heart images with PET, accurately delineating cerebral and myocardial perfusion in both experimental animals and in humans (corroborating results of previous experimental studies utilizing longer-lived copper isotopes). The results of this work demonstrate that 62Cu can be conveniently obtained from high-level generators and, when used to label Cu(PTSM), provides a generator-produced radiopharmaceutical capable of providing estimates of cerebral and myocardial perfusion independent of cyclotron-produced radionuclides.\r"

Using the tissue sampling method with five tumor models, different time-radioactivity profiles were found: a nearly constant level in Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) and different clearance patterns in others. Rapid clearance in normal tissues resulted in preferable uptake ratios for tumor imaging of brain and pancreas. Metabolic studies and the L-fucose loading effects on the tissue uptake proved the tracer to be a biochemically active L-fucose analog. Imaging of the intracranial rat glioma and 3LL in lungs or hepatomas in mice by autoradiography (ARG) and intramuscular VX-2 carcinoma in rabbits by PET was demonstrated. Using double-radionuclide ARG, similar distribution images of 6-[18F]FFuc and 14C-L-fucose but different tumor-to-liver uptake ratios were found. A metastasis model seemed to show a higher uptake of both tracers as compared to a primary tumor model.\r"

Transport of this anion is inhibited after incubation at low temperature, indicating the involvement of a process with high activation energy. Transport is also decreased by two well-known inhibitors of the band-3 anion transport system and is not affected by inhibition of the Na/K/Cl co-transport system. From these results we conclude that, in the process of labeling red blood cells with 99mTc, the pertechnetate anion may reach the interior of the erythrocyte through the band-3 anion transport system.\r"

Uptake of 99mTc-labeled phosphate was studied in an animal model of primary osteogenesis following tibial marrow injury and incorporation was correlated to that of calcium-47 (47Ca), phosphorus-32 (32P), and with matrix vesicle calcification. Isotope uptake on Day 6 in the whole bone was increased compared to controls. On this day, an increase in vesicular diameter and distance from the calcified front was previously observed. Technetium-99m-labeled phosphates were detected only in the organic phase. Phosphorus-32 and 47Ca were detected in both organic and inorganic phases. It is suggested that 99mTc serves as a specific marker to the anabolic phase of remodeling. Increased incorporation of 99mTc during bone healing indicates enhanced organic matrix formation and not calcification.\r"

Kinetic studies in the dopamine D2 receptor-rich striatum showed that 11C-NMB was retained five times longer than in receptor-devoid regions, resulting in a high maximum striatal-to-cerebellar ratio of 11:1 at 60 min after injection. From frontal cortex and cortex, on the other hand, the tracer washed out as rapidly as it did from cerebellum, resulting in tissue-to-cerebellar ratios close to one in these regions at any time after injection. Blocking studies confirmed the specificity and selectivity of the 11C-NMB binding to the dopamine D2 receptor. A PET study with 11C-NMB of the baboon brain revealed highly selective labeling of dopamine D2 receptor sites which was blocked by preinjection of raclopride.\r"

Technetium-99m- and indium-111-IgG were co-administered to normal rats and biodistribution was determined at 2, 6, and 16 hr. The inflammation imaging properties of the two reagents were compared in rats with deep-thigh infection due to Escherichia coli. Blood clearance of both antibody preparations was well described by a bi-exponential function: (99mTc-IgG: t1/2 = 3.82 +/- 0.89 and 57.52 +/- 1.70 hr. 111In-IgG: 3.93 +/- 0.117 and 40.71 +/- 1.26 hr). Biodistributions in the solid organs were similar, however, small but statistically significant differences were detected: 99mTc-IgG greater than 111In-IgG in lung, liver, and spleen; 99mTc-IgG less than 111In-IgG in kidney and skeletal muscle (p less than 0.01). At all three imaging times, target-to-background ratio and percent residual activity for the two compounds were remarkably similar. These studies establish that human polyclonal IgG labeled with 99mTc via a nicotinyl hydrazine modified intermediate is equivalent to 111In-IgG for imaging focal sites of infection in experimental animals.\r"

A 5-yr-old female patient with a brain stem astrocytoma showed marked focal uptake of 99mTc-Hexamibi at the site of tumor recurrence as defined by biopsy and prior 201TI/SPECT study. Tumor-to-normal cortex radioactivity ratios for the 99mTc-Hexamibi/SPECT study were 132:1 and the spatial resolution of the 99mTc-Hexamibi images was high.

By using an in vivo cross-matching method, we demonstrated that this anti-Gerbich did not cause RBC destruction. Regular Gerbich-positive transfusions could then proceed without hemolysis. This cross-match test was based on the determination of the urinary excretion rates of injected radioactive chromium-labeled donor erythrocytes by which it was possible to determine compatibility only 24 hr after the test was begun.

A study was performed to determine normal ranges for HMPAO uptake in the ROIs defined by the model, and to assess the relative interobserver variability using the fitting program. HMPAO SPECT studies of twelve normal volunteers were independently analyzed by four observers. Small but significant differences between operators occurred primarily because of difficulty in defining the angle of the orbitomeatal plane on sagittal SPECT images. Despite this difficulty, the program and model have proven useful in defining ranges for normal cerebral perfusion in a healthy adult population.

The indications and effects of misalignment were assessed in eight subjects from a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study on the effects of cocaine on regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose. Visual examination of a difference image provided a sensitive and accurate tool for assessing image alignment. Image alignment within 2.8 mm was essential to reduce variability of measured cerebral metabolic rates for glucose. Misalignment by this amount introduced errors on the order of 20% in the computed metabolic rate for glucose. These errors propagate to the difference between metabolic rates for a subject measured in basal versus perturbed states.\r"

  ".W": "A detection system based on microchannel plates has been constructed to image charged particles emitted by radionuclides in biomedical samples. This technique has significant advantages over conventional film autoradiography for investigating the distribution of radiolabeled compounds: shorter acquisition times due to the high sensitivity, easier sample handling, direct quantification and the ability to perform dynamic studies. The detector performance shows a spatial resolution of 0.9 mm for carbon-14 (14C) (0.156 MeV), good linearity and homogeneity. The noise level is below 50/(cm2.sec). Successful imaging with this system has been performed with beta-emitters 14C, sulfur-35 (35S), iodine-131 (131I), yttrium-90 (90Y), and positron emitters gallium-68 (68Ga), and fluorine-18 (18F). Dynamic studies of axonal transport of 35S-methionine in a nerve, and static images of 90Y-labeled monoclonal antibodies in slices of tumors are presented. The system shows promise for rapid quantitative imaging of charged-particle emitting radionuclides in small biologic samples.\r"

Studies can be difficult to interpret from transaxial images, and the temporal changes in tissue tracer concentrations which permit quantitative determinations of metabolism and perfusion are not displayed. We have developed a method to give quantitatively accurate three-dimensional images of myocardial oxygen consumption from serial images of the myocardial washout of carbon-11-acetate. Following i.v. bolus injection, data are collected for 20-30 min. The time-activity curves for each pixel in the transaxial slices are fit to a monoexponential function to determine the washout rate, which is directly related to the rate of myocardial oxygen utilization. Thus, functional images of myocardial oxygen consumption are produced for all seven slices of PET data. A previously developed method is then used to generate realistic and quantitatively accurate three-dimensional images.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES: To describe a medical center policy designed to contain the cost of using the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin in a primary care setting, to examine the effect of the policy on cost containment, and to examine physician acceptance of the policy. SETTING: A Veterans Affairs medical center. INTERVENTIONS: The policy made lovastatin available to physicians when failure of therapy with diet and two first-line drugs was documented on an order form. The form also contained educational information including prices and recommended niacin as the drug treatment of first choice for most patients. DESIGN: To evaluate the effect of the policy, lipid-lowering drug use at the medical center was compared with that at a similar center that did not restrict lovastatin use, and with lipid-lowering drug use in the United States as a whole. A written questionnaire was used to survey physician reaction to the policy. RESULTS: The use of lovastatin as a percentage of total lipid-lowering drug use at the center with the lovastatin policy was one-fourth that at the other center or nationwide, and the use of niacin was four times greater (p less than 0.0001). The estimated savings in drug costs to the center with the lovastatin policy due to these differences was more than $30,000 per year. In the survey of physicians affected by the policy (n = 78, response rate = 100%), less than one-fourth viewed it unfavorably, and 90% favored this policy over restricting the drug to a subspecialty clinic. CONCLUSION: The authors' experience indicates that a formulary policy that permits limited use of an expensive drug in a primary care setting can contain costs in a way that is acceptable to physicians. A policy of this type could be useful to the increasing number of health care provider organizations that cover the cost of outpatient medications.\r"

DESIGN: Mailed questionnaire survey. SUBJECTS: Gynecologists and general internists at two Boston teaching hospitals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Based on a 71% response rate, 72% of internists and 100% of gynecologists reported ever having prescribed CHT. Almost 60% of internists, compared with 8% of gynecologists, reported that over half of their female patients were older than 50 years of age. By logistic regression analysis of the internists' data, female gender of physician (odds ratio 11.0), belief that CHT decreases myocardial infarction risk (odds ratio 3.4), and knowledge of CHT's benefits and risks (odds ratio 2.8) were associated with prescribing. Endometrial biopsy was performed by a majority of physicians only when unexpected vaginal bleeding occurred and in cases of unclear menopausal transition. Physicians who were concerned about litigation were seven times more likely to perform baseline endometrial biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: In the authors' sample, as well as nationally, internists are more likely to provide care for menopausal women. Among internists, gender and knowledge are strongly associated with CHT prescribing. These findings have important educational implications if internists are to routinely provide information and counseling to women about osteoporosis and CHT.\r"

MEASUREMENTS: Clinical information, including observations needed to use previously published decision aids, was collected on special forms at the time of the emergency room visit. Follow-up information was obtained from the medical records of patients who were admitted and by telephone interviews with patients who were discharged. The authors compared the residents' actual decisions with the predictions of the decision aids regarding their ability to predict complications (that is, to identify patients who needed admission or intensive care). MAIN RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: None of the decision aids could reduce unnecessary admissions without seriously increasing the rate of inappropriate discharges. However, within the clinically relevant subgroup of patients for whom the decision to admit or discharge was not obvious on clinical grounds (those without complications on presentation whom the residents chose not to discharge), the decision aids examined, used in combination to verify the need for admission, might have safely averted some unnecessary admissions.\r"

PATIENTS: The 80 cases were patients identified by the nursing staff as having had a restraint applied within the last 24 hours prior to entry in the study. The 80 unrestrained controls were selected from the rooms adjacent to the cases' in order to match for proximity to the nursing station and nurse staffing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, data on diagnoses and treatments, results of the Folstein Mini-Mental State (MMS) test and an eight-item disruptive-behavior inventory, and outcome information were obtained for each patient using a standardized procedure. Three important patient characteristics were significantly associated with restraint use in a multiple logistic regression model: disruptive behaviors, nursing assessment of risk of falling, and cognitive impairment. Cases were older than controls, but age was not an independent characteristic associated with restraint use when controlling for cognitive impairment, risk of falling, and disruptive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Restraint use was more likely in patients with disruptive behaviors, at risk of falling, and with cognitive impairment. Attention to these factors and alternative strategies for dealing with them may reduce the use of physical restraints.\r"

DESIGN: Self-administered survey of alcohol use and level of injury in prior month. SETTING: Adult outpatients attending a university-based general internal medicine private practice. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: During a four-month period, 1,011 patients aged 18-65 years were asked to complete questionnaires while waiting to see a physician. The 791 who completed all forms appropriately are included in this study. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The total number of drinks and the total number of injuries reported during the preceding month were calculated. Nondrinkers reported an average of 0.51 (SD = 1.18) injuries in the prior month; and drinkers, 0.92 (SD = 1.70) injuries. Minor injuries were reported more frequently by heavier alcohol consumers only among younger patients (RR = 1.88). There was no association between reported injury and alcohol consumption among patients over 50 years of age (RR = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Minor injury is associated with heavier alcohol consumption in younger patients attending a general medical practice, but not among older patients. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship between alcohol drinking and minor injury.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with personal interviews that was part of the evaluation of a multi-site AIDS Health Services Program. SETTING: Outpatient clinics and AIDS community-based organizations. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: To be eligible for the survey, subjects had to be at least 18 years of age and enrolled in the AIDS Health Services Program for at least one month. 1,031 clients were interviewed in nine communities. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of those surveyed, 61% had thought a moderate or great amount about naming a proxy for health care decisions. The majority (68%) of the patients knew about prior directives, yet only 35% had been counseled and only 28% had a prior directive. Of those counseled, physicians had counseled only 11% (38/359). Gay/bisexual men were more likely to have been counseled and to have executed a prior directive than were others. Counseling was associated with having obtained a prior directive. Counseled subjects were 3.5 times more likely to have obtained a prior directive than were those not counseled. CONCLUSIONS: A gap exists between subjects' knowledge and implementation of prior directives. To help bridge this gap, the authors recommend that physicians not only attend to the technical aspects of patient care, but also determine patient values concerning life-sustaining therapy and counsel patients on prior directives.\r"

Patients with previous cholecystectomy or whose gallstones were diagnosed during life were excluded. The data were stratified by age and race and compared with those of a screening survey from Canada, a surgical series from New York, two screening surveys from Italy, and one from Denmark. The crude necropsy detection rates and the rates from the screening surveys were standardized to the 1970 federal census for Kansas City. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The standardized occurrence rates were similar and suggest that the epidemiologic necropsy accurately assesses the occurrence of asymptomatic gallstones in the living population, thus strengthening its validity as a research tool.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a natural experiment. SETTING: The general medical service of the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center, a major tertiary teaching hospital of the University of Minnesota internal medicine residency program. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were all the patients admitted to the medicine service from 5:00 PM to 6:00 AM over an eight-month period. INTERVENTION: After 5:00 PM, half of the patients were admitted to the hospital by a cross-covering senior resident (CC group of patients), and their care was transferred to a different senior resident the following day. The other patients were initially evaluated by the primary senior resident (PE group of patients). Assignment to the different services was a random, sequential process. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The CC group had significantly more laboratory tests performed during their hospital stay than did the PE group of patients (44 vs. 32, p = 0.01), even when adjusted for length of stay. Using multiple linear regression to adjust for other clinical parameters including length of stay, DRG weight, and number of consults, the authors found that being a CC subject was a significant predictor of the number of laboratory tests obtained (p = 0.01). Furthermore, the median length of stay in the CC group (n = 74) was longer than that in the PE group (n = 72) (eight days vs. six days); this was of borderline statistical significance, using a two-sample median test (p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Patients transferred to a different resident the day after admission had more laboratory tests performed and longer inpatient stays.\r"

DESIGN: Data from practicing physicians attending a continuing medical education course were obtained by questionnaire. After adjustment for sociodemographic differences, data from the physician population were compared with similar data previously obtained from a patient population. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one physicians (94% of the study population) agreed to participate. Ninety percent were primary care physicians. Fifty-eight percent practiced in the eastern United States. MAIN RESULTS: The physicians, like the regular patients, preferred that the principal role in decision making for their own illnesses be handled by their providers, not by themselves. As illness severity increased, physicians indicated significantly less desire for making decisions (p less than 0.01). The magnitudes of the effects of increasing illness severity upon the decision-making preferences of physician and regular patients were comparable (p = 0.53). Physician-patients, however, were slightly more interested than regular patients in making decisions (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: although physician-patients are slightly more interested than regular patients in making decisions, for the most part their preferences for autonomy resemble those of regular patients. These results suggest that medical knowledge and sociocultural factors are only minor determinants of patient attitudes towards autonomy. Rather, patients' preferences to be relieved of decision-making responsibility are better understood as part of the phenomenology of illness.\r"

  ".W": "The cochlear implant is a medical device, part of which is placed surgically, that uses electrical stimulation to provide hearing. For almost a decade, investigational studies have been ongoing to define its safety and efficacy in profoundly deaf children. During this period, more than 500 children aged 2 through 17 years have been implanted with either a single-electrode or multielectrode device. Extensive auditory, speech, educational, and psychologic testing has been performed before and after implantation. Results show that the cochlear implant provides auditory detection over much of the speech signal. Compared with the preimplant period, there is significant improvement in auditory discrimination and speech production skills. Limited open-set word and sentence recognition is possible for at least some children. Complications with the device have been minimal. The cochlear implant can provide sound to deaf children unable to benefit from hearing aids. The complex assessment, rehabilitation, and parent counseling should be performed by centers with the multidisciplinary staffs necessary to provide effective care for patients with this specialized auditory prosthesis.\r"

  ".U": "91093867\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate cardiac growth in fetuses of those diabetic mothers with good metabolic control, we examined M-mode echocardiographic measurements obtained from 24 fetuses of diabetic mothers (FODM) and compared these with measurements from 31 normal fetuses of similar gestational age. Fetuses were grouped into three gestational periods: 20 to 26 weeks, 27 to 33 weeks, and 34 to 40 weeks. The mothers were believed to have good metabolic control on the basis of mean daily glucose profiles and glycosylated hemoglobin A (HbA1C) values of approximately 110 mg/dl (610 mumol/L) and 7.5%, respectively, before fetal scanning, and estimated fetal weight similar to that of normal fetuses during all three gestational periods. Both FODM and normal fetuses had significant increases in M-mode measurements from period 1 to period 3, but in FODM, cardiac hypertrophy developed by late gestation (period 3). This involved the interventricular septum (6.1 +/- 0.7 vs 4.9 +/- 0.3 mm, p less than 0.05), right ventricular free wall (5.7 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm, p less than 0.01), and left ventricular free wall (6.4 +/- 0.6 vs 3.3 +/- 0.4 mm p less than 0.01). The interventricular septum/right ventricular free wall ratio was similar, whereas the interventricular septum/left ventricular free wall ratio in FODM was smaller by period 3 (1.0 +/- 0.1 vs 1.6 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05). The right ventricular diastolic dimension was similar, but the left ventricular diastolic dimension was significantly smaller in FODM during periods 2 and 3 (8.2 +/- 1.2 vs 12.2 +/- 0.7 mm, p less than 0.05). Strict metabolic control did not prevent FODM from having abnormal cardiac growth. We conclude that good metabolic control results in normal estimated fetal weight but that FODM remain at risk for mild global cardiac hypertrophy and altered diastolic dimensions.\r"

  ".W": "Lateral cerebral ventricular volume in 36 preterm infants with or without an intraventricular hemorrhage, and with or without posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, was measured longitudinally and compared with the ventricular index measurements of the same ventricles. A poor correlation was found (r2 = 0.67). To determine a reason for this poor relationship, we analyzed the volumes of the regions of the ventricles by a segmental volume analysis. The occipital region of the lateral cerebral ventricle enlarged at a much faster rate (1.904 +/- 0.477 ml/day) than either the anterior region (0.546 +/- 0.253 ml/day; p less than 0.01) or the middle region (-0.209 +/- 0.334 ml/day; p less than 0.01) in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The rate of growth of the middle region of the lateral cerebral ventricles was the same for all infants. Linear indexes, such as the ventricular index and the lateral ventricular ratio, do not allow for accurate serial estimates of ventricular size in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus because of asymmetric growth of the lateral cerebral ventricle. We conclude that sequential volume measurements are more useful than ventricular index measurements to follow ventricular size sequentially in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.\r"

  ".W": "Because febrile infants with no obvious source of bacterial infection may have bacteremia, and because bacteremia is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds, we used decision analysis to evaluate whether such infants should be treated with antibiotics, tested further, or sent home. Using a simple decision tree, we found that the decision to give empiric antibiotic treatment is the decision of choice. The difference in quality-adjusted life expectancy between the \"best\" and \"worst\" decisions was only 11 days. However, this difference translated to prevention of death or permanent disability in 60 cases per 100,000 febrile children. Further, empiric treatment remained the best management alternative unless the probability of bacteremia was less than 1.4% (less than any published prevalence), or the efficacy of treatment was less than 21%. Our analysis demonstrated that a test with far greater sensitivity than leukocyte count or other tests currently in use is needed to justify testing rather than treating empirically. Further, an enormous patient population would be needed to find a difference of both clinical and statistical significance between treated and untreated patients in a controlled trial. In the absence of such trials, we recommend blood culture and empiric antibiotic treatment of all infants at risk for occult bacteremia.\r"

There were no differences among the three study groups in the proportion of children considered \"better\" overall by the parent 48 hours after the initial assessment (drug, 67%; placebo, 71%; no treatment, 57%; p = 0.53). There were no differences among groups in individual or composite symptom score changes. Two thirds of parents whose children were eligible for the drug trial believed that their child needed medicine for cold symptoms. In the proportion of parents believing that their child needed medicine, there was no difference between those who consented to participate and those who refused. Parents who wanted medicine at the initial visit reported more improvement at follow-up, regardless of whether the child received drug, placebo, or no treatment. We conclude that there is no clinically significant improvement in symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, including no significant placebo effect, in young children for whom an antihistamine-decongestant is prescribed.\r"

The drug, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was taken orally for 6 months. Serum lipid concentrations were determined monthly. Computed tomography of the liver was performed before and during therapy to evaluate liver fat content. The younger sister had liver biopsies before and after 6 months of lovastatin therapy to assess hepatic cholesterol stores. Both patients had marked decreases in serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels increased. Computed tomography during treatment demonstrated a significant increase in linear attenuation, suggesting a decreased liver fat content. Liver tissue obtained 6 months after lovastatin therapy was initiated had 13% less esterified cholesterol than the liver sample obtained before treatment. We conclude that lovastatin may be effective in treating children with cholesterol ester storage disease.\r"

Of the available options, neither the Mayo Clinic nomogram nor the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University (FAO/WHO/UNU) equations produced estimates that differed significantly from measured values. In a second cohort of severely obese adolescent girls, the FAO/WHO/UNU equation that included both height and weight provided the most accurate estimate of metabolic rate. Because of their simplicity, we recommend use of the FAO/WHO/UNU equations to estimate metabolic rate in adolescent populations (boys: BMR = 17.5 weight (kg) + 651; girls: BMR = 12.2 weight (kg) + 746). However, when obese cohorts are studied, the FAO/WHO/UNU equation that includes both weight and height predicts metabolic rate most accurately (boys: BMR = 16.6 weight (kg) + 77 height (m) + 572; girls: BMR = 7.4 weight (kg) + 482 height (m) + 217).\r"

Of the 130 (28%) who smoked crack, 87 (67%) were designated as \"experimenters\" (use of crack 1 to 9 times); 20 (15%) were in an intermediate group (smoked crack 10 to 50 times); and 23 (18%) were heavy users (smoked crack more than 50 times). Sixty percent of heavy users progressed from initiation of crack use to its use at least once a week in less than 3 months. Almost 50% of the 87 experimenters and nearly all the 23 heavy users recalled preoccupation with thoughts of crack, rapid loss of the ability to modulate their use of the drug, and rapid development of pharmacologic tolerance. Suspiciousness, mistrust, and depressed mood were associated with the increasing use of crack. Seizures occurred in none of those who used cocaine by snorting it intranasally (without ever smoking crack), in contrast to 1% of the experimenters and 9% of the 43 respondents who had smoked crack at least 10 times. Seven percent of the 87 experimenters versus almost one fourth of the 43 who smoked crack more frequently had injected cocaine intravenously. The use of crack by middle-class adolescents is associated with rapid addiction and with serious behavioral and medical complications.\r"

Shigella species do not share related lipopolysaccharides, but they do possess closely related virulence plasmids that code for the proteins essential for cell invasion. We therefore sought to determine the frequency, amount, and duration of excretion of human milk antibodies to these shared virulence plasmid-associated antigens in populations of different rates of Shigella infection frequency (Mexico City, high; Houston, low). Such antibodies were present in the milk of virtually all the Mexican women but also were present in a large proportion of milk samples from the women living in Houston. The amounts of these antibodies were highest in colostrum but after 2 weeks of lactation fell to stable levels. The frequency and persistence of these antibodies in the milk of the women from Houston suggest that the memory and drive for secretion of these antibodies is extremely long lived.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the capacity of infants to digest and absorb rice cereal and to determine the effect of cereal feeding on total energy and nitrogen absorption. SETTING: Subject's residences and the Texas Children's Hospital Clinical Research Center, Houston. PATIENTS: Eight healthy 1-month-old bottle-fed infants. INTERVENTIONS: Infants were fed their usual formula for 3 days. For the subsequent 6 days, they received 4 gm of rice cereal, labeled with carbon 13, per 30 ml of the formula. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fecal balance studies were performed for a 72-hour period while the infants received only formula and again during the last 3 days of cereal feeding. Breath samples for hydrogen measurement were collected before and after the cereal feeding. Nutrient intake was measured and stools were analyzed for 13C abundance, energy, nitrogen, fiber content, and bacterial mass. Cereal absorption was 88 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD). Despite a significant increase in energy and nitrogen intake from cereal feeding, the coefficient of absorption fell (energy: 97% to 90%, p = 0.048; nitrogen: 94% to 74%, p = 0.009). Fecal dry weight increased after the cereal feeding (p = 0.004), primarily as a result of a sevenfold increase in fecal bacterial mass (p = 0.002). Fecal nitrogen increased primarily because of incorporation of nitrogen into bacteria. No differences were detected in breath hydrogen as a consequence of formula feeding versus formula-cereal feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Although cereal was relatively well-absorbed in this group of infants and increased their intakes of energy and nitrogen, it did not increase the coefficients of energy and nitrogen absorption. Cereal feeding increased fecal bacterial mass and bacterial nitrogen.\r"

  ".W": "This study utilized a historical cohort to examine the relationship between maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and the occurrence of congenital cardiovascular abnormalities. All neonatal drug screens performed at Boston City Hospital during an 18-month period were reviewed (n = 554); for 214 (39%) screened high-risk neonates, results of toxicologic screens were positive for cocaine, and 340 (61%) neonates had no detectable cocaine. We compared the occurrence of cardiovascular malformations and electrocardiographic abnormalities in these two groups. Matches were sought between these 554 infants and our pediatric cardiology data base, which consisted of inpatient consultation, outpatient consultation, and electrocardiography. Forty-nine patients had drug screens and were also entered into our cardiology data base: 25 had both consultations and electrocardiograms, and 24 had electrocardiograms only. The rate of cardiac anomalies among the cocaine-positive infants was significantly higher (relative risk = 3.7; 95% confidence interval: (1.4, 9.4)) than the rate of these anomalies among the cocaine-negative comparison group (65/100 vs 18/1000); the rate for cocaine-positive infants was also significantly higher than published rates for general populations of infants. Several electrocardiographic abnormalities, high-grade ventricular ectopy, and cardiorespiratory arrests were also noted in our study population. We conclude that cocaine exposure during prenatal life appears to predispose infants to structural cardiovascular malformations, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and, possibly, cardiopulmonary autonomic dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "We describe 14 patients with glutaric aciduria type 1 in five Canadian Indian kindreds living in Manitoba and northwest Ontario. The patients had marked clinical variability of the disease, even within families. Eight followed the typical clinical course of normal early growth and development until the onset of neurologic abnormalities, often precipitated by infection, between 6 weeks and 7 1/2 months of age. Five patients had early developmental delay; one was thought to be normal until 8 years of age. Three patients died, seven are severely mentally and physically handicapped, and four have only mild mental retardation or incoordination. Six patients had macrocephaly in the neonatal period. Computed tomography was done for 12 patients, and findings were abnormal in 11. Glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid were detected in increased amounts in the urine of all patients, but the concentrations were much lower than those in most other reported patients. Glutaryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity in skin fibroblasts, interleukin-2-dependent lymphocytes, or both, ranged from 0% to 13% of control values. There was no correlation between clinical severity and urine glutaric acid concentration or level of residual enzyme activity. We recommend that organic acid analysis of the urine be done in patients with unexplained cerebral palsy-like disorders, especially if the computed tomographic scan is abnormal. If there is suspicion of glutaric aciduria, glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase should be measured in fibroblasts or lymphocytes even if glutaric acid is not increased in the urine.\r"

One patient with a large thoracic hemangioma, cardiorespiratory failure, and consumptive coagulopathy died after less than 2 months of treatment. The remaining four patients have shown beneficial responses, including (1) regression of abnormal vessels on pulmonary angiogram and improved exercise tolerance in pulmonary hemangiomatosis (two patients), (2) decreased corticosteroid and/or platelet transfusion requirements in consumptive coagulopathy (two patients), and (3) decreased size and number of tumor nodules in the one patient with angiosarcoma arising in preexisting angiomatous lesions. Responses occurred during periods of 2 to 20 months of treatment. There was no measurable progression of angiomatous lesions in any patient receiving interferon at the therapeutic dose, except possibly in the one who died. Each of the four surviving patients had improved linear growth and weight gain during interferon treatment.\r"

Ninety-two blunt trauma patients required massive transfusion (MT) of 20 or more units of packed red blood cells (range, 20-126). Eighty-two per cent of all transfused blood was given within 24 hours of admission. Forty-eight patients (52%) were long-term survivors. Twenty-six patients died (28%) within 24 hours and 21 of these exsanguinated. Eighteen patients died greater than 24 hours: nine (50%) died from multiple organ failure, and nine (50%) died from severe closed head injury (CHI). Clinical predictors of increased mortality were: shock on admission, closed head injury, and age. Forty-three survivors were followed for a mean of 2.5 years (range, 1-5 years). No patient died during followup. All patients were home at 1 year; only four patients required continued medical assistance. Thirty-two patients (74%) returned to work. We conclude that: 1) blunt and penetrating trauma patients receiving MT have similar survival rates of 50%; 2) shock, closed head injury, and age predict increased mortality but do not preclude survival; 3) long-term outcome in blunt patients requiring MT is excellent. Post-discharge death is rare and 3/4 of the survivors return to work, justifying the high cost of acute care.\r"

Physics predicts that size and velocity, not weight, are the primary factors affecting crash forces, while increased weight or increased velocity consumes more fuel. Analysis of fatal injury rates, injury costs, and fuel use relation to vehicle weight, vehicle size, and engine horsepower confirms that weight is of minimal importance in injury severity compared to the other two factors. Fuel use is a function of weight and horsepower. Injuries and fuel use can be reduced by reducing vehicle horsepower without changing vehicle size.\r"

Treatment for these injuries requires immediate and aggressive surgery in most circumstances, but conservative treatment may be justified in certain instances. During a 4-year period, eight cases of high-pressure injection injury were encountered. The types of injected material were: four from paint, and one each from grease, water, benzene, and hydraulic oil. Time is an important factor regarding the results, while the types of injected material modify the clinical courses. It is advisable that the etiology of high-pressure injection injury should be established initially, and this factor be taken into consideration in choosing treatment options.\r"

In one patient a fresh fracture of the dens caused dislocation of C1/2 with reversible occlusion of the left and stenosis of the right vertebral artery, resulting in unconsciousness. In a patient with pseudarthrosis of the dens an aneurysm of the vertebral artery could be detected.

In four patients the fistula was located peripherally and the blood flow was small. These fistulas closed spontaneously within 3 months. However, a centrally located fistula with early visualization of the trunk of the portal vein persisted in one patient and necessitated transcatheter embolization. The APF in this patient caused portal dilatation which was detectable by CT scan. We conclude that spontaneous closure can be expected when an APF is located peripherally and the shunt flow is small, while centrally located APF with large flow require active treatment, preferably by transcatheter embolization. An APF detectable by CT scan suggests the need of intervention.\r"

A subset of patients with facial fractures will also have intracranial injuries (ICI). We sought to identify parameters associated with an increased risk for ICI. We also sought to examine the safety and limits of early craniofacial repair in patients with intracranial injuries. Of 114 mid-face fractures treated over a 1-year period, 43 (38%) had a concomitant ICI. The majority, 36 (84%), were from motor vehicle accidents (MVA). Frontal sinus and orbitoethmoid fractures were at the highest risk for ICI, although orbitozygomatic fractures caused by MVAs also had a surprisingly high incidence of ICI. Our results show that early craniofacial repair can be performed safely with appropriate general surgical and neurosurgical support.\r"

This report describes experience with seven patients who sustained injuries in explosions of multipiece tire rims. All victims suffered massive maxillofacial trauma with associated ocular, cranial, intracranial, and extremity injuries. Two patients died, both because of intracerebral hemorrhage. One patient suffered serious long-term disability. All survivors required extensive reconstructive surgery. The design of the multipiece tire rim is inherently hazardous. Since many accidents of this type are not reported to the NHTSA, the incidence of such injuries may be significantly higher. An alternative, nonhazardous tire rim is available. Design modifications or a law restricting use of multipiece tire rims would prevent many accidents.\r"

Heat loss from the skin was 74 +/- 15 W/m2, and from the abdominal cavity, 350 +/- 122 W/m2 (p less than 0.002; ratio = 1:4.7). The area of the skin was 0.52 +/- 0.06 m2, and of the abdominal cavity, 0.04 +/- 0.006 m2 (ratio = 13.6:1). For every 13.6 watts lost from the skin, 4.7 watts were lost from the abdominal cavity; i.e. skin heat loss accounted for 74% of total heat loss. Therefore adequate insulation would reduce the incidence of hypothermia. Evaporation accounted for the largest heat loss from the abdominal cavity. Evaporative losses could be minimised by enclosing the bowel in a plastic bag.\r"

Practices are most commonly based at a community hospital in an urban setting. Half of surgeons treating trauma operate at more than one hospital and nearly a third take call at more than one hospital simultaneously. Eighty-seven per cent of respondents reported trauma patients comprise less than one quarter of their practice. Most (68%) admitted fewer than 25 trauma patients to their service in the year before the survey and 78% reported performing less than ten trauma laparotomies in the prior year. Fifty-eight per cent disagree that every general surgeon should routinely manage major trauma and 83% feel that traumatology entails a specific body of knowledge and expertise. Of the various components of trauma care, the role of the surgeon in trauma prevention and administrative duties was ranked at least important. The areas of surgeon availability, uniformity of basic experience and adequate maintenance of skills need further analysis.\r"

Twenty-two per cent had one associated injury, 15% had two, and 10% had three or more. Most spine fractures involved the lower cervical (29%) or thoracolumbar junction (21%). Comparisons of presence or absence of associated injuries and spine fracture level showed significant differences (p less than 0.001). Eighty-two per cent of thoracic fractures and 72% of lumbar fractures had associated injuries compared to 28% of lower cervical spine fractures. While there was no significant relationship between type of associated injury and spine fracture level, those with associated injuries were less likely to have a neural deficit (p less than 0.05). After hospital admission, there were seven deaths. Early assessment and transport of spine trauma victims must be carried out with appropriate management of associated injuries. Conversely, multiple trauma victims must be handled with due regard for a possible spine fracture. The value of spinal units with specially trained personnel is emphasized.\r"

Similarly, patients with hollow viscus injuries were more likely to be rear seat passengers and to be lap belted than were patients with injuries to the spleen, liver, pancreas, or kidneys. Nearly two thirds of the lumbar Chance-type fractures were associated with hollow viscus injuries, including six of seven children. This increased risk of Chance-type fractures and hollow viscus injuries was associated with increased use of lap-belt seat restraints in the population.\r"

The concanavalin A or phytohemagglutinin-induced T-cell proliferation in vitro was markedly decreased in comparison to healthy donors. In contrast, B-cell proliferation stimulated by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I was not altered. While the absolute lymphocyte counts and the percentage of T, B, and O cells were within the normal range, nine out of the 26 patients showed a significantly diminished ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Humoral immunity in the patients was less affected as assessed by the unchanged serum levels of immunoglobulins (Ig). However, the T-cell dependent polyclonal Ig synthesis after in vitro stimulation with pokeweed mitogen was suppressed. Our results provide evidence that cell-mediated immune functions are predominantly impaired in patients with post-traumatic osteomyelitis which may contribute to the persistence of the localized bone infection.\r"

The univariate analyses showed that age, hypovolemic shock, massive volume administration (MVA), sepsis, and time of evolution before arriving to the hospital (TE) were significantly associated with MOF. Logistic regression analysis showed that neither age nor MVA were independently associated with MOF after adjusting for all of the other variables. Interactions seemed to be present between age, sepsis, and shock. We conclude that in our surgery and trauma ICU adult patient population, hypovolemic shock, sepsis, and TE are independent risk factors for MOF. The importance of the association between shock and sepsis is discussed, as well as the possible relevance of TE as a risk factor.\r"

Recent animal studies indicate that HS increases bleeding during uncontrolled hemorrhage, although the mechanisms for this are unclear. To investigate potential anticoagulant effects of HS (without dextran), normal human plasma was serially diluted with either HS or normal (0.9%) saline (NS). Prothrombin times (PT), activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT), and platelet aggregation studies were performed. Significant (p less than 0.05) deteriorations in clotting tests and platelet aggregation developed when 10% or more of normal plasma was replaced by HS, whereas there was no effect from similar NS dilutions. Strong correlations were observed between clotting test changes and sodium concentrations (R2 greater than 0.80, p less than 0.0001). Thus, HS exhibits anticoagulant activity, but not at the usual small volumes necessary to produce hemodynamic improvement. Nevertheless, the anticoagulant effect may be more pronounced with ongoing clotting factor losses or with the addition of dextran.\r"

Five patients had developed sepsis after major abdominal surgery, 15 patients after multiple trauma with head injury (HTI-ISS 38 +/- 2 and Glasgow Coma Scale 4 +/- 1). The urea production rate (UPR) could be significantly reduced by the intramuscular administration of 1.5 IU of rhGH/kg bodyweight (BW) per day (UPR day: 5, 62 +/- 6.7 gm/d vs. UPR day: 10, 42.6 +/- 5.9 gm/d). The catabolic index of Bistrian (BI) was significantly lower after rhGH therapy on day 10 compared to day 5. IGF-1 increased significantly after the administration of rhGH. The nitrogen balance, however, did not become positive, despite the administration of rhGH. The changes in sepsis were estimated by the scoring system according to Elebute and Stoner on days 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13. In those patients who were available for post-treatment evaluation the parameters had returned to baseline values after the withdrawal of rhGH. Results indicate that this therapy might ameliorate the nitrogen intake, but has no influence on the course of sepsis. Compared to previously published results in nonseptic patients, the somatomedin inhibitors as well as the split-products of the complement system and the metabolites of arachidonic acid may have been responsible for this weak effect of rhGH and IGF-1 in septicemia.\r"

  ".W": "Severe trauma favors the susceptibility of patients to infection. It has been shown that proteins or protein fragments are responsible for an endogenous immunodepression. After trauma a coagulopathy accompanied by increased serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) is often found. Therefore, we examined whether FDP-D can influence the activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). PMN-activation was measured by two different superoxide-specific methods (Cytochrome-C-test, INT-test). With both methods we found a decrease of PMN activity by FDP-D compared to fibrinogen. Albumin, which was used as a control protein, only influenced PMN activity in unphysiologically high concentrations. The third method used to quantify PMN activity was chemiluminescence, which is a more unspecific method since it is developed not only by oxygen radical species but also by activating the lipoxygenase pathway. In contrast to the superoxide specific tests we found an inhibitory effect of fibrinogen and also serum compared to FDP-D using chemiluminescence.\r"

The upper airway was simulated with the head of a Resusci-Annie which was attached to a test lung. The esophagus and stomach were simulated with a Penrose drain connected to a rolling seal spirometer via a PEEP valve. Fifteen paramedic volunteers ventilated the model utilizing mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-mask, bag-valve-mask, or portable field ventilator (Impact or HARV). Recording of tidal volume, gastric volume, and proximal and distal airway pressure was completed at three different levels of compliance. At normal compliance, all methods except the HARV met or exceeded American Heart Association standards. As compliance decreased, tidal volume fell and gastric insufflation increased. At a compliance of 0.02 L/cm H2O all methods failed to meet AHA standards and gastric insufflation volume equalled delivered tidal volumes for mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-mask techniques. Mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-mask techniques generated the largest tidal volumes but also created the largest volume of gastric insufflation. The Impact ventilator provided an acceptable tidal volume with minimal gastric insufflation. Our results suggest that mouth-to-mask ventilation with supplemental oxygen enrichment is the most efficient technique for non-invasive airway management.\r"

  ".W": "Among 440 adult patients with tibial shaft fracture and accompanying fibular fracture there were eight cases with radiographically ununited fibulae 4 months after the injury, each with uneventful tibial union. Fractures with severe soft-tissue injuries were excluded from this study. In 293 patients the treatment method of the tibial fracture was conservative, comprising closed reduction and immobilization by long plaster cast. In 147 patients it was intramedullary Kuntscher nailing, and all the eight cases with delayed fibular union occurred among these, the frequency being 5.4%. The typical accompanying fibular fracture to develop delayed union was a comminuted one in the middle or distal third of the bone. At a followup examination 5 to 8 years after the original injury four of the eight fractures were found to have ultimately spontaneously united, while three showed a radiographically indisputable nonunion. One patient had undergone segmental fibular ostectomy because of persistent local pain but in the remaining patients the subjective symptoms were negligible. The occurrence of delayed fibular union in association with rigid intramedullary nailing of concomitant tibial shaft fracture is a phenomenon of which trauma surgeons should be aware even if the natural course of the condition often seems to be benign.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate renal tubular epithelial cell injury mediated by reactive oxygen molecules and to explore the relative susceptibility of epithelial cells and endothelial cells to oxidant injury, we determined cell injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in four renal tubular epithelial cell lines including LLC-PK1, MDCK, OK and normal human kidney cortical epithelial cells (NHK-C). Cells were exposed to reactive oxygen molecules including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical generated by xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine. We determined early sublethal injury with efflux of 3H-adenine metabolites and a decline in ATP levels, while late lytic injury and cell detachment were determined by release of 51chromium. When the cells were exposed to 25, 50, and 100 mU/ml xanthine oxidase with 5.0 mM hypoxanthine, ATP levels were significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in LLC-PK1, NHK-C and OK cells compared to MDCK cells while ATP levels were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) in endothelial cells compared to all tubular cell lines. A similar pattern of injury was seen with efflux of 3H-adenine metabolites. When the cells were exposed to 50 mU/ml xanthine oxidase with 5.0 mM hypoxanthine for five hours, total 51chromium release was significantly (P less than 0.001) greater in LLC-PK1, NHK-C and OK cells compared to MDCK cells, while total 51chromium release was significantly (P less than 0.001) greater in endothelial cells compared to all tubular cells. However, lytic injury was the greatest in LLC-PK1 cells and NHK-C cells while cell detachment was the greatest in endothelial cells. MDCK cells were remarkably resistant to oxidant-mediated cell detachment and cell lysis. In addition, we determined ATP levels, 3H-adenine release and 51chromium release in LLC-PK1, NHK-C and endothelial cells in the presence of superoxide dismutase to dismute superoxide anion, catalase to metabolize hydrogen peroxide, DMPO to trap hydroxyl radical and DMTU to scavenge hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. We found that catalase and DMTU (scavengers of hydrogen peroxide) provided significant protection from ATP depletion, prevented efflux of 3H-adenine metabolites and cell detachment while DMPO (scavenger of hydroxyl radical) prevented lytic injury. In addition, we found that the membrane-permeable iron chelator, phenanthroline, and preincubation with deferoxamine prevented cell detachment and cell lysis, confirming the role of hydroxyl radical in cell injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The characteristic spindle-shaped or stellate appearance of MC was altered after treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF). After two hours, the MC retracted and lost reciprocal contacts. Furthermore, this treatment altered the cytoskeletal organization of MC, since a peripheral band of actin and stress fibers disappeared while the streaks of vinculin at focal contacts decreased. These changes were reversible when the MC were cultured in fresh medium. After five minutes of treatment with platelet activating factor (PAF), changes similar to those induced by TNF were observed. Inhibitors of PAF synthesis, such as plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and an anti-inflammatory peptide, blocked changes induced by TNF, PAF receptor antagonists inhibited changes induced by PAF and also by TNF. These results and the finding that MC are stimulated to produce PAF by TNF suggest that PAF is a secondary mediator of the changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal organization induced by this cytokine.\r"

  ".W": "In rat membranous nephropathy, protein-uria is due to formation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex of complement (C), and is associated with morphological evidence of glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) injury. Analogous morphological changes are induced by C5b-9 in cultured GEC. In addition, in cultured GEC C5b-9 induces Ca2+ influx, as well as Ca2+ mobilization and increased 1,2-diacylglycerol due to the activation of phospholipase C. In this study we investigated how this GEC activation pattern might influence C-mediated GEC injury. We demonstrate that the C5b-9-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) did not impair ATP generation by mitochondria, suggesting that it does not contribute to cytotoxicity. Moreover, this increase in [Ca2+]i protected GEC from C-mediated cytolysis. However, a large increase in [Ca2+]i (produced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187) impaired ATP generation and aggravated C-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that intact mitochondrial activity is necessary for GEC to withstand C attack. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) also decreased C-mediated cytolysis. Conversely, C lysis was enhanced in GEC that had been pretreated for 18 hours with a high dose of PMA to deplete PKC, and following PKC inhibition with H-7. Therefore, PKC activation, possibly resulting from C5b-9-induced increase in 1,2-diacylglycerol, triggered mechanisms that protected GEC from C-mediated injury. Thus, as a consequence of C5b-9-induced phospholipase activation, the amount of C-induced GEC injury is diminished.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if this was the due to a lower rate of net secretion of K in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) and/or an enhanced rate of reabsorption of K in the medullary collecting duct (MCD). Secondary active secretion of K in the CCD raises the [K] in the lumen as compared to the plasma [TF/P)K). If the (TF/P)K is greater than 1, there was secondary active secretion of K in this nephron segment. The (TF/P)K in the CCD was measured by microcatheterization of the collecting duct. Three groups of rats were studied: rats on a low-K diet with and without the acute administration of DOCA, and rats on a normal-K diet treated with DOCA on a chronic basis. Rats on the low-K diet had a (TF/P)K of 0.8 +/- 0.11; this value did not rise to values significantly greater than 1 after the acute administration of DOCA (1.4 +/- 0.35). In contrast, chronic administration of DOCA to rats fed a normal-K diet did result in a (TF/P)K which was significantly greater than unity (3.1 +/- 0.39). The degree of hypokalemia was not significantly different in these rats. The absolute and fractional reabsorption of K in the MCD was not different in the rats on the low-K diet with or without DOCA. We conclude that the nephron segment which is responsible for the reduced kaliuretic response to mineralocorticoids is the CCD.\r"

The importance of an increase in biosynthesis of AVP in the hypothalamus has, however, not heretofore been investigated and is the purpose of the present study. CCF secondary to infarction of myocardial tissue was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and sham operated animals served as controls. Four weeks later hypothalamic AVP mRNA was determined by solution hybridization using sense and anti-sense strand RNA. The blood pressure was lower in CCF than sham animals (131.2 +/- 3.1 vs. 112.8 +/- 4.0 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) and the total heart, and right and left ventricle weights were significantly higher in CCF rats. Plasma AVP was higher in CCF (sham 6.78 +/- 0.30; CCF 11.46 +/- 0.64 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was also higher in CCF than sham animals (205 +/- 36 vs. 554 +/- 56 pg/ml, P less than 0.001). The AVP mRNA in hypothalamus was significantly higher in CCF than sham animals (55.5 +/- 3.7 vs. 95.9 +/- 4.0 pg/micrograms total RNA, P less than 0.001). There was no difference in beta-actin mRNA in the hypothalamus of sham and CCF rats, indicating that the AVP-mRNA increase was specific in CCF. These results therefore demonstrate that increased AVP biosynthesis in the hypothalamus, in addition to release of the hormone from the posterior pituitary, may occur in CCF.\r"

Two doses of ketanserin were used: a high dose that, in addition to its serotonin blocking effect, possessed alpha 1-adrenergic blocking capacities; and a low dose that acted only as a serotonin S2 blocking agent. The effects of the high dose were compared to the effects of phenotolamine. Both the high dose of K and phentolamine resulted in a similar fall of systemic blood pressure from 117 +/- 4 to 78 +/- 3 and from 121 +/- 4.5 to 76 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.01). Despite this fall, GFR and RPF remained unchanged from 2.36 +/- 0.16 +/- to 2.26 +/- 0.12 ml/min, and from 5.33 +/- 0.41 to 5.76 +/- 0.5 ml/min with K, while both parameters significantly decreased with phentolamine. A remarkable preservation of the autoregulation of RBF until a renal perfusion pressure (RPP) of 70 to 75 mm Hg was noted with K, but not with phentolamine or Ringer infusion. With the low dose of K, a significant rise in GFR and PAH clearance was noted, from 2.12 +/- 0.17 to 2.59 +/- 0.18 and from 4.81 +/- 0.35 to 5.66 +/- 0.48 ml/min, respectively (P less than 0.05). A similar preservation of autoregulation of RBF was observed. Our studies suggest that in the pressure ranges below normal autoregulation of RBF in the rat, serotonin blockade is associated with maintenance of both GFR and RBF.\r"

HSP 90 was predominantly present in the region from the distal convoluted tubule to the medullary collecting duct at a high intensity, and in glomerular podocytes and Bowman epithelial cells at a much lower intensity. Other segments of the nephron were stained little, even at a lower dilution of the antibody. Blood vessels and interstitial tissues were not stained. HSP 90 was localized in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of HSP 90 showed greater intensity at the luminal side of the cells.

Rats were fed either a standard diet or a standard diet containing one percent probucol for two weeks prior to study. Probucol lowered serum cholesterol in both normal and BUO rats. Probucol did not significantly affect renal function in normal rats. BUO rats given probucol had greater inulin and PAH clearances at three to five hours and three days following release of BUO than rats with BUO not given probucol. Kidneys from obstructed rats had higher levels of malondialdehyde, an index of lipid peroxidation, a greater number of leukocytes in the cortex, decreased levels of reduced glutathione and increased levels of oxidized glutathione. Renal cortex from obstructed rats treated with probucol had significantly higher levels of reduced glutathione than kidneys of obstructed rats not given probucol. A decrease in cholesterol, using another lipid-lowering agent, lovastatin, did not modify renal function in rats with BUO. The data can be interpreted to indicate a role for reactive oxygen species in the pathophysiology of obstructive nephropathy. The improved renal function seen in probucol-treated rats with BUO may be due to an effect of this agent in affecting accumulation of reactive oxygen metabolites and/or decreasing the number of leukocytes infiltrating the renal cortex.\r"

Because conventional determination of the percentage of glomeruli affected by sclerotic lesions is usually based on the examination of randomly selected sections, we wondered whether glomeruli appearing normal in a given section could be affected by sclerosis in other regions of the capillary tuft (CT). To assess the real incidence and the spatial extension of sclerotic changes at the level of single glomerulus, we used serial-section morphological analysis to measure the volume of the glomerulus and that of sclerosis lesions. In glomeruli from control rats and in glomeruli from adriamycin (ADR) treated rats surface area of Bowman's capsule (BC), CT and sclerotic regions were measured using stereology techniques in all the consecutive sections containing each individual glomerulus, and corresponding volumes were then calculated. Mean volume of BC and CT were not significantly different between control and ADR rats (0.71 +/- 0.03 and 0.53 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.76 +/- 0.04 and 0.53 +/- 0.02 microns 3 x 10(-6), respectively). The distribution of glomerular volume parameters in the ADR rats were more spread out than in control animals, indicating that some glomeruli became smaller while other became larger. No sclerotic changes were found in control rats, while in the three ADR rats 94, 90 and 92% of glomeruli, respectively, were affected by sclerotic lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.2 micrograms/100 g/day) by the same route as the tracer resulted in the following changes: in p.o. rats the serum [3H]-1,25(OH)2D3 intercept was much lower but the slope was not changed; in i.p. rats the intercept was not changed but the slope was increased. Both p.o. and i.p. treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 lowered the weight gain and diet consumption, and increased serum calcium, kidney tissue calcium and urinary excretion of orally administered 45Ca. All the measures of bioactivity were greater in the i.p. dosed rats than in the p.o. dosed rats.

  ".W": "Angiotensinase A (aminopeptidase A; ATA) is an angiotensin II splitting exopeptidase, which is localized in endothelial and epithelial cells of the glomerular tuft. In order to investigate the influence of a reduction in renal mass on enzyme activity, ATA activity was measured in isolated rat glomeruli five and 14 weeks after 1-1/3 nephrectomy. Glomerular ATA activity in remnant kidneys increased significantly after five weeks following ablation compared with glomeruli of two kidney control rats (5.34 +/- 4.02 vs. 1.71 +/- 1.96 mU/mg protein, P less than 0.05). After 14 weeks, however, this difference was no longer present. Treatment of rats with enalapril or saralasin inhibited the increase of ATA seen five weeks after renal ablation, whereas indomethacin had no effect on enzyme activity. Furthermore, normal two kidney rats, treated with furosemide, revealed a higher glomerular ATA than two kidney controls (5.5 +/- 2.64 vs. 2.1 +/- 1.7 mU/mg protein, P less than 0.05). In vitro superfusion of isolated glomeruli with enalaprilate or furosemide from rats after renal ablation did not influence enzyme activity, however, superfusion with 0.05 mM angiotensin II or 0.05 mM saralasin significantly reduced ATA. Our results suggest that glomerular ATA might be involved in the early regulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and could modify glomerular adaptation to reduce renal mass by affecting angiotensin II degradation.\r"

There was a similar decrease in plasma potassium following either insulin with glucose (0.65 +/- 0.09 mmol/liter) or albuterol (0.66 +/- 0.12 mmol/liter), and a substantially greater fall with the combined regimen (1.21 +/- 0.19 mmol/liter, P less than 0.02 vs. either drug alone). Baseline plasma glucose concentrations were similar (about 4.8 mmol/liter) prior to all three treatments. Following insulin with glucose, plasma glucose increased transiently. but then fell to 2.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter at one hour, with concentrations below 3 mmol/liter in 9 of 12 patients. None of the patients had symptoms of hypoglycemia. Plasma glucose increased to 6.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/liter with albuterol. After the combined drug regimen plasma glucose rose transiently and was back to baseline (4.7 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter) at one hour. Treatment with insulin or albuterol produced trivial increases in heart rate, whereas the combined drug regimen was associated with a significant rise (15.1 +/- 6.0 min-1). These observations suggest that albuterol and insulin with glucose are equally efficacious in lowering plasma potassium in uremic patients, and that the hypokalemic effects of the two drugs is additive. The hypoglycemic effect of insulin is attenuated by coadministration albuterol. Combined therapy with insulin, glucose and albuterol is efficacious and safe for the acute treatment of hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients.\r"

GH may contribute to allograft loss in post-transplant hypertensive patients (PT x HT). HF and GH may be evaluated by renal response to acute protein intake (API). Since ACE inhibition may prevent GH, the effects of fosinopril (Fos) were evaluated in 10 PT X HT on azathioprine and prednisone. Patients received 5 to 40 mg/day of Fos during 12 months. Baseline MAP (111.1 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) was significantly reduced by 10 to 12 mm Hg, rising to 114.7 +/- 2.7 mm Hg after Fos was administered. GFR (63.7 +/- 5.9 ml/min) decreased after 4 (48.1 +/- 4.6, P less than 0.05) and 12 months (50.7 +/- 4.6, P less than 0.05), rising to 59.4 +/- 5.6 after Fos was given. There was no GFR response to API before and after one month of Fos, however, a clear response became apparent at 4 (+ 27% P less than 0.05), and 12 months (+ 18%, P less than 0.05), disappearing after Fos discontinuation. Proteinuria (918.8 +/- 710.6 mg/d) decreased after 4 (72.3 +/- 21.6 mg/d, P less than 0.05) and 12 months, rising to 297.8 +/- 172.3 mg/day after therapy. GFR response to API in 22 controls and 17 uninephrectomized donors was 13 and 11%, respectively. Lack of response to API in PT x HT suggests HF and GH. Reduction of GFR, restoration of response to API and reduction of proteinuria, indicate that ACE inhibition with fosinopril ameliorates HF and GH. This effect may be beneficial in preventing hemodynamic-mediated allograft injury.\r"

In three families close linkage between the mutation causing the disease and DNA markers on chromosome 16 was demonstrated.

  ".W": "In the present study we evaluated the distribution of cell adhesion molecules, referred as very late antigens (VLA), in the normal human kidney and in mesangial cells in culture (MC). In addition, we assessed the functional properties of VLA proteins on MC. Normal human kidney and MC were stained by immunoperoxidase with mouse monoclonal antibodies to VLA proteins. We demonstrated that VLA-3, a protein that binds FN, laminin and collagen, is the predominant VLA protein in the human glomerulus and on MC. VLA-3 is located in the mesangium and on the glomerular visceral epithelial cell and endothelial cell surfaces in contact with the glomerular basement membrane. VLA-1 was demonstrated in the glomerular mesangium and VLA-5, an FN specific receptor, was present in the mesangium on glomerular endothelial cells and on MC. VLA-2 and VLA-4 were not present in the normal glomerulus nor on MC. In functional studies we evaluated the binding of MC to FN coated surfaces and the binding and phagocytosis of FN coated fluorescent beads by MC. We showed that MC bind to FN coated surfaces and that the binding is inhibited by anti-FN antibodies, EDTA and peptides containing the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). In addition, anti-VLA-5 but not anti-VLA-3 antibodies inhibited significantly the binding of MC to FN, MC demonstrated binding and phagocytosis of FN coated beads and, purified FN inhibited both phenomena. By affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation we demonstrated that MC FN binding proteins and MC VLA proteins are composed of two distinct protein chains that have Mr characteristics similar to those of normal human fibroblasts VLA proteins. In conclusion, the glomerular distribution of VLA-3 suggests that this protein is primarily involved on the adhesion of glomerular cells to basement membranes and matrix. MC FN receptors (VLA-5) mediate the binding of MC to FN and could mediate the phagocytosis of FN coated antigen or immune complexes by mesangial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Hemodynamic changes were measured during high-efficiency hemodialysis (HEHD) using three dialysis solutions: L-lactate (46 mM), bicarbonate (35 mM + 4 mM acetate), and acetate (39 mM). Cardiac output was determined by changes in thoracic electrical bioimpedance. Although there appeared to be subtle differences in hemodynamic response to L-lactate versus bicarbonate, the blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were affected less with either of these solutions than with acetate. In particular, neither L-lactate nor bicarbonate HEHD were associated with a change in cardiac output, whereas with acetate HEHD a marked (22%) increase in cardiac output was seen concurrently with a moderate fall in blood pressure and TPR. Both acetate and L-lactate HEHD were associated with hypoxemia, whereas with bicarbonate HEHD the PO2 did not change. With L-lactate HEHD, correction of pH and plasma HCO3 concentrations was delayed but these values were not significantly different from those obtained with bicarbonate HEHD by one hour after dialysis. Potassium removal was comparable with the three dialysis solutions. Phosphorus removal with L-lactate tended to be slightly less than with bicarbonate, but not less than with acetate. Our results suggest that L-lactate (46 mM) dialysis solution may be a suitable alternative to acetate for HEHD, being associated with a hemodynamic profile that is similar to that of bicarbonate and better than that of acetate. Our results further suggest that the hypoxemia associated with the use of acetate dialysis solution is not intrinsic to acetate, but is due either to a low dialysis solution PCO2 level or to accelerated consumption of oxygen during substrate metabolism.\r"

We therefore performed a four center, double-blind placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effects of post-hemodialysis intravenous injection of L-carnitine in ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Thirty-eight patients received up to six months of L-carnitine infusions (20 mg/kg) post-dialysis and 44 patients received placebo infusions. In both groups of patients, baseline pre-dialysis plasma and red blood cell total carnitine levels were normal, but pre-dialysis plasma-free carnitine concentrations and free/total ratios were subnormal, and plasma acyl levels were elevated. Post-dialysis plasma free and total carnitine concentrations were also subnormal. Plasma and red blood cell total carnitine levels rose eightfold in carnitine recipients, but were unchanged from baseline in those receiving placebo. There were no significant changes observed in plasma triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol or other lipoprotein parameters in either the carnitine or placebo treated groups. We conclude that carnitine metabolism is altered in uremia. Furthermore, in a randomly-selected hemodialysis population, L-carnitine injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg results in significant increases in blood (and perhaps tissue) carnitine levels, but this is not associated with any major effects on lipid profiles.\r"

Eighty-two long-term hemodialysis patients, who were given either carnitine (N = 38) or placebo (N = 44), completed this study. In each group, clinical and biochemical parameters during treatment were compared with baseline values. Intra-dialytic hypotension and muscle cramps were reduced only in the carnitine treated group, while improvement in post-dialysis asthenia was noticed in both carnitine and placebo groups. Maximal oxygen consumption, measured during a progressive work exercise test, improved significantly in the carnitine group (111 +/- 50 ml/min.

We analyzed linkage of the Alport gene to polymorphic loci on the X chromosome in three families with Alport syndrome. In two of the families, epidermal basement membranes of affected members showed altered immunohistologic reactivity with a discriminating antibody (FNS1) that identified a 26 kD peptide in the NCl domain of basement membrane collagen. In the third family epidermal basement membranes of affected individuals reacted normally with the antibody. The disease gene mapped to the Xq21-q22 region of the long arm of the X chromosome in the two families with altered basement membrane antigenicity and in the family with normal basement membrane antigens. We conclude that Alport syndrome in each of these kindreds arose from allelic mutations at a single genetic locus, although we cannot at this time exclude the possibility that two or more tightly linked genes are involved. As the genes for the known chains of type IV collagen are on chromosome 13, our findings suggest that the Alport gene may encode a new basement membrane collagen chain.\r"

However, soft tissue calcification has been regarded as rare in pediatric renal patients. Following a sudden death due to pulmonary calcinosis in an adolescent after renal transplantation, we retrospectively reviewed clinical, biochemical and autopsy data of 120 patients with uremia, on dialysis, or following renal transplantation cared for at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1960 to 1983. Soft tissue calcification was found in 72 of 120 patients (60 percent). Forty-three patients (36 percent) had systemic calcinosis (Group A): the most frequent sites of mineral deposition were blood vessels, lung, kidney, myocardium, coronary artery, central nervous system, and gastric mucosa. Vascular calcification was uniformly accompanied by deposits in other organs. Twenty-nine patients had small amounts of focal calcification (Group B) and 48 patients had no soft tissue calcification (Group C). By multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of vitamin D or its analogues, the form of vitamin D medication prescribed, the peak calcium x phosphorus product, the age at onset of renal failure, and male sex were jointly associated with calcinosis (Group A). Vitamin D therapy showed the strongest independent association with calcinosis and the probability of calcinosis was greater in patients receiving calcitriol when compared with dihydrotachysterol and vitamin D2 or D3. The duration of renal failure, peak serum calcium, serum calcium at death, serum phosphorus at death, and primary renal diagnosis, were not statistically associated with calcinosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unfortunately, calcium citrate (Ca citr), when given with Al-gel, markedly enhances Al absorption. To determine whether calcium acetate (Ca acetate) also augments Al absorption, 10 normal volunteers were each given orally, three-day courses of the following drug combinations dosed four times daily: 1) aluminum hydroxide gel (Al[OH]3) (5 ml) alone; 2) Al[OH]3 (5 ml) plus Ca acetate (1330 mg); 3) Al[OH]3 (5 ml) plus Ca citr (950 mg). A nine day wash-out occurred between each course. Al levels were measured using flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Daily urine Al excretion was measured during a two-day baseline before each course and during each three-day drug course. Plasma Al was obtained during each baseline and drug course. Mean 24-hour Al excretion (micrograms/g creatinine/day) at baseline versus treatment for each combination was: 1) 5.9 +/- 3.2 versus 42.0 +/- 40.7 (mean +/- SD); 2) 5.7 +/- 3.0 versus 40.3 +/- 28.6: 3) 6.3 +/- 3.4 versus 175.8 +/- 103.3.

  ".W": "We studied the adaptation to early (72 hr) and late (20 days) K loading (400 mmol/day, 4 equal meals every 6 hour) in six healthy humans. Throughout the study, each single K meal was followed by an acute transient rise in plasma K, aldosterone and kaliuresis. \"K balance\" (urinary K excretion approximately 80% of intake) was achieved in the second 24 hour period of K loading. This was associated with elevated plasma K and aldosterone, slightly negative sodium (Na) balance and stimulated plasma renin activity. At 20 days of K loading Na loss had been compensated. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone had returned to baseline, although the latter kept increasing after each single K meal. Compared to the first K meal, the K meals at 72 hours and 20 days of K loading were followed by more kaliuresis, while the natriuretic effect had disappeared. Abrupt discontinuation of K loading was followed by negative K balance, lasting only 24 hour, and by Na retention, lasting 72 hours. In conclusion, switching to a high K diet in humans is immediately followed by increased renal K excretion, and by Na loss. K excretion increases over a few days, while Na loss is halted. This can be explained by the rise in plasma aldosterone, secondary to elevated plasma K and renin activity. After weeks, renal adaptation forms an additional factor promoting K excretion and preventing natriuresis. The latter appears specifically from the Na retention which occurs after discontinuation of K loading in the absence of persistent aldosterone stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Renal function with respect to water clearance and renal hemodynamics was studied in 15 patients with obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma. The results were compared with those of the control normal subjects. There was no change in renal function in the patients with mild to moderate jaundice, with total serum bilirubin from 8.0 to 15.1 mg/dl. Increased urinary sodium excretion and decreased free water and negative water clearances were observed in the patients with severe jaundice with total serum bilirubin from 27.0 to 40.4 mg/dl and normal serum albumin. Renal blood flow was normal, but creatinine clearance was decreased. In severely jaundiced patients with serum bilirubin from 30.5 to 40.1 mg/dl and hypoalbuminemia urinary sodium excretion, free water clearance, negative water clearance, renal blood flow and creatinine clearance were decreased. There was salt and water retention in this group. The findings suggest that in severe jaundice there is inhibition of sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. ADH and increased hydraulic conductivity of the collecting tubules possibly contribute to decreased free water clearance. In severely jaundiced patients with hypoalbuminemia this salt losing effect is converted to salt retention by increased proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of different dialysis membranes on the production of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures (PBMNC) obtained from hemodialysis patients in a prospective cross-over design study. Chronic dialysis with cuprophane membrane leads to an increase in beta 2m production from 129 +/- 11 ng/ml to 192 +/- 23 ng/ml (P less than 0.002). This increase is reversed by the use of a non-complement activating membrane polymethylmethacrylate. In addition, during chronic dialysis with cuprophane membrane, an increasing proportion of these cells display low beta 2m expression on their surface (from 6.1 +/- 0.8% of PBMNC to 16.9 +/- 3.4%, P less than 0.001), concomitant with the emergence of cells with low density of HLA on their surface (from 4.9 +/- 1.2% of cells to 32.9 +/- 7.8% of cells, P less than 0.001). The total content of cell-associated beta 2m is also decreased in dialysis patients in general, and in particular in patients chronically dialyzed with new cuprophane membrane. These effects can be reproduced by incubation of PBMNC with cuprophane membranes, and with the addition of C5a, IL-1 and TNF in vitro. Thus, chronic dialysis with cuprophane membrane may be a factor in the genesis of high beta 2m levels and causes changes in beta 2m and HLA expression on cell surfaces.\r"

  ".W": "The development of a 24 hour radioimmunoassay for erythropoietin (EPO) using EPO derived from recombinant DNA as both immunogen and ligand is described in the present paper. Mixed breed rabbits immunized with 10 micrograms/kg of EPO derived from a stably transfected cell line (Elanex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bothel, Washington, USA, through McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis, Missouri, USA; \"MD\") produced antibodies to EPO with high titer (up to 1:896,000 final dilution in the tube), high affinity (8.4 x 10(11) liter/M), and good specificity. Purified EPO from the above source or from AmGen Biologicals (Thousand Oaks, California, USA; \"AG\") were successfully radioiodinated with the chloramine-T method and used as ligand in the radioimmunoassay. Standard dose-response curves prepared with EPO from both commercial sources were not significantly different and showed a sensitivity of 0.75 to 0.96 mU/tube. The dose-response curves in both systems also showed parallelism with serially diluted serum from a patient with aplastic anemia. Within-assay and between-assay precision were determined by assaying multiple replicates of a serum pool. Recovery of exogenous EPO added to a serum pool averaged 97% for both systems. The range of normal human serum EPO was determined by assaying the sera of 153 hematologically-normal adult subjects and was found to be 1.1 to 27.3 mU/ml for MD EPO and 0.5 to 16.7 mU/ml for AG EPO. Sera from several patients with hematologic abnormalities were also assayed, including those of 36 patients with anemia of end-stage renal disease (mean +/- SEM, 29.5 +/- 4.0 mU/ml; P less than 0.01). In conclusion, this new, more rapid and sensitive radioimmunoassay system can be used to measure EPO levels in sera from normal human subjects and patients with several types of anemia, and should also be very useful in therapeutic drug monitoring of patients receiving EPO from various commercial sources.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical and physiologic studies in individual segments of the cortical collecting duct (CCD) and outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) have provided evidence for the presence of an H-K-ATPase which is involved in the reabsorption of potassium in exchange for protons. The present study was designed to determine the cellular distribution of H-K-ATPase immunoreactivity in the CCD and OMCD of the rat and rabbit using mouse monoclonal antibodies against hog gastric H-K-ATPase. Kidneys of normal rats and rabbits were preserved for light microscopic immunohistochemistry and embedded in paraffin. Sections were incubated with the primary antibody followed by the avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase procedure. Sections incubated without primary antibody or with a non-specific mouse Ig served as controls. Light microscopy revealed diffuse cytoplasmic staining indicating H-K-ATPase immunoreactivity in intercalated cells in the CCD and OMCD in both rat and rabbit. In all segments studied except the rat CCD, the percentage of H-K-ATPase immunoreactive cells corresponded to the percentage of intercalated cells. In the rat CCD only 23% of the cells were reactive with H-K-ATPase antibodies, which is less than the percentage of intercalated cells in this region. It is possible that only type A intercalated cells possess H-K-ATPase immunoreactivity or that some intercalated cells did not have sufficient activity to be detected by our method. These results demonstrate H-K-ATPase immunoreactivity in the intercalated cells of the CCD and OMCD of rat and rabbit, suggesting that these cells are involved in potassium reabsorption in exchange for proton secretion in the mammalian collecting duct.\r"

Donor tissue was obtained from the homozygous beige mouse and a mouse line transgenic for the beta-globin gene, which provided distinct cellular and nuclear markers which were used to distinguish donor from recipient nephrons. Differentiation and growth of donor nephrons occurred in the host kidney and included vascularized glomeruli, mature proximal tubules, and tubular extensions into the renal medulla. Glomerular filtration was demonstrable in donor nephrons using FITC-dextran as a marker of filtration into the proximal tubules. Transplantation of metanephric tissue into adult mouse kidneys did not lead to glomerular or tubular differentiation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of adding functioning nephrons to mammalian kidneys in species in which there is ongoing nephrogenesis post-natally.\r"

In the adjuvant chemotherapy group, patients received cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy 3 or 4 weeks after operation and the average cycle of chemotherapy was 2.3 (from 1 to 6 cycles). In this trial, no evidence of improved survival or delayed recurrence was seen in the treated patients. In multivariate analysis of prognostic variables, the most important factor was the pathological stage of the disease and, second, DNA ploidy of the primary tumor. Although histology (squamous vs. non-squamous cell carcinoma) had a trend to influence the survival, it was not a significant factor. A total of 33 patients had recurrences: 17 and 16 patients were in control and adjuvant chemotherapy groups, respectively. Postrecurrent survival in the adjuvant chemotherapy group was significantly shorter than that in the control group, as determined by the generalized Wilcoxon and log rank tests. Median survival time after recurrence in the control and adjuvant therapy groups was 18.5 and 7.5 months, respectively. These results suggest that DNA ploidy of primary tumors should be considered as a prognostic factor in future trials of adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, analysis of postrecurrent survival in the adjuvant chemotherapy trial, as well as that of overall and disease-free survivals should be done.\r"

  ".W": "Permanent hypoparathyroidism is one of the most distressing complications of thyroid surgery. The incidence of this iatrogenic complication varies between 3 and 25 percent among patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. Parathyroid injury may be caused by inadvertent removal of the parathyroids, ligation of the blood supply, or destruction secondary to capsular hematoma. Attention to such technical details as identification of the parathyroids, dissection close to the thyroid gland, preservation of the blood supply to the parathyroids, and avoiding manipulation of parathyroids reduces the incidence of temporary and permanent hypoparathyrodism. However, if the parathyroids are injured, the best method of preserving their function is by autotransplantation. Over the past 7 years we have performed 250 thyroidectomies. An attempt was made to identify and preserve parathyroid gland in each case. Even during lobectomy procedures, the ipsilateral parathyroids were identified and preserved. Whenever any of the parathyroids was devascularized or separated from the surrounding structures, it was autotransplanted into the sternomastoid muscle. The sternomastoid was chosen for autotransplantation rather than forearm muscles to avoid an added incision and because selective measurement of parathormone is not essential in this group of patients. Prior to autotransplantation, confirmation of the nature of the tissue was made by frozen section of a small portion of the parathyroid gland. Parathyroid autotransplantation was performed in 15 instances, even when only one parathyroid was injured. Only one member of this group of 15 patients developed temporary hypoparathyroidism, which disappeared after 4 weeks of calcium supplementation. The remaining patients had an uncomplicated recovery. Autotransplantation of the parathyroid glands should be performed whenever the parathyroid is devascularized or damaged by retraction or hematoma. It is essential for every thyroid surgeon to be familiar with the technique of parathyroid autotransplantation.\r"

On Northern, Southern, and Western blot analysis, the p53 gene and its product appear to be normal in DU-145. PC-3, however, failed to demonstrate expression of either the p53 transcript on Northern blot analysis or the p53 protein on Western blot analysis, while the Rb gene products appeared to be normal on both Northern and Western blot analysis.

Reproducible, high-quality DNA histograms were obtained on the paraffin-embedded specimens by using our modified flow cytometric procedure. One aneuploid (10%) and two hyperdiploid tumors (20%) were found in the oncocytoma group. There was no correlation between these abnormal DNA histographic patterns and survival or tumor stages. On the contrary, a good correlation was found between tumor grades and DNA ploidy in the controls. We conclude that renal oncocytoma is a clinically benign tumor, yet it may exhibit varying degrees of flow cytometric DNA abnormalities, which have no predictive value on survival and probably reflect the characteristics of oncocytes rather than its malignant potential.\r"

(Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 277:436-466) reported the effectiveness of adjuvant specific active immunotherapy of lung carcinoma in improving the postoperative survival of stage I lung carcinoma patients in a phase II study using lung carcinoma-associated antigen (TAA) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). A phase III study was then designed by the authors to see the effects of specific active immunotherapy compared to the conventional management (no treatment) and to nonspecific immunotherapy. From 1976 to 1981, 85 patients with resectable (stages I and II) squamous cell lung carcinoma were entered into a randomized study: 1) control group; 2) specific immunotherapy group--three monthly doses of 500 micrograms of TAA emulsified with CFA; 3) nonspecific immunotherapy group--three monthly doses of CFA emulsified in saline. All the patients in the study received skin tests with 100 micrograms of the same TAA used for the immunotherapy. Recently, a 5-year follow-up of all the patients became available: The life table 5-year survival of group 1 was 34%, of group 2 was 75%, and of group 3 was 53%. The median survivals for the three groups were group 1, 38 months; group 2, 106 months; and group 3, 71 months. The difference was significant at P = .007 (Cox-Mantel test).\r"

Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed a total of 56 children under 4 years of age with coarctation repair between 1977 and 1986. Thirty-four had the subclavian flap angioplasty technique and 22 had resection with oblique end-to-end anastomosis. The group was further subdivided to include only the 23 infants less than 3 months of age--eight infants with resection with oblique end-to-end anastomosis (less than or equal to 3ETE) and 15 infants with subclavian flap angioplasty (greater than or equal to 3SFA). The remaining 33 patients older than 3 months of age were divided into 14 patients with resection and oblique end-to-end anastomosis (greater than 3ETE) and 19 patients with the subclavian flap angioplasty technique (greater than 3SFA). The overall mortality was not significantly different between techniques. Postoperative hypertension was significantly more prevalent with end-to-end anastomosis than with the subclavian flap angioplasty technique (p less than 0.01). Seven patients had recurrent coarctation. The 6-year actuarial freedom from recoarctation was 93% +/- 6% in the less than or equal to 3SFA group compared with 53% +/- 20% in the less than or equal to 3ETE group (p less than 0.02), but there was no significant difference in those children operated on at a later age regarding the type of coarctation repair. Therefore, we recommend subclavian flap angioplasty in patients less than 3 months of age. In those older than 3 months either procedure is safe and the risk of recoarctation is similar.\r"

To evaluate the results of therapy in this group, we reviewed the records of 32 patients with primary esophageal malignant tumors of unusual histologic type. Thirteen patients (41%) had sarcoma, eight (25%) melanoma, and 11 (34%) had oat cell carcinoma. Dysphagia was present in 78% (25/32) of the patients for a median of 13 weeks before diagnosis. Location of the esophageal primary tumor was upper third in four patients (12%), middle third in 12 (38%), and lower third in 16 (50%). Treatment consisted of esophagectomy in 10 of 13 patients with sarcoma (77%), seven of eight with melanoma (88%), and three of 11 with oat cell carcinoma (27%). Patients not undergoing resection received chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 46% and 23% for sarcoma (median 20 months), 13% and 0% for melanoma (median 5 months), and 0% and 0% for oat cell carcinoma (median 5 months), respectively. Distant disease was the initial form of recurrence in 73% (11/15) of patients undergoing curative therapy. Surgical resection appears indicated for localized primary esophageal sarcoma. Optimum treatment of primary esophageal melanoma is less clear, but surgical resection may be of benefit in selected patients. Esophageal oat cell carcinoma is a systemic disease necessitating systemic therapy with local therapy reserved for palliation of dysphagia.\r"

To document this change, we analyzed two groups of patients in 1981 (n = 1586) and 1987 (n = 1513) to document preoperative and postoperative variables important in determining immediate morbidity and mortality after isolated coronary bypass. Between 1981 and 1987, patients were found to be older (greater than or equal to 70 years, 8.7% versus 21.8%, p less than 0.0001), more often diabetic (15% versus 24%, p less than 0.0001), have a greater prevalence of triple vessel disease (14.5% versus 46.1%, p less than 0.0001), and have more left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 0.60 +/- 14 versus 0.54 +/- 13, p less than 0.0001). To facilitate analysis and because of overlap between subgroups, we subdivided patients into three subgroups for statistical comparison of the years 1981 and 1987: subgroup I, no prior procedure (n = 1546 in 1981 and 1396 in 1987); subgroup II, optimal group (n = 503 in 1981 and 292 in 1987, and defined as no prior procedure, ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and age less than 65 years); subgroup III, patients having reoperations (n = 40 in 1981 and 117 in 1987). Internal mammary artery grafting was infrequently used in 1981 but was used in 72.1% in 1987. Major postoperative morbidity between the 2 years for the total population increased significantly: need for intraaortic balloon pumping, 1.4% versus 4.7%, p less than 0.0001; myocardial infarction 3.5% versus 5.5%, p less than 0.008; stroke, 1.4% versus 2.8%, p less than 0.008; and wound infection, 1.0% versus 3.0%, p less than 0.001. Wound infection (all types) in 1987 was increased sevenfold in patients having a perioperative myocardial infarction (0.7% versus 5%, p less than 0.0001). For young patients with good left ventricular function (subgroup II), there was no increase in these morbid events between 1981 and 1987. Hospital mortality in the total population increased significantly between 1981 and 1987 from 1.2% to 3.1% (p less than 0.0002), respectively. It was lowest for the patients in optimal condition (subgroup II) in both years, 0.8% versus 1.1%, and highest for reoperative patients, 5.3% versus 4.3%. In 1981, 58% of patients (503/870) were in the optimal group compared with 35% (292/828) in 1987 (p less than 0.0001). The last six years have seen a progressive trend in surgically treating older, sicker patients who have more complex disease, with a significant reduction in the best candidate group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The object of this study was to assess the usefulness of the dipyridamole-echocardiography test in the early evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafting, when the use of an exercise stress test is precluded. We studied 39 consecutive patients (37 men and two women, mean age 57.3 years) referred to our institute for elective coronary artery bypass. Five patients had single, 12 patients double, 20 patients triple vessel disease, and two had left main stem disease. Nineteen left internal mammary artery grafts, 20 sequential grafts, and 39 single vein grafts were performed. All the patients were subjected to the test before (time range 1 to 3 days) and after (time range 6 to 10 days) the operation in the absence of therapy. Dipyridamole was administered intravenously 0.56 mg/kg over 4 minutes (low dose); if no effect was apparent, an additional 0.28 mg/kg over 2 minutes (high dose) was given. During the test, blood pressure and a twelve-lead electrocardiogram were monitored. An arbitrary wall motion score was derived by dividing the left ventricle into six regions and grading from 0 to 3-normokinetic, hypokinetic, akinetic, and dyskinetic zones. Preoperatively the test was positive in 38 patients as evidenced by wall motion abnormalities (36 patients had electrocardiographic changes) and in one patient by electrocardiographic changes and chest pain; 22 tests were positive after the low dose and 17 after the high dose. Angina was present in 33 patients. Mean wall motion score was 1.64 per patient in the basal condition and 4.03 per patient after the test (p less than 0.001). After coronary bypass in three patients the test was positive at the same dosage that was used preoperatively, as shown by wall motion abnormalities (in two patients by electrocardiographic changes, as well). Four patients had symptoms. Furthermore, at 6 months' follow-up, a treadmill stress test performed in these three patients was positive for ischemia and angina. The wall motion score was 1.25 per patient in the basal condition and 1.53 per patient after the test (no significant difference). When the preoperative wall motion score obtained after dipyridamole echocardiography was compared with the postoperative score, a statistically significant difference was seen: 4.03 per patient versus 1.53 per patient (p less than 001). In eight patients we observed an improvement of basal myocardial contractility after the operation, which indicates the reversibility of wall motion abnormalities observed before coronary bypass. In conclusion our data show that the dipyridamole-echocardiography test is a suitable method for the early assessment of bypass grafting when other methods, exercise dependent, are not indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Mean age was 56.8 years in the group in which this artery was used and 61.8 years in the group in which it was not (p less than 0.001). All other preoperative characteristics including number of women, extent of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and preoperative left ventricular function were not significantly different between the two groups. An internal mammary artery graft was concomitantly used in 68 patients (97%) of the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft and in 61 patients (87%) without such a graft. The mean number of distal anastomoses was 3.3 and 3.4, aortic crossclamp time was 65.3 +/- 19.9 minutes and 54.0 +/- 20.1 minutes, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 114.8 +/- 23.6 minutes and 112.9 +/- 25.0 minutes, respectively, in the groups with and without a gastroepiploic artery graft. Only aortic crossclamp time was significantly (p less than 0.05) longer in the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft. There were two (2.9%) early deaths and two (2.9%) new Q-wave infarctions in both groups. Intraaortic balloon pumping was required in five patients (7.1%) in the group with a gastroepiploic artery graft and in three patients (4.3%) without this graft. Postoperative complications were similar and rare in both groups. Intraoperative endoscopic laser Doppler study demonstrated no significant change of gastric mucosal blood flow before and after division of the gastroepiploic artery. We concluded that there is no additional risk in the use of the gastroepiploic artery for coronary bypass grafting, and a favorable outcome can be expected.\r"

  ".W": "Our experience with the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries has confirmed the attainability of excellent results with elective neonatal surgery. Up to this time, we have repaired tetralogy of Fallot during the neonatal period only when symptoms, either severe persistent cyanosis or cyanotic spells, have been present. This review assesses the results of such nonelective neonatal correction of tetralogy between 1973 and 1988. Twenty-seven neonates with either symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot or symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot with valvar pulmonary atresia underwent repair. Mean age at repair was 8 +/- 8.4 days and mean weight was 3.0 +/- 0.7 kg. Unsatisfactory palliative shunts had previously been placed elsewhere in four patients. Twenty-five transannular patches and two conduits were used for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract. There were five deaths in the hospital, three of which were due to avoidable technical problems. All deaths occurred in patients with pulmonary artery (Nakata) index less than 150 mm2/m2. One premature child weighing 2.3 kg displayed an absent pulmonary valve-like syndrome after repair and died late of respiratory complications caused by aneurysmal branch pulmonary arteries. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 74%. There was a single rapidly declining hazard phase for death, with the hazard approaching zero at 1 1/2 years after repair. Actuarial freedom from need for reoperation was 76% at 5 years. Postoperative catheterization of 15 long-term survivors showed right ventricular pressure less than 70% systemic in 13 cases. All patients are symptomatically well and functioning in sinus rhythm 1 to 15 years after repair (mean, 5 +/- 4 years). This experience with neonates with symptoms suggests that, if mortality is lower in the absence of symptoms, elective repair of tetralogy of Fallot could be reasonably undertaken during the first months of life.\r"

Five deaths occurred in the hospital (5.7%; 70% confidence limits, 3.2% to 9.7%). A preoperative New York Heart Association class V functional condition was the only incremental risk factor (p = 0.02) for death in the hospital. No patient (0%; 70% confidence limits, 0% to 2.15%) had complete heart block. Actuarial survival rate at 80 months was 81.4%. The only incremental risk factor (p = 0.005) leading to reoperation was a preoperative valve incompetence. Actuarial rate at 80 months for freedom from reoperation was 84.2% in the overall group of patients after repair of atrioventricular septal defect.

The intent was (1) to develop a model of energy-depleted and functionally depressed heart to be used in subsequent studies of myocardial protection and (2) to characterize the biochemical changes following different interventions. Forty-five minutes of normothermic global ischemia produced severe depletion of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate (greater than 70%) but was associated with 85% +/- 10% recovery of left ventricular function. Postischemic functional depression (less than 30% recovery) could be produced by either (1) extending the ischemic duration to 60 minutes or (2) preceding 45 minutes of ischemia by 60 minutes of hypoxic stress (oxygen tension 25 to 30 mm Hg). Neither of these more severe interventions caused more profound depletion of adenosine triphosphate or creatine phosphate, but hypoxic stress produced marked tissue depletion of glutamate (52%) and aspartate (48%) before aortic clamping. Longer ischemia or preceding hypoxia led to greater myocardial accumulation of lactate (greater than 250 versus 104 mumol/gm dry weight) and succinate (18 versus 11 mumol/gm dry weight) during aortic clamping, p less than 0.05 versus 45 minutes of ischemia) and greater postischemic depression and amino acid (greater than 65% aspartate depletion) and carbohydrate (greater than 50% glycogen depletion) metabolism, p less than 0.05 versus simple ischemia. These findings suggest that more severe ischemic/hypoxic models are needed in immature hearts to produce functional depression, and the biochemical analyses suggest the characteristics of metabolic defects that must be corrected to resuscitate these hearts during surgical correction of congenital defects.\r"

Retrospective studies in children have estimated a prevalence of phrenic damage of between 0.5% and 2.2%, but all these studies have limited their investigations to patients who have clinical problems postoperatively, and they have all used clinical or radiologic methods to diagnose the damage. These methods are indirect and hard to evaluate, making the accurate early diagnosis of phrenic nerve damage very difficult. Measurement of phrenic nerve conduction time (phrenic latency) allows direct evaluation of phrenic function and integrity, making it potentially much more specific than indirect methods. Using a simplified method of direct phrenic nerve stimulation, we have developed a method of measuring phrenic latency at the bedside in infants and children. A 1 Hz electrical stimulus is applied over the phrenic nerve in the neck and a diaphragmatic electromyogram from the seventh and eighth intercostal spaces is displayed on a storage oscilloscope. Phrenic latency can be measured directly from the screen. Using these methods we have now studied 37 children (aged 2 days to 15 years) before and after cardiac operations. Mean phrenic latency was 5.4 +/- 1.0 msec on the right and 5.4 +/- 1.0 msec on the left. Prolongation of phrenic latency by more than 2 msec was found in seven of 66 postoperative measurements (10.6%). These patients had a substantially worse postoperative course. We believe this technique to be an important contribution to the diagnosis of postoperative phrenic nerve damage, and one that can help in clinical practice to elucidate an important cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality.\r"

Prostacyclin is a powerful inhibitor of platelet aggregation as well as a potent vasodilator. The levels of its stable metabolite prostaglandin F1 alpha increase significantly in children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass during heart operations but decrease to preoperative levels after bypass. To determine the effect of long-term bypass on prostacyclin levels, multiple plasma samples were analyzed in 10 human neonates both during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy and within 24 hours after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Prostaglandin F1 alpha, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, was quantitated by radioimmunoassay in picograms per milliliter. Prostaglandin F1 alpha levels were elevated while the patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy but decreased with duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In most infants, prostaglandin F1 alpha levels rose again during weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and remained elevated for 24 hours after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

  ".W": "We wished to determine if reduction in the standard heparin administration for cardiopulmonary bypass could be accomplished safely with the use of membrane oxygenators. An experimental study was designed to evaluate two different heparin administration protocols for cardiopulmonary bypass with hollow-fiber membrane oxygenators. Two groups of six pigs were submitted to hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (28 degrees C) for 3 hours, then rewarmed, decannulated, and reassessed after 1 hour. In group I (control) heparin was administered to maintain the activated clotting time in excess of 450 seconds; in group II activated clotting time was maintained between 250 and 300 seconds. The mean total heparin administered was 41,000 units in group I and 25,000 units in group II. Concentration of coagulation factors II, V, and VIII, fibrinogen, and platelet count were determined before, during, and 1 hour after bypass. No significant difference in any of these coagulation parameters was observed between the groups. The performance of the oxygenators was similar in both groups, with no evidence of thrombosis. Thus reduced heparin administration, enough to keep activated clotting time between 250 and 300 seconds, was not related either to major coagulation factors and platelet consumption or to derangements in the oxygenator's performance.\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen immature puppies (2 to 4 kg) underwent 1 hour of acute hypoxia (oxygen tension 25 to 30 mm Hg), followed by 45 minutes of normothermic global ischemia on total vented bypass with normal blood reperfusion. Ventricular function was assessed by inscribing Starling function curves and measuring stroke work indices before hypoxia and after reperfusion. Seven puppies (control) received normal saline infusion at 4 ml/kg/hr. Six other puppies received a 4 ml/kg/hr intravenous infusion of glutamate/aspartate, glucose-insulin-potassium, mercaptopropionyl glycine, carnitine, and catalase during hypoxia and reperfusion. In control hearts, acute hypoxia depleted myocardial glutamate and aspartate by 52% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia) and 48% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia) and caused severe hemodynamic deterioration (55% decrease of stroke work index) (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia); three of seven (43%) required premature institution of bypass. Postischemic left ventricular function recovered to only 40% of control levels (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia). In contrast, intravenous metabolic infusions maintained tissue glutamate (p less than 0.05 versus control group) and aspartate (p less than 0.05 versus control group) in treated hearts during hypoxia and allowed cardiac index to rise 20% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia); all treated hearts tolerated 1 hour of hypoxia, and stroke work recovered 70% (p less than 0.05 versus control group) of stroke work index after subsequent ischemia. Impaired tolerance of immature hearts to acute hypoxia and subsequent ischemia is due to substrate depletion. This impairment can be reduced by intravenous metabolic support during hypoxia and reperfusion and leads to improved recovery of postischemic function.\r"

  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that multidose, hypocalcemic aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegia provides safe and effective protection during prolonged aortic clamping of immature hearts. Of 17 puppies (6 to 8 weeks of age, 3 to 5 kg) placed on vented cardiopulmonary bypass, five were subjected to 60 minutes of 37 degrees C global ischemia without cardioplegic protection and seven underwent 120 minutes of aortic clamping with 4 degrees C multidose aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegia ([Ca++] = 0.2 mmol/L), preceded and followed by 37 degrees C blood cardioplegic induction and reperfusion. Five puppies underwent blood cardioplegic perfusion for 10 minutes without intervening ischemia to assess the effect of the cardioplegic solution and the delivery techniques. Left ventricular performance was assessed 30 minutes after bypass was discontinued (Starling function curves). Hearts were studied for high-energy phosphates and tissue amino acids. One hour of normothermic ischemia resulted in profound functional depression, with peak stroke work index only 43% of control (0.7 +/- 0.1 versus 1.7 +/- 0.2 gm x m/kg, p less than 0.05). There was 70% depletion of adenosine triphosphate (7.6 +/- 1 versus control 20.3 +/- 1 mumol/gm dry weight, p less than 0.05) and 75% glutamate loss (6.6 +/- 1 versus control 26.4 +/- 3 mumol/gm, p less than 0.05). In contrast, after 2 hours of aortic clamping with multidose blood cardioplegia preceded and followed by 37 degrees C blood cardioplegia, there was complete recovery of left ventricular function (peak stroke work index 1.6 +/- 0.2 gm x m/kg) and maintenance of adenosine triphosphates, glutamate, and aspartate levels at or above control levels adenosine triphosphate 18 +/- 2 mumol/gm, aspartate 21 +/- 1 versus control 2 mumol/gm, and glutamate 25.4 +/- 2 mumol/gm). Puppy hearts receiving blood cardioplegic perfusion without ischemia had complete recovery of control stroke work index. We conclude that methods of myocardial protection used in adults, with amino acid-enriched, reduced-calcium blood cardioplegia, can be applied safely to the neonatal heart and allow for complete functional and metabolic recovery after prolonged aortic clamping.\r"

Sixty-nine were male (86%) and 11 female (14%), with 1.9 +/- 1.1 (standard deviation) ventricular tachycardia morphologies per patient. The mean number of drugs failed was 3.7 +/- 1.6 per patient. The preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was 36.4% +/- 14.4%. Complete preoperative endocardial mapping data (greater than 4 endocardial sites in each ventricular tachycardia) were available for 60 of the 80 patients (75%) and intraoperative endocardial data in the clinical ventricular tachycardia was obtained in 37 (46.3%) of the patients. In 17 patients mapped intraoperatively by computer-assisted techniques, complete epicardial and endocardial data in the clinical ventricular tachycardia were obtained in 14 patients (82.4%). Overall, 73 of 80 (91.3%) had some mapping data available. Hospital mortality occurred in 10 patients (12.5%) at a mean interval of 13.5 days, range 0 to 62 days. Postoperatively the clinical ventricular tachycardia has not recurred in 65 of 70 surviving patients (92.9%). Nonclinical ventricular tachycardia occurred in another four patients. All nine patients with postoperative ventricular tachycardia responded to drugs. The major factors predictive of hospital mortality were prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (greater than 150 minutes), preoperative ejection fraction less than 31%, and incomplete preoperative mapping. Hospital mortality in patients with an ejection fraction below 31% was significantly associated with a history of amiodarone usage. At 3 years of follow-up, freedom from sudden cardiac death was 95.7%, and 86.7% of patients were free of ventricular tachycardia on no antiarrhythmic drugs. These results suggest that direct ventricular tachycardia operations are an effective form of therapy for patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.\r"

Postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias occurred in 186 patients (23%) but did not contribute to any of the six early deaths (30-day mortality rate, 0.8%). Mean (+/- standard deviation) length of hospital stay was longer (9.8 +/- 5.7 versus 8.3 +/- 3.5 days; p less than 0.0001) and mean age was older (65 versus 60 years; p less than 0.002) in patients with postoperative supraventricular tachycardia than in those with regular rhythm. Risk of supraventricular tachycardia was increased in patients with a history of atrial arrhythmias (45% versus 22%; p less than 0.002) or premature atrial contractions on the preoperative electrocardiogram (48% versus 22%; p less than 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified age 65 years or more, history of atrial arrhythmia or preoperative premature atrial contractions, and preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mm Hg or more as independent predictors of postoperative supraventricular tachycardia. Six percent of patients converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously; 82% of patients converted within 1.1 +/- 1.9 days after onset of supraventricular tachycardia on treatment with digoxin or beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or both. Only 10% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia required electrical cardioversion. We conclude that the risk of supraventricular tachycardia after coronary artery bypass is influenced by patient-related variables and is effectively managed by conventional therapy. Prophylactic treatment should be reserved for elderly patients, especially those who have atrial arrhythmias or have preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mm Hg or more.\r"

  ".W": "Recent experiments have revealed synapses that selectively mediate right and left vagal regulation of sinoatrial function in the fat pad overlying and surrounding the right pulmonary vein complex. However, precise vagal postganglionic pathways to the sinoatrial region have remained obscure. Such pathways, including critically important neural inputs to sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal regions, may be vulnerable to surgical approaches to atrial or intracardiac repair. The present experiments seek to delineate specific autonomic pathways to the sinoatrial region of the canine heart. The distal ends of the cut right and left cervical vagi and the right and left ansae subclaviae were electrically stimulated (10 to 20 Hz, 1 msec, 2 to 3 V) before and after surgical incisions were placed. Cut No. 1 was made longitudinally along the ventral caval surface from the pericardial reflection caudally to the pulmonary vein fat pad, cut No. 2 was made from the caudal end of cut No. 1 transversely across the sulcus terminalis to a point midway across the anterior (ventral) surface of the right atrium. Each incision was closed with 4-0 silk, with care being taken to avoid injury to either the sinoatrial nodal or the pulmonary fat pad regions. In four of seven animals, these two incisions totally interrupted vagal input to the sinoatrial node, whereas in the remaining three dogs a residual inhibitory influence remained. These residual fibers were surgically ablated by excision of globular fat pads situated on the rostrodorsal surfaces of the right superior pulmonary vein, suggesting a dorsorostral route into the interatrial septum and thence to the sinoatrial node. There was little or no interruption of either right or left vagal input to the atrioventricular nodal region; sympathetic supplies to both sinoatrial nodal and atrioventricular nodal regions remained essentially intact after the two incisions. Thus the major parasympathetic postganglionic projections to the sinoatrial node in the dog heart are by way of the free wall of the right atrium and are vulnerable to surgical interventions in this portion of the heart.\r"

Follow-up of the 224 hospital survivors was 99.6% complete. Fifty-seven valve-related events occurred. Fourteen were thrombotic events (1.2%/patient-year), 28 were intrinsic tissue failures (2.4%/patient-year), 13 were cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis (1.1%/patient-year), and 2 were paravalvular leaks (0.17%/patient-year). The linearized rate for death, reoperation, or both resulting from valve-related events was 3.6%/patient-year. Time-related hazard function for the instantaneous risk of death and/or reoperation resulting from valve-related events demonstrated an exponential increase after 80 months. These data, in conjunction with our previous reports on the histologic changes in pericardial collagen and the incidence of calcification (26/28), should be considered regarding new and future generations of pericardial bioprostheses. Although this device provides good hemodynamics and carries a low incidence of thromboembolism, it has a limited durability. New generations of pericardial valves may have improved structural features, but the behavior of glutaraldehyde-fixed, formaldehyde-stored bovine pericardium as currently selected and prepared is unlikely to change.\r"

  ".W": "From 1977 to 1987, 829 Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valves (Shiley, Inc., Irvine, Calif.) were implanted in 766 patients at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. There were 476 patients who had aortic valve replacement, 234 who had mitral valve replacement, and 44 who had double valve replacement. The standard-profile design was used in 508 patients and the low-profile design in 321 patients. Follow-up was obtained for 97% of patients, with calculation of event-free probabilities. At 10 years the overall probability of freedom from structural failure was 48% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 44% +/- 15% after mitral valve replacement, and 79% +/- 11% after double valve replacement. Although at 5 years the probability of failure was statistically lower with the low-profile design, this favorability was lost by 6 years. Freedom from structural failure was only 47% +/- 7% for the standard-profile valve at 10 years. Thus the probability of freedom from reoperation was only 46% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 39% +/- 6% after mitral valve replacement, and 65% +/- 20% after double valve replacement at 10 years. Thromboembolism occurred in 69 patients, for a predicted freedom from this complication at 10 years of 79% +/- 3% after aortic, 73% +/- 7% after mitral, and 96% +/- 4% after double valve replacement. There were 31 cases of endocarditis. The 10-year predicted freedom from endocarditis, therefore, was 86% +/- 3% after aortic, 98% +/- 1% after mitral, and 97% +/- 1% after double valve replacement. A total of 221 operative and late deaths were recorded in this series. Prosthetic valve failure accounted for 27% of late deaths. The 10-year survival rates were estimated to be 56% +/- 5% (aortic valve replacement), 54% +/- 6% (mitral valve replacement), and 51% +/- 8% (double valve replacement). We concluded that the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenograft provides less than optimal clinical performance and its use has been discontinued.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term performance of current-design porcine xenograft valves has not been satisfactory. These valves are generally fixed at \"low pressures\" of about 3 to 5 mm Hg. The Medtronic Intact (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) valve is fixed at \"zero pressure\" and is proposed as a better alternative to existing xenograft valves. A mechanical analysis of this valve has been carried out to determine if the Intact valve differs significantly from the low-pressure fixed xenograft. Twelve circumferential strips of tissue 5 mm wide were cut from the leaflets of four clinical-grade Intact valves. Their stress/strain, stress relaxation, and flexural behavior were examined mechanically and histologically. The Intact valve was more extensible than the low-pressure fixed xenograft (22% versus 12% strain, p less than 0.001), relaxed faster (p less than 0.001), and was more pliable than the xenograft (p less than 0.05). It did not, however, buckle less than did the low-pressure fixed xenograft during enforced bending, and it buckled significantly more than did fresh porcine aortic valve tissue (p less than 0.001). The Intact valve also relaxed significantly more slowly than did the fresh tissue (p less than 0.05). Its bending stiffness had a stronger dependence on leaflet thickness than the bending thickness of fresh tissue had (p less than 0.001) but a weaker dependence than the bending thickness of the low-pressure fixed xenograft material had (p less than 0.001). The Intact valve demonstrated a very large variability in extensibility, bending stiffness, and buckling behavior, with little correlation between these parameters. Some valves appeared to have wrinkled leaflets; others were likely fixed at different pressures. The shrinkage of the leaflet material at these low fixation pressures is likely important, since it can modify the elastic behavior of the valve cusps. Overall, the Intact valve had a more \"natural\" elastic behavior than had low-pressure fixed xenograft, and it should therefore experience lower stresses during normal valve function. It can be concluded that zero-pressure fixation does preserve many of the desirable stress-reducing properties of aortic valve tissue.\r"

  ".W": "In a study to determine the proportion of unrecognised cases and the prevalence of treatable complications of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 46 probands were identified through genetics and renal clinics in Melbourne, Australia. 321 offspring of the probands who were older than 15 years and had not been previously diagnosed as having ADPKD were identified. 68 (21%) had ultrasound evidence of polycystic kidney disease. Of this previously undiagnosed group, 25 (37%) had one or more treatable complications at the time of diagnosis. The complications included 20 cases of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 mm Hg or above), 7 cases of impaired renal function (serum creatinine 0.12 mmol/l or above), and 4 cases of bacterial urinary tract infection. 8 people had several complications. ADPKD has an important treatable component which is not being treated in a substantial proportion of affected individuals, because the disease is not being diagnosed despite the presence of a positive family history.\r"

Migration stimulating activity was found in the serum of 10 (83%) of 12 untreated breast cancer patients immediately before surgical resection of the primary tumour and in 9 (75%) of them 4 days after resection; in 13 (93%) of 14 patients 1-13 years after tumour resection who had received adjuvant treatment; and in 2 (10%) of 20 healthy women matched for age. The migration stimulating activity in cancer patients' serum was indistinguishable from the migration stimulating factor produced in vitro by fetal and cancer patient skin fibroblasts in its behaviour in various biochemical fractionation procedures. The presence of this activity in the serum of treated breast cancer patients clearly distinguishes it from other oncofetal proteins, which all seem to be produced by tumours.\r"

Electroencephalographic studies in 6 patients with partial and 6 with generalised seizures showed that flumazenil had a short (20 min) non-dose-dependent suppressant effect on epileptic discharges in those with partial seizures. Receptor occupancy studies in 12 patients showed that 1.5 mg flumazenil given intravenously occupied 55% receptors, whereas 15 mg occupied nearly all receptors. When 3 patients with partial seizures who had become tolerant to clonazepam were given 1.5 mg flumazenil, they were seizure-free for 6-21 days after the injection. The value of intermittent therapy with a benzodiazepine antagonist for preventing or reversing tolerance to benzodiazepine agonists ought to be investigated further.\r"

They were also tested for serum antibodies reacting with the lipopolysaccharide of E coli O157 by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting; for faecal VTEC by means of DNA probes hybridising with the genes encoding verocytotoxins VT1 and VT2; and for \"free\" faecal VT. Strains of E coli serotype O157:H7 were isolated from 9 patients, and faecal VT2 was detected in 3 of them. Strains of E coli of serotypes 05:H-, O55:H10, O105ac:H18, and O163:H19 were isolated from 4 patients, but faecal VT was not detected. Faecal VT2 was present in 1 patient from whom VTEC were not isolated. Antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide of E coli O157 were detected in serum samples from 44 patients. The 9 patients with faecal O157:H7 all had high titres of these antibodies, but serum samples from 16 healthy control children were negative. Serological testing of patients with HUS for antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide of E coli O157 provides evidence of infection with E coli O157 when faecal bacteria or VT cannot be detected.\r"

The presence and extent of costochondral enlargement was unrelated to the duration of active or cured acromegaly, the initial or present growth hormone concentrations, or other clinical features of growth hormone excess.

All isolates were susceptible to erythromycin, cefaclor, cephalothin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, rifampicin, vancomycin, and clindamycin. 29% of isolates were neither vaccine types nor vaccine-related types. Serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility varied significantly during the three winter seasons. No single serotype was found in all three winters. The findings highlight the need for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and serotype distribution of S pneumoniae in developing countries as a guide both to the choice of agent for treatment of pneumococcal infections, especially ALRI, and to the formulation of new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for use in young children.\r"

  ".W": "With the aim of improving early diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with two \"nested\" primer pairs was developed for the amplification of herpes simplex virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Southern blotting was used to confirm the specificity of the amplification. The assay was applied to 151 CSF samples from 43 consecutive patients with herpes simplex encephalitis verified by the finding of herpes simplex virus/viral antigen in a brain biopsy sample or at necropsy (13) and/or intrathecal production of IgG antibody to the virus (40). As controls, 87 CSF samples from 60 patients with acute febrile focal encephalopathy (initially suspected to be herpes simplex encephalitis but excluded by the absence of intrathecal antibody synthesis) were tested. PCR detected herpes simplex virus DNA in 42 of the 43 patients with proven herpes simplex encephalitis; all but 1 were positive in the first CSF sample taken. The 1 PCR-negative patient had been treated with acyclovir from 20 h after the onset of symptoms. All the control subjects were PCR negative, as were 270 internal contamination controls. The PCR result remained positive in samples drawn up to 27 days after the onset of neurological symptoms. This method is a rapid and non-invasive means to diagnose herpes simplex encephalitis; it is highly sensitive and specific.\r"

  ".U": "91094453\r", 
  ".W": "The therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of calcipotriol ointment and betamethasone valerate ointment in psoriasis were compared in a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, right/left trial. 345 inpatients and outpatients with psoriasis vulgaris of symmetrical distribution were treated twice daily for 6 weeks with calcipotriol ointment 50 micrograms/g and betamethasone ointment 0.1% randomly assigned to opposite sides of the body. The main outcome measures--the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), the investigators' assessments of erythema, thickness, and scaling, and the patients' own assessments of the overall response to treatment--were sought at weeks 2, 4, and 6. Both treatments significantly reduced the PASI scores and the investigator's assessment scores, but at each visit the PASI score was significantly (p less than 0.001) lower with calcipotriol than with betamethasone. At 6 weeks the mean PASI reduction was 68.8% with calcipotriol and 61.4% with betamethasone (95% confidence interval for difference 5.1-9.8, p less than 0.001). The scores for erythema, thickness, and scaling were significantly (p less than 0.001) lower with calcipotriol than with betamethasone at the end of treatment. The patients considered that 82.1% of calcipotriol-treated sides and 69.3% of betamethasone-treated sides had improved greatly or cleared up by the end of treatment (p less than 0.001). 57 adverse events were reported by 52 patients (15.1%). The most common adverse event, lesional/perilesional skin irritation, was slightly but not significantly (p = 0.12) more common with calcipotriol treatment. 15 (4.3%) patients were withdrawn from the study, 3 because of local adverse events. There were no changes in serum calcium during the study. Thus, calcipotriol ointment was superior to betamethasone valerate ointment in psoriasis vulgaris. Though long-term results are not yet available, calcipotriol holds great promise as an antipsoriatic agent.\r"

  ".W": "The potential of plasma measurement of D-dimer (DD), a specific derivative of crosslinked fibrin, for diagnosis or exclusion of pulmonary embolism was investigated in a prospective series of 171 consecutive patients who attended an emergency department with suspected pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis was made or excluded by means of a clinical decision-making process which included clinical evaluation, ventilation-perfusion (VQ) lung scan, and, as indicated, pulmonary angiography, venography, or non-invasive examination of the leg veins. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed by this process in 55 (32%) of 170 patients with sufficient data. All but 1 of these 55 patients had a DD concentration of 500 micrograms/l or above. The sensitivity and specificity of this cutoff concentration for the presence of pulmonary embolism were 98% and 39%, respectively, which give positive and negative predictive values of 44% and 98%. Among the 115 patients (68%) who had inconclusive VQ scans, 31 were diagnosed as having pulmonary embolism. 29 of the remaining 84 patients without pulmonary embolism had DD concentrations below 500 micrograms/l, which means that further diagnostic procedures could have been avoided in a quarter of the patients with inconclusive VQ scans. The sensitivity of the plasma measurement of DD remained high even 3 and 7 days after presentation (96% and 93%). Plasma measurement of DD therefore has a definite place in the diagnostic procedure for suspected acute pulmonary embolism in attenders at emergency departments: a concentration below 500 micrograms/l rules out the diagnosis.\r"

However, standard epi-illuminated, mercury vapour, fluorescence microscopes are expensive, especially for tropical countries where malaria is endemic. Fluorescence microscopy with a standard light microscope and a new interference filter specially designed for the fluorochrome stain, acridine orange, was used to detect malaria parasites in thick and thin bloodfilms. In this system two fluorescence colours, green (nuclei) and red (cytoplasm), were emitted from stained parasites. Thick and thin bloodfilms from patients with malaria were examined with this system. Bloodfilms had been fixed and stored for 1-5 years. Rapid scanning of both thick and thin bloodfilms was possible at a magnification of x200 with standard lenses, indicating that this may be a useful economic system for rapid diagnosis of malarias.\r"

We postulate that these diverse stimuli trigger a cutaneous inflammatory response by directly inducing epidermal keratinocytes to elaborate specific pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. The consequences are activation of dermal microvascular endothelial cells and selective accumulation of specific mononuclear cells in the dermis and epidermis. Thus, keratinocytes may act as \"signal transducers\", capable of converting exogenous stimuli into the production of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and chemotactic factors (acting in an autocrine and paracrine fashion) responsible for initiation of \"antigen-independent\" cutaneous inflammation. The initiation phase may facilitate or promote an amplification phase with additional production of tumour-necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma via an \"antigen-dependent\" pathway, and keratinocyte/T cell/antigen-presenting dendritic cellular associations. The direct activation of keratinocytes, with their ability to produce the complete repertoire of pro-inflammatory cytokines, can profoundly influence endogenous and recruited immunocompetent cells, thereby providing the critical trigger responsible for the swift and clinically dramatic alterations that occur following contact between the epidermis and a host of \"noxious\" agents.\r"

Since this method allows measurement of the inherent difficulty of carrying out a particular assessment, it has wide applicability in the introduction of new technology. If a proportion of agreement study shows poor inter-observer agreement for a new method, the technology must either be improved or abandoned.\r"

For spurious reasons they regard axillary clearance as unnecessarily extensive surgery and rely instead upon total mastectomy or tumour excision and node sampling, with or without postoperative radiotherapy. But it is now clear that relapse-free and overall survival can be improved by appropriate adjuvant therapy. Thus inadequate exploration of the axilla is doubly unjustified. Not only is there the obvious risk of failure to remove nodes that contain metastases--so that some patients are deprived of cure by primary treatment--but the extent of tumour spread will be inadequately assessed in many more patients, with the risk that they may not receive appropriate adjuvant treatment.\r"
