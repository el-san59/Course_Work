Review of our experience with 26 patients over 12 years ending in 1986 substantiated a concept previously advocated by other authors that ranulas are usually extravasation pseudocysts developing after disruption of sublingual gland elements, and that excision of the ipsilateral sublingual gland is the management approach of choice.\r"

  ".W": "The controversy surrounding the various approaches to palate repair continues unabated. Issues which have been studied relative to the development of normal speech following palate repair have included surgical technique and the timing of surgery. However, regardless of the various refinements in surgery, a percentage of children require secondary surgery to resolve velopharyngeal insufficiency. To date, other factors which might be responsible for the development of normal speech have been ignored. The purpose of this report is to discuss the importance of the relative size of the adenoids in relation to the success or failure of primary palatoplasty. Velopharyngeal valving in noncleft (normal) children was also observed. Eight hundred fifty children with nonsyndromic clefts and 138 children with syndromic clefts were analyzed for speech results postpalatoplasty relative to adenoid size. One hundred normal children were also studied. The data suggest a strongly positive correlation between the incidence of hypernasal resonance postpalatoplasty and relative adenoid size in the cleft children. Velar-adenoidal closure was consistently observed in both the cleft and normal children.\r"

Twelve hundred eighty cases of mastoid surgery were performed at Ghaem Medical Center and the author's private clinic between January 1978 and December 1985 in Mashad, Iran. In sixteen cases, surgically proven sigmoid sinus involvement was due to a bone eroding process of chronic ear infection.

The derived data clearly identify the unpredictable response of these tumors to radiation and supports our contention that surgery is the preferred form of treatment for temporal paragangliomas even after radiation therapy. Analysis of clinical histories reveals that previous radiation therapy is associated with a greater operative blood loss and a longer mean postoperative hospital stay due to delayed healing. Despite this, there was no mortality or serious morbidity from surgery.\r"

Patients are monitored throughout the procedure with end-tidal CO2 levels and a cutaneous oximeter. Surgery is performed without the impediment of an endotracheal tube. This method, used in 240 patients ranging in age from 3 months to 18 years, eliminates the danger of a laser fire, gives an unobstructed view of the larynx, is safe, and is free of complications.

The modified technique described provides an alternative method of bringing a vascularized rib graft to an irradiated field for mandibular reconstruction avoiding multiple rib resections and microvascular anastomosis. This technique has been used in two patients who had anterior mandibular resection and irradiation therapy for advanced squamous cell carcinoma. The results from this technique were excellent and without major complications.\r"

Eight males performed four, 60-min exercise bouts using either arm or leg ergometry in ambient temperatures of 23 degrees C (relative humidity = 75%) and 33 degrees C (relative humidity = 57%). Power output was 75 W for all experiments. Oxygen consumption, rectal and skin temperatures, heart rate (HR), and rating of perceived exertion were measured during exercise. Exercise oxygen consumption averaged 1.54 l.min-1 across all experiments and was equivalent to 60% of arm and 37% of leg peak values. Rectal temperature increased (P less than 0.001) an average of 0.43 degrees C and did not differ due to experimental conditions. Exercise performed in the heat resulted in higher skin temperature (P less than 0.001), regardless of whether the arms or legs were used. HR and rating of perceived exertion were greater (P less than 0.001) in arm (132.9 b.min-1, 14.4 units) than leg (108.9 b.min-1, 10.9 units) experiments. When arm exercise was performed in the heat, HR was 6 b.min-1 greater than when performed in the cool. Greater relative exercise intensity in arm work resulted in higher HR and rating of perceived exertion at the given power output. Similar rectal temperature increases in all experiments indicate that core temperature is controlled by absolute heat production, regardless of mode of exercise and ambient temperature.\r"

High and reproducible correlations (r's = 0.82 to 0.87) between the re-call and a concurrent 7-d diary were observed, and re-call effectively classified subjects into highly active (greater than or equal to 280 kcal.kg-1.wk-1) and inactive (less than 245 kcal.kg-1.wk-1) groups. Significant correlations between re-call and a psychometric predictor of physical activity (self-motivation) were also robust across samples and consistent with those seen when direct measures of activity have been used. Increases in time and distance records for supervised running were accompanied by increases in total and vigorous re-call, but not in moderate re-call, supporting the re-call's sensitivity to measured changes in group activity levels. Re-call was not, however, highly correlated with supervised running, and this is consistent with its use as a measure of free-living activity. Re-call was also not spuriously contaminated by response distortion or attitudinal variables, and intra-class reliability for repeated assessments of total (PI = 0.89) and vigorous (PI = 0.90) re-call was high across 7 wk. Finally, re-call provided a better estimate of a 7-d diary than did practical bio-behavioral estimates of habitual activity (12-min run and skinfold thickness), and re-call was highly correlated with a concurrent physical activity questionnaire (r's = 0.83 to 0.94) and VO2max (ml.kg-1.min-1) (r = 0.61). Our results are consistent with previous studies on community-based adult populations; they support that the 7-d re-call is reliable and valid for college students when compared with concurrent bio-behavioral and self-report estimates of physical activity.\r"

Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured during two levels of sub-maximal and during a maximal treadmill performance test. All of the solutions, including water, were equally effective in maintaining water and mineral balances, and moderate physical performance while the men were consuming an adequate all liquid diet. All of the solutions containing carbohydrates increased respiratory exchange ratios. These increases were significant during maximal performance for only two of the commercial products. These two products also produced the higher values for most of the performance evaluations, although they were not generally significantly different from values obtained while other solutions or water were consumed. The major benefit of these commercial sport drinks are their prevention of hypohydration due to an increase in voluntary fluid intakes.\r"

A supervised exercise session at 60% peak VO2 took place 3 times.wk-1 for 30 to 45 min. Peak VO2 and exercise endurance tests were repeated during the fourth week of the VLCD. One week of a 4,186 kJ (1000 kcal) diet followed the VLCD. The average weekly weight loss was 1.7 +/- 0.1 kg for the HC group and 2.0 +/- 0.2 kg for the LC group. Urinary nitrogen loss was greater for the LC group early in the VLCD but not different than HC over the entire experimental period. Serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol decreased in both groups but the ratio of these lipids improved over the treatment. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate and uric acid increased significantly more for the LC than the HC group. Although absolute peak VO2 decreased, VO2 relative to body weight was maintained. Time to exhaustion improved by 36% for both groups in the endurance exercise tests. The endurance exercise R ratio was significantly more depressed by the LC than the HC treatment. In summary, both supervised treatments were effective in causing substantial weight reduction and improved blood lipid profiles in healthy young women but caused a net loss of body protein. Neither treatment compromised ability to participate in a thrice weekly exercise program. Although peak aerobic capacity did not increase, aerobic endurance at a fixed sub-maximal exercise load was improved.\r"

Rats were exercised for 60 min, 5 d.wk-1 for 8 to 10 wk, at a speed of 27 m.min-1 and with a grade of 8%. Sedentary (N = 9) and exercised (N = 8) rats were given food and water ad libitum. Oxygen consumption was measured at rest and following the ingestion of a meal consisting of 81% carbohydrate, 9% protein, and 10% fat (by calories). In those animals that were exercised, oxygen consumption measurements were performed 24 h after the completion of an exercise bout. Although all animals gained weight during the experimental period, the exercised group gained significantly less than did the sedentary rats. Resting oxygen consumption [ml/(min X g body mass.67)] was not significantly different between the exercised and sedentary rats. The ingestion of the high carbohydrate meal significantly increased mass-independent oxygen consumption above resting values in both groups; the values for the exercised rats were greater than those for the sedentary rats. However, there were no differences between the exercised and sedentary rats in meal-induced oxygen consumption when the data were expressed as a function of lean body mass [ml/(min X g lean body mass)] or as mass-independent lean body mass [ml/(min X g lean body mass.67)]. These data suggest that exercise-trained rats have increased diet-induced thermogenesis and may be one factor in the loss of weight sometimes found in response to exercise.\r"

In series 1, 6 subjects (age 19 to 23 yr) cycled at 120% VO2max for 1 min followed by 4 min recovery until fatigue or until 24 repetitions had been completed. In series 2, 7 subjects (age 19 to 25 yr) cycled continuously at 65% VO2max for 2 h. In both experiments, short-term training was performed by repeating the exercise protocol for three consecutive days. In series 1, a progressive increase of 40% (P less than 0.05) was observed on day 1 in plasma uric acid concentration over the duration of the exercise. On day 2, pre-exercise values remained elevated over day 1 (mean +/- SD, 476 +/- 77 vs 352 +/- 30 mumol.l-1) and showed a further 23% increase (P less than 0.05) with exercise. Although resting uric acid concentrations on day 3 were elevated (P less than 0.05) over day 1, the exercise levels between day 1 and day 3 were not different (P greater than 0.05). In contrast, in series 2, prolonged sub-maximal exercise failed to stimulate increases in uric acid concentration either between days or within days. It is concluded that exercise intensity rather than total work output is a critical factor mediating increases in blood uric acid concentration. These results are consistent with the interpretation that uric acid formation may arise from purine nucleotide degradation and fast-twitch fiber utilization during conditions of high energy utilization.\r"

Occupational physical activity in Belgians and heavy leisure time activity in Slovakians were independently related to fitness levels. However, each activity score explained less than 1% of the variance of physical fitness. We conclude that in these mainly sedentary, middle-aged subjects, fitness levels are independent from the usual physical activity patterns.\r"

Testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, and cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay in resting blood samples (8 h fast) collected every 60 min for 4 h. The endurance-trained group had been active for (mean +/- SE) 12.4 +/- 6.7 yr, 6.6 +/- 0.2 d.wk-1, 68.5 +/- 4.4 min.d-1, while the untrained group was sedentary. Neither group had histories of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular disorders. The overall 4 h mean testosterone and free testosterone levels were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in the trained group (4.99 +/- 0.46 vs 7.25 +/- 0.67 ng.ml-1, and 17.2 +/- 1.4 vs 23.6 +/- 0.6 pg.ml-1, for the trained and untrained groups, respectively). The LH of the endurance-trained group was higher (15.3 +/- 1.9 vs 11.7 +/- 1.2 mIU.ml-1, P = 0.06); however, LH pulse frequency and amplitude did not differ between groups. An enhanced estradiol feedback to the hypothalamus-pituitary could not account for the elevated LH, as estradiol levels were similar in the groups. Prolactin and cortisol levels were normal and did not differ between groups. The results suggested normal hypothalamic-pituitary function existed in the trained subjects, and prolactin and cortisol were not causative factors in the lowered resting testosterone and free testosterone levels. The findings indicate that chronic endurance training lowers testosterone and free testosterone in males possibly by impairing testicular function.\r"

Ninety-five males (25.6 +/- 4.9 yr) and 87 females (22.6 +/- 5.2 yr) were studied at two laboratory sites using identical protocols. Twenty males and 20 females were separated from the original group and randomly assigned to cross-validation groups. RVs were determined by the oxygen dilution method. Vital capacity was determined with the subject submerged in water to the shoulders. Underwater weight was determined using 10 trials at RV and 5 trials at TLCNS, with the order of methods randomly assigned. Regression analysis provided an equation to predict body density (pDb) at RV from body density (Db) at TLCNS. The equation for males was pDb (HW at RV) = 0.5829 (DbHW at TLCNS) + 0.4059, r = 0.88, SEE = 0.0067. The equation for females was pDb (HW at RV) = 0.4745 (DbHW at TLCNS) + 0.5173, r = 0.85, SEE = 0.0061. Cross-validation showed no significant differences using Db from HW at RV (males = 1.0626 g.ml-1, females = 1.0493 g.ml-1 and pDb from HW at TLCNS (males = 1.0625 g.ml-1, females = 1.0479 g.ml-1).

  ".W": "Eight wheelchair sportsmen conducted eight wheelchair exercise tests on a treadmill. Two workload strategies were followed: strategy 1--increments in speed at a constant slope and strategy 2--increments in slope at constant velocity. Thus, data on cardio-respiratory and propulsion technique parameters were obtained on two identical series of 16 speed and slope combinations. Between each two identical speed and slope combinations of strategies 1 and 2, a different workload history is apparent. A four-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures on the factors \"strategy\" (workload history), \"speed,\" and \"slope\" was applied (P less than 0.05). No \"strategy\" effect was seen in the cardio-respiratory parameters (gross mechanical efficiency, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and heart rate), work/cycle, and cycle time. Thus, within the experimental set-up, workload history did not affect the parameters studied and 3-min workload periods appeared sufficiently long for experienced wheelchair users to adapt to the requirements of a given speed and slope combination. Significant effects were found on \"speed,\" \"slope,\" and their interaction in all parameters tested. Moreover, a comparison of two equal levels of power output, but different speed and slope, led to a significantly higher efficiency, cycle time, and work per cycle for the \"low speed and high slope\" combination. Push time and recovery time appeared highly dependent on speed and slope, respectively. The findings indicate that propulsion technique and cardio-respiratory parameters should not merely be studied in relation to power output, but also with respect to its constituents, speed, and slope/resistance.\r"

Subjects performed a series of five isometric contractions at 10% maximum voluntary contraction step intervals. Pre- and post-fatigue surface electromyograms for the muscles were rectified, integrated, normalized, a representative equation determined using the least-squares method, and the equations numerically differentiated. The differentiated curves represent the change of excitation (and therefore, change of isometric torque) with respect to the change in resultant torque (dIEMG/dT). Pre-fatigue synergy, as indicated by the dIEMG/dT, was characterized by both co-activation and trade-off patterns. The nature of the synergy was changed as a result of fatigue. This technique, focusing upon synergistic patterns, quantifies differences in excitation profiles in a manner not previously described.\r"

  ".W": "Current footwear which are designed for use in running are examples of intentional biomechanical model integration into device design. The inadequacy of this footwear in protecting against injury is postulated to be due to fixation on inadequate models of locomotory biomechanics that do not provide for feedback control; in particular, an hypothesized plantar surface sensory-mediated feedback control system, which imparts overload protection during locomotion. A heuristic approach was used to identify the hypothesized system. A random series of loads (0 to 164 kg) was applied to the knee flexed at 90 degrees. In this testing system, plantar surface avoidance behavior was the difference between the sum of the leg weight and the load applied to the knee, and the load measured at the plantar surface; this was produced by activation of hip flexors. Significant avoidance behavior was found in all of the subjects (P less than 0.001). On all surfaces tested, including modern athletic footwear (P less than 0.001), its magnitude increased directly in relation to the load applied to the knee (P less than 0.001). There were significant differences in avoidance behavior in relation to the weight-bearing surfaces tested (P less than 0.05). With the identification of a feedback control system which would serve to moderate loading during locomotion, an explanation is provided as to why current athletic footwear do not protect and may be injurious; thus allowing the design of footwear which may be truly protective.\r"

  ".W": "This paper compares the effects of 6 wk of sub-maximal training by electrostimulation (100 Hz) and voluntary contractions on the contractile properties of the adductor pollicis muscle in intact man. The daily training program consisted of ten series of twenty 1-s isotonic contractions (60 to 65% of maximum) separated by 1-s intervals. The observed increase in muscle force, tested in maximal voluntary and electrically evoked contractions, appears to be significantly smaller during electrostimulation than during a training session performed by voluntary contractions. The increase in force recorded during electrostimulation is not associated with changes in the tetanus rates of tension development and tension relaxation (dP0/dt). Conversely, the tetanus time course is found to be significantly accelerated in muscles trained by voluntary contractions. No change of the surface action potential total area was observed during both training procedures. Furthermore, electrostimulation does not improve muscle resistance to fatigue, which is observed to be significantly increased after training by voluntary contractions. This study indicates that electrostimulation augments the muscle force of contraction by changing peripheral processes associated with intra-cellular events, without modifying the nervous command of the contraction. The comparison of the peripheral changes recorded during sub-maximal training by electrostimulation and voluntary contractions suggests that electrostimulation is less efficient, but complementary to voluntary training because the number and the type of trained motor units are different in the two procedures.\r"

The clinical picture led to an initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease in all cases, but nerve conduction studies revealed multifocal conduction block confined to motor axons and predominantly involving proximal nerve segments. Routine sensory nerve conduction studies, ascending compound nerve action potentials, and somatosensory evoked potentials were all normal even through nerve segments in which motor conduction was severely blocked. Onset of symptoms was insidious, and progression was indolent. In two cases, after many years of neuropathy, sensory abnormalities developed but remained clinically trivial. These unusual cases probably have the same pathogenesis as previously described patients with persistent multifocal conduction block. Distinction from motor neuron disease is critical, since chronic demyelinating neuropathy may respond to treatment.\r"

To determine when these characteristic proteins are expressed during development, samples from canine temporalis (masticatory) and pectineus (limb) muscles were compared between 55 days gestation and 60 days postpartum by histochemical, biochemical, and immunocytochemical analysis. At 55 days gestation and 3 days postpartum, both muscles contained identical histochemical type 2C fibers, native myosin isozymes, and myosin light and heavy chains. By 14 days postpartum, fiber-type expression in these muscles diverged, with resultant formation of type 1 and type 2M fibers in the temporalis muscle and type 1 and 2A fibers in the pectineus muscle. The distinctive myosin isoforms, light chains, and heavy chain of the temporalis muscle were also expressed 2 weeks postpartum. Based on the methods used in this study, we conclude that (1) the temporalis muscle develops from embryonic fibers that initially contain a myosin indistinguishable from embryonic limb muscle fibers, suggesting they have a common precursor, and (2) the myosin light chains and heavy chain unique to the temporalis muscle are initially expressed 2 weeks postpartum.\r"

A shortcoming of most protocols is determining the precise radial nerve length as it proceeds along the spiral groove. The present study dissected out and measured directly eight cadaver radial nerves from the axilla to the elbow. These values were compared with a new surface tape measurement technique from axilla to elbow across the bicep muscle, obstetrical calipers over this region, and a surface determination approximating the course of the radial nerve posteriorly in the spiral groove. The anterior surface tape-measuring procedure compared most favorably with the actual anatomic length. Nerve conduction velocities were then calculated in 20 volunteers using all 3 techniques and compared with the median nerve in the arm. The anterior and posterior tape measurements yielded a conduction velocity of 72.5 +/- 4.7 and 86.6 +/- 7.0 m/s, respectively, whereas the caliper resulted in 65.7 +/- 3.9 m/s. We conclude that proximal radial nerve length assessment employing an anterior tape measurement from axilla to elbow across the bicep musculature is precise and compares favorably with the actual anatomic length of the radial nerve.\r"

After determining the recruitment threshold and the twitch tension (spike-triggered averaging) of a single unit, its nerve was stimulated at the wrist and the elbow using surface electrodes. By adjusting the position of the surface electrode and the stimulus intensity and by using computerized subtraction of responses just above and below threshold for a given unit, the same motor unit could often be identified in response to stimulation at both sites and its conduction velocity determined. The twitch tension and recruitment threshold of the motor units were closely correlated with the conduction velocity of the motor axons in normal subjects. Preliminary data from patients suggests that this method should be applicable to patients with a number of neuromuscular disorders.\r"

The area and duration of the simulated MUAPs were affected by all muscle fibers in front of the active recording surface but mainly by those that were less than 2 and 2.5 mm, respectively, from the active recording surface. The MUAP area was also affected by the proximity of the electrode to the closest muscle fiber. The number of phases of the simulated MUAPs increased when the dispersion of the arrival times of individual muscle fiber APs at the electrode was increased. Increased temporal dispersion of APs decreased the MUAP amplitude and area slightly but did not affect the MUAP duration. It is inferred that different features of the CN MUAP are determined by the distribution of muscle fibers within different portions of the MU territory and thus provide complementary information about the MU architecture.\r"

In 6 of the 15 asymptomatic relatives, the surface EMG results were also abnormal. It is concluded that the MFCV is reduced in familial HOPP. This results in a predominantly low-frequency content of the power spectra, thereby providing a new model for studying the relationship between the MFCV and the frequency spectrum of surface EMG. Asymptomatic relatives that have inherited the disease probably can be detected with this method.\r"

We stimulated 29 normal subjects with a transcranial high voltage (300-500 V), short duration spike waveform (time constant 50 mu sec) and recorded over the hypothenar or calf muscles. F wave and M response latencies were used to estimate peripheral conduction time. The mean MC/C8 conduction time was 4.4 +/- 0.6 msec. Out of 26 subjects tested, 14 had discernable responses in the calf. The mean MC/S1 conduction time was 13.1 +/- 2.5 msec, and the mean estimated C8/S1 conduction time was 8.5 +/- 2.3 msec. This technique accurately measures conduction time from the motor cortex to the cervical anterior horn cells but is less reliable for monitoring conduction to the sacral cord. These values will facilitate future studies in patients with suspected lesions of the descending motor pathways.\r"

  ".W": "By means of proton MRI, the spin-lattice relaxation times (T1 values) of pelvic and leg muscles were measured in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and normal controls. The bound water fraction (BWF) was calculated from the T1 value obtained. In normal children, the T1 value decreased, and BWF increased with age. In DMD, the T1 value rapidly decreased, from an abnormally high value in the early stages, with the progress of the disease. This reduction of the T1 value in DMD was not the same for all muscles; it was most prominent in the gluteus maximus and least prominent in the sartorius and gracilis muscles. BWF was below normal in the early stages of DMD. It is suggested that both regenerating and degenerating muscle fibers, together with the increased muscle water content, cause the high T1 value and low BWF in the early stages of DMD, whereas replacement of muscle by fat causes the decreased T1 value in the advanced stages.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the use of the urinary anion gap (sodium plus potassium minus chloride) in assessing hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in 38 patients with altered distal urinary acidification and in 8 patients with diarrhea. In seven normal subjects given ammonium chloride for three days, the anion gap was negative (-27 +/- 9.8 mmol per liter) and the urinary pH under 5.3 (4.9 +/- 0.03). In the eight patients with diarrhea the anion gap was also negative (-20 +/- 5.7 mmol per liter), even though the urinary pH was above 5.3 (5.64 +/- 0.14). In contrast, the anion gap was positive in all patients with altered urinary acidification, who were classified as having classic renal tubular acidosis (23 +/- 4.1 mmol per liter, 11 patients), hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis (30 +/- 4.2, 12 patients), or selective aldosterone deficiency (39 +/- 4.2, 15 patients). When the data on all subjects studied were pooled, a negative correlation was found between the urinary ammonium level and the urinary anion gap. We conclude that the use of the urinary anion gap, as a rough index of urinary ammonium, may be helpful in the initial evaluation of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. A negative anion gap suggests gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate, whereas a positive anion gap suggests the presence of altered distal urinary acidification.\r"

  ".U": "88143004\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that complete catch-up growth is achieved with treatment in patients with juvenile acquired hypothyroidism. We tested this assumption by examining long-term growth in 18 girls (mean [+/- SD] age, 11.4 +/- 2.7 years; bone age, 6.2 +/- 3.1 years) and 6 boys (age, 10.6 +/- 4.7 years; bone age, 6.4 +/- 2.7 years) with severe primary hypothyroidism (serum thyroxine level 1.1 +/- 0.3 micrograms per deciliter [13 +/- 4 nmol per liter]). At diagnosis, heights were 4.04 +/- 0.5 and 3.15 +/- 0.4 SD below the mean heights for age of normal girls and boys, respectively. The patients were treated with levothyroxine (3.4 +/- 0.3 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day) to maintain normal thyroid function. During the first 18 months of therapy, the children's skeletal maturation exceeded the maturation expected for their statural growth, regardless of whether or not they were undergoing pubertal development. Predictions of decreased adult height were based on these observations. At maturity, girls and boys stood approximately 2 SD below normal adult stature, at 149 +/- 5.0 cm and 168 +/- 5.1 cm, respectively. Heights at maturity were also lower than midparental heights (P less than 0.01) and lower than pre-illness standard-deviation scores for height (P less than 0.01). The deficit in adult stature was significantly related to the duration of hypothyroidism before treatment (P less than 0.01). We conclude that despite treatment, prolonged juvenile acquired hypothyroidism results in a permanent height deficit related to the duration of thyroxine deficiency before treatment.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed 1808 hospital charts representing virtually all patients given a diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer in New Hampshire and Vermont between 1973 and 1976 and found that the treatment of patients varied according to their marital status, medical insurance coverage, and proximity to a cancer-treatment center. Patients were more likely to be treated with surgery if they were married (odds ratio, 1.67; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.57) or had private medical insurance (1.52; 1.03 to 2.26). Among patients who did not have surgery, those with private insurance were more likely to receive another form of anticancer therapy--either radiation or chemotherapy (1.57; 1.18 to 2.09). Residing farther from a cancer-treatment center was associated with a greater chance of having surgery. Patients 75 years of age and older were less likely to have surgery (0.16; 0.08 to 0.35) or any other tumor-directed therapy (0.32; 0.19 to 0.54). The relation between the type of treatment and a patient's characteristics was not based on apparent differences in tumor stage or functional status, although both these factors were also strongly predictive of the type of treatment. Despite the fact that privately insured and married patients were more aggressively treated, they did not survive longer after diagnosis. We conclude that for non-small-cell lung cancer, socio-economic as well as medical factors determine treatment.\r"

We have reexamined this issue by using two independent molecular genetic methods. We report tumor-cell-specific restriction-fragment-length alterations involving the parathyroid hormone gene from two human parathyroid adenomas. These abnormal restriction fragments indicate that in each case a clonal proliferation of cells was present and also suggest that DNA alterations involving the parathyroid hormone locus may be important in the tumorigenesis or clonal evolution of some parathyroid adenomas. In addition, we used a restriction-fragment-length polymorphism in an X-linked gene (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase) to examine the clonality of eight parathyroid adenomas in women. Of these eight adenomas, six had the DNA hybridization pattern of monoclonality, and two had an equivocal pattern. None of five hyperplastic parathyroid glands had a monoclonal pattern. We conclude that some (and perhaps many) single parathyroid adenomas are monoclonal neoplasms. Our observations suggest that there is a fundamental biologic difference between parathyroid adenomas and primary hyperplasia--a difference that could prove useful in distinguishing these entities clinically.\r"

We detected major malformations in the infants of 4.9 percent of the early-entry diabetic women, 2.1 percent of the controls, and 9.0 percent of the late-entry diabetic women. Malformation rates were significantly higher among offspring of early-entry diabetic women than among those of controls (odds ratio, 2.45; lower one-sided 95 percent confidence limit, 1.12; P = 0.027), and higher among late-entry than among early-entry diabetic women (odds ratio, 1.91; lower one-sided 95 percent confidence limit, 1.07; P = 0.032). Mean blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels during organogenesis were not significantly higher in women whose infants were malformed. Hypoglycemia (glucose, less than or equal to 50 mg per deciliter [2.8 mmol per liter]) was not significantly more common in the same group. Hyperglycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin were not correlated with malformation. The data suggest that more sensitive measures are needed to identify the teratogenic mechanisms, or that not all malformation can be prevented by good glycemic control. Despite the increased malformation rate among infants of the early-entry diabetic women, as compared with the controls, the more favorable outcome seen in the former group as compared with the late-entry group justifies the attempt to achieve good metabolic control around the time of conception.\r"

We sent questionnaires to the 1007 members of the Perinatal Pediatrics Section of the American Academy of Pediatrics to determine their views on the Baby Doe regulations and on whether the regulations had affected their practices; 494 of the members (49 percent) responded. Of the respondents, 76 percent believed that the current regulations were not necessary to protect the rights of handicapped infants; 66 percent believed that the regulations interfered with parents' right to determine what course of action was in the best interest of their children; and 60 percent believed that the regulations did not allow adequate consideration of infants' suffering. In responding to the three hypothetical cases of severely handicapped newborns, up to 32 percent of the respondents said that maximal life-prolonging treatment was not in the best interests of the infants described but that the Baby Doe regulations required such treatment. The responding neonatologists' concerns about the current Baby Doe regulations were similar to those expressed by the United States Supreme Court in rejecting an earlier set of Baby Doe regulations. This similarity suggests that the current Baby Doe regulations should be reevaluated.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most controversial issues in primate palaeontology concerns the phylogenetic position of the extinct primate infraorder Adapiformes. During the Eocene, this group of primates of modern aspect possessed a holarctic distribution, and may have been present in the poorly known Palaeogene of Africa. Mainly on the basis of craniodental morphology, at least four hypotheses have been proposed concerning the phylogenetic interrelationships among adapiforms and other primate higher taxa: (1) that adapiforms are ancestral to both lemuriforms (including Lorisoidea) and anthropoids; (2) that adapiforms cannot be shown to possess a special phylogenetic relationship with either lemuriforms or anthropoids; (3) that adapiforms are the sister taxon of lemuriforms; and (4) that Adapiformes is not a natural, monophyletic group, but rather consists of nested clades within the radiation of lemuriforms. Here, we describe features of the ankle and wrist joints of several adapiform taxa that provide an independent test of the preceding hypotheses. These traits suggest that lemuriforms are monophyletic with respect to known adapiforms, but that adapiforms nevertheless are their stem lineage (sensu Ax).\r"

The Leydig cells then secrete androgen which stimulates the development of the male reproductive tract, and the Sertoli cells secrete Mullerian inhibitory substance which inhibits the development of the female reproductive tract. In the absence of a testis, the Mullerian duct develops into the Fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina. Thus the whole of sexual differentiation is thought to be hormonally mediated as a consequence of this initial genetic determination of gonadal sex. We have found evidence in a marsupial mammal for extensive sexual dimorphisms which precede any morphological differentiation of the gonads. Thus the classical view of mammalian sexual differentiation may have over-emphasized the role of testicular hormones, and overlooked earlier genetic effects.\r"

These are clusters of transmembrane channels by which the fibre cells situated deeper in the lens communicate through the epithelium with the aqueous humour, the source of nutrients for the lens. Hence gap junctions are important for lens transparency. The gap junction proteins in the mammalian lens have not yet been identified with certainty. A putative fibre gap junction protein of relative molecular mass 26,000 (26K) is not related to those from other tissues, such as the liver 28K junction component. Another lens membrane protein with Mr 70K (MP70) has also been localized in the lens fibre gap junctions. Here we demonstrate by amino-terminal sequence analysis that MP70 and its in vivo-processed form, MP38 (ref. 8), belong to a wider family of gap junction proteins. With this new data on the lens, homologies between gap junction proteins now extend to organs derived from all three embryonal layers, endoderm (liver), mesoderm (heart) and ectoderm (lens).\r"

  ".W": "A molecular description of haemoglobin's cooperative oxygen binding and release was founded on the X-ray crystal structures of the deoxy-T and oxy-R states. Since the R state's oxygen affinity is close to that of an isolated subunit, the crucial allosteric phenomena are (1) the reduced affinity of the T state and (2) the kinetic pathway between the two quaternary structures. To investigate these phenomena directly, we have determined at high resolution (dmin = 2.1 A) the crystal structures of two liganded T-state haemoglobins. In the liganded T-state alpha subunit, both the tight packing of the haem and the intersubunit contacts inhibit a conformational change between the F helix and FG corner which would allow the haem to become planar and the iron to assume symmetrical R-like coordination. In the beta subunit, by contrast, we find no strain on the proximal side, but the intersubunit contacts prevent the haem from tilting about an axis parallel to the F helix which would open up the binding site to oxygen. In both subunits, ligand binding in the T state induces structural changes towards the tertiary conformation of the R state.\r"

We also sought to determine whether placing two spinal needles, two epidural catheters, or two Cordis CSF catheters per patient provides more effective removal of CSF than placing one such CSF drain. Spinal needles were associated with a higher incidence of fresh blood in the CSF when CSF removal was desired, a lower incidence of adequate volume of CSF drainage, and a higher incidence of the need to reposition needles to continue CSF removal. Epidural catheters were associated with a lower incidence of adequate rate of CSF drainage. The slow rate of CSF drainage with epidural catheters was clinically important because it impaired operative conditions, delayed surgical progress, or both. Cordis CSF catheters took longer to place than spinal needles or epidural catheters. This time difference (about 3 minutes for one CSF catheter and 6 minutes for two) was statistically significant, but probably is not clinically important. The results were similar whether one or two CSF drains were used per patient. It is concluded that Cordis CSF catheters are more effective than spinal needles or epidural catheters for intraoperative removal of CSF. Using two spinal needles, two epidural catheters, or two Cordis CSF catheters per patient did not provide better CSF removal than using one such drain.\r"

Such a fatal complication, the first one associated with the technique of percutaneous trigeminal compression, was perhaps predisposed by preexistent cerebral atrophy with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces; the unforeseen piercing of the dilated trigeminal cistern probably permitted the intracranial subarachnoid diffusion of an otherwise trivial hemorrhage.

The vasculature and the degree of capillary permeability varied widely, depending mainly on the size of the glioma, and were often heterogeneous even in the same tumor. The distribution of boron-10 also varied, correlating to capillary permeability. The boron-10 concentration and the tumor:blood concentration ratio in large and medium-sized gliomas were adequate for successful BNCT.

The investigative method described herein is the means being used to define that relationship in humans. It is a postmortem study that focuses on unruptured aneurysms. Central to the protocol was a synthetic rubber cast of the aneurysm's interior. The cast was made under normal arterial pressure so that unruptured aneurysms were reexpanded to lifelike size and shape. After the cast was removed intact from the specimen, the lumenal features recorded upon it were verified by comparison with the opened aneurysm. Working now only with the cast, the chamber was cut from the artery through its neck. The orifice area was determined by dividing it, mathematically, into many smaller, measurable forms. Chamber volume was ascertained by a fluid displacement technique. Both measurements were made with magnification and engineering instruments. Casts of ruptured or thrombosed aneurysms gave helpful morphological information, but were of limited value for measurement. The techniques are described, and examples of the initial results are presented.\r"

  ".W": "Having previously studied a static load model of cord injury in rats, we report here an evaluation of a dynamic (weight drop) technique. Under general anesthesia, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a laminectomy at T12, after which a 10-g weight was dropped onto a force transducer and impounder resting on the spinal cord; the weight drop distances varied in different groups from 0 (control) in increments of 2.5 cm to a maximal height of 17.5 cm. A strain gauge attached to the force transducer yielded an oscilloscopic wave form from which force of impact (peak force and impulse) was calculated. Eighty-six animals were used in this parametric study. The animals were observed for 4 weeks postinjury with two tests of motor recovery (Tarlov score for locomotion and the inclined plane test). After sacrifice at 4 weeks, the spinal cords were removed and, with the use of preset criteria, qualitative histopathological scoring of the extent of tissue damage was carried out. We found that the variable height of weight drop was capable of producing a graded injury that correlated with the force of injury (as measured by the force transducer) and with the outcome parameters of functional recovery and degree of morphological damage in the spinal cord. Histopathologically, there was a tendency to central cavitation of the cord. Both the static load and the dynamic load techniques seem to be valid models of spinal cord injury. Pathologically, however, the tissue damage after static load injury involved primarily the dorsal half of the cord. By contrast, the dynamic load technique produced central cavitation comparable to that observed in human spinal cord injury. In this respect, the dynamic model seems to be superior and its use is therefore recommended for studies of therapeutic intervention for spinal cord injury.\r"

To our knowledge, these agents have not been previously tested in a contusion model of cord injury in which neurological outcome is one of the critical outcome parameters. We carried out preliminary behavioral toxicity testing to identify a range of low, moderate, and high dosage levels of the calcium channel blocker, nicardipine; these dosage levels were to be used subsequently in formal testing. After laminectomy at T8 under general anesthesia in rats, a 10-g weight was dropped from a height of 5 cm onto the spinal cord. The animals were randomly assigned to four groups: control or one of three nicardipine treatment groups: (a) low dose (1 mg/kg, followed by a continuous 23-hour infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/hour), (b) moderate dose (10 mg/kg, followed by 5 mg/kg/hour for 23 hours, and (c) high dose (20 mg/kg, followed by 23-hour infusion of 10 mg/kg/hour). Functional recovery was tested over the course of 4 weeks with the Tarlov scale, the inclined plane, and a sensory-motor battery of tests (combined behavioral score). After sacrifice at 4 weeks, morphometric analysis of residual gray and white matter was performed at the epicenter of the spinal cord injury. Statistical analysis of the behavioral data failed to reveal any differences among the control or nicardipine treatment groups. The morphometric analysis similarly failed to show differences between the control and any treatment group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Traumatic sacral fractures are most often due to motor vehicle or industrial accidents and are commonly associated with pelvic, urogenital, and neurological injuries. In recent years, a more subtle type of sacral fracture, not associated with major trauma, has been described. It is an osteoporotic insufficiency fracture that presents as low back pain in elderly patients, especially postmenopausal Caucasian women. It may escape detection unless radionuclide bone scans, tomograms, or computed tomograms are obtained. The radiographic features have been detailed in various publications, but little has been reported about the clinical features, treatment, or ultimate outcome of patients with osteoporotic sacral fractures. We have reviewed the charts and radiological studies of 13 women and 3 men who sustained this type of fracture between 1983 and 1986. All of these patients were Caucasian. The average age was 71 years. The most common presenting symptom complex was diffuse low back pain accompanied by hip, buttock, or thigh pain. Pertinent physical findings were limited to tenderness on palpation of the sacrum and a decreased range of low back motion. The osteoporotic fractures were seldom noted on plain roentgenograms of the sacrum, but were readily defined by sacral tomography or computed tomography. Radionuclide bone scanning also proved helpful in making the diagnosis by localizing the process. Treatment was medical and consisted of therapies designed to reduce pain and to combat the associated osteopenia. Of our 16 patients, 11 had complete pain relief, 2 had substantial pain relief, 2 noted decreasing pain before they died of other causes, and 1 was followed less than 1 month.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The cerebellar tonsil was clearly demonstrated in relation to the surrounding structures on T1-weighted images in the paramedian or midline sagittal plane. In 78% of a control group of 50 cases, the tonsil was located just on or close to the upper border of the posterior lip of the foramen magnum. It was close to the line of the foramen magnum in 4 cases (8%), but displacement below this line was not observed in any case. In 18 cases of posterior fossa mass lesions, the tonsil tended to be in a lower position than in the control group, and tonsillar displacement below the foramen magnum was noted in 3 cases. Two of these cases had anterior medullary displacement with loss of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space anterior to the tonsil; these patients had either rapid clinical deterioration or severe papilledema. In the remaining case and in 3 additional cases of Chiari malformation, the tonsils were displaced into the cervical canal with preservation of the CSF space, and the patients showed no signs of rapid clinical deterioration or increased intracranial pressure. The present study suggests that tonsillar displacement through the foramen magnum with associated anterior medullary displacement and loss of the CSF space anterior to the tonsil can be regarded as a sign of tonsillar herniation.\r"

Obstructive hydrocephalus was induced in newborn rats by injection of a suspension of kaolin into the 4th ventricle and cisterna magna. Eleven days later, experimental animals and their sham-operated littermate controls were killed and pieces of frontoparietal cortex, neostriatum, cerebellar vermis, and brain stem were processed for high performance liquid chromatography. Grossly, the lateral ventricles were extremely enlarged, the cerebral cortex was thinned, the neostriatum was compressed, and portions of the tectum and cerebellum were vacuolated. Decreases in norepinephrine (71%), dopamine (73%), and serotonin (50%) were observed in the cerebral cortex, neostriatum, and cerebellum, respectively. Brain stem norepinephrine and serotonin were increased 70% and 50%, respectively. These increases may indicate impairment of axonal transport or damage to projections from the locus ceruleus and raphe region. These preliminary results suggest that infantile hydrocephalus causes perturbations in the levels of different monoamines in several brain regions. Such changes may critically influence neuronal function and development, as well as the therapeutic management of hydrocephalus.\r"

The best therapeutic approach to ventriculitis and meningitis occurring in the presence of this device is still a subject of debate. We reviewed our experience in 66 consecutive patients receiving intraventricular therapy via the Ommaya reservoir for leptomeningeal metastases or for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Eight episodes of infection occurred during the period of treatment, and all of them responded to systemic antibiotics with or without intraventricular treatment. Removal of the Ommaya reservoir was avoided, and therapy via the device for the underlying disease was resumed as soon as the infection was controlled. No relapse of infection occurred during a minimal follow-up of 40 days. On the basis of our experience and review of the literature, we challenge the concept that the Ommaya device, as a foreign body, must be removed to treat such infections successfully.\r"

Ten patients with slow-flow shunts and minimal dysfunction were treated medically to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and/or instructed in manual compression of the internal carotid artery, ipsilateral to the lesion, using the contralateral hand. Percutaneous intraarterial embolization using detachable balloons, isobutylcyanoacrylate, or polyvinyl alcohol particles was successful in 16/18 DAVSs and 9/10 CCFs. The neuro-ophthalmic signs resolved in these 25 cases. Complications occurred in five patients. These included a transient hemiparesis, twelfth nerve palsy, unilateral nasal field loss, a pseudoaneurysm causing a third-nerve paresis, and temporary cavernous sinus thrombosis. Conservative therapy in mild cases and embolization in cases with visual disability or progressive signs are warranted.\r"

Measurements were made at distance (with Vistech charts), at near (with Arden gratings), and with a pinhole to control pupil size. Under all conditions, when visual acuity was reduced by spherical lenses, there was a loss of contrast sensitivity over a broad range of spatial frequencies (i.e., not just at the higher frequencies that correlate with target letter size). By inference, it may be clinically hazardous to interpret contrast sensitivity results in patients with reduced acuity (from any cause) relative only to standard contrast sensitivity values based on subjects with normal visual acuity. If the potential effects of acuity are taken into account, contrast sensitivity testing can distinguish between deficits that are roughly equivalent to the loss of acuity and those which indicate more distinctive pathology of the media, retina, or optic nerve.\r"

  ".W": "A 29-year-old woman had unilateral essential iris atrophy, corneal endothelial changes, and absolute glaucoma. The enucleated eye was examined by routine light microscopy. Separate portions of unfixed fresh frozen cornea were sectioned and reacted with monoclonal antibodies against keratins, vimentin, and inflammatory cell markers. Stains for filamentous actin (f-actin) were performed using the 7-nitro-benz-2-oxa-1,3-diazolylphallacidin (NBD phallacidin) probe. In addition, portions of cornea and iris were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Immunocytochemical stains with anti-keratin antibodies showed reactivity only in the corneal epithelium of the patient and normal control. Immunoreactivity with anti-vimentin antibodies was observed in corneal endothelium and keratocytes of the patient and control, but was negative in the epithelium. Staining for f-actin appeared more pronounced in the corneal endothelium of the patient. Scanning electron microscopy of the corneal endothelium showed irregularity in cell size and shape and filopodial processes characteristic of migrating cells. Transmission electron microscopy disclosed abnormalities of Descemet's membrane and endothelium with a posterior collagenous layer. The corneal endothelium displayed normal junctional complexes without desmosomal junctions or increased microvillus projections. Increased 10-nm cytoplasmic filaments were noted consistent with the expression of vimentin. Occasional chronic inflammatory cells perturbed the corneal endothelium and were detected within the endothelial layer. Alterations in the endothelium and Descemet's membrane suggest the acquired nature of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing experience with the diagnosis of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tears has led to expanded recognition and understanding of this clinical entity. The authors report 18 RPE tears followed for an average of 28 months; 16 were associated with age-related macular degeneration and 2 with presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. Retinal pigment epithelial dehiscences fell into four categories: nine spontaneous tears associated with choroidal neovascularization, one tear associated with an RPE detachment without choroidal neovascularization, four iatrogenic tears occurring at krypton treatment of choroidal neovascularization, and four iatrogenic tears developing weeks to months after laser treatment of choroidal neovascularization. Eight patients had a final visual acuity of 20/100 or better, four were 20/200, and six were 20/400 or worse. Photocoagulation, particularly with the use of krypton red laser, may be modified on the basis of possible RPE tear formation. Heightened awareness of the possibility of inducing pigment epithelial rips should improve diagnosis and management of these cases.\r"

Rotavirus was detected in 51 of 315 infants, 24 at the initial sampling and 27 after 72 hours of hospitalization (nosocomial cases). Forty-one of the cases were symptomatic and 10 were asymptomatic. Nosocomial rotavirus was detected in 5, 13 and 24% of children in the hospital for 4 to 8, 9 to 13 and greater than 13 days, respectively. Attending physicians clinically entertained the diagnosis of rotavirus infection in 58% of community-acquired cases but in only 22% of nosocomial cases. Subgrouping of 24 of the rotavirus isolates with monoclonal antibodies indicated that two-thirds of the isolates were Subgroup II, and the remainder were a mixed subgroup, with similar prevalences in the nosocomial and community-acquired cases. Only 11 of 27 instances of nosocomial rotavirus acquisition were epidemiologically associated with a rotazyme-positive roommate and in 4 of these instances different subgroups were present in the 2 roommates. These data suggest that infected roommates appear not to be a major source for direct transmission of nosocomial rotavirus infection.\r"

We describe an outbreak of giardiasis associated with a hotel's new water slide pool which was cleansed by both bromination and sand filtration. Among the 107 hotel guests and their visitors surveyed, 29 probable and 30 laboratory-confirmed cases of Giardia infection were found. Cases ranged from 3 to 58 years of age, with a mean age of 21 years. The 5-year modal age grouping was 5 to 10 years of age. Symptoms in the 59 cases included: diarrhea (48), cramps (38), foul smelling stools (29), loss of appetite (23), fatigue (20), vomiting (18), greasy stools (15), fever (11) and weight loss (10). Four children and 2 adults were hospitalized. Significant associations were found for staying at the hotel, using the water slide pool and swallowing pool water. A possible contributing factor was the emptying of an adjacent toddlers' wading pool, a potential source of fecal material, into the water slide pool. Transmission of Giardia can occur in water slide pools and therefore should be considered in cases of protracted diarrhea among users of such pools.\r"

Infusions of gamma-globulin (GG) have been shown recently to reduce the prevalence of coronary artery aneurysms in KS patients. One of the proposed mechanisms of action of GG therapy is through an effect on CICs. We analyzed paired sera for CICs from 29 patients with KS, 19 of whom were treated with aspirin and GG and 10 of whom received aspirin only. Assay systems used for CIC detection were Raji-mu enzyme immunoassay, C1q solid phase assay-enzyme immunoassay and F(ab')2-anti-C3-mu enzyme immunoassay. Overall 20 of 29 patients had CICs detected by at least two of three assays used. Of the 19 GG-treated patients 14 had CICs detected: 5 in both paired sera; 2 in pretherapy sera; and 7 posttherapy specimens. There was no correlation between duration of fever, presence of myocarditis or the development of coronary artery aneurysms and the presence of CICs in the serum of KS patients. Although CICs can be found frequently in the sera of KS patients there seems to be no association between the presence of CICs and the duration of fever or the development of coronary artery aneurysms.\r"

Of 630 responses (84.0%), 244 had children in the home; 229 (93.9%) identified a regular and current physician for their youngest child. However, parents did not spend much time or energy selecting a physician and rarely explored medical expertise in their decisions. Families averaged 1.2 sources of information consulted per decision; few considered more than two physician choices and infrequently considered alternative types of doctors (pediatricians v family or general practitioners). Selection priorities ranked in order of importance concerned parents' perceptions of their doctors' communication skills, accessibility, and quality as determined by recommendations of friends or physicians. Parents appeared less concerned with issues of cost and convenience. Families selecting pediatricians differed from those selecting family and general practitioners in sources of information used and selection priorities. The survey also identified 84 families who had changed or seriously considered changing the physician who was caring for their youngest child. The most frequent dissatisfaction was the perception that an illness was not being managed adequately, followed by believing that the doctor or staff were rude or unconcerned. Families unhappy with pediatricians expressed different reasons from those unhappy with family or general practitioners. The study results provide insight about the first step in obtaining child health care services, a relatively unexplored area of patient decision making.\r"

The children's performance was compared with (1) their own performance in a previous study 6 to 8 years after the illness; (2) the performance of 23 similarly aged siblings in the previous study, a comparison which served to age match subjects and sibling controls; and (3) the performance of 11 of those similarly aged siblings retested in the current study. Subjects scored in the average range on all measures. Scores were comparable to results 4 years previous in four of six academic measures, with minor deterioration in reading single words and decoding nonsense words. There were no differences between subjects in the current study and control subjects from the previous study, except in decoding nonsense words, and no differences between subjects and control subjects in the current study, except in paragraph reading accuracy. Scholastic grade point averages and scores on parent and teacher behavior problem-rating scales showed no group differences. Subjects used more school-based remedial services, although the trend did not achieve statistical significance. Parents reported spending more time with subjects than with control subjects helping with homework. These findings suggest that children who have recovered from meningitis due to H influenzae can maintain scores and grades comparable to their siblings as they progress to middle school. Their academic success may involve more school and family support to compensate for the mild differences in intelligence quotient and neuropsychologic testing found in the previous study.\r"

Most students did not recognize the existence of a carrier state. Responses from students of different grades, ages, sexes, races, and school districts differed rarely and without apparent pattern. Students reported that they had learned about AIDS mostly from television or radio (57%) or magazines or newspapers (16%); few had learned from persons with whom they had frequent contact, such as parents (6%) or teachers (4%). Seventy-four percent of students said they wanted to learn more about AIDS, and 49% said they wanted to learn it in school. Results of this study indicated that students' knowledge about AIDS is not adequate, students wish to learn more, and information about AIDS should be presented in public schools.\r"

Breast-feeding rates were 84% among white and 49% among black women. Maternal educational level was strongly associated with breast-feeding, whereas the effect of ethnicity was moderate. Women with some college or some graduate school education had adjusted odds of breast-feeding that were 2.6 (95% confidence limit 1.9 to 3.7) and 5.2 (95% confidence limit 2.7 to 10.2) times higher than women with a high school education or less. In contrast, the adjusted odds of breast-feeding were 2.0 (95% confidence limit 1.4 to 3.1) times higher for white women compared with black women. The odds of breast-feeding increased among black women if they attended childbirth classes, were married, or were older. Among black women, the frequency of breast-feeding decreased sharply by 1 month postpartum. Breast-feeding duration for black v white women was 74% v 90% at 1 month, 44% v 72% at 4 months, and 26% v 50% at 7 months postpartum. The majority of black women (53%) used formula supplements in the hospital, which was the only factor significantly related to a shortened duration in this group (P less than .01). The high rate of formula supplementation among black women and its strong association with shortened duration of breast-feeding point to a need for more advice and support and less reliance on formula during the hospital stay.\r"

Thirteen infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 6 months of corrected age and 12 full-term healthy control infants matched for age or size were studied. Resting oxygen consumption was measured during natural sleep, and an estimation of the resting metabolic expenditure by indirect calorimetry was performed. Growth parameters were measured, and a nutritional profile including dietary intake, stool analysis, and serum albumin, cholesterol, glucose, and prealbumin was obtained. Seven of the 13 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had growth failure (defined as length and weight less than the tenth percentile of the Babson growth curves). These infants had lower birth weight, lower gestational age, and a greater number of days spent in supplemental oxygen or on mechanical ventilation. There was no statistical difference between the bronchopulmonary dysplasia-growth failure and bronchopulmonary dysplasia-normal growth infants for dietary intake or stool or serum analyses. However, serum prealbumin showed a significant linear correlation with body weight in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Resting metabolic expenditure was elevated in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia with growth failure and was inversely correlated with body weight in all infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Thus, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and growth failure have increased metabolic demands and decreased prealbumin values suggesting a relative state of protein-calorie malnutrition.\r"

We monitored esophageal pressure, gastric pressure, and arterial BP. Consistent findings were: (1) arterial BP fluctuations have the same frequency and direction of change as esophageal and gastric pressure changes associated with spontaneous breathing (R ranged from .93 to .98, P less than .001); (2) spontaneous apneic pauses were accompanied by sudden and complete cessation of arterial BP fluctuations; (3) large \"cough-like\" fluctuations in esophageal and gastric pressures, seen in all infants, were associated with the largest fluctuations in arterial BP; (4) cutaneous stimulation had negligible effect on fluctuation in arterial BP provided no change in esophageal and gastric pressures occurred; (5) the effects of change in esophageal and gastric pressures on arterial BP were nearly simultaneous (0.05 to 0.25 second latency); (6) respirator pressure fluctuations had negligible effects on the fluctuations in arterial BP. These data suggest that the fluctuations in arterial BP are directly related to respiratory muscle activity and are most consistent with the familiar pulsus paradoxus that occurs in various other cardiorespiratory diseases.\r"

Considerable centralization was achieved by antenatal and neonatal transport. Although the uncorrected mortality rates were similar, the mortality odds (adjusted for four and 22 potential confounding perinatal factors, respectively) were significantly higher in level 1 and level 2 hospitals compared with level 3 hospitals (tertiary perinatal care centers). By extending the facilities for full perinatal intensive care in level 3 centers and thus providing optimal care for all such infants, the overall mortality rate is expected to decrease further.\r"

Behavioral responsiveness was assessed during the presentation of 15 visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli at 3 months of age (corrected age for preterm infants). Summary scores for positive and negative responsiveness, as well as sociability, soothability, and overall activity levels, were derived from behavioral observations by coders who were unaware of the infant's characteristics. The Bates Infant Characteristic Questionnaire was completed by the main care giver and scored on four summary variables: fussy-difficult, unadaptable, dull, and unpredictable. Preterm infants, regardless of the presence or severity of intraventricular hemorrhage, showed less positive responses and less overall activity in response to stimulation. Infants with grade I to II intraventricular hemorrhage were less sociable and more difficult to soothe than full-term control infants. Individual differences in positive, negative, sociability, and soothability were related to the questionnaire scores of fussy-difficult and unadaptability. Both prematurity and degree of intraventricular hemorrhage affect behavioral responsiveness and these individual differences are related to parental reports of the infant's temperament.\r"

Twelve infants with respiratory failure were evaluated for sequential changes in pulmonary mechanics during continuous pancuronium administration (0.1 mg/kg every two to three hours) for more than 48 hours. The study weight of the neonates ranged from 980 to 2,950 g, and the postconceptional age ranged from 27 to 41 weeks. Pulmonary compliance, resistance, and resistive work of breathing were determined, using least mean square analysis technique, daily for three days and after discontinuation of pancuronium (even though there was no clinical improvement in ventilatory management). The dynamic pulmonary compliance decreased from 0.38 +/- 0.05 to 0.30 +/- 0.04 mL/cm H2O/kg (mean +/- SE) (P less than .05) and the total pulmonary resistance increased 51% from 115.6 +/- 21.3 to 174.9 +/- 27.3 cm H2O/L/s (P less than .005) during prolonged skeletal muscle paralysis. Upon discontinuation of pancuronium, the dynamic pulmonary compliance increased 43% to 0.43 +/- 0.4 mL/cm H2O/kg (P less than .05) and the total pulmonary resistance decreased by 41% (P less than .005). These data question the advisability of prolonged skeletal muscle paralysis in neonates and suggest the need for further detailed evaluation of the effects of prolonged paralysis on neonatal pulmonary mechanics.\r"

The factor II coagulant antigen and normotest levels in one-day-old babies were lower than those of full-term infants (P less than .005, P less than .01, respectively). Infants whose normotest levels were less than 30% at one day (group A) received vitamin K2, and the others whose normotest levels were greater than 30% at one day (group B) were not treated. At this time, the mean factor II coagulant antigen level was significantly lower in group A than in group B (P less than .05). During the first seven days of life, in 65.2% of the infants in group B the PIVKA-II level became positive, but this did not occur in any infant in group A. After vitamin K treatment, there was greater improvement in the normotest level in infants with positive PIVKA-II levels than in those with negative PIVKA-II levels. This observation indicates that the hypoprothrombinemia found in low birth weight infants at one day of age is attributable to reduced synthesis of factor II coagulant antigen in the liver at this stage, but the prophylactic administration of vitamin K seemed to be effective even in such infants, probably because of the increase in factor II coagulant antigen synthesis (P less than .001) during the first seven days of life.\r"

Although the most frequent cardiac lesion is coarctation of the aorta, a spectrum of cardiac defects occurs which is limited almost exclusively to defects associated with decreased blood flow through the left heart. We report the results of gross anatomic and microscopic dissection of 12 fetuses aborted between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation, with the classic Turner phenotype of nuchal cystic hygromas, hydrops fetalis, and female genitalia. Eight fetuses showed a consistent constellation of cardiac defects: diminution of the ascending aorta, large pulmonary artery ranging from 1 1/2 to three times the size of the aorta, large patent ductus arteriosus, and juxtaductal coarctation. Another fetus had hypoplastic left heart and aortic atresia. The remaining three fetuses had normal cardiac anatomy. The lymphatic vessels at the base of the great vessels were carefully examined in nine of the fetuses. Although there was no definite correlation between the degree of cardiac pathology and the extent of lymphatic aberrations at the base of the heart at the time of postmortem examination, the high incidence (75%) of left-sided flow defects among these fetuses, all of whom had large hygromas and severe edema, supports the hypothesis that there is a pathogenetic relationship between lymphatic obstruction and congenital heart disease in the 45,X Turner fetus.\r"

We report an 8-year-old girl with asthma in whom obesity, hirsutism, and growth retardation developed during treatment with inhaled triamcinolone acetonide alone. Laboratory studies showed suppression of endogenous cortisol production but did not demonstrate suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Cessation of inhaled triamcinolone acetonide therapy resulted in resolution of obesity and hirsutism, resumption of normal growth, and a return to normal of serum cortisol levels and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion. Careful monitoring of growth velocity and (if clinically indicated) morning serum cortisol levels in asthmatic children using inhaled corticosteroids will detect the rare instance of glucocorticoid excess resulting from systemic absorption of these drugs.\r"

This is double the relative risk associated with not breast-feeding for infants born into households with toilets, whether or not they had piped water. Analogously, improvements in toilet sanitation appear to have reduced mortality twice as much among infants who did not breast-feed as among those who did. These findings, from a retrospective survey of infants born to a probability sample of 1,262 women in peninsular Malaysia, confirm the pernicious synergistic effect of poor sanitation and nonbreastfeeding that was postulated previously on theoretical grounds. Promoting and maintaining high initiation of breast-feeding is thus particularly important where poor sanitation is prevalent. Even more affluent areas should not be neglected, however, because socioeconomic improvement, including improved environmental sanitation, is often accompanied by decreased breast-feeding. Although the risk to each nonbreast-fed infant was less in those areas, infants there were less likely to breast-feed in Malaysia, and hence they made up a significant proportion of lives that could be saved by breast-feeding.\r"

Use of radionuclear imaging techniques during exercise stress testing appears to be helpful in identifying patients at high risk, who should then be offered coronary arteriography. An ideal treatment has not been established, but a treatment strategy based on symptom relief alone is suboptimal. Measures used for symptomatic ischemia are just as effective with silent ischemia. Treatment must be individualized, and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring appears useful in adjusting antiischemic therapy for a given patient.\r"

The most common symptoms are persistent cough and hemoptysis, sometimes followed by findings of obstructive pneumonia (fever, chills, and purulent sputum). Physical findings are nonspecific, and radiologic findings are varied. Complications include formation of a fistula between the respiratory tract and the esophagus or aorta and obstructive pulmonary symptoms. Treatment ranges from conservative management (simple observation) to thoracotomy for patients in whom complications from stone erosion develop. The prognosis of patients with broncholithiasis is generally excellent.\r"

While the association of C pylori gastritis with peptic ulcer disease is well documented, no causal relationship has been established. Acute inflammatory conditions of the stomach secondary to other disease processes, macroscopic abnormalities of the gastric mucosa, and sometimes poorly characterized epigastric pain all carry the name \"gastritis.\" The fact that, as a disease, gastritis remains an enigma largely stems from the multiple implications of the term. An accurate classification system of the gastritides would be helpful but is not yet available. Until it is, the term \"gastritis\" will have more meaning if accompanied by a description of the type of gastritis or of the responsible etiologic factor, secondary disease, or toxic insult (eg, gastric mucosal injury associated with use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs). Deletion of the term \"gastritis\" from the clinical vocabulary and substitution of better terms (eg, \"nonulcer dyspepsia,\" \"irritable bowel syndrome\") will also serve to clarify the issue.\r"

This interruption is part of the transcribed messenger RNA and appears not to be removed before translation. Thus, the usual colinearity between messenger RNA and the encoded protein sequence apparently does not exist in this case. The interruption is bracketed by a direct repeat of five base pairs. A mechanism is proposed in which folding of the untranslated region brings together codons separated by the interruption so that the elongating ribosome may skip the 50 nucleotides during translation. The alternative possibility, that the protein is efficiently translated from a very minor and undetectable form of processed messenger RNA, seems unlikely, but has not been completely ruled out.\r"

The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) can be detected in the medium of many of these retinal cultures, after release presumably from the choline acetyltransferase-positive amacrine cells. The postsynaptic effect of endogenous or applied ACh on the ganglion cells can be blocked with specific nicotinic antagonists. Here it is shown that within 24 hours of producing such a pharmacologic blockade, the retinal ganglion cells begin to sprout or regenerate neuronal processes. Thus, the growth-enhancing effect of nicotinic antagonists may be due to the removal of inhibition to growth by tonic levels of ACh present in the culture medium. Since there is a spontaneous leak of ACh in the intact retina, the effects of nicotinic cholinergic drugs on process outgrowth in culture may reflect a normal control mechanism for growth or regeneration of retinal ganglion cell processes that is exerted by ACh in vivo.\r"

Ten of the patients had an associated malignant disease including carcinoma of the colon and rectum in six, hematologic malignant conditions in three and carcinoma of the gallbladder in one. Of the remaining six patients, four had evidence of immune suppression (two had leukopenia, one was preleukemic and one had undergone a postcadaver renal transplant), one had diabetes and one had overwhelming sepsis due to a perforated gallbladder with peritonitis. Only three of the 19 patients were otherwise healthy, and infection occurred after trauma in all of these patients. Four patients were moribund upon admission and died before initial therapy was completed. In the other 15 patients, treatment consisted of administration of penicillins and broad spectrum antibiotics and debridement, as well as hyperbaric oxygen in 13 patients. Thirteen of 19 patients died and eight of ten with malignant disease died. The data show a striking relationship between Clostridium septicum and both malignant disease and immune suppression.\r"

  ".W": "Neurotensin is a potent inhibitor of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. This study was done to investigate the possible role of vagal innervation and of prostaglandins on this inhibitory effect. Five dogs with gastric cannulas were infused with pentagastrin (1 microgram per kilogram of body weight each hour) for 210 minutes. In the 60 to 150 minute period, neurotensin (5.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight each hour) was infused. Neurotensin significantly decreased pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid output, while the simultaneous administration of indomethacin (bolus of 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight plus infusion of 0.5 milligrams per kilogram each hour) abolished the effect of neurotensin. After truncal vagotomy, the inhibitory effect of neurotensin was again studied. Since the sensitivity of the stomach to pentagastrin decreased after vagotomy, the dose of pentagastrin was doubled (2 micrograms per kilogram of body weight each hour) in order to achieve acid stimulation comparable with the levels before vagotomy. After vagotomy, neurotensin inhibited the effect of pentagastrin in a manner similar to that shown before vagotomy. The inhibitory potency of neurotensin on gastrin-stimulated gastric secretion is independent of the vagus, but requires intact synthesis for prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "Four solutions of bovine polymerized hemoglobin (BPHS) and rabbit plasma were used to replace one-third of the blood volume in five groups of rabbits. The first three solutions were \"impure\" because of the presence of stromal phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and phosphatidyl-serine in BPHS-1, environmental endotoxins in BPHS-2, and a large amount of higher molecular weight hemoglobin-glutaraldehyde polymers in BPHS-3. These solutions caused a 33 per cent mortality rate and significant morbidity which was characterized by hemodynamic instability, respiratory and renal insufficiency, elevation of hepatic enzyme levels, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and activation of the alternate pathway of complement. Histopathologic changes found in the heart, lungs, liver, spleen and kidney were characterized by a combination of ischemic and inflammatory lesions. Fibrin thrombi were visible by immunofluorescence in the microcirculation. In contrast, the fourth solution (BPHS-4) was free of the aforementioned impurities; caused no deaths and minimal morbidity, which was limited to elevated levels of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and reduction of creatinine clearance; no DIC or complement activation, and mild histopathologic changes which were exclusively ischemic in nature. The results of this study indicated that the toxicity of polymerized hemoglobin solutions is due principally to the presence of impurities. Pure hemoglobin does exhibit mild toxicity when compared with a control solution which is most likely due to a vasoconstrictor effect of oxyhemoglobin.\r"

During a 12 year period, 90 octogenarians underwent CE. Ages ranged from 80 to 93 years with a mean of 83 years. Two groups of patients younger than 80 years of age were selected from the series for comparison. There were no differences between age groups with respect to operative mortality and morbidity, with two deaths and one stroke in the elderly group. Follow-up periods ranged from one to 120 months with a mean of 39 months. There were two late strokes in patients older than 80 years of age. At late follow-up study, 87 per cent of patients operated upon for hemispheric symptoms were free of neurologic deficits; in contrast, only 67 per cent of those operated upon for nonhemispheric symptoms were symptom-free (p less than 0.05). The incidence of occlusive disease of the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery was higher in the elderly group (p less than 0.01). The presence of intracranial occlusive disease represented an unfavorable factor in regard to the results of CE in patients with nonhemispheric symptoms. The over-all five year survival rate was 60 per cent. These data indicate that advanced age alone should not be considered a contraindication to CE. Excellent results should be expected in instances of operations performed for hemispheric symptoms. In instances of nonhemispheric symptoms, results are less encouraging because of the high incidence of intracranial carotid occlusive disease.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight adult patients with isolated splenic trauma from blunt injury were analyzed during a six year period (1980 to 1986). Early laparotomy was performed upon 38 patients and splenic preservation was accomplished in 18. The remaining ten patients who were hemodynamically stable were managed nonoperatively with close monitoring. Splenic injuries were confirmed by one of the imaging methods, such as computed tomography, radionuclide scan or ultrasound. One patient with known hepatic cirrhosis underwent embolization of the splenic artery and recovered. Nonoperative treatment failed in seven of the remaining nine patients, mandating an exploratory laparotomy between the third and tenth day of admission. In six of the seven patients, splenic preservation was unsuccessful, necessitating a splenectomy. The length of hospital stay was longer for this latter group (a mean of 15.8 days) than for patients who had splenorrhaphy (a mean of 7.5 days), or splenectomy (a mean of 8.7 days, p less than 0.001). Patients managed nonoperatively required more units of blood compared with those undergoing splenorrhaphy (4.1 units versus 1.7 units, p less than 0.01). A review of the literature reveals that splenic preservation is possible in less than 25 per cent of the patients who fail to respond to nonoperative management. We conclude that splenic injuries after blunt trauma in adults are treated best by early laparotomy in order to achieve maximal splenic preservation.\r"

Sixty-four Mongolian gerbils were anesthetized with pentobarbital and the left internal carotid artery was ligated in both control and experimental animals. In the experimental group, blood was removed and an equal volume of dextran was injected to reestablish normal blood volume and lower hematocrit to a mean of 30.5. Control animals were not so treated. Animals were observed for neurological deficits for 24 hours after carotid ligation. The incidence of neurological deficit in control animals was 67%; it was 64% in the experimental group. Mortality within the first 24 hours was 28% in the controls and 75% in animals that were treated by hemodilution (p less than 0.001). Isovolemic hemodilution with dextran did not reduce the incidence of neurological deficit after carotid ligation in gerbils and was associated with a significant increase in mortality during the first 24 hours.\r"

Hypothyroidism may also produce pituitary enlargement secondary to thyrotroph hyperplasia and present with a sellar mass and hyperprolactinemia. Three hypothyroid patients who presented with presumed prolactin-producing adenomas are reported. Although laboratory and radiologic abnormalities of pituitary enlargement may resolve after corrective thyroid therapy, our patients showed no such response and underwent operation. Histologic examination revealed no adenomas, but thyrotroph and lactotroph hyperplasia were present. Thyrotroph hyperplasia probably results from lack of negative feedback of thyroid hormone upon the anterior pituitary. Whether this is due to hypothalamic release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or another mechanism is unclear. Lactotroph hyperplasia may result from excess TRH, which stimulates lactotrophs with resultant hyperprolactinemia, or from reduced hypothalamic dopamine, thereby facilitating prolactin secretion. This study suggest that (a) hyperprolactinemia in hypothyroidism is not necessarily due to the \"stalk section effect\" secondary to pituitary enlargement, and (b) patients with primary hypothyroidism and sellar mass should initially be managed medically so that potentially reversible pituitary hyperplasia is not mistaken for adenoma.\r"

There were 48 (55%) male and 40 (45%) female patients. Ages ranged from 33 to 97 years (mean, 73 years). Local anesthesia was used in 84 (84%) cases. Fifteen (17%) patients died within 30 days of the procedure. Major limb amputation was required within 30 days of operation in 16 (16%) patients. Mortality rate in the group of patients needing early amputation was 50% compared with 11% for those who underwent successful embolectomy procedures (p less than 0.001). Current follow-up was established for all patients. Five-year and 10-year survival rates for the entire group were 40% and 35%, respectively. The most frequent causes of late death after femoral artery embolectomy were arteriosclerotic heart disease (26%), cerebrovascular accident (26%), and advanced carcinoma (21%). All 39 remaining survivors were located 8 to 126 months (mean, 48 months) after discharge to complete a questionnaire designed to assess quality of life and symptoms of vascular insufficiency. Thirty-five (90%) survivors were fully ambulatory and 27 (70%) lived in their own homes. Although early survival is decreased after femoral embolectomy, long-term survivors can be expected to live independently with excellent limb salvage and function.\r"

In ten obese patients who had limb-threatening ischemia or rapidly worsening disabling claudication and aortoiliac occlusive disease, direct aortoiliac reconstruction was performed. There were no perioperative deaths, and only one major complication occurred in this group. The cumulative 5-year graft limb-patency and limb-salvage rates were each 90%.

Epidural analgesia for pin prick extended from the fourth thoracic to the first lumbar nerve for 48 hours. Assessments of pain, various injury response parameters, peak flow, and subjective feeling of fatigue were performed preoperatively, 3 and 6 hours after skin incision, and 1, 2, 4, and 8 days postoperatively. The epidural analgesia-systemic indomethacin treatment eliminated postoperative pain during rest and coughing. In contrast, only a minor and clinically unimportant modulation of the conventional perioperative and postoperative changes in plasma cortisol, glucose, transferrin, orosomucoid, leukocyte and differential counts, rectal temperature, peak flow, and fatigue was observed.

We hypothesized that occlusion of the pancreatic duct and its smaller ductules with prolamine (Ethibloc) in opossums at risk of severe necrotizing pancreatitis would have a beneficial effect on the progression of the disease. Sixteen opossums underwent bile duct ligation below the entrance of the pancreatic duct. They were divided into four groups at 6 days. Group I (control, n = 5) opossums were killed for histologic observation of the degree of necrosis of the pancreas; group II (n = 5) underwent external drainage of the pancreatic biliary duct; group III (n = 4) had external biliary drainage and ligation of the pancreatic duct; group IV (n = 7) was treated with external biliary drainage and ligation of the main pancreatic duct after instillation of prolamine. Serum amylase, lipase, and calcium values were determined. The pancreas was examined by inspection and histologically at the time of death, and the severity of the disease was determined by quantitation of pancreatic tissue necrosis. All animals in groups II and III died 8 to 14 days after bile duct ligation, and all had severe necrotizing pancreatitis. All animals in group IV survived and were killed at 2 to 10 weeks after prolamine (Ethibloc) injection into the pancreatic duct. A mild edematous pancreatitis was observed in all seven animals. Prolamine (Ethibloc) provided dramatic protection from progressive necrosis. This study does not provide an explanation, but it allows for speculation that ductal injection interrupted the deleterious effect of proteolytic enzymes and their leakage into the interstitial space of the pancreas.\r"

Of a total of 2,908 goiters operated on over a 17-year period, 58 cases with this particular complication were studied retrospectively to define optimal management. Twenty-two patients had severe or acute dyspnea, and four of them required immediate tracheal intubation. Thirty-six patients had chronic dyspnea without cyanosis. Carcinoma was present in these two groups in 50% and 11% of patients, respectively. Results of our retrospective study are as follows: long-standing tolerance of goiter did not preclude the possibility of compressive respiratory distress or carcinoma. Optimal management of goiter with respiratory compression was obtained when surgery was delayed until satisfactory operating room conditions and adequate possibilities of interpretation of pathologic conditions were united. In case of respiratory distress, tracheal intubation allowed to abide without risks. In other patients preoperative investigations were kept to a minimum. Technical artifices facilitated the extraction of the goiter via cervicotomy without sternotomy in 92% of patients with minimal morbidity. Whenever necessary, endotracheal intubation obviated the need for tracheostomy. These data suggest preventive removal of all large or substernal goiters.\r"

Reduced mean CCSE scores correlated directly with CBF reductions in patients with multi-infarct dementia (p less than 0.0005) and dementia of the Alzheimer's type (p less than 0.028). Patients with multi-infarct dementia had CCSE scores with retest variability exceeding those of controls (p less than 0.001) and of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (p less than 0.003). CCSE scores and CBF changed together 78.6% (p less than 0.001) of the time in patients with multi-infarct dementia compared with 66.2% of the time (p less than 0.01) in those with both, 62.9% of the time (p less than 0.05) in those with dementia of the Alzheimer's type, and 47.7% of the time (NS) in controls. Further analyses indicated that changes in CCSE scores and CBF were predominantly progressive declines in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type, whereas the changes were more bidirectional (both increases and decreases) in patients with multi-infarct dementia; these differences were also significant. Results support the diagnostic usefulness of the Hachinski ischemic scale and confirm that both cognition and CBF fluctuate together among patients with multi-infarct dementia, whereas patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type exhibit a more stable course, with progressive declines in cognition and CBF.\r"

Additionally, to ascertain the relation of incidence to the size of the geographic area and/or population, a similar analysis was made on a larger area of Shimane Prefecture, including Izumo City, with a total population of 789,712. During this 5-year period, a total of 83 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were hospitalized in Izumo City, 548 patients in Shimane Prefecture. Ruptured aneurysms were confirmed in 77 cases (93%) in Izumo City and 466 cases (85%) in Shimane Prefecture. The crude annual incidences of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage for Izumo City and Shimane Prefecture were 21.0 and 13.9 per 100,000 population for all ages, and the age-adjusted annual incidences (adjusted to the 1980 population of Japan) were 18.3 and 11.0 per 100,000 for all ages, respectively. For both Izumo City and Shimane Prefecture, the age-specific annual incidences peaked at the ages of 50-69 years, and the highest incidence was 92.3 per 100,000 men from Izumo City in the eighth decade of life. The annual incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage for Izumo City is the highest reported to date. If a wider area, such as Shimane Prefecture, were studied many patients in poor condition, particularly elderly patients, would be missed. To determine accurately the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, it thus might be better to conduct the study in a small city such as Izumo City.\r"

The mortality rates were particularly high among the elderly over the age of 70 years and among unoperated cases. The leading cause of death in these cases was the effect of aneurysm rupture itself, followed by rebleeding and vasospasm. The 5-year survival probabilities according to life table analysis were 50% for Izumo City and 59% for Shimane Prefecture, and a significant difference was observed in survival curves between Izumo City and Shimane Prefecture. It is concluded that the smaller the community studied, the less favorable the overall outcome, mainly because of poorer clinical conditions on admission.\r"

  ".W": "Mortality rates for stroke in 1971, 1974, 1977, and 1980 were obtained for residents of Allegheny County in western Pennsylvania. Hospital case fatality ratios were also obtained in the same 4 years for those discharged with the diagnosis of stroke (ICD 430-438 of the Eighth and Ninth Revisions of the International Classification of Disease) in two large hospitals (greater than 400 beds). Age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 population have declined significantly in this period for the whole county as well as for the four sex-race groups. Case fatality ratio in the two hospitals of the study has decreased from 19.6 to 11%. A change in the severity of the disease manifested by a reduction in the number of comatose patients has occurred, and this reduction in comatose patients was responsible for greater than 80% of the decline in case fatality ratio. Coma appears to be the best predictor of mortality among hospitalized stroke cases (r = 0.6, p less than 0.00001). The recent introduction of computed tomography for the diagnosis of stroke in the late 1970s was accompanied by a twofold increase in the survivorship of stroke patients. However, this increase in survivorship may reflect selection bias and is based on ecological association. Further studies are needed to examine the role of computed tomography in improving survival.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study to correlate admission glucose level with neurologic outcome in stroke, 252 acute stroke patients without prior disability and admitted within 24 hours of onset of ictus were assessed. The stroke was classified into one of three types--cortical infarct, lacunar infarct, or intracerebral hemorrhage--by clinical, computed tomographic, and necropsy findings. Fifty-one diabetic patients were excluded from the entire cohort to form a nondiabetic category for analysis. We found that admission glucose level showed a significantly higher degree of correlation with mortality and morbidity (measured as arm function, leg function, and activities of daily living) when cortical (n = 118) and lacunar (n = 58) infarcts were pooled compared with when they were assessed separately. For intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 76), admission glucose level correlated with mortality but not morbidity. This trend persisted despite exclusion of diabetic patients. These results are consistent with previous observations of a correlation between a high admission glucose level and the severity of stroke. The importance of segregating cortical from lacunar infarcts, two groups with a different natural history and prognosis, in any future analysis is emphasized.\r"

Over a 3-year period we registered 131 cases; the annual incidence of \"first amaurosis fugax episodes coming to medical attention\" was 8.6 and 6.2 per 100,000 population for men and women, respectively. On the basis of a comparison of the age-incidence curves for cerebral and retinal ischemic attacks, the \"true\" incidence of amaurosis fugax is estimated to be approximately 14/100,000/yr, or 25-30% of the reported incidence of transient ischemic attacks. Clinical and/or radiologic signs of a carotid lesion on the appropriate side were present in 56% of the patients, and an additional 27% had symptoms or signs of other organic cardiovascular disorders. Forty-three (68%) of the 63 patients who underwent arteriography had an atheromatous lesion apparently amenable to carotid endarterectomy. In spite of the case-finding procedures employed in the study, cases of amaurosis fugax suitable for carotid surgery were thus ascertained at a rate of only 3/100,000/yr. This suggests that surgical treatment of patients with retinal ischemic attacks is of minor importance as a preventive measure against stroke in the community.\r"

Twenty-three patients had anterior circulation infarcts, and two more had infarcts in the vertebrobasilar territories.

Of the 25 ischemic infarction cases, 23 (92%) had hydrocephalus, 19 (76%) basal exudates, and 2 (8%) tuberculomas. Outcome was poor since no patient with infarction recovered completely. Six died and bilateral subcortical infarcts led to a considerably higher mortality than unilateral ones, whether cortical or subcortical.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy in a general population was evaluated in brains of 400 consecutive autopsies of residents of Hisayama, Japan (November 1971-October 1983). Six samples taken from frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, hippocampus, and basal ganglia of the same side of each brain were stained with both hematoxylin and eosin and Congo red. The specimens were surveyed microscopically with polarized light for deposition of amyloid in the vascular wall. In 26 cases with brain hemorrhage, the region surrounding the hemorrhagic sites was further examined to study the probable causal relation between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and brain hemorrhage. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy was found in 40 of 218 men (18.3%) and 51 of 182 women (28.0%). The incidence increased with age in both sexes. The frontal lobe was most frequently affected (66 cases), followed by parietal lobe (65), occipital lobe (49), temporal lobe (44), and hippocampus (32); the putamen was never affected. The incidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy did not correlate with blood pressure or with the severity of cerebral atherosclerosis. Among the 26 cases in which there was brain hemorrhage, only one cerebellar hemorrhage, in an 85-year-old man, was attributed to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This case showed four microaneurysms in vessels, with cerebral amyloid angiopathy surrounding the hemorrhagic site. Thirty similar lesions were observed in eight cases without brain hemorrhage. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy may play an etiologic role in the development of brain hemorrhage through formation of angionecrosis and microaneurysm.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) on neurologic deficits and cerebral glucose metabolism were studied in a rat model of transient cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding both common carotid arteries for 20 or 30 minutes 24 hours after the vertebral arteries were permanently occluded by electrocautery. CDP-choline was administered intraperitoneally twice daily for 4 days after reestablishing carotid blood flow. CDP-choline at two dosages (50 and 250 mg/kg) shortened the time required for recovery of spontaneous motor activity in a dose-related manner; recovery time was measured early after reperfusion. Neurologic signs were observed for 10 days. High-dose CDP-choline improved neurologic signs in the rats within 20-30 minutes of ischemia. When cerebral glucose metabolism was assessed on Day 4, increases in the levels of glucose and pyruvate were accompanied by decreases in the synthesis of labeled acetylcholine from uniformly labeled [14C]glucose measured in the cerebral cortex of rats with 30 minutes of ischemia. High-dose CDP-choline also attenuated changes in these variables. CDP-[1,2-14C]choline injected intravenously 10 minutes after reperfusion was used for membrane lipid biosynthesis. These results indicate that CDP-choline has beneficial effects on brain dysfunction induced by cerebral ischemia, which may be due in part to the restorative effects of CDP-choline on disturbed cerebral glucose metabolism, probably by stimulating phospholipid biosynthesis.\r"

We administered low-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch to rabbits after embolic infarction and measured specific gravity and total water content. We found evidence of ischemic edema in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the embolic arterial occlusion, but the measures of edema were not different in treated and control groups. Of those rabbits suffering severe neurologic deficit, mortality was 2 of 13 in the treated compared with 7 of 12 in the control groups (p less than 0.01). Thus, hemodilution with low-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch did not exacerbate cerebral edema and may have improved survival in this model.\r"

Ventilated newborn lambs (n = 14) were subjected to a gradual asphyxial insult, resuscitated, and returned to control ventilator settings. During the time 2-5 hours after asphyxia, the responses of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral oxygen delivery (OD), cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2), and cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (E) to changes in either arterial oxygen content (CaO2) or mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were assessed. These data were compared with measurements from nonasphyxiated lambs (n = 7). With hypoxia (n = 7), cerebral blood flow increased (CBF = 646/CaO2 + 44) compared with nonasphyxiated lambs (CBF = 1121/CaO2 + 11). In asphyxiated lambs, cerebral oxygen delivery decreased (OD = 0.41 CaO2 + 6.87), but cerebral oxygen consumption remained stable due to a proportional increase in cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (E = -0.014 CaO2 + 0.65). In nonasphyxiated lambs, cerebral oxygen delivery, consumption, and fractional extraction were unchanged with hypoxia. In response to alterations in blood pressure, both cerebral blood flow (CBF = 0.84 MAP + 6.62) and oxygen delivery (OD = 0.13 MAP + 0.77) were pressure-passive. With hypotension, cerebral fractional oxygen extraction increased (E = -0.003 MAP + 0.69) but not enough to prevent a decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2 = 0.042 MAP + 1.79). In nonasphyxiated lambs, cerebral blood flow, oxygen delivery, consumption, and fractional extraction did not vary with blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Immature rats subjected to a combination of unilateral common carotid artery ligation and hypoxia sustain brain damage confined largely to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. To ascertain the extent and distribution of ischemic alterations in the brains of these small animals, we modified the Sakurada technique to measure regional cerebral blood flow using carbon-14 autoradiography. Seven-day-old rats underwent right common carotid artery ligation following which they were rendered hypoxic with 8% O2 at 37 degrees C. Before and during hypoxia, the rat pups received an injection of iodo[14C]antipyrine for determination of regional cerebral blood flow. Blood flows to individual structures of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere were not influenced by arterial occlusion alone; flows to the contralateral hemisphere and to the brainstem and cerebellum actually increased by 25-50%. Hypoxia-ischemia was associated with decreases in regional cerebral blood flow of the ipsilateral hemisphere such that by 2 hours, flows to subcortical white matter, neocortex, striatum, and thalamus were 15, 17, 34, and 41% of control, respectively. The hierarchy of the blood flow reductions correlated closely with the distribution and extent of ischemic neuronal necrosis. However, unlike the pathologic pattern of this model, the degree of ischemia appeared homogeneous within each brain region. Blood flows to contralateral cerebral hemispheric structures were relatively unchanged from prehypoxic values, whereas flows to the brainstem and cerebellum nearly doubled and tripled, respectively. Thus, ischemia is the predominant factor that determines the topography of tissue injury to major regions of immature rat brain, whereas metabolic factors (intrinsic vulnerability) may influence the heterogeneous pattern of damage seen within individual structures.\r"

This type of patient is not common. A surgical approach that attempts to eliminate the deep dorsal penile system or the crural veins is not as successful. Perhaps subtle arterial disease, concurrent presence of neurologic disease, and collateralization all add to the significant failure rate. Many failures of spontaneous erection will, however, respond to intracavernous injection of vasoactive agents postoperatively. Deep dorsal vein arterialization probably should be reserved for those patients who have an arterial component to their impotence as well as a venogenic cause.\r"

  ".W": "The ErecAid System is based on the simple concept of entrapment of blood in the penis following vacuum-assisted penile engorgement by proximally placed elastic constriction bands. The SYNERGIST Erection System is a semirigid external appliance shaped like a condom that is left on the penis after vacuum tumescence has been achieved. Both devices can be used safely by any man who feels that he has an impotence problem, and the outcome is fairly predictable. These devices seem to be especially effective in men with partial impotence, and they offer the impotent man an alternative to surgical placement of penile prosthesis, a surgical revascularization procedure, intracavernosal injection of vasoactive drugs, or sexual abstinence. These devices appear to be safe and relatively inexpensive ways for the impotent man to make his penis rigid enough to engage in sexual intercourse. An impotent man who selects suction-device therapy may still be able to use other forms of treatment should he need or choose it.\r"

Sixteen sheep were randomized to OKY-046, 3 mg/kg, or saline vehicle before 3-hour occlusion and subsequent reperfusion of the left anterior descending artery. The OKY group demonstrated less ventricular irritability as measured by incidence of ventricular fibrillation and necessity for countershock to reverse tachyarrhythmias. Coronary sinus thromboxane levels were significantly lower in the OKY group compared with the control group. There is additional evidence to suggest that OKY increases infarct salvage and attenuates histologic features of microcirculatory damage.\r"

In addition, the extent of T1 and T2 abnormalities was compared to the extent of infarction as determined histologically for each set of images. With sustained coronary occlusion, an increase versus control values (T1 = 351 +/- 11 msec; T2 = 41 +/- 2 msec) was observed in the second hour after occlusion (T1 = 448 +/- 51 msec; T2 = 51 +/- 8 msec), gradually reaching a maximum by day 5 (T1 = 490 +/- 64 msec; T2 = 63 +/- 9 msec). By 21 days, T1 had decreased to 427 +/- 43 msec and T2 to 55 +/- 11 msec.

Subsequently, T1 remained elevated whereas T2 normalized.

During follow-up, 135 patients were asymptomatic with normal results of exercise tolerance tests, recurrent symptoms developed in 81 patients, and 64 patients underwent repeat angiography. The overall restenosis rate was 21%. In the dissection group, 11 (18%) had documented restenosis and 49 (82%) did not develop restenosis. In the nondissection group, 35 (24%) had documented restenosis and 113 (76%) did not develop restenosis.

However, the fate of well-developed collaterals immediately after a successful PTCA is unknown. Accordingly, 15 patients with Rentrop class 2 or 3 collaterals as visualized angiographically were studied immediately after successful single-vessel PTCA. The left anterior descending artery contained the stenosis in nine patients and the right coronary contained the stenosis in six patients. There was total occlusion of six vessels and subtotal occlusions of nine vessels pre PTCA. Immediately after PTCA, flow through the collaterals to the stenosed artery could no longer be visualized angiographically in eight patients (group 1), but remained faintly visible in seven patients (group 2). There was no difference between these two groups with regard to pre PTCA transstenotic pressure gradient (46 +/- 12 vs 42 +/- 14 mm Hg), post PTCA pressure gradient (13 +/- 7 vs 11 +/- 10 mm Hg), or post PTCA percent luminal diameter narrowing (26 +/- 18% vs 24 +/- 13%). These findings suggest that despite similar hemodynamic and angiographic improvement, the resolution of collaterals immediately after PTCA is variable.\r"

Seventy-one percent were asymptomatic or had infrequent angina; 13% had recurrences but had periods of remission lasting at least 10 months. Only 16% had persistent angina. None of the clinical or angiographic findings at the time of diagnosis were predictive of myocardial infarction or death, and they could not separate angina-free patients from those with recurrences. Thus, vasospastic angina without fixed coronary narrowing has a good prognosis despite the possibility of recurrences. However, there is a slight risk of myocardial infarction and death. This fact should be considered if there are plans to discontinue treatment.\r"

The possible sites of pain radiation were limited to neck/jaw, left arm, right arm, and interscapular. The patient described whether or not the pain was typical of previous angina, and the presence of ST segment deviation was noted to be certain that ischemia was present. The analysis showed that the occluded artery could not be reliably identified. However, it was possible to say which artery was most likely not diseased. Patients presenting with substernal or left chest pain with radiation to the left arm had a less than 10% chance of having right coronary artery disease. A patient presenting with epigastric pain radiating to the neck or jaw had a less than 13% chance of having left anterior descending disease.

We prospectively examined efficacy and safety of an algorithm for VT termination combining rapid ventricular pacing with low and moderate energy transvenous shocks in patients with sustained VT. Sixty-three VT episodes in 23 patients, mean age 64 +/- 12 years, were treated with the algorithm. Bursts of rapid ventricular pacing and transvenous shocks were delivered with a Medtronic 6880 catheter positioned in the right ventricular apex. VT episodes with cycle lengths greater than 270 msec (group A) were treated with sequential therapy with rapid ventricular pacing (90%, 80%, and 70% of VT cycle length), low energy transvenous shocks (0.5 to 2.7 J), and moderate energy (2.7 to 10 J) transvenous shocks. Rapid VT episodes with cycle lengths less than 270 msec (group B) were treated with moderate energy transvenous shocks directly. Forty-one of 48 (85%) VT episodes in group A and 6 of 15 (40%) VT episodes in group B were successfully terminated by this algorithm. There was no difference in clinical or arrhythmia characteristics between responders and nonresponders in either group A or group B to the algorithm. VT acceleration was observed in 12% of episodes in group A and in 47% of episodes in group B. We conclude that an algorithm combining rapid ventricular pacing with low and moderate energy transvenous shocks is effective for VT termination in episodes with a cycle length greater than 270 msec and can reduce the need for transthoracic cardioversion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88147769\r", 
  ".W": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) produces a wide variety of hemodynamic outcomes. Variations in autonomic nervous system response were studied in an animal model of VT. In 18 dogs anesthetized with chloralose VT was simulated by ventricular pacing (rate 240 bpm). Dynamic changes in left ventricular (LV) function were assessed during sinus rhythm and after VT was initiated, under variable autonomic conditions: ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium (n = 5), alpha-adrenergic blockade with terazosin (n = 7; 0.3 mg/kg), and beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (n = 6; 2 mg/kg). Micromanometers were used to measure LV pressure, and endocardial piezo crystals assessed changes in cavity size. Sinus interval, an index of autonomic tone, was determined immediately after tachycardia was terminated. Under control conditions the onset of simulated VT was accompanied by severe hypotension, with a decline in LV systolic pressure from 113 +/- 5 to 67 +/- 4 mm Hg within 10 seconds (p less than 0.05). Subsequently, during persistent tachycardia peak LV pressure recovered to sinus values, and maximum +dP/dt exceeded sinus values by 20 seconds (2604 +/- 413 vs 2112 +/- 184 mm Hg/sec; 20 seconds for VT vs sinus rhythm). Diastolic pressures were unchanged, and sinus rate accelerated. Ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium resulted in persistent hypotension, blunted +dP/dt, no change in diastolic pressures, and failure of the sinus rate to accelerate after the tachycardia. After beta blockade there was sustained hypotension (LV systolic pressure 78 +/- 4 vs 120 +/- 5 mm Hg; 20 seconds for VT vs sinus rhythm), maximum +dP/dt was blunted, and minimum diastolic ventricular pressure rose. This was due to an upward shift in the diastolic pressure-dimension relationship associated with prolongation of the time constant of LV relaxation. The sinus interval did not change. In contrast, tachycardia during alpha blockade produced a sustained fall in peak LV pressure; however, maximum +dP/dt recovered (2194 +/- 328 vs 2154 +/- 153 mm Hg/sec; 20 seconds for VT vs sinus rhythm), minimum diastolic LV pressure remained low, and sinus rate accelerated after ventricular tachycardia. Hemodynamic recovery during ventricular tachycardia is mediated by the response of the autonomic nervous system and requires both alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction and beta-adrenergic augmentation of contraction and relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed changes in the spontaneous cycle length of sustained tachycardia during the first 100 beats after electrophysiologic initiation of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrioventricular nodal tachycardia (AVNT), and circus movement tachycardia incorporating an accessory pathway (CMT). The mean cycle length of VT was 288 +/- 75 msec, for AVNT this value was 388 +/- 63 msec, and for CMT this value was 348 +/- 76 msec. After initiation, in all three types of tachycardia changes in cycle length of up to +/- 15% to 25% were observed. The changes in cycle length ranged from +12% to -18% in patients with VT, from +17% to -15% in patients with AVNT, and from +17% to -15% in patients with CMT. The mean percentage of changes during the first 100 beats of tachycardia was 7.0 +/- 4.7% (VT), 9.5 +/- 5.4% (AVNT) and 8.3 +/- 5.4% (CMT). Patients with VT and AVNT showed both a constant increase or decrease or alteration of the rate of tachycardia. In no patient with CMT was there a constant decrease in cycle length after initiation. The mean time to achieve the maximal increase or decrease in cycle length was 13 +/- 6 and 11 +/- 9 seconds in patients with VT and 16 +/- 3 and 20 +/- 7 seconds in patients with AVNT. In patients with CMT, the mean time to achieve the maximal increase (10 +/- 7 seconds) or decrease (20 +/- 9 seconds) varied markedly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study investigated if signal-averaged low amplitude atrial potentials predict atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF). Low amplitude potentials were considered to be high-frequency, high amplitude P (HiFP) duration recorded between 50 and 250 Hz at 1.0 mm/microV amplitude minus unfiltered P (UnFP) duration at 0.1 mm/microV. In nine normals, HiFP averaged 115.6 msec +/- 9.8 SD. HiFP were wider in 26 control patients (133.5 msec +/- 15.7, p less than 0.005) but HiFP-UnFP (11.2 msec +/- 8.5) and signals less than 10 microV terminating HiFP inscription (21.7 msec +/- 23.4) were similar to normal values. Seventeen patients with paroxysmal or recently cardioverted AFF did not have significantly longer intervals than controls (HiFP averaged 138.8 msec +/- 23.0, HiFP-UnFP 13.2 msec +/- 9.3, and signals less than 10 microV 32.4 msec +/- 19.5). Therefore, signal-averaged P waves do not identify patients with AFF.\r"

The ventricular tachycardias have in some instances been associated with ventricular tumors as the cause of the tachycardia. Once the tumor is removed, the tachycardia stops and the heart function improves. Atrial ectopic tachycardias also produce a similar picture, but have not been associated with atrial tumors. Such a case is presented with an atrial rhabdomyoma producing atrial ectopic tachycardia and a dilated, poorly contracting myocardium. The tumor was resected and the tachycardia was immediately abolished. Cardiac function quickly returned to normal.\r"

We now report the results of a prospective study in 50 children operated on for ASD with selective cannulation of the superior vena cava. ECGs and Holter recordings were made before and after surgery, with a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. We found a significant decrease in postoperative arrhythmias (p less than 0.05) after changing the cannulation technique. Severe arrhythmias, present in 10% of the children in the retrospective group, were not found in the prospective study. Six children had asymptomatic arrhythmias on the Holter recording 1 year after surgery. Three of them, however, already had arrhythmias before the operation. We conclude that the incidence and severity of arrhythmias after ASD repair can be reduced significantly by surgical modifications, at least for the follow-up period of this study. The long-term significance has to be awaited.\r"

  ".W": "Femoral artery thrombosis remains a well-known complication after cardiac catheterization. A study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for this complication. A total of 526 consecutive infants and children were prospectively evaluated after cardiac catheterization, and the medical charts of 42 patients who required femoral artery thrombectomy between 1975 and 1985 were reviewed. In the prospective study, patients were given a bolus injection of heparin, 150 U/kg, at the time the artery was entered. Patients with persistently absent or diminished pulse 2 hours after catheterization received a second bolus injection of 50 U/kg followed by an infusion of 20 U/kg/hr heparin for a maximum of 48 hours. If the affected leg pulse was absent or reduced and the systolic Doppler blood pressure was less than two thirds that of the unaffected leg, thrombolytic therapy was begun. In the 42 patients with surgical thrombectomy, there were no serious complications of surgery. Forty-five of the 526 patients (8.6%) had a decreased or absent pulse after catheterization. Of these 45 patients, 32 (71.1%) improved with systemic heparinization only. Thirteen patients (28.9%) had a persistently absent pedal pulse suggesting femoral artery thrombosis, despite continuous heparinization. Eleven patients were successfully treated with thrombolytic therapy and two required surgical thrombectomy. Intraarterial balloon dilatation procedures were performed in 8 of these 13 patients. Prothrombin time was prolonged (11.5 +/- 1.06 to 52.3 +/- 40.4 seconds; p less than 0.025) and fibrinogen levels were significantly reduced (2.25 +/- 0.79 to 1.52 +/- 0.52 gm/dl; p less than 0.01) during therapy. There were no serious complications, although four patients bled from the groin entry site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients, mean age 72 years, with aortic valve stenosis were studied by ultrafast CT 1 day after cardiac catheterization. After injection of radiographic contrast material through a peripheral vein, two contiguous eight-level R wave-triggered cine mode scans in the short axis were acquired, starting above the aortic valve and continuing through the apex of the left ventricle. Seven of eight patients, all with calcified aortic valves, had a detectable central orifice. Catheterization-derived aortic valve areas were within 0.25 cm2 of the CT valve areas in six of seven. LV mass was measured by ultrafast CT in the eight patients with aortic valve stenosis (121.6 +/- 18.2 gm/m2) and was found to be significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) than that in a group of eight subjects with normal LV function, no history of hypertension, and normal ECGs (73.0 +/- 13.1 gm/m2). It is concluded that in selected cases ultrafast CT can contribute to the assessment of severity of calcific aortic stenosis by measurement of LV mass and valve area.\r"
