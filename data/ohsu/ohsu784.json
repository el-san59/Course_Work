  ".W": "To gain further insight into the possible generalized nature of intracellular calcium-related alterations in hypertension we measured free cytosolic calcium (iCa2+) in lymphocytes obtained from the spleen and the blood of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. By monitoring Fura-2 fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm we estimated; Ca2+. In peripheral lymphocytes from the SHR iCa2+ was increased as compared to those from WKY rats (146 +/- 14 and 112 +/- 6.0 nm, respectively, P less than .025). In contrast, in lymphocytes obtained from the spleen, iCa2+ was not different between SHR and WKY rats (93 +/- 7.0 and 96 +/- 8.0 nm, respectively). When spleen cells were subjected to selective B lymphocyte depletion to generate a preparation of predominantly T lymphocytes, iCa2+ was found to be higher in SHR than in WKY rats (149 +/- 23 and 89 +/- 12 nm, respectively, P less than .05). The finding that iCa2+ is elevated in peripheral lymphocytes and spleen cells subjected to B cell depletion but not in untreated spleen cells indicates that T, but not B, lymphocytes have increased iCa2+ in the SHR. This observation may be related to existing evidence that T lymphocyte function is impaired in the SHR. An increase in iCa2+ is not a phenomenon generalized to all cells of this model of genetic hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "A high calcium intake has been shown to attenuate the degree of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and some human hypertensives. Conversely, a low calcium intake has been associated with an increase in blood pressure in both groups. In the present study, the effects of a high (2%), medium (0.6%) and low (0.02%) calcium diet on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and on the expression of a novel circulating hypertensive factor--parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF)--were examined in SHR. In rats on the low calcium diet, MAP and PHF activity were significantly higher at 8 weeks than in the other two groups. In the high calcium group, MAP was significantly lower than in the other two groups, although it was elevated compared to week 0 values. PHF activity was not detected in the plasma of this high calcium group. Overall, MAP was highly correlated with PHF activity (r = 0.78, P = .0001). These results suggest that the effects of dietary calcium on blood pressure in SHR may be mediated by a novel circulating hypertensive factor, PHF, such that a high calcium diet inhibits, and a low calcium diet stimulates, the expression of this factor.\r"

We have analyzed the effect of age on the response of the blood pressure to the removal of the cause of hypertension in groups of patients with primary aldosteronism, renovascular hypertension, Cushing's syndrome and hypothyroid hypertension. In the patients studied, surgical or medical elimination of the mechanism responsible for the hypertension when the patients were below the age of 40 reduced diastolic blood pressure 1 to 2 years later to below 90 mm Hg in 24 of 25 patients. In the patients who were treated when they were over 40 years of age, blood pressure remained above 90 mm Hg after corrective treatment in 23 of 61 individuals (38%). In the 4 groups studied there was a significant correlation between age and post-treatment systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure. The findings indicate the importance of correcting secondary hypertension at an early age.\r"

Each of 518 adult volunteers had two randomly ordered systolic and diastolic Vita-Stat blood pressure measurements compared with two corresponding measurements obtained by a trained observer using a Random-Zero sphygmomanometer. Eight of the ten Vita-Stat recorders underestimated systolic blood pressure. In contrast, diastolic blood pressure was overestimated by nine of the ten machines. While the overall differences in average blood pressure were small (mean +/- SEM = -2.4 +/- 0.6 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and +2.3 +/- 0.4 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure), the magnitude of the average discrepancy varied considerably by machine (+4.7 to -13.8 mm Hg for systolic and +5.0 to -2.0 for diastolic blood pressure). At every level of systolic and diastolic blood pressure the Vita-Stat ABPR provided a less accurate method of classifying blood pressure among individuals than the human observer. Additional analyses exploring the ability of the Vita-Stat machine to measure an individual's blood pressure within 2, 4, or 6 mm Hg of the corresponding Random-Zero value again suggested that the Vita-Stat ABPR was less accurate than the human observer. Duplicate Vita-Stat readings were less repeatable than corresponding Random-Zero measurements. Based on the findings of this study, the Vita-Stat ABPR appears to be an unsatisfactory tool for community-based self-measurement of blood pressure.\r"

Three other diets (II, III, VI) derived the majority of calories from refined CHO, sucrose or glucose, with decreases in calories from proteins or fats. The last two diets (IV, V) were relatively low in sucrose with a higher percentage of the total calories from proteins and fats, respectively. From 3 to 15 weeks on the diets, the highest average BP was in rats consuming high concentrations of sucrose or glucose (II, III, VI). Urinary excretory rates of norepinephrine (NE) at 5, 10 and 15 weeks and epinephrine at 5 and 10 weeks were significantly elevated in rats ingesting diets high in refined CHO, and NE positively correlated with blood pressure (BP) at 5 and 10 weeks of the study. At the end of the study, serum insulin levels were not different, but plasma renin and serum glucagon levels were lower in SHR consuming the diets with high CHO concentrations. We conclude that equally elevated BP are seen with relatively high intakes of either sucrose or glucose, whether the balance of calories is derived from lessening fat or protein. This is secondary, at least in part, to alterations in NE metabolism.\r"

They were divided into two groups on the basis of BP changes: 18 patients whose BP values were elevated by more than 10% after discharge (group I; mean +16.9%, P less than .01) and the remaining 14 patients (group II; -3.6%, P = NS). Urinary Na excretion (UNaV) in Group I patients increased markedly after discharge (83 v 189 mu Eq/min, P less than .001) while it did not change in Group II (122 v 102 mu Eq/min, P = NS), resulting in a greater postdischarge UNaV in group I than in group II (P less than .01). The changes in BP were positively correlated with the overall changes in UNaV (r = 0.45, P less than .01). Plasma epinephrine after discharge was higher in group I than in group II (31 v 18 pg/mL, P less than .05). Thus, increases in NaCl intake seem to play an important role in BP elevation after discharge. Adrenal medullary function may partly contribute also to the BP elevation.\r"

The specific goal of the present investigation was to study the impact of chronic heat treatment on the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive mice. Chronic 40 degrees C heat exposure for 5 min daily progressively lowered basal blood pressure in hypertensive mice within 20 days, without any change in normal mice. In fact, after 35 days of chronic heat treatment, the basal blood pressure of hypertensive mice was indistinguishable from that of the normotensives. Repeated immobilization and prewarming as normal procedures for recording blood pressure contributed to the decrease in blood pressure by 10 to 12 mm Hg, but chronic heat by itself was significantly more potent in reducing it by an additional 20 mm Hg. After the discontinuation of chronic heat application, the basal blood pressure of hypertensive mice returned with time to the level registered in sham-handled hypertensive controls. These results demonstrate that, although acute heat is more detrimental to hypertensive mice, brief, chronic exposure to mild heat stress is beneficial in that it normalizes basal blood pressure.\r"

In the upright position wintertime blood pressures increased by 3% (P = NS) over summer values whereas cardiac output and stroke volume decreased by 18% and 21%, respectively (P less than .0017 for each). Similarly, wintertime upright heart rate increased by 7% (P less than .017) with larger parallel increases in systemic vascular resistance (+24%, P less than .0017) and plasma norepinephrine (+26%, P less than .017). The supine values followed similar trends but the magnitude of changes was about 50% less than the corresponding upright values. Thus, in the northern US, wintertime vasoconstriction is related to increased sympathetic nervous activity and decreased cardiac output. When these reciprocal changes are proportional, blood pressure remains constant.\r"

We have followed the long-term fate of individual clones of mouse THSC from fetal liver or adult bone marrow, after labeling in culture, followed by engraftment and serial transplantation in unirradiated W/Wv-C57BL/6 hosts. The ancestor cell of each clone and its mitotic progeny were uniquely identifiable retrospectively by the DNA integration pattern experimentally produced by replication-incompetent recombinant murine retroviruses. These viruses provided physiologically neutral markers. The marked clones proved to be derived from THSC, based on their contributions to a wide array of myeloid and lymphoid blood lineages in the hosts. The label also identified the target cells as the population displaying clonal succession. The various labeled stem cell clones proliferated for substantially different periods of time. The longest observed clone endured, after the original cell was marked, for at least 2 1/2 years--the equivalent of a mouse's lifetime. However, the results suggest that THSC clones are not all long-lived and that even the longest-lived ones may not be potentially immortal. Thus, the unpredictable lifespan of any given THSC clone indicates the desirability of introducing multiple clones in therapeutic transplants.\r"

Our clinical approach to these patients involved a strategy whereby lymphomatous nodes greater than 2 cm in diameter that persisted despite salvage chemotherapy were given boost radiation therapy immediately before chemo-ablation. However, patients with this variable had a significantly lower survival due to septic complications rather than recurrent disease. We conclude that the treatment strategy used in this study with some modification may improve further on the already high probability of long-term disease-free survival experienced by this group of patients.\r"

The addition of IL-6 to a culture containing interleukin-3 (IL-3) resulted in a significant increase in the number of megakaryocyte colonies by bone marrow cells of normal mice. The megakaryocytic progenitors that survive exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) exhibited a more significant response to IL-6 and IL-3. Polyclonal anti-IL-6 antibody neutralized the stimulatory effect of IL-6 on megakaryocyte colony growth supported by IL-3. Delayed addition experiments and replating experiments of blast cell colonies showed that megakaryocytic progenitors are supported by IL-3 in the early stage of the development but require IL-6 for their subsequent proliferation and differentiation. In addition, IL-6 increased the size of megakaryocytes in granulocyte-macrophage-megakaryocyte colonies. The combination of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor with IL-3 resulted in an increase in the granulocyte-macrophage colony growth of bone marrow cells of 5-FU-treated mice or normal mice, respectively, but had little effect on the enhancement of pure and mixed megakaryocyte colony growth. These results suggest that IL-6 plays an important role in murine megakaryocytopoiesis.\r"

It is expressed on 1% to 4% of normal bone marrow cells, including colony forming units of all lineages and their precursors. CD34 expression is lost during hematopoietic development and is not found on mature peripheral blood cells. The control of CD34 expression was studied in the myeloblast cell line KG-1 as a model for the regulation of stem cell genes. CD34 mRNA was expressed at high levels in uninduced KG-1 cells. Upon induction of the cells towards macrophages with tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and ionomycin, steady state levels of CD34 mRNA decreased rapidly. Nuclear run-on assays did not show a significant change in the rate of CD34 transcription upon induction. The half-life of CD34 mRNA was 4.5 hours in uninduced KG-1 cells and 2.25 hours in induced cells, demonstrating the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms in CD34 downregulation. Cycloheximide had no effect on the downregulation of CD34, suggesting that labile proteins are not required for this process. This model should allow the study of some of the regulatory mechanisms controlling early events in hematopoiesis.\r"

Thrombospondin synthesis is differentially regulated in human long-term bone marrow cultures. Consistent with this, human hematopoietic progenitor cells of all three lineages (erythrocyte, megakaryocyte, and granulocyte) use TSP as an attachment protein. However, terminally differentiated cells (erythrocytes and neutrophils) show absent or reduced attachment to TSP. The region within the TSP molecule that mediates cell attachment (cell binding domain) was delineated by examining both attachment to proteolytic fragments of TSP and by inhibition of cytoadhesion using monoclonal antibodies directed against TSP domains. The cell binding domain resides toward the C-terminus of a 140 Kd chymotryptic fragment of TSP. We conclude that thrombospondin functions as a hematopoietic cytoadhesion molecule, capable of binding primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, and may, therefore, be important in blood cell development.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages have been shown to directly influence the growth and development of mature erythroid progenitors (CFU-E) in normal and erythroleukemic mice. We examined the mechanism by which macrophages mediate their effect on in vivo erythropoiesis. As reported for whole macrophages, serum-free supernatants (SN) from normal resident peritoneal macrophages suppressed in vivo normal and conventional Friend virus (CFV)-infected CFU-E and caused clinical regression of CFV-induced leukemia in mice. Macrophage SN had no effect on the erythropoietin (EPO)-independent CFU-E characteristic of infection with the polycythemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FVP), or progression of FVP leukemia. Using biochemical, immunologic, and functional assays, the erythrosuppressive factor in macrophage SN was identified as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). The in vivo erythroid suppressive effects of macrophages, macrophage SN, and IL-1 alpha were reversed by simultaneous treatment with EPO. IL-1 alpha itself had no effect on CFU-E colony formation in vitro. Pretreatment of animals with antibodies to murine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) completely abrogated the suppression of CFU-E by macrophages, macrophage SN, or human recombinant IL-1 alpha. These results suggest that macrophages regulate erythropoiesis by production of IL-1 alpha, which in turn mediates its in vivo suppressive effects on CFU-E through TNF.\r"

  ".U": "90275262\r", 
  ".W": "The human Baka/Bakb alloantigen system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of post-transfusion purpura and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Human alloantisera specific for either the Baka or Bakb allele have been shown to react exclusively with the heavy chain of membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb. To investigate the structure of the Bak epitopes, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify GPIIb cDNA synthesized from platelet RNA samples prepared from individuals of known serologic phenotype. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis of amplified GPIIb cDNAs derived from one Baka homozygous individual and one Bakb homozygous individual revealed a single nucleotide base difference near the 3' end of the mRNA encoding the GPIIb heavy chain. Short 13 base allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO) containing the putative phenotype-specific base in the middle were then synthesized, end-labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP using terminal transferase, and used as probes in subsequent dot-blot hybridization experiments. Platelet RNA was prepared from a panel made up of four Baka/a, three Bakb/b, and two Baka/b individuals, and the mRNA encoding GPIIb was amplified using PCR and spotted onto nylon membranes. ASO hybridization showed that the nucleotide base difference identified above segregated with Bak phenotype in all nine individuals examined (P = .002). The base pair substitution results in an amino acid polymorphism at residue 843 of the mature heavy chain. The Baka form of GPIIb encodes an isoleucine at this position, whereas the Bakb allele contains a serine. Identification of the polymorphism associated with this clinically important alloantigen system should permit new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches for treating and managing patients with alloimmune thrombocytopenic disorders.\r"

We have developed a rapid and simple method for isolation of the protein from platelet extracts using a combination of gel permeation, anion-exchange, and lectin affinity chromatography. The partial amino acid sequence was determined by analysis of peptides generated by digestion of the S-carboxyamido-methylated protein with Achromobacter protease I or cyanogen bromide. The sequence shows a remarkable periodicity of leucine residues, which is homologous to the consensus sequence of a highly diversified protein super-family with a common repetitive module. Thrombin cleavage site was determined to be located at the C-terminal region of GPV by analysis of the products separated by sizing and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. By lectin blot analysis, the existence of mucin-type carbohydrate chains was indicated, as well as the existence of asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains shown by the amino acid sequence analysis. From these data, we report a structural model of GPV that is analogous to glycoprotein Ib.\r"

  ".U": "90275264\r", 
  ".W": "The underlying molecular basis for Bernard-Soulier Disease (BSD) is currently unknown. Platelets from patients with this autosomal recessive bleeding disorder have multiple abnormalities, including a markedly reduced von Willebrand factor-dependent adhesiveness due to a deficiency of the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complex. In the present studies, we have used an intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for Taq I in the GPIb alpha gene to study linkage between this gene and the inheritance of BSD in a family with two affected siblings. Whereas the proband was heterozygous, showing both the 0.7 and 4.0 kb bands of this polymorphism (A/B), her affected brother was homozygous for the 0.7 kb band (A/A). Accordingly, these siblings did not inherit the same pair of GPIb alpha alleles from their parents. Additionally, one child of the proband was A/A, while the second studied child was A/B, with neither showing any evidence of BSD. No construct of heterozygosity or homozygosity for GPIb alpha alleles in this family is consistent with a model in which one or more defective GPIb alpha alleles could produce BSD. RFLP analysis with BamHI or HindIII showed entirely normal patterns in the patients, indicating the absence of any gross deletion of the GPIb alpha gene. GPIb alpha mRNA from patient platelets was reverse transcribed and subsequently amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, demonstrating the presence of GPIb alpha transcript. Furthermore, trace amounts of GPIb could be shown on the surface of patient platelets. Based on these results, a defect in the GPIb alpha gene is unlikely to be the cause of BSD in this family.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital thrombocytopenia may occur in isolation or accompanied by eczema and immunodeficiency, as part of the X-linked hereditary Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Because the clinical and immunologic picture of WAS is variable, particularly early in life, definite diagnosis cannot always be made in cases with a negative family history. Two unrelated males with sporadic congenital thrombocytopenia had only questionable immunologic abnormalities as infants, making them clinically indistinguishable from cases of isolated thrombocytopenia, although one developed episodic neutropenia and the other began to manifest a multisystem autoimmune disease at 2 years of age. Evaluation of X chromosome inactivation in the T cells of both patients' mothers showed each of these women to have the same highly skewed X chromosome inactivation pattern seen in carriers of typical familial WAS. A T-cell defect was subsequently directly demonstrated in the second patient, whose lymphocytes failed to proliferate to periodate and anti-CD43. Taken together, these data suggest the presence of T cell immunodeficiency consistent with WAS in these patients. Furthermore, their mothers were found to have a very high likelihood of being carriers, lending support to the diagnosis of a hereditary disease in these boys and making possible genetic prediction in other family members and subsequent pregnancies.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody, 1D10, was derived that identifies a new antigenic epitope on the surface of malignant B lymphocytes. Normal resting and stimulated lymphocytes do not express the antigen. The majority of individuals with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection express the antigen on their lymphocytes, and in these patients, the T lymphocyte may also be antigen positive. The antigen was found on B-lymphoid neoplasia from the early pre-B cell stage through terminally differentiated plasma cells, a characteristic not reported for other B cell-associated antigens. Studies on homozygous typing cells and cells from individuals with known HLA phenotypes indicate that the antigen does not segregate in a pattern characteristic for major histocompatibility antigens. The molecule is a heterodimeric polypeptide with the molecular weight and isoelectric points of the alpha and beta chains being 32,000 d/4 and 28,000 d/6, respectively. Evidence is presented that the 1D10 molecule is not HLA-DR, -DP, or -DQ. By extrapolation, we suggest that this novel molecule may represent HLA D-region gene expression of a gene(s) not normally expressed. Potential candidates are D-region pseudogenes. We conclude that the antigenic epitope identified by the 1D10 monoclonal antibody is unique among previously described B-lymphocyte antigens. Further studies of the factors controlling the expression of this molecule, as well as studies designed to look at the possible cellular function, may provide insights for understanding crucial events in the malignant transformation of lymphocytes.\r"

While Fc gamma RIII is reported to be a phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked, rather than peptide-linked, protein on neutrophils and NK cells, its membrane linkage in macrophages has not been studied. We examined the sensitivity of Fc gamma RIII to cleavage by PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) in cultured monocytes and alveolar tissue macrophages and report that this receptor is not PI-linked on these cells. We also observed normal levels of Fc gamma RIII on cultured monocytes of a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a disease in which PI-linked proteins are deficient. The results suggest that Fc gamma RIII occurs solely in a transmembrane form in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. In addition, we studied Fc gamma RIII on a cloned NK cell line and found it to be resistant to the effects of PI-PLC under conditions that cleaved Fc gamma RIII on neutrophils. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a distinct form of Fc gamma RIII that differs from the neutrophil receptor in its structure and, possibly, in its function.\r"

  ".W": "All seven of a set of CD34 monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes on an approximately 110 Kd glycoprotein on human hemopoietic progenitor cells also bind to vascular endothelium. Capillaries of most tissues are CD34 positive, as are umbilical artery and, to a lesser extent, vein, but the endothelium of most large vessels and the endothelium of placental sinuses are not. Angioblastoma cells and parafollicular mesenchymal cells in fetal skin are also CD34 positive, as are some stromal elements. An approximately 110 Kd protein can be identified by Western blot analysis with CD34 antibodies in detergent extracts of freshly isolated umbilical vessel endothelial cells, and CD34 mRNA is present in cultured umbilical vein cells as well as other tissues rich in vascular endothelium (breast, placenta). These data indicate that the binding of CD34 antibodies to vascular endothelium is to the CD34 gene product, and not to crossreactive epitopes. Despite the presence of CD34 mRNA in cultured, proliferating endothelial cells, the latter do not bind CD34 antibodies. In addition, CD34 antigen cannot be upregulated by growth factors. We conclude that under these conditions, CD34 protein is downregulated or processed into another form that is unreactive with CD34 antibodies. Electron microscopy of umbilical artery, breast, and kidney capillary vessels reveals that in all three sites, CD34 molecules are concentrated on membrane processes, many of which interdigitate between adjacent endothelial cells. However, well-established endothelial cell contacts with tight junctions are CD34 negative. CD34 may function as an adhesion molecule on both endothelial cells and hematopoietic progenitors.\r"

GDF is heat labile (56 degrees C for 30 minutes) and acid labile (pH 2.0) and is sensitive to treatment with bacterial protease type IV. Our preliminary studies suggest that GDF is non-dialyzable (molecular weight cutoff, 12,000), binds to diethylaminoethyl (DEAE), and has an apparent molecular weight (mol wt) of about 40 Kd. Production of GDF is unaffected by treatment of PMN with activating agents (interferon gamma, OK432, phorbol ester, calcium ionophore, poly I:C) or metabolic inhibitors (actinomycin-D and cyclohexamide), suggesting that GDF is constitutively secreted. Despite the marked enhancement of 3H-thymidine uptake, cell number and the rate of DNA synthesis in GDF responsive cultures remain unchanged. In contrast, the clonogenic efficiency of the responsive cells is greatly increased in the presence of GDF. These phenomena occur in parallel to an amplification of the level of thymidine kinase activity in the sensitive cells. GDF is distinct from a panel of different lymphokines and monokines in antigenicity and biochemical and functional characteristics, and is possibly a novel cytokine that can alter the pattern of DNA synthesis and growth characteristics of certain hematopoietic cells. However, its biologic and physiologic significance remains to be determined.\r"

The possible mechanisms involved in the increased uptake of Ca2+ were investigated: activation of Ca2+ channels, involvement of the anion channel, and the formation of endocytic vacuoles. The Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine reduced the deoxy-stimulated Ca2+ uptake by about 30% to 40%. The anion channel inhibitor DIDS (4,4' diisothiocyanate stilbene 2,2' disulfonate) inhibited the deoxy-stimulated Ca2+ uptake by approximately 50%. Maximal possible endocytic uptake, measured by using an impermeant marker ([3H] inuline), accounted for 6% to 9% of the total Ca2+ uptake. These data indicate that the deoxygenation-induced increase in Ca2+ permeability could result from both the activation of a Ca2+ channel and of a transport system for cations involving interactions between polymerized hemoglobin S, band 3 and other membrane components. Endocytosis appears to play only a minor role in the Ca2+ uptake of deoxygenated sickle cells.\r"

We analyzed risk factors for chronic GVHD in 2,534 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants surviving at least 90 days after transplantation. The actuarial probability of developing chronic GVHD within three years posttransplant was 46% +/- 3% (95% confidence interval). The most important risk factor for chronic GVHD was acute GVHD. The 3-year probabilities of chronic GVHD were 28% +/- 3%, 49% +/- 5%, 59% +/- 6%, 80% +/- 9%, and 85% +/- 15% for persons with grades 0, I, II, III, and IV acute GVHD, respectively (P less than .0001). Among patients with no or grade I acute GVHD, recipient age greater than 20 years, use of non-T-cell depleted bone marrow, and alloimmune female donors for male recipients predicted a higher risk of chronic GVHD. When all three adverse risk factors were present, the probability of chronic GVHD was 62% among persons with no prior acute GVHD and 85% among those with grade I acute GVHD. Among patients with grade II through IV acute GVHD, no other risk factor predicted chronic GVHD. These data identify individuals who might benefit from treatment strategies aimed at changing the incidence of chronic GVHD.\r"

Of 339 parents who agreed to answer questions after being given details of their child's \"death\" 288 (85%) said that they would be willing to donate their child's organs. The degree of willingness was associated with the certainty of death, altruism and empathy toward children in need of an organ, previous discussion of organ donation with a family member and knowledge of an adolescent or adult child's attitude toward donation. Factors that inhibited the intention to donate included uncertainty of death, insufficient information from medical professionals and fear of multilation. The child's age was not significantly associated with intention to donate. Concordance between the results and actual donation rates in Canada and the United States supports the generalizability of the survey findings.\r"

Few preoperative investigations were required, management being based on histology. Effective local control requires a total parotidectomy preserving the facial nerve where possible. It should be followed by routine radiotherapy which appears to reduce the incidence of local recurrence. The rate of local recurrence also depends on the histological type. It is seen more frequently in an adenocarcinoma following a pleomorphic adenoma than in simple adenocarcinoma. Patients with inoperable disease are treated with radiotherapy alone as chemotherapy has not so far been effective. Percentage 5-year survival for the three most common tumour types is as follows: adenocarcinoma: 49; adenoid cystic carcinoma: 83, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma: 75.\r"

Of these patients, 763 were previously untreated and had a histologically proved squamous cell carcinoma. The interaction between the host factors (age, sex and general condition) and other tumour factors, and the effect of the host factors on survival were analysed. The maximum age incidence was the same in the two sexes but performance status (general condition) declined with increasing age. There was no relation between age and site or histological grade of the tumour. However, the incidence of T3-T4 tumours increased up to the seventh decade and then declined again. Age was not a significant predictor of survival when allowance was made for patients who were untreated, or who had died of intercurrent disease or a second primary tumour. Men were more likely to have a glottic tumour: these tumours presented at an earlier stage and were likely to be well differentiated, mainly because glottic T1 carcinoma is almost exclusively a male disease. When individual sites are examined the crude survival for supraglottic tumours in women is better than that in men because of a higher death rate from other diseases and other tumours in men. Sex had no other effect on survival. Good performance status was associated with lower T-stage but not quite significantly so. It was not associated with any other tumour parameters. Performance status significantly affected survival of treated patients, probably indicating that general condition affects the patient's ability to resist his tumour.\r"

In 121 patients (222 ears) pneumatic otoscopy with a Seigles speculum and tympanometry were performed prior to myringotomy. An immobile tympanic membrane on otoscopy, or a Jerger type B curve on tympanometry were considered indicative of a middle ear effusion. There was no significant difference (P greater than 0.05) between the predictive value of pneumatic otoscopy (88%) and tympanometry (89%). When pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry were used in conjunction, the predictive accuracy did not increase significantly. Pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry are simple and reliable methods of predicting the presence or absence of a middle ear effusion. Their use together did not increase diagnostic accuracy.\r"

For juvenile papillomas the incidence rate was 3.62 x 10(-6), compared with 3.94 x 10(-6) for laryngeal papillomas of adult onset. When comparing different time periods a significantly low incidence was found in the time 1965-1968, while the incidence remained constant in 1969-1984. The low incidence rate in the early period may be real, but selectional bias may have played a part. It is general anticipated that maternal genital HPV-infections may serve as an HPV-reservoir, and that juvenile laryngeal papillomas is a result of HPV transmission from the mother to the child during birth. In the period in question cervical HPV-infections have been recorded with increasing frequency in younger women, indicating that the prevalence is rising. However, this is not reflected in the incidence of laryngeal papillomas.\r"

Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcaemia (FHH) has emerged as an important condition to distinguish from primary hyperparathyroidism as a cause of hypercalcaemia. Patients with FHH are usually asymptomatic, have similar biochemical findings to primary hyperparathyroidism, but fail to respond to parathyroid surgery. We have studied 15 members of a large kindred with FHH. The initial diagnosis was made in the propositus after a failed neck exploration for presumed primary hyperparathyroidism. Of the 7 affected members, 2 had recurrent acute pancreatitis and 2 had incidental malignant disease with no evidence of bony involvement. Measurement of the calcium: creatinine clearance ratio provides a good method of identifying hypercalcaemic patients who might have FHH. A ratio of less than 0.013 is an indication to screen first-degree relatives before considering neck exploration.\r"

This significant age difference suggests that contact hypersensitivity is not an aetiological factor in the younger patient. There was no significant difference in the duration of otitis externa between those with positive and negative tests. This feature has not been previously examined or reported. Neomycin was the commonest sensitizing agent, sensitization occurring in 12 (32%) patients.\r"

This protocol, although sensitive lacks specificity and results in a high incidence of normal CT air meatograms. As this procedure is associated with a significant morbidity, we have devised a 'weighted' system of scoring to avoid subjecting large numbers of normal patients to CT air meatography. The proposed system has been derived from screening 61 patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, 24 of whom had an acoustic neuroma. This method reduced the false positive rate of CT air meatography from 68%, using the 2 out of 3 criteria, to 18%, whilst the false negative incidence remained at 8%.\r"

Light microscopy revealed diffuse lobular accentuation of glomerular tufts, occupied by homogeneous material which was eosinophilic, lightly stained with periodic acid silver methenamine and deeply with aniline blue. Further examinations using an electron microscope after treatment with phosphotungstic acid revealed that this material exhibited a diffuse increase in fibers having a periodicity of 65 +/- 4 nm (mean +/- SD) like type III collagen fibers and was reactive to the anti-type III collagen monoclonal antibody. In addition, the serum level of procollagen III peptides was markedly elevated to 221 ng/dl (normal range 2-13 ng/dl). However, the fibers were peculiarly curved and frayed as reported in the nail-patella syndrome, but were not observed in the lamina densa of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) as seen in this syndrome. No family history or physical findings of bony and nail dystrophy, no laboratory data or pathological findings compatible with already described renal diseases including mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis, light chain disease, immunotactoid nephropathy, amyloidosis, and non-amyloidotic fibrillary glomerulonephritis were observed. These data strongly suggest that the nephropathy is caused by a primary increase in atypical type III collagen fibers in glomeruli (primary glomerular fibrosis), which to our knowledge has not yet been described in the English literature.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the macro scale SDS-PAGE technique, which has been used for the last two decades, with semiautomated electrophoresis using an ultrathin SDS-PAA gel with silver staining (Phast system). The new system proved to be quick and easy to handle. Separation of proteins in the range of 70-320 kD were of comparable quality to the macro scale system (unselective and selective glomerular proteinurias with 68 to 150 and 68 to 350 kD components, respectively, as well as total serum proteins), but there was considerable improvement regarding the quality and visibility of protein bands in the range of 11-70 kD. This improvement led to a new classification of micromolecular protein bands into three groups: the smallest microproteins (11-22 kD), the larger microproteins (23-40 kD) and the largest microproteins (41-68 kD). Thereby it was possible to obtain an improved definition of electrophoretic patterns of urinary proteins, which is described in detail.\r"

We report clearance studies in 5 cases of hyponatremia and hypouricemia that were not due to SIADH. One had metastatic pancreatic carcinoma with ascites, edema, hypoalbuminemia and hypophosphatemia. Two had adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastasis to the brain in 1, 1 had disseminated cryptococcus and 1 had Hodgkin's disease. None received radiation or known nephrotoxins at least 4 months prior to study. None had serum creatinine greater than 106.1 mumol/l (1.2 mg/dl). Two had postural hypotension and hyponatremia that responded to saline therapy. Fluid restriction corrected the hyponatremia in all patients, but the hypouricemia, high fractional excretion (FE) of urate, and high urine sodium concentration persisted. In 2 patients studied, ADH was appropriately suppressed after volume repletion but there was a defect in free water clearance due to high renal solute excretion. In contrast to patients with SIADH who correct their defect in renal urate transport with correction of hyponatremia by water restriction, our patients appear to have a persistent renal urate transport defect and abnormality in sodium conservation. Elevated FE urate of greater than 10% after correction of hyponatremia can thus differentiate these patients from SIADH. The diametrically opposing goals of fluid therapy emphasize the importance of differentiating one group from the other.\r"

  ".W": "We describe the use of fludrocortisone in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, who initially presented with moderate renal insufficiency, high serum potassium, metabolic acidosis, low urine pH, and a high urinary anion gap indicating tubular dysfunction. Renal histology revealed membranous glomerulonephritis and interstitial inflammation. During the course of the disease the patient developed persistent severe hyperkalemia. Dietary potassium restriction and therapy with diuretics combined with cation exchange resins failed to decrease potassium levels sufficiently. Drug therapy including cyclosporin A, enalapril, atenolol, phenytoin, necessary to control active disease and severe hypertension contributed to elevated potassium levels. Effective correction of hyperkalemia was achieved by fludrocortisone treatment. We conclude that fludrocortisone is a potent therapeutic approach for selected patients suffering from life threatening hyperkalemia, in whom potassium elevating drugs cannot be withdrawn.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been suggested that selective parathyroidectomy modifies drug-induced acute renal failure. In the present study, we tested whether parathyroid hormone (PTH) could play a role in the pathogenesis of cisplatin (CP) nephrotoxicity. Parathyroidectomized rats (PTX) with normal blood calcium, were injected with two different doses of CP (group Ia: 10 mg/kg and group Ib: 6 mg/kg) and their renal functions were evaluated after 72 hours (group 1 a) and 120 h (group 1 b), respectively. All animals exhibited a milder course of acute renal failure when compared to sham-PTX CP treated rats, with lower serum creatinines (SCr) (group Ia: 1.99 +/- 0.14 vs 2.91 +/- 0.56 mg/dl, p less than 0.05) (group Ib: 1.45 +/- 0.08 vs 1.80 +/- 0.09 mg/dl, p less than 0.05) and blood urea (BUN) (group Ia: 76 +/- 5 vs 115 +/- 19 mg/dl, p less than 0.05) (group Ib: 70 +/- 9 vs 88 +/- 10 mg/dl p less than 0.05). Furthermore, the i.p. administration of PTH (50 I.U. twice daily for 9 days) to normal rats treated with CP (6 mg/kg) aggravated the CP-induced ARF as compared to vehicle injected animals (SCr 2.23 +/- 0.16 vs 1.63 +/- 0.19 mg/dl, p less than 0.05 and BUN 153 +/- 22 vs 97 +/- 20 mg/dl, p less than 0.05). Treatment with the calcium channel blocker verapamil (4 mg/kg) nine days before and three days after CP (4 mg/kg) administration, had no significant effect on cisplatin nephrotoxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The Hct rose from 23% to 31% in a mean treatment time of 7 weeks, or a rate of rise of 1.2% per week. Three of the patients had previously been transfusion dependent. One of these patients and two additional had iron overload (ferritin level greater than 2,000 ng/ml). The drug was paid for by Medicaid (two patients) or private insurance, with the patient paying the uncovered portion, generally 20%. Side effects were minimal. Low dose subcutaneous erythropoietin is effective in CAPD patients.\r"

The BUN obtained from the inlet line needle 15 minutes after conclusion of the treatment did not differ significantly from the BUN concentration in the specimen from a contralateral arm drawn five minutes before termination of dialysis.

The remaining two negative scans corroborated only by clinical course, CBC, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, 10 follow-up scans were performed in six of the 39 patients to monitor therapy or investigate a change in symptoms. As an anatomic indicator of acute granulocytic infiltration of the intestinal lamina propria and crypts, the authors found that this scan had a 97 percent rate of sensitivity and 100 percent specificity. Specific indications for the use of the indium 111-labeled granulocyte scan are described. For the authors, in general, this test has become a vital adjunct to endoscopy and radiography in the diagnosis and management of patients with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Progress of the 32 women and 18 men with a median age of 60 years (range, 50 to 78 years) was followed for a median of 95.5 months (range, 81.1 to 236.6 months). The most common presenting signs and symptoms were abdominal pain (82 percent), diarrhea (70 percent), weight loss (56 percent), bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (26 percent), abdominal mass (16 percent), and fistula (14 percent). Initial operations performed were ileocolic resection (38 percent), proctocolectomy (16 percent), small bowel resection (10 percent), colostomy (2 percent), and a variety of segmental resections of the colon (34 percent). The overall recurrence rate of disease in patients in whom all obvious disease was resected, based on distribution of disease, was 80 percent (ileocolitis), 38 percent (ileitis), and 35 percent (colitis). Crohn's disease more often affects the distal gastrointestinal tract in older age groups. After resection, however, the clinical course is similar to that of the younger population. The high recurrence rate of Crohn's colitis is probably a result of the large number of initial segmental resections.\r"

The effects of this operation in these rats were compared with a control group undergoing conventional ileostomy (I). Rats in the I group lost weight throughout follow-up, whereas rats in the I-I group regained weight and were significantly heavier four weeks after surgery. Transit time from the stomach to the stoma was significantly prolonged in the I-I group (187 +/- 29 minutes) when compared with the I group (141 +/- 17 minutes, P less than 0.01). Serum analysis revealed no significant differences in total protein, lipids, electrolytes (Na, Cl, CO2), and osmolarity between the groups. Biliary bile salt concentration, normalized bile flow, and normalized bile acid output in the I-I group were not different from those in unoperated control rats, suggesting unimpaired bile acid metabolism. These data suggest this operative procedure has the beneficial effects of slowing intestinal transit and promoting postoperative recovery without impairing distal ileal function.\r"

  ".W": "Anal canal manometry is performed conventionally with balloons, sleeves, perfused or nonperfused open-tipped catheters, or with multiport probes. The authors constructed a new manometer with four transducers embedded in a probe (15 mm outside diameter) and oriented radially, 90 degrees apart. The transducer probe was validated in 27 healthy volunteers by comparing its performance to that of a standard four-port perfused manometer and then used to measure anal canal and rectal pressures in body positions more physiologic (standing, sitting) than that usually employed (left lateral) for such measurements. Both devices measured similar anal canal resting pressure in the left lateral position (mid canal, 58 +/- 3 mm Hg perfused vs. 62 +/- 4 mm Hg transducer; P greater than 0.05). The transducer probe, however, recorded higher squeeze pressures (mid canal, 100 +/- 6 mm Hg perfused vs. 143 +/- 14 mm Hg transducer; P less than 0.05). The transducer probe detected higher intrarectal and resting anal canal pressures when subjects were standing or sitting, compared with the left lateral position (rectum, 3 +/- 1 mm Hg left lateral; 17 +/- 2 mm Hg standing; 20 +/- 1 mm Hg sitting; P less than 0.05; mid anal canal, 57 +/- 3 mm Hg left lateral; 86 +/- 4 mm Hg standing; 81 +/- 5 mm Hg sitting, P less than 0.05). The rise in resting anal canal pressure was uniform circumferentially. Neither anal canal length nor squeeze pressure changed with change in position. The authors concluded that 1) transducer manometry recorded similar resting but higher squeeze pressures compared with perfused manometry; 2) transducer manometry recorded the same radial variation in anal canal resting and squeeze pressures as that recorded by the perfused manometer; and 3) standing and sitting caused a four-fold rise in intrarectal pressure, which was associated with a concomitant rise in resting anal canal pressure.\r"

Compared with continent patients, incontinent patients had lower anal sphincter pressures at rest and during squeeze, a smaller rectal capacity, and leaked earlier and more with the saline infusion test. Differentiation between incontinent and continent patients was not possible with a single test because there was complete overlap. The maximum squeeze pressure showed the best discrimination. Combining the three tests did not show better discrimination than any individual test. Anal pressure and rectal capacity below the normal range only were found in very few incontinent patients. The authors' study demonstrates that no prediction can be made about continence with anorectal function tests. Therefore, in the individual patient, an abnormal result in one test must be interpreted with caution and only in relationship with other tests, especially when therapeutic surgery is considered.\r"

Intramuscular opiate was available on demand during the postoperative period, and the amount and timing of analgesia given was recorded. All patients noted their pain on a daily basis using a linear analogue scale, and all patients answered a questionnaire assessing analgesic efficacy. Although the median time interval between surgery and first analgesic demand was nearly four times greater for patients receiving bupivacaine compared with adrenaline solution, there was no difference in the levels of pain recorded or in the overall opiate requirements. Local injection of bupivacaine after hemorrhoidectomy provides initial pain relief, but patients do not obtain an overall analgesic benefit.\r"

Anal manometry was performed in all patients and electromyography was performed in 24 patients. Thirty patients underwent delayed sphincter repair. In all patients, a dehiscence was found anteriorly, bridged by scar tissue. Continence was restored in 25 patients (83 percent). Electromyography was performed postoperatively in patients who remained incontinent and who demonstrated severe denervation. All these patients had undergone previous sphincter repair. In seven patients, there were no signs of obstetric injury. Electromyography demonstrated severe denervation, but sphincter mapping did not demonstrate muscle discontinuity. Continence improved in four patients within one year as a result of reinnervation demonstrated by electromyography. The authors conclude that fecal incontinence after childbirth may be due to either obstetric rupture or denervation. Both disorders may coexist. Delayed sphincter repair gives excellent results provided that denervation is not present. Preoperative assessment with electromyography is mandatory.\r"

When considering the appearance of transitional mucosa, not only in the neoplastic lesions such as carcinoma or adenoma but also in the begin polyp, the transitional change adjacent to the carcinoma cannot be classified as a precancerous phenomenon; rather, it is a secondary one. The mucin-histochemical study disclosed transitional mucosa in all the 21 carcinomas less than 1 cm in diameter and immunohistochemical staining for CEA showed no remarkable change in the adjacent mucosa. Thus, it seems apparent that a change in mucous secretion precedes that of CEA expression in the mucosa adjacent to the carcinoma.\r"

In both sexes, adults with impaired glucose tolerance or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) had increased mean blood pressure compared with those with normal glucose tolerance. These differences were both statistically (P less than 0.05) and clinically (3-12 mmHg) significant and were independent of age, obesity, and the use of antihypertensive medication. Age-adjusted rates of systolic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension were also higher in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or NIDDM compared with those with normal glucose tolerance. Diastolic blood pressures and rates of diastolic hypertension were minimally higher in adults with impaired glucose tolerance and NIDDM. In both sexes, systolic blood pressure correlated significantly with fasting plasma glucose and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose even after adjustment for age and obesity. Postural hypotension occurred in 7% of all subjects and did not vary significantly according to glucose tolerance.\r"

The mean glycemic response areas of the different meals ranked according to the predicted GI in every individual. The observed mean +/- SD GI values of the meals were significantly different from each other (bread 100 +/- 7, rice 75 +/- 9, spaghetti 54 +/- 9), with no significant difference in response between subjects. It is concluded that individuals share common mean GI values for different foods. Within confidence limits determined by the variability of glycemic responses, the number of repeated tests conducted, and the expected GI difference, the GI can be used to predict the ranking of the mean glycemic responses of mixed meals taken by individuals.\r"

The presence of peripheral occlusive arterial disease was determined by postexercise ankle-brachial index (ABI) values; progression of peripheral occlusive arterial disease was determined by the rate of change in postexercise ABI. Patients who underwent peripheral arterial reconstructive surgery or amputation were also classified as having progression of their peripheral occlusive arterial disease. On this basis, follow-up revealed that peripheral occlusive arterial disease developed and therefore progressed in 1 (1%) of the control group and 22 (9%) of the DM. Peripheral occlusive arterial disease progressed in 31 (28%) of the POAD and 26 (26%) of the DM + POAD. The presence of peripheral occlusive arterial disease predisposes to progression of disease, and peripheral occlusive arterial disease is more likely to develop in diabetic patients who do not have peripheral occlusive arterial disease than in nondiabetic control subjects. However, the presence of diabetes mellitus in patients with peripheral occlusive arterial disease does not seem to increase the risk of progression.\r"

Diabetic subjects reported significantly more depressive symptomatology than their overweight nondiabetic spouses (10.6 +/- 6.4 vs. 7.5 +/- 6.2, P less than 0.04). Diabetic subjects scored higher than their spouses on 15 of 20 BDI items, with significant differences in feelings of being punished, perceived appearance, and interest in sex. Mean BDI score in the diabetic spouses was similar to that observed in the first 123 diabetic subjects to enter the weight-loss program (BDI 11.2 +/- 6.9). Further studies are needed to determine whether diabetic subjects differ from age-, sex-, and weight-matched nondiabetic individuals in clinical depression and depressive symptomatology.\r"

AUC was integrated with five computerized methods: polynomial interpolation of third and fourth degree, trapezoidal rule, Simpson's integration, and cubic interpolatory splines. Although these methods gave significantly different results (P less than 0.001), a strong correlation was found between estimations of AUC with different methods (r greater than 0.99, P less than 0.001). In addition, variation between methods was less than or equal to 2%, whereas the coefficient of variation between subjects was 38%. Total AUC was strongly correlated with basal blood glucose value (r = 0.90, P less than 0.001), whereas incremental and positive AUC were not (r = 0.12 and 0.07, respectively, NS). Incremental and positive AUC were strongly correlated with glycemic rise (r = 0.89 and 0.93, respectively, P less than 0.001), whereas total AUC was only slightly so (r = 0.31, P less than 0.01). Incremental and positive AUC gave slightly but significantly different information on glucose response. These results suggest that variations related to the method used in estimating AUC are not clinically relevant and that a simple method such as trapezoidal rule can be used. Total AUC is a descriptive factor related to basal blood glucose value, whereas incremental and positive AUC more accurately describe glycemic response to foods.\r"

Groups did not differ with respect to age, duration of diabetes, or presence of retinopathy. The mean +/- SD heart-rate variation in deep breathing was lower in group 1 than in group 2 (11.6 +/- 6.5 vs. 17.1 +/- 9.0 beats/min, P less than 0.05). Heart-rate variation was more often abnormally low (less than or equal to 10 beats/min) in group 1 than in group 2 (48 vs. 19%, P less than 0.05). Thus, the presence of coronary artery disease appears to modify cardiac parasympathetic reflexes in patients with diabetes mellitus and must be kept in mind when interpreting test results.\r"

Diabetic subjects, on average, reported significantly lower general well-being than control subjects, particularly in terms of health-related fears and feelings of depression. However, diabetic subjects did not report a pervasive functional deficit relative to control subjects and experienced similar employment rates and problems in the workplace. These results suggest that this group of young adult diabetic subjects has adjusted well to the demands of the workplace despite lower reports of general well-being. The results are discussed in light of relevant sampling issues.\r"

To determine the activity of the polyol pathway, the ratio of erythrocyte sorbitol to blood glucose, which reflects aldose reductase activity, was evaluated in 329 patients with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and in 100 nondiabetic age-matched control subjects. Although erythrocyte sorbitol levels were markedly elevated, sorbitol-glucose ratios were significantly lower in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic subjects. Sorbitol-glucose ratios in diabetic patients decreased progressively as blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels increased. Sorbitol-glucose ratios were also studied during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Ratios were again lower in diabetic patients than those in nondiabetic subjects and significantly decreased 120 min after glucose loading. The ratio in diabetic patients also fell with increasing age of the patients. In diabetic patients with neuropathy, retinopathy, or nephropathy, however, sorbitol-glucose ratios were significantly higher than in those without these complications; ratios increased further as complications became more severe. Our findings suggest that the affinity of aldose reductase for glucose in patients with diabetic complications may be increased and that the polyol pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications.\r"

Study subjects comprised a convenience sample of 18 type I diabetic patients aged 17-30 yr and 8 age-matched healthy control subjects. The fluorescence of collagen was measured in skin biopsy material. Collagen-linked fluorescence (CLF) was increased in diabetic patients (mean 10.5 [range 5.8-15.8] U/mg) compared with control subjects (7.6 [5.6-10.1] U/mg, P less than 0.02). In diabetic patients, CLF was related to age (r = 0.581) and duration of diabetes (r = 0.697) but not concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin (r = 0.082). Partial correlation analysis demonstrated that duration of diabetes is the main factor determining the fluorescence of collagen in these patients. There was a relationship between CLF and presence of diabetic retinopathy after the data were adjusted for patient age and duration of diabetes (P = 0.023). Increased fluorescence of skin collagen can be detected in young type I diabetic patients and is primarily related to duration of diabetes.\r"

Study subjects were stratified into three groups based on 2-h plasma glucose values: group 1 (n = 59) less than 5.6 mM, group 2 (n = 112) 5.6-6.0 mM, and group 3 (n = 116) 6.7-9.2 mM. There were statistically significant but low correlations (r less than 0.20) between 2-h plasma glucose levels and mother's age, body mass index, infant weights, and Apgar scores. There was a significant increasing trend in the proportion of overweight and obese women from groups 1 to 3 (P less than 0.02). There was also a significant trend toward higher birth weights (P = 0.013) and larger proportions of large for gestational age (LGA) babies (P = 0.02) from groups 1 to 3, and women with LGA infants showed higher fasting and 2-h plasma glucose levels than women with non-LGA infants (P = 0.032). However, there was no significant difference in perinatal complications or infant morbidity or mortality between groups. Percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin or glycosylated plasma protein did not differ between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All nurses were given initial instruction in a classroom-type setting or via a self-instructional packet, and initial proficiency was documented by initial testing. All nurses were retested 1-8 mo later. To address whether actual frequency of performing MBG at work affected proficiency, the nurses were categorized based on the frequency of performing MBG groups: greater than 1 test/day (n = 53), greater than 1 test/wk (n = 51), greater than 1 test/mo (n = 52), and less than 1 test/mo (n = 22). No differences in test and retest scores were detected. To address whether the time interval from the original instruction and test to the retest affected proficiency, the nurses were divided into groups who had initial test less than 6 mo (n = 108) and greater than 6 mo (n = 70) before the retest. Mean change in test scores was less in the greater than 6-mo group than in the less than 6-mo group (P less than 0.01), and they had a lower retest fail rate (3 vs. 12%, P = 0.03). To explain this unexpected finding, test scores were analyzed by groups based on the type of original instruction. Nurses who attended class (n = 79) were compared with those who had self-instruction (n = 99). The classroom-trained group had less change in test-to-retest score (P = 0.0002) and a lower retest failure rate (3 vs. 12%, P less than 0.05).\r"

After standard in-hospital diabetes education, 36 children (mean age 9.3 yr, range 3-16 yr) were randomized to conventional follow-up, conventional and supportive counseling (SC), or conventional and SMT, which emphasized use of data obtained from self-monitoring of blood glucose. SC and SMT interventions consisted of seven outpatient sessions with a medical social worker during the first 4 mo after diagnosis and booster sessions at 6 and 12 mo postdiagnosis. Groups were similar with respect to age, sex, body mass index, socioeconomic status, C-peptide, and severity of illness at diagnosis. Metabolic control, measured quarterly by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1), improved substantially in all three treatment groups during the first 6 mo. SMT patients had significantly lower HbA1 levels than conventional patients at 1 yr (P less than 0.01) and 2 yr (P less than 0.05) postdiagnosis. SMT patients also had lower HbA1 levels than SC patients, but this did not reach statistical significance. The lower HbA1 levels of SMT patients were not explained by severity of illness at diagnosis, or insulin dose, body mass index, and C-peptide levels at 2 yr. These results suggest that an SMT program during the first few months after diagnosis helps avoid the deterioration in metabolic control often seen in children with IDDM between 6 and 24 mo after diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) among children aged 0-17 yr for age, sex, season, and urban and rural residence of onset in Colorado. Retrospective registration of new-onset cases was conducted from 1978 to 1980, and then prospective registration continued through 1983 with the use of physician reporting with hospital validation. The annual incidence of IDDM was 15.2/100,000 per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.1, 16.3), with little difference between the sexes. The highest incidence was in the 10- to 14-yr age-group for both sexes. There was a seasonal peak of winter onset in those aged 10-17 yr, with similar patterns between sex and ethnic groups. No temporal trend over the 6 yr was seen, although an excess of cases was seen for 15- to 17-yr-old boys in 1980-1982. Rates were similar for urban and rural areas of the state. Case ascertainment was estimated to be 93.2% complete (95% CI 91.5, 95.5). Incidence was similar in Colorado to other populations in the United States at similar latitudes. These data serve as a baseline for evaluation of changes in incidence over time, by region, and for the identification of possible outbreaks.\r"

  ".W": "We defined the causal pathways responsible for 80 consecutive initial lower-extremity amputations to an extremity in diabetic patients at the Seattle Veterans Affairs Medical Center over a 30-mo interval from 1984 to 1987. Causal pathways, either unitary or composed of various combinations of seven potential causes (i.e., ischemia, infection, neuropathy, faulty wound healing, minor trauma, cutaneous ulceration, gangrene), were determined empirically after a synthesis by the investigators of various objective and subjective data. Estimates of the proportion of amputations that could be ascribed to each component cause were calculated. Twenty-three unique causal pathways to diabetic limb amputation were identified. Eight frequent constellations of component causes resulted in 73% of the amputations. Most pathways were composed of multiple causes, with only critical ischemia from acute arterial occlusions responsible for amputations as a singular cause. The causal sequence of minor trauma, cutaneous ulceration, and wound-healing failure applied to 72% of the amputations, often with the additional association of infection and gangrene. We specified precise criteria in the definition of causal pathway to permit estimation of the cumulative proportion of amputations due to various causes. Forty-six percent of the amputations were attributed to ischemia, 59% to infection, 61% to neuropathy, 81% to faulty wound healing, 84% to ulceration, 55% to gangrene, and 81% to initial minor trauma. An identifiable and potentially preventable pivotal event, in most cases an episode involving minor trauma that caused cutaneous injury, preceded 69 to 80 amputations. Defining causal pathways that predispose to diabetic limb amputation suggests practical interventions that may be effective in preventing diabetic limb loss.\r"

  ".W": "A film test for the rapid detection of plasma/serum 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) has been developed. The film contains NAD, nitro blue tetrazolium, 3-OHB dehydrogenase, and diaphorase, and the surface is coated with modified biomembrane and can detect 50-1500 microM 3-OHB within 2-3 min. One drop or 50 microliters of plasma/serum or blood is applied to the film, and the violet color is read via reflectance meter after 2 min. Plasma/serum samples greater than 1500 microM 3-OHB can be measured by dilution with saline. In blood with 40% hematocrit, the color developed is 50% less than with plasma/serum, and this was adjusted in the reflectance meter. A good correlation (r = 0.99) was observed between results with automated and film methods and between visual methods and reflectance meter. In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, all 3 subjects with positive ketonuria (+ +), 8 of 12 subjects with mild ketonuria (+), and 7 of 25 subjects without ketonuria exhibited elevation of 3-OHB in blood greater than 200 microM. The results indicate that 3-OHB film is valuable not only in the emergency room for the differential diagnosis between ketoacidotic and nonketotic hypersomolar coma but also as a marker for insulin dependency, energy dependency on fatty acid compared with glucose, and metabolic control of diabetes.\r"

It is a follow-up study of a consecutive sample of women with GDM in a tertiary care center in Trinidad, West Indies. The cohort was a consecutive sample of 157 women with GDM who delivered in the hospital between June 1981 and December 1984. Of these, a volunteer sample of 60 women (38%) consented to participate 3.5-6.5 yr later. The two groups were remarkably similar in ethnic composition, mean age at index delivery, marital status, and family history of DM. Interviews revealed that 26 women (43%) had already developed DM for which they were receiving treatment. The remaining 34 women (57%) were given a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting and half-hourly venous blood samples were obtained and analyzed for plasma glucose. Based on accepted diagnostic criteria, 11 (32%) of 34 had DM, 10 (29%) had IGT, and 13 (38%) had normal glucose tolerance. A total of 37 (62%) of 60 women had developed DM, and another 10 (17%) had IGT in the intervening 3.5-6.5 yr. The results support findings that GDM is associated with an increased risk of mothers developing DM in later life.\r"

They were compared to 72 control subjects of the same geographic region and nationality. To evaluate the individual skin pigmentation type, a standardized questionnaire was developed. Reactivity to UV light was determined by a stepwise-graded UV irradiation. Significantly more diabetic patients in southern Germany had blue eyes than nondiabetic control subjects (55 vs. 26%, P less than 0.01), and significantly more diabetic patients had a low-pigment eye color (blue or green) than control subjects (66 vs. 38%, P less than 0.01). In addition, more fair skin color was noted among diabetic versus control subjects (84 vs. 60%, P less than 0.01). In response to UV irradiation, diabetic patients more often showed an increased UV-light sensitivity than control subjects (83 vs. 23%, P less than 0.001). The relative risk for susceptibility to type I diabetes in subjects with low-pigment eye color was 3.1, in subjects with fair skin type 3.4, and in subjects with increased UV-light sensitivity 5.8. The highest risk for the development of diabetes was seen in subjects who had low-pigment eye color and/or increased UV-light sensitivity (95 vs. 51%, P = 0.00002, odds ratio 17.4). We conclude that a low-pigment skin type may predispose for the development of type I diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the prevalence of previously unrecognized hemochromatosis among patients in whom diabetes mellitus was diagnosed after the age of 30 yr, and we evaluated the positive predictive value of biochemical screening tests for hemochromatosis in diabetic subjects. Thirty-eight of 572 patients screened (6.6%) had a serum ferritin level greater than 324 micrograms/L; 16 patients had normal levels on repeat testing. Four patients' serum ferritin levels fell to less than 400 micrograms/L. Seven of 18 patients with a persistently elevated serum ferritin level did not undergo a liver biopsy because of a recognized cause of hyperferritenemia (carcinoma, alcoholism, or systemic lupus erythematosus). The diagnosis of hemochromatosis seemed certain in 1 of 3 patients who were not biopsied for technical reasons. Of 8 patients biopsied, 2 had hemochromatosis, 4 had fatty liver, 1 had hemosiderosis, and 1 had a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with no iron deposition. Of 4 patients with a raised transferrin saturation level, 2 had raised serum ferritin levels and hemochromatosis, 1 had raised serum ferritin and hemosiderosis on liver biopsy, and 1 had a normal transferrin saturation level on repeat testing. Two of 3 cases of hemochromatosis had other clinical markers of the condition. Therefore, routine screening of diabetic patients for hemochromatosis is not necessary, because patients with hemochromatosis will often have other clinical features of the disease. When screening diabetic patients for hemochromatosis, it should be remembered that a persistently raised serum ferritin level has a low positive predictive value (16.6%) and that a normal transferrin saturation level does not exclude the diagnosis.\r"

The polyclonal antibody, UB286, which was obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, recognizes determinants surrounding residues 15 and 16 in the B-region and residues 49-51, 55 and 56 in the A-region. These residues are predicted to be within helical segments which are accessible for surface binding. The monoclonal antibody SM 1.2 selectively recognizes the region surrounding residues 15 and 16. Antibodies UB286 and SM 1.2 are both neutralizing antibodies as judged by their ability to inhibit binding of 125I-IGF I to type 1 receptors on human placental membranes. In addition, SM 1.2 inhibits the ability of IGF I and IGF analogs for which it has high affinity to stimulate DNA synthesis in murine fibroblasts. In contrast, analogs with substitutions at residues 15 and 16, which have poor affinity for SM 1.2, stimulate DNA synthesis with equal potency in the presence and absence of SM 1.2. These antibodies bind normally to analogs which we have previously shown have drastically reduced binding to type 1 IGF receptors, indicating that the antibodies and the receptors recognize distinct domains of IGF I.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) was investigated in MA-10 tumor Leydig cells. We recently demonstrated that the constitutive and cAMP-stimulated expression of P450scc in normal mouse Leydig cells is negatively regulated by glucocorticoids. We now report that glucocorticoids have the opposite effect in MA-10 cells causing a 1.7-fold increase in the rate of P450scc synthesis and a 2.1-fold increase in the amount of P450scc mRNA. Treatment of MA-10 cells with 10 microM 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) (cAMP) resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in P450scc synthesis and a 3-fold increase in P450scc mRNA. Combined treatment with dexamethasone and cAMP resulted in additive increases in synthesis (2.8-fold) and mRNA (5.3-fold). Increases in de novo synthesis and mRNA levels were reflected by modest increases in the amount of immunoreactive P450scc enzyme protein. Dexamethasone-mediated stimulation in synthesis and accumulation of P450scc mRNA were blocked by the antiglucocorticoid RU-486. Cycloheximide blocked both cAMP- and dexamethasone-induced increases but had no effect on constitutive levels of P450scc mRNA. Treatment of MA-10 cells with 10 microM 8-Br-cAMP had no effect on cell morphology and stimulated progesterone accumulation to a minor degree. Treatment of MA-10 cells with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP resulted in cell rounding and loss of cells from culture dishes. The results of this study demonstrate that: 1) dexamethasone increases P450scc de novo synthesis and mRNA levels in MA-10 tumor Leydig cells, opposite to the effect in normal Leydig cells; 2) dexamethasone- and cAMP-stimulated increases occur via distinct mechanisms; 3) and synthesis of protein factor(s) is required to mediate the action of both dexamethasone and cAMP.\r"

Using immunological techniques, we have localized mPL-I both in utero and in vitro to trophoblast giant cells. Detectable amounts of mPL-I were first seen by immunohistochemistry on day 6 of gestation in the mural trophoblast. On day 7 giant cells of the ectoplacental cone also contained mPL-I, and on day 10 giant cells adjacent to both the decidua basalis and decidua capsularis stained positive. By day 12 however, all intra- and extraembryonic tissues were negative. The pattern of mPL-I staining in the placenta is consistent with its reported gestational serum profile. mPL-I was also present in trophoblast giant cells in vitro shortly after attachment and spreading of day 5 blastocysts. Analysis of conditioned medium from blastocyst outgrowths by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional electrophoresis, and by immunoblotting, identified mPL-I as the major secretory product from the trophoblast, consisting of a group of acidic proteins of 30,000-45,000 Mr. The synthesis and secretion of mPL-I in vitro occurred in a serum-free medium suggesting that production of this hormone is part of an endogenous program of trophoblast differentiation.\r"

In a batch incubation system using isolated hepatocytes, PGE2 increased glucose output dose-dependently. The glycogenolytic effect of PGE2 was detected at a concentration of 10(-11) M, and 10(-8) M PGE2 elicited the maximum glucose output, which was equal to that by glucagon. PGE2 did not increase cAMP at any dose tested (10(-11)-10(-4) M). Instead, PGE2 increased the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c). When the effect of PGE2 on [Ca2+]c was studied in aequorin-loaded cells, the effect of PGE2 on [Ca2+]c was detected at 10(-12) M, and the magnitude of the response increased in a dose-dependent manner. PGE2 increased [Ca2+]c even in the presence of 1 microM extracellular calcium, suggesting that PGE2 mobilizes calcium from an intracellular pool. In line with these observations, PGE2 increased the production of inositol trisphosphate. Compared with the action of PGE2, 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2, a PGE2 analog, was less potent in stimulating glycogenolysis. These results indicate that PGE2 stimulates glycogenolysis by activating the calcium messenger system.\r"

A reduction of splenic natural killer (NK) activity has also been described after the central administration of CRF. In this study we examined whether the central release of CRF plays a physiological role in mediating stress-induced suppression of NK cytotoxicity. Four sessions of footshock stress (1.5 mamp; 1-sec duration; 60-Hz sine wave; delivered randomly twice per min for 30 min) over a 48-h period significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced splenic NK activity in the rat. Pretreatment of the animals by central administration of polyclonal CRF antibodies completely antagonized the stress-induced suppression of NK cell activity. In contrast, the peripheral immunoneutralization of CRF was ineffective. Measurement of circulating levels of ACTH and corticosterone demonstrated that stress-induced elevations of ACTH and corticosterone were significantly (P less than 0.05) attenuated by peripheral anti-CRF serum, but not by centrally administered anti-CRF. These findings suggest that endogenous brain CRF coordinates the suppressive effect of footshock stress on NK cytotoxicity independently of pituitary-adrenal activation.\r"

The analog (CTR) and salmon calcitonin (sCT) stimulated kidney cell adenylate cyclase activity and inhibited bone resorption in organ cultures of fetal rat long bones with similar potencies and efficacies. Furthermore, CTR and sCT, at similar doses, induced comparable hypocalcemic responses in mice following sc injection or infusions. However, unlike sCT, CTR did not induce anorexia and weight loss in rats following sc injection. These data suggest that the ring structure of sCT may be important for the anorexigenic effect but is not required for effect on bone resorption or calcium homeostasis. Clinical studies appear warranted as, potentially, CTR might induce fewer side effects than does sCT.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin was measured by RIA in testicular extracts and plasma of cynomolgus monkeys during four stages of sexual maturation. Immunoactive inhibin levels were compared to those of another Sertoli cell secreted protein, androgen-binding protein (ABP). ABP steroid-binding (bioactive) activity was measured in testes and epididymal segments using the radiolabeled ligand [3H]dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Testicular immunoreactive inhibin concentrations were maximal in late prepubertal monkeys, 2.5-3.5 yr old, while the total testicular content of inhibin progressively increased with age into adulthood. Bioactive testicular ABP concentrations were maximal during the pubertal period of the cynomolgus monkey (3.5-4.0 yr old), while the total ABP content of the testes also increased with sexual maturation. Mean (+/- SE) plasma concentrations of inhibin and testosterone (T) in adults, 6-8 yr old (17.72 +/- 3.5 microliters inhibin equivalents/ml and 7.07 +/- 2.45 ng/ml T, respectively), were significantly higher (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001, respectively) than those in early prepubertal, juvenile monkeys, aged 1.5-2.5 yr (5.85 +/- 2.1 microliters inhibin equivalents/ml and 0.27 +/- 0.02 ng/ml T). The increased plasma levels of inhibin and T in adults were associated, respectively, with the increased inhibin and androgen contents of the testes in these same animals. The developmental changes in testicular steady state mRNA concentrations for the inhibin alpha-, beta A-, and beta B-subunits as well as ABP were examined during sexual maturation by Northern blot analysis using heterologous human cDNA probes. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms revealed that the inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA concentrations were higher than those of inhibin-beta A and -beta B and ABP mRNA during all stages of pubertal development. Although the relative concentrations of each inhibin subunit mRNA were decreased in the adult animals relative to those in the juvenile monkeys, the total amount of steady state mRNA for the subunits was greater than that in the immature animals. A similar situation existed for the ABP mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The C-24 oxidation pathway plays a major role in the degradation of vitamin D metabolites in kidney and other target tissues. The aim of the present study was to establish an intestinal cell culture system to study the mechanisms regulating the vitamin D catabolic pathway. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase), the first enzyme in the catabolic sequence, was examined in Caco-2 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line which exhibits differentiated functions of absorbing intestinal epithelial cells. While untreated Caco-2 cells did not exhibit 24-hydroxylase activity, significant catabolic activity was induced by prior treatment of cell monolayers with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3). Induced 24-hydroxylase D3 (25OHD3) and 1,25-(OH)2D3 was detected 6 h after treatment of cells with 10(-8)M 1,25-(OH)2D3, peaked at 16 h, and decreased thereafter. Treatment of cells with 10(-7) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 elicited a maximal 24-hydroxylase response. Comparable time courses of induction by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3-dose response curves were observed in cultured human skin fibroblasts and Caco-2 cells. 25OHD3 was not as good an inducer of the vitamin D catabolic pathway in Caco-2 cells as 1,25-(OH)2D3. Induction of 24-hydroxylase activity by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was inhibited by pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with either actinomycin D, alpha-amanitin, or cycloheximide suggesting that mRNA and protein synthesis are required for induction. The present study demonstrates that 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated Caco-2 cells express the vitamin D catabolic pathway and, therefore, constitute a useful in vitro model to study the mechanism of induction by 1,25-(OH)2D3.\r"

  ".U": "90276320\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), a macrophage-derived pleiotropic cytokine produced during the inflammatory/immune response, on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of the rat. Intravenous injections of TNF alpha stimulated plasma ACTH and corticosterone secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was inhibited by a rat CRH antiserum that was administered to the rats 1 h before the TNF alpha injections. This suggested that CRH is a major mediator of the HPA axis response to TNF alpha. We subsequently evaluated the ability of TNF alpha to influence CRH and ACTH secretion in vitro by explanted rat hypothalami in organ culture and by dispersed rat anterior pituicytes in primary culture respectively. Hypothalami were incubated for 40 min with graded concentrations of TNF alpha (10 pM to 1 microM). This cytokine stimulated CRH secretion in a dose-dependent fashion, with an EC50 of 6.7 x 10 pM (P less than 0.05). Preincubation of hypothalamic explants with dexamethasone, indomethacin (1 microM), eicosatetraynoic acid (10 microM), or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (30 microM) resulted in inhibition of TNF alpha-stimulated CRH secretion (P less than 0.05). Interestingly, 4-h incubation with TNF alpha had no effect on ACTH secretion from rat anterior pituicytes at a concentration of 10 nM. Higher concentrations of TNF alpha (100 nM and 1 microM), however, elicited a dose-dependent increase in the ACTH concentration in the medium. Our results suggest that TNF alpha represents one of the immune response mediators that directly or via stimulation of other cytokines act as activators of the HPA axis during immune/inflammatory reactions. This effect appears to be glucocorticoid suppressible and eicosanoid mediated. The primary site of action of TNF alpha appears to by the hypothalamic CRH-secreting neuron. Some pituitary and adrenal effects of TNF alpha, however, cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "Naturally occurring and synthetic plant flavonoids, such as EMD 21388, are potent inhibitors of thyroid hormone 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) in vitro, but not when given in vivo, since they are tightly bound by serum transthyretin (TTR). EMD 21388 also inhibits the binding of T4 to human, dog, and rat serum TTR in vitro and when administered to rats in vivo. In the present studies the administration of EMD 21388 inhibited the binding of T4 to TTR within 3 min, resulting in a decrease in the serum T4 concentration, an increase in the percentage of serum free T4 assessed by equilibrium dialysis, and an increase in the serum total free T4 concentration. Depending upon the dose of EMD 21388 employed, the serum total free T4 concentration was either elevated for at least 60 min or transiently elevated, returning to normal values by 60 min. Although the total serum T3 concentration was decreased and the percent free T3 increased, these changes were modest, and the serum free T3 concentrations remained normal after EMD 21388 administration. The transient elevations of serum free T4 concentrations 10 and 20 min after the administration of 0.3 mumol EMD 21388/100 g BW resulted in a significant decrease in the serum TSH concentration at 60 min. These observations strongly suggest that the serum free T4 concentration and not T4 bound to serum TTR is biologically available to the pituitary to regulate TSH secretion and/or synthesis. The administration of EMD 21388, which rapidly increases the serum free T4, but not the serum free T3, concentration, will now permit studies of the effect(s) of endogenously elevated serum free T4 concentrations, rather than those after the administration of pharmacological quantities of T3 and T4, on various aspects of the biosynthesis and release of pituitary TSH.\r"

Using a serum-restricted, monolayer culture system containing very low levels of platelet-poor plasma-derived serum (PPPDS), the facilitative roles of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) with respect to growth factor-stimulated granulosa cell proliferation were investigated. In nutrient medium containing only 0.1% PPPDS, PDGF (1-25 ng/ml) had no effect upon granulosa cell proliferation. When combined with EGF, which alone does not stimulate granulosa cell proliferation, PDGF dose-dependently increased cell proliferation to levels obtained with 10% fetal calf serum (2.4-fold increase relative to controls, P less than 0.05). When combined with EGF and IGF-I, a combination which does stimulate mitosis in granulosa cells, PDGF again dose-dependently enhanced proliferation (P less than 0.05). The extent of proliferation obtained with EGF + IGF-I + PDGF was consistently greater than that obtained with 10% fetal calf serum (P less than 0.05) but significantly less than that obtained with EGF + fetal calf serum, a treatment which stimulates rapid granulosa cell proliferation. LDL has been shown to greatly enhance granulosa cell steroidogenesis by providing exogenous cholesterol. However, cholesterol is also required for plasma membrane biosynthesis and cell growth. LDL alone, had no effect upon porcine granulosa cell proliferation relative to media controls (0.1% PPPDS) nor did it synergize with any single growth factor to induce mitosis. When combined with EGF + IGF-I, and EGF + PDGF, but not PDGF + IGF-I, LDL dose-dependently (1-25 micrograms/ml) enhanced proliferation (P less than 0.05) to levels equivalent to that obtained with 10% fetal calf serum. When combined with EGF, IGF-I, and PDGF, LDL at 10 micrograms/ml enhanced proliferation to an extent equivalent with EGF + fetal calf serum (a 5.4-fold increase relative to media controls). High density lipoprotein did not itself stimulate proliferation nor did it facilitate proliferation mediated by growth factors. When maintained in medium alone (0.1% PPPDS), the cell population doubling time was 8.0 +/- 0.5 days. In the presence of EGF, IGF-I, PDGF, and LDL (10, 10, and 5 ng/ml, and 10 micrograms/ml, respectively) the doubling time was reduced to 2.0 +/- 0.1 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To obtain precise information about the cellular and subcellular localization of 3 beta HSD in the gonads and adrenals of the guinea pig, we have proceeded to immunocytochemical localization of the enzyme using antibodies developed against purified human placental 3 beta HSD. In the testis, specific immunostaining was restricted to the cytoplasm of the interstitial cells. In the ovary, on the other hand, immunostaining was found in the cytoplasm of the cells of the corpus luteum and theca interna. The granulosa cells of the follicles were not immunolabeled, with the exception of one layer of cells in contact with the zona pellucida. This restricted labeling was observed in growing and mature follicles, but not in primordial and small primary follicles. In the adrenals, the three zones of the cortex were labeled, whereas no staining could be detected in the medulla. Contrary to findings in the testis and ovary, staining was found in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of adrenocortical cells. The present data suggest a functional interaction between the ovocyte and the specialized layer of 3 beta HSD-containing granulosa cells which might play a role in ovocyte maturation.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism for control of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and cytochrome P-450 side chain cleavage (P-450scc), enzymes involved in the synthesis and processing of cholesterol in the corpus luteum of pregnant rats. The role of sterol and estradiol were investigated by administering 4-aminopyrazolo-[3,4d]pyrimidine (4-APP), aminoglutethimide and/or estradiol to day 12 hypophysectomized-hysterectomized pregnant rats. Estradiol treatment markedly increased mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase in the corpus luteum. This stimulatory effect of estradiol was specific for the reductase since the mRNA for luteal P-450scc did not increase following estradiol treatment. To determine whether estradiol's action on HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was mediated by changes in cellular free cholesterol, the separate and combined action of estradiol and either 4-APP or aminoglutethimide on both sterol content and HMG-CoA reductase expression was examined. The estradiol induced rise in HMG-CoA reductase was not accompanied by a decrease in luteal cholesterol. 4-APP treatment depleted cholesterol in the corpus luteum and induced a greater increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA than estradiol. Combined treatment with estradiol and 4-APP resulted in a synergistic increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA despite the fact that estradiol did not further reduce the 4-APP induced decrease in luteal sterol content. This indicates that luteal cells possess an estradiol-mediated mechanism for up-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene expression which is distinct from the cholesterol negative feedback regulation. However, estradiol stimulation of HMG-CoA reductase was totally inhibited when sterol content was elevated by aminoglutethimide, suggesting that estradiol stimulation of HMG-CoA reductase expression is not sufficient to overcome the negative regulatory effect of cholesterol. In contrast to HMG-CoA reductase mRNA which appears to be controlled by sterol and estradiol, P-450scc mRNA levels remained constant in corpora lutea despite wide changes in sterol and steroid content induced by either 4-APP, aminoglutethimide or estradiol treatment. However, interestingly, aminoglutethimide increased substantially the content of P-450scc protein. This increase in P-450scc enzyme was not due to a greater amount of translatable message since similar levels of immunoprecipitable 35S-P-450scc were translated in vitro from luteal mRNA of rats treated with or without aminoglutethimide. In summary, results of this investigation have revealed that the expression of HMG-CoA reductase and cytochrome P-450scc are controlled by totally different mechanisms in the rat corpus luteum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested parallels between the mechanisms underlying sexual differentiation and age-related loss of reproductive cyclicity in the female rat. Both appear to involve the actions of estrogen on the brain and are associated with a reduction in hypothalamic estrogen sensitivity. In this study the effects of sex and aging on cell nuclear estrogen receptor-binding capacity and cytosol progestin receptor induction in the pituitary gland, periventricular preoptic area (PVP), medial preoptic area (mPO), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, arcuate median eminence region (ARC), ventromedial nucleus (VMN), and corticomedial amygdala were directly compared. Young (2.5 months old) and middle-aged (8-10 months old) male and female and old (19 months old) female rats were gonadectomized 14 days before adrenalectomy (ADX). For comparison of cell nuclear estrogen receptor-binding capacity, animals received a saturating dose of estradiol (36.0 micrograms/kg BW) 3 days after ADX and 1 h before death. Cell nuclear estrogen binding was measured by an in vitro exchange assay. For comparison of estrogen-induced progestin receptors, animals received a sc placed Silastic capsule containing 10% 17 beta-estradiol at the time of ADX and were killed 3 days later. Cytosol progestin binding was measured by an in vitro binding assay. Cell nuclear estrogen-binding capacities and cytosol progestin receptor induction were lower in the PVP, mPO, and VMN of the young male than in the young female. In the female, the level of progestin receptor induction in the pituitary and brain was unaffected by age; however, cell nuclear estrogen-binding capacity in the mPO, VMN, ARC, and pituitary gland was lower in old than in middle-aged females. These results demonstrate that the effects of sexual differentiation and aging on the hypothalamus involve similar, but not identical, region-specific reductions in cell nuclear estrogen receptor-binding capacity. The consequences of these reduced estrogen receptor binding levels in terms of the induction of progestin receptor in response to estrogen exposure are, however, very different in the male compared to those in old female rats.\r"

  ".U": "90276332\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism that underlies activation of lipolysis by GH is not yet understood. Although cAMP is thought to be involved, the biochemical linkages between GH and cAMP are unknown, and lipolysis produced by GH differs from that produced by such typical activators of adenylate cyclase as the catecholamines with regard to time course, maximum response, and dependence on other factors such as glucocorticoids or theophylline. The present studies were undertaken to evaluate the possibility that activation of protein kinase C by GH may play an important role in the production of the delayed increase in lipolysis. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a known activator of protein kinase C, increased lipolysis in segments of adipose tissue of hypophysectomized rats, and, as with GH, this effect was potentiated by theophylline. The lipolytic effects of PMA were concentration-dependent, required a shorter lag period than those of human GH, increased as the concentration of PMA was raised from 0.1 to 10 microM, and were additive at all concentrations with lipolysis produced by saturating concentrations of GH. The lipolytic actions of GH, but not PMA, were potentiated by dexamethasone in adipose tissue of normal rats. Sphingosine and staurosporine, which are known to inhibit protein kinase C, blocked the lipolytic effects of PMA and severely reduced lipolysis in response to GH in tissues of both normal and hypophysectomized rats. Although higher concentrations of sphingosine interfered with the specific binding of 125I-labeled human GH to isolated adipocytes, the inhibitory effects of sphingosine cannot be attributed to interference with GH binding, since it decreased lipolysis by at least 50% when used at concentrations that were too low to reduce binding significantly. Staurosporine produced little (approximately 20%) or no decrease in binding. At concentrations that severely reduced lipolysis in response to GH and dexamethasone, sphingosine had little or no effect on lipolysis in response to dibutyryl cAMP or forskolin. Staurosporine and sphingosine, however, severely inhibited lipolysis in response to isoproterenol. We conclude that protein kinase C activity plays an important role in hormone-stimulated lipolysis probably by an action exerted on the transduction pathway proximal to cAMP. The present data are equally consistent with the possibilities that GH and/or isoproterenol activate protein kinase C, or that protein kinase C is constitutively active to some extent. It is likely that protein kinase C activity is permissive for, rather than a mediator of, the lipolytic actions of GH and isoproterenol.\r"

  ".W": "Nucleotide sequence analysis of the complimentary DNAs (cDNA) and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis have shown that clusterin is equivalent to sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2), testosterone-repressed prostate protein-2 (TRPP-2), and androgen-repressed protein (ARP) in the rat, as well as serum/seminal plasma protein, SP-40,40, in the human. In view of its widespread presence in various species, a specific RIA was established to quantify the tissue distribution of this protein. Rat clusterin is present in almost all organ tissues examined, including testis, epididymis, serum, liver, prostate, seminal vesicles, and uterus. Displacement curves generated using cytosols prepared from these organs were parallel to those obtained using purified rat clusterin and crude Sertoli cell-enriched culture medium. Immunoreactive clusterin was also visualized in these organ extracts by immunoblots. Studies on the tissue distribution of immunoreactive clusterin using RIA revealed that the concentration of clusterin in the epididymis of adult rats was 6- and 10-fold higher than that in the serum and testis, respectively and is 50- to 100-fold higher in the liver, spleen, kidney, brain, ventral prostate, seminal vesicles, and uterus. A study of the distribution of clusterin in various compartments of the epididymis indicated its concentration in the caput epididymis was almost 3-fold higher than that in the corpus and cauda epididymis. After orchiectomy, the concentrations of clusterin in the ventral prostate and seminal vesicles increased as much as 100- and 10-fold and peaked at day 4 after surgery, respectively; daily injection of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) beginning at day 3 after orchiectomy reduced the concentrations of clusterin and restored them to a normal level. A different pattern was noted in the epididymis after orchiectomy; the concentration of clusterin in the caput epididymis decreased with time; however, daily injection of DHT beginning at day 3 increased the caput epididymal clusterin concentration and restored it to a normal level. The concentration of clusterin was not altered in the corpus or cauda epididymis after castration and/or DHT administration. Also, the serum and liver clusterin levels did not change with time after orchiectomy. These observations suggest that clusterin will be a valuable marker to monitor the diverse effects of androgen withdrawal in the male reproductive tract. We conclude that clusterin may be a multifunctional protein in view of its broad tissue distribution and association with numerous physiological and pathological conditions.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that a pleomorphic cell line of abnormal human karyotype derived from a stomach carcinoma (LIM-1839) proliferates in serum-free medium, expresses insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA, and secretes IGF-II (up to 56 ng/ml in serum-free conditioned medium, as measured in a rat liver RRA. No detectable levels of IGF-I can be measured in serum-free conditioned medium by RIA. These cells also secrete IGF-binding proteins, detected by a charcoal adsorption assay. The release of IGF-II and IGF binding proteins into serum-free conditioned medium (1.7 pmol/10(6) cells.24 h and 0.8 pmol binding sites/10(6) cells.24 h for 3 days, respectively) is inhibited 80% by cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml). The LIM-1839 cells have type I and type II IGF receptors, determined by affinity cross-linking and competition binding studies. These cells proliferated 1.6-fold over 4 days in serum-free medium, with fresh medium changes on days 0 and 2: their growth was inhibited 56% by 40 micrograms/ml Sm 1.2, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes IGF-I and IGF-II. The addition of 20 and 50 ng/ml multiplication stimulating activity (rat IGF-II) caused 1.8- and 1.7-fold increases in cell growth between days 0 and 4 compared to controls, while [Thr59]IGF-I, at 20 and 50 ng/ml, caused 1.6- and 2.0-fold increases. Insulin, at 2 and 10 micrograms/ml, had no significant effect. The stimulatory effects of endogenous and exogenous IGFs on LIM-1839 cell proliferation were inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the type I IGF receptor, alpha IR-3. These results suggest that the LIM-1839 cells are biologically responsive to endogenously produced IGF-II, and may thereby provide an in vitro model for autocrine regulation of human tumor growth by IGF-II.\r"

  ".W": "We describe the isolation of a steroidogenesis-inducing protein (SIP) from human ovarian follicular fluid and its effects on in vitro steroid synthesis of testicular, ovarian, and adrenal cells. After heating at 60 C, precipitation with 80% ammonium sulfate and dialysis, the human ovarian follicular fluid proteins were fractionated by gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-200. The bioactivity was eluted in the mol wt region between 40 and 60 K. SIP was further purified by affinity chromatography on blue Sepharose (CL-6B), preparative isoelectrofocusing on sucrose density gradients, anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q by using fast protein liquid chromatography system and gel chromatography on Superose 12. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified SIP under both reducing and nonreducing conditions revealed a single band with an approximate mol wt of 60 K. SIP exhibited a pI value of 4.8, was heat sensitive, and lost activity upon lyophilization. SIP copurified with albumin in various isolation procedures and was distinct from human serum albumin but may represent a modified form of human albumin. SIP stimulated testosterone production by testicular pieces, interstitial cells, or purified Leydig cells from rats under different in vitro conditions. The SIP also stimulated basal and human CG stimulated in vitro progesterone production of human ovarian granulosa-lutein cells and corticosterone production of rat adrenal cells. The effects of SIP on testicular, ovarian, and adrenal cells were evident in the presence of maximal concentrations of tropic hormones. The steroid-free spent media from human granulosa-lutein cell cultures also stimulated testosterone production by rat interstitial cells, suggesting that granulosa cells may be the cellular source of SIP. In conclusion, human ovarian cells secrete a hitherto unknown albumin-like protein which enhances both basal and tropic hormone stimulated steroidogenesis in gonadal and adrenal cells. This protein may play a significant role in ovarian function by modifying steroidogenesis in the preovulatory follicle.\r"

  ".U": "90276343\r", 
  ".W": "FRTL5 cells, a thyroid follicular cell line derived from normal rat thyroid, has been extensively used as a model system to study various aspects of the physiology of the thyroid epithelium. The capacity of these cells to metabolize iodothyronines and to generate T3 from T4 has not been previously examined. Here we studied the deiodination of T4, T3, and rT3 in homogenates of FRTL5 cells. By far, these homogenates were more potent catalyzing the 5'-deiodination (outer ring) of T4 and rT3 than the inner ring deiodination of T4 or T3. Both the production of rT3 and the degradation of newly formed T3 from T4 were very limited. Thus, when T4 was used as a substrate, T3 and iodide accumulated in a linear fashion with time, and initially the amounts of iodide and T3 were approximately equal. rT3 and 3,3'-diiodothyronine were rapidly deiodinated by these homogenates, with the 3'-deiodination of 3,3'-diiodothyronine occurring at a slower rate than the 5'-deiodination of rT3. The iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase activity corresponded to type I, as indicated by the following: the Km for T4 and T3 was in the micromolar range; rT3 was a better substrate than T4 (maximum velocity = 101 vs. 19 pmol/min.mg protein; Km = 0.83 vs. 3.1 microM, respectively); and the kinetics of inhibition by 6n-propyl-2-thiouracil were uncompetitive and substrate dependent, suggesting ping-pong kinetics. The type I 5'-deiodinase activity of FRTL5 cells was distinctly stimulated by TSH. This stimulation seems to be mediated by cAMP and requires serum as a permissive factor. In conclusion, 1) FRTL5 cells exhibit both inner and outer ring iodothyronine-deiodinating activities; 2) iodothyronine 5'-deiodination is by far more active; 3) the 5'-deiodination has been characterized as type I deiodinase based on substrate preference, enzyme kinetics, and inhibitors; 4) in all respect iodothyronine deiodination by FRTL5 cell homogenates proceeded with marked similarity to that in homogenates or microsomes of thyroid glands from several species; and 5) the FRTL5 type I deiodinase is more active than that reported in thyroid tissue and as active as that reported in liver and kidney, the prototype of type I deiodinase-containing tissues. The present studies indicate that FRTL5 cells are an excellent model system to study cellular and biochemical aspects of the regulation of this enzyme as well as its regulation by TSH and putative serum factors.\r"

  ".W": "Demineralized bone matrix contains a number of growth factors for osteoblast-like cells. Two of these, the novel glycoprotein osteoinductive factor (OIF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta), act together to cause ectopic bone formation in vivo. Since OIF, like TGF beta, is likely released from bone when the matrix is resorbed, we examined the effects of homogeneous OIF and TGF beta on osteoclast function. Osteoclast function was tested in isolated avian osteoclasts and was measured in terms of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, oxygen-derived free radical production, and formation of characteristic resorption lacunae on slices of sperm whale dentine. OIF (50-100 ng/ml) inhibited the capacity of these osteoclasts to form lacunae whether assessed by the number of excavations per slice or by the total area resorbed. OIF (10-100 ng/ml) or TGF beta (10-20 ng/ml) caused a decrease in TRAP activity as well as a reduction in oxygen-derived free radical generation detected by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. TGF beta had no effect on the resorption capacity of isolated osteoclasts in concentrations that inhibited TRAP activity and nitroblue tetrazolium staining. These results suggest that growth regulatory factors, such as OIF and TGF beta, released during the resorption of bone may be endogenous inhibitors of continued osteoclastic activity. This cessation of osteoclast activity may be an essential preliminary step to the new bone formation that occurs at resorption sites during bone remodeling.\r"

  ".W": "Two cDNA probes derived from the nucleic acid sequence for the rabbit GH receptor were used to study RNA samples from normal and hypophysectomized (hypox) rat tissues by Northern analysis. Results obtained with a probe that contained a nucleotide sequence corresponding to part of the extracellular domain of the GH receptor indicated that rat liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and epididymal fat each contain a 4.4-kilobase (kb) message and one or more shorter messages that appear to be homologous to the rabbit GH receptor message. The other probe, which contained a nucleotide sequence that corresponds to the intracellular domain of the GH receptor, detected only one 4.4-kb message in these rat tissues. These results suggest that rat tissues may synthesize several forms of the GH receptor, but only one form that contains a region homologous to the intracellular domain of the rabbit liver GH receptor. Hypophysectomy increased the abundance of the 4.4-kb message 5-fold in muscle and reduced it by a factor of 2 in adipose tissue. No significant difference was seen between GH receptor message levels of normal and hypox rat liver when the results were expressed as a fraction of the total RNA. The level of the beta-actin message was also measured in liver, muscle, and fat from normal and hypox rats. No significant differences were found when the message levels in normal rats were compared to those for the corresponding tissue in hypox rats. When normalized to the beta-actin message levels, a significant increase was seen in the relative amount of the GH receptor mRNA in muscle and liver of hypox rats. The increased levels of the GH receptor message in muscle and liver and the simultaneous decreased level in fat suggest that GH receptor synthesis may be regulated selectively in these tissues by hormonal factors that are altered by hypophysectomy.\r"

  ".U": "90276346\r", 
  ".W": "We have reported that ACTH stimulation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) formation by the baboon fetal adrenal at midgestation was suppressed by estrogen. Because fetal adrenal regulation changes with advancing gestation, the action of estrogen on fetal adrenal steroidogenesis may also be dependent on the degree of fetal adrenal maturation. We examined this possibility in the present study by determining the effects of ACTH and estrogen on DHA formation by adrenal cells of fetuses obtained from baboons at mid- and late gestation and from animals administered the antiestrogen MER-25 throughout late gestation. Because low density lipoprotein (LDL) provides substrate for the fetal adrenal, we also determined whether the effect of estrogen was mediated by LDL uptake. Adrenals were removed from baboon fetuses on day 100 (midgestation; n = 7) and day 170 (late gestation; n = 6; term, day 184) of gestation from untreated animals and on day 170 from fetuses whose mothers were treated with MER-25 on days 140-170 (25 mg/kg BW.day; n = 7). Cells were dispersed with 0.2% collagenase and incubated at 37 C for 3 h in 4 ml medium 199 with 10 nM ACTH, 10(-6) M estradiol and/or 500 micrograms LDL. The secretion of DHA into medium was determined by RIA. At midgestation, mean (+/- SE) basal DHA formation (nanograms per 10(5) cells/3 h) was 5.8 +/- 2.1, and DHA was increased (P less than 0.01) by ACTH to 20.0 +/- 5.9. Although estradiol alone had no effect, estradiol prevented the increase in DHA obtained with ACTH. Basal DHA production by adrenals of late gestation (0.7 +/- 0.3 ng/10(5) cells) was lower (P less than 0.01) than at midgestation. ACTH increased (P less than 0.01) DHA in a comparable manner near term in the presence (2.0 +/- 0.4) or absence (1.7 +/- 0.4) of estradiol. Thus, in contrast to day 100, estrogen did not attenuate the action of ACTH on adrenal cells on day 170. In fetal adrenal cells obtained on day 170 from MER-25-treated baboons, DHA formation (1.4 +/- 0.6 ng/10(5) cells) was comparably increased (P less than 0.05) to 2.4 +/- 0.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.5 ng/10(5) cells by ACTH in the absence or presence of estradiol. Thus, ACTH remained effective in enhancing DHA by adrenal cells of fetuses exposed in utero to antiestrogen. DHA formation by adrenals of midgestation was increased (P less than 0.05) to 15.4 +/- 4.8 and 27.4 +/- 7.5 ng/10(5) cells, respectively, by LDL and ACTH plus LDL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Pigs were infused for 6 h with [14C]lysine (80 microCi/h.pig); after infusion pigs were killed, and longissimus dorsi muscle samples were obtained for RNA isolation and measurement of [14C]lysine incorporation. FSR was determined in vivo by incorporation of [14C]lysine from the muscle free amino acid pool into purified sm alpha-actin. FSR of sm alpha-actin was 55% greater in ractopamine-treated pigs than in controls. Relative mRNA abundance of alpha-actin was determined by dot blot hybridization of 0.1-0.4 microgram RNA to human sm alpha-actin [32P]cDNA probe. Longissimus dorsi alpha-actin mRNA abundance was 2-fold greater in pigs fed ractopamine. Sm RNA was translated in vitro using a cell-free assay to determine pretranslational effects on other muscle proteins. Effects of ractopamine on muscle protein synthesis are not specific to sm alpha-actin, because other muscle proteins also were increased using the in vitro translation assay. These results indicate that the increase in sm accretion in pigs fed ractopamine is due in part to an increase in myofibrillar protein synthesis and that some of the increase can be accounted for by an increase in mRNA abundance for sm alpha-actin.\r"

P450s IIIA3 and IIIA4 yielded the same metabolites at about one third the rate of P450 IA2. Low levels of estradiol hydroxylation were also catalyzed by P450s IIC9, IIIA5, and IVB1. Six other P450 forms yielded no detectable metabolism. The roles of P450s IA2, IIA3, and IIIA4 were further established by immunoinhibition using antirat P450 antibodies. Antibody that specifically binds to P450 IIIA3 and IIIA4 inhibited 60-70% of estradiol hydroxylation, and antibody against P450 IA2 inhibited 20-40% of the estradiol hydroxylase activity in microsomes from two human liver specimens, suggesting that these enzymes constitute the major forms catalyzing estradiol oxidation in human liver. Immunoinhibition results also suggest that 2-hydroxy- and/or 4-hydroxycatechol estrogens are further metabolized to other yet uncharacterized metabolites by P450s IIIA3 and IIIA4.\r"

  ".U": "90276351\r", 
  ".W": "During the first 2-3 weeks of postnatal life, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in rats exists in a relatively dormant state, termed the stress-hyporesponsive period. The development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in young rats was examined by testing the ability of the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) to stimulate CRF in vitro and ACTH in vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of 2-DG into rats 11-12 days of age or into adult rats resulted in significant hyperglycemia by 60 min that was greater in magnitude in the adults. This response was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma ACTH to levels more than 500% of the noninjected or saline-injected control values in adults. A much smaller (approximately 200%) but still significant ACTH response was observed 60 min after 2-DG injection in the neonates. The drug had no effect on the ACTH response to exogenous CRF in the neonates. The pattern of corticosterone secretion paralleled that of ACTH, with a very moderate rise (from less than 1 to 2 micrograms/dl) seen in the neonate. To test the hypothesis that CRF was driving the ACTH response to glucoprivation induced by 2-DG in the neonate and to determine the ontogeny of hypothalamic responsiveness to this stressor, complete hypothalami were existed from rats 10-35 days of age and incubated in a defined buffer containing 5.5 mM glucose with or without 22 mM 2-DG. There was no effect of the analog on CRF secretion until day 35, at which time the magnitude of the response resembled that previously reported to occur in adult tissue. To determine if the failure to observe a CRF response was due to heightened sensitivity to the negative feedback effects of glucocorticoids, 8- to 10-day-old pups were adrenalectomized and returned to their mothers for 3 days, at which time the hypothalami were removed and tested for CRF secretion. No difference was observed between basal CRF secretory rates in the control or adrenalectomized groups, and there was still no significant response to 2-DG. Moreover, adrenalectomy did not potentiate the ACTH response to injection of 2-DG in vivo. The results suggest that during neonatal life in the rat, the hypothalamic glucostat/CRF cell mechanism is incapable of promoting a normal secretory response to glucoprivation. This deficit is probably not related to the increased sensitivity to negative feedback that has been proposed to account in part for the attenuated ACTH responses to stress in the neonatal animal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This study investigated the expression of preproenkephalin mRNA in the brain and its regulation by glucocorticoids in vivo. Two different methods for mRNA quantitation were employed. Total RNA isolated from dissected brain tissue was analyzed in an RNAse T2 protection assay. In addition, we have used in situ hybridization to brain sections to assess the expression of preproenkephalin mRNA. The results demonstrate that in the striatum the preproenkephalin mRNA is expressed at a high level and is regulated by glucocorticoids. There is a decrease in striatal preproenkephalin mRNA after adrenalectomy (ADX), and ADX animals replaced with corticosterone express higher levels of striatal preproenkephalin mRNA than ADX animals. By in situ hybridization we have determined that the corticosterone-induced increase in striatal preproenkephalin mRNA is evident after 16 h, but not after 2 h, of corticosterone replacement of ADX animals. Elevation of circulating corticosterone levels in intact rats by 2-3 h of restraint stress, a multiple daily stress regimen over 1-21 days, or corticosterone injection did not change the level of preproenkephalin mRNA in the striatum; however, a single 16-h restraint stress resulted in a decreased level of expression. In intact rats there was a diurnal variation in the level of striatal preproenkephalin mRNA expression; ADX resulted in a decrease in the mRNA level, but did not abolish the diurnal variation in expression. Thus, while there is clearly regulation of striatal preproenkephalin mRNA by glucocorticoids, our results provide evidence for regulation by nonglucocorticoid mechanisms as well.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin, a cyclic tetradecapeptide, is both a hypothalamic hormone and a paracrine peptide, with effects on many tissues. Despite the fact that somatostatin can inhibit various cellular events in a number of cell lines, somatostatin is a constituent of medium defined for optimal growth of FRTL5, a line of differentiated and nontransformed rat thyroid follicular cells. In the present study we have evaluated the role of somatostatin in the control of DNA synthesis in FRTL5 cells and have investigated the mechanisms of somatostatin interaction with pathways stimulated by TSH and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Somatostatin inhibits TSH-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in FRTL5 cells. Maximal effects are observed at somatostatin concentrations of 0.1-10 ng/ml, and the effects are diminished at somatostatin concentrations above 10 ng/ml. Somatostatin also inhibits (Bu)2cAMP-stimulated DNA synthesis, suggesting that the loci of somatostatin action are both proximal and distal to activation of adenylate cyclase. Somatostatin also inhibits DNA synthesis stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a pleiotropic growth factor that works through non-cAMP-dependent pathways. The somatostatin analog octreotide is more potent than native somatostatin in inhibiting DNA synthesis stimulated by either TSH or IGF-I. Somatostatin does not alter TSH or IGF-I binding to FRTL5, demonstrating that somatostatin affects the postreceptor signal transduction pathways stimulated by these factors. We conclude that 1) the use of somatostatin in hormone-supplemented medium for FRTL5 is unnecessary and may inhibit cell growth; 2) somatostatin can inhibit the direct effects of IGF-I on peripheral tissues in addition to its ability to interfere with IGF-I synthesis by inhibiting the synthesis and release of pituitary GH; and 3) somatostatin is a useful tool for dissecting the pathways involved in mediating differentiated function and growth of FRTL5 cells.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells are induced in bone marrow cultures by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and other agents. These cells resemble osteoclasts in their morphology, their ability to resorb bone, and the possession of calcitonin receptors. We report here a biphasic effect of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) on the generation of these cells in mouse bone marrow cultures. At low concentrations (10-100 pg/ml) TGF beta enhanced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-dependent production of osteoclast-like cells, while at higher concentrations TGF beta was inhibitory. Complete inhibition was seen at 4 ng/ml. Antibodies directed against TGF beta significantly reduced the generation of osteoclast-like cells in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-treated cultures, indicating the contribution of endogenous TGF beta activity. TGF beta also enhanced the accumulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that the generation of these cells in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was also dependent on PG accumulation, since it was inhibited by indomethacin (250 ng/ml), and this inhibition could be reversed by exogenous PGE2. It is, thus, suggested that PG activity, probably PGE2, mediates the enhancing effect of low TGF beta concentrations and is required for the generation of osteoclast-like cells in this system.\r"

  ".W": "Immune responses in the uterus are depressed when concentrations of progesterone in the blood are elevated. We tested whether this action of progesterone involves induction of secretion of immunosuppressive molecules into the uterine lumen. Uterine fluid from ovariectomized ewes treated with progesterone for 60 days inhibited [3H]thymidine (TdR) incorporation by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes more than uterine flushings from vehicle-treated ewes. Uterine fluid from progesterone-treated ewes also inhibited TdR uptake by other mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes and mixed lymphocyte cultures, but had no effect on the growth of three nonlymphocyte cell lines. A group of ewes immunized with ovalbumin mixed with uterine fluid from progesterone-treated ewes produced an antibody titer that was lower than the titer for ewes immunized with ovalbumin without uterine fluid. Analysis of the physical properties of the active molecules in uterine fluid from progesterone-treated ewes indicated that activity could be separated into two fractions: a large mol wt (Mr; greater than 5000) fraction that was sensitive to pronase and a low Mr (less than 1000) fraction that was more resistant to pronase. There was more inhibitory activity in the high mol wt fraction. Further analysis of this fraction indicated that most activity was of basic isoelectric point (pI greater than 8.2). The most active fraction of basic material eluted at the void volume of a Sepharose CL-6B column (Mr, 4 x 10(6)). In conclusion, progesterone caused accumulation of factors in the uterine lumen that inhibited lymphocyte function in vitro and antibody formation in vivo. These molecules may play an important role in regulating immune responses in the uterus during pregnancy.\r"

  ".U": "90276359\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that the posterior pituitary contains a potent PRL-releasing factor (PRF). Estradiol stimulates PRL release by acting at three possible sites: the hypothalamus, the anterior pituitary, and the posterior pituitary. The objectives were 1) to document the profiles of PRL and LH release in response to an acute administration of estradiol, and 2) to identify the site of action of estradiol by employing two surgical approaches, pituitary stalk section (SS) and posterior pituitary lobectomy (LOBEX). Ovariectomized rats were used throughout. In Exp 1, rats were injected iv with 5 micrograms/kg 17 beta-estradiol, and blood was collected at 30-min intervals for 4 h. Estradiol induced a rapid and profound decline in plasma LH levels and a delayed, 5- to 6-fold rise in PRL. The purpose of the second experiment was to determine whether estradiol stimulates PRL release by acting at the anterior pituitary. Injection of estradiol to SS rats failed to stimulate a rise in PRL. We have previously reported that lactotrophs of SS rats are responsive to PRL secretagogues such as TRH. The objective of the third experiment was to differentiate between hypothalamic and posterior pituitary sites of estradiol action. Estradiol induced only a small rise in PRL when injected into LOBEX rats. However, LOBEX and control rats showed similar large rises in PRL in response to injection of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase. The latter indicates that the hypothalamic dopaminergic system as well as anterior pituitary lactotrophs are functionally intact in LOBEX rats. We conclude that estradiol administration to ovariectomized rats induces a rapid decline in LH and a delayed marked increase in PRL. The posterior pituitary, probably via PRF, is the primary site that mediates the acute effects of estradiol on PRL release. Estradiol does not stimulate PRL release directly from the anterior pituitary. The role of the hypothalamus is unclear. Estradiol could act directly on PRF-containing cells in the posterior pituitary or indirectly, via hypothalamic neurons terminating in the posterior pituitary. The hypothalamus also has a minor component that responds to estradiol and is independent of the posterior pituitary.\r"

An in vitro chemotactic system using blind well chambers and employing eosinophil-differentiated HL-60 promyelocytic cells was used as a bioassay for ECF-U activity. Dexamethasone and progesterone both antagonized the effects of estradiol on stimulation of ECF-U activity; neither hormone induced ECF-U activity when given alone. RU-486 and ketoconazole were able to block the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone and progesterone. The effects of dexamethasone and progesterone appear to be mediated through their specific nuclear receptors and are not due to direct effects on the chemotactic cell. Comparison of the steroid regulation of ECF-U activity with the estradiol-induced synthesis and secretion of complement component C3 showed that progesterone antagonized the effects of estradiol in both systems, whereas dexamethasone was antagonistic on ECF-U, but not on the secretion of C3. Taken together these results suggest that estradiol's effects in the rat uterus may be modulated by other steroids in at least two systems, bringing into question the common practice of studying uterine steroid actions by evaluation of a single protein or mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "90276366\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that androgens are potent inhibitors of breast cancer cell proliferation under both basal and estrogen-induced incubation conditions, while they suppress expression of the estrogen and progesterone receptors. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the antagonism between androgens and estrogens in breast cancer and to obtain a new tumor marker for the actions of these two steroids, we have investigated the effects of androgens and estrogens on expression of the major protein found in human breast gross cystic disease fluid, namely GCDFP-24. This study was performed in ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. After a 9-day incubation period, physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol stimulated proliferation of ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 cells by 2- to 3.5-fold while simultaneously exerting a marked 70-90% inhibition of GCDFP-24 secretion. The estrogenic effects on GCDFP-24 secretion and cell proliferation were both competitively blocked by simultaneous incubation with the new steroidal pure antiestrogen EM-139. On the other hand, a maximal concentration (10 nM) of the nonaromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone decreased by 50% the proliferation of ZR-75-1 cells; the half-maximal inhibitory effect was exerted at 0.01 nM. The androgen exerted a 3- to 4-fold stimulatory effect on GCDFP-24 secretion at an EC50 value of 0.01 nM. The effect of dihydrotestosterone on these parameters was competitively blocked by simultaneous incubation with the pure antiandrogen OH-flutamide. The present data show that the effects of estrogens and androgens in ZR-75-1 cells on GCDFP-24 secretion and cell growth are opposite. Similarly, in MCF-7 cells, estrogens stimulate cell growth, while GCDFP-24 secretion is inhibited. The present data also suggest that GCDFP-24 could well be a good biochemical marker for monitoring the response to androgenic and antiestrogenic compounds in the therapy of advanced breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The mature lung produces pulmonary surfactant, a lipid-protein complex that prevents lung alveoli from becoming atelectatic. The prenatal surge of surfactant production in preparation for birth occurs between 28-34 weeks gestation and is triggered by glucocorticoids, which stimulate surfactant synthesis by alveolar epithelial cells through a series of biochemical steps mediated by mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. In contrast to this, when explanted midgestation human fetal lung tissue is maintained in serum-free medium, there is a spontaneous increase (40%) in de novo saturated phosphatidylcholine (SPC) synthesis on the fifth day in culture. Addition of dexamethasone (DEX; 1 x 10(-8) M) to the culture medium causes the increased synthesis in SPC to occur earlier (day 4) and to a greater extent (87%). Addition of an equimolar concentration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to the medium delays both the spontaneous and DEX-stimulated increases in SPC synthesis by 24 h. Weak fetal adrenal androgens are also able to block both spontaneous and DEX-stimulated SPC synthesis. Addition of DHT to the explant cultures at daily intervals reveals that inhibition of the DEX effect occurs within the first 24 h after exposure. The antiandrogen flutamide neutralizes the effect of DHT, indicating that it acts through the androgen receptor to block the glucocorticoid. Therefore, the human fetal adrenal cortex may time lung development through both inhibitory and stimulatory mechanisms.\r"

While a saturable transport system has been demonstrated for T3 in a number of cell types, the evidence for such a system for T4 is less well established. In a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (NB41A3) the transport of T4 was found to be stereospecific, saturable, and energy dependent. When cells were incubated with radiolabeled hormone, the nuclear accumulation of L-T4 was 3.8-fold higher than that of D-T4, whereas isolated nuclei had a similar Ka for both enantiomers. Exposure of cells to antimycin and monodansylcadaverine decreased nuclear uptake of L-T4 (Ki of 197 and 55 microM, respectively), but had little effect on D-T4 uptake. Furthermore, L-system neutral amino acids, in particular L-phenylalanine at physiological concentrations, were shown to be competitive inhibitors of both T3 and T4 transport. In the presence of 0.1 mM L-phenylalanine the Km of the saturable plasma membrane transport of L-T3 increased 2.3-fold, and that of L-T4 increased 2.1-fold. In contrast, 1.0 mM L-serine or D-phenylalanine had little effect on L-T4 transport. This interaction of L-system amino acid and thyroid hormone transport may be of physiological importance.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes the function and morphology of regenerated adrenocortical nodules obtained by implanting, in the musculus gracilis of rats, several (n = 6-7) fragments of the capsular tissue of their excised adrenal glands. Four months after the operation, each bilaterally adrenalectomized rat developed six or seven well encapsulated adrenocortical nodules about 2-3 mm in diameter and always lacking chromaffin cells, and displayed almost complete normalization of basal and stimulated blood levels of corticosterone, but not of aldosterone. In vitro study showed that regenerated nodules were well functioning as far as glucocorticoid production was concerned. Accordingly, electron microscopy and stereology indicated that the majority of the parenchymal cells (independently of their location in the outer subcapsular, middle, or inner portions) closely resembled those of the zonae fasciculata/reticularis of the adrenal gland of age-matched sham-operated rats. By contrast, regenerated nodules evidenced a relative impairment in aldosterone secretion, and this was coupled with the presence of only a few zona glomerulosa-like cells. Such cells were grouped in small islets located near the few connective trabeculae detaching from the capsule, and autoradiography showed that they were the only parenchymal elements of the nodule able to bind [125I]angiotensin-II. The possibility is suggested that the paucity of zona glomerulosa-like cells in regenerated nodules could be ascribed to the absence of zona medullaris, which is currently thought to exert a paracrine control on the growth and secretion of zona glomerulosa in the rat adrenal glands.\r"

Administration of tamoxifen (1 mg/kg x day) for 60 days completely regressed the endometrial implants. When tamoxifen treatment was withdrawn, recurrence of endometrial implants was observed. Ectopic endometrial implants regressed completely 2 months after ovariectomy in rats with experimentally induced endometriosis. Tamoxifen administration (1 mg/kg x day) for 60 days to ovariectomized rats with regressed implants led to complete recurrence of ectopic endometrial implants. In ovariectomized rats administration of tamoxifen antagonized estradiol-enhanced thymidine incorporation into uterine DNA, but tamoxifen per se stimulated thymidine incorporation. This indicates the agonist/antagonist nature of tamoxifen. Treatment of rats with tamoxifen blocked the normal estrous cycle. However, serum progesterone levels were higher during tamoxifen treatment in rats with intact ovaries than in ovariectomized rats. When ovariectomized rats with regressed implants were administered tamoxifen (1 mg/kg x day) and progesterone (10 mg/kg x day) for 60 days, recurrence of ectopic endometrial implants was not observed. These findings suggest that tamoxifen is effective in regressing endometrial implants in rats with experimentally induced endometriosis, and ovarian progesterone may have a facilitatory effect.\r"

This study identifies a new family of proteins synthesized and secreted by gestation day 15 placental explants which exhibit amino acid homology to growth hormone precursors from several species. Placental explant medium was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to isolate four distinct proteins with Mr values of 28,000, 23,000, 25,000 and 30,000 and pI values of 5.7, 5.7, 5.4 and 5.3, respectively. These proteins represent a major fraction of secretory proteins with Mr in the 20,000 to 30,000 range. Immunoblot analysis showed that none of the four proteins crossreacted with antipeptide antisera against rPL-II, rPLP-A, or rPLP-B. These proteins were electrophoretically transferred from two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto an Immobilon PVDF membrane and N-terminal amino acid microsequencing carried out with a gas phase sequencer. N-terminal sequences of 45, 37, 37 and 32 amino acid residues were identified for proteins 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The four proteins exhibit 76% to 97% homology. Computer analysis further revealed a 28% identity in a 32 amino acid overlap which begins at residue 14 of the 28,000 Mr protein (protein 1) and at residue 31 of growth hormone precursors of rat, mouse and human. The 32 amino acid overlap is 78% homologous if conservative amino acid replacements are included.\r"

Additionally, hGH was more potent than hPRL in increasing mammary IGF-I mRNA content.

  ".W": "Induction of follicular growth by PMSG is associated with increased ovarian LH receptor content, whereas the preovulatory surge of LH decreases LH binding sites, followed by a secondary increase in receptor numbers coincident with corpora lutea formation. Based on the recently reported LH receptor cDNA sequence, we have performed a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to obtain LH receptor cDNA clones and generated a 32P-labeled cRNA probe to examine the dynamic changes in ovarian LH receptor mRNA levels during gonadotropin induction of follicular growth, ovulation and luteinization. Northern blot analysis of ovary RNA revealed hybridization signals of about 7.0, 4.2, 2.5 and 1.8 kb, with no hybridization to nongonadal tissues. PMSG increased the intensity of all four LH receptor messages at 24 h, preceding an increase in LH receptor number, with peak LH receptor mRNA and receptor content observed at 52 h. Treatment with hCG resulted in decreased LH receptor binding and mRNA levels by 6 h after injection, with maximal inhibition (greater than 85%) of message at 12 to 24 h after hCG treatment. Subsequently, LH receptor message levels increased again at 3 days after hCG, concomitant with increased [125I]hCG binding. A further increase in LH receptor content, but not message levels, was observed 5 days after hCG. These results demonstrate that the induction of LH receptors by PMSG is preceded by increased LH receptor mRNA levels. Furthermore, ligand-induced down-regulation of the LH receptor following an ovulatory dose of hCG is associated with decreased LH receptor message content, followed by increases in LH receptor message levels and binding sites during subsequent luteinization. Thus, the up- and down-regulation of ovarian LH receptors during follicle growth, ovulation and luteinization is probably due, at least in part, to changes in receptor message modulation.\r"

  ".W": "After initial videolaseroscopy for the treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility, 157 patients underwent a second-look laparoscopy to evaluate and treat recurrence of disease and/or adhesions. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 135 patients who underwent second-look laparoscopy for persistent infertility and/or recurrence of pain. Group 2 consisted of 22 patients who achieved pregnancy after initial surgery and underwent second-look laparoscopy for evaluation of ectopic pregnancy or in association with uterine evacuation for first trimester spontaneous abortion. Both groups of patients demonstrated a significant reduction in adhesion scores involving the ovaries, tubes, posterior cul-de-sac, anterior cul-de-sac, and omentum/bowel. Although the initial mean adhesion scores were similar for both groups, at second-look laparoscopy the mean adhesion scores were significantly lower for group 2, particularly for ovarian and tubal adhesions. None of the patients formed de novo adhesions. From these results we may conclude that videolaseroscopy: (1) is effective in reducing peritoneal adhesions; (2) is associated with a low frequency of postoperative adhesion recurrence; and (3) appears to completely avoid de novo adhesion formation.\r"

The cohort was divided into asymptomatic subjects (group I, n = 117) and those with threatening symptoms (group II, n = 104). Outcome was ascertained as viable (normal at 14 weeks, n = 131), spontaneous abortion (n = 58), or ectopic gestation (n = 32). Statistical analysis revealed no differences in the mean maternal or gestational ages among the viable pregnancies, abortions, and ectopics in group I and group II. In group I, significant differences in the means were noted for P, hCG, relaxin, and CA-125 among those destined to abort, compared with those who were not. In group II, differences were noted in P, hCG, relaxin, and E2 when viable and nonviable pregnancies were compared. Within group II, there were significant differences between the means of E2 and CA-125 when the aborters were contrasted with ectopics. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that P was the single most reliable predictor and was most effective in threatened pregnancies. Stepwise logistic regression of the six markers in group II provided an equation of possible clinical utility in differentiating abortion versus ectopic pregnancy in threatened gestations based on CA-125 and E2 levels.\r"

However, when the findings were correlated with infertility factors of patients' female partners and the subsequent pregnancy rate in a prospective study, a significant positive correlation of male Chlam AB with a tubal factor in their wives as cause of the couple's infertility was found. The results suggest that the main influence of Chlamydia trachomatis on male fertility is based on sexual transmission and negative influence on tubal function of female partners, but not on reduced sperm functional capacity.\r"

Even when these oocytes undergo nuclear maturation, fertilization, and cleavage in vitro, transfer of such embryos rarely results in pregnancy reaching delivery. We hypothesized that human embryos derived from prophase I oocytes were developmentally incompetent because they lacked a factor(s) found in in vivo matured oocytes. Using micromanipulation techniques in monkeys, we removed ooplasm from metaphase II oocytes and injected it into prophase I oocytes. After nuclear maturation, oocytes were transferred to the fallopian tube for fertilization. After ooplasmic transfusion, prophase I oocytes resulted in a delivery rate of 13%. When metaphase II ooplasm was heated or exposed to ribonuclease A before microinjection into prophase I oocytes, it lost effectiveness in conferring developmental competence.\r"

In 19 couples, throughout 31 IVF cycles, a total of 153 oocytes failed to be fertilized. In subsequent 12 cycles with zona drilling, 33 of 131 (25%) were fertilized. The incidence of teratospermia and asthenospermia was significantly higher in the study group than in the control, 74% versus 32% and 42% versus 5%, respectively. Although the mean values for the performance of sperm in SPA and fertilization of human eggs after zona drilling were remarkably similar (28 +/- 6 versus 28 +/- 4), there was no correlation between individual parameters (r = 0.15). Thus, whereas male factor infertility is more likely to be associated with teratoasthenospermia, neither the SPA nor other sperm parameters have any predictive value for failure in IVF. In addition, no criterion of sperm function has yet been identified that would eliminate oligoteratoasthenozoospermic males from consideration of IVF with zona drilling.\r"

One to 8 weeks after ablation of the inferior mesenteric plexus, sperm curvilinear and straight line swimming velocities were reduced significantly compared with sperm curvilinear and straight line swimming velocities from sham-operated controls. Sperm swimming linearity also changed significantly versus controls after inferior mesenteric plexus ablation. Additional experiments using a vasectomy model suggested that the reductions in sperm curvilinear and straight swimming velocities after inferior mesenteric plexus ablation were not primarily the result of tubal obstruction.

Two-hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients undergoing elective upper or lower endoscopic procedures under conscious sedation had oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximeter before sedation, following sedation but prior to the procedure, and while sedated and undergoing the procedure. Forty-five percent of the subjects desaturated to less than 90% without demonstrating any clinical signs of distress, including 40% of those undergoing upper procedures and 54% of those undergoing lower procedures. Neither the age of the patient, the drugs used, drug doses used, nor the type of procedure accurately predicted which patients would desaturate to less than 90%. Potentially significant oxygen desaturation cannot be reliably predicted by clinical criteria. Pulse oximetry is far more sensitive than standard clinical monitoring practices in detecting oxygen desaturation.\r"

Baseline saturations were obtained prior to premedications and continuously during the examination using a finger mounted pulse oximeter. Intravenous premedication regimens varied from none to a maximal dose of 50 mg of meperidine and 10 mg of diazepam. All colonoscopies included cecal intubation and were performed by one investigator employing a video colonoscope. The incidence of desaturation was 41% without significant variation among the sedation groups. Age was positively correlated with desaturation (p less than 0.05). Sex, obesity, history of lung or heart disease, chronic cardiac medications, and baseline saturation percentage failed to be sensitive predictors of desaturation. No parameter could be correlated with prolongation of desaturation below 90%. No adverse outcomes or complications were noted during the periendoscopy period, suggesting that oximetry monitoring during outpatient colonoscopy may not be clinically useful.\r"

The control group were: 13 men, two women; median age 30 years, range 22-41; median body weight 70 kg, range 50-79 kg. All were asymptomatic on no medication. The reflux group were: eight men, four women, median age 48 years, range 23-65; median body weight 77 kg, range 60-92 kg. Medication was withheld for 12 hours before the study. Endoscopy showed no abnormality in five patients, oesophagitis in three patients and oesophagitis with hiatus hernia in four patients. Fasted subjects were intubated with a Ryle's tube containing a pressure microtransducer within a flaccid plastic bag (800 ml). Gastric corpus-fundus pressure was recorded during distension of the bag with 460 (20) ml mean (SD) of air over 30 seconds. Pressure indices (median: range) derived from areas under the pressure curves during distension were: control: 12.7 (7.5-17.1) cm H2O; reflux: 9.1 (6.4-13.3) cm H2O, p less than 0.01 (Mann Whitney U test). Similar results were obtained from pressure indices derived from recordings during the immediate postdistension period. No correlation was found between pressure indices and age, sex or body weight. The results indicate that the gastric pressure response to distension is reduced in patients with gastrooesophageal reflux.\r"

Of the 430 patients admitted 69.5% were over the age of 60 and 30% had significant additional medical conditions. 50.4% were bleeding from peptic ulcers and one third had been taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Fifty five patients underwent surgery, which in two thirds was carried out within 24 hours of admission, usually for continued bleeding. In patients with peptic ulcer the operation rate was 21.6%. Overall mortality was 3.7%, and in those with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcers 5.5%; surgical mortality in the later group was 15.2%. All patients who died had serious concomitant pathology and 87% were over 70 years of age. Adoption of a centralised approach to management of haematemasis and melaena is feasible in a District General Hospital and associated with an improved survival.\r"

In order to investigate this paradox six healthy male volunteers received intragastric infusions of 160 ml autologous venous blood or 160 ml egg white acting as control in random order on separate days. Basal acid output was calculated before infusion, net acid secretion and gastric volume emptied were calculated after intragastric infusions. Serum gastrin concentrations were also measured before and after intragastric infusions and expressed as the integrated gastrin response. Basal acid output (mmol/h) was 4.7 (1.9) (mean (SEM)) before egg white infusion and 5.9 (2.6) before venous blood infusion. After egg white infusion net acid secretion (mmol/20 min) increased to 5.6 (3.1) compared with 2.3 (1.3) after venous blood infusion (p less than 0.05). The gastric volume emptied (ml/20 min) was less after venous blood infusion at 105 (28) compared with 321 (66) after egg white infusion (p less than 0.03). Integrated gastrin response was similar after venous blood and egg white infusion. When compared with an equivalent protein meal intragastric blood stimulates less acid secretion and delays gastric emptying. This effect may facilitate haemostasis after gastric bleeding.\r"

There was no significant difference in the median integrated 24 hour intragastric acidity between the H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative subjects (688 and 842 mmol/h/l; p = 0.271, respectively), whereas the median integrated 24 hour plasma gastrin concentration was significantly higher in the H pylori positive than in the H pylori negative subjects (389 and 198 pmol/h/l; p less than 0.001). Longterm hypergastrinaemia, associated with persistent H pylori infection, could be a cause of the increased parietal cell mass that is considered characteristic of duodenal ulcer patients.\r"

  ".W": "Eicosanoids are modulators of defensive and inflammatory processes in the gut mucosa, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory lesions of the bowel. As omega-3 fatty acids compete with the omega-6 as precursors of eicosanoid synthesis, we compared the effects of dietary supplementation with either sunflower (source of omega-6) or cod liver (source of omega-3) oil on the development of chronic granulomatous lesions in the rat colon. After four weeks on the supplemented diets, plasma omega-6 fatty acid content was significantly higher in the sunflower group, while omega-3 fatty acids predominated in the cod liver group. Inflammatory colitis was then induced by intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid. Luminal eicosanoid release, as measured by radioimmunoassay of intracolonic dialysis fluid, increased significantly after the challenge in both groups. Generation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leucotriene B4 (LTB4) peaked by day 3 and thereafter declined; thromboxane B2 (TXB2), instead, continued to increase from day 3 to 20 in sunflower fed rats, whereas this change was blunted in cod liver animals. The rats were killed 20, 30, or 50 days after the induction of colitis, and the colonic lesions were scored macroscopically (adhesions to surrounding tissues, strictures, ulcerations, and wall thickness) and histologically (ulceration, inflammation, depth of the lesions, and fibrosis). In cod liver animals, the damage score was markedly reduced by day 30, and inflammation and ulceration were almost absent by day 50.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Presented antigen together with class II molecules activates antigen specific T-helper cells and may trigger a cellular immune response. The expression of HLA-DR antigens by epithelial cells was examined with an indirect peroxidase technique in ileal biopsies from 38 patients with seronegative spondylarthropathy and features of acute or chronic gut inflammation on biopsy, 14 patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, 10 rheumatic and 10 non-rheumatic controls. In acute ileitis, there was more HLA-DR expression in villous and crypt epithelial cells than in non-inflamed controls (p less than 0.01). In chronic inflammation and in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, class II antigens were more expressed in villus (p less than 0.02) and crypt epithelium (p less than 0.01). Strong HLA-DR expression in crypt epithelial cells was connected with active inflammation (p less than 0.02). These findings suggest binding of unknown enterobacterial or nutritional luminal antigens to HLA-DR antigens normally present in enterocytes. The enterocytes act as antigen presenting cells causing a local increase of targets for activated T-cells and trigger the gut inflammation responsible for the clinical symptoms of the seronegative spondylarthropathy.\r"

This study characterizes a potassium-selective channel and contractions to barium, a potassium channel inhibitor, in vascular smooth muscle (tail artery) from spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Smooth muscle cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion, and potassium channel activity was characterized by using patch-clamp technique (inside-out configuration). Isometric contractile activity was evaluated in helically cut arterial strips by using standard muscle bath methodology. In membrane patches, a voltage-gated, calcium-insensitive, potassium-selective channel of large conductance (200 picosiemens) was observed. The channel did not conduct sodium or rubidium. Barium (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) produced a dose-dependent blockade of channel activity. These channel characteristics did not differ in SHRSP and WKY rat cells. After treatment with 35 mM KCl, barium (10(-5) to 10(-3) M) caused greater contractions in SHRSP arteries compared with arteries in WKY rats. The contractions to barium were markedly attenuated in calcium-free solution, and nifedipine and verapamil abolished contractions induced by barium in depolarizing solution. We conclude that increased vascular reactivity to barium in SHRSP arteries is not due to an alteration in the biophysical properties of the potassium channel studied.\r"

To determine the role of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) or prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) in these contractions, rings of the thoracic aorta of SHR were suspended in organ chambers for measurement of isometric force. Acetylcholine caused endothelium-dependent contractions in quiescent rings from SHR aortas. Oxygen-derived free radicals generated with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase caused contractions in rings without endothelium. Dazoxiben (thromboxane synthetase inhibitor) did not affect contractions evoked by acetylcholine. AH 23,848, SQ 29,548, or R 68,070 (TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonists) inhibited contractions to U 46,619 (a TXA2/PGH2 receptor agonist), acetylcholine, and oxygen-derived free radicals. Acetylcholine stimulated the release of prostacyclin from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat and SHR aortas but not the release of other prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2 alpha, TXA2). Oxygen-derived free radicals did not stimulate the release of prostaglandins from either SHR or WKY rat aortas. These results demonstrate that stimulation of TXA2/PGH2 receptors probably by PGH2 might be involved in endothelium-dependent contractions. Oxygen-derived free radicals, which might be an endothelium-derived contracting factor or factors, ultimately cause contraction by stimulation of TXA2/PGH2 receptors.\r"

To investigate the underlying intracellular mechanisms, we studied the effect of various concentrations of low density lipoprotein from normolipidemic subjects on concentrations of free intracellular calcium, intracellular pH, DNA synthesis, and vascular tone in vascular smooth muscle cells and rings from rat aortas. Low density lipoprotein in the range of 1-15 micrograms/ml induced a dose-dependent increase of concentration of free intracellular calcium and a biphasic change of the intracellular pH. Similar concentrations of low density lipoprotein led to an enhanced DNA synthesis. Furthermore, cumulative addition of 1-15 micrograms/ml low density lipoprotein produced a dose-dependent increase in contractile tension of thoracic aortic rings from rats. The maximal low density lipoprotein-induced contractile response was approximately 70% of that induced by 40 mM KCl. These findings indicate that low concentrations of low density lipoprotein occurring, for example, in the extravascular fluid might contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases by enhancing cell proliferation and vasoconstriction by changing intracellular calcium and intracellular pH.\r"

Either whole body autoregulation or the release of a putative ouabainlike factor from the central nervous system (CNS) could have explained these responses. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the possible contribution of a centrally released ouabainlike factor to the vasoconstriction response observed during volume expansion. Because the anteroventral third ventricle (AV3V) region is proposed to be important in the control of this putative factor, we compared the hemodynamic responses to blood volume expansion in rats with AV3V lesions (n = 6), sham lesions (n = 6), and total CNS ablation (n = 6). The results of our studies showed that neither AV3V lesion nor CNS ablation reduced the increases of total peripheral resistance seen with blood volume expansion. We conclude that centrally released factors are not required for vasoconstriction in response to acute volume expansion and that regional autoregulatory mechanisms result in a net increase of systemic vascular resistance (i.e., whole body autoregulation).\r"

The responsiveness of juxtamedullary afferent arterioles to alterations in perfusion pressure was studied in the nonclipped kidney of two-kidney, one clip hypertensive and sham-operated rats. Systolic pressure, 5-6 weeks after clipping, averaged 184 +/- 6 mm Hg in the hypertensive rats (n = 16) and 121 +/- 3 mm Hg in the sham-operated control rats (n = 7). By using the in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron technique, afferent arterioles were directly visualized, and their inside diameters were measured by videomicroscopic methods. In sham-operated kidneys perfused with blood from normotensive rats, afferent arteriolar diameter averaged 22.8 +/- 1.8 microns at a renal arterial perfusion pressure of 151 +/- 1 mm Hg and increased to 24.8 +/- 1.8 microns when perfusion pressure was reduced to 110 +/- 2 mm Hg. Conversely, in hypertensive kidneys perfused with blood from either hypertensive or normotensive rats, the afferent arterioles failed to vasodilate and actually exhibited a slight decrease in diameter from 24.6 +/- 1.3 to 23.0 +/- 2.3 microns in response to the same reduction in perfusion pressure. Vasodilator capability, however, could be demonstrated in response to verapamil and sodium nitroprusside, which increased afferent diameter in both the sham-operated and hypertensive groups of rats. Thus, unlike arterioles from normotensive rats, juxtamedullary afferent arterioles from two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats fail to vasodilate after a reduction in perfusion pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arcuate arteries from both kidneys of the sham-operated rabbits and stenotic and nonstenotic kidneys of the Goldblatt hypertensive rabbits were studied. Mean arterial blood pressures of the sham-operated and Goldblatt hypertensive rabbits were 72 +/- 2 and 85 +/- 2, and 130 +/- 3 and 125 +/- 4 mm Hg at 2 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. In vitro isometric contractile force measurements were made with a small-artery myograph. Responses to graded concentrations of norepinephrine were evoked in the arcuate arteries, and the maximum active force was developed and -log EC50 was determined. At 2 weeks after procedure, the maximum responses of the vessels from the left kidney of the sham-operated rabbits and those from the stenotic left kidney of the Goldblatt hypertensive rabbits did not differ. The responses of the vessels from the right kidney of the sham-operated rabbits did not differ from those of the nonstenotic right kidney of the hypertensive rabbits. A markedly depressed maximum response of the vessels from the nonstenotic kidney of the hypertensive as compared with the right kidney of the sham-operated rabbits was found at 12 weeks after procedure, whereas the vessels from the stenotic kidney of the hypertensive and the left kidney of the sham-operated rabbits exhibited almost identical maximal responses. Responses to U 46619 were similarly affected in the two groups of rabbits.

Intrarenal kinins can influence renal function by acting as paracrine hormones at basolateral, luminal, or both sites in the distal nephron. To examine the role of intrarenal kinins in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-treated rats, which have high renal kallikrein, Fab fragments of antibradykinin antibody or DArg[Hyp3Thi5,8DPhe7]bradykinin, a kinin antagonist, were used to block kinins. At the dose used, the antibody (25 mg) and kinin antagonist (10 micrograms/min/rat) inhibited the hypotensive effect of intra-arterially injected bradykinin (100 ng) by 70% and 52%, respectively. The antibody appeared in the urine within 30 minutes after administration. Urinary volume was lowered from 9.4 +/- 0.2 to 6.7 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/g kidney wt (p less than 0.001, paired t test) by the antibody and from 8.5 +/- 0.3 to 6.8 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/g kidney wt (p less than 0.004, paired t test) by the kinin antagonist. The antibody lowered urine sodium excretion from 1.11 +/- 0.04 to 0.88 +/- 0.06 mueq/min/g kidney wt (p less than 0.001, paired t test), whereas the kinin antagonist had no significant effect. Neither altered blood pressure, renal blood flow, or glomerular filtration rate. These data suggest that in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-treated rats, excretion of water and sodium is regulated in part by kinins. The antidiuretic effect of the antibody and kinin antagonist might be due to blockade of kinins in the vascular-interstitial space of the kidney, since the kinin antagonist is likely hydrolyzed in the proximal tubule and does not reach the lumen of the distal nephron.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Graded frequency renal nerve stimulation (0.5-4.0 Hz) and doses of norepinephrine (10-80 ng/kg) produced frequency and dose-dependent decreases in renal blood flow. The renal vasoconstrictor responses were not altered by intravenous infusion of the opioid receptor agonists methionine enkephalin (mu and delta, 75 micrograms/kg/min) or U-50488H (kappa, 20 micrograms/kg/min) or administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg i.v.). The antinatriuretic response to low frequency (less than 1.0 Hz) electrical renal nerve stimulation was prevented by naloxone but not affected by methionine enkephalin administration without changes in glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow. These studies suggest that endogenous opioid receptor mechanisms are involved in the increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption response to low frequency renal nerve stimulation but not in the renal vasoconstrictor response to either renal nerve stimulation or norepinephrine. This might occur by facilitation of the renal nerve terminal release, the direct renal tubular action, or both, of norepinephrine to influence renal tubular sodium reabsorption.\r"

The 5,000 d atrial natriuretic factor was elucidated to be a 45 amino acid peptide with the sequence of S-Q-D-S-A-F-R-I-Q-E-R-L-R-N-S-K-M- A-H-S-S-S-C-F-G-Q-K-I-D-R-I-G-A-V-S-R-L-G-C-D-G-L-R-L-F by sequencing the native peptide and its lysyl endopeptidase digests. The sequence of this peptide was identical to the amino acid sequence (51-95) of the rat brain natriuretic peptide precursor deduced from the complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence. The cardiac natriuretic peptide with a molecular weight of 5,000, or rat brain natriuretic peptide, was identified as the major storage form and as the sole secretory form derived from the brain natriuretic peptide precursor in the rat heart. The rat brain natriuretic peptide level in the atrium was 3.68 +/- 0.61 micrograms/g, which represents about 4% of that of atrial natriuretic factor. Rat brain natriuretic peptide was also detected in the ventricle. The ratio of brain natriuretic peptide to atrial natriuretic peptide in the ventricle was approximately 30% and much higher than that in the atrium. Rat brain natriuretic peptide, however, was not detectable in the brain. We conclude that the 5,000 d cardiac natriuretic peptide is rat brain natriuretic peptide with 45 amino acids derived from the brain natriuretic peptide precursor and is secreted from the rat heart as a novel cardiac hormone.\r"

In the present study, samples of cremaster and spinotrapezius muscles were taken from rats with chronic (4-week) reduced renal mass hypertension and normotensive sham-operated control rats, as well as from 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto control strain. Mean arterial pressure was 149 +/- 8 mm Hg in the rats with reduced renal mass hypertension, 114 +/- 7 mm Hg in sham-operated rats, 177 +/- 9 mm Hg in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and 95 +/- 4 mm Hg in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Muscle samples were incubated with rhodamine-labeled Griffonia simplicifolia I lectin, which identifies both perfused and nonperfused microvessels. Microvascular density was assessed by counting intersections with a 20-microns grid. Microvessel density was significantly reduced in cremaster muscles of both spontaneously hypertensive and reduced renal mass hypertensive rats, and in the spinotrapezius muscle of spontaneously hypertensive rats, compared with their respective normotensive controls. Further studies in the reduced renal mass rats on low salt diets indicated that lectin binding was also decreased as salt intake was increased, independent of blood pressure. This change was not due to an alteration in lectin-binding affinity. These studies indicate that lectin binding can be a useful tool for assessing microvessel density that does not depend on the perfusion state of the vessels and that rarefaction due to hypertension is not evenly distributed in all vascular beds. These results also provide evidence that dietary salt intake alone can influence microvessel density, as measured by the lectin technique.\r"

In this study, we examined the regulatory mechanisms of neuropeptide Y on norepinephrine release in the medulla oblongata of rats. Neuropeptide Y inhibited the stimulation-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release in a dose-dependent manner in slices of medulla oblongata of Sprague-Dawley rats (1 Hz, S2/S1 ratio, control, 0.946 +/- 0.040 [+/- SEM], n = 6; neuropeptide Y 1 x 10(-8) M, 0.676 +/- 0.022, n = 6, p less than 0.05; neuropeptide Y 1 x 10(-7) M, 0.589 +/- 0.014, n = 6, p less than 0.05). Neuropeptide Y potentiated inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine release by the alpha 2-agonists UK 14,304 and clonidine. The blockade of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by RX 781,094 diminished inhibitory effects of neuropeptide Y on norepinephrine release. Pretreatment of pertussis toxin (a toxin that interferes with the coupling of inhibitory receptors to adenylate cyclase) attenuated the suppression of norepinephrine release by neuropeptide Y. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, the inhibitory effect of UK 14,304 and neuropeptide Y on norepinephrine release from the medulla oblongata was significantly less than in age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results show that neuropeptide Y inhibits norepinephrine release partially mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and the pertussis toxin-sensitive guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins in rat medulla oblongata. Furthermore, less suppression of norepinephrine release by UK 14,304 and neuropeptide Y in spontaneously hypertensive rats suggests that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and neuropeptide Y might be involved in the regulation of central sympathetic tone in hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The extent and characteristics of reversal of baroreceptor resetting after pressure normalization were studied in rats with renal hypertension of 2 months' duration. During the control period, the displacement of the entire baroreceptor function curve was accompanied by a decrease slope, indicating that the gain sensitivity was depressed by 36% in the renal hypertensive rats. In response to changes of +10 and -10 mm Hg in the control pressure, the gain sensitivity was attenuated by 56% and 42%, respectively. Two minutes after unclipping and bleeding when necessary, mean arterial pressure decreased from 171 +/- 11 to 134 +/- 11 mm Hg and remained at approximately the same level for the 2-hour period of observation. The extent of reversal of the mean pressure threshold for activation of the baroreceptors was approximately constant (approximately 60%) in the time range of 2-120 minutes. The extent of reversal was slightly higher when the changes in systolic pressure threshold divided by the total change in control diastolic pressure were calculated (maximal of 83%). During the first 20 minutes, the displacements of the curves were parallel with no change in the depressed gain sensitivity. Complete normalization of gain sensitivity was observed after 90-120 minutes. The data indicate that, within the first 2 hours of pressure normalization of chronic renal hypertensive rats, 1) reversal of the resetting of pressure threshold is pronounced (60-80%) but still incomplete and 2) gain sensitivity returns completely to normal.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that baroreceptor reflexes are involved in the reduced nociceptive responses associated with hypertension, the effects of acute intravenous doses of serotonin (0.75-144 micrograms/kg) on inhibition of the tail-flick reflex, blood pressure, and heart rate were examined in lightly pentobarbital-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley, Wistar-Kyoto, and spontaneously hypertensive rats before and after bilateral transection of the aortic depressor nerve. Before transection, the ED50s for inhibition of the tail-flick reflex in the three strains of rats were 14, 13, and 44 micrograms/kg, respectively. After bilateral transection of the aortic depressor nerve, all three strains displayed a significant increase in sensitivity toward the serotonin-induced inhibition of the tail-flick reflex (ED50s of 7, 7, and 6 micrograms/kg, respectively). There were no changes in the cardiovascular responses to serotonin after transection of the aortic depressor nerve in Wistar-Kyoto or spontaneously hypertensive rats. In Sprague-Dawley rats, however, the cardio-pulmonary cardiovascular afferent-mediated responses were enhanced. In Sprague-Dawley rats, the nociceptive sensitivity to serotonin was unaltered when administered during either the peak increase or decrease in pressure produced by intravenous phenylephrine or nitroprusside, respectively. These results suggest that 1) afferent fibers within the aortic depressor nerve provide strong tonic inhibitory influences on the noxious information conveyed by the vagus in response to intravenous serotonin and 2) these fibers appear to produce their effects by mechanisms that are unrelated to baroreceptor function.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently reported that there are significant genetic influences on the population variation in blood pressure in black twins in Los Angeles. The present cross-sectional study was undertaken to replicate these findings in a black twin population that lives in a different biosocial environment. We chose the Caribbean island nation of Barbados, where 96% of the population is black, the literacy rate is 99%, and the access to health care is guaranteed. The goals were 1) to test the feasibility of twin studies in blood pressure research in a developing country and 2) to estimate the relative contribution of genes and environment to blood pressure variability in blacks in the Caribbean. The names of 200 twin sets were obtained with the assistance of community resources including a twin club, by media advertisement, and by asking people at public blood pressure screenings if they knew any twins. By using these methods, we identified 200 sets of twins. Of these, 37.5% (75/200) met our criteria for study. Although 97% of the sets of twins (73/75) said they were willing to participate, only 69% (52/75) were able to be scheduled during the 1 week of the study when the full team of investigators was in Barbados. Of those scheduled, 83% (43/52) were examined. Examination included medical history, physical examination, recumbent blood pressure measurements by two observers, anthropometric measurements, 24-hour urine collections for sodium and potassium tests, and blood tests for zygosity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Highly significant linear correlations were found between IC50 and pA2 (r = -0.88), between IC50 and intravenous ED30 (r = 0.79), and between pA2 and intravenous ED30 (r = -0.93). In both in vitro and in vivo functional assays, none of these antagonists exhibited agonistic effects. The orally active nonpeptide Ang II receptor antagonists EXP9270 and DuP 753 (oral ED30 = 3.6 and 0.59 mg/kg, respectively) were selected for further characterization. These antagonists exhibited selective and competitive Ang II antagonism in rabbit aorta and guinea pig ileum. In conscious normotensive rats, DuP 753 abolished the pressor response to saralasin, suggesting that the pressor effect of saralasin is attributed to its Ang II-like activity. In addition, DuP 753 also blocked the Ang II-induced drinking response and aldosterone release in rats. These results suggest that Ang II receptor blockade is the primary mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of these nonpeptide Ang II receptor antagonists. Further, the specificity and lack of partial agonistic effects of these molecules make them potentially useful physiological probes and therapeutic agents.\r"

Recently we have shown that when 3T3-L1 cells were treated with isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) to accelerate differentiation, angiotensinogen mRNA increased markedly in adipocytes as compared with preadipocytes. To determine if a correlation existed between the regulatory events associated with the differentiation process, we compared the change in angiotensinogen mRNA in spontaneously differentiating 3T3-F442A cells with two established parameters of differentiation in adipocyte cell lines. Differentiation was assessed by visual examination of cells for lipid droplets, fluorescent staining of the F-actin fibers, and increases in glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. F-actin fibers were highly structured in preadipocytes, becoming disassembled and very disorganized as cells differentiated into adipocytes. The quantity of angiotensinogen mRNA increased as the number of lipid-containing cells increased within a culture. Glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA accumulated in differentiated adipocytes to about the same extent as angiotensinogen mRNA. Thus, increases in angiotensinogen mRNA were associated with the morphological and biochemical changes that occur during the phenotypic modulation of 3T3-F442A cells.\r"

We measured pressure in pial arterioles and cerebral blood flow in normotensive and hypertensive rats during intra-atrial infusion of serotonin. In normotensive rats, pial arteriolar pressure was 48 +/- 3 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) and cerebral blood flow was 48 +/- 5 ml/min/100 g under control conditions. Intra-atrial infusion of serotonin (5 and 50 micrograms/kg/min for 5 minutes) produced only minimal changes in pial arteriolar pressure (-3 +/- 4 and -4 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively) and did not alter cerebral blood flow. In hypertensive rats, pial arteriolar pressure was 95 +/- 9 mm Hg and cerebral blood flow was 57 +/- 4 ml/min/100 g under control conditions. In contrast to normotensive rats, intra-atrial infusion of serotonin (5 and 50 micrograms/kg/min for 5 minutes) in hypertensive rats profoundly decreased pial arteriolar pressure (-29 +/- 7 and -44 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively) without altering cerebral blood flow. To determine whether altered responses of cerebral arterioles to serotonin in hypertensive rats were related to nonspecific increases in vascular reactivity, we examined the effects of angiotensin in normotensive and hypertensive rats. Responses to angiotensin (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min i.v. for 5 minutes) were not potentiated in hypertensive rats. Thus, constrictor responses of cerebral vessels to intravascular serotonin are potentiated in hypertensive rats. We speculate that when serotonin is released by platelets, augmented vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin may have important implications for the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia, and perhaps stroke, during chronic hypertension.\r"

Using radioligand binding of tritiated yohimbine to platelets, these subjects were found to have a normal complement of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors (174 +/- 18 [+/- SEM] receptors/platelet) with normal Kd (1.93 +/- 0.17 nmol/l). Lower body negative pressure was used to test responses to cardiovascular stress in the subjects after they received either placebo or 20 mg yohimbine. Graded lower body negative pressure from 0 to -40 mm Hg significantly decreased systolic blood pressure from 116 +/- 3.7 to 106 +/- 5.8 mm Hg, increased heart rate from 54 +/- 3 to 68 +/- 7 beats/min, decreased forearm blood flow from 1.8 +/- 0.21 to 1.36 +/- 0.25 ml/100 ml/min, and increased forearm vascular resistance from 55.76 +/- 12.1 to 77.26 +/- 15.8 mm Hg/ml/min. Yohimbine increased the blood pressure at rest and during lower body negative pressure, but these changes were not significantly different from values recorded from the individuals when they were given placebo. Compared with placebo, however, yohimbine significantly increased forearm blood flow at rest (1.80 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.66 +/- 0.31 ml/100 ml/min, p less than 0.05) and during -40 mm Hg of lower body negative pressure (1.36 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.91 +/- 0.28 ml/100 ml/min, p less than 0.05).

The abundance of this form follows the order spleen, kidney, brain stem and cortex, and skeletal muscle and lung and is consistent with the reported abundance and tissue distribution of the alpha 2 receptor activity. A 3.0 kb mRNA form was also detected in cerebral cortex and brain stem and a 4.1 kb mRNA form was observed in kidney under less stringent hybridization conditions. The tissue distribution of the 3.0 kb form is different from that of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors and the D2 dopaminergic receptor. The mRNA analysis combined with Southern blot analysis of rat and human genomic DNA indicate that: 1) in addition to a 3.8 kb rat alpha 2-adrenergic receptor transcript, there are other mRNA forms in the rat that do not correspond to previously described adrenergic receptor mRNA species and 2) more than one alpha 2-adrenergic receptor gene in the rat is expressed in a tissue-specific manner.\r"

To address this question, the calcium-left ventricular pressure relation during tetanization of the whole heart at different extracellular calcium concentrations (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 12.5, and 15.0 mM) was studied in 19 sodium-depleted (low sodium diet plus diuretics) and 18 control (regular sodium intake) Sprague-Dawley normotensive rats. Results showed that the maximum calcium-activated left ventricular pressure (induced by tetanization) was significantly higher in sodium-depleted than in control rats at 12.5 mM calcium concentration (170 +/- 27 [SD] mm Hg in sodium-depleted rats vs. 112 +/- 14 mm Hg in control rats, p = 0.0005). The calcium concentration at which half-maximal left ventricular pressure response was attained, however, was not different between the two groups. We conclude that long-term in vivo sodium depletion increased the maximum calcium-activated left ventricular pressure without altering the sensitivity of the contractile machinery to calcium.\r"

Then the DOCA and saline were removed, and the rats were allowed to recover for 4 weeks. Intra-arterial mean blood pressures on all rats allowed division of the rats into two matched groups, each group with an average blood pressure of 160 mm Hg. One group continued on a 0.3% NaCl diet, whereas the other group began an 8% NaCl diet for 8 weeks. After 5 weeks on these two diets, the intra-arterial blood pressure averaged 158 mm Hg in both groups. Thus, the 8% NaCl diet produced no further increase in blood pressure in the DR rats. Nevertheless, after 8 weeks on the 8% NaCl diet, 53% of the rats (26 of 49) had died; whereas in the group on the 0.3% NaCl diet, not one rat (0 of 51) had died (p less than 0.000001).

However, little is known of the exact structural changes that occur during the process of anatomic rarefaction. The purpose of this study was to examine the muscle at the ultrastructural level to search for evidence of microvessel degeneration that would correlate with the concept of anatomic rarefaction in chronic hypertension. Cremaster muscles were removed from normal rats and from rats with chronic reduced renal mass hypertension, which was produced by a 75% reduction in kidney mass followed by salt loading (4% NaCl chow with water ad libitum) for 4 weeks. The muscles were fixed and prepared for histological examination by light and electron microscopy. Atrophy and degeneration of both endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells were observed in many arterioles of the hypertensive rats. Some arterioles of hypertensive rats were degenerated to such an extent that the original identity of the cells could not be determined. The hypertensive rats also exhibited degeneration of capillaries and extravasation and uptake of red blood cells into lymphatic vessels. In contrast, age-matched control rats exhibited normal histology. The results of this study support previous physiological evidence for anatomic rarefaction in the cremaster muscle of chronically hypertensive rats.\r"

The protocol resulted in a marked reduction of the number of BFE's performed on emergency department patients from the previous level of one for every complete blood count (CBC). Retrospective chart review of a sample of patients not receiving manual BFEs indicated no apparent adverse effect on patient care. We speculate that the availability of an electronic partial differential count, providing enumeration of lymphocytes and neutrophils along with the CBC, facilitated in part the reduced ordering of manual BFEs.\r"

When either drug failed to terminate atrial tachydysrhythmias at home, the same drug always restored sinus rhythm with subsequent oral treatment during hospitalization. No major side effects were observed after the infusion of either drug. The incidence of minor side effects was not significantly different between the two drugs. Both the drugs are efficacious and safe in the acute management of primary supraventricular tachydysrhythmias. Propafenone showed a greater rapidity of action.\r"

  ".W": "The enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus cause a gastrointestinal intoxication probably via their action on intramucosal neuronal cells. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are also the most powerful mitogens known, activating CD3+ T lymphocytes of several species in a clonally variable and MHC class II-dependent fashion. We examined a possible relationship between enterotoxic and mitogenic activity of staphylococcal enterotoxin serotype B (SEB). We used a monoclonal anti-Id directed against the combining site of an anti-SEB mAb. This anti-Id failed to elicit an enteric response by itself but could block the enteric response in monkeys to a 6000-fold excess of SEB. The anti-Id was mitogenic, however, for human and monkey T cells, triggering a fraction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Not all SEB-reactive T cells were activated by the anti-Id. The anti-Id bound to T cells with a similarly low affinity as did SEB. Additional evidence for a separation of enterotoxic and mitogenic activity comes from studies with carboxymethylated SEB. Although this modified SEB had lost its enterotoxic activity, it was as mitogenic as the unmodified molecule. These results support the notion that the enteric reaction to SEB is not mediated via its effect on T lymphocytes. We conclude that SEB and anti-Id might bind to a common structure of different receptors on T cells and target cells in the intestinal mucosa, probably peripheral sensory neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the lymphocytes of naive mice produce a strong primary CTL responses in vitro to human MHC class I Ag presented by HLA-transgenic mouse (TGM) cells. A limiting dilution (LD) assay was used to analyze this xenoreactive CTL repertoire in mice. Frequencies of HLA class I-specific CTL precursors (CTLp) were estimated in naive normal and HLA-B27.2-, -B27.5- and HLA-Cw3-double TGM (i.e., mice expressing HLA and human beta 2-microglobulin (hu beta 2m]. The xenoreactive CTLp frequencies were compared to frequencies of CTLp to H-2 alloantigens estimated in naive normal mice. The results showed that the frequencies of HLA class I-specific CTLp are comparable with those of alloreactive CTLp. This overlap in CTLp frequencies suggests that HLA class I xenoantigens are recognized by primary mouse CTL as allelic variants of H-2K and H-2D. This was confirmed in split well analysis by the observation that the xenoreactive response was not restricted by self-MHC of the responding mouse. Thus, primary HLA class I-specific mouse CTL clones recognized their target Ag regardless of whether they were expressed on H-2-mismatched mouse cells or on human cells. The frequencies of HLA class I-specific CTLp in HLA-TGM were comparable to those in normal mice. We propose that MHC allo- and xenoreactive CTL responses are not caused by the activation of CTLp specific for self-MHC plus peptide but to the activation of CTLp recognizing MHC allo- and xenoantigens directly or as peptides presented by their native MHC molecules.\r"

  ".U": "90278054\r", 
  ".W": "It has generally been assumed implicitly that one can define amino acid residues of a T cell antigenic determinant peptide that interact with the MHC molecule, i.e., residues that form the \"agretope.\" However, if the same peptide can be seen in different conformations or orientations in the same MHC molecule by different T cells, then we would predict that some residues would appear to interact with the TCR of one T cell clone but with the MHC molecule as the peptide is seen by another T cell clone. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized 36 analogue peptides of an immunogenic fragment (P133-146) of sperm whale myoglobin with three different substitutions for each of 12 amino-acid residues and analyzed the role of each residue for I-Ed-binding and for activation of two Th clones, 14.1 and 14.5, specific for the peptide. The two T cell clones showed slightly different fine specificity from each other in that the truncated peptide P136-144 could stimulate 14.5 but not 14.1. The binding activity of nonstimulatory analogues to the I-Ed molecule was measured by functional inhibition analyses using truncated wild-type peptides as stimulators and nonstimulatory analogues as inhibitors. Paradoxical results were obtained that could not be explained by the peptide binding in a single way to the same I-Ed molecule. Some residues appeared to reciprocally reverse their roles for binding to I-Ed vs binding to the TCR when assessed using T-cell clone 14.5 compared to clone 14.1. These results fit the prediction of the above hypothesis and indicate the possibility that the same peptide, P133-146, can bind in more than one way to the same Ia molecule. The T cell clones, 14.1 and 14.5, appear to recognize different P133-146-I-Ed complexes in which the peptide is bound differently. Moreover, a given residue may not have a unique function of always interacting with the MHC molecule or TCR, but may change from one role to the other as it is presented to different T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Target cell lysis by CTL specific for minor histocompatibility Ag (minor HA), which were generated in (C3H/He x BALB/c)F1 mice immunized with A/J mouse spleen cells, was dramatically reduced by infection of HSV to Neuro-2a (A/J mouse origin) cells as target. The reduction was apparent at 5 h after infection of HSV to target cells, when many viral proteins were produced in the cells. Conversely, MHC-restricted HSV-specific CTL-mediated cell lysis increased time dependently. Using an RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, significant reduction of minor specific CTL-mediated target cell lysis was also found. During the time when this reduction of target cell lysis by HSV occurred, the surface expression of class I H-2Dd molecules was maintained, and anti-H-2a allo-MHC-specific CTL lysed HSV-infected Neuro-2a cells as strongly as uninfected Neuro-2a cells. When HSV-infected or uninfected Neuro-2a cells were treated with Brefeldin A that selectively blocks transportation of newly synthesized proteins out of endoplasmic reticulum, both HSV- and minor HA-specific CTL-mediated cell lyses were blocked. These observations demonstrated that minor HA are continuously synthesized and associated with class I molecules at pre-Golgi and transported via trans Golgi system with quick turnover, and that newly synthesized HSV Ag, which are also associated with class I molecules and transported via the same system, should take the place of intrinsic minor HA and be presented on the surface of the cells to be recognized by MHC-restricted CTL.\r"

  ".U": "90278056\r", 
  ".W": "We have shown that human thymic epithelial (TE) cells produce IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TE cells bind to thymocytes by CD2 and LFA-1 molecules on thymocytes and LFA-3, ICAM-1 on TE cells. We investigated whether ligand binding to LFA-3 on human TE cells can modulate TE cell IL-1 production. First, we investigated the ability of human thymocytes to regulate IL-1 release by TE cells. Both autologous and allogenic emetine-treated thymocytes when cultured with TE cells augmented IL-1 release by TE cells. The augmentation of IL-1 release was cell density dependent. Inasmuch as the interaction between thymocytes and TE cells is mediated in part by CD2 molecules on thymocytes and LFA-3 molecules on TE cells we next determined the effect on IL-1 release of ligand binding (anti-LFA-3 mAb TS2/9) to TE cell surface LFA-3. Purified anti-LFA-3 mAb augmented IL-1 release in a concentration-dependent fashion. The anti-LFA-3-mediated augmentation of IL-1 release required both new protein and RNA synthesis as shown by the ability of cycloheximide and actinomycin-D to inhibit augmentation of IL-1 production by TE cells, and by direct quantitation of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Both F(ab)'2 and Fab' fragments of anti-LFA-3 mAb augmented IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA production, indicating that monovalent binding to cell surface LFA-3 was sufficient to provide the inducing signal. The identification of LFA-3, the cell surface ligand for thymocyte CD2 molecules, as a molecule via which TE cell-derived cytokine production may be regulated suggests a mechanism at the cell surface by which direct TE cell-thymocyte interaction might result in the triggering of local IL-1 release within the human thymic microenvironment.\r"

Of six xenogeneic responses evaluated, only the human antimurine response was dependent on human APC for CTL generation. APC requirements for the other five xenogeneic responses more closely resembled those observed in the generation of human or murine alloreactive CTL. Depletion studies identified a defective human CD4+ Th cell-murine stimulator cell interaction that could be bypassed by the addition of exogenous IL-2. The function of the responder APC involved in the human antimurine CTL response was inhibited by chloroquine, suggesting a requirement for Ag processing. Effective presentation of murine stimulator Ag by human APC was completely blocked by anti-human Ia mAb, indicating that the Ag is presented to Th cells via the human class II molecule. These results are consistent with an Ia-dependent recognition of processed murine Ag by human T cells and represents a model for investigating human T cell activation requirements, Th cell function, and MHC restriction.\r"

The study was performed by using primary mixed cultures of lymphocytes from a MHC-recombinant sibling identical for MHC class II Ag (DR, DP, DQ) and displaying MHC class I disparity. Our data show that MHC class I disparity can trigger the induction of TNF receptor without promoting significant TNF production. Addition of exogenous TNF at the sensitizing phase of the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction did not result in CTL activation. However, when simultaneously added with IL-2, TNF could promote an optimal induction of cytotoxic T cell generation. The enhanced lytic ability of MHC class-I primed CTL by TNF was associated with a selective up-regulation of Tac Ag and subsequent amplification of cell proliferation. Furthermore, TNF was also found to induce a considerable increase in IL-2-induced intracellular benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzylester-esterase activity by MHC class I-primed cells. TNF did not affect the expression of LFA1, CD2, CD4, and CD8, molecules that are associated with CTL-target interactions, on responder cells. These results extend our earlier observations on the role of class I MHC molecules that may function to transduce activation signals and suggest that TNF may be a potent mediator involved in the IL-2-induced acquisition of optimal lytic competence by precursor cytotoxic T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The analysis of 30 well characterized murine T lymphocyte populations using a cytofluorometric IgA binding assay has identified many populations that are constitutive and/or inducible for IgA receptor expression, and has identified two distinct mechanisms by which IgA up-regulates the IgA-binding properties of murine T cells. Studies with lymphomas, hybridomas, Ag-specific clones and activated normal splenic T cells identified many examples of CD4 and CD8 lineage cells that constitutively expressed IgA receptors. T cell populations that constitutively expressed IgA receptors exhibited enhanced IgA binding after incubation with oligomeric IgA for 18 h. The IgA-induced up-regulation of IgA binding resulted from two distinct processes: 1) an increase in the number of surface membrane IgA binding sites and 2) an increase in the avidity of IgA binding without a change in the number of binding sites. The IgA-induced avidity increase was reflected by a 5- to 10-fold decrease in the apparent Kd. Depending on the T cell population examined the enhanced binding of IgA involved one or both of these mechanisms. T cell populations that did not constitutively express IgA receptors failed to bind IgA after prolonged incubation with oligomeric IgA suggesting that if such cells can express IgA receptors they require other signals to induce their expression. Consistent with this possibility is the finding that resting splenic T cells did not bind IgA but their activation with Con A or mAb anti-T3 resulted in high level expression of IgA receptors. These studies have identified multiple distinct mechanisms that alter the IgA-binding properties of murine T cells and are discussed in terms of their possible physiologic significance.\r"

Almost 60 to 80% of B cells expressed both FcRII and FcRIII. However, FcR alpha was expressed on only a small proportion (6%) of B cells that co-expressed FcRII. By inhibition assays with the use of cold IgG of each subclass and IgA in addition to anti-FcRII mAb (2.4G2), it was found that IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b utilized the same receptor (FcRII), whereas IgG3 and IgA bound only to their unique receptors, FcRIII and FcR alpha, respectively. Immune complexes IC prepared by IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgA anti-TNP mAb with TNP-coupled SRBC inhibited the polyclonal Ig secretion and proliferative responses of B cells stimulated with either IL-4 or LPS. The inhibition of B cell activation was associated with the blockade of the membrane depolarization. Moreover, IC prepared by these antibodies caused production of suppressive B cell factor (SBF) as is the case with rabbit IgG antibody to SRBC, and SBF thus prepared regulated antibody responses in an isotype-nonspecific manner. In contrast, no inhibition for these responses or production of SBF was attained by the IC of IgG3 antibody. We concluded that FcRII and FcR alpha mediates a suppressive signal for B cells by acting on the initial step of activation, whereas FcRIII lacks this activity.\r"

The chimeric antibodies retain identical affinity and specificity as the therapeutically effective prototype antibody, rat GK1.5, but are of different mouse isotypes. GK1.5 gamma 1, GK1.5 gamma 2a, and GK1.5 gamma 2b are significantly more effective at CD4+ cell depletion than rat GK1.5 when low doses of antibody are administered. In contrast, no depletion is seen with GK1.5 gamma 3 at any dose. Depletion of CD4+ cells in vivo is not correlated with either the ability of the antibody to mediate C-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, implying that additional antibody-mediated cytotoxic mechanisms occur in vivo. The chimeric antibodies were used to investigate the mechanism of GK1.5-mediated immunotherapy in a prototypic model of T cell-mediated autoimmunity, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Mice treated with a single dose of 100 micrograms of either GK1.5, GK1.5 gamma 1, or GK1.5 gamma 2a showed significant recovery within 72 h. In contrast, mice treated with 100 micrograms of GK1.5 gamma 3 showed only marginal improvement within the first 72 h and regressed within 5 days of treatment initiation. These data suggest that anti-CD4-mediated immunotherapy of murine experimental allergic encephalomyelitis is correlated with depletion of CD4+ cells.\r"

In 16 Cynomolgus renal allograft recipients, R6.5 was administered prophylactically as the sole immunosuppressive agent for 12 days (0.01 to 2 mg/kg/day). Survival in 14 recipients with technically successful grafts was significantly prolonged (24.2 +/- 2.4 vs 9.2 +/- 0.6 days for controls; p less than 0.001). Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) (ICAM-1) was expressed on vascular endothelium in the kidney and other organs in the monkey in a pattern similar to that in humans. During cellular rejection in controls, ICAM-1 expression increased on endothelial cells, infiltrating mononuclear leukocytes and tubular cells. Biopsies during R6.5 administration showed decreased T cell infiltration (CD2, CD8, CD4) compared with controls and decreased arterial endothelial inflammation. No changes occurred in circulating T cells, aside from variable coating with mIgG. In six of eight other recipients R6.5 administration (0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day for 10 days) reversed preexisting rejection that resulted from taper of Cyclosporine to subtherapeutic levels. Responding grafts showed decreased edema and hemorrhage but no consistent change in the infiltrate. At 1 h after the first dose, mouse IgG deposited primarily on the graft vascular endothelium without any change in the inflammatory infiltrate. Mouse IgG also deposited on the endothelium of normal organs without eliciting an inflammatory response and was cleared from the endothelium within 4 days. Inasmuch as the principal site of binding was the vascular endothelium, we hypothesize that the antibody blocks adhesion to graft ICAM-1 molecules on the vessels. Anti-ICAM-1 also binds to recipient cells and may interfere with Ag presentation and/or T cell interactions. Whatever the mechanism(s), these studies indicate that an anti-ICAM-1 antibody inhibits T cell mediated injury in vivo, and that ICAM-1 is a critical molecule in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection.\r"

Their role in the physiologic disposal of immune complexes formed in vivo in humans was investigated in three patients receiving radioimmunotherapy for ovarian carcinoma. On day 0 each patient received, by intraperitoneal injection, 10 mg of 131I-mouse anti-tumor mAb (10 mCi/mg). On days 1 and 2, 18 mg of trace-labeled, 125I-human anti-mouse IgG was administered by i.v. infusion over 15 min, to accelerate the clearance of the 131I-anti-tumor antibody from the circulation and reduce the radiation dose to the marrow. Sequential blood samples were obtained after the injection of the second (anti-mouse) antibody, to monitor clearance. Immune complexes (shown by sucrose gradient centrifugation to be 19 to 40 S in size) formed within 5 min, and were cleared with a half-life of 11 +/- 1.7 min in the liver. Complexes were measured by 4% polyethylene glycol precipitation, and by solid phase C3d- and C1q-binding assays. Between 8 and 11% of the total available complexed material bound to CR1 on E. Peak binding of immune complexes to red cells occurred 10 min after the maximal complex load was detected by precipitation with polyethylene glycol. At that time, immune complexes bound to E constituted one-fifth of the total circulating pool of complexes. Coincident with immune complex formation and clearance, a 47% fall in serum C4, C3, and CH50 was measured, with the deposition of up to 1230 molecules of C4, and 2590 molecules of C3 on the surface of red cells. During 20 min after immune complex formation there was a mean loss of 32% of erythrocyte CR1. The changes in complement and CR1 on E and in serum observed in these patients resembled those seen in patients with SLE: i.e., a reduction in CR1 and an increase in C3 and C4 on E, and reduced serum C.\r"

Viral isolation was more readily accomplished by MDM coculture resulting in 9 isolates being obtained exclusively by this method (macrophage tropic strains). To determine the in vivo cellular source of these isolates we separated PBMC from 5 of these 9 patients into T lymphocyte and monocyte fractions by flow microfluorometry. These fractions were then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of HIV-1 proviral DNA. In 4 out of these 5 patients HIV-1 proviral DNA could be detected exclusively in T lymphocytes but not in monocytes, although the virus could be isolated only by MDM coculture. In the remaining patient HIV could be amplified in both T lymphocytes and monocytes. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that, among T lymphocytes, only the CD4+ subset was infected with HIV. We conclude that among PBMC the most common in vivo source of HIV strains which preferentially infect macrophages in vitro is the CD4+ T lymphocyte. These data also suggest that the macrophage tropism characteristic of some HIV strains reflects predominantly an in vitro phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "In SLE and in the (NZB x NZW)F1 murine model of this disease, IgG autoantibodies are frequently produced to DNA and histones. In the present study, we define a linear epitope on histone H2B that is recognized by (NZB x NZW)F1 mice. IgG antibodies from anti-H2B positive (but not anti-H2B negative) mice bound strongly to a peptide containing the first 15 N-terminal amino acids, a region that is exposed in chromatin. Competitive inhibition studies showed that the binding of autoantibodies to H2B in ELISA as well as the binding to soluble H2B was substantially blocked by this peptide. Studies with smaller peptides mapped the epitope to residues 3-12. Individual mice recognized different residues within this region, and a sequence search did not reveal proteins other than H2B that could elicit this spectrum of antibodies. Interestingly, these autoantibody specificities were not a component of those induced in preautoimmune mice by immunization with H2B/RNA complexes or with H2B peptide 1-30 containing the autoantigenic sequence. These findings argue that recognition of a specific N-terminal region of self histone contributes to the anti-H2B autoantibody response in lupus. Autoreactive B cells with specificity for this sequence seem to develop only after the autoimmune process has been initiated.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and IL-6 are synergistic accessory signals for activation of T cells. In this study, highly purified human T cells were cultured with either a stimulating pair of anti-CD2 mAb or with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb. Monocytes, a cellfree monocyte culture supernatant or IL-1 were required for anti-CD2-stimulated T cell proliferation, and they each strongly enhanced anti-CD3-induced T cell growth. IL-6 was synergistic with IL-1 as a helper factor for T cell growth after activation via CD2, but we could not demonstrate any effect of IL-6 in the CD3 pathway. The mechanism of the synergistic helper activity of IL-1 and IL-6 on T cell activation in the CD2 pathway was further examined. IL-1 (but not IL-6) was required for induction of IL-2 production. Both IL-1 and IL-6 enhanced IL-2R (p55) expression and the proliferative response to IL-2. T cell proliferation after stimulation with anti-CD2 and IL-1 or IL-1/IL-6 proceeded through an autocrine IL-2-dependent pathway. Moreover we found that, in the absence of IL-1, IL-6 still supported a transient and limited proliferation of anti-CD2- (but not of anti-CD3-) stimulated T cells, which apparently was independent of the autocrine growth factors IL-2 or IL-4. Our data suggest that IL-6 is important as an accessory signal for T cell growth in the CD2 pathway of T cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "90278079\r", 
  ".W": "The TALL-103/2 cell line was derived from an immature acute T lymphocytic leukemia with T-myeloid differentiating capacity. The leukemic cells were first expanded in recombinant human IL-3 in which they acquired a myeloid phenotype, and subsequently were adapted to grow in human rIL-2 in which they became lymphoid committed. The TALL-103/2 cell line expresses only T cell-specific differentiation Ag (CD2, CD3, CD7, and CD8) but has retained the CD33 myeloid Ag originally present on the IL-3 expanded population. By using mAb directed at the TCR-alpha beta or specific for framework determinants on human TCR-gamma and -delta chains, the TALL-103/2 cells were shown to be WT31-, TCR delta 1+, TCS-1+, and Ti gamma A-, thus representing a T cell subset expressing the nondisulfide-linked form of the TCR-gamma delta. The TALL-103/2 cells have been maintained for more than 1 y in the presence of human rIL-2 on which they are strictly dependent. Chemical cross-linking and immunofluorescence studies indicate the presence of both high and intermediate affinity IL-2R on the TALL-103/2 cells. Whereas mAb antiTac and H-31 with reactivity to the IL-2R alpha-chain (p55) compete only partially for the IL-2-induced proliferation of these cells, mAb TU27, specific to the IL-2R beta-subunit (p75), inhibits such growth completely even at high concentrations of IL-2. The interactions of the two T cell-stimulating factors IL-1 and IL-4 on the IL-2-dependent growth of TALL-103/2 cells were investigated. IL-1 alpha synergizes with IL-2 in supporting the short and long term growth of this cell line, whereas IL-4 abrogates its growth. These effects are, at least in part, due to the modulation of IL-2R expression induced by the two lymphokines. Functionally, the TALL-103/2 cells display MHC-nonrestricted cytotoxic activity that is significantly enhanced by addition of either IL-4, IL-6, or IFN-gamma. Because of its properties and its stable requirement for IL-2 for continuous growth, this T lymphocytic leukemia-derived cell line represents an interesting model to analyze ontogeny and function of leukemic T cells.\r"

  ".U": "90278080\r", 
  ".W": "We have investigated the regulatory role of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the IL-2R mRNA. We noticed a region of striking homology (92%) between the human and bovine IL-2R cDNA in a stretch of 26 nucleotides located in the 5'-UTR. Within this 26 nucleotide region is an AUG that is out of frame with the IL-2R coding sequence. The murine IL-2R cDNA has an 11 bp direct repeat in the 5'-UTR that includes an upstream AUG, and this sequence is identical to the translational start site for the murine IL-2R protein. These observations raised the possibility that the two upstream AUG start codons might down regulate translation of the IL-2R by acting as false translational start sites. To investigate the possibility of IL-2R translational control, we examined sucrose gradient polysome profiles from Con A stimulated murine CD4+ splenocytes. The IL-2R mRNA was found in the portion of the gradient where free RNA, mono, and disomes migrate, whereas actively translated mRNA (lymphokines and beta-actin) were found in the portion of the gradient that contained the polysome fractions. This finding was consistent with translational down-regulation of the IL-2R mediated by ribosomal binding to the 5'-UTR start sites. We next examined cells transfected with the IL-2R cDNA that had the 5'-UTR deleted and compared protein expression to cells transfected with the full length construct. Flow microfluorometry analysis of cell surface IL-2R expression, showed that a clone transfected with the 5'-UTR deletion expressed five- to six-fold more IL-2R than a clone transfected with the full-length construct, even though both clones produced equivalent IL-2R mRNA levels. In clones transfected with the full length construct, the IL-2R mRNA associated with a reduced number of ribosomes compared to the mRNA in the deleted construct clones. These results indicate that sequences in the 5'-UTR of IL-2R mRNA lead to a decrease in the amount of ribosomes bound per IL-2R RNA molecule, and suggest that the level of IL-2R expression can thus be translationally down-regulated. This is the first growth factor receptor shown to be posttranscriptionally controlled at the translational level, and these findings have important implications for IL-2R synthesis and cell surface expression of this immunologically active cell surface receptor.\r"

The generated anti-Id mAb, designated DE8, specifically bound to HD11 anti-T-2 mAb, and not to IgG1 mAb of irrelevant specificity or to normal mouse Ig. DE8 inhibited the binding of HD11 anti-T-2 to T-2-BSA-coated plates, whereas a control anti-Id mAb did not, suggesting recognition of an Id determinant associated with the T-2 binding site of HD11. Moreover, the binding of HD11 to DE8 and that of DE8 to HD11 were specifically inhibited by free T-2 mycotoxin. DE8 mAb was efficient in abrogating the protective effect of HD11 in the cytotoxicity of T-2 on the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line Hep-2. In vivo immunization of BALB/c mice with DE8 conjugated to KLH induced an anti-T-2 antibody titer comparable to that obtained with T-2-OVA immunization, whereas immunization with unconjugated DE8 resulted in a lower titered anti-T-2 response. Immunization with DE8-keyhole limpet or with unconjugated DE8 induced anti-T-2 antibody responses characterized by expression of \"HD11-like\" Id and by protection against T-2 cytotoxicity. However, the T-2-OVA-induced anti-T-2 response lacked the HD11+ Id and was only partially protective against T-2 cytotoxicity. This represents the first demonstration of the use of an anti-Id based vaccine in the in vivo induction of a protective antibody response against the cytotoxicity of a nonproteinaceous, small m.w. biologic toxin, whose very toxic nature precludes its use as the immunogen.\r"

Fc gamma RIII on neutrophils is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein with an allelic polymorphism (NA1/NA2) while Fc gamma RIII on NK cells (Fc gamma RIIINK) is an exclusively transmembrane protein without the NA polymorphism. The relationship of the isoform of Fc gamma RIII expressed on cultured monocytes (Fc gamma RIIIM phi) to these two forms, however, is unclear because some evidence suggests lowered expression of Fc gamma RIIIM phi in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (unlike Fc gamma RIIINK) and a unique deglycosylated m.w. for Fc gamma RIIIM phi. In this study we demonstrate that, as with Fc gamma RIIINK, Fc gamma RIIIM phi is resistant to the action of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and is expressed at normal levels on affected (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor negative) cultured monocytes from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Fc gamma RIIIM phi is also shed from the cell surface upon incubation at 37 degrees C. However, Fc gamma RIIIM phi and Fc gamma RIIINK have different m.w. as glycosylated proteins despite the same deglycosylated m.w. Thus, each cell type appears to express distinct glycoforms. These differences in glycosylation may influence the functional properties of the receptor.\r"

  ".W": "There are two distinct genes that encode murine low affinity Fc gamma RII, murine Fc gamma RII alpha, and murine Fc gamma RII beta, which are transcribed in specific cell lineages. Fc gamma RII alpha transcripts are present in macrophages, NK cells, and mesangial cells; Fc gamma RII beta transcripts are expressed in Fc gamma R-bearing B cells, T cells, and macrophages. We have devised a sandwich ELISA to quantify the expression of Fc gamma RII alpha protein. The ELISA is specific for Fc gamma RII alpha, and does not detect the closely related Fc gamma RII beta protein. Upon stimulation with IFN-gamma the Fc gamma RII beta- macrophage cell line J774a expressed a twelvefold enhanced level of Fc gamma RII alpha protein. Peritoneal macrophages synthesized varying amounts of Fc gamma RII alpha. High levels of Fc gamma RII alpha were observed in resident and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, but no Fc gamma RII alpha was detected in Bacillus Calmette Guerin-elicited macrophages. J774a cells stimulated with rIL-6 bound approximately twice as much anti-Fc gamma RII mAb 2.4G2 IgG as did unstimulated controls. However, the Fc gamma RII alpha-specific ELISA showed no change in the amount of Fc gamma RII alpha expressed. A probe encompassing the extracellular coding sequence of Fc gamma RII beta hybridized to two distinct transcripts that were elevated in rIL-6-stimulated J774a cells. One of these transcripts had the same mobility in electrophoresis as Fc gamma RII alpha mRNA and hybridized to an Fc gamma RII alpha-specific probe, whereas the other transcript was larger and did not hybridize to probes specific for either Fc gamma RII alpha or Fc gamma RII beta. Moreover, we confirmed, with an Fc gamma RII beta-specific probe, that J774a cells do not make Fc gamma RII beta mRNA. Thus, the larger transcript appears to encode a novel Fc gamma RII. We suggest that the increased level of binding of the anti-Fc gamma RII mAb 2.4G2 to rIL-6-induced cells represents translation of a Fc gamma R distinct from Fc gamma RII alpha or Fc gamma RII beta.\r"

All RF bound to mAb II-481 in preference to mAb IV.3 (anti-human Fc gamma RII) or MOPC 141 (control mAb) which belong to the same IgG2b subclass. Five RF showed strong reactivity with II-481. No significant reactivity was observed between RF and mAb against human Fc gamma R. Non-RF human IgM did not react with any of the mAb. Clear-cut binding to II-481 was also seen with monoclonal IgM-RF derived from MRL/1 mice (mRF-2). The reaction between RF and II-481 was completely inhibited by human IgG. It was also inhibited by BHK cell extract infected with HSV-1, and with purified gE. II-481 inhibited the binding of human IgG Fc to the infected cell extract, confirming that II-481 recognizes the Fc-binding site on gE. II-481 did not react directly with human IgG or Fc of IgG. mAb to human IgG2 showed stronger binding to II-481 than to MOPC 141, suggesting II-481 has conformational similarity to human IgG H chain. These results suggest that at least some RF bear the \"internal image\" of HSV-1 Fc gamma-binding protein and support the hypothesis that some RF may be generated as anti-idiotype antibodies against antiviral antibodies.\r"

We have characterized the binding and phagocytosis of Hc yeasts by human PMN and quantified the PMN respiratory burst in response to this organism. mAb specific for CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c all partially blocked the attachment of unopsonized yeasts to PMN; a mAb to CD18 inhibited attachment by greater than 90%. Thus, human PMN recognize and bind Hc yeasts via CD18 adhesion receptors as has been found for human cultured macrophages and alveolar macrophages. Unopsonized yeasts were phagocytosed by PMN, but phagocytosis was increased markedly by heat-labile and heat-stable serum opsonins. These opsonins promoted enhanced phagocytosis of yeasts by increasing the attachment of Hc yeasts to the PMN membrane. Phagocytosis of viable or heat-killed Hc yeasts by PMN did not induce the secretion of superoxide anion (O2-) as quantified by the reduction of cytochrome c. O2- was not detected when yeasts were opsonized in normal serum or immune serum, or at a ratio of yeasts to PMN of up to a 100:1. However, phagocytosis of opsonized yeasts by PMN did not prevent them from subsequently releasing O2- after further incubation with opsonized zymosan or PMA. Opsonized Hc yeasts clearly stimulated the PMN respiratory burst as quantified by intracellular reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium, reduction of cytochrome c in the presence of cytochalasin D, oxygen consumption, luminol-enhanced and nonenhanced chemiluminescence, and H2O2 production. These data suggest that phagocytosis of Hc yeasts by PMN is associated with intracellular entrapment of O2- that is not detectable by reduction of extracellular cytochrome c.\r"

  ".W": "Our study has examined the synthesis of platelet activating factor (PAF; 1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and of structurally related molecules by an enriched preparation (greater than 70%) of the human lung mast cell (HLMC) in response to immunologic stimulation. Upon activation with anti-IgE, HLMC incorporated exogenously provided acetate into a phospholipid that migrated with authentic PAF on TLC. The formation of this product in HLMC occurred concomitantly with histamine and leukotriene C4 release. Further analysis of this phospholipid revealed that 1-acyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (GPC) and not 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC was the major 1-radyl-2-acetyl-GPC subclass formed during cell activation. The presence of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC was confirmed by negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. In addition to this product, anti-IgE-stimulated HLMC synthesized relatively small quantities of another 2-acetylated phospholipid migrating on TLC between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol. The chromatographic characteristics of this product suggested that it is a subclass of 1-radyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. The catabolism of both 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC and 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC was next examined to determine if the predominant formation of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC over 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC were metabolized by the HLMC at similar rates. There was, however, a qualitative difference in the metabolic products derived from the two phospholipids. 1-Alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC was rapidly inactivated by removal of the acetate moiety at the sn-2 position followed by rapid reacylation with arachidonate. By contrast, 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC was catabolized mainly by removal of the fatty acyl moiety at the sn-1 position. These data demonstrate the natural occurrence of PAF and at least two structurally similar molecules in anti-IgE stimulated HLMC. Furthermore, an analog containing an ester linkage at the sn-1 position, 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC, appears to be the major acetylated product synthesized under these conditions.\r"

We have recently developed a method to isolate SPMN, and in this study have evaluated their ADCC activity against HSV-infected cells. SPMN were obtained by repeated washings of the oral cavity, and separated from epithelial cells by nylon mesh filtration. ADCC was quantitatively determined by 51Cr release from HSV-infected Chang liver cells. SPMN in the presence of antibody were able to destroy HSV-infected cells, but SPMN were much less effective in mediating ADCC than BPMN (3.4% vs 40.7%, p less than 0.0001). In the presence of antiviral antibody, SPMN were able to adhere to HSV-infected cells, but less so than BPMN (34% vs 67%), and specific antibody-induced adherence was significantly lower in SPMN (p less than 0.04). The spontaneous adherence to HSV-infected cells was higher for SPMN than BPMN. SPMN demonstrated up-regulation of the adhesion glycoprotein CD18, but down-regulation of the FcRIII receptor. Incubation with saliva decreased ADCC capacity of BPMN, up-regulated CD18 expression, and down-regulated FcRIII expression.\r"

  ".W": "We describe the enhancement of the antibody response against hepatitis B surface Ag by octadecyl L-tyrosine, a synthetic adjuvant designed to exert its adjuvant effect in a manner similar to that of alum because it binds soluble Ag and releases it slowly from the site of injection. Our data demonstrate that octadecyl L-tyrosine showed a significant enhancement of the antihepatitis B surface Ag response compared to that of alum in the secondary response. The most striking difference between octadecyl L-tyrosine and alum in the antihepatitis B surface Ag antibody response was the absence of IgE-specific antibodies subsequent to immunization of the Ag in octadecyl L-tyrosine. Both the optical isomers of the octadecyl esters of tyrosine were adjuvant active, however, the racemic mixture showed a significantly lowe adjuvant activity. This adjuvant has great potential to be used in humans because it is devoid of side effects as assessed by the lack of acute and chronic toxicity in mice and rats, pyrogenicity in rabbits, formation of granuloma in cats, and adjuvant arthritis in rats.\r"

  ".U": "90278093\r", 
  ".W": "The Entamoeba histolytica galactose-binding lectin is a surface glycoprotein composed of 170- and 35-kDa subunits. Inhibition of this lectin with galactose or anti-170 kDa subunit polyclonal antibody blocks amebic adherence to target cells and colonic mucin glycoproteins. We describe the properties of 10 mAb with specificity for the 170-kDa subunit. Based on competitive binding studies, six nonoverlapping antigenic determinants on the lectin were identified. The effect of the mAb on adherence of amebic trophozoites to both Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and human colonic mucins was measured. Antilectin antibodies directed against epitopes 1 and 2 enhanced adherence, with the number of amebae having at least three adherent CHO cells increasing with the addition of epitope 1 mAb from 26 +/- 9 to 88 +/- 2% and the binding of colonic mucins increasing from 34 +/- 1 to 164 +/- 3 pg/10(5) amebae. Antibody-enhanced adherence remained 90 to 100% galactose inhibitable, occurred at 4 degrees C and was not Fc mediated. Univalent Fab fragments of epitope 1 mAb augmented mucin binding by 238% and CHO cell adherence by 338%. The binding of purified lectin to CHO cells was increased from 1.1 +/- 0.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 ng/10(3) CHO cells by mAb directed to epitope 1, demonstrating that enhanced adherence was due to direct activation of the lectin. mAb to epitope 3 bound to the lectin only upon its solubilization from the membrane and had no effect on adherence. Adherence to CHO cells and mucins was inhibited from 50 to 75% by mAb to epitopes 4 and 5; epitope 6 mAb inhibited amebic adherence to CHO cells but not mucins. The pooled sera from 10 patients with amebic liver abscess blocked the binding to the 170-kDa subunit of mAb directed to all six epitopes. Striking individual variations in the effects of immune sera on adherence were observed. Although the sera of all 44 South African patients with amebic liver abscess had high titer anti-lectin antibodies, 16 patients' sera significantly (more than 3 SEM) enhanced adherence whereas 25 patients' sera significantly inhibited adherence. Antilectin antibodies exert profound functional effects on the interaction of E. histolytica with target cells and human colonic mucins. Exploration of the clinical consequences of adherence-enhancing and inhibitory antibody responses may give insight into the role of antilectin antibodies in immunity to invasive amebiasis.\r"

RGK5 transcripts are present in both mouse thymus and rat brain, as determined by Northern blot analysis. RNA transcribed in vitro from RGK5 genomic DNA directs the expression of functional potassium currents after injection into Xenopus oocytes. The currents are activated by depolarization, being half-activated at -14 mV, and inactivate almost completely during depolarizations of 1 to 2 s. The properties of the currents strongly resemble those of the type n potassium channel present on both immature thymocytes and Th lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90278100\r", 
  ".W": "A cDNA clone was isolated from a mouse pre-B cell line, the sequence of which has a very high homology with rat and human thymosin beta 4 genes. However, the mouse clone has an insertion of 98 bp relative to the published rat and human sequences upstream of the coding region. By isolation of a second set of clones from a different cDNA library and by cloning a PCR amplified region of mouse genomic DNA it was confirmed that the insertion is not a cloning artifact. Furthermore, it was shown by RNase protection assays with RNA from the pre-B cell line that two sizes of thymosin beta 4 mRNA exist, a long form containing the 98 nucleotide insertion, and a short form that corresponds to the known rat and human mRNA. The short form is about 50 times more abundant than the long form. Analysis of genomic DNA by sequencing and Southern blotting revealed that both forms are encoded by a single gene in the mouse. The two forms of mRNA arise by differential RNA splicing; the long mRNA contains three separate exons, whereas the short mRNA is missing exon 2. The long mRNA is present in two different pre-B cell lines, spleen and thymus, but could not be detected in brain, liver, and kidney. It is possible that the longer mRNA, which encodes a hydrophobic NH2-extension of six additional amino acids, plays a role in lymphocyte function or development. In contrast to the mouse which has a single thymosin beta 4 gene, rat and human have multiple homologs. Most or all of these also contain sequences that cross-hybridize with the newly discovered exon 2. A polymorphic thymosin beta 4 gene has been found in human DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Four anti-idiotopic mAB, 107, MB, AI, and AD8, react with mouse hybridoma protein 36-65 specific for the hapten p-azophenylarsonate. The four antiidiotypic antibodies do not react with hybridoma protein 36-71, a somatically mutated variant of 36-65 whose H and L chain V region sequence differs at 19 amino acid positions. To determine which regions of 36-65 are important for the interaction with each of the four anti-idiotypic antibodies, variants of 36-65 containing one or more of the 36-71 substitutions were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the rearranged 36-65 H chain V region gene, followed by expression of mutant proteins containing either the 36-65 or the 36-71 L chain in transfected hybridoma cells. Idiotypic characterization of the mutant proteins showed that reactivity correlates with the 36-65 H chain, but some contributions from the 36-65 L chain come into play. In the 36-65 H chain V region, idiotopes were mapped to the first and third complementarity-determining regions for anti-idiotypic antibodies 107, MB, and AI, and to all three complementarity-determining regions for anti-idiotypic antibody AD8. The binding of all four anti-idiotypic antibodies to hybridoma protein 36-65 was hapten inhibitable. However, a comparison between the effect of individual 36-71 substitutions on idiotope expression and their effect on Ag-binding affinity suggests that none of the four anti-idiotypic antibodies bodies mimics the structure of Ag.\r"

Previous data suggest that Lyb-2 might represent a growth factor or lymphokine receptor. Human Lyb-2 mRNA is expressed in normal human tonsils and bone marrow cells, in the pre-B cell line REH, in three Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, and in some EBV-transformed B cell lines, but not in antibody-secreting myeloma cell lines, T cell lines, or a promyelocytic leukemia cell line. These data indicate that expression of human Lyb-2 is restricted to B lineage cells and turned off in antibody-secreting plasma cells. A polyclonal mouse antiserum was raised against human Lyb-2 and immunoprecipitates a Mr 42,000 protein from REH, Raji, and Daudi cells and from mouse L(tk) cells transfected with the human Lyb-2 cDNA in an expression vector. The human Lyb-2 protein is related to both the asialoglycoprotein receptor and CD23, the B cell-specific FcR for IgE. These data demonstrate that human B cells express a previously undescribed cell surface protein that is homologous to mouse Lyb-2 and has a similar pattern of expression during B cell development.\r"

While i.m. inoculation of 10(4) cells from each lymphoma generally caused death of all syngeneic recipients by 18 days post-inoculation, one of the lymphomas (UG2) was unique in that the same number of cells, when inoculated i.v., caused less than 20% mortality by that time. Lethality induced by cells from the other three lymphomas, when inoculated i.v., was as high or higher than when inoculated i.m. Mortality after intra-abdominal or s.c. inoculation of cells from all four lymphomas was similar to that after i.m. inoculations. Chickens inoculated with syngeneic UG2 cells by the i.v. route were significantly protected against a subsequent i.m. challenge with the same or other syngeneic lymphoma cells. However, UG2 lymphoma cells were highly lethal when inoculated i.v. into birds previously treated with the antimacrophage agent carageenan or immunosuppressed by neonatal treatment with cyclophosphamide. Thus, UG2 cells are distinctive in that, when inoculated i.v., they do not cause death of syngeneic hosts but instead induce resistance to a lethal challenge.\r"

We have developed a ligand-affinity method for the medium-scale purification of these two soluble forms of the IL-2R, based on the biochemical interactions between the matrix-bound ligand (interleukin-2) and its soluble receptor. The affinity-purified IL-2R is further purified by anion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. This method has provided enough highly pure IL-2R for structure and function studies and for use in practical applications such as high-flux drug-screening assays. The purified IL-2R subsequently has been immobilized on silica gel and employed for the purification of recombinant IL-2. Receptor-affinity-chromatography-purified IL-2 contains only a highly active monomeric form of the lymphokine, in contrast to immunoaffinity chromatography where several molecular forms of IL-2 with varying degrees of biologic activity are recovered. Receptor-affinity chromatography has been successfully applied to the purification of several mutant IL-2 as well as an IL-2-Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL2-PE40) fusion protein that is a 54.5-kDa chimeric protein in which the cell recognition domain is replaced by IL-2. The IL-2-PE40 is a potential cytotoxic agent for cells bearing the IL-2 receptor.\r"

Preliminary studies have indicated a receptor for DNA on murine kidney and spleen cells which is similar in molecular weight to the human DNA receptor (30 kD). The occurrence of autoantibodies to cell-surface receptors has been described in several autoimmune diseases and we have noted that the serum of patients with lupus and similar disorders inhibit the binding of labeled DNA to human leukocytes. Using a \"dot-blot\" assay with affinity-purified human DNA receptor, sera from patients with various CTD and from healthy volunteers were screened for anti-receptor antibodies; anti-receptor antibodies were found in many patients with CTD and some of their first-degree relatives. The prevalence of anti-receptor antibodies in normal blood donors was less than 2%. It is hypothesized that anti-receptor antibodies represent an early immune response in lupus and kindred disorders and that anti-DNA antibodies may arise from the corresponding anti-idiotypic response.\r"

It is suggested that the predominantly are generatory anaemia found in prolonged cases of acute tubular necrosis, and the slow restoration of red cell mass during recovery, are due to the deficient synthesis of EPO.

The serum gamma-glutamyl transferase concentration was used as a marker of alcohol abuse. The diagnosis of homozygosity was based on a serum ferritin concentration that was persistently greater than 400 micrograms l-1 and a percentage transferrin saturation greater than 55%. Using these criteria, 17 subjects were diagnosed as homozygous, corresponding to a disease frequency of 0.0095, a gene frequency of 0.0976 and a heterozygote frequency of 0.176 (95% confidence limits: 0.135-0.213). None of the subjects had overt clinical haemochromatosis. Typing for the HLA-A, -B, -C and -DR loci showed that the HLA-A3 allele (frequency 0.6471 and relative risk 4.4) was the only independent marker for the iron-loading gene in this asymptomatic population.

A campaign launched by the National Board of Health resulted in a reduction in the number of deaths from dextropropoxyphene to 66 in 1987. The main effect of over-the-counter release of paracetamol was a dramatic increase in sales, without the epidemic of deaths observed a decade ago in the UK. It is suggested that the higher mortality of paracetamol poisonings in the UK compared to Denmark is related to the dextropropoxyphene content of the combination product, which is not available in Denmark. From an epidemiological toxicological viewpoint such combinations are not justified.\r"

  ".W": "In chance single-case observations thromboxane excretion has been reported to increase several days prior to myocardial infarction. To test its frequency and potential diagnostic value we prospectively measured thromboxane excretion in 166 consecutive patients who had presented to the emergency unit with acute chest pain indicative of ischaemia. Thromboxane excretion at presentation was increased, sometimes dramatically, in 17 of 33 (52%) patients with unstable angina, in 42 of 73 (57%) patients with definite myocardial infarction, but in only two of 14 (14%) patients with stable angina. Nineteen of 29 patients undergoing early angiography had detectable intracoronary thrombi, and these patients excreted significantly more thromboxane than patients without thrombi. Ongoing platelet activation may be detected by increased thromboxane excretion in more than 50% of the patients presenting with unstable angina and myocardial infarction, particularly in those with intracoronary thrombi, but it is not a general phenomenon that can be used in diagnosis.\r"

Muscle strength was mainly measured with a hand held dynamometer and results were expressed in relationship to a \"guideline\" range for sex: disability was expressed in terms of ordinal data with a performance score and as interval data with simple timed tests. Of 17 patients with polymyositis on immunosuppressive medication followed for a mean of 2.9 years (range 1.1 - 4.7 years) only eight became stronger one of whom died. Assessment of weakness (the major impairment), disability, body weight, creatine kinase and the patient's subjective view of their state were essential to obtaining a clear view of progress.\r"
