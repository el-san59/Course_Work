  ".W": "The function of the lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania donovani parasites was investigated in human peripheral monocytes. In contrast to wild-type L. donovani which grow in monocytes, incubation of monocytes with two variant lines of L. donovani, defective in lipophosphoglycan expression, resulted in the entry of the variant cells into the monocytes and their subsequent destruction. Passive transfer of lipophosphoglycan to the variant cells led to prolonged survival in monocytes. These results indicate that lipophosphoglycan is required by the parasite for intracellular survival. To investigate one possible protective role of the glycoconjugate, preincubation of monocytes with a suspension of lipophosphoglycan and subsequent treatment of the cells with PMA or opsonized zymosan resulted in an attenuation of the oxidative burst; the attenuation effect was concentration dependent on the glycoconjugate and independent of preincubation time. Moreover, hydrophobic beads, coated with lipophosphoglycan, were phagocytized by monocytes and found to inhibit oxygen consumption in monocytes activated with PMA. These results suggest a possible relationship between the absence of lipophosphoglycan in the variant parasites and their inability to survive within monocytes. Although the precise molecular basis remains to be elucidated, the ability of lipophosphoglycan to impair the microbial oxidative response may be a contributing factor in its requirement for intracellular survival.\r"

  ".W": "Group C human adenovirus (Ad) serotypes (e.g., Ad2 and Ad5) cause persistent infections in man. One proposed mechanisms to explain human adenovirus persistence is an ineffective CTL response due to reduced cell surface expression of class I MHC Ag on virally infected cells, an effect mediated by the 19-kDa glycoprotein encoded by Ad early region 3 (E3). In the present study, the generality of this phenomenon was tested by analyzing E3 19-kDa glycoprotein down-regulation of cell surface class 1 MHC Ag on a variety of human cell types. With the exception of the Ad5 early region 1 (E1) transformed cell line, 293, Ad2/5 infection of fibroblastic, epithelial, and lymphoid cells did not cause major decreases in surface class I Ag until the terminal stages of infection when cell death is imminent. Furthermore, newly synthesized class I Ag continued to be surface expressed on most cell types at times when infected cells contained large amounts of Ad E3 19-kDa glycoprotein. These data indicate that most types of human cells are resistant to the E3 19-kDa glycoprotein effect, suggesting that virus-specific CTL recognition and lysis of most Ad2/5-infected human cells should not be limited by E3 19-kDa-mediated reduction in class I MHC Ag expression.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence is presented for an endogenous route of Ag processing for CD4+ T cell recognition of influenza hemagglutinin that requires obligatory traffic of de novo synthesized hemagglutinin across the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for processing in a cytosolic compartment. I-Ad-restricted T cell clones that recognize synthetic peptides corresponding to two distinct antigenic regions of the HA1 subunit, HA1 56-76 and HA1 177-199, are cytotoxic and, dependent on epitope specificity can recognize endogenously processed Ag and lyse class II+ target cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia-X31 HA virus. HA1 56-76 specific T cell clones fail to recognize (target cells infected with) influenza X31 viruses, containing a single residue change, HA1 63 Asp----Asn that introduces an oligosaccharide attachment site: Asp63Cys64Thr65. Recognition is restored, however, by tunicamycin treatment of mutant virus infected target cells. Inasmuch as N-glycosylation of nascent hemagglutinin polypeptides occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, this indicates a route of endogenous processing for hemagglutinin, requiring transport across the endoplasmic reticulum, which has been confirmed by the failure of CD4+ T cells to recognize a recombinant VACC-hemagglutinin virus in which the same single residue change, HA1 63 Asp----Asn has been introduced by site directed mutagenesis.\r"

The CD38 cDNA sequence predicts an unusual 30-kDa polypeptide with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and a carboxyl-terminal extracellular domain carrying the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The absence of significant homology with other known surface Ag including members of the Ig superfamily ruled out the possibility that CD38 was the human homologue of the murine Qa2 molecule as has been suggested previously. PvuII digests of human genomic DNA revealed a polymorphism linked to the CD38 gene.\r"

After data were controlled for seasonal patterns, RSV isolations were strongly correlated with the winter peaks in lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) deaths of infants 1-11 months old; influenza virus isolations were correlated with the winter peak in LRI deaths of children 24-59 months old. The parainfluenza viruses were not correlated with respiratory deaths. This study supports the idea that RSV is a major contributor to winter peaks in LRI deaths of children 1-11 months old.\r"

Among 85 patients tested serologically for recent HAV infection, 22 (39%) of 56 susceptible patients developed acute HAV infection. Only exposure to LAK cells cultured in medium containing human serum from two specific manufactured pools was associated with HAV infection. Attack rates were 85% among patients exposed to pool X, 62% in patients exposed to pool Y, and 50% in those exposed to both pools, compared with none among the 24 susceptible persons exposed to other serum pools (P less than .001). The serum used in production of LAK cell medium was obtained from multiple paid donors. Twenty persons donated plasma to both serum pools X and Y. Although none of 12 donors tested had evidence of recent HAV infection, it is likely that an asymptomatic plasma donor viremic for HAV contaminated both serum pools and the LAK cell medium made from it.\r"

Attack rates of breakthrough infection following household exposure to varicella in 102 children and 26 adults were similar whether one or two doses of vaccine had been given. The mild breakthrough illness was also similar after one or more doses. Specific antibody titers were similar 1 year after immunization whether individuals had received one or two doses. Humoral and cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was lower in these vaccinees than in persons who had experienced natural varicella infection. Protection after natural infection in adult family members exposed to varicella was superior to that in vaccinees; none developed varicella infection. These observations suggest that immunization induces less protection than does natural disease in leukemic children and young adults. This may be partly due to the nature of the vaccine virus, but because responses of adults were similar to those of leukemic children, it suggests also that both of these groups have impaired immune responses to VZV. Boosting of humoral immunity after exposure to VZV was common and was observed in healthy adults with past natural infection and in vaccinated adults and leukemic children.\r"

Although the assays correlated well, responses to the individual neutralization proteins or to different defined antigenic sites on the same protein could be distinguished only by EBA. In general, adult vaccinees exhibited both a homotypic response to the immunizing strain and a heterotypic response to other serotypes. Infant vaccinees less than 6 months old also had a homotypic antibody response but developed significantly fewer heterotypic responses than adults (1.2% and 59%, respectively; P less than .0001). In addition, postvaccination sera from vaccinees who developed naturally occurring rotavirus diarrhea during an efficacy trial of RRV (MMU-18006) or RIT 4237 vaccine were analyzed for serotype-specific responses. The data suggest that the inability to mount a heterotypic antibody response to the infecting serotypes in young infants may have been an important factor in failure of the vaccines to induce protection.\r"

Alphaviruses replicated to a greater extent than did flaviviruses, indicating that viremia may be important in neuroinvasion. Also, some viruses (e.g., Semliki Forest virus) replicated to high titers while others (e.g., Murray Valley encephalitis virus) did not. Viruses that replicated to high titers showed luminal polarity of virus release, indicating that infection of the endothelium may be important in both maintenance of viremia and neuroinvasion; viruses that did not so replicate showed abluminal polarity of release, indicating that virus is actively transported across the endothelial monolayer, another mechanism for neuroinvasion. Infection of MBE cells with highly and less-neuroinvasive strains achieved similar results, indicating that the endothelium does not discriminate between neuroinvasive strains. However, the cerebral microvascular endothelium may be important in discriminating between viruses that invade the brain parenchyma and those that do not: neuron-tropic Ross River virus T48 replicated to higher titers than did ependymal-tropic Ross River virus NB5092. Thus, viruses probably use multiple cellular mechanisms to invade the central nervous system across the cerebral microvascular endothelium.\r"

Animal virulence studies indicated significant cutaneous virulence in immunocompromised mice models for the TK- isolates.

  ".W": "Available pneumococcal vaccines provide only limited protection for certain at-risk populations. Fifteen healthy young adults and 11 older chronic bronchitics received 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. ELISA showed that IgG reactive with capsular polysaccharides from Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 4, 8, 14, and 19F increased after vaccination. Bronchitics exhibited lesser responses for four of these serotypes, although differences between the groups were significant only for serotype 3. Adsorption of postvaccination sera with pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide significantly reduced mean antibody levels in both groups and lowered the proportion of sera that demonstrated type-specific antibody responses. Reactive IgG was largely restricted to the IgG2 subclass. Pneumococcal vaccine may provide suboptimal protection of older adults because antibody responses to some capsular polysaccharides are lower in elderly bronchitics than in healthy young adults. A substantial proportion of measured antibody reflects IgG reactive with cell wall polysaccharides rather than with type-specific, capsular constituents, suggesting that antibody responses in subjects of all ages deserve reappraisal.\r"

The hypothesis underlying the present study was that if this antibody is protective, relatively higher levels are likely to be detected in patients who are colonized by pneumococci but do not have infection, those who have febrile bronchitis but do not have pneumonia, and those who have pneumococcal pneumonia but are not bacteremic. Mean IgG reactive with CWPS by ELISA in 15 healthy young adults was 43.9 micrograms/ml and in 126 randomly selected hospital patients of all ages was 41.9 micrograms/ml. In subjects with chronic bronchitis with or without known pneumococcal carriage, mean anti-CWPS IgG was 87.7 micrograms/ml. In three groups of patients (3 with acute purulent tracheobronchitis, 13 with nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and 14 with S. pneumoniae bacteremia) at the time of admission, mean antibody levels were essentially identical, 104.9-110.1 micrograms/ml.

Fluconazole was most effective when used for preventive or early treatment of acute and subacute disseminated candidiasis. When compared with the combination of amphotericin B plus flucytosine, fluconazole was similarly effective in early treatment of acute and subacute disseminated candidiasis. When treatment was delayed 6 days after established infection, fluconazole was less active in clearing tissues in comparison with its activity in preventive and early treatment. The combination of amphotericin B plus flucytosine, however, was significantly more active than fluconazole in treatment of chronic disseminated candidiasis in all tissues.

  ".W": "An ongoing screening program for toxoplasmosis identified a cluster of four women from northern Quebec who, over a 4-month period, seroconverted during their pregnancy. An epidemiologic investigation was carried out in an attempt to identify the source of this infection. All potential risk factors were assessed by a questionnaire administered to 22 Inuit women who had delivered babies in the previous year. Seroconversion was significantly associated with skinning of animals for fur (P = .015) and frequent consumption of caribou meat (P = .034). Compared to seronegative women, women who were seropositive were more than four times more likely to have eaten dried seal meat (P = .067), more than six times more likely to have eaten seal liver (P = .064), and more than eight times more likely to have consumed raw caribou meat more than once per week (P = .054). These observations have contributed to the development of guidelines for the prevention of toxoplasmosis in seronegative pregnant women in this arctic region.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients with disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis received three intranodular injections of 10 micrograms of recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) at 48-h intervals. After 7 and 14 days, 4-mm punch biopsies were taken of control and injected nodules and processed for histology, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and parasite culture. Control sites exhibited loose infiltrates of parasitized macrophages and T cells predominantly of the CD8+ phenotype. Amastigotes were present in large numbers and were found distributed within tightly apposed endosomes and larger vacuoles. After the administration of rIL-2, there was a prominent influx of T cells, predominantly of the CD4+ phenotype, and an increased number of plasma cells. At 7 days, leishmanial amastigotes were present in either the same or somewhat reduced numbers but predominantly within large, lucent vacuoles. By 14 days the number of amastigotes was strikingly lower. Lymphokine-treated skin sites became sterile in two patients, as evaluated by parasite culture after rIL-2 injection. The results suggest that the local administration of rIL-2 induces a beneficial enhancement of the cellular immunity with a consequent disposal of parasites in the cutaneous site.\r"

Mycobacteremia was cleared in 22 of 25 patients who received this regimen, and 18 patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms associated with MAC infection. All of the patients were immunodeficient, with a mean CD4 cell count at the time of diagnosis of MAC infection of 54.7 +/- 54.6 cells/microliters. All MAC isolates were resistant to clofazimine, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Sixteen of 24 isolates were resistant to rifabutin. Improved results of treatment may be related to the use of a higher dose of rifabutin (300-600 mg/day) compared with other studies (150-300 mg/day), earlier diagnosis and institution of treatment, and synergy between rifabutin and ethambutol. The quadruple regimen used in this study appears effective in clearing mycobacteremia and in ameliorating symptoms of infection.\r"

Thus, we report a naturalistic and noninstrusive approach to the problem of identification of the premenstrual syndromes, with particular focus on the issue of compliance with 2 months of daily prospective recordkeeping. Seventy-nine patients presenting for treatment of severe premenstrual symptoms were evaluated with a structured interview, psychological tests, and 2 months of daily prospective ratings of their symptoms. Weekly group follow-up meetings were held to foster compliance with recordkeeping. The typical woman seeking treatment for premenstrual symptoms in this study was middle-aged, highly educated, highly functioning, living in an urban setting, either married with children and family responsibilities or single and living alone, and supporting herself by a high-level job. She was anxious and depressed with multiple medical and gynecological problems. Despite a highly stressful life, she functioned at a very high level, but had consulted mental health professionals in the past. In general, she did not want medication. Consistent with other reports, only 20% of women seeking treatment for premenstrual symptoms had a premenstrual syndrome prospectively confirmed on the basis of 2 months of daily ratings. However, 81% of those with a prospectively confirmed premenstrual syndrome stated that after the 2-month evaluation period their symptoms no longer interfered with their functioning.\r"

Two groups of patients were identified who must carry out different corrections on these measures during therapy in order to approximate the optimal functioning line. The appraisal/coping relationship measure appears promising as a way to reflect patient change during therapy.\r"

The deficit of the aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1 has been hypothesized to reduce the prevalence of alcohol abuse among Asians. Twenty-five percent of Koreans have been found to be deficient in the enzyme, but despite this their prevalence of alcohol abuse is higher than among Americans. Cultural issues are paramount in the much lower prevalence of alcohol abuse among women in Korea.\r"

For at least half the patients, there was a statistically significant relationship between the loudness and intrusiveness of hallucinations and the intensity of delusional beliefs; the more intrusive and distressing were the hallucinations, the more anxious and depressed were the patients. The findings suggested that more emphasis might be placed on altering patients' mood in the treatment of persistent hallucinations. The diary approach to research into auditory hallucinations appears promising.\r"

This result would imply that the contribution of the placebo effect to the pharmacotherapy of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder is negligible although considerable effort and work is still required to reliably identify one of four panic disorder with agoraphobia patients who respond to placebo. The placebo response thus presents a clear distinction between these two phenomenologically complex anxiety disorders.\r"

A selective decrease of CD4+CD45+ cell percentages and absolute numbers in chronic-progressive patients was found; in 13 out of 26 patients this subpopulation was less than 11% CD4+CD45+ cells. Similarly, the whole CD45+ cell subset, as well as CD45+ cells expressed as percentages of CD4+ cells, were significantly reduced in chronic-progressive multiple sclerosis. CD4+CD45+ cells, commonly termed \"inducer of suppression\" T-lymphocytes, did not correlate with percentages or numbers of CD8+ cells. It is concluded that suppressor inducer T-cells act on the CD8+ subset function rather than reducing CD8+ cell numbers. Since CD4+CD45+ cells represent an early stage of lymphocyte maturation (naive T-cells), an under-representation of this subpopulation in active multiple sclerosis might reflect an increased conversion of naive cells into memory cells. This concept may be relevant for a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis.\r"

Types and degrees of aphasia were classified using the Aachener Aphasie Test (AAT): 10 patients had global aphasia, 2 Broca's, 5 Wernicke's, and 5 amnesic aphasia. Four patients suffered from minimal or residual aphasic symptoms. The AAT results were compared with the regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose of the left hemisphere. Irrespective of the infarct location all five AAT subtests (Token test, repetition, written language, confrontation naming, auditory and reading comprehension) were closely correlated among each other and with left parieto-temporal metabolic rates, whereas left frontal and left basal ganglia metabolism showed no significant correlation. The close relation between left temporo-parietal functional activity and all five AAT subtests suggests that the different aspects of aphasia tested by AAT can be related to a common disorder of language processing in those areas.\r"

Overall, 66% of patients showed heterogeneous psychiatric abnormalities, most commonly a depressive syndrome (24%), whereas hysterical personality features were rare (8%). Forty-two percent of patients were unemployed. Follow-up of 41 patients (82%) showed that 34% had become seizure free. Outcome was poor in those with a long history of psychogenic seizures and pathological psychiatric findings. In contrast, almost all patients with recent onset of psychogenic seizures and normal psychological status had become seizure free. At follow-up, 56% of patients were found to be in a poor or very poor state, which resulted from a combination of physical, psychic and social problems in most cases.\r"

In general, intake was positively but weakly related to both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Associations with systolic pressure were generally stronger than those with diastolic pressure. With average daily alcohol intake categorized as none, 0.1-9.9 ml, 10.0-19.9 ml, 20.0-29.9 ml, and 30.0+ ml, mean systolic pressure, adjusted for age, body mass index, education, smoking, and physical activity, increased progressively with increasing intake in black and white men and in white women. Mean diastolic pressure increased progressively with increasing intake only in white men and women, but was highest for those averaging 30.0+ ml per day in black women as well as white men and women. Mean pressures were also compared for those averaging 75.0+ ml per day (men) or 50.0+ ml per day (women) vs those reporting no intake. Differences in adjusted mean pressures for white men were 3.2 mmHg (95% confidence limits (CL) -0.3, 6.8) for systolic pressure and 1.7 mmHg (-1.6, 5.0) for diastolic pressure. In black men differences were 4.4 mmHg (1.4, 7.4) and 3.4 mmHg (0.6, 6.3), respectively. Differences in white women were 1.4 mmHg (-2.5, 5.3) for systolic pressure and 0.9 mmHg (-2.7, 4.5) for diastolic pressure and for black women, -0.2 mmHg (-4.3, 3.8) and 1.9 mmHg (-1.9, 5.8). Separate analyses in smokers and nonsmokers of the associations between alcohol intake and blood pressure suggested that associations may differ by smoking status in some sex-race groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven (13%) of 86 women evaluated in the fourth or fifth week after the onset of menses (days 22-35) had chlamydial infection compared to 4 (1.6%) of 252 women seen in the first 3 weeks (days 1-21) (p less than 0.001). For women seen in the fourth or fifth week, the relative risk of chlamydial infection was 8.1 (95% CI, 3.1-20.6). Controlling for known risk factors for chlamydial infection with multiple logistic regression analysis, the relative risk was sustained (RR 10.8; 95% CI, 3.1-37.4). We conclude that time elapsed from the onset of menses is an important independent risk factor for chlamydial infection of the cervix that may lead to more effective and efficient screening strategies.\r"

Subjects were matched by age, sex, and the relationship between the case and his or her surrogate. For all antiperspirant/deodorant use, regardless of aluminum content, there was no association with AD (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.6-2.4). For aluminum-containing antiperspirants, the overall adjusted OR was 1.6 (95% CI = 1.04-2.4) with a trend toward a higher risk with increasing frequency of use (p for trend = 0.03), the adjusted OR in the highest tertile being 3.2. For antacids regardless of aluminum content, the overall adjusted OR was 3.1 (95% CI = 1.2-7.9). Here, a steep dose-response gradient was found (p for trend = 0.009), with an adjusted OR for the highest tertile of 11.7. However, when only aluminum-containing antacids were analyzed, the overall adjusted OR was only 0.7 (95% CI = 0.3-2.0) and there was no significant dose-response trend. These results are provocative but inconclusive due to methodologic problems relating to the necessary use of surrogate respondents and the long time period of potential exposure for this dementing disease.\r"

Increased risk of CCVD death within families was significantly related to parental age at the time of first stroke, and with the parental history of diabetes mellitus. No significant relationship was found between the children's risk of CCVD death and the stroke patient/parent's sex, race, history of hypertension or cardiac disease, stroke diagnosis (infarction vs hemorrhage), or severity upon admission. These results suggest that family histories of cerebrovascular disease may impart differential risks, depending upon a family history of diabetes, and perhaps, the ages at which ancestral strokes first occurred.\r"

These rates were compared to non-population-based minimal and maximal estimates of craniosynostosis frequency, 4/10,000 births and respectively. The rate observed in this study for definite cases, 3.1/10,000 births, is statistically consistent with the previous low estimate (observed/expected ratio 0.8, 95% CI, 0.2-1.8), and the rate observed for all cases in this study, 13.6, is consistent with the high estimate (observed/expected ratio 1.4, 95% CI, 0.8-2.1). Differences between definite and probable cases in this study are presented, along with comparisons with recent population-based data.\r"

  ".W": "Quality of life (QL) assessment is an increasingly important component of clinical research, especially with cancer patients. The literature strongly supports the view that QL should be assessed by the patient rather than the clinician. While clinical parameters such as performance status or toxicity ratings may bear some relationship to QL, they are not a substitute for its measurement. In spite of these observations, clinicians have been reluctant to accept the need for patient-rated measures of QL. In this paper, data from a sample of 109 newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients were used to examine the relationship between expert-rated measures and a patient-rated measure of QL; to determine whether the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System (CARES), an instrument for assessing the rehabilitation needs of cancer patients, is a measure of QL; to explore whether there are any medical, social or demographic variables which the clinician can use to predict how patients assess their QL; and to determine which variables (expert-rated scales, medical, social or demographic variables, or rehabilitation needs) have the most effect on how patients evaluate their QL. In this sample, patient ratings of QL were widely distributed and were only moderately correlated with the expert-rated Karnofsky Performance Status (r = 0.53) and Global Adjustment to Illness Scale (r = 0.59). In addition, there were no significant correlations between important clinical variables (axillary node status, type of surgery, receipt of chemotherapy) and patient-rated QL. Among the clinical variables and instruments studied, the Global CARES score demonstrated the best correlation (r = -0.74) with the patient-rated assessment of QL. A stepwise multiple linear regression procedure was performed with QL as the dependent variable in order to identify which factors accounted for the most variance in patient assessment of QL. The potential predictor variables used in this procedure were chosen from among those that would be available to a clinician. The Global CARES score was the best single predictor of QL, accounting for 55% of the variance, followed by Karnofsky Performance Status, the Medical Interaction and Sexual summary scales of the CARES, and the patient's educational status. Data from the CARES provided additional descriptive information about the type and frequency of rehabilitation problems experienced by these patients in relation to their ratings of QL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A review of the literature on recall accuracy suggests that the extent of inaccurate recall is related to characteristics of the exposure of interest and of the respondents, though a distinction must be drawn between recall which is biased and that which is simply inaccurate. Interviewing technique and the study protocol, including the design of questionnaires and the motivation of respondents, play a central role and are under the control of the investigator. The results of validation studies carried out to date suggest that the likelihood of recall bias may be greater when recall is poor in general.\r"

Thirteen women and 10 men between the age of 19 and 70 years experienced symptoms for a mean of 34 months preceding initial diagnosis. Eight patients had undergone treatment prior to tumor recurrence and referral. Mild neurological deficits were present in 22 patients on initial examination. The location of the tumors was predominantly cervical or cervicothoracic. Radiological evaluation revealed a wide spinal cord in all cases. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was the single most important radiological procedure. At operation, a complete removal was achieved in all patients. No patient received postoperative radiation therapy. Histological examination revealed a benign ependymoma in all cases. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 159 months (mean 62 months) with seven patients followed for a minimum of 10 years after surgery. Fourteen patients underwent postoperative MR imaging at intervals ranging from 8 months to 10 years postoperatively. No patient has been lost to follow-up review and there were no deaths. No patient showed definite clinical or radiological evidence of tumor recurrence during the follow-up period. Recent neurological evaluation revealed functional improvement from initial preoperative clinical status in eight patients, no significant change in 12 patients, and deterioration in three patients. The data support the belief that long-term disease-free control of intramedullary spinal ependymomas with acceptable morbidity may be achieved utilizing microsurgical removal alone.\r"

  ".U": "90204013\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1925 and 1945, Walter Dandy and Kenneth McKenzie performed more than 700 posterior fossa eighth nerve sections and vestibular neurectomies to treat the intractable vertigo accompanying Meniere's disease. During the past 10 years, with the aid of microsurgical techniques and the approach to the posterior fossa through the temporal bone, vestibular neurectomy has undergone a resurgence of popularity. When hearing is to be preserved, vestibular neurectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for patients who fail to undergo a remission of the vertigo attacks of Meniere's disease. This report reviews 115 consecutive vestibular neurectomies performed from 1978 to 1988 for the treatment of Meniere's disease. In 1978, retrolabyrinthine vestibular neurectomy (RVN), a procedure in which the posterior fossa is entered anterior to the sigmoid sinus and behind the labyrinth, was introduced. During the last 3 years, the approach to the posterior fossa has been a small dural opening behind the sigmoid sinus; this approach is known as the combined retrolabyrinthine retrosigmoid approach. There have been no cases of facial paralysis and no serious complications connected with this technique. A high incidence of headache (50%) resulted when the posterior wall of the internal auditory canal was drilled away for better exposure. Transient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaking occurred in 7% of the patients undergoing RVN; however, no CSF leaks occurred when the combined retrolabyrinthine retrosigmoid approach was used. In the RVN series, wound infection occurred in 20% of the cases until perioperative antibiotics reduced the rate to 3%. The results in terms of curing or improving vertigo have been excellent (94%), and hearing has been preserved to within 20 dB preoperative levels in 76% of the cases. Until a cure for Meniere's disease is found, microsurgical posterior fossa vestibular neurectomy remains the best treatment.\r"

The clinical features of these patients were studied and compared to those of 71 patients without this complication. The following characteristics were found to correlate with retrograde thrombosis: 1) advancing age of the patient; 2) large AVM size; and 3) markedly dilated and elongated feeders. It is suggested that the slow flow in the former feeding arteries that was observed immediately after AVM removal and pathological changes in these vessels due to long-standing hemodynamic stresses contributed to the development of retrograde thrombosis. Neurological manifestations related to retrograde thrombosis were noted in three of the five cases. Although infrequent, this complication should be considered as a serious possibility following removal of an AVM.\r"

The operation was performed under short-lasting barbiturate anesthesia without endotracheal intubation. Meckel's cave was cannulated with a No. 4 Fogarty catheter and the balloon was inflated for 1 minute. The average intraluminal pressure required for adequate compression of the ganglion was about 1200 mm Hg. All patients were initially relieved of their neuralgia. In a follow-up period ranging from 6 months to 4 1/2 years, 14 patients (9.7%) developed recurrence of pain between 10 and 35 months after surgery. Eleven patients underwent a second PMTG. All nine early failures and 10 of the 11 late recurrences occurred in cases with technical deficiencies. Most of the minor surgical complications observed were also related to avoidable technical errors. There were no anesthetic complications and no deaths. All patients developed mild to moderate postoperative hemifacial numbness with or without objective hypesthesia. Both subjective and objective deficits gradually diminished with time and were well tolerated. One year after the operation nearly 40% of the patients still had patches of slightly decreased sensation in one or more trigeminal divisions and 16% had mild dysesthesia. Anesthesia dolorosa or keratitis was not reported. The PMTG procedure is easy to perform and requires a short operative time and a brief period of hospitalization. It is well tolerated by patients, who describe it as a totally pain-free experience. Morbidity is minimal and recurrence of neuralgia does not seem to be higher than with alternative procedures.\r"

Twenty-two patients had bilateral vertebral artery occlusion and three had basilar artery occlusion. In this series, 69% had complete resolution of symptoms; the mortality rate was 8.4% and the morbidity rate 13.3%. Clinically stable patients did better than unstable patients. The STA-SCA anastomosis was well tolerated and technically less demanding than the OA-PICA or OA-AICA anastomosis procedures. Patients with symptomatic severe bilateral vertebral or basilar artery disease have a grave prognosis and the option of a surgical arterial pedicle revascularization procedure should be offered to them.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary experience with the occasional good survival of patients in Hunt and Hess Grade IV or V with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) led to a prospective management protocol employed during a 2 1/2-year period. The protocol utilized computerized tomography (CT) scanning to diagnose SAH and to obtain evidence for irreversible brain destruction, consisting of massive cerebral infarction with midline shift or dominant basal ganglia or brain-stem hematoma. These patients, along with those who exhibited poor or absent intracranial filling on CT or angiography, were excluded from active treatment and given supportive care only. All other patients had immediate ventriculostomy placement and, if intracranial pressure (ICP) was controllable (less than or equal to 30 cm H2O without an intracranial clot or less than or equal to 50 cm H2O in the presence of a clot), went on to have craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. Aggressive postoperative hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional therapy was subsequently employed. Of 54 patients with poor-grade aneurysms, ventriculostomy was placed in 47 (87.0%) and yielded high ICP's in the overwhelming majority, with the mean ICP being 40.2 cm H2O. Nineteen poor-grade aneurysm patients received no surgical treatment and survived a mean of 31.8 hours with 100% mortality. Thirty-five patients underwent placement of a ventriculostomy, craniotomy for aneurysm clipping and intracranial clot evacuation, and postoperative hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional therapy. The outcome at 3 months of the 35 patients who were selected for active treatment was good in 19 (54.3%), fair in four (11.4%), poor in four (11.4%), and death in eight (22.9%). It is concluded that poor-grade aneurysm patients usually present with intracranial hypertension, even those without an intracranial clot. Based on radiographic rather than neurological criteria, a portion of these patients can be selected for active and successful treatment. Increased ICP can be present without ventriculomegaly, and immediate ventriculostomy should be performed. As long as ICP is controllable, craniotomy and postoperative intensive care can effect a favorable outcome in a significant percentage of these patients.\r"

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive radiation therapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-nitrosourea (CCNU), vincristine, and prednisone. The estimated 5-year event-free survival probability was 59% for patients treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy and 50% for patients treated with radiation therapy alone, a difference which is not statistically significant. The 5-year survival probability was 65% for both groups. Although the treatment difference was not statistically significant when all patients were combined, in the small number of patients with more extensive tumors, event-free survival was better in the group receiving chemotherapy (48% vs. 0%, p = 0.006). In these latter patients the survival time is also significantly prolonged. Extent of disease (as measured by the M staging criteria described by Chang) and age at diagnosis were significantly associated with outcome; advanced disease and young age had a worse prognosis. The extent of tumor resection was not an independent prognostic factor. It is concluded that chemotherapy does not benefit patients with low-stage medulloblastoma, but may benefit those with more advanced stages of disease.\r"

Four patients are alive and off treatment without evidence of recurrence for a median period of 37 months; these included an adult with a cerebral anaplastic astrocytoma now more than 51 months after therapy. Toxicity included moderately severe myelosuppression that required hospitalization in seven patients. These results indicate that the combination of cyclophosphamide and vincristine has activity in the treatment of recurrent gliomas, and warrant the use of these drugs in larger controlled studies, particularly if they can be used in conjunction with hematopoietic growth factors.\r"

Deterioration occurred in four patients due to tumor recurrence, tumor hemorrhage, possible optic nerve necrosis, and optic chiasm herniation. Visual field improvement occurred predominantly in patients whose pretreatment visual field defects were less than a dense hemianopsia, who did not have diffuse optic atrophy, and who were younger than the median age of 69 years (p less than 0.001). Visual acuity improvement occurred in patients without diffuse optic atrophy, with only mild impairment of the visual acuity, and with only mild visual field loss prior to RT (p less than 0.002).

Nineteen patients underwent two SSEP tests 1 week apart within the first 3 weeks following injury in an attempt to identify mean SSEPu + t improvement. Somatosensory evoked potential grading was based on the presence or absence of the cortical evoked potential, the amplitude of the early cortically generated waveform (P22 or P37), and the interpeak latency across the lesion site. Mean SSEPu + t had the strongest individual relationship with outcome (R-square 0.75, p less than 0.0001) and mean SSEPu + t improvement over a 1-week interval during the first 3 weeks after injury was associated with Motor Index score improvement over a 6 month period. Joint position sense score was the best clinical predictor of outcome (R-square 0.64, p less than 0.0001). Mean SSEPu + t correlated with outcome more closely than the combination of Motor Index score and pinprick sensory score. Mean SSEPu + t in combination with all three clinical indicators produced the strongest correlation with outcome (R-square 0.87, p less than 0.0001). This study confirms the prognostic value of quantitative SSEP analysis for patients with acute spinal cord injuries.\r"

  ".W": "Reduced glutathione (gamma-glutamylcysteinylglycine, GSH) plays an important role in the protection of cells against damage from free radicals and other electrophils and also influences cellular radiosensitivity, cellular response to hyperthermia, and cytotoxicity to some kinds of chemotherapeutic agents. The concentrations of GSH in 40 primary and metastatic brain tumors were quantitatively analyzed, and GSH was localized in these tumors by a novel o-phthalaldehyde histofluorescence method. The level of GSH was 195.2 +/- 57.1 micrograms/gm (mean +/- standard deviation) in glioblastomas multiforme, 444.1 +/- 105.1 micrograms/gm in normal brain tissues, and 614.4 +/- 237.4 micrograms/gm in meningiomas. The differences in GSH levels between glioblastomas and normal brain tissues and between glioblastomas and meningiomas were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The mean GSH level in astrocytoma grades II and III was 321.9 +/- 11.8 micrograms/gm. The difference in the GSH level between glioblastomas and astrocytomas was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Radiosensitive tumors, such as multiple myeloma, germinoma, and small-cell carcinoma, showed low GSH levels. These data suggest the possibility that the GSH may be a predictor for the efficacy of radiation therapy. The cytochemical study showed GSH localized in the cytoplasm; although it stained well in meningioma tissue, GSH was not well stained in sections of multiple myeloma. The endothelial proliferation did not stain well in glioblastoma, which seems to imply that this area is vulnerable to attack by free radicals from irradiation and/or chemotherapy.\r"

The present study investigated the effect of PGE2 and agents known to increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels on 1) the induction of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of both normal and glioma patients and on 2) the cytolytic activities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL's) isolated from malignant gliomas after expansion in vitro with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Cytolytic activity was measured against autologous and allogeneic tumor cells and the natural killer-resistant Daudi cell line. The results demonstrate that PGE2 and agents known to increase intracellular cAMP levels can significantly suppress the IL-2-dependent generation of cytolytic activity from the PBL of normal and glioma patients and from glioblastoma-derived TIL's. The inhibitory effects of these agents could not be reduced by higher concentrations of IL-2 or by cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Although the suppressive effect of PGE2 was most significant during the early stages of LAK cell generation, an inhibitory effect was still evident when PGE2 was added directly to the cytotoxicity assay. Secretion of PGE2 by glioblastoma cells in vivo may regulate both the generation of an immune response and the effectiveness of adoptively transferred immune cells.\r"

  ".W": "A porcine model was developed to allow quantitative assessment of morphological changes in cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage and to determine the significance of structural changes in producing arterial narrowing. Whole blood was selectively applied to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of seven pigs. After 10 days, vessels were perfusion-fixed and examined by light and transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The MCA's exposed to whole blood for 10 days showed prominent luminal narrowing associated with profound ultrastructural changes affecting all layers of the vessel wall. Morphometric analysis, however, demonstrated that significant reductions in the luminal cross-sectional area (-55.8% +/- 12.5%, p less than 0.005) and increases in radial wall thickness (75.1% +/- 10.5%, p less than 0.005) were associated with only minimal increase in the cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (12.5% +/- 15%, p less than 0.025). By stereological analysis, the volume density of individual components of the arterial wall was unchanged in MCA's exposed to blood. Vessels exposed to blood showed a 44% reduction in smooth-muscle cell immunoreactive actin and increased collagen in the extracellular matrix of the vessel wall. These data suggest that structural changes in cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage do not directly contribute to vessel narrowing through increases in wall mass. Nevertheless, such changes may reflect pathological mechanisms which act to augment prolonged vasoconstriction or inhibit the maintenance of normal vascular tone.\r"

  ".W": "A porcine model for subarachnoid hemorrhage has been developed to allow the selective application of blood and its components to cerebral arteries. Whole blood was centrifuged to produce two fractions consisting of washed erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBC's) and white blood cells (WBC) plus platelet-rich plasma (PRP); the RBC fraction was subsequently separated into hemoglobin (Hb)-containing cytosol and erythrocyte membranes. Each fraction was selectively applied to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of pigs for 10 days; after which, vessels were perfusion-fixed and examined by light and transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemical studies. By morphometric analysis, a marked reduction in the MCA lumen cross-sectional area was observed after selective application of RBC's or Hb/cytosol but not of WBC/PRP or erythrocyte membranes. In both RBC- and Hb/cytosol-treated vessels, luminal narrowing was associated with a differential increase in vessel wall thickness of the ventral (subarachnoid) compared to the dorsal (brain) aspect of the artery, but no significant change in cross-sectional area of the vessel wall. After 10 days of exposure to RBC's or Hb/cytosol, there was a spectrum of ultrastructural changes in the vessel wall comparable to those seen after periadventitial application of whole blood. Selective application of commercially available Hb to MCA produced similar structural and morphometric changes. The degree of luminal narrowing after exposure to whole blood or RBC's was proportional to the volume of the erythrocyte mass adjacent to the vessel at sacrifice. These data suggest that arterial narrowing after SAH is mediated by mechanisms related to prolonged exposure of the vessel wall to hemoglobin or its catabolites from lysing subarachnoid erythrocytes.\r"

A competitive radioreceptor assay with 125I-epidermal growth factor and 125I-transferrin was performed using the primitive neuroectodermal tumor-derived TE-671 tissue-culture cell line as a standard. Epidermal growth factor receptors were present on TE-671 cells, all four ependymomas, and two of the four glioblastomas multiforme. The number of EGFR's per cell for ependymomas were estimated to range from 1000 to 6000. Transferrin receptors were detected on TE-671 cells, two of the four medulloblastomas, and one of the four glioblastomas multiforme. A cell surface binding assay, performed directly on the rat ependymal cell monolayer, was also analyzed. The identification of EGFR's on ependymomas and TR's on medulloblastomas suggests that malignant central nervous system tumors that spread by cerebrospinal fluid pathways may be treatable by intrathecal antibody-toxin conjugates. The presence of EGFR's on all of the ependymomas may reflect a role of the receptor in the malignant phenotype of this tumor.\r"

Eighty baboons, progeny of 6 sires and 80 dams, were either breast-fed or fed one of three infant formulas containing 2, 30 or 60 mg cholesterol/100 mL. At 16 wk of age the baboons were weaned to one of four diets containing 1.0 or 0.01 mg cholesterol/kcal with 40% of energy from saturated [polyunsaturated fat/saturated fat [P/S) = 0.37] or unsaturated fat [P/S = 2.1] and maintained on these diets until they were necropsied as young adults at 7-8 yr of age. We observed no significant effects of formula cholesterol content on serum lipid or lipoprotein concentrations measured at 6-8 yr of age, but formula cholesterol intake influenced the cholesterol turnover rate and several variables of cholesterol metabolism in the adult. At 6-8 yr, baboons that were breast-fed during infancy, compared with those that were formula-fed, had lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations and higher ratios of very-low-density plus low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL + LDL-C) to HDL-C. Breast-fed baboons, as adults, had lower cholesterol production rates, masses of the rapidly exchanging cholesterol compartment (pool A) and neutral steroid excretion rates than did those fed formula as infants. Breast and formula feeding differentially influenced the adult metabolic responses to dietary cholesterol or fat saturation. These results demonstrate that breast vs. formula feeding in infancy alters cholesterol metabolism and serum lipoprotein concentrations in adult baboons.\r"

Casein suspensions (CAS) or whey protein suspensions (WPS) were labeled with 141Ce and fed by gastric tube. Gastric emptying rate (GER) as well as gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) of the tracer were significantly longer with feeding CAS compared to WPS. The differences between the CAS and the WPS groups were partly (GER) or completely (GITT) abolished by pretreating the animals with the specific opiate-receptor antagonist naloxone. It is assumed that opioid peptides released from casein during digestion slowed gastrointestinal motility by direct interaction with gut opiate receptors. To prove whether beta-casomorphins, when given by gastric tube, can affect motility, different synthetic beta-casomorphins in doses between 1 and 10 mg were added to the WPS. The beta-casomorphin-4 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-NH2) showed no effect on GITT. The D-Ala substituted D-Ala-beta-casomorphin-4 (Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Pro-NH2) and D-Ala-beta-casomorphin-5 (Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-D-Ala-Tyr-NH2), which are more resistant to proteolytic attack and have higher opioid potency than beta-casomorphin-4, slowed GITT in a dose-dependent manner.\r"

These diets were fed for 6 wk, then some of the rats were repleted with the +B6 diet for 2 wk. Total acid-soluble carnitine (TCN) and free carnitine (FCN) levels were compared in the plasma, liver, skeletal muscle, heart muscle and urine and rats fed +B6 or -B6 diets. In -B6 rats vs. +B6 rats, TCN levels were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the plasma, skeletal muscle, heart muscle and urine, but not in the liver. However, if rats were fasted for 3 d, liver TCN concentration of -B6 rats was significantly lower than that of +B6 rats. After B6-deficient rats were repleted with the +B6 diet, the TCN level in the plasma, liver, skeletal muscle, heart muscle and urine returned to the levels of control rats. Thus, the decrease in TCN and FCN levels with a B6-deficient diet and the increase of these levels after B6 repletion provides evidence for the B6 requirement in the biosynthesis of carnitine.\r"

Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus absorption and, to a lesser extent, total diet digestibility decreased as the rats aged from 2 to 8 mo. Increased ingestion of butterfat had no effect on apparent absorption of calcium among young rats but tended to decrease calcium absorption in mature rats. The weak effect (P less than 0.05) of butterfat on calcium absorption reflected the small amount of calcium (less than 2% of fecal calcium) associated with lipids in feces. Ingestion of 10 vs. 2.5 mg Ca/g diet reduced the efficiency of apparent absorption of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus of young and mature rats and resulted in slightly, but significantly, greater retention of calcium in bone after 27 wk. The total amounts of calcium retained in tibias were correlated with the amounts of calcium absorbed by rats after 4, but not after 27, wk of dietary treatments. Rats dosed with DMH exhibited improved efficiency of calcium absorption, but the incidence of intestinal tumors did not affect mineral utilization.\r"

Animals were housed in metabolic cages and given either deionized water or water containing 4 micrograms of Se/mL as selenite for 30 d. Absorption of selenite was nearly complete, with only approximately 10% of ingested Se appearing in feces. There was a rapid rise in urinary Se that reached a plateau within a few days and accounted for 54 +/- 2% of the intake. Excretion of trimethylselenonium ion (TMSe) in urine increased rapidly, representing 35-40% of urinary Se in the supplemented animals compared with only 2% for the control group. In one experiment, rats were killed at 30 d and total carcass Se was measured using isotope dilution analysis. Supplemented rats had only a modest increase in whole body Se (94 +/- 4 micrograms Se vs. 66 +/- 3 in controls). Calculation of Se balance in the supplemented rats showed that approximately 35% of ingested Se could not be accounted for by urine plus fecal losses combined with the portion retained in the carcass. The results from this study demonstrate that under the condition of supplementation at 4 micrograms of Se/mL of drinking water, pathways other than urinary and fecal excretion may account for a substantial portion of Se loss.\r"

Rats 4 and 19-22 mo old were fed AIN-76 diet for 11-12 wk supplemented with 2.5% carbonyl iron obtained from two sources (Type A and B). Animals supplemented with Type A iron showed reduced food intake and weight gain associated with marked increases in extrahepatic and hepatic iron concentration. Rats receiving Type B iron had food intakes and body weights similar to those of controls but exhibited small increases in tissue iron concentration. Old control rats compared to young had significantly higher conjugated dienes (CD) in hepatic microsomes. Feeding Type A iron diets induced a significantly higher level of CD in hepatic microsomes from old rats compared to young rats. Iron overloaded rats also showed highly correlated (r = 0.94) increases in the urinary excretion of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and PG metabolites indicating increased in vivo LP and PG synthesis. Mitogen-stimulated PGE2 synthesis in young rats was increased at 4 wk in association with enhanced T-cell proliferation stimulated by Concanavalin A. Lymphocyte proliferation was significantly lower in old than in young control or iron-treated rats. The lack of efficacy of Type B vs. Type A iron appears due to a larger particle size and lower bioavailability. In conclusion, iron overloading increases in vivo LP and PG metabolism. Furthermore, the mitogenic response to Concanavalin A in young rats is enhanced after 4 wk of iron overloading.\r"

The consequence of this defect on the cellular CoA pool was studied in rats with functional vitamin B-12 deficiency induced by administration of the cobalamin analogue hydroxy-cobalamin [c-lactam] or by dietary vitamin B-12 deficiency. Both types of vitamin B-12 deficiency were associated with methylmalonic acidemia (100-300-fold increases in plasma methylmalonic acid concentration compared with controls), but overall fuel homeostasis was intact. Liver from rats treated with hydroxy-cobalamin [c-lactam] contained a threefold greater concentration of total CoA (free CoA plus all acyl-CoA) compared with saline-treated rats. Fractionation of the CoA pool revealed higher levels of CoA, propionyl-CoA, methyl-malonyl-CoA, acid-insoluble CoA, as well as total CoA in the rats treated with hydroxy-cobalamin [c-lactam] compared with controls. Similar increases in liver CoA content were seen in dietary vitamin B-12 deficiency in both the fed and fasted states. To examine the hypothesis that sequestration of hepatic CoA as propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA could increase CoA biosynthesis, the effect of propionate on CoA biosynthesis was studied in hepatocytes isolated from control rats. Propionate (1 mM) increased the formation of 14C-CoA from [14C]pantothenate (10 microM) by 27% in the hepatocyte system. When butyrate (1 mM) was provided as substrate, propionate (10 mM) increased [14C]CoA formation by 63%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Propranolol produced up-regulation (increased Bmax) in the frontal cortex of both control and deprived animals, whereas desipramine treatment did not induce down-regulation in the frontal cortex or hippocampus of experimental rats, as it did in control rats. The lack of the down-regulation effect in response to desipramine treatment in deprived rats may be an alteration of adaptive mechanisms, which may contribute to the behavioral abnormalities attributed to early undernutrition.\r"

  ".W": "Feeding behavior in response to a carbohydrate preload was determined in lean and obese Zucker rats. Rats were adapted to a schedule of feeding during a 12-h daily dark period. Carbohydrate preloads (cornstarch in water) were given by intragastric intubation 30 min before rats had access to a choice of two diets that differed in their protein and carbohydrate contents. Behavioral responses of lean rats to carbohydrate preloads were prompt and selective. In the first hour of feeding, reduction in intake, mainly of the high carbohydrate-low protein diet, more than compensated for the energy content of the preload. In contrast, obese rats failed to achieve a similar degree of compensation to the energy surplus from the carbohydrate preload during the first hour of feeding. Also, their decreases in food intake were nonselective. In general, it took obese rats two or more hours to adjust their feeding behavior in response to a carbohydrate preload. Increasing the size of the preload did not improve the overall response of obese rats, but an extra 30-min lapse between preload and food access led to selective suppression in first-hour intake from the high carbohydrate-low protein diet. These findings suggest that altered food intake and selection behavior of the obese Zucker rat may be, in part, due to a delay in response to physiologic and metabolic changes arising from carbohydrate ingestion.\r"

More vaccine-injured children will probably receive compensation than would have been true under state law, but each child will probably receive less money for damages. Manufacturers will pay excise taxes to fund the compensation scheme and receive, in return, substantial immunity from liability under state law. Although these provisions create incentives that work in opposite directions, producers likely will still have reason to improve the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The situation for those who administer vaccinations is less clear. Freeing them from the threat of litigation would leave them with little incentive to use immunizations appropriately because they do not contribute to the compensation scheme. Although Congress intended to make those who give vaccines immune from state claims, it may have failed to do so, leaving providers with their liability largely unchanged. The most pervasive uncertainty is that the Act is designed to self-destruct and may soon return vaccine-injured children, manufacturers, and providers to the state of the law before Congress acted.\r"

Among 129 families referred to us by area pediatricians, we identified a dominantly inherited hyperlipoproteinemia in 97 of them. Twenty had familial hypercholesterolemia, 65 familial combined hyperlipidemia, 11 hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, and one familial hypertriglyceridemia. As expected, almost half (9/20) of the siblings of probands with familial hypercholesterolemia were affected. Although we expected incomplete gene penetrance in the siblings of the probands with familial combined hyperlipidemia, we found 43 affected and 40 unaffected among the 83 siblings of the 65 probands. Our findings suggest that hyperlipidemia in children, caused by familial combined hyperlipidemia, occurs more than three times as frequently as familial hypercholesterolemia and that in families identified by a child proband, the penetrance is complete. Pediatricians should identify this primary hyperlipidemia in childhood and attempt to prevent the associated risk of premature coronary artery disease by prescribing appropriate diet and life-style modifications.\r"

When the recurrences were adjusted separately for birth order and maternal age, the risk was still five times that expected (p less than 0.001). Families with infant deaths from causes other than sudden infant death syndrome had similar recurrence rates, suggesting that the phenomenon was not specific to sudden infant death syndrome. The overall mortality rate for subsequent siblings after a sudden death event totaled 20.8/1000. We believe that a risk of 2%, although small in the design of studies of infants at risk for sudden infant death syndrome, is not trivial in the counseling of parents.\r"

The overall incidence of sudden infant death syndrome for these groups was 1.1/1000 live births (194 cases). The ethnic-specific incidence was statistically associated with the immigration status of each ethnic group, as measured by the proportion of all live births for which the mother was born in the United States, with a higher incidence for groups that have been in the United States for the longest period. A logistic model was used to examine simultaneously the association of sudden infant death syndrome with maternal ethnicity, ethnic homogeneity or heterogeneity of the parents, and maternal birthplace (United States, or elsewhere). The logistic analysis did not yield statistically significant evidence to support cultural assimilation as a factor in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome for these groups. This finding may be due to small sample size and inadequate indicators of assimilation. It may also be that other factors relating to immigration and selective migration affect the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome among Asian-Americans.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize more fully the immunologic basis for increased susceptibility to infection in patients with low serum concentrations of IgG2, we identified eight infection-prone children, 1 to 2 years of age, with serum IgG2 concentrations greater than 2 SD below the mean for age and followed their serologic and clinical courses for 1 to 3 years. Two of the eight children became clinically and immunologically normal and may have had transient IgG2 deficiency with an exaggerated developmental delay of this late-maturing subclass. The remaining six subjects had persistently subnormal or low-normal serum IgG2 levels and continued to experience frequent infections. All six of these children responded poorly to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) polysaccharide, and four of six responded poorly to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 polysaccharide. Both IgG1 and IgG2-specific antibody responses to these vaccines were abnormal. Three of these six children also responded poorly to tetanus toxoid, an antigen that normally induces a predominant IgG1 response. Although five of these six children produced antibodies in response to Hib polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine, three of four given Hib oligosaccharide CRM conjugate vaccine required booster doses to respond, a pattern of response characteristic of infants less than 6 months of age. Further, although serum concentrations of IgG1 were normal, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four of six children tested produced extremely small amounts of IgG1 and IgG3 as well as IgG2. Finally, varied patterns of abnormalities of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgG4 became apparent in five of the six children with persistently low serum IgG2 values. This study demonstrates that subnormal serum concentrations of IgG2 may be associated with varied patterns of immunologic dysfunction, some of which are evolving and may be responsible for increased susceptibility of these children to infection.\r"

  ".W": "A new pertussis vaccine, composed of purified pertussis toxin inactivated by hydrogen peroxide and adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide (NICHD-Ptxd), was injected into 60 children aged 18 to 23 months without a history of pertussis or pertussis vaccination. Two doses of toxoid, 10 and 50 micrograms, were used. Two injections, given 8 to 12 weeks apart, elicited increases in serum levels of antitoxin and IgG antibodies in 56 children who had no detectable antitoxin (less than 5 units) before vaccination. Four children with detectable antitoxin (greater than or equal to 5 units) before the first vaccination had pronounced antibody increases after the first dose. After the second dose, the geometric mean antitoxin concentration was 29 units with the 50 micrograms dosage and 10 units with the 10 micrograms dosage (p less than 0.001). Serum antibody levels elicited by two injections of 50 micrograms were similar to those in patients convalescing from pertussis. A third injection given to seven children 9 to 10 months after the second injection gave a booster response, with high levels of antitoxin (160 to 1280 units) and of IgG antibodies. With few exceptions the antibody response was restricted to the IgG class. Transient local reactions greater than or equal to 2 cm in diameter occurred in 14% of the children after the first dose and in 44% after the second and third doses. Moderate fever was recorded after 6% of all injections. There were no changes in peripheral blood leukocyte counts or fasting blood glucose levels measured before and 24 hours after the first injection. We conclude that NICHD-Ptxd is immunogenic in children. No serious adverse effects were noted.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of chronic hepatitis B in 27 children who had increased alanine aminotransferase activity and antibody to hepatitis B e antigen in serum from the time of their first clinical observation. Initial histologic changes were consistent with chronic active hepatitis in 13 cases (three with associated cirrhosis) and with persistent or lobular hepatitis in the remaining cases. On the basis of virologic testing, three groups of patients were identified: (1) two children had hepatitis delta antigen in the liver and anti-delta antibody in serum, and both had severe hepatitis; (2) 10 children had hepatitis B virus DNA in serum, and 60% of them had active hepatitis; (3) 15 patients had no hepatitis B virus DNA, and 33% of them had active hepatitis. During a follow-up period of 12 months to 12 years (mean +/- SD: 6.1 +/- 2.4 years), the disease remained active in both children with anti-delta antibody, but they had no major complaints. In all eight patients who could be followed in group 2, test results became negative for hepatitis B virus DNA and alanine aminotransferase activity normalized within 4 years; biochemical remission was delayed in three patients with higher hepatitis B virus DNA levels on entry, and one of these patients had a severe exacerbation of disease activity before remission. In group 3, a total of 10 patients (71%) achieved biochemical remission within 1 year, and two within 26 months; only two patients, who were transfused at birth, had long-lasting liver damage. These results indicate a trend to early remission of liver disease in children with chronic hepatitis B with antibody to hepatitis B e antigen without delta virus infection. Antiviral therapy aimed at accelerating the termination of hepatitis B virus replication may be indicated only in those with higher levels of hepatitis B virus DNA.\r"

Nine stunted children with end-stage renal disease (median age 5.8 years, median bone age 2.7 years) were treated with recombinant human growth hormone, 4 IU/m2/day subcutaneously, for a period of 1 year. Median height velocity was increased from 4.4 cm/yr before therapy to 8.0 cm/yr during treatment. Negative values for height velocity standard deviation scores for chronologic age were improved from a median of -2.6 to +1.5 without advancing bone age more than chronologic age. The growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I resistance may be explained in part by the increased serum concentration of the high molecular weight insulin-like growth factor binding protein despite normal insulin-like growth factor I serum concentration. Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone improved the ratio between the serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I and its binding protein, and normalized the somatomedin bioactivity in the growth cartilage bioassay.\r"

Ages at operation ranged from 1 to 17 years. All patients were followed up with selective coronary arteriography, thallium myocardial imaging, electrocardiography at rest, and the Master \"two-step\" and treadmill exercise tests for coronary insufficiency. Surgical outcome was analyzed by comparing results of patient examinations made preoperatively with those both at 1 month and 1 year postoperatively. One month after the operation, 25 (93%) of 27 internal mammary artery grafts and 6 (86%) of 7 saphenous vein grafts were patent; 1 year after the operation, 19 (86%) of 22 internal mammary artery grafts and 6 (67%) of 9 saphenous vein grafts were patent. By comparing the preoperative findings of myocardial imaging with those obtained 1 month after surgery, we found that 17 (68%) of 25 showed improvement and 3 (12%) of 25 were worse. At 1 year, 6 (29%) of 21 showed further improvement than at 1 month, suggesting increased development of the coronary bed after internal mammary artery graft anastomosis. Thus an internal mammary artery graft has proved to be satisfactory in the management of children with coronary artery obstruction caused by Kawasaki disease; it appears that both the quality of life and the life expectancy of those patients can be improved by the surgery.\r"

  ".W": "We studied bone mineral metabolism prospectively in 113 children with chronic rheumatic diseases (juvenile arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and juvenile dermatomyositis) to determine the relationship of serum levels of osteocalcin to rheumatic disease activity and corticosteroid usage, and to determine, in part, the cause of osteopenia in this population. Disease activity was quantitated by historical, clinical, and serologic means and an activity score derived. The 113 children were divided according to the expression of their disease, which was active (group 1: mean score 3.42, mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/hr) or inactive (group 2: score 1.7, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 15 mm/hr) (p less than 0.02 group 1 vs group 2 for each value), or which remitted during the study (group 3). We found that serum levels of osteocalcin, but not those of ionized calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and parathyroid hormone, were reduced in group 1 children even before corticosteroid therapy was employed. Children in both group 2 and group 3 had normal osteocalcin levels despite the use of corticosteroids. The reduced levels of osteocalcin were predictive of a reduction in bone mass measured by photon absorptiometry in 16 of 19 children so studied. We conclude that skeletal abnormalities that result in a reduced bone mass occur in the clinical course of the majority of children with active chronic rheumatic diseases, are associated with reduced osteocalcin levels, and are not related to the use of corticosteroids. Serum osteocalcin levels may be a sensitive marker for reduced osteoblast activity and bone formation in children with chronic rheumatic diseases.\r"

Eight were found to have abnormal karyotypes in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, or both. No single clinical feature was predictive of chromosome imbalance in this group of patients. Cytogenetic findings included a balanced de novo X-autosome translocation; ring 10; 45,X/46,X,+ring; mosaic del 13q11 (fibroblasts); mosaic triploidy (fibroblasts); mosaic tetrasomy 12p (fibroblasts); mosaic apparently balanced 15;22 translocation (peripheral blood); and mosaic trisomy 18 (peripheral blood). Hypomelanosis of Ito is characterized by swirly hypopigmentation or depigmentation of the skin with or without other malformations. Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked dominant inheritance have been suggested but not confirmed. Chromosomal aneuploidy has also been reported. We believe that hypomelanosis of Ito is an etiologically heterogeneous physical finding, and recommend karyotyping of multiple tissues of all patients with abnormal cutaneous pigmentation associated with developmental delay or structural malformations.\r"

In infants without any intracranial hemorrhage or parenting risk factors, severe chronic lung disease was not related to neurologic or cognitive outcome. Infants with increasing grades of intracranial hemorrhage had increasing rates of neurologic and cognitive abnormalities. However, the factor associated with the highest incidence of later abnormality was the parenting risk factor. We conclude that infants with medical risk factors may have additional social risk factors, and that both of these influences must be considered in an examination of the long-term sequelae of neonatal complications.\r"

Severity of illness was assigned by means of the \"pediatric risk of mortality\" (PRISM) score. The children's ages ranged from 9 to 84 months. Central nervous system effects were noted in 44 patients; bradycardia occurred in 25, and apnea or depressed respiration was seen in 18. Thirty-four patients had symptoms within 1 hour of presentation, but no patient had further clinical deterioration more than 4 hours after presentation. Six patients required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. There was no difference in PRISM score or duration of symptoms between those patients who received naloxone and those who did not. More patients receiving naloxone required intubation, and only three patients had definite improvement after naloxone administration. We conclude that (1) young children who ingest clonidine have a wide spectrum of serious findings, (2) delayed progression of symptoms after clonidine poisoning is unlikely in a young child with normal renal function, and (3) naloxone is an inconsistent antidote for clonidine poisoning.\r"

  ".U": "90204256\r", 
  ".W": "It is now well established that compounds classified as kappa opioids can, in circumstances where they produce no measurable agonist effects, antagonize the actions of mu opioids. Largely on the basis of studies in vitro, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA) has been classified as a reversible kappa agonist and long acting mu antagonist. The present study investigated the possibility that the mu antagonist profile of this compound could be related to its kappa agonist actions. We used two tests of analgesia (the acetic acid writhing test and the hot-water tail-flick test) and selective kappa agonists and antagonists given at supraspinal and spinal sites in mice. Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of beta-FNA, but not the selective kappa agonist U50,488H, produced long-lasting and dose-related analgesia in the writhing test for periods up to 48 hr after a single dose. In contrast, i.t. beta-FNA had no agonist actions in the tail-flick test. The kappa antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) produced no agonist effects in either analgesic test when given i.t. In the writhing test, nor-BNI produced a rightward displacement of the beta-FNA dose-response line regardless of whether beta-FNA was given 10 min or 4 hr before testing, indicating that i.t. beta-FNA was acting as a kappa agonist in this test. As both i.t. morphine and beta-FNA are active in the writhing test, the antagonist actions of i.t. beta-FNA could be evaluated only in the tail-flick test. beta-FNA, but not nor-BNI, blocked the effects of i.t. morphine in the tail-flick test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Effects of chronic ethanol exposure on adenylate cyclase activity and intracellular cyclic AMP content were investigated in PC 12 cells. Stimulation of cyclic AMP content by 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO) and forskolin were reduced after a 4-day exposure of the cells to 150 mM ethanol. Although chronic ethanol treatment did not alter 2-CADO- and NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities in a cell-free preparation, 2-CADO-, forskolin, and NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were reduced when assays were carried out in saponin-treated cells. Chronic ethanol exposure also increased the ability of in vitro ethanol to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity and cyclic AMP content. The in vitro addition of tert-butanol caused a dose-dependent increase in adenylate cyclase activity, and a 4-day treatment of PC 12 cells with 50 mM tert-butanol reduced 2-CADO- and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP contents. Chronic treatment with tert-butanol, however, did not alter the stimulatory effects of in vitro ethanol. Similarly, a 4-day exposure to 125 mM ethanol using serum-free defined media decreased 2-CADO- and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP content without changing the stimulatory effects of in vitro ethanol. The increased sensitivity of adenylate cyclase to in vitro ethanol also was not observed when chronic ethanol treatment was carried out with media containing delipidated serum. The increased sensitivity to ethanol, however, was restored when the chronic ethanol treatment was carried out with serum-free defined media supplemented with serum lipoproteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PAF, identified as 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine, is a biologically active ether phospholipid produced by various cells types. PAF also activates a variety of inflammatory cells including the cells which produce PAF. Ethanol at 20 to 100 mM inhibited phagocytosis of unopsonized zymosan and concomitantly decreased PAF concentration in the stimulated macrophages. In contrast, in cells not stimulated with zymosan, ethanol increased the recoverable PAF. Ethanol, at 100 mM, inhibited the uptake of exogenous PAF but did not alter the distribution of PAF metabolites in the clonal macrophage cell line. The effect ethanol has on PAF synthesis appears dependent on the activation state of the cell. Two situations were identified in this study: 1) one linked to phagocytosis or cell stimulation which is inhibited by ethanol, and 2) PAF synthesis which is not dependent on overt cell activation that is enhanced by ethanol.\r"

Tension was developed in isolated segments of ileum using transmural electrical stimulation of enteric cholingeric nerves. The ability of isoproterenol to relax the ileum, via beta-1 adrenoceptor and atypical beta adrenoceptor agonism, was measured. Propranolol (5 x 10(-6) M) and bromoacetylaprenololmetane blocked beta-1 adrenoceptors but, at the concentrations tested, were without affinity at atypical beta adrenoceptors. (-)-Alprenolol and (-)-dihydroalprenolol, however, acted as competitive antagonists at both sites (pA2 values of 8.2 and 8.81 at beta-1 adrenoceptors and 6.47 and 6.43 at atypical beta adrenoceptors, respectively). (-)-Alprenolol also exerted agonistic activity at the atypical beta adrenoceptor. [3H](-)-Dihydroproalprenolol failed to identify beta-1 adrenoceptors or atypical beta adrenoceptors but, instead, bound to a putative lipophilic site unrelated to ileal adrenoceptors. Before this study, nadolol (pA2 = 4.7) was the only documented antagonist at the atypical beta adrenoceptor in guinea pig ileum. Thus, the present results detail two additional pharmacological probes which exhibit about a 100-fold greater affinity than nadolol for the atypical site.\r"

  ".W": "Metoprolol is considered to be a class II antiarrhythmic agent that is highly specific for cardiac beta-1 adrenergic receptors, yet long-term administration can produce prolongation of the rate-corrected Q-T interval in humans. Action potentials and sodium (INa), \"L\"-type calcium (ICa) and transient outward (Ito) or inward rectifying potassium (IKl) currents were recorded from isolated cat ventricular myocytes using the whole-cell-patch technique to determine if metoprolol can directly affect cellular electrophysiological activity. External and pipette solutions, holding potentials and voltage-clamp protocols appropriate to isolate and examine INa, IKl, Ito and ICa were used. Metoprolol reversibly decreased both the duration and voltage of the action potential plateau but had no effect on upstroke velocity, the repolarization rate during phase 3 or the resting potential. Confirming previous reports suggesting that metoprolol appears to have little or no local anesthetic activity, INa was not affected by metoprolol at concentrations up to 100 microM during voltage-clamp pulses applied at less than 1 Hz when holding potential was negative to -110 mV. However, when trains of pulses to -10 mV from a holding potential of -110 mV were applied at 1 to 5 Hz, use-dependent inhibition of INa occurred, suggesting that 100 microM metoprolol may interact with inactivated Na channels to inhibit INa. Metoprolol (10 and 100 microM) also caused a concentration-dependent decrease in peak inward IKl elicited in response to hyperpolarizing from -40 mV to potentials negative to the IKl reversal potential. In addition, during strong hyperpolarizations (i.e., less than or equal to -150 mV) an inward (i.e., downward) droop in current was observed during the inactivation phase approximately 20 to 30 msec after pulse onset. Metoprolol (10 microM) also reduced peak Ito and ICa without altering the time courses of inactivation of either current or the level of the steady-state outward current elicited positive to -40 mV; steady-state ICa, on the other hand, was reduced. The sensitivity to block by metoprolol was: IKl greater than ICa greater than or equal to Ito greater than INa.\r"

The response to 50 mM KCl was similar in both preparations, averaging 59.3 +/- 2.5 mN/mm2 (n = 28). In the absence of any treatment, de-endothelialized rings (-E) spontaneously contracted; i.e., a basal tone of 21.8 +/- 2.0% of the control 50 mM KCl contraction was measured against the base line after an N2-induced relaxation. Intact rings (+E) developed a basal tone of only 1.8 +/- 0.7% (n = 14). Upon decreasing PO2 in the bath from 95 to 20%, (approximately 665-140 Torr) -E showed a 12.9 +/- 2.8% increase in force compared with only 1.5 +/- 0.6% for +E (n = 10). Norepinephrine also preferentially constricted the -E rings (1 x 10(-6) M: -E = 13.6 +/- 2.0%, +E = 0.6 +/- 0.3%; 3 x -6 M: -E = 21.7 +/- 3.1%, +E = 3.3 +/- 1.1%, n = 8). A similar increase in sensitivity of the -E compared with the +E ring was observed for methoxamine, a nonmetabolized, alpha-1-selective agonist, KCl, Bay K 8644 and histamine, suggesting that the level of tone and not the endothelium per se underlies the changes in sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, the vasoconstrictive effects of decreasing PO2 and norepinephrine were also studied with tone altered by 10 mM KCl which increased the tone in both -E and +E.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Particular attention was focused on the endothelium because it is known that endothelial cells have a high concentration of ATP and its metabolites. Segments of rabbit thoracic aorta, some denuded of endothelial cells by rubbing the lumen of the vessel, were incubated in organ baths and subjected to transmural nerve stimulation or stimulated with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. A portion of the bathing solution was processed for the determination of norepinephrine by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and a portion for determination of ATP, ADP, AMP and adenosine by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Transmural stimulation led to a significant release of both norepinephrine and the adenine nucleosides and nucleotides in a ratio of 1 to 350. Removal of the endothelium did not change the release of norepinephrine but reduced the release of adenosine and its derivatives by 90%. Methoxamine also caused the release of adenosine and the adenine nucleotides which was reduced by 93% by removal of the endothelium. Thus, the endothelium seems to be a major source of transmural nerve stimulation and alpha-agonist induced overflow of adenosine and adenine nucleotides. The endothelium is not the exclusive source of these purine congeners, however. In the case of transmural stimulation there is approximately 10% of the total which is independent of the endothelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which activators of protein kinase C (PKC) stimulate contractile responses in arterial smooth muscle is not known. In this study, we assessed the relative contribution of CA(++)-dependent and independent pathways in mediating phorbol ester-induced 20 kdalton myosin light chain (MLC)-phosphorylation and force in medial smooth muscle strips from swine carotid artery. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB; 10(-7)M)-stimulated stress development was associated with a significant increase in the fraction of phosphorylated MLC, from 0.08 +/- 0.02 to 0.24 +/- 0.02 after 30 min of stimulation. Under conditions of Ca++ depletion, which normally do not support Ca++/calmodulin-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) by physiological stimuli, PDB-induced contractile responses were reduced significantly. However, after Ca2++ depletion, PDB (10(-6) M; 30 min) still caused an increase in MLC-phosphorylation from 0.10 +/- 0.02 at rest to 0.19 +/- 0.03. Preincubation with nifedipine (10(-7) M) had no significant effect on contractile responses to PDB, indicating that Ca++ influx through nifedipine-sensitive voltage channels did not contribute significantly to the observed Ca++ dependency of the PDB responses. Staurosporine (0.1-0.3 microM), a putative PKC inhibitor, significantly inhibited PDB-induced contractile and MLC phosphorylation responses. Tonic histamine (3 microM)- and KCl-induced contractile and MLC-phosphorylation responses were inhibited by the same concentrations of staurosporine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The studies in this report were carried out to investigate the effects of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) on cardiac membrane adenylate cyclase activity and to determine the role of changes in membrane lipid order in these effects. delta 9-THC and its psychoactive metabolite, 11-OH-delta 9-THC, increased isoproterenol (ISO) stimulation of adenylate cyclase in rat cardiac ventricular membranes. Cannabidiol, cannabinol and (+)-delta 9-THC were all without effect, indicating that this effect of delta 9-THC is stereoselective and specific for cannabinoids with psychoactive potency. delta 9-THC also increased glucagon stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The enhancement of both ISO and glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase was due to an increase in the Vmax of these agonists with no significant change in Kact. delta 9-THC did not affect basal adenylate cyclase activity or the activation of the enzyme by forskolin, guanine nucleotides or fluoride ion. Those cannabinoids which increased ISO-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity also decreased the break temperature of the Arrhenius plot; evidence that the effects of delta 9-THC involve changes in membrane phospholipid order. The effects of the cannabinoids on cardiac membrane phospholipid order were investigated directly using diphenylhexatriene fluorescence polarization. delta 9-THC and 11-OH-delta 9-THC alone decreased the break temperature of the diphenylhexatriene temperature profile, i.e., decreased the temperature of the lipid phase separation. This effect of delta 9-THC was stereoselective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Affinities for 5-HT and for ketanserin against 5-HT-elicited contractions in both vascular tissues suggested the presence of homogeneous 5-HT2 receptors with values consistent with other reported 5-HT2 receptor preparations. However, further studies showed compounds which exhibited either partial agonism in the RFA and competitive antagonism of 5-HT in the RA, or antagonism of 5-HT in both arteries with different affinities. Affinity constants calculated from the isolated vascular tissue studies were compared with affinity constants calculated for inhibition of [3H]ketanserin binding in the frontal cortices of both the rat and the rabbit. There were no significant differences between the pKi values in the rat and the rabbit cortical membranes or between these pKi's in either species and the pA2 values in the RA. Several of the affinities for both the partial agonists and the antagonists in the RFA were significantly different from the binding pKi and the pA2 values in the RA. These findings suggest identity between the [3H]ketanserin binding site in the cortices of both species and the 5-HT2 receptor in the RA; however, the contractile 5-HT receptor in the RFA, although showing some characteristics of a 5-HT2 receptor, is significantly different. We suggest that there may be functional subtypes of the vascular 5-HT receptor.\r"

From a structural series with anticipated antihistamine activity, Sch 37370 (1-acetyl-4(8-chloro-5,6-dihydro-11H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[1,2- b]pyridine-11-ylidine)piperidine) has been identified as a dual antagonist of PAF and histamine in vitro and in vivo and has been compared with several selective antagonists of PAF and histamine. Sch 37370 selectively inhibits PAF-induced aggregation of human platelets (IC50 = 0.6 microM) and also competes with PAF binding to specific sites in membrane preparations from human lungs (IC50 = 1.2 microM). Sch 37370 blocks the binding of [3H]pyrilamine to histamine-H1 receptors in rat brain membranes. Administered i.v. to guinea pigs, Sch 37370 is an equipotent antagonist of PAF and histamine-induced bronchospasm (ED50 = 0.6-0.7 mg/kg). Orally in guinea pigs, Sch 37370 is somewhat more effective against bronchospasms to histamine (ED50 = 2.4 mg/kg) than against PAF (ED50 = 4.1-6.0 mg/kg) or serotonin (ED50 = 9.6 mg/kg). Sch 37370 only weakly antagonizes methacholine-induced bronchospasm (ED50 = 51 mg/kg) and is completely inactive at 50 mg/kg against leukotriene C4 or substance P. Sch 37370 blocks hypotension in rats and a cutaneous reaction in monkeys induced by either PAF or histamine, as well as PAF-induced lethality in mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An attenuated response to loop diuretics is a frequent observation in the nephrotic syndrome. To determine if the presence of albumin in renal tubular fluid attenuates diuretic response in normal rats, in vivo loop segment microperfusion was performed in normal rats at 20 nl/min with perfusates containing 6.0 microM furosemide in the presence and absence of 3.8 microM albumin. Compared to loop segments perfused without diuretic (control), furosemide reduced (P less than .001) fractional chloride uptake from 56 +/- 2 to 34 +/- 2%. After addition of albumin to furosemide perfusate, fractional loop chloride reabsorption was 45 +/- 1%; a value greater (P less than .01) than that observed in furosemide perfused loop segments, but less (P less than .05) than that observed in control loop segments. Albumin added to perfusate in the absence of furosemide had no effect on fractional loop segment chloride uptake. Addition of 1.7 microM immunoglobulin G to furosemide perfusate failed to attenuate furosemide response. Absolute loop segment chloride reabsorption demonstrated a similar pattern. Tubule fluid perfusion rates determined in vivo and loop segment fluid reabsorption were equivalent in all groups. Thus, albumin in renal tubule fluid attenuates the effect of furosemide on loop segment chloride reabsorption in the rat. This blunted response presumably occurs because of a reduction in the amount of pharmacologically active drug due to albumin-furosemide binding. Consequently, albumin-furosemide binding in the renal tubule may contribute to the diuretic resistance in nephrotic syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The inhibitory effects of Ca channel antagonists on gastric acid secretion [[14C]-aminopyrine (AP) uptake ratio] have been analyzed in isolated rabbit parletal cells (PC). Secretagogue-stimulated AP uptake was inhibited by verapamil and diltiazem in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 15 and 100 microM, respectively, both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca. In contrast, nifedipine had no effect on AP accumulation. Verapamil decreased histamine-stimulated respiration with the same IC50 as observed for AP uptake. Imidazole, a weak base, by buffering the acid spaces in PC, reversed the inhibitory effect of verapamil on respiration. In the bullfrog gastric mucosa, forskolin-stimulated proton transport was inhibited by verapamil (10(-4) M) from the luminal but not the serosal side. This inhibitory effect was reversed by either elevating KCl concentration in, or removing the drug from, the secretory solution. Verapamil inhibited gastric microsomal H+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (H+,K(+)-ATPase) and PC K(+)-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activities with a higher potency than diltiazem. Inhibition of these enzymes by verapamil and diltiazem was pH dependent. The drugs competed with K+ in both H+,K(+)-ATPase and K(+)-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase reactions. Our data suggest that inhibition of the gastric proton pump by verapamil or diltiazem is not due to their Ca channel antagonism but to their interaction with the luminal high affinity K(+)-site of the H+,K(+)-ATPase under acidic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized the in vitro binding of a new ligand, [125I]epidepride, and used this substituted benzamide to assess the sensitivity of dopamine D-2 receptors to sodium. Both direct and indirect binding studies with [125I]epidepride and unlabeled epidepride, respectively, demonstrated that the affinity of D-2 receptors for the ligand was decreased from 20 to 30 pM in the presence of sodium to 350 to 500 pM in the absence of sodium. The density of binding sites for [125I]epidepride was identical in the presence and absence of NaCl. The time courses for association of [125I]epidepride to and dissociation from D-2 receptors in the presence of sodium were not consistent with simple bimolecular reactions, suggesting the possibility of a sodium-dependent ligand-induced receptor isomerization. Thus, dissociation of [125I]epidepride was biphasic in the presence of sodium, but monophasic in the absence of sodium. The rank order of potency for inhibition of [125I]epidepride binding by drugs was identical in rat striatum and cells expressing a D-2 receptor cDNA, and similar to the previously described pharmacological profile of D-2 receptors labeled by [3H]spiperone. [125I]Epidepride bound to two classes of binding sites in rat medial prefrontal cortex. One class, present at a density of 10 fmol/mg of protein and with a Kd value of approximately 40 pM, was pharmacologically indistinguishable from D-2 receptors in striatum and transfected cells. The pharmacological profile of the second class of sites was similar to that of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. [125I]Epidepride had 50- to 100-fold lower affinity (approximately 2 nM) for alpha-2 receptors than for D-2 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma concentrations of radioactivity 1 hr after dosing were higher in monkeys than in rats. The biphasic elimination of radioactivity in rats was characterized by half-lives (T1/2) of 10 and 143 hr, whereas the elimination of radioactivity in monkeys was characterized by T1/2 values of 11 and 66 hr. Plasma total antibody and radioactivity concentrations were similar within 6 (rat) and 24 (monkey) hr after dosing; however, total antibody concentrations were greater than radioactivity concentrations thereafter, indicating the presence of free antibody in the plasma. Plasma elimination T1/2 values and areas under the curve of total antibody in rats and monkeys were greater than those of radioactivity. The presence of free antibody implies the presence of free DAVLB-hyd; however, plasma concentrations of free DAVLB-hyd were at least 3 orders of magnitude less than those of radioactivity in both species. The T1/2 of free DAVLB-hyd in plasma of LY203725 dosed monkeys was 16 hr. Hydrolysis of the conjugate to yield free DAVLB-hyd was observed upon incubation of conjugate with rat plasma in vitro. Administration of DAVLB-hyd to rats resulted in a rapid initial decrease in plasma DAVLB-hyd followed by a slower (T1/2 = 1.4 hr) elimination rate. Fecal excretion was the predominant mode of elimination of radioactivity in both rats and monkeys dosed with [3H]LY203725.\r"

The present investigations describe the actions of a recently introduced A2 selective adenosine agonist, CGS 21680 (2-[p-(carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosi ne), on various functional neural responses known to be affected by adenosine. In hippocampal slices, CGS 21680 appeared to be a weak agonist on pre- and postsynaptic measures of electrophysiological activity (putative A1 receptor mediated events) and was ineffective at stimulating the formation of cAMP (a putative A2b mediated response). 5'-N-ethycarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), which is known to act at both A2a and A2b receptors, increased hippocampal cAMP levels 4-fold. In striatal slices, CGS 21680 potently stimulated the formation of cAMP with an EC50 of 110 nM but was ineffective at inhibiting electrically stimulated dopamine release. In contrast, adenosine and cyclohexyladenosine both inhibited the stimulus-evoked overflow of dopamine. These results agree with previous receptor binding studies suggesting that CGS 21680 is a relatively selective agonist at the high affinity adenosine A2a receptor in striatum, with little intrinsic activity at the low affinity A2b site in hippocampus.\r"

Two types of calcium channel currents (type I and type II) as carried by barium ions were recorded separately on the basis of their different voltage- and time-dependent kinetics. Chlorpromazine reversibly reduced the amplitude of both types of calcium channel currents. The concentration dependence of the calcium channel block indicated a one-to-one binding stoichiometry for both type I and type II currents, with an apparent dissociation constant of 15 microM in both cases. The block of calcium channels was dependent on the holding potential for both type I and type II currents, being enhanced by depolarization. This voltage dependence of the block was due to a higher affinity of chlorpromazine for the inactivated state of the calcium channels than the resting state, as demonstrated by a hyperpolarizing shift of the steady-state inactivation curve. The activation kinetics were not affected by chlorpromazine in either type I or type II current. The time course of inactivation of the type I current was not changed by chlorpromazine, whereas that of the type II current was accelerated, suggesting an involvement of an open channel block. Chlorpromazine block of type I current was independent of the level of test depolarizing pulse, whereas that of type II current was augmented with an increase in depolarization. It was concluded that chlorpromazine binds preferentially to the inactivated form of both type I and type II calcium channels, without affecting the gating kinetics of channel activation.\r"

Because the activation state of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases may be a more sensitive measure of functionally important changes in cyclic nucleotide levels, we examined the ability of several pharmacological agents and electrical stimulation of the enteric neurons to activate cAMP dependent-protein kinase (cA-PK) and to relax isolated strips of LES smooth muscle. Addition of either isoproterenol or SK&F 94120, a selective inhibitor of the low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase to isolated strips of canine LES produced concentration-dependent increases in the activity ratio of cA-PK and concentration-dependent relaxations of canine LES. In contrast, although both zaprinast (M&B 22948), a selective inhibitor of the cyclic GMP selective phosphodiesterase, and sodium nitroprusside relaxed canine LES neither drug significantly increased the activity ratio of cA-PK. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of the enteric neurons produced a frequency-dependent relaxation but did not significantly activate cA-PK. To eliminate the possibility that the rapid metabolism of cAMP prevented us from observing a significant activation of cA-PK during electrical field stimulation, the ability of electrical field stimulation (1.0 Hz) to activate cA-PK was examined in the presence of 0.1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. At at concentration of 0.1 mM, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, by itself, significantly increased the activity ratio of cA-PK; however, there was no additional activation produced by electrical field stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity of rabbit isolated superior mesenteric artery to Ca++ antagonists was examined under various conditions. Relaxation dose-response curves for D600 or nifedipine were generated, and IC50 values were calculated. In the first series of experiments, D600 or nifedipine IC50 was found to be 20-25-fold greater for norepinephrine (NE, 5 microM) contraction than for 80 nM K+ contraction. Even when the tissues were depolarized with 80 mM K+ before NE contraction, D600 or nifedipine IC50 still remained significantly greater compared with 80 mM K+ alone and remained closer to that during NE alone. Also a protocol was designed to study NE-induced phasic contraction in EGTA-physiological salt solution (a functional indicator of intracellular Ca++ release) as well as NE-induced sustained contraction after readdition of Ca++. The effects of varying [K+]ex (0-80 nM range) on NE-induced [Ca++]i release as well as on the D600 IC50 for NE contraction was studied. Increasing [K+]ex was found to enhance NE-sensitive [Ca++]i release and lower the D600 IC50 for NE contraction. Thus, conditions causing an increase in the ability of NE to cause [Ca++]i release were associated with an increase in the sensitivity of NE contraction to D600. These data provide functional evidence that the receptor-agonist sensitive Ca++ influx process in vascular smooth muscle is not solely regulated by changes in membrane potential. Additional mechanisms, such as a modulatory role of [Ca++]i release, in this process are implicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Higher doses slightly increased ratings of adverse effects in the 1st week (4 mg greater than 2 mg greater than 0.5 mg greater than 0 mg). Over the next 6 months, the two higher doses appeared to support more gum self-administration than the two lower doses (4 mg = 2 mg greater than 0.5 mg = 0 mg) in the subsample of long-term quitters (n = 20). Our results suggest the dose-response curves differ for nicotine gum's reinforcing, withdrawal-suppression and self-reported effects.\r"

Unilateral sympathectomy was performed from T12 to L9 in adult female dogs. After 3 to 5 weeks, the denervated saphenous veins were removed. Innervated saphenous veins were obtained from unoperated dogs. In innervated but not in denervated veins, electrical stimulation generated excitatory junction potentials and a slow depolarization. The slow depolarization was inhibited by rauwolscine or phentolamine, but not by prazosin, whereas excitatory junction potentials were not inhibited by alpha adrenergic blockers. Exogenously applied norepinephrine caused a depolarization of the membrane that was inhibited by rauwolscine but not by prazosin. The selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, and the selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, UK 14,304, caused depolarization. In denervated veins, the threshold concentrations of norepinephrine or UK 14,304 required to depolarize the smooth muscle cell membrane were reduced. Responses to phenylephrine were not affected by denervation. These results indicate that in the canine saphenous vein norepinephrine, whether added exogenously or released from sympathetic nerves, causes predominant depolarization by activating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Denervation augments selectively the electrical response to alpha-2 adrenergic stimulation.\r"

Inhibitors were presented to the livers at a dose of 100 micrograms. The hepatic clearance of lisinopril was very low (0.072 ml/min) and was hardly excreted into the bile. The clearances of enalapril, perindopril and ramipril were higher at 0.63, 0.87 and 9.9 ml/min, respectively, and were excreted into bile. The amounts of ester prodrugs excreted in bile were 4.0, 6.1 and 14%, respectively, whereas the diacid forms were excreted to the extent of 46, 27 and 71% of the administered dose, respectively, over 4 hr. Glucuronide metabolites were only detected in bile in significant concentrations for perindopril and ramipril. Base hydrolysis of the perfusate samples showed that lisinopril was not significantly metabolized to conjugates and that little metabolism of enalapril occurred other than rapid conversion to the diacid form. However, both perindopril and ramipril were extensively metabolized beyond the diacid form. These differences in hepatic handling can in part be explained by their octanol-buffer partition coefficients but may also be related to the introduction of a bicyclic ring in perindopril and ramipril which increases their ability to be metabolized and excreted into bile. These differences in hepatic handling of angiotensin-converting enzyme are likely to influence their clinical usefulness, particularly in renal and hepatic disease.\r"

The maximal binding capacity was 215 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein. Saturation of [3H]PAF binding was obtained with 0.3 nM ligand, and its isotherm was compatible with a single class of binding sites. The stereoselectivity for [3H]PAF was clearly indicated by the low displacing potency of enantio-PAF-C16 (the synthetic enantiomer of PAF) that was 5000-fold less potent than PAF. Specific [3H]PAF binding attained 65% with 0.1 nM ligand and was displaced fully not only by cold PAF but also by RP 59227 (Ki = 6.2 +/- 1.3 nM, n = 7), a novel, potent and specific PAF receptor antagonist in a pure enantiomeric form and several other antagonists such as CV-6209, WEB 2086, L-652,731 and BN 52021. Various classical pharmacological agents did not interfere with the [3H]PAF binding. In intact platelets, [3H]PAF binding shared the same properties as those just described for membrane preparations. A functional role for these binding sites was suggested by the high correlation (r = 0.94, P less than .001) between the Ki values for several known PAF antagonists determined in [3H]PAF binding and the IC50 values obtained against PAF-induced aggregation in whole platelets. Thus, the present [3H]PAF binding in human platelet membranes may be a useful pharmacological tool to study possible changes in [3H]PAF binding parameters induced by pathological states for which PAF may be directly or indirectly responsible.\r"

Under normal conditions, the stomach secreted alkali at the rate of approximately 1 microEq/15 min in the presence of omeprazole (60 mg/kg i.p.) and responded to mucosal acidification (1000 mM HCI for 10 min) by a significant rise of output (approximately 2.5 microEq/15 min), and the latter process was significantly blocked by indomethacin (5 mg/kg s.c.), quinacrine (100 mg/kg s.c.) and vasopressin (10 unit/kg/hr i.v.). Restraint alone decreased basal rates of HCO3- secretion but had no effect on acid-induced HCO3- output. Additional water-immersion stress further reduced alkaline secretion, totally abolished the increased HCO3- response to acid and significantly suppressed the increase of HCO3- output caused by 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (3-30 micrograms/kg s.c.). During restraint stress mucosal blood flow was reduced only by 30% but after exposure to additional water-immersion, it further decreased to about 25% of normal values. Both indomethacin and quinacrine had no effect on mucosal blood flow, whereas vasopressin markedly reduced mucosal blood flow by about 80%. These results suggest that stress not only reduced basal rates of alkaline secretion in the stomach but also impaired the mucosal ability to increase HCO3- output in response to acid. These secretory disorders caused by stress may be attributed to both a decrease of mucosal blood flow and prostaglandin deficiency in the mucosa.\r"

In the present study, we have characterized the receptor selectivity of E-2078 in mu-, delta- and kappa-representative binding assays, and have evaluated the analgesic effect of systemically administered E-2078 by the tail pinch, tail flick and formalin tests in mice. E-2078 possessed a higher affinity for kappa-receptors than for mu- or delta-receptors in the receptor-binding assay. Dose-related, long-lasting analgesia was produced by s.c. injection of E-2078, and its peak effect was observed 2 hr after s.c. administration in all the analgesic tests. This analgesic effect was produced at doses that did not affect rotarod latency. Post-treatment with naloxone dose-dependently reversed the analgesic effects of both E-2078 and morphine, but E-2078-induced analgesia was relatively resistant to naloxone antagonism. Pre-treatment with the kappa-antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine, antagonized the analgesic effect of E-2078 but had little effect on the analgesic action of morphine. These data indicate that E-2078 is a systemically active analgesic and suggest that the activation of kappa-opioid receptors contributes to analgesia.\r"

The hypothesis was tested that this selectivity is due largely to a carrier-mediated transport followed by an intracellular conversion of the prodrug to the active drug, in contrast to another mechanism. The transport of AGSM and GSM was studied with the use of kidney slices. AGSM accumulated in the slices. At 75 microM substrate concentration, the slice to medium ratio was 2.5 +/- 0.2. This accumulation was inhibited by the anion transport inhibitor probenecid (82% inhibition at 1.0 mM) and by the gamma-glutamyl transport inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (60% at 1.0 mM). Acivicin, L-(alpha S,5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid did not inhibit AGSM accumulation at 0.1 mM, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; at 1.0 mM, however, AGSM accumulation was inhibited by 44%. These results suggest that the accumulation of AGSM is caused by an active transport process. GSM did not accumulate in the slices, but was completely converted to sulfamethoxazole (SM) after a 90-min incubation. Accumulation of AGSM was also seen in vivo: at 20 min after AGSM administration (10 mg.kg-1) the plasma, kidney and liver concentrations were 73 +/- 6, 110 +/- 7 and 37 +/- 5 micrograms.g-1, respectively.

By using the distinct biphasic response, the nature of the transmitter systems activated by Formalin in the spinal cord was studied for the purpose of determining the difference of the role of substance P (SP) and somatostatin (SST). The injection of (D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9)SP, (D-Arg1, D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9, Leu11)SP and SP antiserum inhibited only the first phase response. The i.t. injection of -Aminoheptanoyl-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-(OBz)-Thr- (an SST antagonist), SST antiserum and cysteamine (an SST depletor) inhibited only the second phase. This result indicates that SP is involved in the transmission of the first phase, and SST is involved in the transmission of the second phase of the Formalin-induced nociceptive response. With regard to other nociceptive stimuli, two i.t. SP antagonists produced a significant analgesia in the hot plate and tail pinch tests but had no effect in the acetic acid writhing test. However, i.t. SST antagonist and cysteamine produced a significant analgesia in the writhing test but had no effect in the hot plate and tail pinch test. These results suggest that SP participates in the transient pain induced by such acute stimuli as hot plate, tail pinch and the first phase of Formalin response and that SST participates in the prolonged and inflammatory pain induced by stimuli such as acetic acid and the second phase response.\r"

Administered i.p. in rats, these compounds penetrated the blood-brain barrier rapidly and appeared in the cerebrospinal fluid. When administered i.c.v., they induced convulsions with short onset latencies, suggesting that these compounds themselves have convulsant activities. In in vitro experiments using the whole cell clamp method, they suppressed gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced Cl- current isolated on the dissociated mouse sensory neurons in dose-dependent manners through their actions as antagonists at GABAA receptors. The relative potency of the suppressive effects on GABA-induced Cl- current was compatible with that of the convulsant activities in mice. Furthermore, Ro15-1788 did not affect their convulsant activities. These results suggested that the amino-gamma-carbolines induced convulsions through their actions as antagonists at GABAA receptors and not through their actions as inverse agonists or antagonists at benzodiazepine receptors.

Nonetheless, the responsiveness of the PCA and BCA preparations differed markedly in terms of 1) their sensitivity to indomethacin and dexamethasone (indomethacin and dexamethasone abrogated the PCA but not the BCA response), 2) their desensitization properties (the BCA rapidly desensitized, whereas the PCA did not) and 3) the order of potencies for EGF-URO and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) (in the PCA, EGF-URO was more potent than TGF-alpha, whereas in the BCA, the potency of TGF-alpha was greater than or equal to that of EGF-URO). Taken together our data document the presence of two distinct receptor signaling systems for EGF-URO in the PCA and BCA preparations, and our results support the hypothesis that distinct receptor subtypes for EGF-URO may be present in these two tissues.\r"

In this study, mechanisms related to the inhibition of acid formation by AG-1749 were investigated in isolated canine parietal cells. AG-1749 suppressed the acid formation stimulated by histamine, carbachol or dibutyryl cyclic AMP with IC50 values of approximately 0.09 microM: AG-1749 being twice as potent as omeprazole. The inhibitory effect of AG-1749 was antagonized by dithiothreitol (1 mM). 2-Cyclo-hexen-1-one (3 mM) decreased cytosolic glutathione to less than 10% of control value, and caused a 3-fold increase in the inhibitory effect of AG-1749. Glutathione, however, when added exogenously, did not affect the action of AG-1749. The inhibition was reversed by removing AG-1749 from the medium or by adding dithiothreitol (1 mM). The reversal of inhibition by these two procedures was hardly affected by puromycin (100 microM) or cycloheximide (300 microM) but significantly prevented by 2-cyclo-hexen-1-one (1 mM). Exogenously added AG-2000 (10 microM) or AG-1812 (5 microM), active forms of AG-1749, did not inhibit acid formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PGE1-stimulated release was dependent on extracellular calcium and sensitive to dihydropyridine calcium channel agonists and antagonists at 1 microM, but unlike release stimulated by 50 mM extracellular potassium was not sensitive to verapamil or diltiazem at 10 microM. The PGs also enhanced the turnover of inositol phospholipids, but the PGE1-stimulated formation of inositol phosphates was small compared to that produced by bradykinin, which stimulates a similar degree of release. Unlike release, the stimulation of inositol phosphate formation by PGs was not dependent on the addition of calcium to the medium. In down-regulation experiments, involving 2 hr preincubation with 30 microM PGE1, release in response to the three PGs was attenuated, whereas the release response to bradykinin and nicotine was unaffected. However, the stimulation of (poly)phosphoinositide turnover by PG was not down-regulated by prior exposure to PGE1. This dissociation of the inositol phosphate response suggests that release in response to PGs is not downstream of stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. A further series of experiments is reported which shows that release is not a consequence of increased rate of cyclic AMP synthesis. It seems likely that PG stimulation of noradrenaline release is a result of calcium entry through dihydropyridine-sensitive channels by a mechanism independent of these two second messenger systems.\r"

PBD dose-dependently relaxed aortic, femoral arterial and mesenteric venous preparations precontracted with KCl and reduced the amplitude of spontaneous contractions of portal venous preparations; the sensitivity to PBD was femoral greater than portal greater than mesenteric greater than aorta. Relaxation response of the femoral artery to PBD was not changed by propranolol and aminophylline. Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isoproterenol (ISO), forskolin and adenosine also elicited dose-dependent relaxations of femoral arteries; the rank order of potency (mean negative log EC50 value) was GTN greater than ISO greater than PBD = forskolin greater than adenosine. The relaxation responses to PBD and isobutyl methylaxanthine (IBMX) were not attenuated with removal of endothelial cells. In the femoral artery, methylene blue diminished GTN-induced relaxation but not PBD-induced relaxation. PBD and IBMX increased the relaxation responses of the artery to cyclic AMP-forming drugs (ISO, forskolin and adenosine) but not a cyclic GMP-forming drug (GTN). PBD and IBMX increased the relaxation response of mesenteric veins to ISO. The drugs noncompetitively inhibited arterial contractions accompanied by voltage-dependent and alpha-adrenoceptor-operated Ca2+ influxes. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, PBD and IBMX reduced contractile responses of arteries to norepinephrine but not caffeine. The present results suggested that PBD relaxed the blood vessels, at least in part, through an intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP.\r"

The inhibitory effect, evident as a transient relaxation or inhibition of distension-induced reflex contractions, was abolished by adrenoreceptor blockade, guanethidine pretreatment or removal of the celiac ganglion complex, but was hexamethonium-and atropine-insensitive. The excitatory action of CCK-8 was atropine- and hexamethonium-sensitive, while being unaffected by guanethidine pretreatment. Ligation experiments indicated that the excitatory effect of CCK-8 originates from a stimulant action on structures in the upper duodenum/pyloric sphincter from which a propagated contraction travels to the distal duodenum. We conclude that i.v. CCK-8 inhibits small intestinal motility by directly activating sympathetic neurons in the celiac ganglion and initiates a propagated form of intestinal motility by stimulating neural elements in the upper part of the small intestine.\r"

The dose of isoproterenol delivered by the minipumps over 7 days corresponded to approximately 60 micrograms.kg-1h-1. The agonist treatment produced an 80% decrease in the number of beta adrenoceptors in lung membranes. However, a significant proportion of the remaining receptors could still form complexes with the nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) in the presence of agonist. This was demonstrated by the persistence of high affinity sites (42% versus 53% in controls, P less than .01) in isoproterenol competition binding curves and of the tight binding of isoproterenol in the presence of the reagent N-ethylmaleimide (44% versus 60% in controls, P less than .01). However, part of the receptor population displaying high affinity toward the agonist was insensitive to guanosine 5'-triphosphate. These changes were associated with a decrease in the Gs activity, as demonstrated by the lower degree of cholera toxin-mediated adenosine diphosphate ribosylation. Moreover, chronic against treatment caused a 50% reduction in the maximal relaxing effect of isoproterenol in the isolated lung parenchymal strip, whereas the tissue sensitivity to beta adrenoceptor stimulation was unchanged. It is concluded that chronic administration of isoproterenol to guinea pigs caused marked changes in beta adrenoceptor function in the lung tissue. The molecular events involved in beta adrenoceptor desensitization by chronic in vivo administration of relatively low catecholamine doses appear to differ from those reported for cultured cells, as well as those mediated by acute in vivo catecholamine administration.\r"

  ".W": "Toxicity of 2-ethylhexanol, a metabolite of diethylhexyl phthalate, was assessed in the perfused rat liver. Livers from starved rats were perfused with ethylhexanol (3 mM) dissolved in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C) saturated with 95% O2-5% CO2 in both the anterograde and retrograde direction. Following infusion of ethylhexanol, O2 uptake and ketone body formation were diminished by 50 and 80%, respectively, and cell damage, as assessed by the appearance of lactate dehydrogenase in the effluent perfusate, was apparent. Both inhibition of O2 uptake by ethylhexanol and the appearance of lactate dehydrogenase in the perfusate were dose-dependent. Only O2-rich upstream regions of the liver lobule were damaged as reflected by trypan blue uptake. Inhibition of O2 uptake by ethylhexanol was also reflected by a 60% decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio. Local rates of O2 uptake, measured using miniature electrodes placed on the liver surface, indicated that ethylhexanol only diminished O2 uptake in O2-rich upstream regions of the liver lobule regardless of the direction of flow. This phenomenon apparently can be explained by a direct effect of ethylhexanol on mitochondria in upstream regions since active state 3 rates of respiration were inhibited by ethylhexanol in isolated mitochondria. Ethylhexanol also caused a dose-dependent decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in the beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate (B/A) ratio. However, infusion of radical scavengers such as allopurinol, cianidanol and uric acid did not alter lactate dehydrogenase release due to ethylhexanol. Thus, the toxicity of ethylhexanol in the liver is dependent on local O2 tension and mitochondrial are primary targets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In rat CA3 pyramidal cells, the mu selective agonist (N-MePhe3,D-Pro4)-morphiceptin (PLO17) inhibited both the early and the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and increased excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitudes. Voltage clamp analysis of synaptic currents indicated that the excitatory postsynaptic current were not increased by PLO17, showing that the apparent increase in EPSPs was a result of a decrease in the underlying IPSP. The kappa agonists trans-(+)-3,4-dichloro-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate and dynorphin A (1-17) had no effect on EPSPs or IPSP conductances measured in rat pyramidal cells. Maximal inhibition of IPSPs by PLO17 resulted in a bursting response to stimulation in rat but not guinea pig CA3 pyramidal cells. In guinea pig CA3 pyramidal cells, PLO17 also inhibited IPSP conductances but did not affect EPSP amplitudes. In contrast to the lack of effect in rat pyramidal cells, trans-(+)-3,4-dichloro-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate (100 nM) inhibited the late IPSP conductance without influencing the EPSP or the early IPSP conductance of guinea pig pyramidal cells. Dynorphin A (1-17) (0.01-10 microM) did not affect resting membrane properties or evoked synaptic conductances in either preparation.

INjection of the delta-opioid receptor agonist, [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin, produced a markedly reduced motor stimulant action, as did injection of DAMGO outside the VP/SI. Injection of the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, or the antagonist of the GABAA chloride channel, picrotoxin, also produced a dose-related elevation in horizontal motor activity. In contrast, the GABAB receptor antagonist, phaclofen, was without effect. The motor stimulant actions of both DAMGO and picrotoxin were attenuated by pretreatment in the VP/SI with the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol. In contrast, pretreatment with the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone, abolished only the actions of DAMGO on motor activity. These data demonstrate that motor activity can be regulated in the VP/SI by mu-opioid and GABAA neurotransmission, and that the response to mu-opioids can be modulated by GABAergic transmission.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were undertaken to characterize pharmacologically a neuronal receptor to 5-HT in guinea pig ileum. Segments of longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus preparations were treated with phenoxybenzamine and exposed to submaximal electrical field stimulation to evoke the cholinergically mediated \"twitch\" response. The ability of 5-HT to enhance the submaximal twitch response was investigated. Results using several antagonists (metergoline, spiperone, cyanopindolol, N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptophyl-5-hydroxytryptophan amide, N-hexanoyl-5-hydroxytryptophyl-5-hydroxytryptophan amide, ICS 205-930, GR 38032F, MDL 72222 and cocaine) indicate that 5-HT (3 X 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-7) M) agonizes a novel 5-HT receptor site distinct from the 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT1P subtypes as well as the M receptor. The receptor site is located neuronally and is characterized positively by a low affinity for ICS 205-930 (pA2 = 6.5 vs. 5-HT) and by the following order of agonist potency: 5-HT greater than 5-methoxytryptamine greater than BRL 24924 greater than alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine greater than zacopride = cisapride = 5-carboxamidotryptamine. Agonist-independent pA2 estimates for ICS 205-930 (6.3-6.6) suggest a single site of agonism. 2-Methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindalpine were inactive at 1 x 10(-5) M either as agonists or antagonists. Thus, the receptor site exhibits a pharmacological profile similar to that characterizing the recently described 5-HT4 [corrected] receptor. Unlike Gaddum's M receptor, which equates with the 5-HT3 [corrected] receptor, the putative 5-HT4 [corrected] receptor site exhibits a higher sensitivity to agonism by 5-HT and is resistant to antagonism by cocaine.\r"

In vitro phenytoin covalent binding and metabolite formation were determined in hepatic microsomes from A/J mice. Covalent binding of a phenytoin-reactive intermediate to microsomal protein was linear with respect to time, protein concentration and phenytoin concentration. Covalent binding was inhibited by inhibitors of cytochrome P-450. Inducers of cytochrome P-450 enhanced phenytoin covalent binding as follows: phenobarbital greater than 3-methylcholanthrene greater than saline-treated controls. Low molecular weight thiols (GSH, cysteine and cysteamine), a thiol generator (methylthiazolidine carboxylate), and thiol modifying agents (N-ethylmaleimide, mercuric chloride and diamide) significantly inhibited covalent binding. Amino acids other than cysteine did not decrease the covalent binding. Formation of the metabolites, para-hydroxyphenytoin and phenytoin dihydrodiol, was greater following preincubation with GSH or cysteine. In summary, protein thiol groups appear to be important sites for in vitro covalent binding of a reactive intermediate of phenytoin. These data suggest glutathione may protect membrane-bound enzymes responsible for phenytoin metabolism from attack by an electrophilic or free radical reactive intermediate of phenytoin and GSH may inactivate a phenytoin-reactive metabolite by formation of a putative glutathione conjugate.\r"

In isolated rat liver mitochondria (RLM), oxmetidine inhibits pyruvate/malate- but not succinate-supported, ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption (state 3). The purpose of this investigation was to determine the exact molecular site of oxmetidine-induced inhibition of RLM electron transport. Oxmetidine did not significantly inhibit succinate-supported, ADP-stimulated state 3 oxygen consumption in isolated RLM at concentrations up to 0.5 mM. In contrast, oxmetidine significantly inhibited beta-hydroxybutyrate- or isocitrate-supported mitochondrial state 3 oxygen consumption at concentrations above 10 microM and 25 microM, respectively. In RLM electron transport particles (ETP), oxmetidine inhibited NADH-oxidase and NADH-CoQ reductase activity (IC50 of 3.4 microM and 2.6 microM, respectively). However, oxmetidine did not significantly affect NADH-Fe3(CN)6 reductase activity (at concentrations up to 200 microM). SK&F 92058, a thiourea analog of oxmetidine approximately 24-fold less toxic to hepatocytes, produced a similar pattern of inhibition of respiration, although far less potent (IC50 of 0.8 mM and 0.6 mM for NADH-oxidase and NADH-CoQ reductase, respectively). SK&F 92058 did not significantly inhibit NADH-Fe3(CN)6 reductase activity at concentrations up to 3.0 mM.

NO solutions prepared using 0.1 ml of NO/ml (NO/0.1), and 3 mM sodium nitrite (NO2-) were significantly (P less than .05) less potent vasodilators than NO/X and NO/25 (order of potency: NO/X = NO/25 greater than NO/0.1 greater than NO2-). A novel automated method was developed to monitor nitrogen oxides using continuous-flow spectrophotometric detection (diazotization reaction). The absorbance readings for the solutions were NO/X greater than NO/25 = NO/0.1 = NO2-. Argon purging of NO/X, NO/25 and NO/0.1 solutions significantly (P less than .05) reduced (44-100%) the bioactivity of these solutions in inverse proportion to the initial volume of NO used in their preparation. In contrast, the absorbance values were unchanged, indicating that the chemical assay was not correlated with the bioassay. Varying the duration of NO gassing (1-30 min) significantly (P less than .05) increased the absorbance values, while having no effect on the vascular relaxations, elicited by the solutions.

PGF2 alpha exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of acidification in both the mucosal and serosal media of animals in normal acid-base states. The ED50 was determined to be 5 X 10(-8) M. Animals placed in an NH4Cl-induced chronic metabolic acidosis demonstrated enhanced H+ excretion from normal which was inhibited by PGF2 alpha (10(-8) M). Frogs treated with ibuprofen (30 mg/kg/day for 3 days) stimulated mucosal acidification to a magnitude similar to the chronic metabolic acidosis animal, and this was inhibited by PGF2 alpha (10(-8) M) during the recovery phase. PGF2 alpha produced effects on both the mucosal proton excretion system and the serosal Na+/H+ exchanger mechanism.

  ".W": "The effects of marijuana smoke exposure on several measures of tobacco cigarette smoking behavior were examined. Eight healthy adult male volunteers, who smoked both tobacco and marijuana cigarettes, participated in residential studies, lasting 10 to 15 days, designed to measure the effects of marijuana smoke exposure on a range of behavioral variables. Tobacco cigarettes were available throughout the day (9:00 A.M. until midnight). Each day was divided into a private period (9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.), during which subjects were socially isolated, and a social period (5:00 P.M. to midnight), during which subjects could interact. Under blind conditions, subjects smoked placebo and active marijuana cigarettes (0%, 1.3%, 2.3%, or 2.7% delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol) four times daily (9:45 A.M., 1:30 P.M., 5:00 P.M. and 8:30 P.M.). Each subject was exposed to both placebo and one active dose over 2- to 5-consecutive-day intervals, and dose conditions (i.e., placebo or active) alternated throughout the study. Active marijuana smoking significantly decreased the number of daily tobacco smoking bouts, increased inter-bout intervals and decreased inter-puff intervals. Marijuana decreased the number of tobacco smoking bouts by delaying the initiation of tobacco cigarette smoking immediately after marijuana smoking, whereas decreases in inter-puff intervals were unrelated to the time of marijuana smoking. No consistent interactions between marijuana effects and social or private periods (i.e., time of day) were observed.\r"

After completion of the first \"procurement component\" response requirement, access to food, i.e., a meal, became available under the second \"consumption component,\" during which each response produced a 1-g food pellet. After a 10-min interval in which no response occurred, the consumption component was terminated. Complete dose-response functions for amphetamine and fenfluramine were determined before, during and after a period of repeated administration of each drug. On the first day of repeated administration both drugs decreased intake during both the first 8 hr and the entire session to 65% of baseline. Total intake returned to 93% of baseline during repeated amphetamine, but only to 76% of baseline during repeated fenfluramine. There was no recovery of intake, however, during the first 8 hr of the session. Baboons given repeated amphetamine were tolerant to the food intake decreasing effects of acute amphetamine, but not acute fenfluramine. Baboons given repeated fenfluramine did not develop tolerance to the effects of fenfluramine or amphetamine on food intake. The absence of cross-tolerance or increased sensitivity between amphetamine and fenfluramine suggests that although both serotonergic and dopaminergic systems are involved in feeding, they can influence food intake independently.\r"

Daily sessions involved p.o. ingestion of two capsules sequentially, one of which contained caffeine and the other placebo, under double-blind conditions. Each day subjects attempted to identify and were later informed which capsule contained caffeine and which contained placebo. All subjects acquired rapidly the initial discrimination (100 or 178 mg vs. placebo). Examination of progressively lower caffeine doses showed that accuracy and ratings of confidence in accuracy were increasing functions of dose. There were individual differences in the lowest discriminable dose: three subjects discriminated 56 mg, three discriminated 18 mg and one discriminated 10 mg. Discrimination accuracy was usually higher after the second capsule than after the first capsule. All subjects indicated that they believed that they made the discrimination predominantly on the basis of central effects of caffeine vs. placebo, such as changes in mood and socializing. Compared to placebo, 100 mg of caffeine increased ratings of alertness, well-being, social disposition, motivation for work, concentration, energy and self-confidence and decreased ratings of headache and sleepiness. This dose of caffeine also produced a large increase in a measure of \"euphoria.\" The present study documents biological activity of caffeine at lower doses than heretofore recognized. The general approach to investigating the effects of low drug doses may have broad application in human psychopharmacology research for characterizing other subtle psychotropic effects.\r"

The resting level of [Ca++]i was increased from 0.23 to 1.22 microM (P less than 0.05) by 10(-4) M histamine. After exposure to 10(-6) M doxorubicin for 1 hr, histamine increased [Ca++]i to only 0.34 microM (P less than 0.05 compared to the histamine alone value). Doxorubicin exposure for 1 hr completely blocked the increase in inositol trisphosphate caused by histamine. There was no block by doxorubicin of the release of intracellular Ca++ after microinjection of the cells with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Based on the results from studies with differentiated N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells doxorubicin may: 1) block the histamine-induced rise in [Ca++]i by decreasing synthesis of inositol polyphosphates, 2) block plasma membrane Ca++ channels that allow entry of extracellular Ca++ in response to histamine and/or 3) prevent recovery of histamine receptors after desensitization.\r"

  ".W": "This paper tests the hypothesis that spare serotonin 5-HT1c receptors are present in the rat choroid plexus and explores the possible influence of such sites on the adaptive regulation of the 5-HT1c receptor. The consequences of partial receptor inactivation were compared for the natural agonist 5-HT and the putative partial agonists trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) and (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). These studies showed approximately 50% reserve of 5-HT1c receptors in the rat choroid plexus. The calculated KA for 5-HT obtained by partial irreversible inactivation was 36 nM. Phenoxybenzamine reduced the maximum response elicited by TFMPP and LSD, without shifting the EC50 values, consistent with the interpretation that TFMPP and LSD are partial agonist at the 5-HT1c receptor in rat choroid plexus. The KA of TFMPP and LSD was 0.16 microM and 9 nM, respectively. Quantitative analysis of percentage of receptor occupancy vs. percentage of maximum response showed that 5-HT occupied only 70% of the receptors to give a maximum response, whereas a linear relationship between percentage of occupancy and response was found for TFMPP. These differences had functional consequences as demonstrated in studies of regulation of the 5-HT1c receptor. Chronic administration of the 5-HT agonist quipazine produced a 32% loss of 5-HT1c binding sites in the choroid plexus, with no change in the 5-HT-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis response. This dissociation between binding and function is likely explained by the receptor reserve that exists for the 5-HT1c receptors. Consistent with this interpretation, the TFMPP-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis signal was reduced to the same extent as the loss of binding sites. These results show that the 5-HT1c receptor in the choroid plexus adapts predictably to chronic receptor activation and suggest the possibility that the paradoxical regulation that has been described for other 5-HT receptors might be explained partially by the unrecognized existence of receptor reserve.\r"

We have examined further the effects of different classes of BZ receptor ligands on DA metabolism in the prefrontal cortex. The anxiogenic inverse agonist FG 7142 elevated selectively 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels and DO-PAC/DA ratio in the prefrontal cortex in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The activating effect was not, however, observed in any other mesocortical, mesolimbic or nigrostriatal DA terminal fields examined. Pretreatments with BZ agonists such as diazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam and CGS 9896 and BZ antagonists such as Ro15-1788 and CGS 8216 and barbiturates such as pentobarbital, significantly antagonized the beta-carboline-induced elevation of prefrontal DOPAC levels. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the pharmacological profile of different BZ receptor ligands on prefrontal DA metabolism and their profiles in behavioral, electrophysiological and receptor binding studies. Agonists increased DA levels and consequently decreased DOPAC/DA ratio in the prefrontal cortex. Inverse agonists, on the other hand, significantly elevated prefrontal DOPAC levels and DOPAC/DA ratio in a dose-dependent manner. Antagonists such as Ro15-1788 and CGS 8216, at low doses, did not alter mesoprefrontal DA metabolism, but at higher doses did elevate DOPAC/DA ratio in the prefrontal cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The intent of the present series of experiments was to better understand the events that produce a rapid adaptation of beta adrenergic and serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors when imipramine treatment and forced swim are combined in Sprague-Dawley rats. Beta adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptors were evaluated at specific stages of the forced swim test with and without imipramine treatment. Rapid changes in receptor binding were observed in saline-treated rats during specific stages of the test. The changes observed during forced swim could not be attributed to the transport-novelty that occurs during forced swim. Binding for both monoamine receptors was reduced in hippocampus and frontal cortex before the test swim in imipramine-treated rats as they were 10 min, 3 hr and 24 hr after the test swim. The increase in corticosterone induced by the second forced swim was not altered by imipramine, indicating that imipramine was not interfering with this measure of the stress response. In the Fisher-344 rat strain, imipramine did not produce a behavioral change during the test swim. In contrast to this lack of a behavioral change in the Fischer-344 rats, beta adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptor down-regulation was facilitated in this rat strain, similar to that found in imipramine-treated Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to swim. This latter finding suggests that beta adrenergic or 5-HT2 receptor adaptation alone is insufficient to cause an imipramine-induced behavioral change in the swim test. Studies with specific norepinephrine- and serotonin-uptake inhibitors, nisoxetine and fluoxetine, respectively, indicate that the behavioral effects of imipramine in the forced swim test are dependent upon norepinephrine uptake inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since then, increasing numbers of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria capable of inactivating penicillins and cephalosporins have been isolated clinically. One approach to the problem posed by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria has been to seek substances that function as inhibitors of beta-lactamase and that can be used to protect beta-lactam antibiotics from destruction by the bacterial enzymes. The first clinically available inhibitor was clavulanic acid, a metabolite of Streptomyces clavuligerus that was identified in a screening program for naturally occurring beta-lactamase inhibitors. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many bacterial beta-lactamases and has been formulated with amoxicillin and ticarcillin to produce broad-spectrum antibiotic combinations active against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. After the discovery of clavulanic acid, various compounds have been reported to function as inhibitors of bacterial beta-lactamases, but only sulbactam and its prodrug, sultamicillin, have become available commercially. The success of clavulanic acid has confirmed beta-lactamase inhibitors as one solution to the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\r"

This report reviews the comparative susceptibility data on 495 bacterial isolates obtained from obstetric and gynecologic patients and on 522 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates. Susceptibility testing was conducted with broth microdilution using twofold dilutions of antimicrobials. The overall minimal inhibitory concentrations-90 (MIC90) for the 495 isolates were very low, and few resistant isolates were found. The MIC90 for cefotetan was 16 times greater than that for ticarcillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam. Cephalosporins showed good activity against anaerobic cocci but variable activity against anaerobic gram-negative rods. A relatively high percentage of B fragilis group isolates were also resistant to clindamycin. The addition of 2 mg/mL of clavulanate to ticarcillin caused a 4- to 32-fold decrease in the MIC90 for various Bacteroides species. Less than 2% of the strains tested were resistant to clavulanate plus ticarcillin or amoxicillin. These results suggest that monotherapy with such agents could replace combination antibiotic therapy for mixed obstetric and gynecologic infections.\r"

Beta-lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to beta-lactamases and thus can prevent the destruction of active beta-lactam antibiotics. In the United States three beta-lactam-antibiotic/beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations are commercially available--the orally absorbed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (A/C), the parenteral formulations of ampicillin/sulbactam (A/S) and ticarcillin/clavulanate (T/C). In a multicenter study that focused on T/C, the in vitro activity of amoxicillin (AMOX), ampicillin (AMP) and ticarcillin (TIC) against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae was obliterated when beta-lactamase-positive strains were tested, but all tested strains were susceptible to the antibiotics in combination with their respective beta-lactamase inhibitors. Clavulanic acid improved the activity of TIC against most species of Enterobacteriaceae but not against those Enterobacteriaceae that elaborate type I beta-lactamase or against non-Enterobacteriaceae gram-negative bacilli (except for Pseudomonas maltophilia). Staphylococci are generally beta-lactamase positive and considered resistant to AMP and TIC, but greater than 99% of 1,137 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 92% of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to T/C, with comparable figures obtained for A/C and A/S. The activity of TIC against Bacteroides fragilis was improved up to 64-fold by clavulanic acid, with a definite but less pronounced effect on the non-fragilis Bacteroides species. Ninety-seven percent of strains of other anaerobic genera were susceptible to both TIC and T/C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Following induction of AIA (7 and 14 days) the ratio T helper/T suppressor was not significantly different in either strain. When the resistant strain was treated with 25 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide, the T suppressor cells were significantly reduced and this was followed by a strong potentiation of the AIA.

  ".W": "Several second-line antirheumatic agents possess both immunosuppressive and antimicrobial properties. Rifampin is an antimicrobial agent recently found to exhibit immunosuppressive activity in both animal and human studies. Intraarticular rifamycin SV, a rifampin derivative, has been reported to cause dramatic improvement in gonarthritis in 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These reports along with the personal observation of spontaneous improvement of arthritic symptoms in 2 patients with RA treated with rifampin at our institution, prompted us to conduct a pilot study using oral rifampin at 600-1200 mg daily in 8 patients with active, adult onset, seropositive RA. Although, no clinically important or statistically significant improvement occurred in any of the outcome variables measured (p greater than 0.12), the power of this study to detect such differences was limited. Alkaline phosphatase increased modestly in 7 patients. One patient developed an acute, drug induced, flu-like syndrome with marked elevation of liver enzymes which resolved promptly with drug withdrawal. We conclude that the potential effectiveness of oral rifampin therapy in RA is doubtful.\r"

Five of 59 patients (8.5%) had atlantoaxial subluxation. No patient presented atlantoaxial subluxation in neutral lateral cervical radiographs but all 5 had anterior atlantoaxial subluxation in full flexion films; one patient also had lateral subluxation. The 5 patients with atlantoaxial subluxation were compared with the remaining 54. Mean SLE disease duration was longer in patients with atlantoaxial subluxation (12 years) than in those without (6.6 years) (p less than 0.01). Jaccoud's syndrome, patellar tendon elongation and articular hypermobility were significantly more frequent in patients with atlantoaxial subluxation. The presence or history of arthritis failed to distinguish patients with and without atlantoaxial subluxation, while chronic renal failure and increased serum parathyroid hormone levels were significantly associated to the presence of atlantoaxial subluxation. We suggest that atlantoaxial subluxation is further evidence of tendinous alterations seen in patients with SLE.\r"

This was diagnosed in the patients whose minor labial salivary gland biopsy was graded greater than or equal to 3 (according to Chisolm and Mason), who also had keratoconjunctivitis sicca (positive rose bengal eye test) and/or xerostomia (subjective xerostomia and decreased stimulated parotid flow rate). Lip biopsy revealed focal round cell infiltration compatible with a greater than or equal to 3 grade in 11 patients, minimal perivascular infiltration in 21 patients and no infiltration in 28. In the positive biopsy group (greater than or equal to 3 grade) subjective xerophthalmia, decreased parotid flow rate, parotid gland enlargement, lymphadenopathy, presence of rheumatoid factor and anti-La (SSB) antibodies were significantly commoner than in the others. Of the 11 patients of this group, 5 had keratoconjunctivitis sicca which sufficed for the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome, suggesting a prevalence of 8.3% in our population with SLE. In these individuals subjective xerophthalmia (40%), positive Schirmer's I eye test (60%), decreased parotid flow rate (80%), parotid gland enlargement (80%) and presence of rheumatoid factor (80%) and anti-La (SSB) antibodies (80%) were significantly more frequent than in the remaining patients, whereas significant differences regarding other features of SLE were not observed. Our results suggest that Sjogren's syndrome in SLE is relatively rare and usually mild. Furthermore, it may present more similarities to primary Sjogren's syndrome than to secondary Sjogren's syndrome accompanying rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Two different alterations were present, myositis (11 cases), and vacuolar myopathy (1 case). The myositis exhibited muscle atrophy, microtubular inclusions, and a mononuclear cell infiltration. In one case, with increased serum creatine phosphokinase, fiber necrosis was evident. Capillary abnormalities included thickening and reduplication of basement membrane, alterations of endothelium and microtubular inclusions. The vacuolar myopathy also showed vacuolated muscle fibers and occasional zebra bodies. The different associations between muscle diseases and SLE are grouped. Our data suggest that SLE myositis is a distinct clinical and pathological entity. The SLE vacuolar myopathy is a pathological entity clinically undistinguishable from SLE myositis.\r"

However, few differences in clinical manifestations between males and females have been reported. To further investigate gender differences in SLE, the prevalence of 23 clinical manifestations of SLE were compared in a cohort of 62 men and 299 women. After adjusting for differences in age, race, and duration of followup, men were found to more commonly have seizures (odds ratio = 1.65; 95% confidence interval = 1.09, 2.49), and showed a trend to progress to renal failure more often (odds ratio = 1.40; 95% confidence interval = 0.96, 2.03) than women. Gender differences were not evident for the remaining 21 clinical features. The clinical similarity between men and women with SLE represents a circumstance in which the use of clinically defined patient subsets does not appear to facilitate the investigation of potential pathogenetic or etiologic factors.\r"

Negative biopsy patients were divided into 2 groups, one with 49 patients and a probable GCA syndrome (polymyalgia rheumatica with a negative biopsy) and a group with non-GCA (33 patients). Median percentage and number of CD8+ T cells were significantly decreased with definite GCA (CD8+% 10.0, CD8+ cells 0.221 x 10(9)/l), and probable GCA syndrome (CD8+% 10.0, CD8+ cells 0.197 x 10(9)/l) compared with non-GCA (CD8+% 22.0, CD8+ cells 0.527 x 10(9)/l) and controls (CD8% 21, CD8+ cells 0.518 x 10(9)/l). Significantly low CD8+ T cell values were found in nearly 80% of patients with active untreated GCA or GCA syndrome and in 15% of patients with non-GCA. Positive predictive value of a significant low CD8+ T cell value is 85% while the likelihood of no GCA or GCA syndrome with normal CD8+ T cell values is 60%.\r"

Histological examination of a lymph node biopsy revealed necrosis, hematoxylin bodies and LE cells, while a great amount of amorphous proteinaceous material was seen positive with immunofluorescence for IgG, IgM and complement (C3 and Clq).

Radiograms of the sacroiliac (SI) joints, lumbosacral spines and the hip joints were normal. Joint/bone scan revealed increased radionuclide activity over the involved SI joints in both cases. Computerized tomograms of the SI joints were abnormal in one patient. Both patients improved with aspirin, recovered and had no sequelae. Inflammatory sacroiliitis appears to be transient and benign. It is a rare event in young children. Possibly some of them are being treated as though they had septic arthritis.\r"

Resistant cell lines were derived by exposure to either amsacrine or doxorubicin. The resistance factor was calculated as the ratio of the mean IC50 value for the resistant cell line to that for the parent line. IC50 was defined as the concentration of drug inhibiting cell growth to 50% of that in control (drug-free) cultures. Patterns of cross-resistance were visualized by plotting the deviations of resistance factors from the mean resistance factor, on a logarithmic scale. Considerable variations in resistance factors were noted for each cell subline as the amsacrine substituents were altered. Four main patterns were evident: a transport-related multidrug-resistance pattern (three sublines), a pattern similar to that for a murine P388 leukemia subline resistant to amsacrine, and two patterns not observed previously. Since some of the sublines tested showed evidence of altered topoisomerase II activity, it appears that changes in the resistance pattern in these lines may reflect changes in the stability of the ternary complexes formed by the drug, the altered enzyme, and the DNA. The resistance factor was reduced from more than 100-fold to about 13-fold in three of the sublines tested and from eightfold to twofold in two others. This finding suggests that appropriate drug design may overcome several forms of multidrug resistance in human leukemia and other types of cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Nicotinamide, an agent previously reported to reduce hypoxia and increase the irradiation response of experimental tumors, has been evaluated for its effect on the occurrence of acute hypoxia in the murine squamous cell tumor SCCVII. Treatment of C3H mice bearing 500-750-mg subcutaneous tumors with nicotinamide (1.0 mg/g intraperitoneally) 1 hour prior to irradiation resulted in an enhancement ratio of 1.3 (+/- 0.1). We assessed the effect of nicotinamide on the response of acutely hypoxic cells in vivo using a recently developed fluorescence-activated-cell sorting technique. This technique employs the in vivo pharmacokinetic and DNA binding properties of the bisbenzamide stain Hoechst 33342. The results clearly show that nicotinamide, at the doses used, reduces the amount of acute hypoxia in these SCCVII tumors. We confirmed these findings using a histological technique that facilitates the assessment of functional tumor vasculature at two instances in time. This method shows that nicotinamide reduces the number of vessels opening and closing over a 20-minute period from 10.3% to 2.0%. The identification of a compound that can modify the dynamic fluctuations in microregional oxygen delivery in tumors could have important implications for radiation therapy.\r"

  ".U": "90204575\r", 
  ".W": "The local anesthetic procaine hydrochloride (P.HCl) had little effect on the sensitivity of P388 leukemic cells to cisplatin (DDP) in vitro, but the simultaneous administration of DDP and P.HCl (40 mg/kg) to BDF1 mice produced 50% lethal dose (LD50) and 90% lethal dose (LD90) values approximately two times higher than those observed with DDP alone. DDP-P.HCl diluted in water and administered intraperitoneally (IP) on day 1 and on days 1 and 5 to BDF1 mice bearing P388 leukemic cells produced 33% and 50% cure rates, respectively, at the maximum tolerated dose (16 mg/kg for the single administration and 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 5). In contrast, under the same conditions, the cure rates obtained with DDP alone (10 mg/kg for the single administration and 8 mg/kg given on days 1 and 5) were 17% and 9%, respectively. Protection from DDP nephrotoxicity seems to be the explanation for the higher doses of DDP that mice can tolerate when DDP is given simultaneously with P.HCl. In fact, the increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels observed 4-7 days following a single IP administration of DDP (8 or 16 mg/kg), as well as the tubular degenerative changes detected by light microscopy, were not observed when the same doses of DDP were given simultaneously with P.HCl. Since DDP nephrotoxicity is known to be reduced when the drug is diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution, we compared the combinations DDP-P.HCl in water, and DDP and DDP-P.HCl in 0.9% NaCl solution. The antitumor activity of DDP diluted in water and administered with P.HCl was similar to that observed in mice treated with DDP alone diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution. However, further improvement of the therapeutic index was achieved after the administration of DDP-P.HCl diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution; this regimen produced a cure rate of 67% (12 of 18 animals). The clinical relevance of these findings is strengthened by the observation that similar results were obtained when P.HCl was given by the intravenous route.\r"

  ".W": "Overreplication of DNA associated with gene amplification and drug resistance has been reported to occur after transient hypoxia of rodent cells. Because oxygen levels fluctuate in solid tumors, clinical drug resistance might be stimulated by this mechanism. We have therefore studied the effect of transient hypoxia on sensitivity to doxorubicin in human and murine cell lines. Exposure to hypoxia led to a decreased rate of cell proliferation, and most of the observed changes in sensitivity to doxorubicin were consistent with cell cycle-dependent cytotoxicity of this drug. After transient hypoxia, about 10% of the murine cells (EMT6/Ro and KHT-LP1) contained greater than four times the haploid DNA content (greater than 4C DNA), but only 0%-5% of the human cells (MGH-U1, A549, and Hey) had greater than 4C DNA content. Murine cells that had been exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and which had greater than 4C DNA content, were separated by flow cytometry. For KHT-LP1 cells, but not for EMT6/Ro cells, this subpopulation was found to be more resistant to doxorubicin than the subpopulation with less than 4C DNA content and the aerobic control. When resistant KHT-LP1 clones were expanded in the presence of doxorubicin, six of six clones showed amplification of the P-glycoprotein gene family. The ability and efficiency of hypoxia to induce DNA overreplication, gene amplification, and drug resistance appears to be cell-line dependent.\r"

Overall, incidence rose 45% during this period. The largest increases occurred in women 60 years of age or older (74%) and in those 45-59 (36%). The rate in women aged 20-44 has remained essentially unchanged. Localized and regional disease showed similar increases. Review of medical records revealed that only a small portion of this increase was likely to result from increased screening activities. From the increased availability of receptor assays in a large proportion of cases since the mid-1970s, we observed that incidence of estrogen receptor-negative cancers rose 22%-27% between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s. In contrast, incidence of estrogen receptor-positive tumors increased an average of 131% in the same period, perhaps implicating hormonal factors in the rising incidence of breast cancer.\r"

In the present samples, the presence of A1 allele of the dopamine D2 receptor gene correctly classified 77% of alcoholics, and its absence classified 72% of nonalcoholics. The polymorphic pattern of this receptor gene suggests that a gene that confers susceptibility to at least one form of alcoholism is located on the q22-q23 region of chromosome 11.\r"

Serologic evidence of B19 infection was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of the school and day-care personnel, 58% had evidence of previous B19 infection. The minimal rate of B19 infection in susceptible personnel during the outbreak was 19%. The risk was increased for teachers and day-care providers who had contact with younger children and with greater numbers of ill children. These results suggest that B19 infection is an occupational risk for school and day-care personnel.\r"

These highly publicized announcements disseminate information quickly, often many months before new data are presented at medical meetings or published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Such unconventional communications, however, usually do not provide sufficient detail for physicians to evaluate new studies, answer patients' questions, or make recommendations. We suggest that physicians would be better informed about therapeutic advances through (1) expanded information in unconventional communications, (2) increased availability of information from the Food and Drug Administration, (3) early submission and accelerated review of key medical journal articles, and (4) expanded use of on-line computerized information sources. A commitment to inform physicians better about promising new treatments may help save or prolong the lives of patients with severe illnesses.\r"

Each of the 69 patients with colon cancer (32 men and 37 women) was matched with a control patient who was randomly selected. At the time of diagnosis, the patients with colon cancer had significantly lower serum cholesterol values than control patients (5.56 +/- 0.31 mmol/L [SEM] vs 6.47 +/- 0.34 mmol/L). This difference did not vary with sex or Dukes' stage of the cancer. The percent of matched pairs in which the cancer patient had a lower serum cholesterol level increased from 42% at 10 years prior to cancer diagnosis to 77% at diagnosis. The ratio of serum cholesterol at each period to the level at time of diagnosis demonstrated an average decline of 13% during the 10 years prior to diagnosis for case patients vs an average rise of 2% in the same period for control patients. We conclude that individuals in whom colorectal cancer develops share the same level of serum cholesterol as the general population initially, but during the 10 years preceding the cancer demonstrate a decline in serum cholesterol level that is opposite to the rising level seen with age in the general population.\r"

  ".U": "90204753\r", 
  ".W": "Data from two pharmaceutical marketing research databases, the National Prescription Audit and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, were used to study trends in outpatient use of cholesterol-lowering drugs in the United States from 1978 through 1988. Retail pharmacies dispensed an estimated 4.4 million prescriptions for cholesterol-lowering drugs in 1978. This declined to 2.6 million in 1983 and increased dramatically to nearly 13 million in 1988. This fivefold increase between 1983 and 1988 was accounted for primarily by the introduction and use of two new drugs, gemfibrozil and lovastatin, and, to a lesser extent, by the increasing use of some older drugs. In 1988, after 1 full year of marketing, lovastatin was the leading cholesterol-lowering drug, followed closely by gemfibrozil; both drugs are currently considered second-line agents. Clofibrate and dextrothyroxine, drugs that ranked first and second in 1978, declined to ranks of sixth and eighth out of eight in 1988. Cholestyramine, gemfibrozil, and lovastatin accounted for about 75% of all lipid-lowering prescriptions in 1988. From 1978 through 1988, an average 54% of individuals using cholesterol-lowering drugs were 60 years of age or older. The 13 million prescriptions for cholesterol-lowering drugs in 1988 represent a maximum estimate of 13 million treated individuals. This number compares with the 60 million Americans with high cholesterol levels who are candidates for dietary advice, and, if cholesterol levels do not improve, for combined diet and drug intervention.\r"

Complete follow-up through 1986 was achieved in virtually all 6262 individuals in Sweden who were diagnosed from 1960 through 1984 as having a malignant disease before the age of 20 years. Proportional hazards analysis revealed a 22% lower death rate overall in females than in males. The difference was unrelated to age at diagnosis for tumors arising in the nervous system and the hematopoietic system (lymphomas and leukemias) but strongly dependent on age for sarcomas and, notably, for all remaining cancers--mostly epithelial. Males and females had similar hazard rates for epithelial cancers before the age of 11 years. At ages 11 to 19 years, the rates in females were 55% to 65% lower than in males. One conceivable explanation for these findings is that female sex hormones prevent the establishment of distant metastases in certain malignant diseases.\r"

Of the 793 intravenous drug users (27.1%) who had donated blood or plasma, 652 (82.2%) donated after they had started using intravenous drugs. Most subjects donated at commercial plasma centers, where they were paid $10 to $15 per donation. Although the HIV-1 seroprevalence of the entire cohort was 24.1%, the HIV-1 seroprevalence among those reporting plasma or blood donations declined progressively with time, from 17.1% in those who last donated in 1985 to 3.6% in those who last donated in 1988-1989. Many of the 437 intravenous drug users who had donated plasma or blood since 1985, when screening for HIV-1 was initiated, had not been notified and counseled about their HIV test results. Current programs to exclude individuals with a history of intravenous drug use from the plasma donor pool should be reevaluated and improved.\r"

  ".W": "The tobacco industry recommends \"common courtesy\" as the solution to potential conflicts over smoking in public places and as an alternative to policies that restrict or ban smoking. Specifically, the industry suggests that nonsmokers \"mention annoyances in a pleasant and friendly manner\" and that smokers ask others, \"Do you mind if I smoke?\" We analyzed data for 22,000 adults who responded to the 1987 National Health Interview Survey of Cancer Epidemiology and Control to determine if common courtesy is being used in passive-smoking situations. Almost half (47%) of smokers said they light up inside public places without asking if others mind. When someone lights up a cigarette inside a public place, only 4% of nonsmokers ask the person not to smoke despite the fact that most nonsmokers consider secondhand smoke harmful and annoying. We compared these data with similar data collected by the Roper Organization in the 1970s and found that smokers today are less likely to smoke inside public places. However, nonsmokers' actions in response to secondhand smoke have changed very little. These findings show that the common courtesy approach endorsed by the tobacco industry is unlikely, by itself, to eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Though no one would oppose the use of common courtesy, we conclude that legislative or administrative mechanisms are the only effective strategies to eliminate passive smoking.\r"

  ".W": "Operative transluminal coronary artery balloon angioplasty has been used for over 3000 lesions in 1000 patients since 1980. Initially it was only used for distal stenoses not accessible to coronary bypass grafting in 200 patients. Recatheterization of patients who had intraoperative transluminal balloon angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending, right, and circumflex coronary arteries 3 years previously revealed excellent patency of both the bypass grafts and the dilated native coronary arteries. This observation supports the thesis that with properly constructed bypass anastomoses competitive flow does not significantly mandate graft thrombosis. Subsequently, intraoperative balloon angioplasty has been performed for both proximal and distal stenoses in 800 patients to improve native coronary artery perfusion and maximize revascularization. Follow-up from 1 to 7 years revealed perioperative myocardial infarction in 21 patients (2.1%) and death in 19 patients (1.9%). Recatheterization from 1 to 7 years after the operation in 51 patients (41 with symptoms) revealed that patency was almost as prevalent in arteries subjected to angioplasty (82%; 137/167) as in bypass grafts (84%; 102/122). Intraoperative balloon angioplasty appears to improve coronary artery perfusion without detrimental competitive flow when used with bypass grafts.\r"

The limited incision is a lateral muscle-splitting incision with preservation of the latissimus dorsi, splitting of the serratus anterior, and cutting of only the intercostal muscles without rib resection. Patients were designated unsuitable for operation if (1) biopsy-proved distant metastasis existed, (2) mediastinoscopy revealed extranodal metastasis, or (3) severe respiratory compromise resulted in shortness of breath at rest with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of less than 0.75 L (four patients). Mean patient age was 60.9 (+/- 15.7) years. Surgical procedures included lobectomy (n = 317), pneumonectomy (n = 41), wedge resection (n = 82), resections of blebs or bullae (n = 17), thoracotomy and biopsy for unresectable lesion (n = 6), and decortication (n = 5). Pathologic analysis revealed 354 malignant tumors, 102 benign lesions, and 12 carcinoids. The perioperative mortality rate was 0.85% (4/468) and major morbidity was present in 2.9% (14/468). Mean operative time was 73.1 (+/- 32.2) minutes with a blood loss resulting in a mean decrease of the hematocrit value of 2.6 (+/- 2.5) gm; three patients were given a total of 7 units of blood. Most patients do not require a stay in the intensive care unit postoperatively (less than 10%). Hospital stay postoperatively was a mean of 6.1 (+/- 2.9 days. The limited incision is a significant factor in decreasing operative time, blood loss, postoperative pain and morbidity, and cost.\r"

Between 1970 and 1988, 45 patients from birth to 13 years of age (23 boys and 22 girls) underwent evaluation and treatment for bronchopulmonary malformations. Thirty-seven had solitary lesions: bronchogenic cyst (n = 13), cystic adenomatoid malformation (n = 9), congenital lobar emphysema (n = 6), pulmonary sequestration (n = 6), arteriovenous malformation (n = 2), and bronchial atresia (n = 1). Eight additional patients had two simultaneous abnormalities and three patients had congenital diaphragmatic hernias. Twenty-one patients had respiratory symptoms, which were severe in seven. Twelve had pulmonary infection and 10 patients were completely free of symptoms. Plain chest roentgenogram was the only diagnostic imaging performed in 11 patients. Thirteen patients underwent computed tomographic scan, but in only four was it essential for diagnosis. Prenatal ultrasonography in three patients demonstrated cystic adenomatoid malformation in two, with one false negative study. Postnatally, ultrasonography was also useful in establishing the diagnoses of cystic adenomatoid malformation and pulmonary sequestration. Thoracotomy with excision of the lesion by lobectomy or pneumonectomy resulted in survival of 42 patients (93%). Three deaths in neonates were due to pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension. Two of them had concomitant diaphragmatic hernia; the other had a cystic adenomatoid malformation and died despite the use of postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These data demonstrate that congenital bronchopulmonary malformations usually can be diagnosed by plain chest x-ray films. Ancillary studies such as ultrasonography or computed tomography may occasionally be necessary. Combinations of the different types of bronchopulmonary malformations occurred frequently. All lesions, including symptomatic lesions in neonates, can be managed surgically soon after diagnosis.\r"

From 1970 to 1988, 62 patients with benign and malignant tracheal stenosis had airway continuity established with a silicone tube. A straight graft was used in 48 patients. Twenty-eight had strictures, two tracheoesophageal fistulas and strictures, five primary malacia, and 13 malignant tumors. In 20 with noncancerous tracheal obstruction the airway was resected and a graft interposed. Distal suture line granulomas developed in six of these patients. Two had subglottic granulomas. One had graft dehiscence after dissolution of absorbable suture material. This graft was replaced with a silicone T tube. Four patients with end-to-end anastomosis of the graft to the trachea died in 6 to 12 months. Six others were lost to follow-up. In 15 of the 48 with benign disease the stent was placed within the lumen. Six in this group died. Thirteen of the 48 patients had a malignant tumor. In six the tube was used for palliation; none are alive. Seven underwent resection; five are living 1 to 8 years after the operation, two died of their disease in 1 1/2 to 2 years, and two of the five living are undergoing irradiation for recurrent cancer. Fourteen individuals with tracheocarinal malignancy received a bifurcated graft. All six patients with a palliative intraluminal stent died. Among eight individuals, four died of disease in 1 to 4 years. Four are alive, but two have suture line granulomas and two are undergoing irradiation for residual carcinoma. Mediastinal infection, mucus encrustations of the intraluminal prosthesis, and impedence of pulmonary secretions across long tubular segments have not been manifest. These silicone tubes are well tolerated and function satisfactorily as an airway.\r"

After operation the blood flow was adequately preserved, and healing of the anastomosis site was satisfactory in the minimum detachment group and steroid-treated group. Mucosal blood flow was markedly reduced in both proximal and distal sides in the extensive detachment group. The extent of the reduction in the blood flow was smaller in the omentum dressing group than in the extensive detachment group.

Abnormal findings on bone scan are associated with corresponding normal findings on radiographs in approximately 50% of cases. Definitive tissue diagnosis of the bone lesion is often needed to determine optimal therapy, but localization of the lesion is imprecise unless it is palpable. Use of the nuclear scan to localize and mark the rib enhances the precision of the biopsy procedure. Thirty-three consecutive patients with cancer who had bone scans suggestive of rib abnormalities underwent nuclear scan-guided biopsy. Each patient had a repeat localizing scan with a maximum permissible dose of technetium 99m radionuclide on the day of the planned biopsy. The site of abnormality was marked with methylene blue injected into the skin overlying the lesion and down to the periosteum at the specific site. The patient was then taken to the operating room and the marked area was excised through a small incision. Pathologic abnormality was identified in all but one of the resected specimens, an accuracy rate of 97%. Despite a presumed or proved diagnosis of cancer in 33 patients, 16 specimens (48%) were benign. There were no complications associated with this technique, which reduces the morbidity and increases the precision of rib biopsy.\r"

  ".U": "90205143\r", 
  ".W": "From January 1975 to June 1988, 275 patients underwent mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation, pure (148 patients) or associated with mitral stenosis (127 patients). Patients with pure mitral stenosis were excluded from this study. The cause of mitral regurgitation was rheumatic in 180 patients (aged 28.6 +/- 1.2 years, mean +/- standard error of the mean) and degenerative in 84 patients (aged 54.7 +/- 1.5 years). Fifty-nine percent of the patients were in New York Heart Association classes III and IV before the operation. Intraoperative assessment of the mitral valve led us to identify four major mechanisms of mitral regurgitation: (1) restriction of leaflet motion by fibrosis (group I, 63 patients); (2) enhancement of leaflet motion by leaflet and chordal extension and prolapse (group II, 139 patients), (3) combination of both (group III, 64 patients); and (4) isolated dilatation of the anulus (group IV, 10 patients). One hundred sixty-one patients had isolated mitral disease and 114 had associated aortic or tricuspid valve disease, or both. The hospital mortality rate was 4.0%. Follow-up was 96% complete and totaled 1247.47 patient-years. At 13 years' follow-up, the survival rate was 93.0% +/- 6.8% in group I, 90.0% +/- 6.0% in group II, and 96.6% +/- 4.6% in group III. Freedom from reoperation was 78.1% +/- 21.0%, 83.2% +/- 18.9%, and 79.6% +/- 16.2%, respectively. Freedom from embolism was 94.7% for the whole series. In patients with isolated mitral valve repair, the cumulative morbidity was significantly higher in groups I (6.3 +/- 2.0%/pt-yr) and III 6.3% +/- 1.7%/pt-yr) than in group II (2.5% +/- 0.9%/pt-yr, p less than 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified age and associated tricuspid valve disease as significant predictors of reoperation (p less than 0.01 for both factors). These results suggest that conservative surgery should be used with caution in group I and III patients. In contrast, indications for mitral valve repair should be extended in group II patients. This observation has important clinical implications since, in Western countries, valve prolapse tends to be a major cause of mitral regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "During a 20-year period 303 young subjects between 9 and 20 years of age (mean, 16.2 +/- 2.72 years) with rapid and relentlessly progressive valvular disease from rheumatic fever underwent valve replacements. The Starr-Edwards ball valve prosthesis remains the device of choice, although other valves have been implanted. The overall hospital mortality rate was 9.6% in the mitral valve, 3.5% in the aortic valve, and 4.2% in the double valve replacement groups. Actuarial survival at 10, 15, and 20 years was 78.4% (+/- 3.3%), 70.0% (+/- 5.8%), and 59.3% (+/- 11.1%), respectively, for patients with mitral valve replacement. The rates for aortic valve replacement were 85.9% (+/- 4.6%) at 10 and 15 years and 72.7% (12.8%) at 20 years. In the double valve replacement group the survival rates after 5 and 10 years were 79.9% (+/- 5.1%). The incidence of thromboembolism was 0.41, 0.59, and 1.04 per 100 patient-years for the mitral, aortic, and double-valve prostheses, respectively. The prospect of childbearing seems promising in those young women who were subsequently married. Our favorable and gratifying experience in this review bears testimony to the physiologic advantages of the Starr-Edwards valve as the device of choice in the rehabilitation of patients with advanced and severe valvular disease after rheumatic fever.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy persists regarding whether the efficacy of closed instrumental mitral commissurotomy compares well enough with that of open commissurotomy to warrant its continued use. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of operation as determined by catheterization studies in 63 patients with pure, severe, and noncalcified mitral stenosis. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: thirty-two patients were operated on by the closed technique (group I) and 31 by the open technique (group II). All patients underwent left-sided and right-sided catheterization before and 4 months after operation. Preoperatively the two groups were statistically similar with regard to major clinical data and hemodynamic findings. There were no deaths at operation or systemic embolism in the two groups. The prevalence of surgically induced mitral regurgitation was similar in the two groups (12.4% versus 12.9%). Pulmonary arterial pressure and arteriolar and total pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly in the two groups. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 23.3 +/- 8.5 to 15.8 +/- 7 mm Hg in group I (p less than 0.001) and from 23.7 +/- 6 to 14 +/- 5.8 mm Hg in group II (p less than 0.001). Cardiac index increased from 2.86 +/- 0.84 to 3.14 +/- 0.78 L/min/m2 in group I, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. In group II cardiac index increased from 2.89 +/- 0.6 to 3.6 +/- 0.6 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.005). The mean and end-diastolic transmitral pressure gradients decreased significantly in the two groups, but the decrease was statistically greater in the open mitral commissurotomy group (p less than 0.001). Mitral valve area increased from 0.82 +/- 0.18 to 1.4 +/- 0.40 cm2 in group I (p less than 0.01) and from 0.84 +/- 0.15 to 2.14 +/- 0.53 cm2 in group II (p less than 0.001). The mean increase in mitral valve area was 0.61 cm2 in group I and 1.34 cm2 in group II (p less than 0.001). At exercise, in patients with resting pulmonary capillary wedge pressures of 18 mm Hg or less, cardiac index increased by 36% in group I (23 patients) and 48% in group II (24 patients), because of a smaller mitral valve area in group I (1.61 +/- 0.39 cm2) than in group II (2.45 +/- 0.65 cm2). Thus open commissurotomy improved hemodynamic values to a greater extent than closed commissurotomy at both rest and exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine changes in cardiac function after aortic valve replacement in patients with chronic aortic stenosis. Eleven consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis were studied by radionuclide angiocardiography before; after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 18 to 24 hours; and late after operation. Measurements of cardiac output, mean systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and left ventricular ejection fraction were similar before and immediately after operation. Significant early changes were observed in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (27 to 13 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (214 to 166 ml; p less than 0.01), pulmonary blood volume (700 to 462 ml/m2; p less than 0.01), and right ventricular ejection fraction (0.54 to 0.68; p less than 0.001). A radionuclide angiocardiogram acquired a mean of 3.5 months after operation revealed increased resting left ventricular ejection fraction (0.49 to 0.58; p = 0.05), decreased end-systolic volume (91 to 59 ml; p less than 0.05), and decreased end-diastolic volume (166 to 135 ml; p less than 0.02) compared with measurements before operation. Improved exercise tolerance occurred in nine patients. The significant change in function during the early period after valve replacement was a maintenance of baseline cardiac output at a reduced level of left ventricular filling. Several months after operation, left ventricular volumes decreased further, resting ventricular performance was improved, and improved maximal exercise function was demonstrated. These changes probably reflected morphologic normalization after aortic valve replacement.\r"

  ".U": "90205147\r", 
  ".W": "From 1978 through 1987, 225 patients underwent operations that included replacement of the ascending aorta. One hundred twenty-three patients underwent composite aortic valve and ascending aortic replacement, 30 had aortic valve replacement with separate graft replacement of the ascending aorta, and 72 underwent replacement of the ascending aorta without aortic valve replacement. Thirty-one (13.8%) in-hospital deaths occurred. Univariate testing of preoperative and operative variables followed by logistic regression analyses identified miscellaneous aortic disease, coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic arch replacement, emergency operation, surgical date (1978 to 1983), and age (all p less than 0.05) as factors having independent association with in-hospital mortality. Follow-up of in-hospital survivors (mean interval 46 months, range 8 to 123 months) documented an overall 5-year survival rate of 76%, 83% after primary operation and 37% after reoperation. Univariate analyses followed by multivariate testing indicated that previous operation (p less than 0.0001) and a history of preoperative neurologic symptoms (p = 0.021) were associated with decreased late survival. At follow-up 88% of late survivors were free of symptoms. Seven patients have undergone reoperation 1 day to 69 months postoperatively. Although the in-hospital mortality for operations that include ascending aortic replacement exceeds that for isolated aortic valve replacement, the late death rate and rate of reoperation are low.\r"

  ".W": "Resection of aneurysms of the entire descending thoracic aorta and segments of the abdominal aorta is associated with a substantial incidence of spinal cord ischemic injury, particularly in patients with aortic dissection. Since hypothermia has a protective effect on spinal cord function, we evaluated a technique of total cardiopulmonary bypass with periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest and low flow (rectal/bladder temperatures of 15 degrees to 19 degrees C) in five patients requiring replacement of the entire descending thoracic and the upper abdominal aorta and judged to be at high risk for the development of spinal cord injury. All patent lower intercostal and lumbar arteries were preserved or reimplanted during the hypothermic interval. There was one hospital death. None of the four survivors had a new spinal neurologic deficit, renal or cardiac dysfunction, or required reoperation for bleeding. Transfusion of blood products was not excessive. Severe pulmonary dysfunction necessitating tracheostomy occurred in one patient and contributed to his death 7 weeks postoperatively. The remaining three patients are well 8 to 36 months postoperatively. This initial experience suggests that hypothermic perfusion and circulatory arrest can be safely implemented in selected patients who require extensive aortic resections and who are at substantial risk for the development of spinal cord injury. Further evaluation of this technique is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "The effectiveness of Fluosol-DA (Green Cross Corporation, Osaka, Japan) on circulatory dynamics and neurologic outcome in dogs with ischemic spinal cord injury produced by aortic crossclamping was tested. The control group (receiving saline solution) had an elevated mean aortic proximal pressure (112.9 +/- 30.2 mm Hg versus 175.3 +/- 20.5 mm Hg, p greater than 0.05) and a drastic drop in mean distal aortic pressure (112.9 +/- 30.2 mm Hg versus 29.8 +/- 11.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Although the same trend occurred in dogs treated prophylactically with Fluosol-DA, these changes were not statistically significant. However, there was a significant difference in mean distal aortic pressure during the ischemic phase between the two groups (58.9 +/- 16.0 mm Hg versus 29.8 +/- 11.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Postoperatively all animals had mean arterial pressures within the normal range. All dogs in the control group were paraplegic (partial or complete); the treatment group had one dog with partial paraplegia. The difference between the mean neurologic scores of the two groups was of high statistical significance (3.7 +/- 0.5 versus 1.6 +/- 1.0, p less than 0.05). Our preliminary results show that prophylactic use of Fluosol-DA has favorable effects on hemodynamics and neurologic outcome in dogs with spinal cord ischemia produced by aortic crossclamping. The high propensity of the drug to carry oxygen and carbon dioxide and to provide nutritional support to the ischemic area with resultant improvement in local microcirculation and blood rheology are some speculative mechanisms advocated for these changes.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is being performed with increasing frequency for incapacitating pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic large-vessel pulmonary embolism. However, patient-related risk factors and procedural complications associated with morbidity and mortality have not been fully defined. From Oct. 1, 1984, to April 10, 1989, we performed pulmonary thromboendarterectomy using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest in 127 consecutive patients (62.2% male, mean age 50 +/- 16 [standard deviation], range 20 to 82 years) in whom the exposure and dissection of the pulmonary arteries and methods for myocardial protection have been standardized. End points for univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors were reperfusion pulmonary edema leading to respiratory insufficiency as defined by ventilator dependency (greater than or equal to 5 days) (31.5%, 39/124) and hospital mortality (12.6%, 16/127). Multivariate analyses showed that ascites and need for 4 units of blood or more predicted ventilator dependency (p less than 0.03). Increased cardiopulmonary bypass times predicted both end points (p less than 0.03 to less than 0.0001), and failure to achieve at least a 50% reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance strongly predicted hospital death (p less than 0.0001). However, other factors that exhibited trends for association with one of the end points may prove important with a larger sample size. A hospital mortality rate of 12.6% for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is acceptable when compared with approximately 25% for heart-lung transplantation, which is the only therapeutic alternative. Increased ventilator dependency and hospital mortality can be anticipated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass times and inadequate reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance.\r"

As a result, in the current era of percutaneous balloon dilatation, the optimal mode of therapy remains controversial. An approach of stabilization with cardiopulmonary bypass, followed by relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, was used at three institutions, and the results are presented. During the period 1983 to 1989, 40 neonates with isolated aortic stenosis and patent ductus arteriosus or coarctation of the aorta, or both, underwent operative therapy. Ages ranged from 1 to 30 days, median of 12 days, including 17 patients in the first week of life. There were 30 boys and 10 girls; weights ranged from 2.5 to 5.5 kg with a mean of 3.6 kg. Perioperative conditions included congestive heart failure in 38 and mitral regurgitation in 16; left ventricular-aortic gradients ranged from 15 to 130 mm Hg, with a mean of 67 mm Hg. There were 30 open valvotomies and 10 transventricular dilatations. The hospital survival rate was 87.5% (35/40) with no significant difference between the methods of valvotomy (9/10 in the transventricular dilatation group, 90%; 26/30 in the open valvotomy group, 87%). Although multiple methods of perfusion and valvotomy were used, the single unifying factor of cardiopulmonary bypass stabilization was present in all 40 patients. No significant difference in survival was noted between institutions, methods of cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiopulmonary bypass times, crossclamp times, or method of valvotomy. There have been five reoperations, with one late death in a patient requiring mitral valve replacement and an apical-aortic conduit. One sudden death occurred; autopsy revealed endocardial fibroelastosis. Results demonstrate that in the three institutions using the methods described, a high operative and late survival rate is possible. The results of this technique, against which percutaneous dilatation should be compared, are standard in the current era.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental lamb models were used for intrauterine creation of pulmonary artery stenosis and later intrauterine repair or postnatal repair. Intrauterine creation of pulmonary artery stenosis was performed in 23 fetal lambs at 90 +/- 1 days of gestation. Eight lambs underwent intrauterine repair of pulmonary artery stenosis at 135 +/- 1 days of gestation and were studied 110 +/- 13 days after repair. Seven lambs underwent postnatal repair at 57 +/- 9 days after birth and were studied 162 +/- 32 days after repair. Eight fetal lambs with unrepaired pulmonary artery stenosis were studied 89 +/- 18 days after birth. All study lambs were compared with normal control lambs. The systolic right ventricular pressure was significantly higher after unrepaired stenosis (78.6 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) than in other lambs, but there was no statistically significant difference after intrauterine repair (23.3 +/- 2.9 mm Hg), postnatal repair (25.9 +/- 3.4 mm Hg), and normal lambs (21.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg). The systolic pulmonary artery pressure was also not statistically different in these three groups. The weight measurements were age-adjusted for comparison of postnatal and intrauterine repair with normal lambs. The adjusted heart weights were similar in the three groups. The comparison of the adjusted heart weight/adjusted body weight ratio (10(-3) showed a significantly higher ratio in postnatal repair (7.4 +/- 0.1) than in intrauterine repair (6.1 +/- 0.1). The adjusted right ventricular weight/adjusted left ventricular weight ratio was significantly higher in the postnatal repair group (0.71 +/- 0.01) than in both the intrauterine repair group (0.59 +/- 0.01) and normal lambs (0.59 +/- 0.01). The transverse myocyte diameter was not statistically different in all groups of animals and there were no ultrastructural changes even when the pulmonary stenosis was unrepaired. We conclude that intrauterine repair was more satisfactory than postnatal repair in terms of age-adjusted heart weight results, but we did not find any advantages of intrauterine repair in terms of histologic and ultrastructural changes.\r"

One death and four major complications occurred in these patients. Macroscopically radical resection was performed in 14 patients who are free of disease after 1 to 14 years. Debulking resection was performed in five patients: Three are alive after 5 to 11 years and two died after 36 and 40 months. Ten patients (seven with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and three with Hodgkin's disease) had residual mediastinal masses of more than 2 cm after chemotherapy; to assess the nature of the lesion (fibrosis or residual disease), we subjected these patients to surgical restaging of the mediastinum: Results were negative in seven and positive in three. We conclude that open biopsy is indispensable to obtain good tissue specimens suitable for histologic and immunohistochemical assessment. Biopsy must be performed as a major surgical procedure to avoid reoperation: Mediastinoscopy and sternal splitting incisions proved the most reliable approaches. Locally radical or debulking resection might be considered in selected cases to enhance long-term results.\r"

We compared the flow capacities of internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts under exercise conditions by means of radionuclide angiocardiography. Fifty-two patients were divided according to the type of bypass graft done to the left anterior descending artery: group 1 comprised 27 patients with the internal mammary artery graft, and group 2 included 25 patients with the saphenous vein graft. Saphenous vein grafts were placed into the right and circumflex systems. Before the operation, global and regional ejection fractions decreased similarly in both groups with exercise. After the operation, the global ejection fraction measured in groups 1 and 2 increased significantly from 54% +/- 2% to 57% +/- 2% and from 54% +/- 1% to 60% +/- 2%, respectively, the anteroseptal ejection fraction from 29% +/- 1% to 32% +/- 2% and from 29% +/- 1% to 35% +/- 1%, respectively, and the apical ejection fraction from 75% +/- 3% to 82% +/- 2% and from 77% +/- 2% to 86% +/- 2%, respectively. There were no differences in exercise-induced increases in the global and regional ejection fractions between groups 1 and 2. Six patients in group 1 had exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities at the anteroseptal and/or apical segments. In contrast, patients in group 2 had no exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities at these segments (p less than 0.05, group 1 versus group 2). Results of this study show that internal mammary artery grafts respond to the increased blood flow demand of exercise in essentially the same way as saphenous vein grafts. However, there seems to be a slightly greater potential for inadequate flow in patients with the internal mammary artery graft, as evidenced by the small group of patients with exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Comparison was made between the morphologic condition of the left anterior descending artery and four arterial conduits: the internal mammary, right gastroepiploic, inferior epigastric, and radial arteries, harvested from 17 patients (aged 15 to 85 years, mean 64 years) who had died of nonvascular diseases. Proximal, mid, and distal segments were examined microscopically. The internal mammary artery was elastic, but the others were muscular. In all four conduits, atherosclerosis was absent to mild, the internal elastic lamina showed only minimal defects, and the vasa vasorum were confined to the adventitia. In all cases the left anterior descending artery showed mild to severe atherosclerosis and substantial defects in the internal elastic lamina with penetration of the vasa vasorum into the media and intima. Comparison of the mean distance (+/- standard deviation) from the lumen to the outermost portion of the media for the left anterior descending artery (320 +/- 63 microns) with the four conduits gave comparable values for the internal mammary artery (350 +/- 92 microns); p = not significant) and the right gastroepiploic artery (291 +/- 109 microns; p = not significant), versus 529 +/- 52 microns; p less than 0.002) for the radial artery and 249 microns (+/- 87 microns) (p less than 0.04) for the inferior epigastric artery (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests). The relatively scanty presence of smooth muscle cells in the thin-walled media of the internal mammary artery combined with a well-formed internal elastic lamina, even at advanced age, may be an important cause for its low susceptibility to atherosclerosis and a major determinant in its superior long-term patency as a coronary artery bypass graft. This finding emphasizes the justification of continued use of the ideally matching internal mammary artery, either as in situ or free graft, in coronary artery bypass grafting. In contrast to the thick-walled radial artery, which may be relatively prone to ischemia, an acceptable long-term patency of the inferior epigastric artery and right gastroepiploic artery, if harvested as pedicled grafts, is anticipated.\r"

  ".W": "We performed myocardial revascularization with bilateral internal mammary arteries in eight children for coronary artery complications consequent to Kawasaki disease. Subjects included seven boys and one girl, ranging in age from 3 to 13 years (mean age, 8.3 +/- 3.4 years). The body surface area ranged from 0.65 to 1.65 m2 (average, 1.08 +/- 0.35 m2). Three patients had a previous myocardial infarction. The right internal mammary artery was anastomosed to the right coronary artery and the left internal mammary artery was sutured to the left anterior descending artery in all patients. The patients received an average of 2.4 grafts. Magnifying loupes of 3.5 X were used for anastomosis with 8-0 monofilament polypropylene sutures. Subjects were followed up from 12 to 38 months (23 +/- 10.8 months) after operation. All were doing well with no recurrence of angina, and body development was normal, including the sternum and thorax according to chest x-ray films and computed tomography of the chest. Patency of the bilateral internal mammary arteries was 100% in the early (within 1 month) postoperative period and remained so in the late (over 1 year) postoperative period. Anastomotic junctions between the internal mammary artery and the coronary artery developed well angiographically in the late postoperative period. The internal mammary artery is the graft of choice for pediatric myocardial revascularization because of its excellent long-term patency and growth potential. Bilateral internal mammary arteries should be used whenever indicated, and the use of bilateral internal mammary arteries did not adversely influence chest wall development in the children.\r"

  ".U": "90205158\r", 
  ".W": "Although left heart bypass has gained popularity as a powerful technique to assist the severely failed left heart, apparent right heart failure has often developed during the bypass procedure. We investigated whether the coexisting right heart failure is attributable to the left heart bypass in 16 open-chest dogs. We evaluated the effects of left heart bypass on the right ventricular systolic properties by the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and its effects on the diastolic properties by chamber compliance. Overall right ventricular performance was assessed by the end-diastolic pressure versus cardiac output relationship. The left heart bypass decreased the slope slightly when the assisted flow ratio exceeded 75% (-14% +/- 8% at the assisted flow ratio of 100%, p less than 0.02) and thus had a deleterious influence on right ventricular performance. The left heart bypass, on the other hand, had a counteracting beneficial influence on right ventricular performance through the increase in chamber compliance (38% +/- 5%, p less than 0.01) and the decrease in pulmonary arterial input resistance (-15% +/- 12%, p less than 0.01). The net effect of the left heart bypass was the increase in cardiac output (20% +/- 2%, p less than 0.05) for any given right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. We conclude that in normal hearts the left heart bypass augments right ventricular performance. We ascribe these beneficial effects to diastolic ventricular interdependence and afterload unloading.\r"

  ".W": "Extracorporeal circulation and hemoseparation may lead to coupled mechanical and chemical blood trauma and thus influence red cell deformability. Ten patients with coronary artery disease underwent coronary bypass. Patients' blood samples were drawn preoperatively, after extracorporeal circulation, and after hemoseparation. Ten healthy adults served as control subjects. Red blood cell deformability was determined by direct microscopic observation of red blood cells subjected to shear stresses of 1.2 to 13.3 Pa with a counter-rotating rheoscope. Red cell membrane proteins were separated by one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. At 1.2 Pa, preoperative red cell deformability was significantly greater in patients with coronary artery disease than in control subjects. Neither extracorporeal circulation nor hemoseparation changed red cell deformability significantly. Electrophoretic separation of membrane proteins failed to show any quantitative or qualitative differences between patients and control subjects. Moreover RBC membrane proteins of red blood cells in the patients were not altered as a result of extracorporeal circulation or hemoseparation. The preoperatively increased red cell deformability in the patients may be drug-induced. Our data suggest that the extracorporeal circulation and hemoseparation techniques used in this study do not lead to red blood cell damage.\r"

These patterns are characterized by morphologic and functional features which are elicited by careful examination and test procedures. Cutaneous cancer may result from exposure to nonionizing as well as ionizing radiation, to specific identifiable chemical hazards, and may be enhanced by trauma. Cutaneous hazards of chemical sources are largely found in the workplace and among consumer products, including drugs and toilet goods. Environmental skin diseases and injuries are preventable. Prior to use assessment for safety and for possible risks from exposure to an agent, product, or process is of primary importance in the prevention and control of environmental skin disease and injury.\r"

It has been shown that many neurotoxic agents produce a dose-related spectrum of impairment ranging from mild slowing of nerve conducting velocity or prolongation in reaction time to neuropathy and frank encephalopathy. Clinical manifestations are determined by the agent involved, by the dose of exposure, the vulnerability of the cellular target, the ability of the organism to metabolize and excrete the agent, and the ability to repair damage. An occupational history, including evaluation of evidence of specific agents and job history, is a critical component in the clinical management of individuals with suspect neurotoxic disease. Environmentally-induced disorders can be prevented by appropriate environmental controls. Prevention of neurotoxic disease is a complex process requiring continuous involvement of public health agencies and strong scientific research.\r"

Coronary arteriography was carried out within 72 h of thrombolysis. In the 42 patients with patent arteries after thrombolysis, the levels of thiobarbituric-acid-reactive material (TBA-RM), which reflects lipid peroxidation by free radicals, rose after streptokinase by 10.5 (SD 9.6) [corrected] nmol/g albumin, whereas in the 8 whose arteries remained occluded TBA-RM fell by 14.7 (8.0) [corrected] nmol/g albumin. There was no significant change in the 18:2 (9,11)/18:2 (9,12) molar ratio, an indicator of lipid isomerisation, either between the groups or after streptokinase. Thus, after successful thrombolysis there is a rise in lipid peroxidation, not seen in patients whose arteries remain occluded. This finding suggests free-radical-mediated damage at the time of reperfusion, and provides indirect evidence of reperfusion injury in man. This study provides evidence associating indicators of free radical activity with documented myocardial reperfusion in man.\r"

Thromboxane metabolite excretion correlated with mean arterial blood pressure, plasma lactate dehydrogenase, and platelet count which are indices of the severity of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Excretion of both metabolites fell rapidly post partum in parallel with resolution of clinical signs. Thus, increased thromboxane A2 biosynthesis correlates with disease severity and may have a pathogenetic role in pregnancy-induced hypertension. These findings provide a rationale for the use of aspirin in the treatment as well as in the prevention of this disorder.\r"
