  ".W": "A multifrequency calorimeter has been designed to measure the amplitude and time regime of the enthalpic fluctuations associated with structural or conformational transitions in biological macromolecular systems. The heat capacity function at constant pressure is directly proportional to the magnitude of the enthalpic fluctuations in a system. Biological macromolecules undergo thermally induced transitions of different kinds. Within the transition region, these systems exhibit relatively large enthalpy fluctuations that give rise to the characteristic peaks observed by conventional differential scanning calorimetry. The multifrequency calorimeter developed in this laboratory has been designed to measure the frequency spectrum of the enthalpy fluctuations, thus allowing us to estimate thermodynamic parameters as well as relaxation times. This information is obtained from the attenuation in the amplitude or phase-angle shift of the response of the system to a periodic temperature oscillation. This instrument has been used to study the gel-liquid crystalline transition of phosphatidylcholine bilayers. The frequency-temperature response surface for large dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles has been measured in the frequency range 0.04-1 Hz. The data are consistent with two enthalpic relaxation processes with time constants on the order of 3.8 s and 80 ms at the midpoint of the main gel-liquid crystalline transition.\r"

The replacement of a strictly conserved residue, Phe-31, by tyrosine or valine costs 1.8 and 5.1 kcal/mol, respectively, to the binding of the drug (1 cal = 4.184 J). In the case of the Phe31----Tyr mutation, the loss of the binding energy is due to the desolvation of the phenolic group; in the case of Phe31----Val mutation, it is mainly due to the loss of the interaction with the drug. The replacement of Leu-54 by glycine decreases the binding energy by 4.0 kcal/mol. A calculation on the mutation of Phe-31 to serine shows that the alteration could reduce the binding energy of methotrexate by 9.7 kcal/mol. The calculations clearly show that the hydrophobic interactions are as important as the hydrophilic ones in the binding of methotrexate.\r"

C., Hoy, C. & Schimke, R. T. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 5978-5982]. In the present study, murine tumor cells were exposed to severe hypoxia and then tested for their ability to form experimental metastases. Upon reoxygenation, cells transiently, yet dramatically, increased their metastatic potential. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that hypoxia and reoxygenation induced cell cycle perturbations and DNA overreplication in these tumor cell lines. Fibrosarcoma cells with overreplicated DNA isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting proved to be highly metastatic, although cells with 2-4 times the haploid DNA content in populations treated with hypoxia were also markedly more metastatic than oxic populations. These results support the hypothesis that hypoxic conditions existing in regions of solid tumors promote cellular heterogeneity and tumor progression.\r"

These subclones vary widely in basal and inducible quantities of VIP and its precursor mRNA and can be interconverted under specified culture conditions. Endogenous VIP immunoreactivity, detectable in all subclones, was lowest in the neuronal subclone SH-SY-5Y, whereas 15- to 25-fold higher levels were observed in the epithelial-appearing SH-EP and intermediate SH-IN subclones. Treatment with 10 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated VIP peptide levels approximately 5-fold in SH-SY-5Y cells but did not increase appreciably VIP levels in the other subclones. Treatment with 2.5 microM forskolin resulted in less than 50% stimulation of VIP expression in all subclones. Levels of mRNA encoding the VIP precursor generally paralleled these differences in VIP immunoreactivity. In cells transfected with the VIP/CAT fusion gene, CAT activity reflected closely these differences in basal VIP expression and the changes in response to PMA and forskolin. Deletion of 2.7 kb of the most upstream sequences resulted in an 80-90% reduction in basal CAT activity in SH-IN, but not SH-SY-5Y cells, and resulted in an 80% reduction in PMA stimulation in SH-SY-5Y cells. Deletion to within 74 nucleotides of the transcription start site resulted in CAT expression in SH-IN cells that was only 3% of that seen with the full 5.2-kb flanking sequences and further diminished the remaining PMA responsiveness in SH-SY-5Y cells. The data indicate that important cell-type-specific transcription regulatory sequences reside greater than 2.5 kb upstream from the VIP transcription start site.\r"

In the present study, we cultivated a pelleted mass of rabbit growth-plate chondrocytes in the presence of Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 micrograms of ascorbic acid per ml in a plastic centrifuge tube. These cells proliferated for several generations and then reorganized into a cartilage-like tissue that calcified without additional phosphate. The deposition of minerals was observed only after synthesis of a short-chain collagen and alkaline phosphatase. Serum factors were required for the increases in alkaline phosphatase and calcium contents. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine abolished the increases in uronic acid, alkaline phosphatase, and calcium contents. Transforming growth factor beta, at very low concentrations, suppressed the expression of the mineralization-related phenotype by chondrocytes. These results suggest that cartilage-matrix calcification can be controlled by growth factor(s) and that chondrocytes induce the mineralization of extracellular matrix when terminal differentiation is permitted in the absence of an artificial substrate.\r"

Central to the understanding of epithelial cell polarity is the question of how such cell-surface specializations are generated. A different class of membrane glycoproteins has recently emerged that may yield new insight into the mechanism underlying the biogenesis of this polarity. Members of this class contain a large extracellular protein domain linked to the membrane via glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol. Using a polarized renal epithelial cell line (Madin-Darby canine kidney), we identified endogenous glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins through release by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Six glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins of 110, 85, 70, 55, 38, and 35 kDa were identified and appeared to be restricted to the apical surface. Our data are consistent with the notion that the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor may contain the necessary information for \"targeting\" to the apical surface.\r"

RNA isolated from mouse liver was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system containing [35S]methionine, and the growth hormone receptor primary translation products were identified by immunoprecipitation with anti-mouse growth hormone receptor antiserum followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/PAGE and fluorography. Detectable amounts of the Mr 95,900 and 31,800 proteins were not present in in vitro-translated nonpregnant mouse liver mRNA. This result is consistent with previous observations of the up-regulation of growth hormone receptors in the liver during pregnancy in the mouse. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of mouse liver and adipose tissue RNA with a rabbit growth hormone receptor cDNA probe revealed two hybridizing mRNAs of approximately 3.9 and 1.2 kilobases. These two RNAs were greatly up-regulated in liver, but not in adipose tissue, during pregnancy. The sizes of these mRNAs closely matched predictions of the sizes of the mRNAs coding for the proteins of Mr 95,900 and 31,800 made by in vitro translation of size-fractionated late-pregnant mouse liver poly(A)+RNA. These results suggest a mechanism for the generation of both the heterogeneous forms of the growth hormone receptor identified in mouse liver membrane preparations and the mouse serum growth hormone-binding protein.\r"

We now extend those findings by demonstrating that rat embryo cells transfected with MYCN can proliferate for at least 200 generations. Isolation of established cells was dependent on high expression of MYCN and on biological selection to eliminate untransfected cells. The established cells were not tumorigenic in syngeneic rats or athymic mice, failed to grow in soft agar, and required relatively high concentrations of serum for proliferation in culture. Our results show that enhanced expression of MYCN can rescue normal cells from senescence, add to the credentials of MYCN as an authentic protooncogene, and identify an additional biological activity that can be used in the characterization of MYCN.\r"

We sought to determine the primary sequence of a nuclear pore protein modified by O-linked GlcNAc. The major (62 kDa) nuclear pore glycoprotein (np62) was purified from rat liver nuclear envelopes by immunoaffinity chromatography and preparative gel electrophoresis. After CNBr fragmentation, a glycopeptide was isolated and microsequenced. An oligonucleotide probe based on this sequence information was used to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from poly(A) mRNA of the rat thyroid cell line FRTL-5. A clone (B5) was isolated and shown to hybridize to a single 2.5-kilobase species in poly(A) mRNA from rat liver and FRTL-5. This insert was sequenced and found to contain a 691-base-pair cDNA encoding a 155-amino acid open reading frame. This open reading frame contained a CNBr fragment identical to the original glycopeptide sequence and a second CNBr fragment corresponding to a nonglycosylated peptide that was also isolated from the purified pore glycoprotein. The B5 cDNA produced a beta-galactosidase fusion protein of the size predicted by the open reading frame. Analysis of the residues making up a presumptive glycosylation site suggests that the sequence is unlike any known sites for enzymatic N- or O-linked glycosylation. The partial sequence of the 62-kDa nuclear pore glycoprotein shows little similarity to other characterized proteins and elucidates structural features of a member of the family of nuclear pore glycoproteins.\r"

  ".U": "89071745\r", 
  ".W": "During the terminal stage of skeletal myogenesis, myoblasts stop replicating, fuse to form multinucleate fibers, and express the genes that encode the proteins that convey contractile capacity. Because of this dramatic shift in proliferative state, morphology, and gene expression, it has been possible to readily identify and quantitate terminally differentiating myoblasts. In contrast, it is not clear whether the proliferating cells that give rise to postmitotic myoblasts are equally distinct in their phenotype and in fact whether distinct stages in skeletal myogenesis precede the onset of terminal differentiation. To address these questions, monoclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to determine that replicating myoblasts from newborn rats do express a muscle-specific phenotype. To identify replicating cells, incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into DNA was assayed by using anti-BrdUrd antibody. The developmentally regulated, muscle-specific, integral membrane protein H36 and the intermediate-filament protein desmin were scored as markers of the myogenic phenotype. The percentage of BrdUrd+ (i.e., proliferative) cells among H36+ and desmin+ myoblasts was equal to the percentage of BrdUrd+ cells in the entire population, indicating that the expression of H36 and desmin is uniformly characteristic of replicating myoblasts. Inhibition of protein synthesis before and during growth in BrdUrd did not alter the frequency of desmin and H36 immunofluorescence in BrdUrd+ cells. Thus, desmin and H36 were present in the replicating myoblasts prior to the onset of growth in BrdUrd. These results were confirmed using H36+ cells selected by flow cytometry: these purified H36+ myoblasts replicate, express desmin, and differentiate. Similar results were obtained with mouse myoblasts. Desmin expression in these mammalian cells differs from that in chicken embryo myoblasts: only a small proportion of replicating chicken embryo myoblasts express desmin. That replicating mammalian myoblasts have a muscle-specific phenotype serves to define a distinct stage in myogenic development and a specific cell in the myogenic lineage. Further, it implies that there is a regulatory event activated during myogenesis that precedes terminal differentiation and that is required for expression of those genes whose products distinguish the replicating myoblast.\r"

  ".W": "The rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) gene exhibits cell-specific as well as regional differences in its expression within the continuously regenerating small intestinal epithelium. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we linked portions of its 5' nontranscribed domain to the human growth hormone (hGH) gene and analyzed expression of the hGH reporter in transgenic mice by RNA blot, solution hybridization, and immunocytochemical techniques. Sequences located within 277 nucleotides of the start site of I-FABP transcription are sufficient to limit hGH expression to the intestine. Although the absolute levels of hGH mRNA in the duodenum and proximal jejunum of these transgenic mice were similar to those of I-FABP mRNA, steady-state hGH mRNA concentrations were approximately 100 times lower in their distal small intestine. Addition of nucleotides -278 to -1178 of the I-FABP gene \"restored\" hGH mRNA concentrations in the distal jejunum and ileum to levels comparable to murine I-FABP mRNA. Serum hGH levels were 1000 times lower in the \"short promoter\" transgenic mice compared to animals with the \"long promoter\" transgene, indicating that efficient distal small intestinal hGH expression is required to produce elevated hGH concentrations in serum. The distribution of hGH in villus-associated enterocytes and goblet cells and its lack of expression in the crypts of Lieberkuhn mimicked that of the endogenous I-FABP gene product in all transgenic pedigrees. However, bands of hGH-negative cells extending from the base to the tips of villi were frequently observed in mice that were heterozygous for the short promoter transgene. This mosaic staining was not observed for I-FABP. These data suggest that (i) different cis-acting sequences may be required for complete expression of proximal-distal I-FABP gradients than for recapitulation of its normal crypt-villus tip distribution; (ii) differences may exist in the export pathways of secreted proteins within enterocytes located in various regions of the small intestine; and (iii) there may be subtle genetic differences among various crypt stem cells that can be detected in vivo by observing mosaic patterns of transgene expression along the villus epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is detected in chicken brain as three polypeptides of 180 kDa, 140 kDa, and 120 kDa that arise from a single gene by alternative splicing. Heart tissue, however, contains components of 150 kDa, 140 kDa, and 130 kDa; neither the differences in molecular mass among these components nor the difference between neural and cardiac N-CAM could be accounted for by variations in glycosylation alone. A cDNA clone isolated from an embryonic chicken heart library, [lambda N101B, 1.8 kilobases (kb)] contained a 93-base-pair (bp) insert not found in neural N-CAM cDNAs. In the N-CAM gene this sequence mapped within a large region between exons 12 and 13 and was derived from four exons (12A-D) of 15, 33, 42, and 3 bp. Exons 12C and 12D together coded for 15 amino acids very similar to the second half of the muscle-specific insert (MSD1) found in N-CAM cDNA from human muscle cell cultures [Dickson, G., Gower, H. J., Barton, C. H., Prentice, H. M., Elsom, V. L., Moore, S. E., Cox, R. D., Quinn, C., Putt, W. & Walsh, F. S. (1987) Cell 50, 1119-1130]; the sequences of 12A and 12B, however, were much less similar to the corresponding region of the MSD1 sequence. Two oligonucleotides, one specific to exons 12A plus 12B and one specific to exon 12C both recognized mRNA species of 6.4 kb, 4.3 kb, and 3.0 kb in chicken cardiac and skeletal muscle and no mRNA species in smooth muscle or brain. The 3' end of clone lambda N101B contained a sequence coding for a potential phosphatidylinositol linkage signal as does the smallest form of brain N-CAM. In heart cell membranes only the 130-kDa N-CAM polypeptide was released by phospholipase C, suggesting that this form of N-CAM is encoded by clone lambda N101B. The other heart N-CAM species (150 kDa and 140 kDa) may be transmembrane forms that include the 12A-D (and possibly other) inserts. Tissue-specific forms of N-CAM can thus be formed by alternative use of multiple small exons that may alter the conformation of the extracellular region of the molecule. Differential use or switching of these small exons in conjunction with the differential expression of larger exons specifying regions associated with the cell membrane and cytoplasmic domains may signal key events in embryogenesis and histogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated and determined the DNA sequences of the human somatic cytochrome c gene (HCS) and 11 processed pseudogenes. HCS is the functional homologue to the previously characterized rat somatic gene because it correctly encodes the human heart protein, is present in single copy in the human genome, is nearly identical in both size and intron/exon structure to rodent somatic genes, and shares a high degree of sequence homology with its rat counterpart including a well-conserved promoter region (77% over 250 nucleotides). In contrast to the rodent system, however, where the known pseudogenes all originated from a locus encoding the present day cytochrome c, the human pseudogenes are of two types. A predominant class of older pseudogenes came from a progenitor of HCS that encoded an ancestral form of the protein, while a second group of only a few young pseudogenes originated from a recent parent of HCS that encoded the current cytochrome c polypeptide. These two distinct classes of human pseudogenes provide a molecular record of the history of cytochrome c evolution in primates and demarcate a short period of rapid evolution of the functional gene.\r"

  ".U": "89071749\r", 
  ".W": "Each coding sequence is a finite resource as to the number and composition of four bases. Accordingly, the excessive recurrence of one base oligomer entails the noticeable underrepresentation by the other, so that if the former is the same in most, if not all, of the coding sequences, the latter too must necessarily be the same in all. Indeed, a previous series of studies on 20-odd divergent coding sequences established CTG as one of the most frequently recurring base trimers (if not the most frequent), and this excess was compensated by the underrepresentation by CG and TA dimer-containing base trimers. In this study, I have analyzed three additional coding sequences and reanalyzed one previously studied coding sequence. These four, derived from man, a plant, and a fish, were of variously lopsided base compositions that were not at all conducive to high recurrences of either CT dimer or CT and TG. Yet, the excess of CT and TG dimers accompanied by complementary deficiency of CG and TA dimers emerged as the common rule. Thus, I propose the above as the universal rule of coding sequence construction. The underrepresentation by CG and TA dimers within coding sequences explains why regulatory signals in intergenic spacers are of two kinds: one, TA dimer rich; and the other, CG dimer rich.\r"

Meiotic recombination analysis of an interspecific mouse backcross indicated the following gene order and distances [in centimorgans (cM)]: centromere-Emv-1-(13 cM)-D4S76-(17 cM)-D5SC25-(5 cM)-alpha-casein-(1 cM)-beta- casein-(6 cM)-alpha-fetoprotein-(18 cM)-beta-glucuronidase. D5SC25, an anonymous locus defined by a mouse brain cDNA, maps near the map position of W and within the breakpoints of the presumed genetic deletion that causes the W19H phenotype. Southern analysis of DNAs of W19H/+ interspecific F1 hybrid mice and somatic cell hybrid lines carrying the W19H deletion chromosome showed the deletion of D5SC25. In fact, analysis of other mutations at or near the W locus, which had been transferred from the strain of origin for many backcross generations, revealed the retention of donor restriction fragment length polymorphisms at the D5SC25 locus. Such evidence confirms close linkage between D5SC25 and W (within 1 cM) and indicates that the D5SC25 cDNA clone could serve as a starting point in a chromosome \"walk\" to W and other closely linked loci that affect development.\r"

Virions produced from XC cells transfected with this hybrid provirus are infectious in cell culture and tumorigenic in BALB/cJ mice. A vector derived from this provirus, containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) and origins of replication from simian virus 40 and pBR322, is capable of transferring G418 resistance by virus infection in cell culture when supplied with viral proteins from either MMTV(C3H) or the hybrid MMTV.

A trisomic karyotype, diagnostic of Down syndrome, is readily detected in nonmitotic cells because the majority of their nuclei exhibit three discrete foci of hybridization, in contrast to normal diploid cells, which show two foci. Chromosomal translocations involving chromosome 21 sequences were also detected with these probes, and the intranuclear location of 21q22.3 DNA sequences in \"normal\" human brain neurons was established with the plasmid DNA probe set.

  ".W": "The temporal disappearance in human blood plasma of endogenous antioxidants in relation to the appearance of various classes of lipid hydroperoxides measured by HPLC postcolumn chemiluminescence detection has been investigated under two types of oxidizing conditions. Exposure of plasma to aqueous peroxyl radicals generated at a constant rate leads immediately to oxidation of endogenous ascorbate and sulfhydryl groups, followed by sequential depletion of bilirubin, urate, and alpha-tocopherol. Stimulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes in plasma initiates very rapid oxidation of ascorbate, followed by partial depletion of urate. Once ascorbate is consumed completely, micromolar concentrations of hydroperoxides of plasma phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters appear simultaneously, even though sulfhydryl groups, bilirubin, urate, and alpha-tocopherol are still present at high concentrations. Nonesterified fatty acids, the only lipid class in plasma not transported in lipoproteins but bound to albumin, are preserved from peroxidative damage even after complete oxidation of ascorbate, most likely due to site-specific antioxidant protection by albumin-bound bilirubin and possibly by albumin itself. Thus, in plasma ascorbate and, in a site-specific manner, bilirubin appear to be much more effective in protecting lipids from peroxidative damage by aqueous oxidants than all the other endogenous antioxidants. Hydroperoxides of linoleic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol added to plasma in the absence of added reducing substrates are degraded, in contrast to hydroperoxides of trilinolein and cholesterol linoleate. These findings indicate the presence of a selective peroxidase activity operative under physiological conditions. Our data suggest that in states of leukocyte activation and other types of acute or chronic oxidative stress such a simple regimen as controlled ascorbate supplementation could prove helpful in preventing formation of lipid hydroperoxides, some of which cannot be detoxified by endogenous plasma activities and thus might cause damage to critical targets.\r"

  ".U": "89071775\r", 
  ".W": "Familial defective apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 is a recently described genetic disorder that appears to result from a mutation in the apoB-100 gene. This disorder is characterized by hypercholesterolemia resulting from elevated plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein LDL. The disorder was first detected in three members of one family. The LDL from affected subjects binds defectively (approximately 30% of normal) to LDL receptors, retarding the clearance of LDL from plasma. In the present study, two other members of the affected family were found to possess abnormal LDL. In addition, abnormal LDL with a similar binding defect were found in a second, unrelated family. In both families, the defect is transmitted over three generations as an autosomal codominant trait and all affected members are heterozygotes. Since there is only one apoB-100 molecule per LDL particle, the abnormal LDL in heterozygous subjects is made up of two populations of particles: one that has normal binding activity to receptors and one that binds defectively. To localize the mutation in apoB-100, the binding of five apoB-100-specific monoclonal antibodies to abnormal LDL was assessed in a solid-phase RIA. Only antibody MB47, whose epitope is between residues 3350 and 3506, distinguished abnormal LDL from normal LDL isolated from control subjects with normal lipid levels; MB47 bound with a higher affinity (by approximately 60%) to abnormal LDL. In every individual with abnormal LDL, the MB47 antibody bound with a higher affinity. The convenience of this assay will facilitate screening of large populations to determine the frequency of this disorder.\r"

Analysis of their serum PEG-precipitable immune complexes as well as platelet acid eluates revealed the presence of anti-HIV-1 antibody existing as a complex that eluted in the void volume of a Sephadex G-200 gel-filtration column. The complex binds to washed normal platelets, whereas affinity-purified anti-HIV-1 (gp120) antibody does not. HIV-1 antigen or proviral DNA was not detectable in the immune complexes or platelet extracts. However, anti-antibodies directed against anti-HIV-1 antibody were detectable in the immune complexes as well as platelet eluates. Approximately 50% of eluted platelet IgG contained anti-HIV-1 antibody. Thus the markedly elevated platelet immunoglobulin is partly due to the presence of anti-HIV-1 antibody complexes.

Multilamellar and small unilamellar vesicles (MLVs and SUVs), composed of egg phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or its analog dihexadecylglycerophosphorylcholine (DHPC), and cholesterol plus phosphatidylserine, and containing 111In complexed to nitrilotriacetic acid, were injected intravenously in rats. Recovery of 111In-labeled liposomes in blood, liver, and spleen was assessed at specific time points after injection and the percentage of liposomes still intact in liver and spleen was determined by measurement of the time-integrated angular perturbation factor [G22(infinity)] of the 111In label. We found that MLVs but not SUVs, having DHPC as their bulk phospholipid, showed an increased resistance against lysosomal degradation as compared to other phospholipid-containing liposomes. The use of diacyl phospholipids with a high gel/liquid-crystalline phase-transition temperature, such as DPPC and DSPC, also retarded degradation of MLV, but not of SUV in the dose range tested, while the rate of uptake of these liposomes by the liver was lower.\r"

  ".U": "89071780\r", 
  ".W": "Results of studies of hypophysectomized rats suggest that growth hormone serves as a final common mediator through which gonadal steroids and other modifiers of pituitary function alter the expression of gender-specific liver genes such as the sexually dimorphic pair of cytochrome P-450 isozymes, male-specific P-450h and female-specific P-450i. We tested the effects of growth hormone in a system for primary monolayer culture of adult rat hepatocytes on a laminin-rich extracellular matrix (matrigel), which permits sustained expression of both constitutive and inducible liver genes in a chemically defined medium. Cultures of freshly isolated hepatocytes prepared from untreated male rats and samples of the intact donor liver contained readily detectable quantities of immunoreactive P-450h protein (measured on immunoblots of cell microsomes) and P-450h mRNA (measured on Northern blots of cellular RNA). Neither P-450i immunoreactive protein nor P-450i mRNA were present. Addition of physiologic concentrations of human or bovine growth hormone, but not of prolactin, to culture medium lacking insulin or other hormones resulted in prompt induction of P-450i immunoreactive protein and P-450i mRNA. Induction of P-450i mRNA in male hepatocyte cultures was dependent on the concentration of growth hormone, required as little as 24 hr of exposure, and was markedly attenuated in cultures maintained on type I collagen rather than on matrigel. Growth hormone treatment also induced the level of mRNA for insulin-like growth factor I, whereas the amount of mRNA for the male-specific urinary protein alpha 2 mu-globulin was unaffected. Cultures of hepatocytes derived from untreated adult female rats retained high levels of P-450i mRNA but only if the culture medium contained growth hormone. None of the tested treatments with estrogens, androgens, glucocorticoids, or growth hormone induced P-450h mRNA or P-450h immunoreactive protein in cultures of female hepatocytes. We conclude that the somatogenic effects of growth hormone acting alone and directly on the hepatocyte in culture are sufficient to \"feminize\" the cytochrome P-450 phenotype. The present culture system offers a way to explore the molecular basis for hormonal control of liver gene expression.\r"

Other amines for which significant differences between smokers and nonsmokers were observed were 3-aminobiphenyl, 2-naphthylamine, o- and p-toluidine, 2,4-dimethylaniline, and 2-ethylaniline. Some of these amines are human bladder carcinogens, and their occurrence in blood as hemoglobin adducts is evidence for their metabolic activation. Thus, by a combination of traditional epidemiological methods and modern chemical analyses, we have provided evidence for a biochemical basis for the often observed association between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Transgenic mouse strains carrying Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) in the germ line were found to serve as rapid and quantitative models of in utero and perinatal retroviral infection for evaluating strategies of antiretroviral therapy. In these strains virus activation leads to virus expression, viral spread associated with the development of viremia, and subsequent T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. To test these transgenic strains for their usefulness in evaluating antiretroviral agents, the effect of the drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) on the development of viremia and subsequent disease was examined. The assessment of mice for viremia at 1 month of age appeared to be the most useful assay because it was rapid and quantitative. AZT was most effective in preventing viremia in transgenic strains that activate Mo-MuLV after birth and had more variable effects in strains that activate prior to birth. However, in six of seven of the strains examined, AZT led to a marked improvement in survival and reduced the onset of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. These results provide evidence for effective antiretroviral therapy during gestation and in the perinatal period and are of potential significance for the management of the maternal transmission of human retroviruses.\r"

The BZLF1 open reading frame, present within WZhet as well as in the standard viral BamHI Z fragment, encodes the protein ZEBRA, which induces viral replication. Using gene transfers into Burkitt lymphoma cells, we now demonstrate that rearranged sequences juxtaposed to BZLF1 in het DNA facilitate expression of ZEBRA protein. Two stretches of EBV sequences within a palindromic region of het DNA contain positive regulatory elements. One set, derived from the viral large internal repeat, is newly positioned upstream of BZLF1; the second set is downstream of BZLF1 in het DNA. The capacity of defective HR-1 viruses to disrupt latency of the standard EBV genome is due to abnormal regulation of the BZLF1 gene as a result of genomic rearrangements.\r"

The firing rates from single antennal neurons on Agrotis segetum antennae decreased to nearly zero within seconds after the antennae were placed in a pheromone plume 70 cm downwind of a high-concentration source known from previous studies to cause in-flight arrestment of upwind progress. In a separate experiment, the fluctuating output from chilled neurons on Grapholita molesta antennae became attenuated in response to repetitive, experimentally delivered pheromone pulses. The attenuation was correlated with a previously reported higher percentage of in-flight arrestment exhibited by moths flying at cooler compared to warmer temperatures. These results indicate that two peripheral processes related to excessive concentration, complete adaptation of antennal neurons, or merely the attenuation of fluctuations in burst frequency, are important determinants of when upwind progress by a moth flying in a pheromone plume stops and changes to station keeping. Also, adaptation and attenuation may affect the sensation of blend quality by preferentially affecting cells sensitive to the most abundant components in airborne pheromone blends.\r"

Fetal rat src mRNA levels were much higher in the central nervous system than any peripheral organ. In adult brain, src+ mRNA level was highest in the internal granular layer of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and cerebellar granule cells. src+ and src- levels were similar in hindbrain, but src+ levels were higher than those of src- in forebrain.

Neurochemical lesions of the nucleus basalis-medial septal area in rats impaired choice accuracy on a delayed alternation t-maze task. Acetylcholine (7.5 or 10 micrograms intraventricularly or 1 micrograms micro-injected into the ventral hippocampus) significantly improved performance in the lesioned rats. Atropine (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally or 10 micrograms intraventricularly), but not mecamylamine (3 mg/kg intraperitoneally or 20 micrograms intraventricularly), blocked this action of acetylcholine, suggesting involvement of a muscarinic receptor. Galanin (100-500 ng intraventricularly or 200 ng into the ventral hippocampus) attenuated the ability of acetylcholine to reverse the deficit in working memory in the lesioned rats. The antagonistic interaction between galanin and acetylcholine suggests that endogenous galanin may inhibit cholinergic function in memory processes, particularly in pathologies such as Alzheimer disease that involve degeneration of basal forebrain neurons.\r"

L-Glutamate uptake could be observed as early as 24 hr after injection, was linearly related to the quantity of mRNA injected, and could be induced after injection of as little as 1 ng of cerebellar mRNA. Transport of radiolabeled L-glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine, dopamine, serotonin, and choline could be measured in single microinjected oocytes with a regional profile consistent with the anatomical distribution of particular neurotransmitter synthesizing soma. Forebrain L-glutamate and dopamine uptake, as well as cerebellar L-glutamate transport, were found to be Na+-dependent. Cerebellar mRNA-induced L-glutamate transport was both time and temperature-dependent, was saturable by substrate, suggesting a single activity with an apparent transport Km of 14.2 microM and a Vmax of 15.2 pmol/hr per oocyte, and was sensitive to inhibitors of brain L-glutamate transport. Thus, the oocyte L-glutamate transport induced by injection of adult rat cerebellar mRNA appears essentially identical to the high-affinity, Na+-dependent L-glutamate uptake found in brain slices and nerve terminals. Experiments with size-fractionated cerebellar mRNA reveal single, comigrating peaks for cerebellar L-glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid transport, with peak activity obtained in fractions of approximately 2.7 kilobases, suggesting the presence of single or similarly sized mRNAs encoding each of these activities.\r"

  ".U": "89071796\r", 
  ".W": "The role of the neuropeptide galanin in the regulation of anterior pituitary function was studied in vivo in conscious male rats and in vitro with cultured anterior pituitary cells. Galanin (50-200 ng; 15-60 pmol) injected into the third cerebral ventricle of rats produced highly significant, dose-related increases of plasma growth hormone (GH) concentrations, whereas galanin increased prolactin (PRL) and decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels only at the highest dose (60 pmol) tested. Intravenous galanin failed to alter PRL and TSH levels in these rats. In contrast with the results with intraventricular injection of the peptide, intravenous injection of 30 or 300 pmol of galanin produced small, brief, dose-related increases in plasma GH. The response to the 300-pmol dose was less than that induced by a factor-of-20-lower intraventricular dose, which establishes a central action of galanin. Galanin in concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 1 microM failed to alter significantly GH, PRL, or TSH release from dispersed anterior pituitary cells. It also failed to alter GH secretion in response to 100 nM GH-releasing hormone; however, at this dose galanin did potentiate the effect of 100 nM TSH-releasing hormone on TSH and PRL release. Thus, the effects of third-ventricular injection of the peptide are mediated by the hypothalamus. To determine the physiological significance of galanin in control of pituitary hormone release, highly specific antiserum against galanin was injected intraventricularly. Third-ventricular injection of 3 microliter of galanin antiserum resulted in a dramatic decrease in plasma GH values as compared with those of normal rabbit serum-injected controls within 15 min, which persisted until the end of the experiment (5 hr postinjection). Galanin antiserum did not decrease plasma PRL or TSH levels at any time period after its third-ventricular injection; however, a transient increase of plasma TSH levels occurred after 30 and 60 min in comparison with TSH levels in normal rabbit serum-injected controls. Since there was no effect of the antiserum on plasma PRL and only a transient elevation in TSH, galanin may not be physiologically significant enough during resting conditions to alter PRL and TSH release in the male rat. The results of the experiments with galanin antiserum indicate that endogenous galanin has a tonic action within the hypothalamus to stimulate GH release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89071797\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that the brain peptide neurotensin can stimulate prolactin release by direct action on the pituitary gland, whereas its action within the hypothalamus is inhibitory. The inhibitory action is mediated by the release of dopamine into the hypophyseal portal veins, which deliver the neurotransmitter to the anterior pituitary gland to inhibit prolactin release. Our experiments were done to evaluate the physiologic significance of these neurotensin actions by injecting the globulin fraction of highly specific neurotensin antiserum either intravenously or intraventricularly. Injection into the third ventricle of either 1 or 3 microliter of neurotensin antiserum significantly increased plasma prolactin concentrations in (i) ovariectomized and (ii) ovariectomized estrogen- and progesterone-primed rats within 1 hr of injection. The response was more pronounced in the ovariectomized than in the ovariectomized estrogen- and progesterone-treated animals and was dose related. Intraventricular injection of these doses of neurotensin antiserum also evoked elevations in plasma prolactin in intact males, which were significant but smaller in magnitude than those seen in female rats. To evaluate the effect of the antiserum on the pituitary directly, the antiserum was injected intravenously at a dose of 40 microliter, which was sufficient to block the blood pressure-lowering effect of neurotensin. After the intravenous injection of antiserum, a highly significant suppression of plasma prolactin occurred, detectable when first measured at 1 hr after injection in both ovariectomized and ovariectomized estrogen- and progesterone-treated animals; however, the intravenous injection of antiserum had no significant effect on the prolactin release in males. These data indicate the physiological significance of the hypothalamic inhibitory actions of neurotensin on prolactin release, which are probably mediated by its stimulation of dopamine release that in turn, inhibits prolactin secretion by the lactotropes. The direct stimulatory effect of the peptide on prolactin release after its presumed release into portal vessels also appears to be physiologically significant in female but not in male rats.\r"

Females from this population were allowed to produce offspring from their matings in nature. They were then remated to males from a laboratory strain and again allowed to produce offspring. Offspring were also produced from matings of males from nature to laboratory females. Diagnosis of salivary chromosomes in these several sets of larval offspring allowed us to deduce the karyotypes of adult females and males from nature as well as the karyotypes of the offspring of these females by their matings in nature. We reason that the males collected with the females are a reasonable sample of those that mated the females and deposited the sperm they carried on capture. Chromosome frequencies in the offspring of wild females by their matings in nature were decomposed into male and female parental contributions. Changes in chromosome frequency due to male mating success were calculated by comparing chromosomal frequencies in adult males with those in the chromosomes they contributed to their offspring. These changes were sizable and provide direct evidence that male sexual selection is an important component of selection on the inversions in this natural population. We proceeded further to classify karyotypes on the basis of their frequencies and to calculate the fraction of offspring fathered by rare or common males. Rare male karyotypes as a group had a selective value nearly twice that of the common male karyotypes.\r"

Patients undergoing reconstruction ranged from 1 to 10 months of age and 3 to 7 kg in weight. All reconstructed patients underwent bilateral pectoralis major advancement flaps, with three of the five patients each requiring the simultaneous use of a rectus abdominis flap. With 2 to 18 months of follow-up, healing was complete in all five of the reconstructed patients, with two prosthetic pulmonary-systemic shunts and two outflow tract patches thus salvaged. These patients were found to be distinct from their adult counterparts, with special critical care requirements and expectedly delicate muscular anatomy. The gratifying results now expected in adults with sternal wound complications can be achieved in their infant counterparts. Furthermore, the group of patients whose chests cannot initially be closed owing to resultant cardiac compression may look to sternocostal debridement and flap reconstruction as a means of not only achieving wound closure, but of effectively increasing their mediastinal volume and compliance. Questions about skeletal development remain unanswered and demand further follow-up.\r"

We used the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum superficialis to cover exposed Gore-Tex grafts in nine patients. The sublimis was used to cover distal graft exposures, and the longer flexor carpi ulnaris muscle was used to cover more proximal sites. Multiple exposures required both flaps or combinations of muscle flaps and local rotation flaps. Eight of nine chronically exposed grafts were salvaged using these techniques; a graft was removed from one patient because of diffuse unrecognized graft bed infection. Disability is minimized by using only part of the sublimis, and loss of the flexor carpi ulnaris is compensated by local muscles with similar actions. Vascular puncture can be continued during healing.\r"

Wide resection of the middle third of the face, orbit, and palate requires \"complex\" three-dimensional volume reconstruction, whereas extensive defects of the scalp and skull (exceeding 80 cm2) require coverage of the larger surface area soft-tissue defect and the exposed brain and dura. The latissimus dorsi free-muscle flap and split-thickness skin graft have become our methods of choice for extensive scalp and skull defects. The latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous free flap is preferable for reconstruction of complex palatal and external skin and orbital defects of the middle third of the face. Microsurgical free-tissue transfer reliably frees the oncologic surgeon from the constraints imposed by conventional reconstructive techniques and may therefore allow improved curative or at least palliative resection of these extensive tumors.\r"

Ninety-seven percent of the dermoids were found in the temporal half of the globe; of these, 76 percent were in the inferolateral quadrant, straddling the corneoscleral limbus. The majority of children had an oblique astigmatism in the involved eye. Epibulbar dermoids may be removed by careful superficial keratectomy, but caution should be exerted in excising lipodermoids because of the risks of affecting ocular motility and tear secretion.\r"

Primarily owing to the markedly increased exposure with this technique, more accurate assessment of the deformities is possible and additional or improved surgical maneuvers become available, particularly in the tip. Sculpting the entire cartilaginous and/or bony vault, as well as correcting difficult septal malalignments, can be carried out under better direct vision with greater precision, accuracy, and predictability. This has led to improved and more consistent final results. Previous criticisms of unsightly columellar scars have been virtually eliminated through the use of improved surgical techniques and simple magnification. Overall, open rhinoplasty technique can provide many distinct advantages in certain nasal deformities with no real disadvantages over conventional closed techniques.\r"

The entire lattisimus dorsi muscle, including the fascial portion, safely carried an island of skin from the area of the lumbodorsal fascia to the contralateral axilla. The flap was transposed to the defect through a tunnel between the pectoralis major and minor muscles. Most patients who needed reconstruction of the chest wall and axilla had compromised ipsilateral vasculature that prohibited its use in a pedicled flap but had an intact contralateral chest wall, axilla, and thoracodorsal vessels. Therefore, this procedure was performed easily in comparison with a free flap or pedicled omental flap. This is a new, valuable application for the versatile latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap.\r"

Arteriography in 29 patients demonstrated occlusion of the artery of the small kidney, and in 28 there was stenosis. In addition, 25 patients had stenosis of the artery supplying the larger contralateral kidney. Stenosis of the arteries of the contralateral kidneys was dilated by percutaneous transluminal arterioplasty in all but one of the 25 patients with bilateral disease of the artery, stenosis of the small kidney could be dilated successfully by percutaneous transluminal arterioplasty in 22 of the 28 patients, and cure or improvement of blood pressure was achieved in 12 of them. Percutaneous transluminal arterioplasty of occluded arteries was generally unsuccessful. In 17 patients with unilateral disease not manageable by percutaneous transluminal arterioplasty, nephrectomy of the small kidney improved blood pressure control without significant deterioration of renal function. Renal function improved in 10 patients with bilateral lesions treated by nephrectomy of the small kidney in combination with contralateral percutaneous transluminal arterioplasty. Histological examination of excised kidneys showed large infarcts or several cholesterol emboli whether percutaneous transluminal arterioplasty had been attempted or not. After observation periods ranging from two to 79 months, 48 patients were normotensive (21 without and 27 with medication) and nine patients were still hypertensive even with medication. This study showed that by using percutaneous transluminal arterioplasty initially if possible, supplemented with nephrectomy and/or medication, normotension without loss of renal function or immediate serious complications could be obtained in the majority of these severely hypertensive patients.\r"

We present follow up data on 209 patients; the period from the original illness to December 1985 or death was between two and 73 years (mean 33.9). One hundred and sixty-three (78 per cent) patients developed late functional deterioration. This was due to purely respiratory factors in 99 cases, new neurological signs in 20 cases, and orthopaedic problems in 17 cases; 31 patients deteriorated due to a combination of factors. The commonest cause of respiratory deterioration was the development of nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation, sometimes associated with late progressive scoliosis. Eighty-six patients needed respiratory support beginning between one year and 66 years (mean 28.5) after the acute illness. New neurological signs had a clearly defined cause in each of 20 patients. No cases of motor neurone disease or post-poliomyelitis muscular atrophy (PPMA) were identified. This series shows that late sequelae following poliomyelitis are common. There were no patients with functional deterioration after poliomyelitis in whom a clear underlying cause could not be shown. The major causes of deterioration may be treatable or avoidable, and in particular, those who develop chest infections or new respiratory symptoms should be treated with caution as respiratory failure may rapidly supervene.\r"

  ".W": "The results of renovascular surgery for renovascular hypertension are influenced markedly by patient selection. Our method of patient selection was based primarily on clinical characteristics rather than functional tests. To determine its effect on the results obtained by surgery, we studied all 115 patients in whom angiography showed that surgery had eliminated the renal artery stenosis. Six to 12 months after the operation, hypertension was cured or improved in 83 per cent of the patients and 17 per cent were classified as treatment failures. The results obtained for patients with stenosis caused by arteriosclerosis were similar to those found for patients with fibrodysplasia. Clinical characteristics (sex, blood pressure, duration of hypertension, creatinine level and extrarenal arteriosclerosis or target organ damage before surgery) were analysed separately. The characteristics of patients with a beneficial blood pressure response were not significantly different from those of patients who failed to respond, except for the blood pressure level itself. On the basis of our findings and the results of functional tests reported in the literature, we conclude that the decision to operate should be based on all of the clinical data available. Functional tests can be used to support the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in selected patients. The presence of extrarenal arteriosclerosis before surgery is not associated with a poorer chance of a beneficial blood pressure response.\r"

  ".U": "89072708\r", 
  ".W": "Erythropoietin (Epo), the hormone that stimulates red blood cell production, is synthesized in the kidney and liver in response to hypoxia. The human hepatoma cell line Hep3B regulates its production of Epo in a physiologic manner. Either hypoxia or cobalt chloride markedly increases expression of Epo mRNA as well as production of biologically active and immunologically distinct Epo protein. New protein synthesis is required before the induction of increased levels of hypoxia- or cobalt-induced Epo mRNA. Hypoxia, cobalt chloride, and nickel chloride appear to stimulate Epo production through a common pathway. The inhibition of Epo production at low partial pressures of oxygen by carbon monoxide provides evidence that a heme protein is integrally involved in the oxygen-sensing mechanism. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that when heme synthesis is blocked, hypoxia-, cobalt-, and nickel-induced Epo production are all markedly inhibited. A model is proposed in which a ligand-dependent conformational change in a heme protein accounts for the mechanism by which hypoxia as well as cobalt and nickel stimulate the production of Epo.\r"

A placental lambda gt11 library was screened for expression of specific CRE-binding proteins with the CRE sequence as a radioactive probe. A cDNA encoding a protein of 326 amino acids with the binding properties of a specific CRE-binding protein (CREB) was isolated. The protein contains a COOH-terminal basic region adjacent to a sequence similar to the \"leucine zipper\" sequence believed to be involved in DNA binding and in protein-protein contacts in several other DNA-associated transcriptional proteins including the products of the c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun oncogenes and GCN4. The CREB protein also contains an NH2-terminal acidic region proposed to be a potential transcriptional activation domain. The putative DNA-binding domain of CREB is structurally similar to the corresponding domains in the phorbol ester-responsive c-jun protein and the yeast transcription factor GCN4.\r"

Many cells in the medial geniculate nucleus are then visually driven, have large receptive fields, and receive input from retinal ganglion cells with small somata and slow conduction velocities. Visual cells with long conduction latencies and large contralateral receptive fields can also be recorded in primary auditory cortex. Some visual cells in auditory cortex are direction selective or have oriented receptive fields that resemble those of complex cells in primary visual cortex. Thus, functional visual projections can be routed into nonvisual structures in higher mammals, suggesting that the modality of a sensory thalamic nucleus or cortical area may be specified by its inputs during development.\r"

The channel underwent a fast rundown in less than 2 to 3 minutes of recording, and reactivation required in situ exposure to a phosphorylating \"cocktail\" containing the catalytic subunit of the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase. Mean open time and open probability were increased after phosphorylation, whereas slope conductance remained unchanged. Thus, metabolic control of tracheal chloride single channels can now be studied in vitro.\r"

These unexpected observations are discussed in the context of lipid anchor biosynthesis.\r"

Amino acid sequence has been derived from a highly purified preparation of BMP from bovine bone. Now, human complementary DNA clones corresponding to three polypeptides present in this BMP preparation have been isolated, and expression of the recombinant human proteins have been obtained. Each of the three (BMP-1, BMP-2A, and BMP-3) appears to be independently capable of inducing the formation of cartilage in vivo. Two of the encoded proteins (BMP-2A and BMP-3) are new members of the TGF-beta supergene family, while the third, BMP-1, appears to be a novel regulatory molecule.\r"

  ".W": "A novel method has been developed for modulating the expression of an endogenous chromosomal gene in a higher eukaryote, by competitive inhibition at the level of gene transcription. The gene studied was the hsp70 gene, which encodes a 72-kilodalton (kD) heat shock protein that is synthesized after thermal stress. The 5' control region of the hsp70 gene was inserted on a plasmid containing the eukaryotic gene for dihydrofolate reductase. The hybrid plasmid was then introduced into a Chinese hamster ovary cell line and elevated in copy number approximately 20,000-fold by selection of cells with methotrexate. Heat-inducible expression from the intact hsp70 gene was reduced by at least 90% in the modified cells when compared with the induction in control cells, and the modified cells also displayed elevated thermosensitivity. The change in heat shock protein synthesis is presumably caused by competition among the increased number of binding sites for the heat-shock transcription factor, leading to altered expression from the native heat shock gene. These results support a role for heat shock protein in the recovery of mammalian cells from acute thermal stress.\r"

  ".W": "The development of electrophysiological properties of isolated, identified ascidian blastomeres was followed from the fertilized egg to the neurula, and the stage at which cells of different lineages first express different functional ion channel populations was determined. Little has been known about such events because of the difficulties of making voltage-clamp recordings from small embryonic cells and of identifying their developmental fates in dissociated preparations. The problem of small cell size was circumvented by using the whole-cell patch clamp, and identification was facilitated by the use of a species of ascidian, Boltenia villosa, in which endogenous pigment marks cells of specific developmental fates. Within approximately 3 hours after gastrulation, muscle-lineage blastomeres in these embryos developed a voltage-dependent calcium current while surrounding blastomeres of other lineages did not. At about the same time, all cells developed delayed outward potassium currents and lost the inwardly rectifying potassium currents present at earlier stages.\r"

The grafted cells survived and produced sufficient NGF to prevent the degeneration of cholinergic neurons that would die without treatment. In addition, the protected cholinergic cells sprouted axons that projected in the direction of the cellular source of NGF. These results indicate that a combination of gene transfer and intracerebral grafting may provide an effective treatment for some disorders of the central nervous system.\r"

As the number of serines decreased, there were decreases in the residence time and consequently the equilibrium binding affinity of QX-222, a quaternary ammonium anesthetic derivative thought to bind within the open channel. Receptors with three serine-to-alanine mutations also displayed a selective decrease in outward single-channel currents. Both the direction of this rectification and the voltage dependence of QX-222 blockade suggest that the residues mutated are within the aqueous pore of the receptor and near its cytoplasmic (inner) surface.\r"

The messenger RNA of this GAP was detected in human lung, brain, liver, leukocytes, and placenta. The second type appeared to be generated by a differential splicing mechanism and encoded a novel form of GAP with a predicted molecular mass of 100,400 daltons. This protein lacks the hydrophobic amino terminus characteristic of the larger species, but retains GAP activity. The messenger RNA of this type was abundantly expressed in placenta and in several human cell lines, but not in adult tissues.\r"

Two families with affected children homozygous for this autosomal recessive disorder were studied for abnormalities in the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its gene. Although the receptor displays normal binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 hormone, VDR from affected family members has a decreased affinity for DNA. Genomic DNA isolated from these families was subjected to oligonucleotide-primed DNA amplification, and each of the nine exons encoding the receptor protein was sequenced for a genetic mutation. In each family, a different single nucleotide mutation was found in the DNA binding domain of the protein; one family near the tip of the first zinc finger (Gly----Asp) and one at the tip of the second zinc finger (Arg----Gly). The mutant residues were created in vitro by oligonucleotide directed point mutagenesis of wild-type VDR complementary DNA and this cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells. The produced protein is biochemically indistinguishable from the receptor isolated from patients.\r"

The final diagnosis was appendicitis in 24 and abdominal pain not necessitating operation in the remaining 30. Two hundred two laboratory tests were obtained (average 3.7 tests per patient). The mean white blood cell count on initial CBC was 13,930/cu mm overall with a higher mean in the appendicitis group (16,704 vs 11,057/cu mm). Of the 148 tests besides CBC, only 12 (8%) yielded abnormal results; all of these were present on urinalysis and were nondiagnostic. A total of 117 roentgenograms were obtained on initial evaluation (average 2.2 x-ray films per patient). Films were considered abnormal by the ordering physician in 12 cases (24%). When reviewed by the radiologist, 17 abnormalities (33%) were detected. In only seven instances was there agreement in interpretation of abnormality between the ordering physician and the radiologist. This review indicates little usefulness of nonspecific laboratory and radiologic evaluation of possible appendicitis in children. Appendicitis remains a diagnosis of physical examination, and early referral with thorough evaluation by an experienced examiner may result not only in improved accuracy, but in less delay in appropriate therapy, with greater cost effectiveness.\r"

There was no significant difference in the incidence of chromosome abnormalities in those couples having two losses as compared with those having three or more losses. The study couples were referred from a wide range of sources, and most women had not had extensive gynecologic evaluation. These results confirm the importance of cytogenetic analysis of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss, and suggest that such studies be considered after two losses.\r"

Many of these cases are hunting accidents in which safety glasses could have prevented or lessened ocular damage. To evaluate the effectiveness of various types of safety glasses, we fired a Remington automatic shotgun at mannequin heads fitted with one of four types of safety lenses. From a distance of 10 yards, only polycarbonate lenses provided even partial protection. At 30 yards, polycarbonate and heat-treated lenses provided the best protection, whereas chemically treated and CR39 lenses provided significantly less protection. We recommend that hunters using shotguns in areas of poor visibility wear widely available polycarbonate safety glasses as well as \"hunter's orange\" to minimize their risk of devastating ocular gunshot injury.\r"

We prospectively studied the effectiveness of a reminder system to improve screening by Pap smear, rectal examination with stool guaiac test, breast examination, and pneumococcal vaccine administration in two resident outpatient clinics. Performance of these preventive health measures was determined during a six-week baseline period and again after five months of chart reminders to residents in one clinic, and after six months without reminders. For the intervention, a physician's assistant screened each chart and attached a reminder to the front indicating which procedures were overdue based on published recommendations. Health screening behavior was not significantly different between the two resident clinics during baseline. After the five-month reminder intervention, residents in both groups moderately increased their preventive health activities over baseline; however, only the reminded group showed significant improvement (chi 2 = 11.60, P less than .001). Six months after remainders were discontinued there was no difference in overall performance between the two clinics (chi 2 = 2.79, NS). The reminded group did preserve its significant improvement over the baseline phase (chi 2 = 6.12, P less than .01). This simple reminder system had a modest but statistically significant positive impact on health screening behavior. Despite this improvement, absolute rates of screening remained below 50% in both clinics.\r"

Both children had satisfactory long-term results after reconstruction with an isoperistaltic pouch.

A model for intravascular thrombosis in the rat common carotid artery was established using a combination of balloon catheter endothelial injury with 1-hour occlusion of the vessel. After endothelial injury in 11 Sprague-Dawley rats, the adventitial surface of the carotid artery was exposed to the polymer polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) containing heparin and was compared with exposure to PVA alone in the contralateral (control) vessel. Subsequent determinations of the coagulation parameters systemic prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times showed no systemic effect of heparin. All 11 control vessels demonstrated complete or partial thrombosis, whereas only one of 11 heparin/PVA-treated vessels showed a small thrombus. Morphometric analysis of the cross-sectional thrombus: lumen ratio in 10 rats showed a significant reduction (p less than 0.005) in thrombus size for treated vessels (4.1 +/- 9.6%) compared with control vessels (60.2 +/- 25.8%). Scanning electron microscopy verified the absence of thrombus in the treated vessels despite complete endothelial desquamation. In a second group of eight rats, endothelial injury without occlusion did not cause thrombosis in treated or control arteries. The coagulation parameters for this group of eight unoccluded rats were similarly unaffected by heparin/PVA treatment. Our observations suggest that a localized antithrombotic effect of heparin can be achieved without systemic anticoagulation using a polymeric drug delivery system. This technique may be applied to a variety of surgical and nonsurgical clinical conditions.\r"

Thirty-three percent of the 90 seizures appeared early (within 2 weeks after the infarction), and 90% of the 30 early seizures appeared within 24 hours after the infarction. Seventy-three percent of the 90 seizures occurred within the first year, and only 2% occurred greater than 2 years after the infarction. Fifty-six percent of the 90 seizures were single, and status epilepticus was seen in only 8%. Early-onset seizures were more likely to be partial (57% of 30); late-onset seizures were more likely to be generalized (65% of 60). Thirty-nine percent of the 90 initial seizures recurred, and there was no significant difference in recurrence rate between early- or late-onset initial seizures. Twenty-two percent of the 90 initial seizures became multiple recurrent seizures, and we could identify a precipitating factor in 86% of the 35 recurrent seizures. The most common electroencephalographic abnormality in the 61 patients so examined was focal slowing (61%), but recurrent seizures occurred in 100% of the four patients with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and in 75% of the eight patients with diffuse slowing. Computed tomography in 61 patients showed that large infarctions were associated with early (p less than 0.021) and multiple (p less than 0.05) seizures. Deep infarctions on computed tomograms (cortical infarctions extending to subcortical structures) tended to cause recurrent seizures (p less than 0.057). Seizures in 88% of the 90 patients could be managed with monotherapy.\r"

Over 4 years, 138 carotid endarterectomies were performed in the 118 patients, 63 operations with intraluminal shunting and 75 without. Standard rationale for surgery included ipsilateral cerebral infarction in 38% of the operations and ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks in 36%. Unilateral angiographic stenosis of greater than 90% was seen in 58% of the operations; there were no ipsilateral occlusions. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia with barbiturate induction and mild blood pressure elevation. The 30-day complication rate included a mortality rate of 0.7% with a 5.1% incidence of postoperative neurologic deficit and a 1.4% rate of myocardial infarction. In the 24 hours after surgery there were no cerebral infarctions in the shunted group and six in the unshunted group. This 8% rate in the unshunted group compared with 0% in the shunted group was significant at p = 0.023 with a power of 0.95 by Fisher's exact test and chi 2 analysis. This suggests that in our neurosurgical practice (resident training program) the use of an intraluminal shunt during carotid endarterectomy significantly reduces the risk of intraoperative neurologic deficit without increasing the incidence of other complications.\r"

At onset, there were equal proportions of people with mild, moderate, and severe motor deficits, but the majority (76%) of those who survived 6 months had either no or only a mild deficit. Recovery of motor function was associated with the stroke severity but not with age or sex; patients with a mild motor deficit at onset were 10 times more likely to recover their motor function than those with a severe stroke. Our results confirm the reasonably optimistic outcome for survivors of stroke and further suggest that recovery of motor function is confined to patients whose motor deficit at onset is either mild or moderate.\r"

Despite the decline of national stroke mortality rates, rates in some areas failed to decline between 1962-1968 and 1969-1975. All areas experienced declines in 1976-1982, by which time some rates in the highest decile of the rate distribution were comparable to rates that had been in the lowest decile in 1962-1968. An east-west gradient of high-to-low stroke mortality rates was evident for both white men and white women in all three periods. Within the eastern part of the United States, high rates appeared more commonly in the South, and more so for white men than for white women. The \"stroke belt\" (area of very high stroke mortality rates in the coastal plain of the South) became less concentrated over the 2 decades, while a clustering of state economic areas with high rates along the Mississippi River and in the Ohio River valley became more pronounced.\r"

Our data indicate that preischemic hyperthermia results in an intracellular cerebral pH during recirculation significantly lower than that in normothermic cats. In hyperthermic cats beta-ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) concentrations and the ratio of PCr to inorganic phosphate failed to return to preischemic levels during recirculation in contrast to normothermic cats. Hyperthermia without ischemia and hyperthermia during recirculation had no significant effect on intracellular pH. Thus, preischemic hyperthermia has a detrimental effect on metabolic recovery after transient global cerebral ischemia.\r"

The earliest, but reversible, ischemic lesions occurred after 3 minutes' ischemia in the subiculum-CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus. The lesions became irreversible after 4 minutes' ischemia. The ischemic and postischemic lesions in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and caudoputamen were partially or completely reversible if the ischemic period was 5 minutes, whereas delayed degeneration occurred in the pyramidal cells of the medial CA1 region after reperfusion for 48 hours (delayed neuronal death). After 10 minutes' ischemia and subsequent reperfusion, delayed neuronal death extended from the medial to the lateral CA1 region; the ischemic and postischemic lesions in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and caudoputamen also expanded during reperfusion. Our investigation demonstrates that selective vulnerability existed in global cerebral ischemia as in incomplete or regional ischemia and suggests that neurons in many areas of the brain possessed the potential for recovery, progressive deterioration, and even delayed neuronal death depending on the severity and duration of cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the xanthine derivative propentofylline (HWA 285) to determine its protection against ischemic brain damage when administered before and after ischemia. Transient forebrain ischemia was produced in 81 Mongolian gerbils by occluding both carotid arteries. The necessary surgery was performed under anesthesia with intraperitoneal pentobarbital/chloral hydrate 2 days before occlusion. We tested the parameters delayed selective hippocampal nerve cell damage, generation of seizures, and survival. Determination of the dose-response relation revealed the optimal dose of HWA 285 to be 10 mg/kg i.p. The effect of the drug on delayed selective nerve cell damage in the hippocampus was assessed by measuring the intensity of Nissl staining in the CA1 area by means of densitometry 4 days after a 10-minute occlusion. Gerbils treated with HWA 285 revealed significant protection of the CA1 neurons even when the drug was applied 1 hour after the end of the occlusion. In contrast to HWA 285, pentobarbital provided no detectable protection of the CA1 neurons in our experimental model when administered 1 hour after occlusion, suggesting different mechanisms of action. After a 15-minute occlusion, all six untreated gerbils developed convulsions and died within 2 days. Chronic (daily) treatment of nine gerbils with HWA 285 prevented the generation of convulsions in eight and allowed seven to survive for greater than 12 days.\r"

Ringer's solution was continuously perfused at a rate of 10 microliters/min through 0.2-mm-diameter dialysis tubing implanted in the rat's caudate nucleus. After bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery, perfusate was collected at 20-minute intervals for 120 minutes and was analyzed for monoamines and their metabolites using high-performance liquid chromatography and an electrochemical detection system. The extracellular concentration of dopamine increased abruptly approximately 3 minutes after the ischemic insult, reached a maximum at between 20 and 40 minutes after the insult, and subsequently decreased. During the 120 minutes, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid concentrations decreased significantly, whereas 5-hydroxytryptamine was not detected. Our results indicate that during cerebral ischemia a large increase in extracellular dopamine concentration in the caudate nucleus occurs, probably as a result of energy failure of the cell membranes. This leakage of dopamine may be a causal factor in the neuronal damage associated with cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Using light and electron microscopy, we studied the interaction between lipids and host tissue for up to 15 days after experimentally produced cerebral infarcts in 16 rats. A lipid-dense zone was formed along the periphery of the infarcts before a glial response started; a glycogen-rich zone appeared peripheral to the lipid zone. Macrophages and astrocytes then started to proliferate in the lipid and glycogen-rich zones. The cerebral tissue within the lipid zone underwent complete necrosis. Ultrastructurally, lipids were observed in the edematous areas as well as in various types of hematogenous and resident cells. Glycogen granules were present mainly in the astrocytic processes. Macrophages rapidly evolved into foamy macrophages in the central necrotic areas, whereas foamy transformation was not striking in the peripheral, less injured areas. Reactive fibrous astrocytes also contained varying amounts of lipids. The exact biologic significance of the lipid zone in the premacrophagic stage remains unclear; however, since lipids are hydrophobic, they may function as a barrier against edema fluid extension into the adjacent tissue.\r"

Spectra were measured in the infarcts, in an area between the infarcts, and in the healthy hemisphere. The volumes of interest were selected on the basis of a fast T2-weighted image. A 1331-2662 Hahn spin-echo sequence was used to suppress the water in the 8-cm3 volume that was selected by means of spatially resolved spectroscopy or stimulated echoes. The spectra were obtained in 5 minutes' accumulation time. Spectral editing was applied to separate the resonance of lactate from that of other substances. Our results show no increase of lactate concentration within the infarcts after 6 months; however, a resonance was observed at 1.6 ppm, which is assigned to fatty acids. Peak intensities of brain-specific compounds were decreased. Six months after the onset of clinical symptoms (at the time of bypass surgery), a fivefold increase in lactate concentration compared with normal values was observed in the area between the two infarcts. Four months after bypass surgery, the lactate concentration in this area had decreased to only twice normal. We speculate that lactate is a marker of reversible or impending brain damage.\r"

Thirty-six patients underwent RT + C; 22 had C alone. The sole reason for choosing between RT + C versus C was physician prejudice favoring one form of therapy over another. Pretreatment clinical staging was similar in both groups, slightly favoring the RT + C group with only 25 percent versus 36 percent of C patients with clinical stage exceeding B1. Pathologic stage distribution similarly favored the RT + C group slightly with only 56 percent versus 68 percent of C patients having lesions with P-stage greater than B1. Thirty-three percent of patients in the RT + C group had papillary lesions in contrast to only 27 percent in the C alone group. There was only one postoperative death in each group. Three-year minimal follow-up was available in all surviving patients. One-, two-, and three-year survival free of disease was 94 percent, 80 percent, and 70 percent, respectively, in the group treated by C alone. Similar figures for the RT + C group were 86 percent, 76 percent, and 60 percent, respectively. Projected five-year survival rates for both groups regardless of preoperative RT was over 60 percent. All but one failure in the RT + C group had 4,000 rad or more preoperative radiation. This contemporary study shows no advantage of preoperative radiation in patients requiring cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.\r"

Patient positioning is problematic and usually the patient must be turned from supine to prone position or vice versa. Simultaneous access is possible by placing the patient in a prone position with the thighs and knees cradled laterally in a \"boot\" type stirrup. Thus access is afforded to a percutaneous nephrostomy tract and to the urethra for nephroscopic and ureteroscopic procedures, and at the same time adequate operator comfort is maintained. This approach has been used four times in 3 patients and has been a valuable factor in the endoscopic removal of massive renal and ureteral calculi.\r"

Intubation caused a median decrease in maximum flow rate of 1 mL/sec (95% confidence limits 0-2 mL/sec). In patients with infravesical obstruction a significant decrease in maximum and mean flow rates was found whereas the flow rate was unchanged in the group of patients without obstruction. It seems that changes in flow rate due to intubation of the urethra is of minor importance compared with other factors and intubation may actually provide diagnostic information in diagnosing mechanical obstruction. It is concluded that the transurethral technique for pressure-flow studies offers a simple and reliable method for obtaining simultaneous pressure-flow values. It can be performed without further invasion in conjunction with cystometry. Therefore this technique is recommended in the urodynamic testing of male patients with lower urinary tract disorders.\r"

Of the remaining patients with no or only non-complex ectopic beats, five (15%) died. The difference was significant using Gehan's test of censored data (p less than 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant increase of death risk associated with complex ventricular ectopic beats as well as with heart failure (relative risk 3.6 and 5.9, respectively). Age, gender, number of ventricular ectopic beats, cardiac enlargement on X-ray and angina pectoris had no significant effect on mortality. The prevalence of ventricular ectopy was 84% (n = 43) irrespective of age and sex and equal to the finding in the late hospital phase reported by other investigators, and in healthy subjects. Complex ventricular ectopic beats appeared in 35% (n = 17). The prevalence increased significantly with age and was significantly higher in post-infarction patients (38%) than in healthy individuals (8%). The present results indicate that a subgroup containing most of the high-risk patients may be identified early after AMI by detecting complex premature ventricular beats in continuous electrocardiographic recordings.\r"

Subjects with type II DM had lower concentrations of magnesium (3.79 +/- 0.32 vs. 4.29 +/- 0.22 mmol/100 g FFDS), potassium (40.5 +/- 5.17 vs. 46.1 +/- 3.81 mmol/100 g FFDS) and zinc (231 +/- 29 vs. 247 +/- 23 ng/mg FFDS) in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the urinary excretions of magnesium and zinc were higher, as compared with those in healthy controls (5.00 +/- 2.68 vs. 3.62 +/- 1.47 mmol/24 hours, and 683 +/- 285 vs. 326 +/- 205 micrograms/24 hours, respectively). The contents of magnesium, potassium and zinc plasma did not correlate with the corresponding concentrations in skeletal muscle or circulating blood cells, as investigated in healthy controls, diabetics and in all subjects together, implying that the plasma concentrations are not useful in the assessment of electrolyte status. Hence, deficiency of electrolytes frequently occurs, and should be looked for, in subjects with type II DM.\r"

About 90% of the patients with non-malignant hematological disorders responded to vaccination with a rise in antibody titres, which was significantly higher than in the other two groups studied. Malignant hematological disorders lowered the response rate to 61-67%. Patients with no known hematological disorder but with intra-abdominal carcinomas also responded less frequently, while those in this group with other surgical reasons for splenectomy had a response rate comparable to healthy individuals. No serious side-effects were reported and we therefore conclude that all splenectomized patients should be vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine. However, it must always be born in mind that one third of the patients with malignant disease did not respond to vaccination.\r"

Intestinal biopsy was performed in six of the 38 patients; one had total and one partial villous atrophy. Serum zinc was significantly lower in DS patients (median 14.7 mumol/l, range 5.5-20 mumol/l) than in the controls (median 16.4 mumol/l, range 12.7-19.5 mumol/l). DS patients with increased IgA activity to gluten weighed less and had lower concentrations of zinc in serum than DS patients with normal IgA activity. Twenty-eight per cent of the DS patients had autoantibodies to the thyroid gland. Our results suggest intestinal malfunction in DS, perhaps related to a defect of immune regulation caused by reduced levels of zinc in serum.\r"

  ".W": "The ongoing Prospective Cardiovascular Munster (PROCAM) study was initiated in 1979. The objectives of this trial were to determine the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in the German population, improve the prediction and early detection of CHD, and derive recommendations for the primary prevention of vascular disease from the trial results. Of male PROCAM trial participants, ages 40 to 65 years, who had been free of myocardial infarction or stroke at the time of entry and had been followed up for 4 years, longitudinal data analysis shows that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia are independent risk factors for CHD. The concomitant occurrence of these factors leads to a cumulative increase in CHD risk. Hyperlipidemia is a more significant risk factor for CHD than hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Ongoing data from 4043 men and 1333 women, ages 50 to 65 years, show that more than 50% of all diabetics are hypertensive. Cholesterol is slightly increased in male hypertensives and diabetics of either sex, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is slightly raised in male hypertensives and female diabetics only. The serum triglyceride concentrations are higher for hypertensives and markedly higher for diabetics of both sexes. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations are decreased in hypertensives, especially in hypertensive women, and even more so in diabetics. The European Consensus Conference for primary prevention of CHD has classified hyperlipidemia into five groups (A to E). For hypertensives, the proportion of patients in group D (cholesterol between 200 and 300 mg/dl and triglyceride levels between 200 and 500 mg/dl) is 20.4% for men and 6.2% for women, about twice as high as those in the control groups. The occurrence of combined (group D) or massive hyperlipidemia (group E: cholesterol greater than 300 mg/dl and/or triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dl) is prevalent in more than 30% of all diabetics: two to three times more frequently than in nondiabetic patients. When concomitant hypertension is included, this prevalence increases to more than 40% for diabetic men. Among those patients endangered by three risk factors, approximately 40% of all men and 60% of all women have the particularly atherogenic combination that includes lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\r"

  ".W": "Any alteration in the balance between serum lipids, platelets, hemodynamic factors, and the blood vessel wall may lead to the development of atherosclerosis. Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are two major risk factors that accelerate the development of coronary heart disease. The mechanisms of the interactions of these two risk factors are examined in this paper. First, hypertension may be associated with focal or generalized endothelial injury or dysfunction. The altered endothelial functional integrity may predispose to platelet aggregation and altered vessel wall interaction, which may stimulate proliferation and growth of vascular cells. Second, elevated serum cholesterol levels may accelerate lipid deposition and formation of atherosclerotic plaques. In hypertension the rate of clearance of lipoprotein from the vessel wall may be reduced. Third, the sympathetic nervous system may be involved in both the development of hypertension and the alterations of lipid metabolism. Adrenergic activation, which increases blood pressure may also adversely affect lipid metabolism. This is in part alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated. Selective alpha 1-inhibitors have been found to prevent or reduce atherosclerosis in experimental animals. Selective alpha 1-inhibitors may act at a number of sites on lipoprotein metabolic pathways to favorably influence serum lipids. Taken together, the relationship between hypertension and atherosclerosis involves complex mechanisms. A complete understanding of the mechanisms is of obvious importance.\r"

Seven hundred seventy-one patients were entered into the study, which involved three phases: (1) a 2-week baseline period, (2) an 8-week period in which patients received doxazosin, 1 to 8 mg once daily, and (3) a 4-week maintenance period. From baseline to final visit there was a highly significant 27% reduction (p less than 0.001) in calculated CHD risk based on the Framingham equation as a consequence of doxazosin's favorable effects on both blood pressure and serum lipid levels. Efficacy and toleration of doxazosin therapy were good to excellent in most patients. The investigators' global assessment of efficacy of once-daily doxazosin therapy was excellent or good for 82% of patients and fair or poor for only 18% of patients. After 12 weeks, 83% of the patients were considered therapy successes (sitting diastolic blood pressure either less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg reduction not reaching less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) at a mean daily dose of 3.5 mg. Seventy-one percent achieved \"normalized\" blood pressure control (sitting diastolic less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with a decrease of greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg) at a mean dose of 3.1 mg once daily.

  ".W": "Although the pathology of essential hypertension is still unclear, studies have shown that doxazosin, a selective alpha 1-inhibitor, is able to effectively control mild-to-moderate hypertension. The aim of these two, noncomparative studies was to evaluate the efficacy and toleration of doxazosin when used as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. In study I, 154 patients with standing and sitting diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) ranging from 95 to 115 mm Hg were treated with once-daily doxazosin (1 to 8 mg) as monotherapy for 12 weeks. Both sitting and standing blood pressures were significantly reduced by doxazosin monotherapy. Target DBP of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg was achieved in 86% of patients after 12 weeks of therapy with doxazosin, and there was no change in heart rate. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly decreased by doxazosin, but there was no change in glucose levels. Minor side effects were seen in 17.5% of patients, and 2.6% discontinued therapy. In study II, 65 patients with DBPs ranging from 95 to 115 mm Hg on existing antihypertensive therapies were concomitantly treated with doxazosin (1 to 8 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. Target DBPs of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg was achieved in 71% of patients after 12 weeks of therapy with doxazosin. There was no change in heart rate throughout the treatment period, and plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels remained essentially unchanged. Three patients, each receiving a beta-blocker, a diuretic, and doxazosin, were withdrawn because of side effects. Minor side effects, which were considered drug related were seen in 21% of patients. Doxazosin is a drug with good antihypertensive efficacy and is well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and various combinations of these drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although surgical removal is the therapy of choice in patients with pheochromocytoma, medical management is necessary in the preoperative preparation of these patients and in inoperable cases. An alpha-adrenoceptor-blocking agent is routinely used as initial therapy to control hypertension, with a beta-blocker used as a second-step agent to control tachycardia when indicated. Doxazosin, a selective alpha 1-inhibitor used as an antihypertensive agent for the reduction of coronary heart disease risk in hypertensive patients, appears to be a good agent to control blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate. The aim of this study was to assess the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin when used alone or in conjunction with a beta-blocker in 24 patients with pheochromocytoma. Overall excellent or good antihypertensive efficacy was assessed by physicians in 19 of 24 patients (79.2%) enrolled in the study. Doxazosin monotherapy was effective in eight of 12 patients (66.7%), and combined therapy with a beta-blocker was effective in 11 of 12 patients (91.7%). The mean pulse rate remained constant throughout therapy. Adverse reactions were minor and transient and occurred in only three patients. Urinary and plasma catecholamine levels tended to decrease or remained unchanged during doxazosin therapy. There were no clinically hazardous abnormalities or problems in hematologic and biochemical laboratory data. Overall, doxazosin was considered very useful or useful in 83.3% of patients. In conclusion, doxazosin appears to be an excellent agent for the management of hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma.\r"

  ".U": "89074540\r", 
  ".W": "The efficacy and toleration of doxazosin and atenolol were compared over a 52-week period in a double-blind, multicenter study of 228 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Over the treatment period, both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure, and there were no clinically or statistically significant differences between treatment groups for reductions in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures or in sitting diastolic blood pressure. However, atenolol treatment caused significantly greater reductions in sitting systolic blood pressure and heart rate. Neither drug significantly affected total serum cholesterol concentrations. Doxazosin treatment lowered serum triglycerides, whereas atenolol treatment produced an increase in serum triglycerides (p less than 0.001, week 30; p less than 0.01, week 50, between treatment groups). Increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol ratio were obtained with doxazosin treatment, whereas atenolol treatment decreased these lipid fractions (p less than 0.0001, weeks 30 and 50, between treatment groups). Using the Framingham equation, it was calculated that at week 50 the risk of developing coronary heart disease was reduced by 22% for the group taking doxazosin (p less than 0.001 vs baseline) and by 4% (not significant) for patients taking atenolol (p = 0.01, between treatment groups). It is concluded that doxazosin is a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive drug with a favorable effect on blood lipids. Doxazosin provides an attractive, new alternative first-line drug for the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.\r"

Atenolol, although a widely used beta-blocker, appears to adversely affect blood lipids by increasing triglycerides and decreasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The aim of our study was to compare doxazosin and atenolol for their therapeutic efficacy in reducing CHD risk (decrease in blood pressure and effect on lipid distribution) and toleration. Patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized into two groups of 20 patients to receive once-daily atenolol (100 mg) or doxazosin (2 to 8 mg) for 8 weeks. Doxazosin was as effective as atenolol in reducing supine and standing blood pressure. Unlike atenolol, doxazosin did not produce a marked bradycardia. Doxazosin therapy produced favorable modifications in plasma lipid profiles by decreasing triglycerides and total cholesterol and by increasing HDL cholesterol and HDL/total cholesterol ratio. A reverse in this lipid profile was seen with atenolol. Therefore doxazosin may reduce calculated CHD risk more effectively than atenolol, based on the Framingham equation.\r"

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and toleration of doxazosin with atenolol, one of the most frequently used cardioselective beta-blockers in Italy. Forty patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were treated with either atenolol (100 mg) or doxazosin (mean dose, 3.3 mg) once daily for 8 weeks. Both drugs significantly reduced supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Atenolol induced marked bradycardia, whereas doxazosin had very little effect on heart rate. Doxazosin produced a favorable effect on blood lipid levels by decreasing triglyceride and total cholesterol levels and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein total cholesterol ratio. Atenolol had exactly the opposite effect on blood lipid levels. Both drugs had equivalent toleration profiles. It was concluded that doxazosin was as effective as atenolol in reducing elevated supine and standing blood pressures. In addition, doxazosin had a beneficial effect on lipid profiles and minimal effect on heart rate. Therefore doxazosin may reduce calculated coronary heart disease risk in hypertensive patients.\r"

It is suitable for measurements of daily energy expenditure in humans with an accuracy of +/- 1.5% and can be reproduced without difficulty in both developed and developing countries.\r"

Milk transfer to the infant was low on days 1 and 2 and increased rapidly to 498 +/- 129 g/d (means +/- SD) on day 5 and then more slowly to 753 +/- 89 g/d during months 3-5. There was a characteristic milk volume for each mother-infant pair that was significantly related neither to milk yield on days 4-6 nor to birth weight. It was, however, strongly related to infant weight at 1 mo, suggesting that infant and/or maternal factors coming into play during the first month of life are strong determinants of subsequent milk transfer to the infant.\r"

Daily intakes of greater than 20 g (average of either 25 or 41 g) were attended by serious disability and deaths of 79% and 81%, respectively. Oil intakes bore an indirect relationship to fat consumption. Treatment early and before severe disability developed improved prognosis, and females tended to do better than males. High sensitivity to fats suggests they are involved in the genesis of multiple sclerosis.\r"

From simulation analyses we suggest that 1.1 +/- 0.1 - 0.2 g.kg-1.d-1 is a more reasonable estimate. This is consistent with statements that 1) breast milk that provides an average of 16 g protein/1000 kcal or a fixed-composition formula that contains 17 g protein/1000 kcal is adequate for essentially all such infants and 2) average protein intakes from that milk or formula would be approximately 1.65 or 1.75 g.kg-1.d-1, close to current average requirements estimates. It appears that there has been a difference in the concepts of requirement usually applied to infants and to adults and a systematic misinterpretation of breast-milk data in estimating requirements. A plea is issued for the application of epidemiologic approaches as a part of requirement estimation.\r"

Fifty-eight percent of 103 subjects produced greater than 20 microL H2/L after consuming 50 g pure fructose in water. About half of those who absorbed fructose incompletely (incomplete absorbers) had abdominal symptoms. Malabsorption of medium doses of pure fructose may therefore be common in man. When 25 g pure fructose was consumed, only 19% of 21 poor absorbers (of 50 g fructose) still produced excess breath H2. When glucose was taken with fructose, the frequency and amount of excessive breath H2 was substantially reduced. This facilitating phenomenon is not generally known but is important because in natural foods fructose occurs in association or in combination (as sucrose) with glucose. Plasma fructose responses were not lower in poor absorbers presumably because these responses depend more on how much fructose passes through the liver than on how much is absorbed.\r"

Six subjects (1 placebo, 5 vitamin A) who developed liver abnormalities during treatment underwent liver biopsies; five had fibrosis or cirrhosis. A significant decrease in luteinizing hormone was noted in the group given vitamin A compared with the placebo-treated group.

Serum samples from the Cu-depletion study of Reiser et al were analyzed for phospholipid fatty acid composition. After the participants had been on the low copper diet for 11 wk, serum phospholipids contained 27% less oleic acid, 38% more arachidonic acid, and 94% more docosahexaenoic acid (all p less than 0.01) than samples taken from the same subjects before Cu depletion. These fatty acid changes were of a similar direction and magnitude to those in moderately Cu-depleted rats and may be useful as an index of moderate Cu depletion in humans.\r"

Lactation history was not associated with significant differences in bone density in any bone site. With respect to height, weight, Ca intake, and duration of lactation, only height was correlated to bone density and only for L2-L3 (r = 0.48, p less than 0.02).

Subsets of DR4 were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. Dw4 was increased in rheumatoid arthritis patients, and the frequency of the other subsets appeared to be similar in rheumatoid arthritis patients and control subjects. A polymorphism associated with the T cell receptor V-beta-8 gene family was significantly increased in rheumatoid arthritis patients.\r"

The 4.8-, 5.2-, and 7.0-kb RFLPs correlated with DR4, -7, -9, and -w53 phenotypes and the 6.0-kb RFLP correlated only with DR4. Thus, these RFLPs do not appear to be disease-specific. A DQ-beta 3.2-kb RFLP was found in 63.5 percent of rheumatoid arthritis patients and in 38.0 percent of control subjects (p = 0.01, RR = 2.8). This fragment was frequently found in persons expressing DR1 and DQw1 phenotypes. Probes consisting of the first exon of the DR-beta-I and DR-beta-IV genes, respectively, only hybridized with the 5.2- and 6.0-kb RFLPs. These data suggest that more than one gene within the major histocompatibility complex contributes to susceptibility to seropositive rheumatoid arthritis in white persons.\r"

Analysis of the major histocompatibility complex gene products and genes with major histocompatibility complex class II and class III locus-specific probes and oligonucleotide probes for selected human leukocyte antigen DQ-beta alleles showed significant increases of human leukocyte antigen DR2 and the rare DQ-beta allele DR2-DQw1.AZH in the lupus nephritis patients compared with lupus patients without renal disease (relative risk = 8.3). C4A null was detected in one third of all of the SLE patients. In two thirds of the C4A null patients this was due to a DR3-associated C4A gene deletion. The remaining third may have a regulatory defect and this was DR2-associated. DR4 was significantly decreased in the nephritis patients in comparison with the non-renal SLE patients (relative risk = 0.3). A novel DQ-beta gene has been sequenced from two SLE patients that has not been observed in the normal population. Potential implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The recognition of the association between complete and partial complement (C) deficiencies and immune complex-mediated diseases is of clinical and etiopathologic interest. From studies of sera deficient in C1, C4, C2, or C3, the crucial role of these complement components in promoting the solubility and clearance of immune complexes has been elucidated. Moreover, partial C4 deficiency appears to be a common risk factor for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, with complete C4A deficiency (C4A null) being present in 10 to 15 percent and heterozygous C4A deficiency present in 50 to 80 percent of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Most importantly, there is an obvious pathophysiologic relationship between the function of complement relative to immune complex processing and the disease that results from their deficiency. Systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by excessive quantities of inappropriately deposited immune complexes. More subtle complement component and receptor deficiencies are likely to be predisposing factors for autoimmune disease. The complement deficiencies provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate the origin and development of immune complex excess syndromes.\r"

The non-SCLC cell lines studied have also been demonstrated to express elevated mRNA levels for platelet-derived growth factors and transforming growth factors, while SCLC cell lines were negative for these genes. Four human SCLC cell lines and six human non-SCLC cell lines were inoculated into seventeen nude mice. All studied tumors from the non-SCLC cell lines demonstrated prominent fibrous stromata, although with variability between the individual cell lines. The SCLC cell lines were deprived of significant stroma reaction. These findings may be of importance in explaining the biologic and clinical differences between non-SCLC and SCLC.\r"

The vessels were whole mounted and the luminal surface examined en face using both transmitted light and epifluorescence microscopy. With this technique it is possible to identify and quantitate mononuclear cells adhering to the vessel wall, determine the distribution and number of intimal foam cells within the intima, and determine the mitotic index of the endothelium. Tissue samples can be quickly prepared using this technique, thus allowing rapid analysis of the influence of various substances on the early stages of atherosclerotic lesion formation in animals fed an atherogenic diet.\r"

The goals of this study were to examine composition of normal cerebral arterioles, and to determine whether chronic hypertension alters relative composition of the arteriolar wall. Pial arterioles in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats contain large amounts of smooth muscle, small amounts of elastin and basement membrane, and very little collagen. Hypertrophy of pial arterioles in SHRSP is characterized by increases in the elastic components, smooth muscle and elastin. The stiffer components, collagen and basement membrane either did not change or decreased. It is concluded that cerebral arterioles contain proportionately more smooth muscle and less collagen than large arteries, and that hypertrophy of cerebral arterioles in SHRSP is accompanied by a relative increase in the more elastic components of the arteriolar wall, which probably contributes to the increase in arteriolar distensibility.\r"

The lung hydroxyproline in control, Poly I:C, Bleo, and Bleo + Poly I:C groups averaged 791, 752, 1177, and 766 micrograms/lung. As compared to control, the prolyl hydroxylase activity in the Bleo group was increased by 83% whereas in Bleo + Poly I:C group, the activity was increased by 42%. Protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage supernatant in Poly I:C, Bleo and Bleo + Poly I:C groups were 72, 286, and 206% of the control, respectively. There was no difference in total leukocyte counts between Bleo + Poly I:C and Bleo groups, but the differential cell counts were changed. The numbers of neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils were 50, 84, 91, and 10% of Bleo group, respectively. Morphometric estimates of the volume of parenchymal lesion within the lung showed that hamsters in Bleo + Poly I:C group had significantly less volume of lesion (1.0 cucm) than the Bleo group (1.6 cucm). In addition, the fibrotic lesions in Bleo + Poly I:C group were multifocal and primarily proximal acinar in location, had fewer extracellular fibers, neutrophils and monocytes. Poly I:C treatment ameliorated bleomycin-induced lung collagen accumulation.\r"

Resident macrophages did not express TNF even after stimulus with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In contrast, 12% of macrophages elicited with Freund's adjuvant stained positively and up to 60% were positive after LPS stimulation. Analysis of the kinetics of expression revealed that maximal staining occurred from 1-3 hours after stimulus with disappearance of staining by 12 hours. Both a membrane and cytoplasmic pattern of staining could be demonstrated. The presence of plasma membrane TNF was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Northern blot analysis and bioassay revealed that the kinetics of TNF mRNA synthesis corresponded to the appearance of the protein while its disappearance corresponded to the appearance of TNF in the supernate. Thus, TNF synthesis and secretion could be histochemically demonstrated. These findings support the notion that TNF production is a characteristic of activated macrophages and that such cells display membrane-associated TNF at least transiently after stimulation.\r"

When PRL receptor was chromatographed on affinity columns containing PrR-7A antibody or monoclonal antibody against hemocyanin, which served as a control, PRL receptor was bound to the column containing PrR-7A antibody, but not to the column containing control antibody. When solubilized PRL receptor was incubated with PrR-7A antibody, the specific binding of the receptor was reduced 52%. Female mice were treated with the carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, and during the succeeding 48 weeks were treated weekly with PrR-7A antibody or control antibody. In the control group 13% developed mammary carcinomas, and 16% developed moderate-to-severe intraductal hyperplasia. No mammary carcinomas were found in the mice treated with PrR-7A antibody, and only 8% of the mice had moderate-to-severe intraductal hyperplasia. Male mice made hyperprolactinemic by implanted pituitary glands were treated weekly with PrR-7A or control antibody. After 7 weeks of treatment, the mean weight of the prostates of mice treated with PrR-7A antibody was 8 +/- 1.1 mg (mean +/- SE), and that of mice treated with control antibody was 27 +/- 3.6 mg. Similar differences were seen in the protein and DNA content of the prostates. These results indicate that PrR-7A antibody is directed against PRL receptor and that immunization with this antibody reduces the incidence of PRL-dependent mammary tumors and preneoplastic ductal hyperplasia and prevents PRL-induced hyperplasia of the prostate.\r"

This process may involve both cytoplasmic extension by MC and actual cellular migration. For investigation of whether extracellular matrix factors could modulate this process, the migratory responses of rat MC were quantitatively examined using a cell culture model. Denuding (\"wounding\") a portion of a confluent culture of MC was followed by migration of mesangial cells into the denuded area. The expected proliferative response to this treatment was blocked by irradiation. The migratory response began within 8 hours of wounding and continued for at least 80 hours. The MC migratory response was specifically inhibited in a dose-dependent and reversible manner by heparin and heparinlike glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulfates and hyaluronic acid did not significantly inhibit MC migration. Glomerular basement membrane heparinlike GAGs may normally prevent MC extension into the pericapillary space. Changes in the density or composition of these substances during glomerular inflammatory processes could permit the development of MC pericapillary extensions and thereby lead to further alterations in basement membrane integrity.\r"

The nuclear DNA content was determined in terms of the mean nuclear DNA content, DNA histogram pattern, and the occurrence of the aneuploid stem cell line. The mean nuclear DNA content of the thymic carcinoma was significantly higher than that of both subgroups of thymoma (P less than 0.01), but there was no significant difference between noninvasive and invasive thymomas. The aneuploid stem cell line appeared in 92.3% of thymic carcinomas, one case (7.7%) of invasive thymomas, and none of noninvasive thymomas. Abnormal DNA histogram patterns were seen in 53.8% of thymic carcinomas and none of the thymomas. The mean nuclear area increased significantly in the increasing order of noninvasive thymoma, invasive thymoma, and thymic carcinoma (P less than 0.01). The cytofluorometric and morphometric results demonstrated a significant difference in degree of malignancy between thymic carcinoma and thymoma; however, there was a trend toward an increasing degree of malignancy from noninvasive to invasive thymomas, yet there was a sizeable overlap in results between the two groups. Therefore, these two methods are not satisfactory for predicting the behavior of an individual case of noninvasive or invasive thymoma.\r"

Twenty-seven seronegative cottontail rabbits were infected with Herpesvirus sylvilagus and all developed antibodies within 10 days. Neutralizing antibody was detected as early as 7 days after infection. Virus was isolated from blood mononuclear cells, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, kidneys, lung, and liver as early as 3 days after infection. Infected animals showed leucocytosis, monocytosis, and lymphocytosis with the appearance of atypical lymphocytes. Peripheral blood abnormalities peaked at 10-14 days after infection, and returned to normal by 28 days after infection, with the exception of atypical lymphocytosis that persisted in some animals for more than 2 years after experimental infection. More severe histopathologic changes were seen in virus-infected juvenile rabbits than adult rabbits; these changes included viral myocarditis, interstitial pneumonia, and lymphocytic myositis. Reactive hyperplasia and subsequent lymphocytic depletion of spleen and lymph nodes were reminiscent of that seen in virus-associated hemophagocytosis syndrome. Prominent lymphoid hyperplasia of many nonlymphoid organs, most notably the kidney and lungs, was observed. The development of these lymphoproliferative lesions and other lymphoid changes during H. sylvilagus infection suggest that this system may be a model to study similar lesions induced by EBV infection in humans.\r"

Twenty patients with breast carcinoma had biopsy specimens taken prior to and upon completion of modified radical mastectomy. Ten had axillary dissection followed by mastectomy (Group A). The others had mobilization of the breast before axillary dissection (Group B). The estrogen receptor concentration was higher in 14 of 20 premastectomy specimens. All 10 patients in Group B had positive receptors before mastectomy; 5 were negative after mastectomy. All seven patients in Group A with positive premastectomy receptors remained so postmastectomy. We concluded that if a tumor specimen for receptor analysis is not obtained prior to modified radical mastectomy, axillary dissection should precede breast mobilization.\r"

Variation between interpretations was significant, with complete agreement among the radiologists in 16 percent of cases. We concluded that needle-directed biopsy for occult breast lesions is very effective in bringing patients with a more favorable prognosis to early surgery. The false-positive rate will be high and the interpretation of a given mammogram will vary, depending on the radiologist. Mammography for subtle lesions is sensitive but nonspecific; therefore, it is wise to biopsy all lesions that are even slightly suspicious, particularly in patients with a previous history of breast cancer or other risk factors.\r"

The number of malignancies and polyps identified was disappointingly low. Our findings would challenge the concept of unsupervised mass screening from the viewpoint of cost-effectiveness; however, because of the numerous voluntary services and supplies, this particular project was useful in educating the public about early colon cancer detection.\r"

Common presenting signs and symptoms were vague abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, change in bowel habits, and guaiac-positive stools.

Their median survival was 4 months compared with 24 months in the four patients diagnosed early. As with adults, the mainstay of therapy is operation. Our data indicate that an increased awareness and consideration of colon cancer in children will result in earlier diagnosis, a more favorable disease stage, and prolonged survival.\r"

The incidence of ruptured AAA, multiple aneurysms, and a family history of AAA was higher in Group II patients. We concluded that patients with AAA and without atherosclerotic occlusive disease in other areas represent a subgroup with peculiar clinical characteristics. In planning operative treatment and during the follow-up period, it should be kept in mind that Group II patients have a higher incidence of aneurysm rupture; the incidence of late pseudoaneurysm is higher; and there is a greater possibility of aneurysm in other arterial segments. It remains to be seen if the pathogenetic mechanism of AAA formation in Group II patients is different from that in Group I patients.\r"

The mortality rate was not significantly different among patients with symptomatic, intact aneurysms undergoing emergency operation (3 percent) and those without symptoms having elective operation (5 percent). The mortality rate of patients with ruptured aneurysms was 68 percent. We concluded that the addition of preoperative computerized tomography to the clinical evaluation would not have improved these results. Furthermore, since it is expensive and delays emergency operation in patients with ruptured aneurysms, computerized tomography seems rarely indicated in symptomatic patients with obvious aneurysms.\r"

In the elective group, the most common complication involved the cardiovascular system, whereas sepsis with multiple organ failure accounted for all of the deaths in the emergency group. Among the 212 patients studied, there was a 3 percent mortality rate in the elective group and a 10 percent mortality rate in the emergency group, with an overall mortality rate of 6 percent. The results indicated that since the risks of elective cholecystectomy are relatively low in the elderly and the risks of cholecystectomy performed as an emergency are considerably higher (10 percent), symptomatic elderly patients with gallstones should be considered good candidates for early elective cholecystectomy.\r"

We identified 33 infections in this group of 32 patients. The majority of the etiologic agents were not identified using traditional microbiologic techniques, often leading to a delay in diagnosis. In this high-risk group of patients, we recommend histologic study of tissue with special stains such as methenamine silver. When the patient's condition warrants, frozen sections can be used. Optimal outcome requires early recognition of the specific etiologic agent.\r"

After a median observation period of 11 days, 91 patients underwent thoracotomy and decortication and 9 patients underwent either rib resection, an Eloesser flap procedure, or both. The mortality rate was 6 percent 30 days postoperatively, the in-hospital mortality rate was 9 percent, and the overall morbidity rate was 17 percent. An excellent result was achieved in 85 percent of the patients with a recurrence rate of 4 percent.

Age stratification aided significantly in predicting mortality in elderly patients. Regression analysis was employed to examine the data set to determine the relative importance of several variables in the prediction of ultimate mortality. By incorporating all the data from the entire data set, curves describing the contribution of age and shock to mortality corrected for all factors is possible. Increasing age after 65 increases mortality and this effect is dramatically increased by the presence of shock.

There were 185 patients with penetrating injuries and 63 with blunt injuries. Associated injuries were present in 119 patients. Acute perioperative morbidity occurred in 53 percent of the patients with associated injuries and 22 percent of patients with no associated injuries. On long-term follow-up, five patients developed small bowel obstructions. The incidence of small bowel obstruction was related to operative exposure. We have concluded that early morbidity after a negative laparotomy is more common when associated injuries are present. The risk of postoperative small bowel obstruction is small, especially when extensive operative dissection is not necessary. Abdominal exploration should not be discarded as a viable diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in patients with equivocal findings.\r"

  ".W": "Atracurium was administered by a variety of techniques to determine whether these influence the onset or duration of muscular relaxation, and the frequency of cutaneous reactions, after a standard induction dose of thiopentone. One-hundred-and-fifty patients were allocated randomly to receive the drug by one of five methods: into a fast-flowing crystalloid infusion in the antecubital fossa; into a winged needle in the antecubital fossa with flushing after the thiopentone; into a winged needle in the antecubital fossa without flushing; into a winged needle in the dorsum of the hand without flushing. The above groups received atracurium freshly removed from the refrigerator whereas the fifth group were given atracurium which had been maintained at room temperature for at least 2 weeks. The frequency of cutaneous reactions was between 60 and 70% overall and there were no significant differences either in this or in the onset or duration of action between the groups. A further 25 patients with a history of drug allergy were also investigated by the first method and showed no significant differences in response, but 25 patients aged over 70 years had a significantly lower frequency of cutaneous reactions with a higher frequency of hypotension than the other groups.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative recovery rooms have been used in the United Kingdom for just over 30 years. Anaesthetic and surgical practices have improved during this time but the clinical problems encountered are unchanged essentially. Several surveys have reviewed complications that occur; the most common causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality are still cardiovascular and respiratory problems, the latter particularly of the upper airway. In contrast there are no data available on the standard of staff and equipment in recovery rooms. The results of a survey of this aspect of postoperative recovery rooms in hospitals in Wessex, North West Thames and Yorkshire Regional Health Authorities are reported. Particular effort was made to define the facilities available. The results indicate that 70% of hospitals do not provide staffing levels and facilities which meet recommendations of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland. The implications of these findings with regard to anaesthetic morbidity and mortality are discussed.\r"

The aim was to compare the midline and paramedian approaches of locating the space, the estimated risk of accidental dural puncture, the course taken by the epidural catheter after introduction and with special attention to the influence of the dorsomedian connective tissue band. The paramedian needle passed a greater distance within the epidural space before contact with the dura mater and demonstrated a low risk of accidental dural puncture. The catheter passed by the paramedian approach did not cause any tenting of the dura and took a straight cephalad direction in all 14 cases. The midline catheter caused tenting of the dura in all 14 cases and the direction of travel was variable. Differences were statistically significant. Influence of the dorsomedian connective tissue band was greatest on the behaviour of the midline needle and catheter.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine whether alterations in the median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials occur during the stimuli of tracheal intubation and skin incision. Twenty-two patients scheduled for elective surgery and who required tracheal intubation were studied. Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded, analysed and stored approximately every 40 seconds. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and vecuronium used for neuromuscular blockade; the trachea was intubated 2 minutes after induction. Fentanyl 1.5 micrograms/kg was administered subsequently. Evoked potential monitoring was continued until at least 2 minutes after surgical incision. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with an increase in evoked potential latency of 0.8 msec and reduction in amplitude of 1.7 microV. Small, statistically insignificant changes occurred between induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation. Surgical incision was accompanied by a statistically significant mean decrease in evoked potential latency of 0.5 msec and a statistically significant increase in evoked potential amplitude of 0.6 microV. The fact that surgical stimulation produced an activating effect on evoked potentials suggests that they may be used as a measure of the neurophysiological effects of anaesthesia.\r"

Similar pressures were then applied in vitro to 10 catheters of each gauge, and the flow of fluid observed from the three holes. For each size of catheter, with increasing pressure, flow appeared at the proximal, then the middle, and finally the distal hole. This emphasises that the effect of epidural doses can vary depending on the pressure of injection, especially if the catheter had been passed partially through the dura.\r"

Factors frequently associated with these mishaps were failure to perform a normal check and lack of familiarity with equipment or technique. An anaesthesia equipment checklist was incorporated in the survey during the second period and 43 mishaps were reported. This decrease in incidence may have resulted from the anaesthesia apparatus checklist, awareness of mishaps since they were discussed regularly at departmental meetings, and new anaesthesia machines (eight older machines were replaced during the first period and 11 at the beginning of the second).\r"

The predicted costs for each year until 2000 AD were derived. To these were added sums required to make good existing shortfalls and to introduce a moderate amount of equipment incorporating newer technology. The totals showed that the capital currently available in the health district is sufficient only for anaesthetic equipment and requires a substantial increase to replace medical apparatus belonging to all specialties already in routine clinical use. Health authorities must be given detailed projections of these costs.\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiology of mycobacterial disease in Japan changed considerably over the period 1971 to 1984. During this time, the incidence of pulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis has steadily declined; disease caused by M. avium complex has remained stable; disease caused by M. kansasii has increased considerably; and, for the first time, substantial numbers of cases caused by M. szulgai, M. fortuitum, M. chelonae, and M. nonchromogenicum have been reported. From 1981 to 1984 the incidence of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterioses (NTM) was estimated at 1.73 +/- 0.25 cases per 100,000 population per year; of these, M. avium complex constituted 1.29 +/- 0.24 and M. kansasii 0.34 +/- 0.11 per 100,000 per year. The prevalence of the NTM was relatively high in southwestern Japan (industrialized, warm climate) and low in northern Japan (rural, cold).\r"

  ".W": "We made simultaneous measurements of pulmonary hemodynamics, cardiac output, and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) to assess the right ventricular function in 14 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension as a result of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). From these measurements, the right ventricular end-systolic pressure/volume relationship could be calculated and used to assess right ventricular contractility. Eight of the patients were clinically stable, without edema, and 6 presented acutely with gross edema, indicating decompensated cor pulmonale. Measurements were made at rest, while breathing air and oxygen. Although mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) was similar in those with (Ppa = 33 +/- 6 mm Hg) and without edema (Ppa = 30 +/- 8 mm Hg, p greater than 0.05), RVEF was lower in edematous (RVEF = 0.23 +/- 0.11) compared with non-edematous patients (RVEF = 0.47 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.01). Cardiac output was normal in both groups. The mean right ventricular end-systolic pressure/volume ratio (P/V) was lower in those patients with edema (P/V = 0.41 +/- 0.27), as compared with those without edema (P/V = 1.69 +/- 0.35, p less than 0.05), as a result of an increase in right ventricular end-systolic volume index. Similarly, left ventricular end-systolic volumes were higher in edematous than in non-edematous patients. Breathing 1 to 3 L/min of oxygen for 30 min decreased total pulmonary vascular resistance (p less than 0.05) in those patients without edema, but not in patients with edema. Oxygen did not change RVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or the ventricular end-systolic P/V relationships.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
