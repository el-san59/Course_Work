The authors report what may be the first recorded case of an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the ciliary body, possibly representing a one-sided differentiation of a malignant teratoid medulloepithelioma.\r"

Although the tumor appeared to be a ciliochoroidal melanoma, a melanocytoma and adenoma of the pigment epithelium also were considered in the differential diagnosis. The tumor was removed by a large partial lamellar sclerocyclochoroidectomy. Results of histopathologic evaluation showed a cystic adenoma of the pigmented ciliary epithelium. To the authors' knowledge, this was the first immunohistopathologic study of this tumor. Results of the study showed marked immunoreactivity for low molecular weight cytokeratins, vimentin, and S-100 protein. These immunohistochemical studies are consistent with the origin of this tumor from pigment epithelial cells.\r"

The mean delay between the initial and final surgery in the early group was 2.0 weeks; and, for the late group, 33.5 weeks. For those having reoperations, there was no difference in the number of procedures required to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Four patients (5 eyelids) with unsatisfactory results were offered, but declined, late repair. Early or late reoperation is effective in correcting unsatisfactory results after external levator resection. The benefits of early surgery are a reduction in time to final result, the ease with which it is performed, potential cost savings, and the opportunity one has to correct unsatisfactory results.\r"

Return to normal function of the traumatized orbital structures after medical and/or surgical intervention is anticipated. However, direct optic nerve injury with immediate visual field and/or acuity deficit is usually irreversible.\r"

Retained IOFBs presenting to The Medical College of Wisconsin between July 1986 and June 1989 were reviewed. A total of 27 cases were evaluated and surgically treated. None of the 27 cases presented with or developed clinical signs of endophthalmitis, yet bacterial cultures of the removed intraocular material were positive in seven cases (foreign body in 5 cases, the aqueous fluid and the vitreous fluid in 1 case each). All eyes presenting within 24 hours of injury underwent immediate surgery (average, 4.5 hours after presentation). Of the seven eyes with positive intraocular cultures, all had pars plana vitrectomy removal of the IOFB and three of these eyes received intravitreal antibiotics at the time of surgery over concern of a high risk of infection. Two of these eyes eventually grew out the Bacillus sp. All eyes received subconjunctival antibiotics and postoperative topical and systemic antibiotics. Even after the positive cultures, no signs of clinical infection developed in any of the eyes. All seven eyes retained excellent visual acuity of 20/70 or better at an average of 10 months' follow-up. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 31 months. Prompt surgical intervention, the use of intravitreal antibiotics in high-risk-type injuries, and the possible use of vitrectomy surgery may reduce the incidence and severity of endophthalmitis.\r"

Despite the many descriptions of this condition and possible treatment options, the long-term natural history is not well known. The authors identified 15 eyes of 15 consecutive patients seen over 21 years who were diagnosed with a serous detachment of the macula arising from an optic nerve pit. Average length of follow-up was 9 years. Twelve eyes lost three or more lines of vision, two eyes remained unchanged, and only one eye improved. All of the 12 eyes losing three or more lines of vision experienced this decrease within the first 6 months of follow-up. Although only two patients had a visual acuity of 20/200 or less initially, 12 of 15 patients had a visual acuity of 20/200 or less at the time of their last examination. The appearance of the macula at last examination included cystic changes of the neurosensory retina, full-thickness hole formation, retinal pigment epithelial mottling, and lamellar hole formation in the outer retinal layer. The long-term visual prognosis in patients with optic nerve pit and untreated serous retinal detachment of the macula is poor, and visual loss occurs within 6 months of the serous detachment.\r"

Eleven specimens contained long segment of ILM, as determined by light microscopy. With a minimum of 6 months of follow-up, none of these 11 eyes achieved a visual acuity of better than 20/60. Of 30 eyes that did not have ILM present, 41% achieved a visual acuity of 20/60 or better. Overall, 29% of the eyes in the entire series achieved 20/60 or better visual acuity. The difference between the group with ILM versus that without ILM was statistically significant (P = 0.01). The presence of long segments of ILM within the histopathologic specimen after vitreous surgery for removal of a macular ERM appears to indicate a less favorable visual outcome.\r"

Patients treated with both diode and argon green lasers required 4.5 +/- 1.8 times greater mean laser energy with diode compared with argon to create ophthalmoscopically similar lesions. Parallel experimental retinal photocoagulation in Chinchilla rabbits required 3.1 +/- 0.9 times more power to create ophthalmoscopically similar lesions with the diode laser than with the argon laser. Intraoperative subretinal hemorrhage occurred rarely in patients with an incidence of 4 (0.44%) of 9021 treatment spots. Patients complained of moderate-to-marked pain in 10 (43%) of 23 treatments initiated under topical anesthesia.

Postoperative complications are not infrequent compared to many other ophthalmic surgical procedures such as cataract extraction and strabismus repair. The surgeon must observe the eye carefully in the postoperative period to monitor and treat any complications as they arise.

The students' total and individual word-pair scores on the HTSS were then compared. The first comparison, between the PT students' and the OT students' views of the PT profession, indicated that the PT students' assessment of the PT profession was more positive than that of the OT students. The second comparison, between the OT students' and the PT students' views of the OT profession, indicated that the OT students' perception of the OT profession was more positive than that of the PT students. Each student group chose both positive and negative descriptors for the other group. Some positive adjectives chosen by the OT students to describe PT students were \"proud,\" \"passive,\" and \"precise.\" The PT students chose \"casual\" and \"intentional\" to positively describe OT students. Some negative adjectives chosen by the OT students to describe PT students were \"overrated,\" \"competitive,\" and \"strict.\" The PT students described OT students as \"passive,\" \"dull,\" and \"narrow.\" Both groups thought the other group was conventional and conservative.

  ".W": "Physical therapists often use transitional postures such as half-kneeling to help children with movement dysfunction attain an upright posture. Little is known, however, about how healthy children activate lower extremity muscles to move the hip, knee, and ankle joints as they move from kneeling through half-kneeling to stand up against gravity. The purpose of this study was to describe movement from kneeling to standing in 10 healthy 5- to 7-year-old children. Electromyography was used to record the activity of four lower extremity muscles. Cinematography was used to record joint motion of the hip, knee, and ankle of the leg initiating movement, in addition to trajectories of specific anatomical landmarks as the children rose from a kneeling to a standing position. Greater active range of motion of the hip, knee, and ankle was necessary to move from a kneeling to a standing position using the half-kneel transitional posture than is required during normal gait. The activation patterns of the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris muscles of the leg initiating movement exhibited variability among subjects during the kneel-to-stand movement. Maximum joint range of motion and position of the hip, knee, and ankle joints at specific points in the movement exhibited less variability than patterns of muscle activation. The results showed that movement from a kneeling to a standing position in healthy children is quantifiable and can be used to help determine what normal components of movement are necessary to successfully master this movement against gravity that is antecedent to ambulation. Further studies are needed to investigate antigravity movement in younger children and in children with movement dysfunction to more fully understand normal and abnormal movement in children.\r"

Its broad aim is to use robot technology to assist people with movement dysfunction. The neurologically impaired population might gain considerably from the provision of robots as \"assistants\" or \"therapy aides,\" but the interface with the machine must match both the physical and intellectual abilities of the user. We therefore consider a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing both behavioral and engineering perspectives, to be essential in achieving this aim. However, to date, published reports have been largely restricted to engineering journals or conference reports, and relatively little has appeared in the therapy literature. This article seeks to introduce physical therapists to robotics, describe possible applications to the rehabilitation of neurologically impaired patients, and suggest issues deserving further investigation.\r"

The purpose of this article is to illustrate the usefulness of examining these potentials. In addition to an overview of the topic, the article includes a report of a study demonstrating that there were differences between the brain potentials of five patients with traumatic brain injury and those of four healthy control subjects. All five patients were in the postacute phase of hemiplegia. Slow cortical potentials associated with simple goal-directed forearm and finger movements were recorded from frontal and parietal electrodes. Two seconds of movement-related electroencephalographic activity (movement-related potential) were recorded. The patients showed reduced brain potentials for movements associated with their paretic limb and, to a lesser extent, reduced brain potentials for movements associated with their nonparetic limb. The waveforms obtained from the patients were unusual, with uncharacteristic cross-cortical movement-related potential correlations associated with specific electrode configurations, as well as with specific movement conditions. Brain potentials associated with the fore-period interval of a simple reaction time paradigm were later recorded in two of the patients with traumatic brain injury and in a control subject to help determine the functional significance of the relative positivity apparent in their movement-related potential data. This preliminary study indicates that electroencephalographic potentials obtained during the preparation for and execution of movement can provide information regarding the basis for motor dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The primary concern of this article is to review experimental methods that may lead to a better understanding of the functional role of the basal ganglia in the control of movement. Two models of basal ganglia impairment are considered: Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The review focuses primarily on akinesia and bradykinesia because they are key abnormalities of basal ganglia dysfunction. In general, through electromyography and kinematic analysis of movement, it may be possible to characterize specific movement disorders. Specifically, if damage sustained by the central nervous system is traced to a certain structure, it may provide insight on the extent of involvement and functional role of that structure in the control of movement. Much of the data reviewed suggests that the basal ganglia may play a specific role in the initiation and regulation of force control.\r"

  ".W": "Historically, tissue expansion is a prolonged process, typically requiring at least 6 weeks to complete. Recently, interest has increased in shortening this time period. In the current study, a continuous infusion device maintaining constant expander pressure less than capillary filling pressure was used in a canine model in seven dogs to minimize the time period needed to achieve significant expansion. There were no complications, except one device malfunction, corrected by changes in design. The process was shown to be a safe and effective means of producing amounts of expansion similar to traditional methods in approximately 72 hours, with expansion of 28 percent (n = 6) for continuous tissue expansion (CTE) versus 34 percent (n = 6) for a 2-week rapid expansion protocol. This expansion was derived from either stretch of preexisting tissue (46 percent for CTE, 35 percent for 2-week expansion) or recruitment of adjacent tissue. The clinical application of continuous tissue expansion could permit the advantages of tissue expansion to be obtained in many more situations than are currently available to traditional tissue expansion techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of prefabricating free flaps by inducing, through the process of staged reconstruction, an arteriovenous bundle and its surrounding fascia to perfuse a selected block of tissue was investigated experimentally and clinically. Sixteen rat knee joints were wrapped with their ipsilateral superficial inferior epigastric (SIE) fascia. In 8 joints, the composite flaps were resected en bloc and were immediately replaced orthotopically pedicled upon the superficial inferior epigastric vessels. In the remaining joints, the resection and orthotopic transfer were performed 2 weeks later. Only the joints in the latter group, which benefited from the staging period, were found to be perfused. The long finger proximal interphalangeal joint of a child was reconstructed by the staged microvascular transfer of his second toe proximal interphalangeal joint. At the first stage, a temporalis fascia flap was wrapped around the toe proximal interphalangeal joint and revascularized to the dorsalis pedis vessels. Six weeks later, the joint and its temporalis fascia envelope were dissected, and the \"prefabricated\" joint flap was transferred to the hand and revascularized to the wrist vessels. Bony union progressed uneventfully with excellent recovery of the range of motion. We conclude that regardless of the indigenous vascular anatomy, an unlimited array of composite free flaps can be constructed and transferred based on induced large vascular pedicles.\r"

  ".W": "The appropriate method and timing of the management of the myelomeningocele defect have prompted considerable discussion. Use of split-thickness skin grafts acutely has accomplished wound closure with low morbidity and mortality. This study was designed to address the question of long-term suitability of the technique of split-thickness skin grafting of the myelomeningocele patient. The incidence of late and/or severe skin ulceration and the presence of gibbus deformity were correlated with the method of skin closure. Long-term follow-up revealed a higher incidence of chronic skin ulceration in the split-thickness skin graft group as compared with the primary closure group. All skin breakdowns appeared in the presence of a gibbus deformity, and gibbus deformity was more prevalent in the split-thickness skin graft group. The incidence of skin ulceration and gibbus deformity was site-dependent. A thoracic or thoracolumbar myelomeningocele repair with split-thickness skin graft was significantly more likely to be complicated by skin problems than the defect in the lumbar, lumbosacral, or sacral region. This relationship was secondary to the frequency of gibbus deformity in the more cephalad defects than defects caudad. A treatment plan is outlined that is based on the primary variable of the location of the myelomeningocele and secondarily by defect size.\r"

A pilot study (48 animals, 8 groups) examined variables associated with the method and timing of surgical repair, the arrest of wallerian degeneration, and the role of pulsing electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF) in functional recovery. A second phase (90 animals, 6 groups) then studied the timing and duration of pulsing electromagnetic field therapy as the only variable in larger groups of animals. The pilot study revealed that a vein-graft conduit did not improve functional recovery compared with standard epineurial repair. Additionally, delayed repair compared favorably with immediate repair. The use of chlorpromazine to inhibit the toxic effects of calcium influx appeared to enhance early functional recovery, and the combination of delayed nerve repair and pulsing electromagnetic field therapy seemed to consistently improve function. The second phase of the study has demonstrated (for the first time) statistical improvement in ambulation in animals treated with delayed surgical repair and prolonged pulsing electromagnetic field therapy. We postulate that future treatment of nerve transection injuries will involve a combined treatment regimen consisting of the immediate arrest of wallerian degeneration, delayed surgery, and pulsing electromagnetic field therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of buflomedil to protect skin tissue from ischemia and necrosis was studied in random cutaneous flaps. Measurements were performed by intravital microscopy on the microcirculatory level of capillary perfusion in a flap model in the hairless mouse. In 30 hairless mice, single-pedicle flaps measuring 6 x 16 mm were raised perpendicular to the spine of the animal. This flap develops a reliable amount of necrosis at its distal edge over a period of 7 days. A group of 10 mice received intravenous injections of buflomedil in doses of 3 mg/kg per day diluted in 0.1 ml normal saline beginning 4 hours before flap elevation and for 6 consecutive days postoperatively. In addition, 10 further animals received the same treatment except that it was started 5 minutes after flap elevation. In 10 mice serving as controls, normal saline in equal volumes as in the experimental groups was applied. By means of intravital microscopy, functional vessel density (FVD) was determined in 2.5-mm increments from the flap's base to its distal edge at 1, 6, and 24 hours after elevation. Skin-flap survival was quantified by measuring the necrotic area on day 7 by means of digital planimetry. Functional vessel density was preserved in the distal flap of animals pretreated with buflomedil, revealing a higher functional vessel density at 10.0 mm (p less than 0.01), 12.5 mm (p less than 0.05), and 15.0 mm (p less than 0.001) from the flap's base as compared with controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-three of these 70 twins exhibited one or more craniofacial anomalies; these were analyzed for dysmorphic characteristics, zygosity, concordance, and family history. The anomalies were categorized into two groups: malformations and deformations.

  ".W": "Congenital blepharophimosis is a congenital anomaly characterized by abnormalities in the area of the eyes, including bilateral ptosis, shortening of the horizontal fissure of the lid, expansion of the intercanthal distance, and epicanthus inversus. The condition is subject to autosomal-dominant heredity and is said to occur more frequently in Orientals than in Occidentals. Over the past 9 years, we have surgically treated 11 cases of congenital blepharophimosis using a procedure in which levator resection and medial canthoplasty are performed in one stage. It has been commonly believed that when levator resection and medial canthoplasty are performed at the same time, tension in the eyelid becomes too strong to achieve favorable results; therefore, the standard procedure has been to divide the operation into two stages. In all 11 cases we experienced, however, it was possible to obtain good results with a single-stage operation.\r"

Measured amounts of that muscle were surgically excised from both upper eyelids in six cynomolgus monkeys. All the eyelids were photographed and videotaped at progressively increased intervals to permit the evaluation of wound healing, scarring, and function. Our preliminary results revealed that the excision of preseptal and partial supraorbital orbicularis oculi muscle, preseptal and complete supraorbital muscle, or pretarsal muscle only did not result in lagophthalmos. Complete resection of pretarsal, preseptal, and supraorbital orbicularis oculi did result in lagophthalmos but caused no corneal injury. The orbicularis oculi muscle in the cynomolgus monkey is similar to that in humans, but it is not yet clear whether our findings in the monkey are applicable in humans. A determination of the maximum amount of orbicularis oculi muscle that can safely be excised in humans would enable plastic surgeons to better understand and develop techniques for eyelid reconstruction and blepharoplasty.\r"

The clinical characteristics of port-wine stains in 170 children are discussed. Good to excellent results (moderate to complete clearing) in port-wine stains were obtained in 60 percent of patients and seemed to correlate best with lack of blanchability on pressure. Hypertrophic scarring was seen in only 7 children, all of whom had undressed wounds; no significant scarring has been seen in any subsequent child who had maintained a dressed wound postoperatively.\r"

In the field of augmentation rhinoplasty, many kinds of materials, such as bone, septal cartilage, ear cartilage, and prostheses, were used. In this paper, we limit discussion to our experience with the technique for the augmentation of the nasal dorsum using the ear cartilage and compare this with other materials. Patient ages ranged from 15 to 72 years, with an average of 24 years. Some 95 percent of patients (1199) were female, and only 5 percent (64) were male. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 20 months, with average follow-up only 8 months. Of course, we know that this is a very short follow-up period, but we could not follow patients longer because if they had no complaint about the results at the 6-month visit, they never returned, despite our efforts. Five-hundred and ten of the 1263 patients (40 percent) had been augmented elsewhere, and the silicone prosthesis was already in place. However, 753 patients (60 percent) had no previous operation. For the 510 patients (secondary rhinoplasty patients), too-high or too-large a prosthesis was the largest complaint in number, totaling 378 cases (74 percent), and psychological dissatisfaction, such as pain or an uncomfortable sensation, was the second largest in number, totaling 104 cases (20 percent). For the 753 patients (primary rhinoplasty patients), the main complaint was too-short or too-flat a nose (100 percent).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The use of prosthetic mesh has significant drawbacks, and the use of pedicled myofascial and myocutaneous flaps should be advantageous. We present 15 consecutive cases demonstrating highly successful reconstructions of massive abdominal wall defects using myofascial and myocutaneous flaps without prosthetic mesh. The extended rectus femoris flap, or \"mutton chop\" flap, which is capable of resurfacing the epigastrium, is described. Complications were minimal, and use of myofascial units, particularly the rectus femoris, should be considered as the technique of choice for reconstruction of major abdominal wall deficits.\r"

Postoperative skin condition was evaluated first in the immediate postoperative period (second or third day); then at a more remote date (after at least 2 months of follow-up). On the body, restoration of the preoperative condition of the skin was obtained in 94.6 percent of treatment sites in the immediate postoperative period; after a longer follow-up, this proportion was 87.9 percent because of delayed development of modifications. The time interval needed to obtain a stable result increased with increasing age, regardless of the nature of this result, as well as with the total amount of fat removed. On the neck, liposuction improved or even eliminated preexisting skin looseness, and this improvement was even more noticeable as follow-up increased. The neck thus appears as the site of choice for suction lipectomy. On the face, in contrast, favorable results deteriorated over time, a finding that leads me to advocate combination with a face-lift whenever ptosis is present. Thus treatment site obviously has a substantial impact on the potential of the skin for retracting postoperatively.\r"

Except in one case, tracheostomy was avoided, thanks to intranasal intubation by fibroscopy. These children, aged 2 to 9 years, underwent 31 general anesthesias and complex reconstructive procedures, including latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous pedunculated and free flaps, cranial flaps with galea, cranial bone and skin grafts, and retroauricular temporal skin flaps.

Twenty-three rabbits received hydroxyapatite implants (10 x 10 x 2 mm) prepared with and without osteoinductive protein. These were implanted on the frontal bone and secured by wire fixation after 0.25 mm of the cortical surface was abraded. The implants were harvested at 3 and 4 months and analyzed for percentage of bone ingrowth by histologic examination of decalcified H&E sections and by scanning electron microscope backscatter image analysis. The osteoinductive protein-treated implants demonstrated significantly greater amounts of bone ingrowth at both 3 (52.0 versus 10.3 percent; p less than 0.001) and 4 months (66.1 versus 39.2 percent; p less than 0.005) than the untreated implants. The type of bone found in all osteoinductive protein-treated implants was predominantly lamellar. Untreated implants contained mostly woven bone at 3 months, with increasing amounts of lamellar bone appearing at 4 months. These results suggest that the combination of a bone-inducing protein and a suitable osteoconductive matrix may provide an alternative to bone grafting.\r"

  ".W": "An animal model was developed to determine the feasibility of vascularizing a porous biomaterial and transferring it as part of a free flap to a recipient site with enhanced resistance to infection due to the maintenance of a blood supply. To that end, the experiment was divided into three stages. Stage 1 compared the soft-tissue response of Interpore-200 to Interpore-500, both continuously porous hydroxyapatite materials implanted beneath the panniculus carnosus of the male Sprague-Dawley rat. Pore size was an important factor as it influenced vascular ingrowth, with Interpore-200 vascularizing earlier (complete at 1 week) and more intensely. Interpore-200 was therefore used for the remainder of the experiment. After 1 week of tissue ingrowth, the implants were moved from the abdomen to the skull on a vascular pedicle as a \"biocomposite\" free flap. Stage 2 was the histologic evaluation of 15 \"biocomposite\" free flaps over various time intervals up to 8 months. The free flaps formed a fibrous union to the skull, while a simple nonvascularized Interpore-200 onlay graft (stage 2 control) demonstrated a bony union in three of four implants placed up to 2 months. Stage 3 confirmed the free flap's resistance to bacterial infection. A highly significant difference (p less than 0.005) in infection rates was demonstrated between the \"biocomposite\" and nonvascularized stage 3 controls with no Pseudomonas growth from 9 of 10 cultures of the free flaps 5 days after exposure to 10(4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while stage 3 controls demonstrated Pseudomonas growth in all cultures (heavy growth in 8 of 10). The \"biocomposite\" free flap has excellent potential to provide form and structure to wounds requiring reconstruction where bacterial contamination is a significant risk factor.\r"

Physiologic gradients in ventilation, perfusion, and lymph flow and stresses in the lung are present in the axial plane. Anatomic difference in branching patterns, interstitial design, and development of the secondary pulmonary lobules are also found. These regional disparities in anatomy and physiology can be applied to an old concept--the corticomedullary organization of the lung--and are used to consider why some diseases exhibit a propensity for the central or peripheral portions of the lung. The same analysis is applied to the anatomy and physiology in the secondary pulmonary lobule.\r"

Magnetic resonance examinations were performed on 23 patients with biopsy-proved cirrhosis. A \"nodule-within-nodule\" appearance was noted in two patients. This appearance consisted of markedly low intensity of a large nodule on gradient-echo images, with one or two internal foci that were isointense to the liver. Each of the large nodules was 2 cm in diameter, and each of the internal foci was less than 1 cm. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were normal in both patients. Aspiration biopsy performed in one patient failed to show malignancy, but histologic confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma was obtained eventually in both cases. The nodule-within-nodule sign, which reflects the unique histopathology of hepatocellular carcinoma in large siderotic regenerative nodules, is strongly suggestive of early hepatocellular carcinoma, even if serologic markers and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.\r"

The indication for ESWL was failure of, or anticipated difficulty with, basket extraction of the stones via a T-tube tract. A piezoelectric lithotriptor was used in all procedures. The average total number of shock waves administered was 29,756 (range, 10,000-61,395).

In a clinical validation study with actual brain images of 10 human subjects, the average coefficient of variation between observers for the measurement of absolute brain and CSF volumes was 1.2% and 6.4%, respectively. The intraclass correlations for three expert operators is greater than .99 in the measurement of brain and ventricular volumes and greater than .94 for total CSF volume. Therefore, the authors believe that their technique to analyze MR images of the brain performed with acceptable levels of accuracy and reliability and that it can be used to measure brain and CSF volumes for clinical research. This technique could be helpful in the correlation of neuroanatomic measurements to behavioral and physiologic parameters in neuropsychiatric disorders.\r"

Ventricular and extraventricular CSF was quantified, and the effects of aging were studied; in both groups, the atrophy measurement was used to correct metabolic values obtained with positron emission tomography. Patients with Alzheimer dementia had higher total CSF; extraventricular, total ventricular, and third ventricular CSF volumes (49%, 37%, 99%, and 74%, respectively); and 7% lower brain volumes than the control group. The patients also showed a more marked decline in brain volumes and a greater increase in CSF volumes with advancing age than the control group. They had a 25.0% increase in corrected whole-brain metabolic rates; the control group had only a 15.8% increase. The use of this technique may provide a basis for further studies of aging and dementia, including regional volume analysis.\r"

MR images regarded as positive included those showing atrophy and/or white matter lesions. On the basis of these criteria, 96 subjects had normal MR images and 23 had abnormal images. Results of chi 2 analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the asymptomatic group (12 of 95 [13%] with abnormal scans) and the symptomatic group (11 of 24 [46%] with abnormal scans) (P = .001). In the asymptomatic group, positive MR images showed fewer, smaller, and/or less extensive abnormalities. The researchers conclude that (a) MR imaging can show indirect evidence of HIV infection early in the disease, but abnormalities will be minor and seen only in a small minority of neurologically asymptomatic subjects; (b) the appearance of clinically recognizable neurologic disease correlates with the MR imaging findings of increasingly severe brain atrophy and white matter lesions; and (c) in some HIV-seropositive subjects, despite neurologic disease, MR images can remain normal. Results indicate that routine screening with cranial MR imaging of neurologically asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals would likely result in a low yield of positive findings.\r"

The three-dimensional reconstructed images of the inner ear were directly synthesized from two-dimensional images of the temporal bone region by means of an external processing computer. With use of three-dimensional reconstructed images and stereoscopic observations, structures inside the temporal bone region and the positional relationship among them were easily recognized. These structures are difficult to demonstrate with two-dimensional images. This three-dimensional method was also shown to be useful for recognition of disease and anatomic malformations in the temporal bone region.\r"

More often, however, a choanal polyp is an antrochoanal polyp, which arises from the maxillary antrum, protrudes through the middle meatus, extends into the nasal cavity, and continues back to the choana. Contiguous axial or coronal magnetic resonance and CT images help clearly differentiate the rare sphenochoanal polyp from the more common antrochoanal polyp. The sinus of origin is important to identify, as the surgical approach depends on the target sinus.\r"

Of these cases, 185 (9.4%) involved invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Mammography in 137 cases demonstrated the following findings: spiculated opacity (53%), architectural distortion (16%), poorly defined opacity (7%), normal or benign findings (16%), and parenchymal asymmetry (4%). Radiographic definition of the ILC lesion varied greatly with projection: The craniocaudal view demonstrated significant findings more frequently than either the oblique or lateral views. Secondary radiographic findings were present in 31%, microcalcifications were rare, and physical findings were present in 89%. Because of its diffuse growth pattern and tendency to form lesions with opacity equal to or less than that of the parenchyma, ILC can be extremely difficult to detect mammographically. Therefore, the radiologist must be alert for subtle mammographic signs of malignancy and highly suspicious of any abnormal physical findings regardless of the mammographic appearance.\r"

Radiographs of the surgical specimen failed to confirm excision of 11 lesions (5.5%), seven calcified and four noncalcified. These 11 patients were taken directly from the surgical suite to the radiology suite, where an immediate postoperative mammogram was obtained. In five patients (2.5%), immediate postoperative mammograms showed surgical failure with the lesion still present. In six patients (3.0%), immediate postoperative mammograms showed that the lesion had been removed, even though the lesion had not been identified on surgical-specimen radiographs. No errors occurred in the interpretation of immediate postoperative mammograms, a fact corroborated by examination of surgical specimens obtained at repeat surgery in three patients and identification of skin calcifications in two patients, and with follow-up mammograms in six patients. Whenever a discrepancy between preoperative localization radiographs and surgical-specimen radiographs exists, the authors suggest immediate postoperative mammography to improve the diagnostic process.\r"

Fifty patients with normal results of thoracic computed tomography (CT) and 25 with unilateral or bilateral hilar masses or adenopathy (defined as opacity greater than 10 mm in diameter) were selected retrospectively. Patients with concomitant pulmonary masses or consolidation at CT that might be confused with or obscure an inferior hilar mass or adenopathy were excluded from study. The 75 corresponding lateral chest radiographs were then evaluated blindly. Forty-seven of the 50 normal cases were correctly interpreted (specificity = 94%). The anterior walls of the right and left lower lobe bronchi were seen in 36% and 84% of normal cases, respectively; the average thickness was 2 mm. Of the 25 patients with inferior hilar masses, 22 were recognized as having abnormalities (sensitivity = 88%); two of the three patients with false-negative results had right hilar masses. Overall accuracy was 92%. For only eight (32%) of the 25 patients was the laterality of abnormality correctly diagnosed. Evaluation of the inferior hilar window on lateral chest radiographs is accurate in assessing the presence or absence of inferior hilar mass or adenopathy.\r"

The six SR algorithms varied among each other in only one image parameter. One algorithm approximated conventional image characteristics. The other five algorithms were designed to optimize imaging of the mediastinum and tested the effects of gray-scale reversal, adjustment of optical density, a linear instead of a sigmoid gradation curve, and moderate edge enhancement of high and medium spatial frequencies. Performance was evaluated by calculating the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) of 5,040 observations by six readers. Post-processing with high-frequency edge enhancement and density optimization for the mediastinum significantly improved performance of SR over FR in the detection of mediastinal lesions (Az = .80 +/- .02 vs .73 +/- .01, respectively). Gray-scale reversal significantly decreased performance (Az = .64 +/- .03). All SR algorithms that were postprocessed to optimize imaging of the mediastinum were significantly inferior to FR in the detection of pulmonary lesions.\r"

Data compression techniques are being developed to address this problem, but significant image deterioration can occur at high compression ratios. In this study, the authors evaluated a form of adaptive block cosine transform coding, a new compression technique that allows considerable compression of digital radiographs with minimal degradation of image quality. To determine the effect of data compression on diagnostic accuracy, observer tests were performed with 60 digitized chest radiographs (2,048 x 2,048 matrix, 1,024 shades of gray) containing subtle examples of pneumothorax, interstitial infiltrate, nodules, and bone lesions. Radiographs with no compression, with 25:1 compression, and with 50:1 compression ratios were presented in randomized order to 12 radiologists. The results suggest that, with this compression scheme, compression ratios as high as 25:1 may be acceptable for primary diagnosis in chest radiology.\r"

To determine the best imaging strategy for ultrafast CT of the pediatric airway, the authors prospectively compared ultrafast CT and endoscopy in 20 children. Both studies were performed in 11 patients; cine CT alone was performed in six and high-resolution CT alone in three. Six patients had normal anatomy. Six patients had focal tracheal stenoses, four had tracheomalacia or laryngomalacia, one had a laryngoesophageal cleft, one had irregularity and narrowing in the subglottic area, one had laryngeal papillomas, and one had focal stenosis with stoma granuloma. Cine CT results agreed with those of endoscopy in 10 of 17 cases. In five cases focal stenosis was misinterpreted with cine CT as tracheomalacia. High-resolution CT results agreed with those of endoscopy in 10 of 14 cases. The results of a technique that combined high-resolution CT for the entire airway and cine CT at selected areas agreed with those of endoscopy in 10 of 11 cases; only a tracheoesophageal cleft was missed with the combined technique. For the greatest diagnostic accuracy with ultrafast CT in evaluation of the pediatric airway, both cine and high-resolution modes should be used.\r"

The authors compared the clinical significance of palpable prostate cancer with nonpalpable prostate cancer discovered with transrectal ultrasound (US). A strong association between lesion volume measured with preoperative transrectal US and volumetric measurements in 60 radical prostatectomy specimens permitted the use of tumor size measured with transrectal US as a reasonable estimation of gross tumor volume. In a subsequent clinical series, 147 biopsy-proved cancers were grouped according to size measured at US, the findings at digital rectal examination (DRE), and the Gleason score. For the 147 patients with known prostate cancer, a statistically significant difference between Gleason scores of palpable and nonpalpable cancers could not be demonstrated when the size of the tumor and its location within the prostate were held constant. Assuming that the Gleason score is a reliable indication of malignant potential and clinical significance, the authors conclude that nonpalpable prostatic cancer detected with transrectal US alone may be just as clinically significant as prostatic cancer discovered with DRE.\r"

Carcinoma was detected in 99 patients, by means of both palpation and endosonography (n = 80), endosonography alone (n = 9), and palpation alone (n = 8); two cancers were not detected with either palpation or endosonography. All patients with normal results of digital examination had a combined grade-stage category score lower than 9.

Although the number of patients is small, these data suggest that nonpalpable cancers are biologically less aggressive than palpable ones and that the advantage of endosonography over palpation in detection of clinically significant cancers is limited.\r"

A new echogenic contrast medium for ultrasound was administered transcervically with conventional tools for hysterosalpingography or a balloon catheter. The flow of multiple fractions of the contrast medium through each fallopian tube was observed in real time in appropriate imaging planes by means of a transvaginal probe. All patent tubes were diagnosed correctly with HyCoSy, results comparing well with findings at hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy. With B-mode scanning only, sensitivity was 88% for the right tube and 90% for the left; specificity was 100% for each tube. The supplementary use of Doppler techniques (duplex, color Doppler) provided additional information in special cases of suspected tubal occlusion and led to an improvement in diagnostic accuracy. The contrast agent was well tolerated. HyCoSy demonstrates normal anatomy and tubal patency with high reliability and permits advance selection of patients in whom more invasive diagnostic procedures may be required.\r"

These arteries were assessed preoperatively with arch aortography performed after conventional high translumbar peripheral aortography by exchanging the initial 16-gauge sheath for a 5-F pigtail catheter. Thirty-two diagnostic translumbar runoff and arch (TLR-arch) aortograms were obtained in 30 patients with advanced lower extremity ischemia. In six patients (20%), the results of the arch study influenced the choice of an inflow site. These patients were compared with 70 control subjects who underwent conventional translumbar aortography without arch studies. In the TLR-arch group, two major complications occurred in one patient, while in the control group 11 major complications occurred in 10 patients. One retroperitoneal hematoma occurred in the TLR-arch group; two occurred in the control group. The mean change in hematocrit for the TLR-arch group was -3.81% (-0.0381), and for the control group it was -4.17% (-0.0417). This difference was not statistically significant. Arch aortography is a valuable adjunct to the translumbar aortofemoral study. It can be simply performed without increasing the morbidity of the peripheral study.\r"

In vitro use of rotating disk and stenotic flow phantoms confirmed that the 3.6-msec TE sequence enables accurate measurement of jet velocities of up to 6.0 m/sec (r = .996). Peak jet velocity measurements were made with MR imaging in 36 patients with stenosis of native heart valves (n = 9), conduits (n = 19), or Fontan connections (n = 2) or with aortic coarctation (n = 6). Peak velocity measurements made with MR imaging agreed well with measurements made with Doppler ultrasound (US), which were available in 18 cases (standard deviation = 0.2 m/sec). Velocity mapping with fast-echo MR imaging is likely to have considerable importance as a noninvasive means of locating and evaluating stenoses, particularly at sites inaccessible to US, but care must be taken to prevent errors caused by malalignment, signal loss, phase wrap, or partial-volume effects.\r"

In four patients with episodic hypoglycemia, calcium gluconate (0.01-0.025 mEq Ca2+/kg) was injected directly into branches of the celiac plexus (gastroduodenal, splenic, and hepatic arteries) and the superior mesenteric artery. In all patients, serum levels of insulin rose abruptly in blood samples taken from the right hepatic vein 30 and 60 seconds after the infusion of calcium into the artery supplying the tumor; injection into an artery not supplying the tumor did not result in a similar rise. Accurate localization of the insulinomas was verified at surgery in three patients. In the fourth patient, who did not undergo surgery, arteriographic results were positive for insulinoma at the predicted site. On the basis of these results, the authors believe noninvasive ASVS may replace invasive portal venous sampling as the most effective method for the localization of occult insulinomas.\r"

The initial pharmacomechanical method (used in 65 cases) employed clot maceration with hook-shaped catheters and clot lacing with highly concentrated urokinase. The current technique (used in 56 cases) consisted of pulsed-spray injection of urokinase into the clot. All fully treated grafts (117 cases) underwent complete or near-complete thrombolysis, and 93% remained patent after 1 day. Mean time for pulsed-spray lysis was 46 minutes +/- 21. One patient (less than 1%) had gastrointestinal bleeding and received a transfusion; minor complications occurred in 3% of patients. Primary and secondary graft patency rates for both methods at 1 year were 26% and 51%, respectively. While graft age and results of angioplasty did not influence future graft patency, shorter intervals between graft thromboses was predictive of earlier subsequent graft failure. Results suggest that pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and angioplasty provide rapid, consistent, and safe recanalization of clotted hemodialysis grafts and represent a promising additional therapeutic approach to long-term graft management.\r"

Use of large-caliber portacaval shunts, however, results in the complete decompression of the portal system and the risk of subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy. Use of small-caliber portacaval shunts results in mild portal hypertension and less frequent hepatic encephalopathy but may increase the risk of recurrent bleeding. Thirty-three patients underwent angiography after partial decompression portacaval shunting (median trans-shunt pressures, 8 mm Hg). Embolization of residual varices, noted in 13 patients, was performed. Results included one complication with no sequelae and no bleeding a mean of 13 months after the procedure was performed. Trans-shunt embolization of esophageal varices effectively prevents bleeding varices after partial portal decompression.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the increasing use of percutaneous fine-needle biopsy of abdominal lesions is associated with an increase in serious complications, the author updated a literature search and evaluated a questionnaire (distributed among selected hospitals in the United States in 1986 and 1987) that followed up a questionnaire distributed in 1983. The updated literature review revealed a total of 24 deaths and 20 needle tract seedings. The updated questionnaire revealed five deaths after 16,381 biopsies (0.031%), whereas the previous questionnaire had shown four deaths after 63,108 biopsies (0.006%). Two similar European questionnaires revealed mortality rates of 0.008% and 0.018%, respectively. Of the total of 33 deaths, 21 involved biopsies of liver lesions; six involved pancreatic biopsies. Seventeen of the 21 deaths after liver biopsies were secondary to hemorrhage; five of the six deaths after pancreatic biopsies were due to pancreatitis. Of the 23 instances of needle tract seeding, 10 occurred after biopsies of pancreatic malignancies. The frequencies of needle tract seeding in the four questionnaires were 0.005%, 0.006%, 0.003%, and 0.009%, respectively. Although infrequent, serious complications may be associated with this procedure. The author makes suggestions that may help minimize them.\r"

The duration of hemodialysis is probably the greatest risk factor for development of these intraosseous amyloidomas. Ultrastructurally, this new type of amyloid originates from beta 2-microglobulin, a low-molecular-weight serum protein that is not filtered by standard dialysis membranes.\r"

However, compared with imaging after single injection of contrast material into the radiocarpal joint, triple-injection arthrography not only increases patient expense but also significantly increases the time required of both patients and arthrographers to obtain the diagnosis. With the goal of decreasing the number of triple injections, the author reviewed 50 consecutive triple-injection wrist arthrograms. Using a technique based on high-volume injection of contrast material to achieve complete distention of the joint, the author achieved a false-negative rate for demonstration of complete perforations with radiocarpal injection alone of only 2% (10% if partial perforations were included). In none of these cases was patient treatment altered by the additional information provided by the second and third injections. This false-negative rate is significantly lower than that reported previously and raises the question of whether there are circumstances in which the easier and less time-consuming single radiocarpal injection might be appropriate.\r"

Occult subcortical femoral and tibial fractures were identified in 72% of patients. A modified MR imaging classification is suggested based on a combination of the appearances of such lesions at MR imaging and their short-term osteochondral sequelae. Among 67% of a cohort of 21 patients first seen with what have been described as occult geographic subcortical fractures, osteochondral sequelae were seen at follow-up MR imaging 6-12 months later. The evidence from this study indicates that specific subcategories of occult subcortical knee fractures are associated with an inordinately high prevalence of osteochondral sequelae, especially significant cartilage damage.\r"

  ".W": "Bilateral simultaneous sampling of the inferior petrosal sinuses is an extremely sensitive, specific, and accurate test for diagnosing Cushing disease and distinguishing between that entity and the ectopic ACTH syndrome. It is also valuable for lateralizing small hormone-producing adenomas within the pituitary gland. The inferior petrosal sinuses connect the cavernous sinuses with the ipsilateral internal jugular veins. The anatomy of the anastomoses between the inferior petrosal sinus, the internal jugular vein, and the venous plexuses at the base of the skull varies, but it is almost always possible to catheterize the inferior petrosal sinus. In addition, variations in size and anatomy are often present between the two inferior petrosal sinuses in a patient. Advance preparation is required for petrosal sinus sampling. Teamwork is a critical element, and each member of the staff should know what he or she will be doing during the procedure. The samples must be properly labeled, processed, and stored. Specific needles, guide wires, and catheters are recommended for this procedure. The procedure is performed with specific attention to the three areas of potential technical difficulty: catheterization of the common femoral veins, crossing the valve at the base of the left internal jugular vein, and selective catheterization of the inferior petrosal sinuses. There are specific methods for dealing with each of these areas. The sine qua non of correct catheter position in the inferior petrosal sinus is demonstration of reflux of contrast material into the ipsilateral cavernous sinus. Images must always be obtained to document correct catheter position. Special attention must be paid to two points to prevent potential complications: The patient must be given an adequate dose of heparin, and injection of contrast material into the inferior petrosal sinuses and surrounding veins must be done gently and carefully. When the procedure is performed as outlined, both inferior petrosal sinuses can be catheterized in more than 98% of patients. The complication rate is low, and the theoretical risk of major morbidity or death is less than 1% (neither has yet occurred, to our knowledge). The most common complication is groin hematoma.\r"

Group 1 consisted of 81 patients without suspected pharyngeal or esophageal disease who demonstrated what was considered to be normal anatomy on all radiographic views. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients who were known or suspected to have pathologic abnormality of the pharynx. The members of this latter group each demonstrated various abnormal pharyngeal anatomy on the standard views. In just over half of these cases the oblique projection contributed significant information not obtained with conventional views. Therefore, the authors conclude that oblique images are a beneficial addition to the diagnostic evaluation of patients highly suspected of having pharyngeal disease.\r"

Flat (incomplete) erosions were detected with endoscopy only and were considered to be present in 42 patients (11.2%). Varioliform (complete) erosions were identified with both radiography and endoscopy in 12 patients (3.2%). For the detection of varioliform erosions, a substantial agreement beyond chance between both modalities was found (kappa = 0.73; standard error, 0.12). Thus, flat erosions were detected with endoscopy only, whereas state-of-the-art radiography and endoscopy were equally sensitive for detecting varioliform erosions. Histologic confirmation of erosions was obtained in only 75% of the patients. It is unknown whether the demonstration of erosions with radiography and/or endoscopy correlates with dyspepsia.\r"

The authors investigated the effects of echo-time (TE) minimization and fat suppression on MR images of the liver and pancreas. Two sets of MR images were obtained with identical repetition times and other parameters. In 10 subjects with seven liver lesions, images with TEs of 20 and 12 msec were compared. In 18 additional subjects with seven liver lesions and five pancreatic carcinomas, images with identical TEs but with and without fat suppression were compared. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were greater with a TE of 12 msec than with a TE of 20 msec for liver versus spleen (7.6 vs 4.9, P = .014) and liver versus lesion (6.9 vs 3.9, P = .031). In patients without fatty liver, CNR for six lesions versus liver was greater (9.5 vs 6.0, P = .014) with fat suppression. CNR between glandular pancreas and cancer was most conspicuous with fat suppression, but fat planes were less distinct. Minimization of TE improves T1-weighted images significantly. Fat suppression also improves CNR, but the disadvantages of fat suppression do not allow elimination of conventional T1-weighted images.\r"

Significant enhancement of the liver-to-tumor C/N and/or improved visualization of small lesions was consistently observed on T1-weighted images obtained after injection of the contrast material. For intrahepatic implants, the C/N on postinjection T1-weighted images was superior to that on T1- and T2-weighted preinjection images. For the C-26 metastatic liver lesions of larger diameter (greater than 5 mm), the C/N on postinjection T1-weighted studies was superior to that on preinjection T1-weighted images but was comparable to that on preinjection T2-weighted images. However, higher C/N after administration of Fe-EHPG improved visualization of medium-sized (3-5 mm) and small (1-3-mm) metastatic lesions in both M5076 and C-26 models. These results demonstrate that MR imaging with appropriate hepatobiliary agents appears promising for early detection of liver metastases.\r"

To determine whether differences in nodal distribution and appearance can be reliably used to distinguish between sarcoidosis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the authors retrospectively reviewed the abdominal and pelvic CT scans of 16 patients with biopsy-proved sarcoidosis and 20 patients with biopsy-proved NHL. Eleven of the 16 patients with sarcoidosis had abdominal and/or pelvic lymphadenopathy, which was common at all nodal sites except for the retrocrural and pelvic locations. There was a statistically significant lower frequency of retrocrual adenopathy in sarcoidosis than in NHL. Mean nodal size was significantly greater in NHL. Nodes tended to be confluent in NHL and discrete in sarcoidosis. Hepatomegaly was seen in six of the 16 patients (38%) with sarcoidosis and splenomegaly was present in nine of 15 (60%). CT depicted hepatic lesions in only three of eight patients (38%) with biopsy-proved hepatic involvement. Splenic lesions were seen at CT in five of the 15 patients (33%). The authors believe that the overlap in nodal appearance and distribution poses a limitation for use of these criteria in accurate disease characterization.\r"

The final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 54 patients and chronic pancreatitis in 27 patients. CA 19-9 assessment, US, CT, and FNAB were considered nondiagnostic, respectively, in 0%, 25%, 19%, and 6% of cases. When a definite diagnosis was rendered, the positive predictive value was 90% for CA 19-9 assessment, 95% for US, 98% for CT, and 100% for FNAB; the negative predictive value was, respectively, 69%, 95%, 86%, and 100%. The accuracy of all diagnostic and nondiagnostic studies was 81% for CA 19-9 assessment, 72% for US, 77% for CT, and 94% for FNAB. It is concluded that CT-guided pancreatic FNAB is the most reliable examination for enabling differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. When the pancreas is well visualized at US, the negative predictive value for pancreatic cancer is more accurate than that of CA 19-9 assessment and CT.\r"

Spacing patterns, in which an array of two or more cell types forms from a uniform field of cells, are a common feature of development. Identical precursor cells may adopt different fates because of competition and inhibition between them. Such a pattern in the developing Drosophila eye is the evenly spaced array of R8 cells, around which other cell types are subsequently recruited. Genetic studies suggest that the scabrous mutation disrupts a signal produced by R8 cells that inhibits other cells from also becoming R8 cells. The scabrous locus was cloned, and it appears to encode a secreted protein partly related to the beta and gamma chains of fibrinogen. It is proposed that the sca locus encodes a lateral inhibitor of R8 differentiation. The roles of the Drosophila EGF-receptor homologue (DER) and Notch genes in this process were also investigated.\r"

Partial complementary DNA clones have been obtained for a rice nuclear protein, designated GT-2, that binds in a highly sequence-specific fashion to this motif. Mutational analysis shows that the paired G's are most crucial to binding. GT-2 has domains related to certain other transcription factors.

The type III protein resides in the sensory neuronal cilia, which project into the nasal lumen and are accessible to airborne odorants. The enzymatic activity of the type III adenylyl cyclase appears to differ from nonsensory cyclases. The large difference seen between basal and stimulated activity for the type III enzyme could allow considerable modulation of the intracellular cAMP concentration. This property may represent one mechanism of achieving sensitivity in odorant perception.\r"

Furthermore, nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) were observed between the zeta 3 and epsilon 3 protons of the methylleucine (MeLeu) residue at position 9 of CsA and tryptophan121 (Trp121) and phenylalanine (Phe) protons of cyclophilin, suggesting that the MeLeu9 residue of CsA interacts with cyclophilin.

Ramp releases, which decreased fiber length at constant speed, caused a lattice expansion. After the ramp, increasing tension during recovery was accompanied by lattice compression. Ramp stretches caused a compression of the lattice. While the fiber was held at a constant length after the stretch, tension decreased and lattice spacing increased. These observations demonstrate the existence of a previously undetected radial component of the force generated by a cycling crossbridge. At sarcomere lengths of 2.05 to 2.2 micrometers, the radial force compresses the myofilament lattice. Hence, the myofilament lattice does not maintain a constant volume during changes in force.\r"

  ".W": "The polymerization of actin filaments is involved in growth, movement, and cell division. It has been shown that actin polymerization is controlled by gelsolin, whose interactions with actin are activated by calcium ion (Ca2+) and inhibited by membrane polyphosphoinositides (PPI). A smaller Ca2(+)- and PPI-regulated protein, gCap39, which has 49% sequence identity with gelsolin, has been identified by cDNA cloning and protein purification. Like gelsolin, gCap39 binds to the fast-growing (+) end of actin filaments. However, gCap39 does not sever actin filaments and can respond to Ca2+ and PPI transients independently, under conditions in which gelsolin is ineffective. The coexistence of gCap39 with gelsolin should allow precise regulation of actin assembly at the leading edge of the cell.\r"

The amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) in each oocyte or embryo was almost constant during oogenesis and was maintained until the blastula stage of embryonic development, indicating that the observed 3.2-kilobase transcript is a maternal message. The only normal adult tissue in which ets-2 mRNA was detected was the ovary. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides homologous to the ets-2 sequence into oocytes led to degradation of the mRNA and blocked hormone-induced germinal vesicle breakdown. The ets-2 product is thus required for the meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes.\r"

The fusion cDNA results from an interstitial deletion between a previously unknown locus, SIL (SCL interrupting locus), and the 5' untranslated region of SCL. Similar to 1;14 translocations, this deletion disrupts the SCL 5' regulatory region. This event is probably mediated by V-(D)-J recombinase activity, although neither locus is an immunoglobulin or a T cell receptor. Two other T cell lines, CEM and RPMI 8402, have essentially identical deletions. Thus, in lymphocytes, growth-affecting genes other than immune receptors risk rearrangements.\r"

All were motivated to stop smoking abruptly and all had smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day for at least five years. Side effects and taste acceptability were related to outcome after six months. The participants attended nine meetings over a year, at which lectures, support, and advice about stopping smoking were given. Tobacco abstinence was confirmed by measurement of carbon monoxide in expired air. The chewing gums were used for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks there was a trend towards more abstainers in the nicotine group (59%) than in the silver acetate (50%) and ordinary (45%) chewing gum groups that was not quite significant (p = 0.07). At 26 and 52 weeks the number of cigarette abstainers was similar in the three treatment groups. Subjects in the nicotine chewing gum group had a longer mean time before relapse than those in the silver acetate and ordinary chewing gum groups. Mean success rates for all subjects combined at 12, 26, and 52 weeks were 52.8%, 39.7%, and 23.3%. The side effects of nicotine and silver acetate chewing gum were generally mild and transient, and unimportant except for mouth irritation from silver acetate, which had a negative effect on outcome, and the low taste acceptability of nicotine, which had a strong negative influence on the success rate. The results suggest a short term effect on nicotine chewing gum on smoking cessation, but the abstinence rates after one year were generally disappointing.\r"

  ".W": "Technetium-99m labelled diethylenetriamine penta-acetate (99mTc-DTPA) was used to compare small solute absorption (clearance) from nasal, tracheobronchial, and bronchoalveolar airways in anaesthetised guinea pigs. 99mTc DTPA dissolved in saline was superfused through nasal and orolaryngeal catheters on to nasal and tracheobronchial airways; a small particle aerosol of nebulised 99mTc DTPA was delivered to the bronchoalveolar airways through a tracheostomy. Radioactivity over the appropriate region was then determined with a gamma camera. Mucociliary transport of 99mTc DTPA appeared not to contribute to the disappearance of 99mTc DTPA. Time-activity curves were obtained and half life values calculated by fitting a monoexponential equation to the experimental data. A progressive reduction in 99mTc DTPA was recorded from the nasal and tracheobronchial airways and from the bronchoalveolar airway, suggesting that absorption was occurring. The disappearance of 99mTc DTPA was fastest from the bronchoalveolar region, which also had the largest mucosal surface. The similar shape of the retention curves for the nasal and tracheobronchial regions suggests that the characteristics of nasal absorption of 99mTc DTPA could prove applicable to the tracheobronchial region. It is proposed that the present methods are suited for comparing the pharmacology of small solute absorption across nasal, tracheobronchial, and bronchoalveolar airway mucosa.\r"

There was no postoperative worsening of dyspnoea despite a mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of 60% predicted for the patients undergoing surgery and of 20% predicted for two patients with severe restrictive defects, perhaps owing to the fact that there was little or no function in the resected part of the lung, as shown by preoperative isotope ventilation-perfusion scanning, and that patients were under the age of 50 and generally fit. There has been no recurrence of haemoptysis during follow up, which has been from 12 to 33 months. Surgical resection, provided that cases are carefully selected, offers the best chance of cure with low mortality and morbidity.\r"

Malignant tumours were more common than benign (54 v 36) and occurred in an older population (mean ages 47 and 31 years). The scapula was the most common site for malignant lesions and the ribs the most common site for benign tumours. Chondrosarcoma was the commonest tumour in older patients, fibrous dysplasia and plasmacytoma in the middle age group, and eosinophilic granuloma in children. Presenting symptoms were a poor guide to whether the lesion was malignant or not. This and the small proportion of correct preoperative diagnoses indicate the need for early biopsy. Bone tumour registries provide a valuable source of cumulative information about uncommon tumours and facilitate accurate diagnosis, teaching, and research.\r"

  ".W": "Frusemide, an inhibitor of sodium-potassium-chloride (Na-K-Cl) cotransport, has been shown to inhibit the airway response to several constrictor stimuli in asthmatic subjects. The protection seen with frusemide in these studies could be due to an effect on epithelium, inflammatory cells, neural pathways, or airway smooth muscle. To determine whether frusemide inhibits airway smooth muscle contraction, experiments were performed in bovine and human airways in vitro. Fresh bovine tissue was obtained from the abattoir and human tissue from thoracotomy. The effect of 10(-5)M frusemide on histamine, potassium chloride, and hyperosmolar saline induced contractions was studied in bovine tracheal strips without epithelium. Frusemide, at a concentration that specifically inhibits Na-K-Cl cotransport, did not inhibit contraction caused by any of these agents. Frusemide was also without effect on hypertonic saline induced contractions of bovine and human bronchial rings with epithelium intact. These results suggest that modification of Na-K-Cl cotransport does not alter airway smooth muscle contractility and that the protective effect of frusemide on induced bronchoconstriction in vivo is unlikely to be due to a direct effect on airway smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "A cross sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma in 3067 students aged 11-17 years in an urban and a rural area of Guangzhou (Canton), China. The methods used included a self administered questionnaire, a histamine bronchial provocation test, and allergen skinprick tests. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was defined as a 20% fall in FEV1 and peak expiratory flow at a provoking dose of histamine (PD20) less than 7.8 mumol on two occasions four weeks apart. The response rate was 98.0% and 99.2% in the two areas. The prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was 4.1% and of diagnosed asthma 2.4% in the total population. There were no significant differences in prevalence between the urban and the rural area or between boys and girls. The 11-12 year group had a higher prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (7.6%) than the older groups. Of the 125 with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, 12.0% were defined as having severe or moderate (PD20 less than 0.8 mumol), 26% mild (0.9-3.2 mumol), and 62% slight bronchial hyperresponsiveness (3.3-7.8 mumol). The severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was closely related to diagnosed asthma, wheezing, and cough, though half the students with bronchial hyperresponsiveness were symptom free. The most common allergens were house dust and house dust mite in the city, and hay dust, pollen, and feathers in the rural area. The odds ratios for having respectively slight, mild or moderate, and severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness were 5.9, 21.0, and 30.4 for atopy; 1.9, 1.9, and 7.3 for early respiratory infection; and 3.1, 2.5, and 5.6 for a history of parental asthma.\r"

The sample was obtained by using every 12th patient on the practice age-sex register, replacing non-responders with corresponding age and sex matched individuals from up to two further 1 in 12 samples. The response rate was 43%; 366 patients were studied. Doubling concentrations of methacholine were given to a maximum of 32 mg/ml or until a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) occurred (provocation concentration, PC20FEV1). Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was defined arbitrarily as a PC20FEV1 of 2 mg/ml or less (or 11 mumol cumulative dose, PD20FEV1). The prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was 23%. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was not associated with age but was more prevalent in women than men (31%:13%). It was also more common in those who had ever wheezed (39%) and in those who had had an attack of rhinitis in the preceding month (45%, p less than 0.1), in atopic individuals (30%), and in smokers (32%), but it was not associated with cough or dyspnoea. There was a positive correlation between PC20FEV1 and resting FEV1 (r = 0.288) and a negative correlation between PC20FEV1 and mean daily peak flow variability (r = -0.356). Stepwise binary logistic regression analysis showed significant independent effects on PC20FEV1 for mean daily peak flow variability, gender, number of positive skin test responses, resting FEV1, and mean histamine skin weal area, but no relation with smoking or mean allergen weal area. The prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was much higher than the prevalence of diagnosed asthma in the practice in 1984 (4.9%). Analysis of case notes of 169 individuals showed that those with bronchial hyperresponsiveness had not attended the practice more frequently for respiratory complaints during the previous five years.\r"

This study proposes a simple correction for the single breath TLC (TLCsb), using inert gas phase III slope to account for the effects of uneven ventilation distribution. A model of a non-uniform lung ventilation was designed, composed of a serial dead space and two alveolar compartments arranged in parallel, whose relative ventilations were determined from the phase III plateau. Before correction TLCsb was 104-44% of TLCmb in 64 subjects (17 with diffuse interstitial disease, 42 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and five healthy subjects). The limit of acceptability for the correction (TLCcorr) was determined from the 95% confidence interval of TLCsb/TLCmb in the healthy subjects. The correction resulted in a significant increase in TLCsb (p less than 0.004). TLCcorr remained under the limit of acceptability for only 12 patients with emphysema, and all 12 showed a large improvement in the TLC estimate. The presence of poorly ventilated zones during a single breath in these patients may explain this partial correction.\r"

The particles were congregated in the walls of blood vessels and in perivascular fibrous zones, consistent with a causal role of Thorotrast in the development of lung fibrosis.

  ".W": "Calcium antagonists have been used successfully in the management of hypertension for more than a decade, but less is known about their long-term metabolic effects. To define the impact of one calcium antagonist, verapamil, on serum lipids and other metabolic parameters, we placed 45 hypertensive patients on verapamil monotherapy and followed them for 4 to 8 years. After a mean treatment period of 5.3 years, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly different from baseline, whereas the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol value increased significantly from 1.17 +/- 0.41 mmol/L at the initiation of treatment to 1.39 +/- 0.36 mmol/L at 5.3 years (p less than 0.05). Other important biochemical parameters, including serum glucose, potassium and uric acid levels were unaffected by verapamil therapy. No serious side effects or adverse cardiovascular events occurred during verapamil therapy, and there were no study dropouts. It therefore seems likely that this agent will become increasingly useful in the long-term management of essential hypertension.\r"

Interventions that interfere with calcium uptake by cells retard lesion development in experimental models of atherosclerosis, underscoring calcium's critical role in atherogenesis. A wide variety of calcium antagonists, including nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem, have been shown to protect against atherosclerosis in animal models. While these drugs are quite different from each other pharmacologically, they all block intracellular calcium influx. This common property is thus the proposed mechanism for their antiatherosclerotic effects. The effectiveness of the calcium antagonists against the development of atherosclerosis in experimental models may be relevant in the selection of antihypertensive therapy--provided that their protective effects can be demonstrated in future clinical trials as well.\r"

The content and composition of lipids in cultured cells remained unchanged for the first 10 to 12 days in culture and corresponded to the respective indices in freshly isolated cells. When added to an atherosclerotic cell culture, the calcium antagonist verapamil reduced the total intracellular cholesterol level by threefold and inhibited proliferation and collagen synthesis by cultured cells within 48 hours. Of the 12 calcium antagonists tested, verapamil and nifedipine demonstrated the greatest antiatherosclerotic activity. In contrast, nitrates had no effect on atherosclerotic parameters, while beta blockers increased atherosclerotic manifestations of cultured cells. In studies in which plasma was added to cell cultures, 2 to 4 hours after patients received oral nifedipine or verapamil, their plasma prompted antiatherosclerotic responses from cell cultures by reduced intracellular cholesterol and inhibited atherosclerotic cell proliferation. Plasma of patients who received oral propranolol, however, demonstrated atherogenic characteristics. The atherogenic properties of propranolol were inhibited by nitroglycerin and nifedipine. Use of the atherosclerotic cell model allows the examination of the atherogenic and antiatherogenic properties of various drugs, thus possibly optimizing antiatherosclerotic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of hypertension may prevent many of the complications attributable to blood pressure elevation, particularly those that are \"pressure-related,\" such as stroke. However, the atherosclerotic complications of hypertension, e.g., coronary artery disease manifested as coronary morbidity and mortality, have not been reduced significantly with antihypertensive therapy. This disappointing outcome may reflect the adverse metabolic effects of the traditional therapies, diuretics and beta blockers, and their lack of specific vasoprotective properties. Increasing attention is thus being paid to the newer antihypertensive agents, which typically have fewer adverse effects and perhaps more physiologic mechanisms of antihypertensive action. Since calcium plays a key role in the genesis of atherosclerosis, calcium antagonists may positively affect the course of vascular disease. Investigators have observed that calcium antagonists display clear antiatherosclerotic properties in experimental as well as clinical studies. In one recently published clinical study, coronary artery disease was shown to develop more slowly, with a slower progression of individual stenoses, higher regression rate and less frequent occurrence of new lesions in patients treated chronically with verapamil compared to those receiving conventional therapies. Other similar investigations are currently under way to evaluate the antiatherogenic properties of calcium antagonists, including the Frankfurt Isoptin Progression Study (FIPS), the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), the International Nifedipine Trial on Atherosclerosis Coronary Therapy (INTACT), and the large-scale Montreal Heart Institute Study. Results of these studies, which use precise end points such as myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and peripheral vascular disease, may revolutionize the treatment of hypertension by identifying therapeutic approaches that control both the pressure-related and atherosclerotic complications of the disease.\r"

Early lesions in nonhuman primates with dietary hypercholesterolemia resemble atherosclerotic lesions demonstrable in the arteries of American children with comparably elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Lesion formation depends upon calcium-regulated cellular processes such as chemotaxis, adhesion, migration, proliferation, lipid uptake and necrosis. Interventions acting on cell calcium uptake including treatment with calcium chelating agents, lanthanum trichloride, and calcium antagonists may retard atherogenesis in fat-fed animals in the absence of hypolipidemic effects. Recent controlled coronary angiographic trials in patients with coronary artery disease suggest that calcium antagonists may retard the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in humans. Large-scale long-term studies are needed to determine the utility of these agents for the treatment of coronary artery disease.\r"

Data from the Framingham Heart Study and other large-scale epidemiologic studies have identified major risk factors associated with CAD, demonstrating the adverse effects of increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Other more recent investigations, including the Lipid Research Clinics Trial and the Helsinki Heart Study, have shown that lowering total cholesterol and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly reduce the risk for CAD. Because hypertension is also a significant risk factor for CAD, the assumption has been that blood pressure reduction should offer significant benefits in terms of CAD risk. However, despite their antihypertensive efficacy, diuretics and beta blockers have failed to significantly reduce CAD morbidity or mortality. The adverse effects of these antihypertensive agents on lipid profiles, glucose metabolism and other metabolic parameters may account for their disappointing performance in reducing CAD morbidity and mortality. As a result, newer agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists that appear to be free of such adverse effects have garnered considerable attention for their potential to reduce CAD risk.\r"

Body composition was normal in preambulatory children with MMC. Beyond ages 3-4 y there was significant depletion of BCM and total body water, with maldistribution of water (increased ECW and decreased ICW) and increased percentage body fat above that expected for age and sex. These findings were more pronounced in females and in those with high lesions, and were less pronounced in those who remained ambulatory. These changes may result in metabolic and nutritional maladaption during stress. The relation of BCM, total body water depletion and increased ECW to decreasing ambulatory activity suggests that early nutritional and mobility programs warrant further study.\r"

On the contrary, transketolase activity in the liver correlated positively with concentration, and both transketolase activity and concentration were decreased in the thiamin-deficient groups. These findings suggest that transketolase in the brain may be different from that in the liver and that the alteration of the enzyme activity in the brain may be based on the conformational change of the protein molecule caused by chronic alcohol administration.\r"

However, at the latter levels, calcium citrate and calcium phosphate reduced iron absorption significantly by 49% and 62%, respectively. All calcium supplements inhibited absorption of the iron supplement when taken with food. The absorption of dietary nonheme iron was also inhibited by all three supplements. This inhibition was less pronounced from a meal of high iron availability and low calcium content (28%) than from a breakfast meal of low iron availability and high calcium content (55%).

Doses between 40 and 600 mg Ca were studied. The inhibition was clearly dose related up to 300 mg Ca. Calcium added to the dough when making the rolls reduced phytate degradation during fermentation and baking. As little as 40 mg Ca added to 80 g flour reduced phytate degradation by 50%, thus increasing the phytate content of the rolls to levels interfering with iron absorption. Calcium also had a direct dose-related inhibiting effect on iron absorption, noted by adding calcium to the rolls after they had been baked instead of to the dough. Iron absorption was reduced by 50-60% at doses of 300-600 mg Ca. Giving 165 mg Ca as milk, cheese, or calcium chloride reduced absorption by 50-60%. The same amount of calcium also significantly reduced heme-iron absorption, suggesting that the effect of calcium is related to the mucosal transfer of iron. The observed marked inhibitory effect on iron absorption of calcium in amounts frequently encountered in normal meals has important nutritional implications.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the influence of coingestion of fat and protein in a mixed meal on carbohydrate metabolism, subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) received three different breakfasts varying in the amount of fat and protein (group 1) or only in the amount of fat (group 2). Compared with the changes after a standard breakfast, insulin increased after the protein-rich meal and decreased after the fat-rich meal in group 1. Glucose and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) remained constant. In contrast, only GIP showed a significant increase after a high-fat meal in group 2. Thus, in NIDDM subjects, glucose and insulin responses to different mixed meals do not appear to be exclusively mediated by GIP. Protein was confirmed as a potent stimulator of insulin secretion. Other factors, such as an altered beta-cell response in diabetics to GIP or other incretions, must be considered to explain the reported results.\r"

In this study resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) were measured in 15 outpatients with inflammatory bowel diseases and in eight healthy control subjects. Measured RMR as a percentage of that predicted from fat-free mass was not significantly different for control subjects (102 +/- 9.8%, mean +/- SD) and patients (100 +/- 13.3%). TDEE, expressed as a multiple of RMR, was 1.70 +/- 0.31 for control subjects and 1.78 +/- 0.24 for patients. When patients were subgrouped as greater than or equal to 90% or less than 90% desirable body weight, a mean increase over RMR predicted from fat-free mass was seen in the underweight patients (106 +/- 9.3%) but not in normal-weight patients (99.0 +/- 15.6%). Mean TDEE/RMR values for the patient subgroups were 1.70 +/- 0.30 and 1.88 +/- 0.08, respectively. We conclude that stable outpatients with inflammatory bowel disease have only a minimal increase in energy needs.\r"

Diet was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Hormones assayed were estrone, estradiol, percent free estradiol, sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), cortisol, and gonadotropins. Alcohol intake was not associated with concentrations of estrogens or gonadotropins. Neither total fat intake nor the fat composition of the diet influenced hormone concentrations. Fiber intake was positively correlated with SHBG; no associations with estrogens were seen. Caffeine intake was inversely correlated with free estradiol and positively correlated with SHBG. These data suggest that fat, fiber, and alcohol intakes of US women at climacteric are not determinants of variations in estrone and either total or percent free estradiol.\r"

Ten upper-body-obese (UB Ob), 10 lower-body-obese (LB Ob), and 10 nonobese (Non Ob) women were studied in an overnight postabsorptive condition (basal) and again during an infusion of low physiologic amounts of insulin (insulin clamp). Results showed that basal leucine carbon flux was greater (P less than 0.05) in UB Ob and LB Ob women than in Non Ob women (2.96 +/- 0.08 vs 3.14 +/- 0.16 vs 2.68 +/- 0.08 mumol.kg lean body mass-1.min-1, respectively; mean +/- SEM). Leucine carbon flux was not suppressed during the insulin-clamp study in UB Ob women but was in the LB Ob and Non Ob women. We conclude that moderate obesity is associated with increased proteolysis and that insulin's antiproteolytic actions are impaired in upper-body obesity. These findings could have implications for future studies of and treatment of obesity.\r"

We measured the RMR of 29 healthy, nonsmoking men aged 18-33 y by direct oxygen consumption with a closed-circuit technique similar to that used by Harris and Benedict (respirometer), as well as by a ventilated-hood technique. RMR determined by the ventilated-hood technique was 5.6% lower than when determined by the respirometer (1643 +/- 148 vs 1721 +/- 145 kcal/d, respectively, means +/- SD; P less than 0.001). RMRs by both these methods were lower than the value of 1813 +/- 164 kcal/d predicted by the HB equation; the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for RMR were 92.4-98.1% (respirometer) and 88.5-91.1% (ventilated hood) of the value predicted by the HB equation. The 95% CI for RMR determined by ventilated hood was 98.4-103.5% of the value predicted by using a new equation proposed by Owen et al. We conclude that the HB equation overestimates RMR by 9.2% in normal young men. This could be due in part to the inherent discomfort experienced by subjects when the original technique was used.\r"

Food intake during the exercise period was compared with that during the control period. Caloric intake during the control period was 2467 +/- 165 kcal/d (means +/- SEM) for men and 1831 +/- 103 kcal/d for women. During the exercise period the men increased their caloric intake to 2658 +/- 188 kcal/d and the women's caloric intake remained unchanged, 1830 +/- 91 kcal/d. Caloric intake was not affected by sequence of treatment or duration of protocol. Men responded to 5 d of acute exercise with increased caloric intake (208 +/- 64 kcal/d), which was insufficient to compensate for the caloric cost of exercise (596 kcal/d above resting metabolic rate). Women did not change their caloric intake despite expending 382 kcals/d during exercise. Consequently, both normal-weight men and women were in negative caloric balance during the exercise period.\r"

In both urban and rural mothers, as lactation progressed LF decreased by 33% and 55% whereas sIgA remained unchanged and LZ steadily increased. There was more LZ and sIgA in rural milk, contrasting with the poorer maternal nutrition. As calculated from individual milk yields, the urban infants were fed daily with twice as much LF and sIgA but with similar amounts of LZ as were the rural infants. In the early stage of lactation, the milk of both groups of Zairean mothers contains more sIgA than that of a group of west European (Belgian) mothers (n = 20), but the LF and LZ contents were rather similar.\r"

At both dose levels of trestatin (3 and 6 mg/75 g starch) the peak values of plasma glucose and insulin were reduced markedly (compared with placebo) after the ingestion of 75 g starch in the form of bread. In healthy control subjects as well as in diabetic patients, trestatin produced significantly lower insulin excretions but also significant reductions in incremental plasma glucose areas in a dose-dependent fashion. It is concluded that it is technologically feasible to incorporate trestatin into starchy foods without loss of activity or impairment of taste. Furthermore, the positive effect of trestatin on glycemic and insulinemic responses in diabetics and the lack of serious side effects offer a great potential in the dietary treatment of diabetic patients.\r"

Equation 2 does not include the RV and has an r of 0.82 and an SEE of 4.3%. Both equations were more precise than two previous widely used equations. In a subgroup of 37 subjects who underwent weight loss, equation 1 gave a more precise estimate of the change in PBF.

Changes in PLP were not related to plasma volume or blood glucose, free fatty acids, lactate, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, or alanine aminotransferase. No significant changes in plasma PL were noted. Exercise induces an increase in plasma PLP, perhaps due to transfer of B-6 vitamers from liver to skeletal muscle.\r"

The increase in the percentage of cells with markers of NK cells and in expression of IL-2 receptors was dose dependent. The plasma concentrations of beta-carotene were also elevated significantly; however, there was no increase in the amount of retinol present in plasma. This indicated that immunomodulation induced by beta-carotene may be due to the carotenoid rather than to an increased amount, and hence actions, of vitamin A. These results support the role of immunostimulation as a potential mechanism of action of beta-carotene with cancer-prevention potential.\r"

The concentrations of alpha-tocopherol in CSF correlated significantly (P less than 0.001) with both total protein and albumin concentrations, suggesting that tocopherol transport into CSF is linked with that of plasma proteins. In vitro oxidation of vitamin E in CSF by the free-radical generator 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride showed a measurable induction (lag) period. This is due to the presence of other antioxidants in human CSF.\r"

Thirteen fetuses died and six survived. Of all parameters examined, including associated anomalies, abnormal karyotype, location of serous fluid, anemia, and possible cause of nonimmune hydrops fetalis, the most sensitive prognostic indicator was the real-time-directed M-mode echocardiographic measurement of the biventricular outer dimension in diastole. All fetuses with biventricular outer dimensions greater than 95% died, whereas all but one with normal biventricular outer dimensions had resolution of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and survived. This was highly significant (p less than 0.001) with the predictive value of a normal biventricular outer dimension being 86% and the predictive value of an enlarged biventricular outer dimension being 100%.\r"

In this prospective study of 40 uncomplicated term pregnancies, we sought to define the relationship of umbilical cord length and cord blood hematocrit level (as an index of viscosity) to the umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio. To focus on these factors, we minimized known sources of systolic/diastolic ratio variability and controlled for fetal heart rate. Linear regression revealed that fetal heart rate contributed 18% of the systolic/diastolic ratio variability. Conversely, umbilical cord length and cord blood hematocrit level were not related to umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio. We conclude that normal variations in cord blood hematocrit level and umbilical cord length do not significantly affect systolic/diastolic ratio.\r"

Heart rate, systolic and diastolic velocities were measured from the umbilical artery waveform. Diastolic velocity varied the most with a mean (+/- SD) coefficient of variation of 16.0% +/- 5.0%. The coefficient of variation of systolic velocity was 7.8% +/- 2.4% and of heart rate was 5.0% +/- 1.8%. We also found that umbilical arterial flow was related to umbilical venous flow, implying an interdependence between fetal cardiovascular blood flow and placental blood flow. During breathing, venous flow varies because of changes in intrathoracic pressure in the fetus. This variation in umbilical venous velocity may affect the umbilical arterial diastolic velocity through alterations in placental filling, and may affect the umbilical arterial systolic velocity through alterations in ventricular filling, which by the Frank-Starling mechanism changes stroke volume. The interdependency of umbilical venous and umbilical arterial blood flow velocities must be considered in the interpretation of the significance of umbilical artery Doppler velocity measurements.\r"

We determined the concentration of chorionic gonadotropin in frozen serum samples from women of known maternal age and weight, fetal biparietal diameter, and femur length, and alpha-fetoprotein concentration. When corrected for gestational age and maternal weight, the potential predictors were independent, except for a slight correlation (r = 0.10) between maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin. Both maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin and biparietal diameter/femur length demonstrated an approximately log-normal distribution similar to maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. Therefore it is scientifically sound to use any or all of these variables in combination for the identification of pregnancies at increased risk for Down syndrome.\r"

The onset, course, and outcome of labor were independently monitored in 131 well-conditioned recreational athletes who had an uneventful first half of pregnancy. Daily exercise performance was quantitated before conception and throughout pregnancy. Comparisons were made between the 87 women who continued to exercise regularly at or above 50% of their preconceptional level throughout pregnancy and the 44 who discontinued their regular exercise regimen before the end of the first trimester. The incidence of preterm labor was similar in the two groups (9%). Labor began significantly earlier in the exercise group (277 +/- 6 vs 282 +/- 6 days). The women who continued to exercise had a lower incidence of abdominal (6% vs 30%) and vaginal (6% vs 20%) operative delivery, and active labor was shorter (264 +/- 149 vs 382 +/- 275 min) in those who were delivered vaginally. Finally, clinical evidence of acute fetal stress (meconium, fetal heart pattern, and Apgar score) was less frequent in the exercise group (50% vs 26%), although birth weight was reduced (3369 +/- 318 vs 3776 +/- 401 gm). These data negate the initial hypothesis and indicate that, in well-conditioned women who regularly perform aerobics or run, continuation of these exercise regimens has a beneficial effect on the course and outcome of labor.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that continuation of a regular running and/or aerobics program during late pregnancy at or above 50% of preconceptional levels limits fetal growth. Accordingly, detailed neonatal morphometric data were gathered in the offspring of two groups: 77 well-conditioned recreational runners and aerobic dancers who were delivered at term after continuing their exercise regimen at or above 50% of the preconceptional level throughout pregnancy and 55 matched controls. Daily exercise performance was quantitated before conception and throughout pregnancy. Significant reductions in birth weight (-310 gm), birth weight percentile (-20), ponderal index (-0.24), its percentile (-30), and the fetoplacental weight ratio (-0.7) were seen in the offspring of the exercise group whereas crown-heel length (51.4 cm) and head circumference (35.0) were similar in the two groups. Reductions in two-site skin-fold thickness (-1.5 mm), skin-fold percentile (-30), calculated percent body fat (-5.0%), and fat mass (-220 gm) in the offspring of the exercise group confirmed the asymmetric pattern of growth restriction and indicated that approximately 70% of the difference in birth weight could be explained by the difference in neonatal fat mass. In runners, the relative level of exercise performance in the last 5 months of pregnancy explained 40% of the variability in birth weight over an 1100 gm birth weight range. We conclude that continuation of a regular aerobic or running program at or above a minimal training level during late pregnancy results in an asymmetric pattern of growth restriction that primarily impacts on neonatal fat mass.\r"

An interval of less than 3 hours after the last meal was found to be associated with a significantly greater insulin response as opposed to a fasting interval of more than 3 hours (121.3 pmol/l vs. 83.5 pmol/l, p less than .001) and a greater insulin/glucose index (0.92 vs. 0.66, p less than .001), with no difference in plasma glucose.

One hundred eighteen women had normal screening results (glucose level less than 140 mg/dl) and 35 had abnormal screening values but a normal oral glucose tolerance test. Abnormal responders had greater insulin levels (149 vs 82 pmol/L, p less than 0.0001), and a higher insulin/glucose index (0.96 vs. 0.72, p less than 0.007). Patients with glucose levels less than 100 mg/dl had significantly lower insulin/glucose indices. Overall, obese patients had significantly greater glucose and insulin measurements than did nonobese women, but there was no difference within normal and abnormal groups. Glucose levels accounted for 52% of the insulin output and 29% of the insulin/glucose index variance. Neither age, parity, nor obesity contributed significantly to insulin levels in the multiple regression model. Therefore the accepted threshold for glucose screening reflects abnormal insulin output and this aberration may be indicative of the primary defect in gestational diabetes.\r"

A cohort of similar women requesting a non-oral-contraceptive method served as controls. The two oral contraceptives studied were ethinyl estradiol (0.035 mg)-norethindrone (0.40 mg) and ethinyl estradiol (0.030 to 0.040 mg)-levonorgestrel (0.050 to 0.125 mg). A 75 gm, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test and a fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglyceride, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols) were performed at entry, after 3 months, and after 6 to 13 months of treatment. The prevalence of diabetes at 6 to 13 months (27/156 patients) was not significantly different between groups (non-oral-contraceptive group, 17%; ethinyl estradiol-norethindrone, 15%; ethinyl estradiol-levonorgestrel, 20%). When examined by prior gestational diabetes mellitus class, diabetes mellitus was present in 7% of prior class A1 and 29% of women with prior class A2 disease (p less than 0.001). Mean cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly improved in all three groups at 3 months and at 6 to 13 months, whereas triglycerides remained unchanged. There were no differences in cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides levels between the groups. After 6 to 13 months, there was a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the ethinyl estradiol-norethindrone group compared with the ethinyl estradiol-levonorgestrel and non-oral-contraceptive groups.\r"

Placental vascular resistance remained constant during 25-minute perfusion periods with 80 mg/dl followed by 160 mg/dl glucose solution. Subsequent perfusion with 320 mg/dl glucose produced a significant increase in placental vascular resistance. Placentas were also studied in which the placental cotyledon was sequentially perfused for 25-minute periods with solutions containing glucose at 80 mg/dl followed immediately by 320 mg/dl (n = 5). Placental vascular resistance remained constant throughout perfusion with 80 mg/dl glucose solution but increased significantly after beginning perfusion with 320 mg/dl glucose. We conclude that the increase in placental vascular resistance appears to be a function of the high glucose level rather than the duration of glucose perfusion.\r"

With a tissue incubation technique, we examined the placental production of thromboxane and prostacyclin in cotyledons from seven normal near-term ewes (127 +/- 3 days' gestation) and six streptozocin-induced diabetic ewes (125 +/- 3 days' gestation). Diabetic status was verified with serial fasting blood glucose assessments. Placental tissue was incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 hours at 37 degrees C with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide. Samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 32, and 48 hours. Radioimmunoassay of the stable metabolites thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were used to determine thromboxane and prostacyclin production, respectively. Placental thromboxane production was reduced in diabetic animals when compared with control animals (5.63 +/- 2.81 vs 7.32 +/- 1.37 pg/mg per hour, respectively; p less than 0.05). Prostacyclin production was also significantly reduced in the diabetic placentas compared with control placentas (11.44 +/- 4.06 vs 16.29 +/- 4.59 pg/mg per hour, respectively; p less than 0.05). We conclude that the ovine placenta produces thromboxane and prostacyclin. The ovine thromboxane production rate is comparable to that of the human placenta but the prostacyclin production rate is approximately two to three times higher. The observed decrease in the placental production of thromboxane and prostacyclin may reflect an adverse effect of hyperglycemia directly on eicosanoid production or indirectly through decreased placental cellular proliferation.\r"

Our current studies demonstrate that a pregnancy growth factor activity is elevated compared with postpartum values in the blood of women with preeclampsia months before the onset of clinical manifestations of toxemia. A cohort of primigravid women was followed throughout pregnancy and multiple serial plasma samples from six women with preeclampsia and six matched normal women were assayed for mitogenic activity. The data indicated that the ratio of predelivery/postdelivery plasma mitogenic activity was greater in women predestined to meet strict criteria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia compared with matched normal primigravid women. Growth factor activity could distinguish women in whom preeclampsia would develop from their normal peers throughout pregnancy, and as early as the first trimester of gestation (p less than 0.05). Similar studies performed with plasma obtained greater than 6 weeks post partum, when the two groups of patients were clinically indistinguishable, revealed no differences in this index of mitogenic activity. Our results indicate that elevated mitogenic activity ratios of prepartum versus postpartum plasma antedate the clinical recognition of preeclampsia, and return to normal with the resolution of the syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty patients with preeclampsia at a gestational age of 26 to 35 weeks were treated with oral nifedipine until delivery. The mean oral daily dose was 45.1 +/- 11 mg/day (range, 40 to 80 mg/day). Fetal aorta, internal carotid artery, umbilical artery, and uteroplacental Doppler flow velocity waveforms were recorded before treatment and then serially. The mean nifedipine concentration at the time of the Doppler studies was 60.3 ng/ml (range, 10 to 90 ng/ml). The use of nifedipine therapy was associated with a significant decrease in both maternal systolic blood pressure (baseline, 154 to 135 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (baseline, 100 to 88 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the resistance index between baseline and postnifedipine Doppler studies in either the fetal or uteroplacental vessels. The use of oral nifedipine to control blood pressure in preeclampsia does not affect the resistance indices in fetal or uteroplacental vessels as measured by the Doppler technique.\r"

Visual symptoms were common during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. Blurred vision was present in 12 of 13 patients and diplopia was present in 10 of 13 patients. Abnormal findings during neuroophthalmologic examination occurred in all patients during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. Findings included ptosis, accommodative and convergence insufficiency, and abnormal pupillary responsiveness to light and near. All patients were symptom-free and had normal examinations after magnesium sulfate was discontinued. These findings suggest that visual disturbances with therapeutic magnesium sulfate are common.\r"

  ".W": "Forty pregnant women (28 to 32 weeks' gestation) were given low-dose aspirin therapy (81 mg/day) from the time of enrollment until delivery; circulating eicosanoid levels and angiotensin II pressor responses were measured before and after 1 week of aspirin therapy. Subsequent clinical outcome was correlated with these results. All women had significant reductions in serum and plasma thromboxane B2 levels with aspirin treatment (p less than 0.01). Eleven women who remained sensitive to the pressor effects of angiotensin II (effective pressor dose less than 10 ng/kg/min) after 1 week of low-dose aspirin treatment exhibited significant decreases (p less than 0.05) in plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (264 +/- 119 vs 161 +/- 31 pg/ml, mean +/- SD) and prostaglandin E2 (476 +/- 174 vs 351 +/- 112 pg/ml) levels. In contrast, patients who were either nonsensitive (refractory) to angiotensin II (n = 18; greater than or equal to 10 ng/kg/min) before aspirin or became nonsensitive after aspirin administration (n = 11) had no change in either plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha or prostaglandin E2 concentrations. The occurrence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 100% in the women who remained angiotensin II sensitive during aspirin therapy as compared with 36% and 39% in the other two groups (x2 = 16.14; p less than 0.001). Thus during low-dose aspirin therapy a failure to develop refractoriness to infused angiotensin II is associated with a nonselective inhibition of eicosanoids and the almost certain development of pregnancy-induced hypertension. These observations may reflect a basic defect in vascular adaptation to pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "The chronic effects of captopril on maternal hemodynamics and organ perfusion were investigated in 10 untreated and 10 captopril-treated pregnant spontaneously hypertensive rats by means of the radioactive-labeled microsphere technique. The normal decrease in blood pressure during gestation was prevented by reduction of litter size to two conceptuses on day 7 of gestation. Captopril (approximately 10 mg/kg/day) or drug vehicle (50% ethyl alcohol) was administered intraperitoneally by an osmotic pump from day 7 to 21. At term mean arterial pressure was 23% lower in the captopril-treated group as the result of a 29% decrease in total peripheral resistance without a significant change in cardiac output. The decrease in total peripheral resistance was primarily caused by a decline in splanchnic and skin resistances. Maternal organ and uteroplacental perfusion were not significantly altered. We conclude that administration of captopril during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy in the hypertensive rat effectively lowers maternal blood pressure without adverse effects on organ and uteroplacental perfusion.\r"

Maternal characteristics, gestational age at induction, induction-delivery interval, analgesia for labor, cesarean section rates, and newborn characteristics were similar in both groups. The mean +/- SEM total oxytocin administered was significantly less in the pulsed group (3564 +/- 487 mU) than in the continuous group (7684 +/- 844 mU; p less than 0.0001); the average dose of oxytocin administered per minute was significantly lower in the pulsed group (3.9 +/- 0.3 mU/min) than in the continuous group (7.8 +/- 0.4 mU/min; p less than 0.0001); the peak or highest administered dose of oxytocin expressed per minute was also signficantly lower in the pulsed group (9.6 +/- 0.8 mU/min) than in the continuous group (14.1 +/- 0.7 mU/min; p less than 0.0001). These significant differences persisted even when controlled for parity, Bishop's score of the cervix, and number of days induction of labor was carried out. Uterine hyperstimulation occurred infrequently in both groups (3.6% to 4.0%). The pulsed group required a significantly smaller infusion volume (25 +/- 14 ml) than the continuous group (780 +/- 84 ml; p less than 0.0001). Thus pulsatile administration uses significantly less oxytocin and infusion fluid but is as effective and safe as continuous infusion.\r"

Three types of uterine contractions were studied: immediately after operation, during the nocturnal period, and near or at labor. Bolus intravenous injections of oxytocin antagonist were given and uterine activity was examined +/- 1 hour after the injection. The oxytocin antagonist caused a precipitate decrease (approximately 70%) in contractile force (mean amplitude x frequency) in the first 15 minutes after injection (p less than 0.05); this force diminished to approximately 90% at the end of 1 hour for both nocturnal and labor contractions. In contrast, uterine contractions immediately after operation were diminished by only 60% within 60 minutes after the oxytocin antagonist. These results indicate that the oxytocin antagonist is a potent inhibitor and suggest that oxytocin is a primary regulator of spontaneous nocturnal and labor uterine contractions in the pregnant baboon.\r"

  ".W": "Human amnion cells synthesize and release prostaglandin E2 in response to epidermal growth factor. The protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate also stimulates amnion cell prostaglandin E2 synthesis. We used a human amnion cell line (WISH) to conduct in vitro experiments to investigate a potential role of protein kinase C in the signal transduction pathway leading to epidermal growth factor-induced prostaglandin E2 production. Pretreatment of cultured amnion cells with a low, nonstimulating dose of phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate potentiated the action of epidermal growth factor in causing prostaglandin E2 production as measured by radioimmunoassay. The protein kinase C-selective inhibitor staurosporine inhibited epidermal growth factor-induced prostaglandin E2 production, further suggesting a role for protein kinase C in epidermal growth factor action. Experiments were conducted in which amnion cells were rendered protein kinase C-deficient by chronic exposure to phorbol ester, which has been shown to down-regulate the enzyme. In these cells, epidermal growth factor caused prostaglandin E2 synthesis at levels comparable to native (non-protein kinase C-deficient) cells. We conclude that protein kinase C plays a more modulatory than direct role in the epidermal growth factor signal transduction cascade that leads to prostaglandin E2 production by amnion cells. We propose a bifurcating transduction scheme in which, under conditions of protein kinase C inactivation, epidermal growth factor alone causes prostaglandin E2 synthesis. When protein kinase C is activated by as yet unknown endogenous substances, the epidermal growth factor responsiveness of the amnion cells is greatly enhanced. This pathway could have important implications in a feed-forward mechanism regulating the level of prostaglandin E2 production during the onset of labor.\r"

  ".W": "Although the fetus is considered to be an \"allograft\" there is little information concerning the role of lymphokines in human pregnancy. Lymphokines are polypeptides secreted by stimulated lymphocytes that direct the immune response by enabling immune effector cells to communicate with each other. To characterize lymphokine production during normal human pregnancy, we isolated peripheral leukocytes and decidual lymphocyte-like cells from women undergoing repeat cesarean section at term. After stimulation with mitogen and paternal antigen for 24 hours, culture supernatants were assayed for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was no difference in the amount of interleukin-2 produced by stimulated peripheral and decidual cells. However, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production by stimulated decidual lymphocyte-like cells was significantly greater than granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor produced by peripheral lymphocytes. Decidual lymphocyte-like cells produced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor both spontaneously and after stimulation with mitogen or paternal antigen, whereas peripheral leukocytes did not. This suggests that the decidua constitutes a distinct immunologic microenvironment.\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen pregnant women who subsequently were delivered of infants with birth weights less than the 3rd percentile were studied for examination of fetal heart rate and fetal activity patients during maternal administration of oxygen at a concentration of 50% or room air for 2 hours. None of the fetuses was acidotic at birth. Maternal transcutaneous PO2 levels increased from 79 +/- 3 mm Hg to 158 +/- 10 mm Hg for the 2 hours of observation. The results indicated that maternal hyperoxia produced sustained fetal breathing activity that was almost 100% higher than that in room air (analysis of variance, p = 0.024). Gross fetal body movements, fetal heart rate accelerations, and fetal heart rate variability increased significantly with increasing observation time (analysis of variance, p less than 0.01), but were not significantly altered by maternal hyperoxia or room air. We conclude that despite significant change in fetal breathing activity, ultrasonographic observation of fetal behavioral activity during maternal hyperoxia could not be used to differentiate severely growth-retarded from normally grown human fetuses. We speculate that altered fetal heart rate and fetal body movement patterns usually associated with intrauterine growth retardation might be related to altered development of the fetal central nervous system and are not reversible during prolonged maternal administration of oxygen.\r"

We sought to determine whether reduced fetal urine production might be associated with oligohydramnios in pregnancies that reach 42 weeks or more. Ultrasonographic measurements of the fetal bladder were obtained every 2 to 5 minutes for 1 hour in 38 gestations verified to be at least 42 weeks. Oligohydramnios was present in eight of the prolonged pregnancies. Similar measurements were performed in 15 normal pregnancies delivered by elective repeat cesarean section between 38 and 40 weeks' gestation. Hourly fetal urine production rates were calculated with sequential bladder volume measurements. The result of this investigation suggest that diminished fetal urine production is associated with oligohydramnios in prolonged pregnancy. The mechanism by which fetal urine production is reduced in prolonged pregnancy remains unknown. A likely possibility is reduced fetal swallowing because of already diminished amnionic fluid volume, the latter a result of placental senescence.\r"

  ".W": "Our aim was to determine the mechanism whereby oligohydroamnios causes reduced fetal lung expansion and eventual lung hypoplasia. We studied 20 fetal sheep during 2 to 9 days of oligohydramnios produced by drainage of amniotic and allantoic fluids during the last third of gestation. Oligohydramnios led to a reversible reduction in lung liquid volume of 19.5% within 48 hours. During oligohydramnios tracheal pressure, relative to amniotic pressure, rose by 1.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); pressures also tended to rise in the fetal pleural space and abdomen, relative to amniotic pressure, and to fall in the amniotic sac. Pressure increments, relative to amniotic pressure, which normally occur in the fetal trachea, pleural cavity, and abdomen during nonlabor uterine contractions, were significantly increased by 1.9 to 2.5 mm Hg during oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios increased flexion of the fetal thoracolumbar spine, quantified as a reduction in the ratio of spinal radius of curvature to spine length (0.76 in controls vs 0.40 after oligohydramnios, p less than 0.001). In three sets of twins, only the fetus exposed to oligohydramnios was affected. A similar degree of spinal flexion imposed on normal fetal sheep cadavers increased abdominal (1.6 mm Hg), pleural (1.5 mm Hg), and tracheal (2.0 mm Hg) pressure, and caused a significant reduction in fetal lung expansion. We conclude that oligohydramnios in fetal sheep increases spinal flexion, leading to compression of abdominal contents, upward displacement of the diaphragm, and lung compression, favoring loss of fetal lung liquid. These changes, which are accentuated during nonlabor uterine contractions and are reversible, may lead to pulmonary hypoplasia if prolonged.\r"

These discordant observations have been attributed to methodologic differences among laboratories, but may instead relate to inadvertant cellular contamination during long-term culture. Retrieval of chorionic villi for genetic analysis has provided an opportunity to evaluate the immunoregulatory activity of the isolated villus preparation, unencumbered by extended culture techniques. Primary cytotrophoblast cultures were established from karyotypically and clinically normal pregnancies and the supernatants were recovered. Allogenic mononuclear cells, stimulated by phytohemagglutinin, were uniformly inhibited by trophoblast supernatant (mean inhibition, 34.3%). This inhibition was verified in one-way, mixed lymphocyte cultures and suppression of T cells occurred in a dose-dependent fashion over a range of trophoblast supernatant concentrations. No evidence of suppressor T-cell induction by trophoblast supernatant was noted with the use of both phenotypic studies of lymphocytes incubated with trophoblast supernatant and a functional suppressor T-cell inducer assay. We believe that the immunoregulatory properties of trophoblast supernatants identified with the use of these methods more closely approximate the paracrine function of the in situ villus.\r"

The embryonic skin, the periderm, expressed CA 125 antigen and its adult derivatives, the mammary glands and apocrine sweat glands, expressed CA 125 while in the active state of secretion. In a 6-week-old formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded ectopic embryo specimen, antibodies M 2 and M 11 recognized CA 125 in the periderm, the notochord, the myocardium, the pericardium, the gastroenteric tract, enteric duct remnants in the umbilical cord (vitelline and allantoic ducts), the mesonephric duct, and the amnion. OC 125 staining of these formalin-fixed specimens was either very faint or absent. In a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimen of apocrine sweat glands from the axilla, antibodies M 2 and M 11 detected CA 125 antigen intracellularly in the secretory cells.

Modifications of the culture system provided an increase in stromal cell yield, thus permitting multiple comparisons from the treatment of cells from a common endometrial sample. The effects of high-dose estradiol also were evaluated in this system. The findings suggest relative potencies of 50:1 for medroxyprogesterone acetate and progesterone. Norethindrone gave intermediate and more variable responses. Estradiol potentiated prolactin production from only submaximal progestins doses. The differences between the progestin effects, in large measure, were due to differential culture growth as reflected by culture mass. Compared to controls and estradiol alone, all the progestins induced much greater prolactin production. Thus during decidualization, progestins probably promote both stromal growth and intracellular prolactin production. High-dose estradiol may not interfere with these events.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial infection has been implicated in premature labor in humans. To elucidate mechanisms and potential intervention strategies, we sought to develop a model of infection-induced pregnancy loss in rabbits. On day 21 (70% of gestation), each uterine horn was inoculated hysteroscopically with 0.2 ml containing saline solution of 10(6) cfu Escherichia coli or Bacteroides bivius or Fusobacterium necrophorum. Fetal viability was assessed. Animals were sacrificed at various times or as delivery occurred. Serum progesterone and amniotic fluid prostaglandins were measured. Cultures and histologic sections were prepared. Compared with the saline solution group, E coli and F. necrophorum-inoculated rabbits were significantly more likely to deliver (16 of 16 and six of seven with mean times of 31.9 +/- 10.7 and 28.3 +/- 11.5 hours, respectively for E. coli and F. necrophorum). Positive amniotic fluid cultures for the E. coli group were found in 11 of 12 (92%) and for the F. necrophorum group in three of three cases (100%). Histologic inflammation was seen heavily in both the E. coli and F. necrophorum groups, whereas it was absent in the saline solution group. Inoculation with B. bivius led to a much lower pregnancy loss rate (eight of 32) and less histologic inflammation despite positive uterine cultures in most animals. This model may provide an opportunity to determine mechanisms of clinical or subclinical intraamniotic infection and to test intervention strategies.\r"

We compared in vitro inhibition of esterase activity in amniotic fluid with bacterial cultures to identify the origins of the specific esterases released by the infecting organisms. One hundred forty-one samples were tested (90 uninfected, 51 infected). Each sample was evaluated for Gram stain, cultures, and an in vitro esterase assay followed by ebelactone inhibition. Forty-two patients had positive amniotic fluid cultures. Ebelactone produced varying degrees of inhibition of esterase activity (range, 20% to 60%) in the uninfected samples and in those infected with gram-negative organisms. There was no inhibition in the samples infected with gram-positive organisms. Thus different groups of bacteria may elicit the production of different and specific esterases in infected amniotic fluid, as shown by the differences in in vitro inhibition.\r"

The findings suggest that smoking affects the levels and distribution of ascorbic acid. In smokers (n = 16), the number of exfoliated cervicovaginal epithelial cells and leukocyte ascorbic acid levels was significantly higher (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively) compared with nonsmokers (n = 30). In addition, cervicovaginal cell ascorbic acid, plasma reduced and total ascorbic acid levels were significantly lower (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). The exfoliated epithelial cell ascorbic acid levels in nonsmokers was fourfold greater than that of leukocytes.

  ".W": "Because smoking is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis, yet a decreased risk of endometrial carcinoma, a state of relative hypoestrogenism induced by smoking has been suggested. However, because previous data are unclear and do not reflect current trends in smoking intensity and estrogen prescriptions, we examined the estrogen profiles of postmenopausal women, by smoking status, both before and after oral micronized estradiol. Baseline levels of estrone, estradiol, estrone sulfate, and estrone glucuronide were similar in nonsmokers and smokers, but unbound (non-sex-hormone-binding-globulin--bound) estradiol was significantly lower in smoking women (p less than 0.05) and sex-hormone-binding-globulin--binding capacity was higher (p less than 0.001). After 1 or 2 mg of micronized estradiol, estrone and estradiol serum profiles were similar but unbound estradiol was significantly lower in women who were smokers (p less than 0.05). Serum estrone glucuronide rose with treatment but was indistinguishable in nonsmokers and smokers. However, maximum changes in serum estrone sulfate were greater in smokers after administration of estrogen, suggesting a hepatic effect. Urinary estrone glucuronide levels increased after 8 hours of oral estrogen but were similar in nonsmokers and smokers with the two doses. It appears that even moderate smoking, as studied here, induces significant changes in hepatic estrogen metabolism and is best reflected by alterations in serum estrone sulfate and sex-hormone-binding-globulin--binding capacity that result in decreased serum unbound estradiol. However, these changes do not appear to require increasing the estrogen dosage to achieve physiologic levels of estrogen in postmenopausal smokers.\r"

  ".W": "Human ovarian tissue and bovine ovarian stroma and follicles bound tritiated oxytocin and tritiated arginine vasopressin with similar affinity, whereas bovine corpora lutea bound tritiated oxytocin only. Competition for the binding of tritiated oxytocin by various agonists and antagonists was suggestive of receptor function. The number of oxytocin binding sites varied cyclically in all tissues. In bovine ovarian stroma and corpora lutea the concentrations were lowest on day 14 and highest on days 17, 19, and 21 after ovulation, with a striking peak in the luteal concentration on day 19. In human ovarian tissues the concentrations also were highest in samples obtained in late luteal phase. In large follicles the concentration of oxytocin binding sites was highest on the day of estrus and lowest on day 7. In bovine ovary the number of arginine vasopressin binding sites was approximately 50% lower than oxytocin binding sites and the cyclic variations were not significant. Human ovarian tissue had similar numbers of oxytocin and arginine vasopressin binding sites. Because bovine ovaries produce oxytocin and arginine vasopressin the results suggest a paracrine or autocrine role for these neuropeptides in luteolysis and ovulation. Although their synthesis in human ovaries is still controversial the presence of binding sites suggests a physiologic role in the regulation of human ovarian function as well.\r"

The Y-specific probes Y97 mapped to Y centromere, pDP105 A,B mapped to Yp and distal Yq11, respectively, hybridized with the deoxyribonucleic acid from all the 13 study subjects. The same deoxyribonucleic acid samples were analyzed for the presence of the zinc finger Y sequence. Eleven of the 13 subjects were positive for the zinc finger Y sequence. Four zinc finger Y-positive subjects had unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral (n = 2) testicular differentiation. Among the nine subjects with bilateral streak gonads, seven showed the presence of this sequence. The lack of testicular differentiation in the presence of quantitatively normal or almost normal zinc finger Y bands could not be explained by mosaicism alone. Mutations not detectable by analysis with the method of Southern with pDP1007, may occur in the testicular determinant factor gene vitiating testicular development.\r"

We isolated and sequenced a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid clone for 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase from the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line. Comparison of the BeWo complementary deoxyribonucleic acid sequence to a previously derived placental complementary deoxyribonucleic acid sequence yields greater than 98% homology. We also isolated the gene for 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase from the Jar human choriocarcinoma cell line and elucidated its primary nucleic acid structure. Significant differences in the Jar-deduced complementary deoxyribonucleic acid sequence clearly differentiate it from both the human placental and BeWo forms of 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase, indicating the existence of two genes for 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase in the human genome. Evaluation of 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase gene expression in BeWo and Jar cells was compared with expression in luteinized granulosa cells. Messenger ribonucleic acid for human placental 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase was identified in all three cell types as a 1.3 kilobase band on Northern blot analysis. A second messenger ribonucleic acid species measuring 2.1 kilobase was abundantly present in the granulosa cells. Whether these two species of messenger ribonucleic acid are involved in the regulation of the estradiol dehydrogenase genes is yet to be determined.\r"

Subjects were evaluated during four sequential monthly admissions during which multiple blood samples were obtained every 15 minutes for 8 hours. Patients were studied during a baseline cycle, after administration of RU 486 alone (100 mg/day), naloxone with RU 486, and naloxone alone. After administration of RU 486 there was a significant decline in total luteinizing hormone secretion (p less than 0.01) and luteinizing hormone pulse amplitude (p less than 0.05), but compared with baseline there was no significant change in luteinizing hormone pulse frequency. After infusion of naloxone there was a significant increase in mean luteinizing hormone values (p less than 0.05) and luteinizing hormone pulse frequency (p less than 0.01) but no change in pulse amplitude. There was no significant difference in mean luteinizing hormone values or luteinizing hormone pulse amplitude and frequency between administration of RU 486 and naloxone plus RU 486. Administration of naloxone alone, RU 486 alone, and RU 486 plus naloxone caused a significant increase in cortisol as compared with baseline cycles (p less than 0.05). These data further support the notion that progesterone is important in the control of luteinizing hormone secretion and suggest that progesterone may primarily influence luteinizing hormone pulse amplitude and pituitary release of luteinizing hormone during the luteal phase.\r"

Integrated progesterone output for 7 days after luteinizing hormone surge calculated from the daily plasma progesterone levels was 66.6 +/- 9.8 ng/ml in the control group compared with 117.5 +/- 18.6 ng/ml for clomiphene citrate 50 mg treatment and 152.1 +/- 11 ng/ml for clomiphene citrate 150 mg treatment (p less than or equal to 0.05). Only one cycle (clomiphene citrate 150 mg) had an out-of-phase endometrium and a significantly reduced integrated progesterone output of 28 ng/ml. All other cycles showed synchronous endometrial maturation. We conclude that luteal insufficiency as a result of clomiphene citrate treatment in ovulatory women is infrequent and is more likely to be a result of functional outcome of a relative lack of luteal phase progesterone output.\r"

  ".W": "Women with polycystic ovarian disease and hyperthecosis have hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. It is possible that insulin in supraphysiologic concentration exerts its steroidogenic action on ovarian stromal cells through insulin-like growth factor I receptors. We undertook this study to investigate whether the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis has specific binding sites for insulin or insulin-like growth factor I. Ovarian stromal tissue was obtained from seven women with normal ovulatory cycles and from five women with hyperthecosis of the ovaries. Binding studies with insulin tagged with iodine 125 and insulin-like growth factor I tagged with iodine 125 revealed specific binding sites both for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I in the ovarian stroma. The binding of insulin tagged with iodine 125 in the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis (3.4% +/- 1.1% (+/- SE) per 100 micrograms protein) was significantly (p less than 0.04) lower than that observed in normal premenopausal women (8.3% +/- 1.6% per 100 micrograms protein). By contrast, the specific binding of insulin-like growth factor I tagged with iodine 125 in the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis (7.1% +/- 1.7% per 100 micrograms protein) was higher than that observed in the ovarian stroma from normal women (4.5% +/- 1.7% per 100 micrograms protein), although the difference was not statistically significant. The affinity constants for these high-affinity receptors were similar (1.2 to 3.6 x 10(9) L/mol) in the two groups of women. These results indicate that (1) the ovarian stroma has specific binding sites both for insulin and for insulin-like growth factor I; (2) in women with hyperthecosis, the ovarian stroma has decreased binding sites for insulin but has normal concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I receptors; and (3) in women with hyperthecosis, stimulation of ovarian androgen synthesis by insulin may be mediated through the insulin-like growth factor I receptors.\r"

The preembryos were collected in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline solution with 0.01% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.1 mol/L sucrose, and 4 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin to facilitate removal of blastomeres. This allows entry of a fine micropipette into the perivitelline cavity with subsequent removal of a single blastomere by gentle suction. The majority of embryos (75%) from which biopsy specimens were obtained in this fashion developed to the blastocyst stage. The blastomeres obtained were mainly intact and they were fixed to glass slides. After permeabilization, in situ hybridization was performed with chromosome X- and chromosome 3-specific probes. Human unfertilized eggs and blastomeres from human polyspermic embryos also have been analyzed by in situ hybridization with chromosome specific probes. The combination of nondestructive embryo biopsy and in situ hybridization is a possible approach for preimplantation genetic diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "In the clinical practice of human in vitro fertilization, pregnancy is dependent on embryo implantation. Pregnancy is a function of the number of embryos transferred, with multiple embryos resulting in a higher likelihood of pregnancy. We formulated a mathematic model of embryo implantation. This model describes embryo implantation as dependent on three factors--transfer efficiency, embryo quality, and endometrial receptivity. Application of existing embryo implantation data to this model allows the calculation of the approximate value of each of these factors. On the basis of historic data, data obtained from our in vitro fertilization program, and these theoretic considerations, it is our hypothesis that (1) there is an inherent inefficiency associated with the mechanical transfer of embryos into the uterine cavity, which limits the maximal embryo implantation rate; (2) the quality of embryos produced by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, follicle aspiration, and in vitro fertilization is very high and approaches that of embryos produced in natural cycles in vivo; and (3) endometrial receptivity is markedly diminished in stimulated cycles and is the current rate-limiting step of pregnancy success of in vitro fertilization.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacokinetally, a 50 micrograms oral dose of mestranol (which itself is inactive) is bioequivalent to a 35 micrograms dose of ethinyl estradiol. Physiologically, mestranol ranges from 50% to 100% of the activity of ethinyl estradiol, depending on the endpoint chosen. Compounds such as these, which are metabolized with a first-pass effect and are enterohepatically recirculated, demonstrate large interindividual and intraindividual variability in their pharmacokinetics. Thus a given dose of ethinyl estradiol in one person may produce an effect equivalent to a substantially larger (or smaller) dose in another person. This wide variability confounds efforts to establish tight dose-response relationships, a point rarely considered in clinical or epidemiologic studies of these compounds. The circulating levels of ethinyl estradiol sulfates may be higher than those of free ethinyl estradiol itself. It has been thought that these sulfates represent a \"reservoir\" of ethinyl estradiol. Our studies show that this idea is untenable because the half-life of the sulfates is not long enough for such an effect. Differences in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and mestranol have been observed in studies of various populations. The reality of these group differences is affirmed by analyses of urinary metabolite patterns.\r"

  ".W": "A number of oral contraceptive steroids undergo first-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol (mean systemic bioavailability 40% to 50%) is extensively metabolized, principally to a sulfate conjugate. In vivo studies that use portal vein catheterization and the administration of radiolabeled ethinyl estradiol have shown that the fraction of steroid metabolized in the gut wall is 0.44. In vitro studies with jejunal biopsy samples or larger pieces of jejunum or terminal ileum mounted in Ussing chambers have indicated that more than 30% of added ethinyl estradiol is sulfated. The progestogen desogestrel is a prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite 3-ketodesogestrel. Substantial first-pass metabolism of desogestrel occurs in the gut mucosa, with evidence from Ussing chamber studies for the formation of the active metabolite. Another progestogen, norgestimate, is also metabolized by the gut wall in vitro of which the principal metabolite is the deacetylated product, norgestrel oxime. It seems very likely that this will also occur in vivo. Drug interactions occurring in the gut wall have been reported with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and paracetamol.\r"

Animal studies show convincing evidence of the importance of the enterohepatic circulation, but studies in humans are much less convincing. The importance of the route and the rate of metabolism of ethinyl estradiol are reviewed. Some antibiotics have been reported anecdotally to reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptive steroids, but controlled studies have not confirmed this observation. Although gut flora are altered by oral antibiotics, the blood levels of ethinyl estradiol are not reduced, and one antibiotic at least (cotrimoxazole) enhances the activity of ethinyl estradiol.\r"

Pharmacokinetic interactions with oral contraceptives may occur (1) during absorption and extrahepatic circulation, (2) by interfering with protein binding, and (3) during hepatic metabolism. The hepatic mixed function oxidase system, which is mainly responsible for the metabolism of oral contraceptives, is affected by several different factors and is easily induced. Nutrition affects the activity of many drugs, but information regarding oral contraceptives is meager. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, which may be synergistic or antagonistic, between the estrogen and gestagen components of oral contraceptives, are important, but there is no correlation between the rate of metabolism of the two components. Evidence suggests that some anticonvulsant, antibiotic, and antibacterial drugs may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Instances of interactions of other therapeutic agents are reported infrequently. The incidence of serious interactions is low and does not appear to have been reduced with low-dose oral contraceptives, probably because of large intersubject variability in the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives.\r"

The literature indicates that 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, and norgestrel are competitive inhibitors and that primaquine and tolbutamide are rather weak noncompetitive inhibitors. Recent experiments in this laboratory indicate that gestodene is a relatively potent mechanism-based inactivator of cytochrome P-450 IIIA4 in vitro. Inhibition requires incubation with the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, is time and concentration dependent, and can be partially blocked by the presence of noninhibitory cytochrome P-450 IIIA4 substrates. The in vitro activation by gestodene provides a possible explanation for the increase in plasma estrogen levels reported in women administered gestodene along with 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol.\r"

In mammals aromatic hydroxylation is most prominent quantitatively. The 2- and 4-hydroxyestrogens (catecholestrogens) formed are secreted not only in high amounts in urine but are also present in significant quantities in different organs, such as the liver, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus. This A ring hydroxylation of primary estrogens is affected by peroxidases, tyrosinases, and unspecific monooxygenases by mechanisms still not completely understood. The activity of the aromatic hydroxylases is regulated not only with respect to the overall extent but also to the relative rate of hydroxylation at C-atoms 2 and 4. The metabolism of catecholestrogens may be divided into reversible and irreversible reactions, of which the reaction with the catechol-O-methyltransferase, and thereby the interaction with catecholamines, the conjugation, and the thioether formation are the most prominent. Low- and high-affinity binding is operative in binding to plasma proteins and receptors. Finally, irreversible binding to cellular macromolecules, such as proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid, and the oncogenic potential of natural and synthetic catecholestrogens are discussed.\r"

Generalizations cannot be made except that the lapse of time until peak blood values of the active drug have been reached are always greater after intake of the prodrug than after intake of the drug. This finding is presumably of no clinical importance. If pharmacokinetic differences are limited to the phase of distribution, bioequivalence may be assumed. If, on the other hand, the area under the curve during the elimination phase is smaller for the prodrug than for the drug, the potency of the former should be decreased. A shift in the spectrum of endocrine actions as a result of the biotransformation of the prodrug into the active drug is rather the exception than the rule, and so is a change in side effects. If there are major differences in this respect, metabolic pathways in addition to those leading to the respective active drug must also be taken into consideration.\r"

With the present tendency to decrease the doses of both estrogens and progestogens, any factor that reduces the bioavailability of the lower-dose preparations may have an impact on contraceptive protection. Although ethinyl estradiol, the most commonly used oral estrogen, is liable to an enterohepatic circulation as unchanged drug, the commonly used progestogens are not. At present, no convincing evidence exists in the human subject that disruption of the enterohepatic circulation by antibiotics or antacids does reduce contraceptive efficacy of the pill. Oral contraceptive steroids are mainly absorbed from the small bowel, and contraceptive efficacy depends on its absorptive capacity. Enhanced passage of gastrointestinal contents or impaired absorption may thus contribute to contraceptive failures in patients who have chronic inflammatory disease, diarrhea, ileostomy, or jejunoileal bypass.\r"

To the present knowledge, phase I (i.e., oxidation, demethylation) and phase II reactions (conjugation) are concerned. Drugs sharing those enzymatic systems with oral contraceptives experience either an increase in bioavailability by inhibition of oxidative metabolism or undergo accelerated elimination by induced conjugation. Such interaction may be of practical interest in subjects who take oral contraceptives and are simultaneously treated with antidepressants, antihypertensives, insulin, synthetic glucocorticoids, theophylline, and caffeine.\r"

Five were exposed to oxygen/carbon dioxide alone and 12 to oxygen/carbon dioxide with 1.5% halothane. A mixture of 10 essential amino acids was added to the perfusate of six of the halothane-exposed livers to a concentration approximately 10 times the normal rat plasma level. Perfusate concentrations of newly synthesized albumin were measured by radial immunodiffusion, and the rate of synthesis for the 4.25-h study period was calculated. The mean +/- SEM albumin synthetic rate (mg/h per 300-g rat) in the control group (12.13 +/- 1.36) was significantly greater than in the group receiving halothane alone (6.98 +/- 0.92). Amino acid treatment failed to prevent halothane depression of albumin synthesis (8.68 +/- 0.84).

Twenty patients were randomized to have one catheter (paravertebral tip location) or two catheters (paravertebral and lateral thoracic wall tip locations). Interpleural catheters were sutured to the parietal pleura by the surgeon at time of wound closure. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine through the single catheter or 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with or without 1:200,000 epinephrine through each of the two catheters while supine. Bupivacaine concentrations in whole blood and in thoracostomy drainage fluid were assayed by gas chromatography. Actual content of bupivacaine in the drainage fluid was calculated. Degree of analgesia was assessed by verbal numerical pain scores over the first 4 h and opioid demand thereafter. Addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine did not influence the degree of analgesia. Approximately 30%-40% of any administered dose of bupivacaine was lost via the thoracostomy tube over a 4-h period. There was no correlation between the true initial dose (100 mg minus thoracostomy drainage) and Cmax. Use of two catheters resulted in significantly less opioid requirements after an initial 8-h period. Failure to achieve adequate interpleural analgesia in postthoracotomy patients may be related to loss of anesthetic via thoracostomy drainage, presence of extravasated blood and tissue fluid in the pleural space, and possibly sequestration and channeling of flow of local anesthetic by restricted motion of an operated lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Halothane significantly decreased effective refractory period and action potential duration in Purkinje fibers. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation restored effective refractory period and action potential duration in Purkinje fibers exposed to halothane via an alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated effect antagonized by prazosin. Halothane significantly slowed propagation of impulses initiated at a basic cycle length of 500 ms, and conduction of premature impulses, in Purkinje fibers. In the presence of halothane, alpha-adrenergic stimulation had no additional effects on normal impulse propagation; however, alpha-adrenergic stimulation significantly slowed the conduction of premature impulses in Purkinje fibers exposed to halothane. These data refute a previous report that alpha-adrenergic stimulation enhances halothane's negative dromotropic effect in Purkinje fibers paced at a basic drive cycle length. alpha-Adrenergic prolongation of the conduction times of premature stimuli in Purkinje fibers exposed to halothane is a new finding.\r"

Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to one of two drug treatment groups of eight dogs each. The first group (G1) was treated with 0.4 mg/kg hydralazine administered as a bolus. The second group (G2) received prostaglandin E1 given as an infusion for a total dose of 0.8 micrograms/kg. Regional myocardial function was assessed through the measurement of myocardial segment shortening during systole. We call this index percent systolic shortening (%SS). An ischemic heart preparation was created by partial occlusion of coronary blood flow. The degree of induced ischemia was determined by following the reduction in %SS. Hydralazine reduced %SS of the ischemic myocardium while increasing the cardiac index, stroke volume index, and coronary blood flow. Prostaglandin E1 increased %SS, cardiac index, and stroke volume index in the ischemic heart preparation. Hydralazine, therefore, induced dissociation between global ventricular function and regional myocardial function whereas prostaglandin E1 did not. The present findings emphasize that evaluation of vasoactive drugs should consider their effects on regional myocardial function as well as on global hemodynamics.\r"

Succinylcholine was administered either 1 min (group 1) or 6 min (groups 2 and 3) after induction of anesthesia with thiopental. In group 2, anesthesia was maintained with thiopental and the patients' lungs were ventilated with oxygen. In group 3, anesthesia was maintained with only 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve was started 30 s before the administration of succinylcholine and repeated every 12 s. The force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was measured. Maximum blockade (mean +/- SEM) did not vary significantly between group 1, where thiopental had been administered for 1 min, and group 2, where it had been administered for 6 min (group 1: 61% +/- 6%; group 2: 54% +/- 8%). However, the addition of nitrous oxide increased neuromuscular blockade (group 3: 80% +/- 6%; P less than 0.05 compared with group 2). The degree of twitch augmentation, i.e., greater than maximal response, and times to twitch augmentation and to maximum blockade did not vary significantly among the groups. It is concluded that nitrous oxide increases succinylcholine neuromuscular blockade and that this is manifest within 6 min. This effect is not due to the duration of the anesthetic because thiopental, administered over a similar time period, did not potentiate succinylcholine.\r"

Steal-prone anatomy was found in 31.8% of patients who had received enflurane; 40.0%, halothane; 32.6%, isoflurane; and 31.7%, sufentanil. Detected by greater than or equal to 0.1 mV ST segment displacement, ischemia during anesthesia occurred in 290 (30.4%) of all patients with no difference in the incidence among the four primary anesthetics (27.5%-32.9%). Patients with steal-prone anatomy did not suffer more ischemia than patients who needed coronary artery bypass surgery but with other varieties of coronary anatomy. In patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy, the incidence of myocardial ischemia by primary anesthetic was 24.0% with enflurane, 34.4% with halothane, 32.1% with isoflurane, and 38.2% with sufentanil. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg during anesthesia occurred in 416 (45.6%) patients and was twice as common during administration of volatile anesthetics than during that of sufentanil. Hypotension did not increase ischemia frequency in patients with steal-prone anatomy with use of any of the four primary anesthetics including isoflurane. Ischemia was temporally related to hypotension in only 9 patients (0.9%). In none of the 42 patients who had steal-prone anatomy and hypotension during isoflurane anesthesia was ischemia temporally related to hypotension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After induction of anesthesia with etomidate, all patients were ventilated with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen.

In all groups SAP decreased significantly below baseline levels for the duration of the measurements (15 min after drug administration), except for the lower dose of thiopental, where SAP returned to baseline values within 10 min. Propofol at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg significantly decreased cardiac output (CO) (from 5.1 +/- 0.25 [mean +/- SEM] to 4.2 +/- 0.23 L/min), stroke volume (SV) (from 64 +/- 3 to 56 +/- 3.6 mL), and the slope of E (from 71 +/- 3.5 to 65 +/- 4.2 mm Hg/mL) until 4 min after drug administration.

  ".W": "Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal, anesthetic-induced syndrome. Currently, the only accurate means of diagnosing susceptibility to this syndrome is the testing of biopsied skeletal muscle for its contracture response to halothane and caffeine. A less invasive means of diagnosis is needed. The authors previously reported that MH-susceptible patients studied by in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy demonstrated a higher resting inorganic phosphate (Pi) to phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio in their skeletal muscle, as well as a slower postexercise recovery of PCr/Pi, when compared to normal controls. In the present blinded study, the authors compared in vivo 31P NMR determination of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi in forearm muscles to in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test results in 42 patients. Forty-three control subjects were studied to establish normal NMR values of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi. Their findings were compared with those of 27 patients shown to be MH-susceptible and 15 patients MH-negative by contracture testing. The MH-susceptible group had a significantly (P less than 0.005) higher resting Pi/PCr value (0.202 +/- 0.044) than either the MH-negative (0.152 +/- 0.043) or the control (0.141 +/- 0.026) group. The MH-susceptible group also had a significantly (P less than 0.02) slower postexercise recovery rate of PCr/Pi (1.50 +/- 0.872 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) than either the MH-negative (2.11 +/- 1.07 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) or control (2.25 +/- 0.828 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) group. Twenty-six of the 27 MH-susceptible patients demonstrated abnormal NMR test results (a resting Pi/PCr greater than or equal to 0.18 or recovery rate less than 1.0 PCr.Pi-1.min-1), and 13 of the 15 MH-negative patients had normal NMR results. Although neither NMR parameter alone was diagnostically reliable, an NMR test utilizing both parameters was quite accurate. The NMR test and contracture test demonstrated an overall agreement of 93% with a copositivity of 96% and conegativity of 87%. The sensitivity and specificity of the NMR test is estimated to be 98.8% +/- 11.8% and 95.3% +/- 20.3%, respectively. The role of 31P NMR in the diagnosis of MH susceptibility and possible mechanisms underlying the observations are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "In 21 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured during hypothermic nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass to test the hypothesis that isoflurane abolished the mean arterial pressure-CBF relation (pressure-flow autoregulation). Cerebral blood flow was determined by 133Xe clearance. The patients were randomly divided into three groups according to anesthesia during cardiopulmonary bypass: group 1 received midazolam and fentanyl; group 2 received, in addition to midazolam and fentanyl, 0.6% isoflurane; and group 3 received, in addition to midazolam and fentanyl, 1.2% isoflurane. The groups were maintained at a constant temperature, PaO2, PaCO2, and pump flow during CBF measurements. Mean arterial pressure was increased by phenylephrine greater than or equal to 25% after the first CBF determination. Isoflurane decreased mean arterial pressure significantly (P less than 0.05) and was associated with lower CBF. Increasing the mean arterial pressure 29% in group 1, 25% in group 2, and 34% in group 3 had no effect on CBF. We conclude that, within the range studied, pressure-flow CBF autoregulation is preserved during isoflurane anesthesia administered for cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

We compared the effects of halothane on impulse propagation in Purkinje fibers with its effects on impulse propagation across the Purkinje-muscle (P-M) junction. In canine Purkinje fibers, halothane (3%) significantly depressed conduction (P less than 0.05). Exposure to halothane altered conduction velocity (theta) in a manner predicted by cable theory; a significant correlation was noted between depression of Vmax and depression of the square of conduction velocity (theta 2) in Purkinje fibers exposed to 3% halothane (n = 11, r = 0.78, P less than 0.01). Halothane (3%) significantly slowed impulse propagation across the P-M junction (P less than 0.05). Vmax and the square of apparent P-M conduction velocity were not significantly correlated (n = 7, r = 0.34, P = 0.45). The data demonstrate that alteration of active membrane properties can account for halothane's slowing of conduction in Purkinje fibers but not for its slowing of conduction across the P-M junction. The data also suggest that a reduction in cell-to-cell coupling may contribute to depression of Purkinje-to-muscle conduction by halothane.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in 30 patients having epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery, the analgesic efficacy and side effects when a combination of epidural morphine, a mu-receptor agonist, and butorphanol, a mu-receptor antagonist and kappa-receptor agonist, was administered. After clamping of the umbilical cord, patients received 4 mg epidural morphine with 3 mL of normal saline (group 1), 4 mg epidural morphine with 1 mg butorphanol and 2 mL of normal saline (group 2), or 4 mg epidural morphine with 3 mg butorphanol (group 3). Patients were monitored for 24 h after administration of the study medications. There were no significant differences between the groups in visual analogue pain scores, time to first analgesic request, respiratory rate, or Trieger dot test performance in the 24 h immediately after these epidural injections. There were three patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 who experienced oxygen saturations less than 90%. (No patients in group 3 developed an oxygen saturation less than 92%.) The patients in group 3 did not require treatment for pruritus or nausea, a response significantly different (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05, respectively) from group 1 or group 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were assigned in a double-blind randomized fashion to receive a standardized general anesthetic followed by an intramuscular dose of either ephedrine (0.5 mg/kg), droperidol (0.04 mg/kg), or saline before the conclusion of surgery. Nausea, retching, or vomiting, as well as the degree of sedation and discharge times, were assessed in the recovery room and for 24 h postoperatively. Ephedrine was found to have a significantly antiemetic effect (P less than 0.05) when compared with placebo and an antiemetic effect similar to that of droperidol. Sedation scores were also significantly less in the ephedrine group than in both placebo and droperidol groups. Finally, variations in mean arterial blood pressure among the three groups were not statistically significant. We conclude that ephedrine is an effective antiemetic agent with minimal sedative side effects in patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopy.\r"

There was no change in sinus node automaticity or sinus node recovery time at any concentration and no evidence of abnormal automaticity. Depression of conduction was reflected by prolongation of the PR interval at the following concentrations: 1.5 micrograms/mL (65.0 ms before, 96.6 ms after) and 3.0 micrograms/mL (61.6 ms before, 103.3 ms after) and increase in atrial and ventricular pacing thresholds at 3.0 micrograms/mL (atrial: 0.86-8.6 mA, ventricular: 2.0-10.0 mA). No spontaneous tachyarrhythmias occurred; 2:1 spontaneous atrioventricular block (n = 1) and a decrease in maximal paced rate with 1:1 anterograde or retrograde atrioventricular conduction were noted at all concentrations of bupivacaine. Thus bupivacaine did not change automaticity but had a depressant effect on conduction at the atrial, ventricular, and atrioventricular levels, providing a basis for clinically occurring atrioventricular block and reentrant arrhythmias.\r"

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) were determined using a sagittal sinus outflow technique. At 1.4% expired isoflurane, 70% nitrous oxide increased CBF but had no effect on CMRO2. At 3.1% expired isoflurane, 70% nitrous oxide had no effect on either CBF or CMRO2. The latter concentration of isoflurane rendered the EEG isoelectric, but when nitrous oxide was added, EEG activity reappeared. To again produce an isoelectric EEG required an increase in the isoflurane concentration to 3.5% +/- 0.2% (with no further effect on CMRO2). The authors also found that at 1.4% isoflurane, 0.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of angiotensin significantly decreased CMRO2 without any effect on CBF. It is concluded that nitrous oxide, when added to isoflurane concentrations ranging from 1.4% to 3.5% in the dog, increases CBF at the low but not the high isoflurane concentrations although it has no effect on CMRO2.\r"

  ".W": "We studied in patients the effect of d-tubocurarine, which has sympathetic ganglion blocking action, on succinylcholine-induced increases in plasma levels of catecholamines, and compared it with the effects of vecuronium and pancuronium, which have little sympathetic ganglion blocking action. Thirty-two patients were divided into five groups: seven were given 3 mL saline; seven received 1 mg/kg succinylcholine; and six, seven, and five patients were given 0.08 mg/kg d-tubocurarine, 0.01 mg/kg vecuronium, and 0.01 mg/kg pancuronium, respectively, all of which were injected 5 min before 1 mg/kg succinylcholine. Succinylcholine alone significantly increased plasma norepinephrine concentrations, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate from 187 +/- 39 pg/mL (mean +/- SEM), 93 +/- 2 mm Hg, and 77 +/- 4 beats/min to 429 +/- 61 pg/mL, 120 +/- 7 mm Hg, and 102 +/- 6 beats/min, respectively, with onset of fasciculations. Pretreatment with d-tubocurarine, vecuronium, and pancuronium significantly and equally attenuated both the fasciculations and the cardiovascular responses to succinylcholine. These results suggest that the sympathetic ganglion blocking action of neuromuscular relaxants when given before succinylcholine is not an important factor in attenuation of succinylcholine-induced increases in plasma levels of catecholamines.\r"

  ".W": "Obese patients have a decreased functional residual capacity and, hence, a reduced oxygen supply during periods of apnea. To determine whether obese patients are at greater risk of developing hypoxemia during induction of anesthesia than patients of normal weight, 24 patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were studied. Group 1 (normal) were within 20% of their ideal body weight. Group 2 (obese) were more than 20% but less than 45.5 kg over ideal body weight. Group 3 (morbidly obese) were more than 45.5 kg over ideal body weight. Patients were preoxygenated for 5 min or until expired nitrogen was less than 5%. After induction of anesthesia and muscle relaxation the patients were allowed to remain apneic until arterial saturation as measured by pulse oximetry reached 90%. The time taken for oxygen saturation to decrease to 90% was 364 +/- 24 s in group 1, 247 +/- 21 s in group 2, and 163 +/- 15 s in group 3; these times are significantly different at P less than 0.05 between groups. Regression analysis of the data demonstrated a significant negative linear correlation (r = -0.83) between time to desaturation and increasing obesity. These results show that obese patients are at an increased risk of developing hypoxemia when apneic.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical suitability of intraoperative autotransfusion was evaluated in 25 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation using a Cell Saver #4 (Haemonetics) with acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulation. In the first 14 patients (phase 1), biochemical, hematologic, coagulation, and semiquantitative bacteriologic studies were performed from the collected blood, processed blood, and patients' blood before and after 500 mL of autotransfusion. The acid-citrate-dextrose solution produced adequate anticoagulation, and the system effectively removed most of the potassium, red blood cell fragments, plasma free hemoglobin, bilirubin, coagulation factors, platelets, and fibrin degradation products. Autotransfusion (500 mL) did not alter coagulation, electrolyte balance, and hematologic findings in recipients except for a clinically insignificant increase in plasma free hemoglobin. Seventeen of 56 samples of the collected blood or processed blood were positive for coagulase (-) Staphylococcus (occasional or rare), but blood cultures before and after autotransfusion were negative in all patients. In the next 11 patients (phase 2), a quantitative bacteriologic study was performed from the collected blood, processed blood, skin, bile duct stump, peritoneal cavity, and room air using a mock reservoir. The processed blood was not transfused. All blood cultures from the patients were sterile. However, coagulase (-) Staphylococcus or Bacillus sp was seen in two cultures from skin, three from the processed blood, and three from air, suggesting that room air and skin were the sources of contamination. When the patients of the two phases of study were compared, postoperative blood cultures were all sterile, and renal function was similar. Therefore, autotransfusion appears to be clinically acceptable during liver transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 312 asthmatic patients skin tested, 29 (9.3%) had positive reactions (wheal greater than or equal to 6 mm) to rice pollen extract at a concentration of 10(-5) g/mL and the remaining 283 (90.7%) were negative. While eight (34.8%) of the 23 ST-positive patients were also RAST-positive, RAST was negative in all 34 ST-negative patients and 20 normals. Immunoblotting revealed three major allergens, with molecular weights of 16 kD, 26 kD, and 32 kD, respectively. Interestingly, RAST-positive patients showed IgE responses to most allergens but only a few of them had IgG antibodies, while normal controls had stronger IgG responses to the same allergens, particularly to 32 kD, but none had IgE antibody. The preliminary results of rice pollen protein induced-lymphoproliferation were not informative; thus, rice pollen proteins do elicit a specific response in asthmatic children and normals, but its pathogenic role in bronchial asthma needs further study.\r"

Sulfurous water (S-H2O) therapy did not modify the phenotype and function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) nor did it modify systemic immunologic reactivity. A different result was obtained by analyzing the response to mitogens of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in cell cultures containing graduated amounts of S-H2O. These \"in vitro\" studies have shown an important dose-dependent inhibitory effect of S-H2O on mitogen induced T lymphocyte proliferation and on IL2 production. H2S present in S-H2O seems to be the primary component responsible for inhibition. Our results are consistent with a local immunosuppressive role of S-H2O, which may explain part of the observed therapeutic effect of inhalation therapy on upper respiratory allergic disorders.\r"

Electrophoresis of the pinon nut extract demonstrated 30 bands, three of which (in the 66 to 68,000 dalton range) bound IgE in the patient's serum in an immunoblot. Ingestion challenge was not performed due to the severity of the patient's reaction. Although used for centuries in certain cultures, pinon nuts are now being eaten more frequently in the American diet. Physicians should be aware of the potential for anaphylactic reactions following ingestion of this food.\r"

Wheezing was observed in 32 (12.5%) of the 256 patients with KD. Patients who had a prior history of bronchial asthma wheezed more frequently than other patients. During the acute stage of KD, plasma i-LTC4 levels both of wheezing and nonwheezing were significantly higher than those of healthy children. During the convalescent stage, plasma i-LTC4 levels of wheezing cases were higher than those of nonwheezing cases. We speculate that LTC4 contributes to the appearance of inflammatory symptoms during the acute stage of KD. During the convalescent stage when patients were taking aspirin, the presence of wheezing was associated with increased plasma levels of i-LTC4. More attention should be paid to the appearance of wheezing during the course of KD, especially in those cases in which the patient has a prior history of bronchial asthma.\r"

Two groups of asthmatic patients were studied: 12 asthmatics allergic to house dust mites and seven nonallergic asthmatics. The baseline FEV1 was similar in the two groups. Each subject was challenged through a nasal mask connected to nebulizer filled with house dust. Patients were randomly assigned to inhale dust with high or low Group I allergenic level. All allergic patients had an FEV1 drop larger than 20% of the baseline value. This drop was maximal at the 30th minute after challenge. FEV1 remained unchanged in nonallergic asthmatics. Allergic patients challenged with high Group I allergenic house dust (8.4 micrograms/g) had a mean FEV1 drop larger (P less than .01) than those challenged with the low Group I allergenic house dust (0.66 micrograms/g). Late asthmatic reactions were found in only two patients who were challenged with the high Group I allergenic house dust. These two patients had immediate FEV1 drops greater than 50% of the baseline value. Occurrence of symptoms during the test and the drop in FEV1 were correlated (r = .3; P less than .05). Natural exposure to house dust can induce immediate bronchial in allergic asthmatics in a dose-dependent manner.\r"
