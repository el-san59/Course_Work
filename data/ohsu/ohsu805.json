Hirudin consists of an NH2-terminal globular domain and a long (39 A) COOH-terminal extended domain. Residues Ile1 to Tyr3 of hirudin form a parallel beta-strand with Ser214 to Glu217 of thrombin with the nitrogen atom of Ile1 making a hydrogen bond with Ser195 O gamma atom of the catalytic site, but the specificity pocket of thrombin is not involved in the interaction. The COOH-terminal segment makes numerous electrostatic interactions with an anion-binding exosite of thrombin, whereas the last five residues are in a helical loop that forms many hydrophobic contacts. In all, 27 of the 65 residues of hirudin have contacts less than 4.0 A with thrombin (10 ion pairs and 23 hydrogen bonds). Such abundant interactions may account for the high affinity and specificity of hirudin.\r"

Hydrophobic residues from the helices and a short three residue beta sheet at the interface of the two sites act to stabilize the protein domain in the presence of Ca. A synthetic 34-residue peptide representing one of these sites (site III) has been synthesized and studied by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In solution this peptide undergoes a Ca-induced conformational change to form the helix-loop-helix Ca-binding motif. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectra have provided evidence for the formation of a beta sheet and interactions between several hydrophobic residues from opposing helices as found in troponin-C. It is proposed that a symmetric two-site dimer similar in tertiary structure to the carboxyl-terminal domain of troponin-C forms from the assembly of two site III peptides in the Ca-bound form.\r"

Naturally processed minor H peptides were found to be similar to those artificial CTL-epitopes, as far as size and hydrophobicity is concerned.

This calcium response was not present in denuded oocytes, indicating that it is mediated by AII receptors on the adherent follicular cells. The endogenous AII receptors differed in their binding properties from mammalian AII receptors expressed on the oocyte surface after injection of rat adrenal messenger RNA. Also, the calcium responses to activation of the amphibian AII receptor, but not the expressed mammalian AII receptor, were blocked reversibly by octanol and intracellular acidification, treatments that inhibit cell coupling through gap junctions. In addition, AII increased the rate of progesterone-induced maturation. Thus, an AII-induced calcium-mobilizing signal is transferred from follicle cells to the oocyte through gap junctions and may play a physiological role in oocyte maturation.\r"

In matched cases, results and complications are the same for TUIP and TURP except for the troublesome bladder neck contracture and the higher incidence of reflex into the seminal vesicles and sexual complications after resection of the prostate. Transurethral incision is unsuitable for large prostates. As for economics, compassion and wisdom in fee collection are justified. Cost reduction in health care may be necessary, but it hurts everyone involved. There is no such thing as unnecessary surgery when the critics are charged with decision making about the health and life of the patient before surgery. Finally, before the advent of the third-party payment, operations were avoided because of the financial burden. The surgeon, the patient, and the relatives silently consented to no care. This \"silent consent\" did not improve the quality of life but did contain costs--as well as longevity.\r"

Alpha blockers and balloons still produce unpredictable results, and neither alternative duplicates the results of transurethral resection. If, however, the patient is not in serious voiding trouble and is willing to exercise genuine patience, one approach could be a blocker if he has early symptoms and is not in trouble; otherwise, use the balloon. When either or both fail, TURP is required if the patient's condition permits, for TURP remains the standard. Objective assessment with an open mind is essential. Balloon dilatation is a safe, simple, but unpredictable alternative to transurethral resection. It may be done on an ambulatory basis, although it requires anesthesia, and has led to neither impotence or incontinence. It may be performed on the limited-risk patient. It has succeeded in two thirds of patients in retention or who did not respond to alpha blockers. Nonetheless, objective measures of success rarely duplicate those regularly achieved by TURP.\r"

Blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, and periodically for 72 hours postinfusion. Diazepam plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC. Concentrations at five minutes (end of infusion) ranged from 0 to 889 ng/mL. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was observed at 5 minutes for 10 treatments, at 20 minutes for 7 treatments, and at 30 minutes for 1 treatment. The observed Cmax ranged from 221 to 889 ng/mL. When time to reach peak plasma concentration (tmax) was 5 minutes, the Cmax was significantly greater than when tmax was 20 minutes (670 +/- 87 vs. 267 +/- 40 ng/mL, p less than 0.005). The area under the curve did not differ significantly between these two groups. The pain score at the end of infusion ranged from zero to five and was inversely related to the concentration at five minutes (r2 = 0.45, p = 0.002). The association between venous irritation, a low plasma concentration at the end of the infusion, and a delayed Cmax suggests that diazepam precipitated in the vein.\r"

All four treatments were equivalent in terms of the dose of quinidine base. Multiple serum samples and two 24-hour urine specimens were collected over 24 and 48 hours, respectively, and assayed for quinidine with a specific HPLC assay method. For the absorption and disposition parameters measured (maximum serum concentration, time to reach maximum concentration, area under the concentration-time curve [0-48 hours], absorption and elimination rate constants, absorption and elimination half-lives, apparent total body clearance, apparent volume of distribution, and dose fraction excreted in the urine) no significant differences were observed for any of the parameters among the four treatments (p greater than 0.05). The results of the present investigation demonstrated that QP and QS produced identical serum quinidine concentration-time curves when given in the form of a tablet or liquid. The clinical implications of these observations with respect to the dosing of QP are discussed.\r"

Unlike children, adults with cystic fibrosis must take responsibility for their own care. We administered a questionnaire to 23 adult patients (aged 18-39 years) with cystic fibrosis to (1) determine patients' degree of compliance with medications and chest physiotherapy; (2) collect information on their self-assessment of health motivation, disease severity, and benefits of treatment; and (3) identify barriers to receiving medical care. Patients reported better compliance with medications than with chest physiotherapy. Nine percent of the patients missed at least 25 percent of prescribed medication, whereas 47 percent missed at least 25 percent of prescribed physiotherapy. We observed a trend toward better compliance in patients who were highly worried about their health, who believed their illness to be serious, and who felt that their medications were very effective. Less than half of the study participants believed physiotherapy to be effective, and that adhering to a physiotherapy schedule was very difficult. Among adults with cystic fibrosis, compliance can be a serious problem that minimizes the benefits of good medical care. We suggest that emphasizing the severity of disease and usefulness of therapy may improve compliance and requires study.\r"

When binding alterations are present, total drug concentrations may mislead clinicians in evaluating patient response. We describe a case in which profound hypoalbuminemia (0.2 g/dL), associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, produced toxic free phenytoin concentrations (4.9 micrograms/mL) in an HIV-positive 25-year-old black woman. At such a high serum concentration of free phenytoin, the patient exhibited seizure-like effects.

A 24-year-old white woman, 17 days postpartum, was being treated for resolving acute renal failure. Oral ciprofloxacin was prescribed for a suspected urinary tract infection. Due to suspected pediatric toxicity and a lack of published information describing ciprofloxacin excretion in breast milk, the antibiotic was discontinued after one 500-mg dose. All breast milk was collected at four-hour intervals and was tested for the presence of ciprofloxacin by bioassay. Ciprofloxacin breast milk concentrations were 9.1, 9.1, 9.1, and 6.0 mumol/L at 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours postdose, respectively. These ciprofloxacin concentrations were similar to other published body fluid concentrations following a single oral 500-mg dose.\r"

We report a case of a nursing-home patient with dementia and Parkinson's disease who required aerosolized corticosteroids to avoid repeated systemic corticosteroid courses for asthmatic exacerbations. The patient was unable to use a triamcinolone metered-dose inhaler with spacer devices because of his impairments. Therefore, nebulized dexamethasone solution was prepared and administered. Since initiation of nebulized dexamethasone, the patient has not required systemic corticosteroids. In addition, his hypopituitary adrenal axis has remained intact as evidenced by provocative cosyntropin testing. Therefore, nebulized dexamethasone solution may be an alternative to the aerosol corticosteroid metered-dose inhaler when patients are too impaired to use inhalers, even with spacers.\r"

A one-year postgraduate, long-distance program leading to a diploma in clinical pharmacy was started in October 1987 in cooperation with Queen's University of Belfast, Ireland. Pharmacist and physician tutors were assigned to supervise students in the major hospitals in Kuwait. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 50 practicing pharmacists to assess the feasibility of using the Drug Information Center at Adan Hospital (DICAH) as a base for continuing education programs. Although certain difficulties were identified, it was concluded that the DICAH has the potential to be used as a base for future continuing education for pharmacists in Kuwait, especially as there is no school of pharmacy in the country.\r"

Mean-height Z score was depressed, whereas mean-weight Z score was closer to normal and mean-weight/height Z score was normal in patients with extrahepatic biliary atresia, idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, and other liver disorders. Patients with arteriohepatic dysplasia showed more severe depression of all three variables. In all patients, triceps skinfold (TSF) thickness Z scores were significantly more depressed than were weight/height Z scores. Depressions of midarm-circumference and midarm-muscle-area Z scores were intermediate. Mean-head-circumference Z score was depressed in children aged less than 24 mo. We conclude that acute (wasting) and chronic (stunting) malnutrition are common in childhood CLD and that weight/height values underestimate the degree of acute malnutrition compared with TSF thickness, most likely because of the inflated patient weight caused by organomegaly.\r"

This report evaluates the potential of DPA to isolate appendages of human subjects and to quantify extremity skeletal muscle mass (limb fat-free soft tissue). The method was evaluated in 34 healthy adults who underwent DPA study, anthropometry of the limbs, and estimation of whole-body skeletal muscle by models based on total body potassium (TBK) and nitrogen (TBN) and on fat-free body mass (FFM). DPA appendicular skeletal muscle (22.0 +/- 3.1 kg, mean +/- SD) represented 38.7% of FFM, with similar proportions in males and females. There were strong correlations (all p less than 0.001) between limb muscle mass estimated by DPA and anthropometric limb muscle areas (r = 0.82-0.92), TBK (r = 0.94), and total-body muscle mass based on TBK-FFM (r = 0.82) and TBK-TBN (r = 0.82) models. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass estimated by DPA is thus a potentially practical and accurate method of quantifying human skeletal muscle mass in vivo.\r"

Energy expenditure was significantly increased above baseline resting metabolic rate (RMR) over the 2 h by nicotine alone (6.5% of RMR, p less than 0.01). However, the combined effect of nicotine after calorie load (20.1% of RMR, p less than 0.001) was not significantly greater than the effect of calorie load alone (18.4% of RMR, p less than 0.001).

Heart rate and energy expenditure were increased in proportion to the exercise by the same amount in both groups.

Univariate and multivariate prediction of meal size and of postmeal interval were also calculated to ascertain alcohol's contribution to the regulation. The results suggest that alcohol supplements rather than displaces macronutrient-supplied calories, that alcohol is associated with prolonged meal durations, and that alcohol calories may be unregulated. Other apparent changes in the meal pattern appear to be artifacts of time of day and meal duration.\r"

During underfeeding, patients received iopanoic acid or placebo for 2-wk periods in a double-blind crossover fashion. Underfeeding alone (UF) produced a 28.3% decline in the serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentration, and iopanoic acid plus underfeeding (IOP) produced a 49.5% decline in T3 concentration from baseline. Serum reverse T3 concentrations increased 289% during IOP compared with UF alone (p less than 0.001). Serum TSH concentration was unchanged by underfeeding but increased twofold during IOP treatment. Thyroid hormone kinetics demonstrated a decrease in T3 production during IOP compared with UF. These findings suggest that calorie restriction regulates T3 production by modulating only type I 5'-deiodinase activity.\r"

The maternal and fetal responses to the energetic stresses of overlap and of the duration of the recuperative (nonpregnant, nonlactating) interval were assessed. Overlap resulted in increased supplement intake. Short recuperative periods (less than 6 mo) resulted in increased supplement intake and reduced maternal fat stores. The energetic stresses of overlap and short recuperative periods did not significantly affect fetal growth. The mother appears to buffer the energetic stress, protecting fetal growth. This research demonstrates that evidence of depletion of maternal nutrient stores caused by a demanding reproductive history is found when reproductive stress is characterized adequately.\r"

We examined the effect of these two diets on HDL1 and HDL2 apolipoprotein and cholesterol uptake by adipocytes isolated from perirenal and epididymal adipose tissue of male Wistar rats. Consistent with selective cellular uptake. HDL esterified cholesterol uptake was 3-10-fold higher than predicted from HDL apolipoproteins associated with adipocytes. Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly enhanced apolipoprotein and esterified-cholesterol uptakes from HDL2 by perirenal adipocytes. This effect of dietary fat composition was adipose-region (perirenal greater than epididymal) and HDL-subfraction (HDL2 greater than HDL1) specific. Thus, diet-induced changes known to alter membrane phospholipid composition and increase HDL2 binding are also associated with enhanced HDL2-esterified-cholesterol uptake by adipocytes.\r"

Plasma fibrinogen was reduced by 13% and serum triglycerides by 22% after fish-oil supplementation ended. Three weeks after supplementation ended both variables were back to baseline values. An appreciable increase in the ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid (EPA:AA) in plasma eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid (EPA:AA) in plasma and red blood cell phospholipids occurred during the fish-oil intake. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and HDL2 activity tended to be lowered by fish-oil supplementation. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, serum cholesterol, gamma-glutamyltransferase, blood glucose, and monocyte low-density-lipoprotein receptor activity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The reduction in plasma fibrinogen concentration seems of special interest because this variable in several recent studies emerges as a separate cardiovascular risk factor with a high predictive value.\r"

No statistically significant (p greater than 0.2) changes were observed for proline oxidation, endogenous biosynthesis, or flux. The data suggest that the absence of proline in the human diet does not trigger changes in proline dynamics during the postabsorptive state. The metabolic significance of the reduction of plasma proline concentrations requires elucidation.\r"

Four adult rhesus monkeys with chronically implanted intragastric cannulas were trained to use suction-activated food pumps that were monitored by computer so feeding pattern could be assessed over periods averaging 4 wk each. Each suck delivered the oral control diet while simultaneously activating a second pump, which delivered a second diet directly into the stomach, resulting in net diet compositions of either 14% or 50% protein. The calorie intake was consistently reduced by 24.7 +/- 1.6% when the high-protein diet was fed. The effect on intake was not due to increased diet osmolality. A doubling in plasma branched-chain amino acid concentration occurred when the high-protein diet was fed. These data indicate that feeding a high-protein diet results in a physiological appetite suppression, possibly mediated through branched-chain amino acids.\r"

Incorporation of MC-SAFAs in PLs occurred at the expense of LC-SAFAs, MUFAs, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and long-chain PUFAs with greater than or equal to 20 carbon atoms (LC-PUFAs greater than or equal to C20). Previous studies from Western countries revealed low amounts of MCSAFAs and high amounts of PUFAs and LC-PUFAs greater than or equal to C20 in milk PLs. Our data show that carbohydrate-rich diets give rise to incorporation of MC-SAFAs in PLs at the expense of PUFAs and LC-PUFAs greater than or equal to C20.

Vitamin E-deficient patients performed less well than did healthy control subjects on six of eight neuropsychologic tests of psychomotor capacity (p less than 0.01). Vitamin E-sufficient patients did not differ significantly from normal control subjects. Serum vitamin E concentrations were significantly lower in the group classified as significantly psychomotor-impaired by two independent neuropsychologists (blind to vitamin E status) whereas liver-injury measures failed to distinguish between these two groups. Patients with low serum vitamin E exhibited clinically evident neurologic abnormalities.

Intracaliper reliability was similar. Mean absolute differences between repeated measurements ranged from 0.17 to 0.25 cm, technical errors of the estimate ranged from 0.16 to 0.26 cm, and coefficients of reliability exceeded 0.99 for each model. Equations based on knee height predicted subjects' stature to +/- 2.3 cm, an amount unlikely to substantially impair height-based nutrition indices. This comparatively inexpensive caliper was as accurate and reliable as more expensive commercially available models and may be recommended as an alternative to the other calipers.\r"

  ".U": "90328143\r", 
  ".W": "We studied serum immunoglobulins in 54 patients with chronic viral hepatitis. The majority had hyperglobulinemia, with immunoglobulin G (IgG) being elevated the most. High resolution protein electrophoresis revealed the presence of oligoclonal bands within the gamma-globulin region of the electrophoretic pattern (oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands) in 32 (59%) patients. Between two and seven bands were noted in each sample. In order to analyze the significance of this observation, we performed stepwise discriminant analysis of clinical, demographic, serological, and serum biochemical features in patients with and without detectable oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands. The patient's ages and serum immunoglobulin G levels were found to be important predictors of the presence of oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands. No correlation was found with the type of hepatitis, disease severity, or duration of hepatitis. On follow-up, serum samples were retested in 20 patients, over 5 to 60 months. Significant change was noted in only one patient in whom oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands (initially very prominent) became progressively weaker and finally disappeared over a 5-yr period. This was associated with an improvement in his hepatitis after loss of hepatitis following loss of hepatitis B e antigen from serum. These observations suggest that the determination of oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands in serum may be a useful marker to study the course and activity of chronic viral hepatitis in selected patients.\r"

The histologic findings in liver biopsy specimens characteristic of allograft rejection were observed prior to and during the initial phase of antirejection therapy. However, failure of a complete response to antirejection therapy promoted rebiopsy. The specimen showed portal infiltrates composed predominantly of plasma cells and immunoblasts. The presumptive diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis was confirmed by staining frozen liver tissue for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear-associated antigen. OKT-3 therapy was discontinued, and cyclosporine and steroid doses were reduced. Gradually, clinical features, serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, and the portal lymphoid infiltrate resolved. Epstein-Barr virus serology showed an increase in convalescent titers IgG-antiviral capsid antigen, and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear-associated antigen. The histologic, clinical, and laboratory features supporting the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis in a liver transplant patient are presented and discussed. This diagnosis guided appropriate therapy.\r"

The normal esophageal response to intraesophageal balloon distention is to generate a sustained contraction proximal to the balloon while showing a distinctive absence of activity distal to the balloon. We evaluated intraesophageal balloon distention in 62 patients with noncardiac chest pain and compared the diagnostic results to those obtained by using a combination of acid infusion, edrophonium (80 micrograms/kg iv) and bethanechol (80 micrograms/kg sq). These 62 patients were also compared with 10 normal volunteers who underwent intraesophageal balloon distention. Abnormal distal manometric activity consistent with spasm and was seen in 38/62 (61%) patients. Distal manometric activity was not seen in any normal volunteer. Diagnostic results (symptom reproduction with manometric changes but without EKG changes) were seen in 26/62 (42%) patients, but in nine of the 62 (14%) patients with combined drug provocation (p less than 0.05). Intraesophageal balloon distention is superior to a combination of provocative drugs in evaluating noncardiac chest pain symptoms. The presence of abnormal manometric activity distal to the balloon may represent regulation of esophageal motility.\r"

  ".W": "A causative role is now accepted for Helicobacter (formerly Campylobacter) pylori in type B gastritis, and evidence is accumulating that H. pylori infection plays a major contributory role in duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, and epidemic gastric cancer. The prevalence of H. pylori in any population remains unknown. We compared the prevalence of H. pylori infection in the Riyadh region of Saudia Arabia, using a specific and sensitive ELISA for IgG antibody against the high molecular weight cell-associated antigen of H. pylori (urease). Subjects were interviewed, demographic data were collected, and a serum sample was obtained. Subjects completed a questionnaire that included questions about level of education, smoking, medications used, presence and frequency of symptoms referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract, and family history of ulcer disease. We studied 557 individuals (ranging in age from 5 to 91 yr). The prevalence of H. pylori infection increased rapidly with age: from 40% of those ages 5-10 yr, to more than 70% of those 20 or older. H. pylori infection occurred with significantly more frequency in adults with less than 12 yr of schooling, compared with adults who had attended college. The high rate of acquisition of H. pylori infection in Saudia Arabia emphasizes that studies of H. pylori-disease associations must consider the baseline prevalence of H. pylori infection in that population.\r"

Duodenal ulcer patients were given H2-antagonists (either cimetidine or famotidine) for 4 wk of therapy. Fifty-two (77.6%) of the 67 patients were healed endoscopically. The histological state of the regenerating mucosa of healed duodenal ulcer was divided into three categories: good, fair, and poor patterns. Of the 52 healed patients, 15 achieved a good histological pattern. None of these 15 patients had a recurrence 3 months later. However, nine of the 37 patients with a fair or poor pattern of regenerating mucosa had a recurrence 3 months after healing (p = 0.034). We concluded that a duodenal ulcer should be treated until the regenerating mucosa of the healed ulcer reaches a good histological pattern, so as to prevent the recurrence of the ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "An individual's simultaneous nonmalignant gastroduodenal polyps were profoundly spatially clustered in a combined endoscopic and radiographic study of 41 consecutive patients. With endoscopic polyp localization, clustering was demonstrated using a nonparametric test of clustering (Kruskal-Wallis statistic with 40 degrees of freedom = 113.35, probability of observing this extreme statistic with no clustering less than 0.0005) and a parametric test of clustering (F test statistic with 40 and 104 degrees of freedom = 17.05, probability of observing this extreme statistic with no clustering less than 0.0005). In the 26 patients with radiographic polyp localization, polyp clustering was confirmed with the same statistical techniques (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis statistic with 25 degrees of freedom = 88.2, probability of observing this extreme statistic with no clustering less than 0.0005). In patients whose largest polyp was in any given region, there was an increased likelihood that their other polyps would be in that same region. For example, at endoscopy, the nine patients whose largest polyp was in the duodenal bulb had 13 of 15, or 87% +/- 9% (SE), of their other polyps in the duodenal bulb. In contrast, the 11 patients who, at endoscopy, had their largest polyp in the proximal stomach had 2 of 30, or 7% +/- 5% (SE), of their other polyps in the duodenal bulb. Polyp clustering was not dependent on the number of gastroduodenal polyps, or patient age or sex. Patients with at least one hyperplastic polyp, one adenomatous polyp, or with both types of polyps also exhibited profound polyp clustering. These findings suggest that local factors may be important in the pathogenesis of multiple polyps of the stomach and duodenal bulb. In particular, these findings suggest a possibly closer relationship between hyperplastic and adenomatous gastroduodenal polyps than previously appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "We used an endoscopic method of quantification to evaluate the response of symptomatic gastrointestinal Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) prospectively in seven patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who were participating in chemotherapy trials for extensive cutaneous KS. The sums of the diameters of KS lesions in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and distal colon were used as a measure of extent of disease. Intravenous therapy [adriamycin/bleomycin/vincristine (N = 5), adriamycin (N = 1), or bleomycin/vincristine (N = 1)] was given every 2 wk for a mean of six cycles. Five of seven patients (71%) had a cutaneous response, whereas 9/15 (60%) gastrointestinal sites showed a remission. Sites of complete response all had an initial sum of lesion diameters less than or equal to 30 mm. Five of five patients with duodenal KS responded (3/5 complete), whereas just two partial responses were seen in five patients with gastric KS (4/5 with duodenal KS had sums of diameters less than or equal to 20 mm, whereas 4/5 with gastric KS had sums greater than or equal to 150 mm). Symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, hematemesis, diarrhea) resolved in all patients within two cycles of therapy. In summary: 1) the response rate of gastrointestinal KS to chemotherapy is similar to that of cutaneous KS; 2) the best response is seen in patients with less extensive disease and duodenal involvement; and 3) symptoms of gastrointestinal KS respond to chemotherapy even if the KS lesions do not resolve.\r"

Psoriasis is more common in patients with Crohn's disease and their first-degree relatives than in controls, suggesting the possibility of a genetic link.

The patients were divided into three groups: group A (n = 10) had no diabetic neuropathy, group B (n = 8) had diabetic neuropathy with little autonomic neuropathy, and group C (n = 10) had advanced diabetic autonomic neuropathy. In groups A and B, contraction of the gallbladder after egg yolk administration was not significantly different from that of normal subjects. However, in group C, gallbladder contraction was impaired (p less than 0.01-0.05), compared with that in normal subjects. After the administration of egg yolk, plasma CCK levels increased from 12.4 +/- 4.5 to 25.3 +/- 12.0 pg/ml in normal subjects. In group A, plasma CCK levels increased from 17.9 +/- 8.5 to 39.3 +/- 14.2 pg/ml, and in group B, from 15.2 +/- 5.1 to 38.3 +/- 9.9 pg/ml. In group C, however, plasma CCK levels increased from 33.1 +/- 13.9 to 72.4 +/- 31.9 pg/ml, and fasting CCK levels and responses to egg yolk were significantly higher than those in normal subjects and in groups A and B (p less than 0.01-0.05). In conclusion, this study showed that in a group of diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy, gallbladder contraction was impaired despite the exaggerated CCK response to egg yolk.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with chronic right upper quadrant pain who do not have gallstones on ultrasound or cholecystography are often referred for surgery for presumed acalculous chronic cholecystitis. We followed 26 patients who had cholecystokinin (CCK) cholescintigraphy for evaluation of chronic right upper quadrant pain without demonstrable gallstones on ultrasound who underwent cholecystectomy so that it could be determined whether there was any relation between a low ejection fraction (EF), morphological features of chronic cholecystitis, and clinical outcome. Eighteen patients (69%) were considered therapeutic successes, whereas eight (31%) were failures after an average 2-yr follow-up. Both patient groups had significantly reduced EF: the successful group at 0.39 and the failures at 0.25. Thus, a low EF did not predict clinical outcome, since the failure group had an even lower EF than the success group. Seven gallbladders demonstrated chronic acalculous cholecystitis; the average EF of this group was 0.35. The remaining 19 gallbladders were normal, yet also had an EF of 0.35. Thus, decreased EF does not predict the histologic features of chronic cholecystitis without gallstones. The diagnostic value of cholescintigraphy in patients with acalculous right upper quadrant pain is low, probably because this entity represents a variety of processes, including inflammation, gallbladder dysmotility, and the irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

Bleeding precluded stone extraction in three patients, and these stones were removed at a second ERCP session.

All of the IAC patients presented with obstructive jaundice. Twenty-three of the 31 NIAC patients developed abdominal pain and/or fever caused by cholangitis or pancreatitis, and the remaining eight patients were asymptomatic. The two groups were not significantly different in age, sex, size of the tumor, macroscopic type, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion, lymphatic permeation, and venous invasion. Eighteen of the 31 NIACs (58%) were in stages I and II, whereas 25 of the 111 IACs (22%) were in stages I and II (p less than 0.01). Seventeen of the 31 NIACs (55%) were papillary adenocarcinoma, compared with 39 of 111 IACs (35%) (p less than 0.05). As to involvement of the biliary tract, the NIAC showed an intraluminal papillary growth in 14 cases (45%), whereas the IAC showed a periductal invasion in 58 cases (52%) (p less than 0.05). The cumulative 5-yr and 10-yr survival rates of 31 patients with NIAC were 57% and 57%, compared with 32% and 23% of 105 patients with IAC (p less than 0.05; p less than 0.01). The survival curve of the NIAC was significantly better than that of the IAC (p less than 0.01). Non-icteric presentation had no independent prognostic value, as determined by multivariate regression analysis. The NIAC fares better than the IAC, because the NIAC includes a greater number of early ampullary carcinoma and papillary adenocarcinoma. The detection of NIAC may therefore product an improvement in the clinical course of ampullary carcinoma.\r"

Multiple logistic regression was used to control for intercorrelation between potential risk factors. Factors associated with increased risk for third- and fourth-degree lacerations were midline episiotomy, nulliparity, second-stage arrest, occipitoposterior position, low or mid station, use of forceps instead of vacuum, use of local anesthesia, and Asian race. When these factors were controlled, there was no effect of birth weight, faculty versus resident operator, gestational age, abnormalities of first-stage labor, or several other factors. Prevention of perineal lacerations requires that the operator identify the patient at risk. Possible options for management of high-risk patients include use of mediolateral episiotomy or no episiotomy, use of vacuum extraction instead of forceps, and use of conduction anesthesia.\r"

Terminal acute-on-chronic fetal asphyxia can be excluded by a two-tier method of fetal assessment by initial nonstress test backed up by the biophysical profile score when the nonstress test is suboptimal.\r"

The calcium fractions in the plasma were calculated from the total calcium, albumin, globulin, anion gap, and bicarbonate concentrations. With a level of follicle-stimulating hormone within the reference range (up to 20 U/L) to define the premenopausal state, we confirmed previously reported menopausal rises in plasma calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and bicarbonate, and in urinary calcium and hydroxyproline. However, inspection of the data, and t testing at different follicle-stimulating hormone criteria showed that these changes in bone-related variables did not generally occur until the level of follicle-stimulating hormone exceeded approximately 50 U/L. The plasma alkaline phosphatase level rose earlier than the other variables and was significantly elevated in subjects with follicle-stimulating hormone values above 30 U/L. The rise in plasma calcium was mainly a result of a rise in the ultrafiltrable fraction, which in turn was accounted for by rises in the ionized and complexed fractions, of which the complexed fraction was the most significant and proportionately the largest. The rise in the complexed fraction was accounted for by the increase in plasma bicarbonate.\r"

Cases of intrauterine growth retardation (N = 3450) (greater than or equal to 37 weeks, less than 10th percentile birth weight for gestational age) were classified by their ponderal index (weight/length3) in four subgroups using the 10th, 25th, and 90th percentiles of the Lubchenco's ponderal index-gestational age distribution. There were 432 cases (12.5%) with low ponderal index or disproportionate intrauterine growth retardation, 936 (27.1%) with intermediate ponderal index, 2030 (58.8%) with adequate ponderal index or proportionate intrauterine growth retardation, and 52 (1.5%) with high ponderal index. The low ponderal index group or disproportionate intrauterine growth retardation group had a statistically significant higher risk (between 1.6 and 12.5 times) for low 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, aspiration syndrome, hypoglycemia, and perinatal asphyxia than the adequate ponderal index group. The low ponderal index group also had an increased risk (relative risk = 2.0 [95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.8]) for hospital stay of more than 1 week. These differences persist after a stratified analysis by birth weight and in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Similarly, higher neonatal morbidity is observed among infants with normal birth weights but with low ponderal index. These data provide further evidence of the heterogeneity of the intrauterine growth retardation syndrome and of the independent effect of body disproportion on neonatal morbidity, even among infants with normal birth weights. Because there are significant clinical implications attributed to the low ponderal index group, this subgroup should be identified as early as possible.\r"

Correlation between foot length and menstrual dates was weak in trisomy 18. Gestational age predicted by crown-rump length was significantly lower than gestational age by menstrual dates. All long bones were significantly shortened and fell below normal regression lines for gestational age. The fetal femur/foot length ratio was reduced. Thus no endogenous measure of gestational age appears to exist in this aneuploidy, forcing reliance on menstrual dates. The observed pattern of growth alterations will likely preclude the development of a gestational age-dependent biometric screen for the prenatal detection of this syndrome.\r"

There was an excess of human leukocyte antigen sharing in both types of recurrent aborters. The primary aborters shared human leukocyte A and DQ antigens and three or more of the human leukocyte A, B, DR, and DQ antigens. The secondary aborters did not have an excess of sharing at any one locus but they did share three or more of the human leukocyte A, B, DR, and DQ antigens. There was no excess of antipaternal cytotoxic antibodies in any group of aborters, and the primary aborters had a lower level of mixed lymphocyte reaction blocking factor than normal couples or secondary aborters. Previous studies showed that couples in whom a gestational trophoblastic tumor developed in the woman shared human leukocyte B and DQ antigens and three or more of the human leukocyte A, B, DR, and DQ antigens. These studies provide substantial support for the role of recessive genes linked to the major histocompatibility complex in the pathogenesis of recurrent spontaneous abortions and of gestational trophoblastic tumors.\r"

We also investigated the influence of these conditions on the response of the uterus to histamine. The results show the same qualitative cyclic changes of the spontaneous motility of isolated myometrial strips throughout the menstrual cycle in all the abnormalities studied. These changes are characterized by a low amplitude and high frequency of spontaneous contractions in the proliferative phase and lower frequency with higher amplitude of contractions in the secretory phase. The isolated strips from patients with myomas present the highest spontaneous activity in reproductive age and preclimacteric women, but not in menopausal women. Histamine produced concentration-related contractions that are not significantly different in all the myometrial strips studied.\r"

In the rat the oxytocin antagonist: (1) inhibited in vitro and in vivo uterine contractions in the nonpregnant animal in response to exogenous oxytocin, (2) inhibited milk letdown, and (3) disrupted the progress of labor. In addition, the oxytocin antagonist inhibited the in vitro contractile response to exogenous oxytocin of human myometrial tissue obtained by cesarean section at term. The results of these studies suggest that the oxytocin antagonist can be used to study the role of oxytocin in labor and has the potential of inhibiting preterm labor in humans.\r"

Increasing doses of d-tubocurarine selectively blocked various muscle groups, with the extraocular muscles being the most sensitive. Comparison of the median effective dose for neuromuscular blockade of the extraocular muscles/nuchal muscle/diaphragm was 1:2.5:6. The duration of action of d-tubocurarine was directly related to the relative sensitivities of the different muscle groups, which are ranked from most sensitive to least sensitive as extraocular muscles, nuchal muscle, and diaphragm. Fetal electrocorticogram continued to cycle despite total neuromuscular blockade. However, there was an increase in synchronized and mixed activity, which was predominantly due to an increase in cycle numbers, and a decrease in desynchronized activity, which was predominantly due to shorter cycle lengths. During total neuromuscular blockade, there was also a significant decrease in heart rate during synchronized and mixed electrocorticogram states but not during a desynchronized electrocorticogram state, thus resulting in a loss of the heart rate difference normally seen between synchronized and desynchronized states. Fetal blood pressure did not change with total neuromuscular blockade.\r"

The in vitro fertilization rate of mouse ova decreased from 77.0% (control) to 50.0%, 28.7%, and 7.5% in the presence of RU 486 concentrations at 5, 10, and 20 micrograms/ml medium, respectively (p less than 0.001). A concentration of 1 microgram/ml did not affect the fertilization rate. A progesterone concentration at equal to or double the concentration RU 486 did not reverse the inhibitory effect of RU 486 on in vitro fertilization, which suggests a progesterone-independent mechanism. Exposure of spermatozoa (for 90 minutes) or ova (for 60 minutes) to RU 486 (20 micrograms/ml) followed by washing with RU 486-free medium before coincubation did not affect the fertilization rate. The presence or absence of cumulus cells did not change the inhibitory effect of RU 486 (20 micrograms/ml) on in vitro fertilization. RU 486 at 5 to 20 micrograms/ml medium was associated with perivitelline polyspermy in nonfertilized ova and enhanced perivitelline polyspermy in fertilized ova.\r"

In tissues from pregnant rats, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine were less sensitive than in rings from nonpregnant animals; maximum responses were not affected. The effect of isoproterenol was not modified in tissues from pregnant rats. The presence of endothelium in tissue rings was evaluated as fractional relaxation to acetylcholine. Sensitivity to phenylephrine and norepinephrine was inversely related to the effect of acetylcholine. This relationship was similar in slope in both groups but different in intercept. The sensitivity to isoproterenol was directly related to the presence of endothelium (curves similar in both slope and intercept). This demonstrates that the responses of mesenteric artery rings depends on the presence of endothelium. Furthermore, vascular endothelium is not involved in the blunted responses to adrenergic vasoconstrictor during pregnancy.\r"

The collagenous fibers of the amnion were found to be closely packed with no ground substances and formed in a thick layer.

This study was designed to confirm or refute the theoretical concern that intrauterine insemination may induce antisperm antibodies in such women. Serum and cervical mucus were obtained at the first, fourth, and sixth intrauterine inseminations. The serum was screened by the Immunobead test for IgG and IgA. If screening results were positive (greater than 10% binding), antisperm antibodies were titered by the microimmobilization and microagglutination tests. The Immunobead test was performed on the cervical mucus after liquefication with bromelin. Ninety-three patients were followed up prospectively. Of these, 40 completed six intrauterine insemination cycles and the remaining 53 completed four cycles. Low transient antisperm antibody levels were detected in 10.8% of the patients and would not be expected to affect the prognosis for fertility. It is concluded that intrauterine insemination does not induce significant antisperm antibody production in women.\r"

  ".W": "The multidrug-resistance gene, MDR1, encodes a plasma membrane glycoprotein termed P-glycoprotein that mediates active cellular efflux of certain chemotherapeutic agents. P-Glycoprotein expression was evaluated in 98 frozen tumor specimens from 57 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique with monoclonal antibodies C219 and JSB-1 used for detection. Tumor specimens were further characterized antigenically with a panel of monoclonal antibodies representing a variety of epithelial cell antigens. Included were 57 specimens from 33 previously untreated patients; 11 specimens were also available from eight patients in this group after chemotherapy. An additional 30 specimens were studied from 24 other patients after chemotherapy. In only four of the 57 patients with ovarian cancer (7%) did one or more of the specimens express P-glycoprotein. Two of these patients had tumors that were considered clinically drug resistant. No increase in P-glycoprotein expression was noted after exposure to chemotherapy, including the eight individuals for whom specimens were available both before and after treatment. Although drug resistance is a major problem in treatment of ovarian cancer, resistance to the drugs most active against these tumors probably occurs through a mechanism other than expression of the MDR1 gene product.\r"

This study was designed to assess whether contaminated fetal blood samples could be discriminated from noncontaminated ones by the ferning test, and if so what is the minimum dilution ratio of amniotic fluid/fetal blood that is detectable. Fetal blood samples were diluted with amniotic fluid and were tested for ferning under the microscope after the plasma was separated from the cells. At a dilution ratio of 0.2 ml of amniotic fluid to 1 ml of fetal blood, 30% of the samples tested positive for ferning. A rate of 100% detection of ferning was achieved at a dilution ratio of 0.6:1. In conclusion, screening fetal blood samples for ferning can detect amniotic fluid contamination. The sensitivity of the test for ferning depends on the dilution ratio. The test cannot assess how much amniotic fluid was added to the blood sample.\r"

The glycosylated and nonglycosylated prolactin bands were exposed by autoradiography. The bands were analyzed by densitometry, and the ratio of glycosylated to total (glycosylated + nonglycosylated) prolactin was calculated (glycosylated/total ratio) and compared with matched prolactin radioimmunoassay measurements. Both radioimmunoassay-measured and nonglycosylated prolactin decreased from the second to the third trimester whereas glycosylated prolactin concentrations remained unchanged. Concomitantly, glycosylated/total prolactin ratios increased significantly (p less than 0.001). The correlation of radioimmunoassay-measured prolactin was closer to nonglycosylated prolactin (r2 = 0.32, p = 0.00001) than to glycosylated prolactin (r2 = 0.02, p = 0.06). We suggest that the proportion of amniotic fluid glycosylated prolactin increases with length of gestation and that glycosylation of prolactin is inversely related to total prolactin secretion. Furthermore, prolactin's immunoreactivity correlated more closely to the nonglycosylated-prolactin variant, suggesting that radioimmunoassay of prolactin poorly recognizes the glycosylated prolactin form.\r"

In this study we examined 3366 Hispanic, Chinese, black, and non-Hispanic white women in a universal screening program for gestational diabetes mellitus. After maternal age and body mass index were controlled, Chinese women had a significantly higher serum glucose level 1 hour after 50 gm of oral glucose (134.8 +/- 1.2, mean +/- SE) than any of the remaining three groups. Black women had a significantly lower value (113.3 +/- 1.3, mean +/- SE) than either Chinese or Hispanic women (124.4 +/- 0.9, mean +/- SE). Results for Hispanic women and non-Hispanic white women (121.4 +/- 1.6, mean +/- SE) were not different. The screening glucose levels of Chinese women were substantially higher than other ethnic groups even when women with gestational diabetes were removed from the analysis, indicating that the observed differences were not solely due to a higher frequency of gestational diabetes among the Chinese. The incidence of gestational diabetes was significantly greater for Chinese (7.3%) and Hispanic (4.2%) women than for black (1.7%) and non-Hispanic white (1.6%) women. Among women who had a 3-hour glucose tolerance test, the area under the glucose curve was significantly associated with maternal age and body mass index. The demonstrated heterogeneity of glucose tolerance between ethnic groups may be of importance in determining the threshold for diabetic fetopathy, and it is possible that ethnicity-specific standards will need to be developed.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the prevalence of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism in the early postpartum period in women with gestational diabetes mellitus, we performed 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests between 5 and 8 weeks post partum in 246 women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus. Patients were stratified into three study groups based on their fasting serum glucose level during pregnancy: (1) group A1: all fasting serum glucose levels during pregnancy less than 105 mg/dl without insulin therapy; (2) group A2: any fasting serum glucose levels greater than 105 and less than 140 mg/dl before insulin therapy; (3) group B1: any pregnancy with fasting serum glucose levels greater than 140 mg/dl. Overall, 48 (19%) of the patients had an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test in the early postpartum period; 25 (10%) had impaired glucose tolerance and 23 (9%) had diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of postpartum diabetes mellitus (2% in group A1, 9% in group A2 and 44% in group B1) increased in parallel with the degree of maternal metabolic decompensation during pregnancy (p less than 0.05 for A1 versus A2; p less than 0.001 for A2 versus B1). The prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance was likewise greater in the B1 group (26%) than in either the A1 or the A2 group (p less than 0.05). Gestational age less than 24 weeks at diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus was an additional risk factor for postpartum glucose intolerance. Our findings support the use of an oral glucose tolerance test in the early puerperium, especially for patients with elevated fasting serum glucose levels during pregnancy.\r"

Three-quarters were discharged to community settings. Half of the patients were never rehospitalized, but many others continued to display patterns of recidivism. On the assumption that socially dysfunctional behavior would improve after discharge, the funded community system emphasized assessments, residential placements, and crisis intervention and deemphasized treatment. The findings raise many questions about the efficacy and wisdom of attempting to serve an entire state hospital population in the community.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one infants and small children (14.7 +/- 7.2 mo) were studied to determine the MAC of halothane in O2 (n = 11) and in the presence of three different nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations (25% [n = 13], 50% [n = 13], and 75% [n = 14]). In the three N2O groups, after randomly assigning patients to an N2O group, anesthesia was induced with halothane and N2O using a pediatric circle system. After endotracheal intubation, halothane and N2O end-expired concentrations were adjusted to predetermined concentrations. The initial halothane concentrations in each group were based on the assumption that each percent N2O reduced halothane concentrations by 0.01 vol % (assumed halothane MAC = 1.0 vol %). Based on the response of the preceding subject in each group, halothane concentrations were increased or decreased depending on whether the response was to move or not to move, respectively, in response to the surgical incision. The mean duration of constant end-tidal concentrations before skin incision was 10 min. End-tidal gases were sampled and measured from a separate distal sampling port of an endotracheal tube during controlled ventilation (Perkin-Elmer Mass Spectrometer). The MAC value for halothane in O2 was 0.94 +/- 0.08 vol % (mean +/- SD). The MAC values of halothane in the presence of 25%, 50%, and 75% N2O were 0.78 +/- 0.12 vol %, 0.44 +/- 0.10 vol %, and 0.29 +/- 0.06 vol %, respectively. All concentrations of N2O significantly reduced the MAC of halothane. A regression analysis through all four data points yielded a linear relationship (r2 = 0.87) with a predicted MAC for N2O of 105 vol %. Unlike halothane and isoflurane, the predicted MAC of N2O in infants and children is similar to that reported by others in adults. Similar to the results of clinical studies in adults, the contribution of N2O to halothane MAC in children is additive.\r"

Two series of experiments (sedative and hypnotic) were performed. In the sedative series, doses that inhibited locomotor activity to 10% or more of the control level were determined when the agents were given singly or in combination. Dose-response curves were determined with a probit procedure. The ED50 values of both agents and their combination were compared with algebraic (fractional) and isobolographic analyses in one subseries of experiments. The effect of a small fixed dose of morphine (1/10 of ED50 value for the sedative effect) on the slope of the sedative dose-response curve for midazolam was determined in the other subseries. In the hypnotic series of experiments, doses (ED50) that blocked the righting reflex with drugs given separately and in combination were determined by a probit procedure and, as in the sedative series, compared with algebraic (fractional) and isobolographic analyses. Sedative interaction between midazolam and morphine was found to have a tendency for synergism (interaction coefficient of 1.56, P greater than 0.05) with decreased individual variability in the sedative response to the combination. Hypnotic midazolam-morphine interaction was highly synergistic with the interaction coefficient of 3.70 (P less than 0.0001). A difference in the outcomes of midazolam-morphine interaction regarding sedation and hypnosis suggests that underlying mechanisms for these two effects are different; therefore, they should not be regarded as only increasing depths of the same action.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the cardiovascular actions of drugs commonly combined with inhalation anesthetics, we administered one drug from each of several classes of adjuvants to seven swine already anesthetized with equipotent concentrations (1.2 MAC) of desflurane, formerly I-653, a new inhaled anesthetic, or isoflurane. Succinylcholine (1 and 2 mg/kg), atracurium (0.6 mg/kg), and atropine (5 micrograms/kg) plus edrophonium (5 mg/kg) had no cardiovascular effects. Fentanyl was given in amounts that decreased MAC for the inhaled anesthetics by 25%-35%. A dose of 50 micrograms/kg IV had no cardiovascular effects during either anesthetic, whereas 100 micrograms/kg IV modestly increased systemic vascular resistance without changing other variables. Naloxone (100 micrograms/kg IV) during infusion of fentanyl decreased systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output during both desflurane and isoflurane anesthesia, increased heart rate during only isoflurane anesthesia, and did not affect mean arterial blood pressure during either anesthetic. Thiopental (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg IV) decreased mean aortic blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance during both anesthetics without altering heart rate or left- or right-sided cardiac filling pressures. The addition of 60% nitrous oxide caused no cardiovascular changes during desflurane anesthesia, but increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output and stroke volume during isoflurane without altering heart rate or cardiac preload. We conclude that the usual clinical doses of adjuvants commonly administered during anesthesia have no untoward cardiovascular actions during 1.2 MAC desflurane or isoflurane anesthesia in swine.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action of local anesthetics on synaptic transmission and their effects on synaptic components and on electrophysiologic properties of the nerve cell body are not clear. Therefore, the effects of lidocaine and bupivacaine on pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia were studied utilizing the techniques of intracellular recording and stimulation on isolated superfused superior cervical ganglia of rats. Lidocaine and bupivacaine either depressed or completely blocked synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia in a dose-dependent manner. Blockade of axonal conduction in presynaptic fibers was preceded by increased latency (the latency increased from 11.2 +/- 0.9 to 16.5 +/- 1.4 ms, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01) when the drugs were applied to the presynaptic nerves. Application of the drugs directly to the ganglion produced alterations in postsynaptic membrane properties consisting of decreased membrane resistance (from 40 +/- 3 to 32 +/- 3 M omega, P less than 0.01), increased firing threshold (from 14 +/- 0.5 to 18 +/- 0.5 mV, P less than 0.01), and decreased action potential amplitude (P less than 0.01) and/or blockade of action potential generation. Resting postsynaptic membrane potential did not change significantly. These changes were reversible. However, even after the excitatory postsynaptic potential resulting from presynaptic nerve stimulation had fully recovered during washout of the local anesthetic, the threshold for evoking the spike potential (firing level) still remained elevated for both presynaptic and intracellular stimulation of the ganglion cell, suggesting prolonged cell depression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90328489\r", 
  ".W": "Because local anesthetic molecules interact with ion channel proteins embedded in membranes to effect impulse blockade, and because their clinical potency often depends on both vascular absorption and distribution into the tissue surrounding the site of deposition, the ability to partition into these various compartments is an important determinant of local anesthetic action. Therefore, the hydrophobic nature of local anesthetics used clinically was characterized by the octanol:buffer partition coefficients of their charged (P+) and neutral (Po) species. This was accomplished by previously described optical methods in which direct spectrophotometric measurement of both the pH-dependent distribution coefficient (Q) and of the ionization permit calculation of the pKa and partition coefficients. The rates of alkaline hydrolysis of ester-linked molecules also were measured to assess potential interference of such hydrolysis with the physicochemical assays. Results indicate that the hydrophobicity of a local anesthetic is increased by manipulation of the molecular structure at three sites: (a) the aromatic ring; (b) the intermediate linking group; and (c) the tertiary amine. Po for the agents studied was 10(3)-10(5) times greater than P+. Although there is no systematic relationship between hydrophobicity and pKa, the latter is greater with ester-linked (pKa = 8.59-9.30) than with amide-linked (pKa = 7.92-8.21) local anesthetics. All of the charged species, with the exception of bupivacaine, selectively partition into the aqueous environment (P+ less than 1.0). The temperature dependence of partitioning of the local anesthetics, measured at 25 and 36 degrees C, indicates an entropy-driven hydrophobic uptake. Solutions buffered with bicarbonate and including 5% CO2 showed the same local anesthetic partitioning as that of CO2-free solutions, suggesting that potentiation of impulse blockade by CO2 is not due to increased membrane uptake. Correlations of physicochemical properties of local anesthetics with potencies on isolated nerve confirm that the more potent local anesthetics have greater octanol:buffer partition coefficients, and that the ester-linked local anesthetics are more potent than their amide-linked counterparts having the same hydrophobicities. The correlations of structure with potency also suggest that the extracellular protonated species may contribute to impulse blockade.\r"

  ".W": "The recently introduced pulsed flash-lamp pumped tunable dye laser is used to treat cutaneous port-wine stains. In our practice, infants and children receive general anesthesia for these brief, yet painful, treatments. Because the flammability of this laser has not been reported and because we administer supplemental oxygen and nitrous oxide, we analyzed the incendiary potential of this laser by measuring the flammability of gauze and Telfa strips, hair, clear plastic face masks and tracheal tubes, and green nasal cannulae in 21%-100% oxygen and in nitrous oxide at laser energies between 6.0 and 10.0 J/cm2. (Our clinical range is 6.0-7.0 J/cm2.) In room air, gauze, Telfa, masks, and tubes did not ignite; only gauze ignited at high energy in 100% oxygen. Hair ignited in room air only when struck repeatedly at high energy, but easily ignited in 100% oxygen. Wetting hair with saline prevented ignition in room air and decreased flammability in supplemental oxygen. Green nasal cannulae prongs were extremely flammable in oxygen. Caution should be taken when using supplemental oxygen/nitrous oxide during treatment with the tunable dye laser.\r"

  ".W": "Short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in response to median nerve stimulation were recorded from the neck and the scalp before and during diagnostic high spinal anesthesia (touch T3, pinprick C8) in six patients with chronic pain. The central conduction time--the time difference between the neck-recorded N13 and the scalp-recorded N20--and the amplitudes of the SSEPs did not change in a statistically significant way during high spinal anesthesia. However, latencies of the neck-recorded N13 and the scalp-recorded N20 and P25 increased slightly. This may have been due to a local anesthetic effect on those spinal roots of the median nerve in which segmental pinprick analgesia occurred. Because high spinal anesthesia did not depress central nervous function, as measured by central conduction time, and SSEP amplitudes, it is concluded that scalp-recorded SSEPs during high spinal anesthesia measure the effects of local anesthetics in the cerebrospinal fluid on neuronal pathways outside the brain.\r"

We studied the effects of both time and end-tidal halothane concentration on IOP in 80 children (mean age +/- SD = 4.5 +/- 2.9 yr), to determine the most optimal time to make such measurements in anesthetized children. In 30 children the end-tidal halothane and nitrous oxide concentrations were kept constant while IOP was measured at 1-min intervals after the induction of anesthesia. Intraocular pressure did not change with time. In another 50 children IOP was measured immediately after induction, after 10 min of steady-state end-tidal halothane concentrations of both 0.5% and 1.0% in 66% nitrous oxide, and immediately after tracheal intubation. Intraocular pressure did not differ significantly at either halothane concentration but increased after tracheal intubation. We conclude that in patients anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide, IOP after induction remains constant over time and is not affected by end-tidal halothane concentrations up to 1.0% but is affected by tracheal intubation. Thus, the optimal time to measure IOP in children receiving up to 1% halothane in 66% nitrous oxide is during the first 10 min after induction, but before tracheal intubation.\r"

Onset, the time from the injection of vecuronium to maximal twitch suppression, and clinical duration, the time between vecuronium administration and return to 25% of the control twitch height, were recorded. Umbilical and maternal venous blood samples at delivery were analyzed for vecuronium concentrations. One-minute and 5-min Apgar scores and 1- and 24-h Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scores (NACS) were recorded. Individual tests of passive and active tone within the overall NACS profile were compared to evaluate further any residual vecuronium effects in the infants. Onset of neuromuscular blockade was 177 s in group 1 and 175 s in group 2. The corresponding clinical durations were 73 and 115 min. Maternal and umbilical venous vecuronium concentrations were 515 and 73 ng/mL in group 1 and 838 and 107 ng/mL in group 2. Seventy percent of neonates in group 1 had Apgar scores greater than 7 at 1 min, with 100% greater than 7 at 5 min. Corresponding values in group 2 infants were 50% and 80%. Fifty percent of group 1 infants had NACS of 35-40 at 1 h, and 70% at 24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nailfold capillaroscopic assessments and measures of in vivo platelet activation were performed. Triphasic color changes were present in all patients with systemic sclerosis, in 6 of 8 with undifferentiated connective tissue disease, but in only 1 of 7 with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. The occurrence of cyanosis correlated with evidence of impaired venous volume by strain gauge plethysmography and with higher degrees of capillary loop architectural abnormalities. The authors conclude that the presence of digital cyanosis is indicative of connective tissue disease and related to evidence of impaired digital venous capacitance. This may underlie the frequent presence of edema in these patients and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of capillary loop abnormalities.\r"

  ".U": "90328516\r", 
  ".W": "Laser angioplasty may offer percutaneous recanalization of occluded vessels where conventional guidewire and balloon techniques fail. Metal laser thermal angioplasty probes may, however, cause excessive thermal damage due to high tip temperatures (greater than 400.C). Therefore, contact probes made from artificial sapphire crystal designed for general laser surgery are currently being evaluated for use in laser angioplasty with continuous wave Nd-YAG energy. The sapphire modifies the laser energy in various ways, and this paper examines the physical characteristics of five types of rounded sapphire probe (SMTR, MTR, MTRL, OS, LT) and how these properties are affected by clinical usage. The laser beam profile emitted by these probes demonstrates a focal spot 1-2 mm in front of the tip. However, the forward transmission of Nd-YAG energy through the sapphires varied (SMTR, 85%; MTR, 83%; MTRL, 75%; OS, 54%; LT, 69%). Probe heating occurs owing to energy absorption within the sapphire. The surface temperature of the sapphires was measured in air by infrared thermography and the hottest region within the probes localized by an isothermographic technique. At energy settings used clinically (20 J, 10 watts for 2 s) the SMTR, MTR, and MTRL probes exhibited higher temperature rises (94-112.C) than the OS and LT probes (30.C), and heating was localized to the front surface of the former probes. Peak sapphire temperatures remained lower than those of metal probes even at higher energies. After clinical use, the MTR probe demonstrated reduced transmission, beam defocusing, and increased heating, due to surface pitting. Thus, recanalization with sapphire probes occurs by a combination of photothermal and contact thermal effects that are localized to the probe tip and may reduce the degree of thermal injury associated with metal probes. Understanding these basic properties is important to the application and development of contact probes for laser recanalization.\r"

Though resting TcPO2 cannot be used to aid the clinical diagnosis of exercise ischemia it may be useful in revealing asymptomatic chronic resting ischemia (9% of cases in this series). On the other hand, a posteffort (recovery phase) fall in TcPO2 had a predictive positive diagnostic accuracy for ischemia on exercise in 99% of the cases reported here versus 87% for clinical appraisal. In the light of these results, TcPO2 measurements coupled to a treadmill test walk perfectly ascertain exercise ischemia in arteriopathic patients, whether asymptomatic or not, and avoid the false-positive results obtained by clinical evaluation.\r"

The minimum values were attained two or three days after infarction and then rose to normal values within five to ten days. There was a mild degree of change and early recovery in 9 patients who underwent major abdominal surgery. The pathologic factors that could influence these two conditions are discussed. In those patients whose serum zinc concentrations were remarkably lowered, clinically estimated severity was far graver, and prognosis seemed to be much worse. It should be asked whether zinc supplementation would be of therapeutic benefit to patients with acute infarction.\r"

An occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery and an occlusion at the origin passing around the left atrial wall of the circumflex artery was observed. A large collateral artery connected the right coronary artery and the distal circumflex artery. This vessel showed a significant stenosis of 70%. This case suggests that collateral arteries are not protected from atherosclerotic degeneration. Alternatively, since the exact caliber of the anastomosis before the occlusion of the recipient artery is not known, an extrinsic compression or kinking may have generated the stenosis at the time of the flow-related dilatation of the vessel.\r"

There were no perioperative deaths. Five patients required reoperation, but only one required replacement of a defective facial vein. There were five postoperative strokes, but two were related to a contralateral occlusion. Two of the three ipsilateral strokes had a temporary indwelling shunt. Only one patient returned with recurrent neurologic symptoms. Five other restenoses of greater than 75 per cent were noted in three patients. One false aneurysm occurred three months after an external jugular vein patch angioplasty. External jugular vein, although requiring careful handling, is conveniently located in the operative field, does not appear to be associated with increased complications, has excellent long-term results, and allows preservation of the saphenous vein for other bypass surgery.\r"

To determine if this action is beneficial in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is due to changes in prostacyclin or thomboxane, thirty dogs were anesthetized and instrumented (left atrial, coronary sinus, left main coronary, pulmonary artery and femoral artery catheters). AMI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Either pentobarbital or alpha chloralose anesthesia was randomly assigned. Following LAD ligation, animals were randomized to receive PTH 0.008 nm/kg over 10 minutes every 30 minutes during the ischemic period or an equal volume of saline. Cardiac index, regional myocardial blood flow, O2 consumption and lactate production were measured. Infarct size was determined by computerized planimetry. PTH bioactivity was verified by adenyalate cyclase stimulating activity in rat osteosarcoma cells. Myocardial blood flow ranged from 81.5 to 155.2 ml/min/kg for normal myocardium. Cardiac index, O2 consumption, lactate production and myocardial perfusion was unaltered by the PTH administration. PTH reduced infarct size in dogs receiving pentobarbital but was deleterious in those receiving alpha chloralose. There was no difference in prostacyclin and thromboxane levels among groups. Conclusion: PTH is not beneficial in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-five acutely ischemic lower extremities, in 35 patients, which remained ischemic after standard thrombectomy/embolectomy techniques were further treated with distal tibial/peroneal thrombectomy/embolectomy by ankle level arteriotomy to increase limb salvage. A total of 84 infrapopliteal arteries were explored and thromboembolectomy performed in 79. The precipitating ischemic event was arterial embolus in 38 per cent, arterial thrombus in 60 per cent, and trauma in 2 per cent of the cases. There were 16 female and 19 male patients. Additional bypass grafting was used in 18 per cent of extremities. The limb salvage rate was 91 per cent in this select \"tibial/peroneal\" group. This technique salvaged 50 limbs that otherwise would have required major amputation. The addition of this technique changed the potential limb salvage rate from 76 per cent of the entire 199 lower extremities treated during this period to an actual limb salvage rate of 97 per cent. Operative mortality was 16 per cent in this selected group with an overall mortality of 6 per cent for all patients with acutely ischemic lower limbs. A mean patient follow-up of 32 months (range 12 to 72 months) identified only three late amputations, demonstrating that distal tibial/peroneal thrombectomy/embolectomy is a durable procedure. It is a technically easy means of promoting limb salvage in the acutely ischemic limb which either 1) remains ischemic after standard transinguinal iliofemoral thromboembolectomy, or 2) is secondary to infrapopliteal artery occlusion. It allows successful thromboembolectomy of acutely occluded infrapopliteal arteries without distal popliteal arteriotomy. These techniques should be within the armamentarium of all surgeons dealing with acute lower extremity ischemia.\r"

Presenting symptoms were TIA (36), CVA (25), amaurosis fugax (17), and asymptomatic carotid stenosis greater than 80 per cent (22). The average age was 61.8 years and 68 per cent were male. The operation was performed through a transverse neck incision with the use of flaps, a shunt was used (96%) and the artery closed primarily (95%). The heparin given was not reversed. There was no operative mortality and the stroke morbidity consisted of one permanent (1%) and one temporary (1%) deficit. Hematoma evacuations were required in four cases; one had a demonstrable bleeding point. The long-term stroke rate was 1.62 per cent, with overall survival of 94 per cent at 42 months. Restenosis following repair was noted in only 5.5 per cent of the cases at one year. When carotid endarterectomy is performed in a teaching institution, excellent early results (2% combined stroke/mortality rate) are maintained long-term. Furthermore, a 50-plus per cent decrease in the risk of stroke at 42 months is demonstrated when this study's results are compared to estimates of the natural history of significant carotid disease.\r"

The present retrospective series of consecutive patients was scrutinized to assess the incidence of sternal dehiscence following myocardial revascularization using the right and left internal mammary arteries. For comparison, the consecutive group of patients undergoing myocardial revascularization with unilateral internal mammary artery bypass was analyzed for similar sternal complications. In a consecutive series of patients, 277 patients underwent myocardial revascularization using the right and left internal mammary arteries for bypass. The overall operative mortality in this group of patients was 0.722 per cent. In this group there was an overall incidence of seven sternal dehiscences, both partial and complete for an incidence of 2.52 per cent. Upon analysis, it was shown that the female sex and diabetes were the conditions that most likely predisposed to the occurrence of sternal dehiscence whether partial or complete. For comparison, a consecutive group of 413 patients were analyzed for similar demographic data and results. The overall operative mortality in this group was 1.21 per cent. The overall incidence of sternal dehiscence both partial and complete, was 0.484 per cent. Both instances of sternal dehiscence occurred in diabetic patients and the data indicates, as in the bilateral internal mammary artery group, the presence of diabetes predisposed to the occurrence of this complication. The low overall incidence of sternal dehiscence in the expanded use of the mammary arteries should not deter the surgeon from aggressive use of the mammary arteries. One should use caution, however, in using bilateral mammary artery grafts in diabetics, women, and to a lesser extent, patients more than 70 years of age.\r"

The two groups treated with norepinephrine showed no statistical difference between their pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systolic blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance.

Creatinine clearance and renal blood flow were found to have no differences with or without renal range dopamine infusing in either group (P = 0.39 and P = 0.45, respectively).

Fifty-nine patients were evaluated for possible aortic injury. Patients who died before completion of the CT or aortogram were excluded. Widening of the mediastinum on chest x ray was the most frequent indication for follow-up studies. Twenty-five had a CT of the aortic arch alone. No study showed disruption. There were no false negative studies. Thirty patients had only aortography. Twenty-four were read as normal (one false negative). Six were read as positive (one false positive). In four, both studies were performed (CT/aortography--TP/TP, TN/TN, TP/FN, FP/FP). (FP = False Positive, TP = True Positive, FN = False Negative, TN = True Negative.) Six received surgical repair of the aortic injury (one death). In this experience, CT was used successfully as a screening tool for aortic disruption. It was highly sensitive in recognizing aortic injuries when present (100% vs. 75% for aortography) and in most cases did not require aortographic verification. False positive rates were comparable (CT = 3.8%, aortography = 7.7%). Specificity was also comparable (CT = 96%, aortography = 92%). Overall, four aortograms were inaccurate while only one CT was inaccurate. We recommend the use of CT for the evaluation of widened mediastinum in the stable patient.\r"

There was no significant correlation with Revised Trauma Score, symptoms, or associated thoracic injuries, although patients with aortic rupture did have a higher incidence of extrathoracic injuries (P less than 0.001). A blinded review of admitting chest radiographs for five major findings (widened mediastinum, aortic arch abnormalities, aortopulmonary window opacification, left apical capping, and right apical capping) revealed a significant difference between patients with and without aortic injury (0.98 +/- 1.24 findings in the negative aortogram group and 3.00 +/- 0.71 findings in the positive aortogram group) (P less than 0.001). All patients with aortic rupture had at least two major positive findings on admitting chest radiographs. Admission chest x-ray evidence of at least one major abnormality is a safe method of screening blunt chest trauma patients for thoracic aortography.\r"

  ".W": "This retrospective review was carried out to see if there is any role for selective management for intimal arterial injuries found in the extremities. The study involved retrospective analysis of arterial injuries seen in the extremities during the past four years. A total of 49 vascular injuries were identified which were proved by angiographic finding. There were eight cases which involved intimal injury in the nature of intimal irregularity or a flap seen in the angiogram. Four of these cases were treated surgically. There were four cases treated by conservative follow-up with the patient being placed either on low molecular weight dextran and/or low-dose intravenous heparin if there were no contraindications for the above. All of these patients had a successful outcome with normal angiographic findings of the injured area. The angiograms were done a few weeks following the injuries. The decision to treat conservatively was based on the nature of the injury as well as location of the injury, in one case being the origin of the anterior tibial artery, which is difficult to explore surgically. In conclusion, we believe that in selected instances where there is no distal vascular insufficiency because of the injury or if the patient has a lesion in a surgically difficult area to explore or if there are any other serious life-threatening injuries, the intimal artery injury can be managed conservatively. This also avoids the morbidity and mortality associated with surgical intervention.\r"

To assess our practice results, the records of 52 consecutive patients with rectal injury seen at Detroit Receiving Hospital from 1980-88 were reviewed. Etiologies were gunshot (40), shotgun (9), anal assault (2), and stab (1). There were no blunt injuries and no deaths. Treatment consisted of celiotomy (52), diverting colostomy (51), presacral drains (35), rectal stump irrigation (26), and primary closure (1). Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered in all patients. Despite lack of universal application of the \"standard\" principles, only five patients had postoperative complications and none were related to the rectal injury. Our results demonstrate that a single approach may not be justified, as excellent outcome was achieved with low morbidity and no mortality despite selective management. The universal application of colostomy, repair, irrigation, drainage, and antibiotics cannot be supported.\r"

The 1988-1989 survey results, when compared with the results for 1987-1988, show an increase in both the number of residency positions offered in internal medicine and the number of residents in internal medicine programs. Although the proportion of graduates from U.S. medical schools who choose internal medicine is not changing (34%), the proportion of U.S. medical school graduates who continue training in internal medicine after their first year is decreasing. The composition of the residents in internal medicine by medical school graduated is also changing. Almost 25% of the first-year residents (R1s) in internal medicine are now graduates of foreign medical schools (FMGs) compared with 14% in 1976. The proportion of first-year female residents in internal medicine has increased to 30%, whereas the proportion of both first-year blacks and Hispanics has remained constant at 5% each. In nearly 25% (109 of 440) of the residency programs, more than 50% of the R1s are FMGs. Hispanics, Asians, and blacks were found to be over-represented in the programs training larger proportions of FMGs. This over-representation is attributable, in part, to the fact that Hispanics and Asians may be FMGs. Training issues of concern to program directors continue to be the provision of ambulatory and primary care experiences and the scheduling of nights on call. The survey results show that many residency program directors have reported a reduction in the number of nights on call and an increase in the amount of time residents spend in ambulatory training.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of bone mineral loss in thyroxine-treated women with low thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH) levels with that in women without known thyroid disease. DESIGN: Cases selected from a prospective calcium trial. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from the Boston area. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 361 women enrolled in a 2-year calcium supplement trial, 18 received thyroxine for hypothyroidism. Of these, 10 were considered overtreated, because they had low TSH levels. Rates of loss of bone mineral density from the radius, spine, and hip during 1.9 +/- 0.6 years were measured by single- and dual-photon absorptiometry. When compared with women with no known thyroid disease (236 controls for the spine, 246 for the radius, and 237 for the femoral neck), women with low TSH levels had greater annualized, adjusted mean rates of bone loss from the spine (-2.89% +/- 0.65% compared with -1.13% +/- 0.13%, P = 0.009) and similar but not significant trends at the radius (-1.18% +/- 0.75% compared with -0.13% +/- 0.17%) and femoral neck (-1.39% +/- 0.80% compared with -0.28% +/- 0.19%). These means were adjusted for variables that affected the rate of loss in the control group (baseline bone mineral density and body mass index, calcium intake, and years since menopause). There were no statistical differences between the low TSH and control groups for any laboratory variables measured, including serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone or alkaline phosphatase, plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or 24-hour urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Thyroxine-treated women with low TSH levels lose bone mineral from the spine more rapidly than do women without known thyroid disease. These patients are therefore at increased risk for osteoporosis. The absence of detectable biochemical changes in women with low TSH levels may result from their relatively modest degree of overtreatment.\r"

DESIGN: Uncontrolled trial. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Five patients with AIDS-related complex: three homosexual men and one man and one woman with histories of intravenous drug abuse. One patient, a homosexual man, withdrew from therapy after 5 months but returned for monthly clinical and laboratory evaluations. INTERVENTION: Monthly treatments with extracorporeal photopheresis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Symptoms resolved in four patients. Lymphadenopathy disappeared in all five. Four patients had delayed-hypersensitivity reactions to skin testing (as defined by the Walter Reed staging classification). All showed increases in p24 and gp120 antibody levels. The CD4-cell percentage increased in four patients and declined in one after 6 months of therapy, but the absolute CD4 count decreased in two patients. At 15 months, the CD4 percentage remained at or increased over the baseline value in three patients still in the study but decreased in one. Levels of Beta 2-microglobulin decreased or remained stable in four patients. All patients were culture positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) before treatment. One patient had a negative viral culture after 5 months of treatment with confirmation. Two other patients became HIV culture negative, one at 14 and one at 15 months: The former patient became positive at 15 months and the latter patient remained negative at 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results suggest that extracorporeal photopheresis deserves further evaluation as therapy for AIDS-related complex.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a group of patients with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection receiving long-term dideoxynucleoside antiretroviral therapy. DESIGN: We examined the records of all patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe AIDS-related complex who were entered into three long-term phase I trials of zidovudine (azidothymidine, AZT) or zidovudine-containing regimens at the National Cancer Institute between 1985 and 1987. SETTING: The Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five HIV-infected patients with AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eight of fifty-five patients (14.5%; 95% CI, 6.5% to 26.7%) developed a high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell type, a median of 23.8 months (range, 13 to 35 months) after starting antiretroviral treatment. Using the method of Kaplan and Meier, the estimated probability of developing lymphoma by 30 months of therapy was 28.6% (CI, 13.7% to 50.3%) and by 36 months, 46.4% (CI, 19.6% to 75.5%). The patients who developed lymphoma had less than 100 T4 cells/mm3 for a median of 17.8 months (range, 7 to 35 months) and less than 50 T4 cells/mm3 for a median of 15.3 months (range, 5.5 to 35 months) before the diagnosis. All patients presented with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in extranodal sites, and two developed primary brain involvement in the setting of Toxoplasma infection. CONCLUSION: Patients with symptomatic HIV infection who survive for up to 3 years on antiretroviral therapy may have a relatively high probability of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Prolonged survival in the setting of profound immunosuppression with substantial T4-cell depletion is probably an important factor in the development of these lymphomas. However, a direct role of therapy itself cannot be totally discounted. As improved therapies for the treatment of HIV infection and its complications result in prolonged survival, non-Hodgkin lymphoma may become an increasingly significant problem.\r"

  ".W": "Transference is a process in which individuals displace patterns of behavior that originate through interaction with significant figures in childhood onto other persons in their current lives. It is a powerful determinant of patient behavior in medical encounters. Transference can affect the kind of physician-patient relationship a patient seeks and his or her response to interventions prescribed by physicians. The relationship is also strongly affected by the physician's own transference or countertransference. Rather than approach every patient in a uniform way, tailoring the approach to fit the relationship needs of the individual patient is advocated. Such tailoring would affect whether the physician is collaborative or prescriptive, how much personal information he or she shares, and how close or distant he or she is. Transference issues can also affect level of somatization and patient adherence to medical regimens. We discuss other problems with transference, such as the seductive patient and gift giving. By paying attention to the transference needs of patients, physicians can enhance the therapeutic alliance in which patients optimally participate in fulfilling their medical needs.\r"

These observations suggested that a systemic abnormality of glutamate metabolism might underlie the pathogenesis of ALS. We report here the findings of our studies of amino acid concentrations in patients with the sporadic form of ALS. Glutamate concentrations were normal in the fasting plasma of a great majority of the patients with ALS. Concentrations of glutamate, aspartate, and glycine were normal in the CSF of all 17 patients examined. beta-N-Methylamino-L-alanine, a plant neurotoxin possibly responsible for causing the Guamanian form of ALS, was not detectable in the plasma or CSF of any of our patients.

  ".W": "Recently, the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate was implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of chronic degenerative neurological diseases in humans and animals. This report describes abnormalities in excitatory amino acids in the central nervous system of 18 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The concentration of the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate in the cerebrospinal fluid were increased significantly (p less than 0.01) by 100 to 200% in patients with ALS. Similarly, the concentrations of the excitatory neuropeptide N-acetyl-aspartyl glutamate and its metabolite, N-acetyl-aspartate, were elevated twofold to threefold in the cerebrospinal fluid from the patients. There was no relationship between amino acid concentrations and duration of disease, clinical impairment, or patient age. In the ventral horns of the cervical region of the spinal cord, the level of N-acetyl-aspartyl glutamate and N-acetyl-aspartate was decreased by 60% (p less than 0.05) and 40% (p less than 0.05), respectively, in 8 patients with ALS. Choline acetyltransferase activity was also diminished by 35% in the ventral horn consistent with motor neuron loss. We conclude that excitatory amino acid metabolism is altered in patients with ALS. Based on neurodegenerative disease models, these changes may play a role in motor neuron loss in ALS.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examines the effects of mild hypothermia and hyperthermia on the density and distribution of ischemic brain damage, and compares these effects to those induced by variations in the duration of ischemia. Body temperatures were maintained at 35 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 39 degrees C, before, during, and after ischemia, and brain temperatures were held at similar values with a technique that in preliminary experiments proved to avoid intracerebral temperature gradients or overheating of surface structures. In all animals, brain damage was assessed by histopathological analysis of perfusion-fixed brains after six to seven days of recovery. Our results confirm previous findings showing that a decrease in temperature of only 2 degrees C significantly reduces damage to several selectively vulnerable neuronal populations. The results also showed that an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C significantly enhances brain damage. In general, a rise in temperature had effects similar to an increased duration of the ischemia. In some areas, such as the CA1-subiculum sectors of the hippocampus, temperature and ischemic duration altered damage in a gradual manner, but in others, such as the caudoputamen, there was a steplike change from virtually no to virtually complete damage. In some areas, the effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia appeared symmetrical around the normal temperature of 37 degrees C. Hyperthermia had some seemingly \"specific\" effects, however, notably the tendency to induce pannecrosis (\"infarction\") in the neocortex and caudoputamen, and to cause damage to the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The results underscore the potentially devastating effects of fever in patients with cerebrovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "To study the epidemiology of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) in Japan, we conducted two nationwide surveys between October 1986 and March 1989. A total of 710 patients with HAM (definite HAM, 589; probable HAM, 121) were reported. Of the 589 patients with definite HAM, 69% were residents of the areas with the highest prevalence HTLV-I in Japan. To determine the importance of blood transfusion in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP, we performed a case-control study in the Kagoshima district in southern Japan. Significantly more patients with HAM reported a history of blood transfusion (26/129, or 20%) than did subjects in a health survey of the general population (41/1,290, or 3%; odds ratio = 7.7, p less than 0.001) or than did hospitalized neurological patients (6/119, or 5%; odds ratio = 4.8, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, the cumulative percentages of the intervals between blood transfusion and the onset of the symptoms of HAM fit a lognormal curve, suggesting that transfusion was an important common exposure. Blood transfusion probably transmitted HTLV-I to the patients with transfusion-associated HAM because there was a significant decrease in the number of patients with the transfusion-associated HAM who received blood after implementation of nationwide screening of blood donors in 1986 (p = 0.004). In the first 2 years, screening the blood supply in Japan appears to have decreased the number of reported patients with HAM by 16%.\r"

Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was measured in depressed and nondepressed patients with PD and in age-comparable normal control subjects using 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography (PET). Relative metabolic activity in the caudate and orbital-inferior region of the frontal lobe was significantly lower in the depressed patients with PD as compared to both nondepressed patients and control subjects. There was a significant inverse correlation between relative glucose metabolism in the orbital-inferior area of the frontal lobe and depression scores. This study suggests that depression in PD is associated with dysfunction in the caudate and orbital-inferior area of the frontal lobe. This metabolic pattern is unlike that seen in patients with PD who have other behavioral deficits such as dementia, and suggests that disruption of basal ganglia circuits involving the inferior region of the frontal lobe may affect the regulation of mood.\r"

To test this assumption, we retrospectively evaluated the medical charts of all children who were admitted to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 1984 and March 1989, with the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Of the 30 patients identified, 7 were excluded because they had mild disease. Of the remaining 23, 9 underwent plasmapheresis and 14 served as historic control subjects. The two groups were similar with respect to age, presenting symptoms, findings on initial physical examination, and antecedent illnesses at the time of diagnosis. The mean time to recover to Grade 2 (independent ambulation) was significantly shorter in the plasmapheresis-treated group, 24.0 +/- 25.4 days, compared to 60.2 +/- 43.6 days in control subjects (mean +/- 1 SD). Our results indicate that plasmapheresis diminishes morbidity in childhood Guillain-Barre syndrome by shortening the interval until recovery of independent ambulation.\r"

Serial 1-micron-thick cryosections of ventral roots of animals with experimental autoimmune neuritis were labeled with Ox6 antibody against rat Ia, the ED1 antibody to identify monocytes/macrophages and an antiserum against S100, a marker for Schwann cells. Ia-positive cells were predominantly present before overt clinical signs and demyelination (day 12). At later stages when many axons were demyelinated, their number was markedly reduced. Few Ia-positive cells that had extending long processes, which over some distance were in immediate contact with several myelin sheaths, were scattered in normal-appearing nerve roots at these later time points. Most of the Ia-positive cells could be identified as ED1-positive lean monocytes/macrophages, but in contrast most phagocytic macrophages in advanced stages of myelin degradation no longer expressed Ia. Ia-positive structures were invariably negative for S100 at early and late stages of experimental autoimmune neuritis, indicating that Schwann cells did not express identifiable Ia antigen. These findings contrast with reports of expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens by Schwann cells in human neuropathies. Furthermore they do not support the notion that aberrant Ia expression by Schwann cells plays a major pathogenic role in experimental autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system.\r"

Each patient was evaluated independently by a junior resident, a senior resident, and a staff neurologist, who were required to make an anatomical and etiological diagnosis based solely on the history and physical examination. Fourteen patients were excluded because their diagnoses were known before admission. Of the remaining 86 patients, it was possible to confirm anatomical and etiological diagnoses in 40 by matching the clinical syndromes with highly specific laboratory findings. In the other 46 patients, the diagnoses could not be confirmed because the laboratory studies (including magnetic resonance imaging) were negative or nondiagnostic. In the 40 patients with laboratory confirmed final diagnoses, the clinical diagnoses of the junior residents, senior residents, and staff neurologists were correct in 26 (65%), 30 (75%), and 31 (77%), respectively. There was a trend for error rates to be higher among junior residents than staff (p = 0.06). The errors by the junior residents, [senior residents], (staff) were attributed to incomplete history and examination in 4 [1] (0), inadequate fund of knowledge in 4 [3] (3), and poor diagnostic reasoning in 6 [6] (6). These results indicate that technology is not a panacea for our diagnostic difficulties and that there is room for improvement in our clinical skills, especially diagnostic reasoning.\r"

The records of 197 patients operated on between 1974 and 1984 were reviewed. Univariate analysis indicated as prognostically significant the number (p less than 0.001) and percentage (p less than 0.001) of positive nodes, highest nodal status (p less than 0.001), macroscopic or microscopic nodal metastases (p = 0.002), presence or absence of extranodal disease (p = 0.003), clinical stage (III versus less than III, p = 0.015), and site (considered as trunk versus other locations, p = 0.02). However, by multivariate analysis, only three variables were shown to be independent determinants of survival: percentage of positive nodes (p = 0.004), presence or absence of extranodal disease (p = 0.012), and site (trunk versus other locations, p = 0.019). Combining these three variables, subsets of patients with markedly different prognoses could be generated. It is possible to predict a favorable outcome for patients with less than 10% positive nodes, no extranodal disease, and a primary lesion at a site other than the trunk. It is also possible to recognize that the prognosis is very poor for patients with extranodal disease and truncal primary lesions, regardless of the percentage of positive lymph nodes. Finally it was verified that the prognosis is always unfavorable when the percentage of positive lymph nodes is very high.\r"

The diagnosis was made 1 to 2 months more quickly in the last 8 years of the review than in the first 8 years, but the effect of early diagnosis on curability was negligible. Biliary obstruction was best treated by cholecystojejunostomy or choledochojejunostomy, which were equally effective. Anastomoses to the jejunum were safer and more effective than were those to the duodenum for the relief of biliary obstruction. Gastrojejunostomy should be performed prophylactically as well as therapeutically. It was effective and safe in both settings. Surgical palliation for pancreatic cancer was generally effective and was associated with an operative mortality rate of less than 10%. However morbidity was high, with significant complications occurring in one third of cases.\r"

Our aim was to determine the operative results in patients 70 years of age or older undergoing potentially curative radical pancreatic resection for pancreatic cancer from 1982 through 1987. Of 206 consecutive patients explored for potential resection, 42 patients (mean age, 75 years) had potentially curative procedures, including radical pancreaticoduodenectomy in 23 patients, total pancreatectomy in 8 patients, and distal pancreatectomy in 11 patients. Ductal adenocarcinoma was the most frequently encountered neoplasm (69%), but cystadenocarcinoma and islet cell carcinoma accounted for 12% and 7%, respectively. The overall operative mortality rate was 9%, while surgical morbidity was 28%, and medical morbidity was 12%. Overall median survival was 19 months, and 5-year survival was 4%. Despite the low overall incidence of resectability and postoperative cure rate for pancreatic carcinoma, exploration for potential curative resection should not necessarily be withheld for healthy, selected patients who are older than 70 years. Morbidity and mortality rates, although slightly greater than for patients who are older than 70 years, are acceptable.\r"

Twenty-one of the patients were female and five were male, with a median age at diagnosis of 37 years. Nine patients had polycythemia vera, 6 were receiving estrogen therapy, 5 had a previous hepatitis A or B infection, and 4 had cirrhosis. There was one case each of hepatic malignancy, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. In five cases no etiologic factors or associated disorders were identified. Ascites was the most common presenting feature in this group of patients. Hepatic function at the time of diagnosis, as measured by standard serum chemistries, was only minimally abnormal. The diagnosis of the Budd-Chiari syndrome was confirmed in all 26 patients by hepatic vein catheterization. Inferior vena cavography was also performed and revealed caval occlusion in 4 patients, significant caval obstruction in 13 patients, and a normal vena cava in 9 patients. Interpretation of the vena cavogram was helpful in selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for each patient. Twenty-three of the twenty-six patients underwent percutaneous liver biopsy before operation, with no morbidity or mortality. Four patients had well-established cirrhosis noted on biopsy. Thirty mesenteric-systemic venous shunts were performed on the 26 patients. In 11 patients a mesocaval shunt was performed and in one instance conversion to a mesoatrial shunt was required as a second procedure. In 15 patients a mesoatrial shunt was performed as the initial procedure. Graft thrombosis occurring in 2 of these 15 patients prompted one revision in 1 patient and 2 revisions in the second patient. After mesenteric-systemic venous shunt, eight of the patients (31%) died before discharge from the hospital. The remaining 18 patients in this series were discharged from the hospital alive and well with patent shunts. Patients were followed for a median of 43 months (range, 9 months to 13 years). Five late deaths occurred between 5 and 84 months after the operation. Three- and five-year actuarial survival rates were 65% and 59%, respectively.\r"

There were no substantial differences between the ER-positive and ER-negative groups in preoperative clinical and laboratory data such as sex, age, alcohol abuse, underlying liver disease, and hepatic functions. Large tumors were more common in the ER-negative group and therefore the incidence of major hepatic resection was significantly higher in this group. Histopathologic studies revealed no substantial differences between the two groups. Operative mortality rate was 11.5% in the ER-positive and 12.5% in the ER-negative group. Excluding eight operative deaths, the rate of tumor recurrence in the residual liver and long-term survival rate were identical for the two study groups. The current results may indicate that the presence or absence of ERs in human HCC does not correlate to either biologic or pathologic characteristics of this tumor, but the true role of ERs in human HCC remains to be elucidated.\r"

Survival after local or regional node recurrence was often prolonged; survival after distant metastases was usually limited. Patients with ocular primaries had the highest incidence of distant metastases, and the shortest subsequent survival. An additional 483 patients were identified who survived 10 or more years without evidence of recurrence; of these 651 patients with long disease-free intervals, 25% (168 of 651) developed recurrent disease. This demonstrates that a 10-year disease-free interval cannot be considered a cure, and emphasizes the importance of continued annual follow-up.\r"

This report summarizes our experience with five debilitated patients who developed acute upper extremity ischemia after forearm fistula construction corrected by fistula ligation. Successful angioaccess was achieved without ischemia recurrence by construction of proximal bridge fistulae with arterial inflow based on branch arteries of the axillary artery. The relatively small size of the branch vessel was the main factor in limiting fistula flow while permitting normal distal axillary artery flow. In four patients direct fistula flow measurements ranged from 200 mL per minute to 620 mL per minute. Axillary arterial flow distal to the fistula ranged from 120 to 200 mL per minute and did not significantly change after fistula construction or during temporary occlusion of the fistula. Four of the five patients continue to dialyze uneventfully from 4 to 8.5 months. One patient died after discontinuation of dialysis 1 month after operation.\r"

From 1969 to 1974, brachial artery ligation for insertion of a Scribner shunt was performed in 27 patients with a mean age of 8.4 years (range, 3 to 15 years). We examined 11 patients, all with functional renal transplants, a mean of 15.8 years (range, 13 to 18 years) after ligation. Nine patients had unilateral ligation and two had bilateral ligation. The patients were examined for arm length and circumference, resting blood pressure at the wrist, neurologic function of the arm, and exercise tolerance. A significant difference in resting arterial pressures in the ligated extremity was uniformly noted (mean systolic pressure 106 mmHg versus 123 mmHg in 7 patients, p less than 0.01). Although no patient specifically complained of problems with the ligated side, six of nine patients with unilateral ligation experienced arm discomfort on stress testing. There was no significant difference in limb circumference or length between the ligated and unligated extremity. Ligation of the brachial artery in growing children with renal disease caused diminished resting pressure and mildly decreased exercise tolerance but did not lead to limb loss or subsequent growth abnormalities.\r"

Four shock-plus-pneumonectomy pigs died acutely from right heart failure. When the five remaining shock-plus-pneumonectomy pigs were compared to the two control groups, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased to significantly higher levels than would be expected from the increase in PVR noted with resuscitation from shock alone and pneumonectomy alone. Right ventricular compensation maintained cardiac index in the hemorrhage-alone group and the pneumonectomy-alone group but could not maintain cardiac index in the shock-plus-pneumonectomy group, despite maximal increases in right ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate, and right ventricular end diastolic volume. These data indicated that resuscitation from shock plus pneumonectomy cannot be effectively accomplished because increased PVR leads to right ventricular failure, which limits left ventricular preload to levels that are insufficient to maintain cardiac index.\r"

  ".W": "The high-affinity cell-surface receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2R) consists of the 75-kilodalton (kd) chain and a 55-kd glycoprotein known as Tac. This report examines the cellular expression of IL-2R and secretion of the soluble form of Tac in immunosuppressed blunt trauma (n = 20, injury severity score -20) and thermally injured (n = 20, Total body surface area greater than 35%) patients. The percentage of IL-2R-expressing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in mitogen-stimulated cultures from patients and age-matched normal donors was determined by direct immunofluorescence with a monoclonal anti-Tac followed by flow cytometry analysis. Levels of soluble Tac in patient sera were measured by a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of Tac antigen by mitogen-activated PBMC cultures from blunt trauma patients was transiently reduced (by as much as 40%) in 4 of 14 patients examined. Levels of serum Tac were significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) in 15 of 20 blunt trauma patients ranging from 750 to 3000 U/mL compared with 180 to 420 U/mL in control subjects. All burn patients studied 10 to 50 days after the injury demonstrated a significant reduction (by 50% to more than 90%) in the percentage of IL-2 receptor-bearing cells. Similarly serum levels of IL-2R increased significantly (p less than 0.001 to 0.05) in all burn patients studied, reaching concentrations as high as 5500 U/mL. These results suggest that major trauma, whether mechanical or thermal, induces alterations in the T-lymphocyte activation process. However the degree and duration of such changes may vary based on the nature of the injury.\r"

  ".W": "In an experiment mimicking a severe surgical trauma by deliberate renal ischemia, the postoperative outcome in jaundiced rats was studied. Intervention studies were performed with preoperative oral lactulose (to reduce endotoxin toxicity) or preoperative internal biliary drainage. Compared to control, obstructive jaundice in rats significantly reduced survival time (p less than 0.001) and enhanced renal impairment (p less than 0.001) after renal ischemia. Preoperative supportive therapy of jaundiced rats with oral lactulose increased survival time (p less than 0.01) but did not reduce deterioration of renal function. Preoperative internal biliary drainage proved to be superior, with a significant reduction of renal impairment (p less than 0.001) and an improved survival time (p less than 0.001). Our experiments provide further evidence that obstructive jaundice increases the complication rate following major surgical procedures. Based on our results in rats, we suggest that in obstructive jaundice preoperative internal biliary drainage is the supportive therapy of choice. However, if adequate drainage is not possible, oral treatment with lactulose may help reduce postoperative complications.\r"

Rats were divided into three groups, i.e., a hyperoxic group, a hypoxic group, and a normoxic control group, which were supplied with 40%, 10%, and 21% oxygen, respectively, for 7 days after operation. All rats were fed intravenously (257 kcal/kg/day, kcal/N: 185.5) and whole-body protein turnover was measured using the constant infusion of 15N glycine technique developed by Picou and Taylor-Roberts. For six days after operation, the cumulative nitrogen balance was negative for the hypoxic rats, while hyperoxic rats showed a positive balance that was significantly higher than in control rats (p less than 0.01). Protein synthesis and breakdown rates increased markedly and the rate of synthesis exceeded that of breakdown in the hyperoxic group, but in the hypoxic group synthesis remained unchanged while breakdown increased moderately. These results indicate that oxygen, as a nutrient, is effective for improving postoperative protein metabolism.\r"

The development of agranular or granular endoplasmic reticulum varied from cell to cell. In some cells, many vacuoles and collagenous fibers were also seen. Thus, the adrenal tumor we examined was composed of the cells derived from the fascicular zone, which are associated with Cushing's syndrome, and the cells of the glomerular zone observed in association with primary aldosteronism.\r"

Seventy-two tumors were completely excised at the time of surgery; 56 patients had no evidence of tumor recurrence (mean, 91 months), and in 16 patients tumors recurred (mean, 117 months of follow-up). Patients with Gardner's syndrome had a much higher risk of recurrence and death related to fibromatosis or surgery for fibromatosis than sporadic cases. There was a weaker association between recurrence and multiplicity. A history of trauma or estrogen exposure, size, mitotic activity, gross circumscription, and histologic features did not correlate with recurrence. Biopsies or partial resections were performed on 10 tumors (8 in patients without Gardner's syndrome and 2 in patients with Gardner's syndrome). The patients without Gardner's syndrome did well: 7 are alive without evidence of disease (mean, 72 months) and 1 died of lung carcinoma at 108 months. The 2 patients with Gardner's syndrome have persistent fibromatosis: 1 patient had recurrence in the abdominal wall at 103 months and 1 is alive at 72 months with intra-abdominal masses. We conclude that mesenteric fibromatosis is much more aggressive in patients with Gardner's syndrome than in patients without Gardner's syndrome, that pathologic features are not good predictors of aggressive behavior, and that complete surgical excision may not always be necessary.\r"

For both feline and human skeletal muscles, the appropriate level of phenazine methosulfate eliminated fiber typing, which was falsely localizing the rate-limiting, bound reduced form of NADPH rather than the soluble G6PD. Use of a viscous solution of polyvinyl alcohol was necessary to prevent enzyme diffusion. Under these conditions, G6PD produced a mild myoplasmic stain with even sarcoplasmic reticulum granularity in human biopsy specimens. Fibers that were degenerating or regenerating by hematoxylin-eosin or alkaline phosphatase stains yielded an intense myoplasmic G6PD stain. Additional degenerating fibers were also often detectable with G6PD staining. No increased staining was found in denervated or atrophic fibers. Absence of staining (after 2 hours) was not a reliable indicator of G6PD deficiency, although it could be used for preliminary screening of muscle biopsy specimens.\r"

Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the breast is usually reported using four categories: definitely malignant, suspicious, benign, and unsatisfactory. We used likelihood ratios to show that fine-needle aspiration cytology of the breast appreciates each of these four categories fully. This approach is preferred above the usual one, which combines \"definitely malignant\" and \"suspicious\" categories as abnormal and often discards unsatisfactory aspirations from calculation. Knowledge of the prior probability of breast cancer and the likelihood ratio for a particular class of results of fine-needle aspiration cytology of the breast allows for easy calculation of the posttest probability of the disease. Application of this method should lead to more rational support from fine-needle aspiration cytology for clinical decision making.\r"

A survey of 81 blood gas laboratories in 25 cardiac transplantation centers and 73 blood gas laboratories in 36 general hospitals showed an increase in testing for potassium, free calcium, and glucose by blood gas laboratories since 1982 and extensive use of satellite laboratories near areas serving critically ill patients. The following three recent developments are improving the availability of laboratory results: (1) direct whole-blood measurement is gaining acceptance, (2) instrumentation designed specifically for rapid critical care profiling is being used extensively, and (3) testing is moving closer to patients. These trends suggest a significant change in laboratory support of critical care in the United States.\r"

A malignant polycystic pancreatic neoplasm in a 74-year-old black woman whose cyst-lining epithelium had none of the above-cited attributes and thus appears to represent an exception is described. The primary tumor was a large, encapsulated mass whose cysts contained watery fluid. Basically, two types of epithelium lined the cysts: a single layered, low-grade malignant-appearing type and a proliferative, overtly malignant-appearing pseudostratified and papillary type. Oncocytic metaplasia, canaliculi, and microvilli were ultrastructural features.\r"

The tumor was noteworthy for the presence of numerous fine intracytoplasmic lipid droplets confirmed by fat stain. Immunohistochemical studies revealed cytoplasmic positivity for chromogranin and neuron-specific enolase typical of pheochromocytoma. Electron microscopy demonstrated dense-core neurosecretory granules, in addition to the cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles. The presence of lipid within an adrenal pheochromocytoma is rare and, to our knowledge, has been documented in only one previous case report in the literature.\r"

  ".W": "Gingival granular cell tumor of the newborn, or congenital epulis, is a rare congenital lesion of uncertain histogenesis located exclusively on the alveolar ridge with marked predilection for female infants. Although histologically similar to the more ubiquitous granular cell tumor or myoblastoma, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies support separate histogenetic pathways for the two lesions. A newborn female infant with three gingival granular cell tumors is described herein along with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations. There was positive immunostaining for vimentin but staining for S100 protein was uniformly negative. Immunocytochemical assay for estrogen and progesterone receptors was also negative. The findings indicate a mesenchymal origin and the demonstration of intermediate filaments with fusiform electron densities suggests that some of the granular cells have morphologic attributes of myofibroblasts.\r"

  ".W": "Substantial body tissue wasting has been reported in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if progressive resistance exercise (PRE) would improve muscle function and increase body dimensions and mass in AIDS patients. The subjects were 24 male outpatient volunteers, status posttherapy for acute pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Subjects were randomly assigned to control (n = 12) or experimental (n = 12) subsets. All subjects underwent muscle function testing on 12 variables of torque, force, power, and work; three variables of anthropometry were assessed. The experimental group engaged in PRE three times per week for six weeks. The control group did not exercise beyond their usual daily living activities. Both groups were retested at the end of six weeks. In comparison to the control group, the experimental group significantly increased in 13 of the 15 study variables. Thus, during the nonacute stage of AIDS, physiologic adaptation occurred that improved muscle function and increased body dimensions and mass.\r"

  ".W": "This research provides a preliminary investigation of the relative efficacy of electromyographic (EMG) versus a novel biofeedback (BFB) approach to improve ankle control and functional gait in stroke patients. A computerized system was designed to provide audiovisual feedback of either muscle activity or ankle position during dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. The novel approach also included rhythmic pacing to emphasize the rapid timing of ankle motion necessary to switch from stance to swing during walking. Thirty-seven subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: (1) no-treatment control, (2) EMG BFB, and (3) rhythmic positional BFB. Blind evaluations of ankle performance, gait, and perceived exertion were performed at regular intervals. Analyses of covariance revealed that subjects receiving rhythmic positional BFB significantly increased their walking speeds relative to other groups at posttest (p = .02) and at three-month follow-up (p = .035), without any increase in subjectively reported energy cost. The ability of positional BFB to emphasize the timing events during walking provided optimistic results for carry-over into gait functioning. The degree of sensorimotor recovery and time since onset of stroke were considered important factors in determining outcomes.\r"
