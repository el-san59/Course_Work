The visual field data were then analyzed using six different statistical models. In only 15 of the 30 subjects did at least five of the six human observers agree on the behavior of the visual field. Agreement among the statistical models was better, with at least five of the six models agreeing on 22 of the 30 subjects. It was concluded that there is, at present, no validated technique for detecting progressive visual field loss in glaucoma using automated perimetry when relatively few visual fields are available for analysis.\r"

The posterior vitreous traction on the macula was released by tangential traction on the posterior vitreous surface, causing it to separate from the retina. The postoperative vision was the same or improved in each case. No operative complications occurred, but progressive nuclear sclerosis developed postoperatively in five of the 15 phakic eyes.\r"

The most reliable biomicroscopic signs of impending hole formation (stage 1) are the development of a yellow spot or ring in the center of the fovea, loss of the foveal depression, and no evidence of separation of the vitreous from the foveal retina. Although in a majority of eyes with stage 1 changes there is a progression to hole formation, spontaneous separation of the vitreous without hole formation may occur in some cases (44%) and cause characteristic biomicroscopic changes, including foveal reattachment, disappearance of the yellow spot or ring, and, in some cases, a pseudo-operculum, with one or more lamellar holes or facets. A prospective collaborative study is recommended to confirm these findings and to test the clinical value of surgical peeling of the vitreous cortex in eyes with stage 1 changes as a means of preventing hole formation.\r"

Despite successful anatomic reattachment in six of seven eyes with retinal incarceration posterior to the vortex vein ampullae, only two of seven eyes achieved visual acuity of 5/200 or better. In eyes with more peripheral retinal incarceration, anatomic reattachment was achieved in five of eight eyes and visual acuity of 5/200 or better was achieved in four eyes. Overall, a visual acuity of 5/200 or better was achieved in six (40%) of 15 eyes with a minimum follow-up of six months.\r"

The lesion was freely movable over the surface of the globe and was believed to be situated within the substantia propria. Histopathologic evaluation of the excised tissue disclosed that it was a collagenous mass of lamellar architecture, with a hypocellular dispersion of mesenchymal cells and a scattering of capillaries in the absence of inflammation. Electron microscopic examination revealed that the lamellar arrangement had regular lobular subdivisions composed of collagen fibers approximately 50 nm in diameter. Compressed fibroblasts occupied the peripheries of the lobules; the former exhibited abundant rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum and failed to elaborate basement membrane material. Delicate processes of the fibroblasts extended into the centers of the collagenous aggregates. To our knowledge, this is the first convincingly documented case of an acquired fibroma of the substantia propria of the epibulbar conjunctiva. The differential diagnosis in this case included related fibroblastic and simulating nonfibroblastic lesions.\r"

Cellular proliferation peaked three days after injection of the fibroblasts. The amount of tritiated thymidine incorporation that occurred three days following injection of irradiated homologous fibroblasts (incapable of cellular division) was not significantly different than that following injection of normal homologous fibroblasts, indicating that host cells were responsible for most of the cellular proliferation. Treatment with fluorouracil or triamcinolone acetonide completely arrested cellular proliferation following injection of normal fibroblasts.\r"

Intravenous iodoacetate produces widespread destruction of the outer retina with sparing of the inner retina, approximating total, confluent PRP. After PRP (at three weeks), intravenous injection of iodoacetate (at three weeks or four months), and in control rabbits, eyes were harvested and retinas were homogenized in a balanced salt solution. Retinal homogenates were measured for three markers of angiogenic activity: vascular endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and production of plasminogen activator. Retinas subjected to PRP or intravenous iodoacetate (at three weeks or four months) stimulated migration and proliferation above baseline levels twice as much as control retinas and stimulated plasminogen activator production by twofold to 2.5-fold. These data suggest that PRP does not eliminate the ability of the retina to produce angiogenic activity, but rather exerts its antiangiogenic effect in an indirect fashion.\r"

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the novel technique of photothrombosis to occlude corneal neovascularization. Sixteen rabbit corneas with previous ocular surface wounds that had healed with 360 degrees extensive neovascularization (persistent for 20 months) were used. After an intravenous injection of rose bengal solution (40 mg/kg of body weight [BW]), each vessel on the upper half of the cornea was occluded with a photochemically induced thrombus within ten shots of argon laser irradiation (514.5 nm, 130 mW, 63 microns, 0.2 s); those on the lower half were used as an internal control. Throughout the four-month study period, the treated vessels remained occluded, as evidenced by corneal fluorescein angiography. Corneal clarity was improved after treatment. A single injection of rose bengal at a dose of 8 mg/kg of BW or higher was sufficient for successful photothrombotic occlusion of corneal vessels within one hour of experimentation. Transient elevations of serum urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels and decrease of serum phosphorus level were noted on the first day after injection with 40 mg/kg of BW of rose bengal solution.\r"

  ".W": "The revised criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were formulated from a computerized analysis of 262 contemporary, consecutively studied patients with RA and 262 control subjects with rheumatic diseases other than RA (non-RA). The new criteria are as follows: 1) morning stiffness in and around joints lasting at least 1 hour before maximal improvement; 2) soft tissue swelling (arthritis) of 3 or more joint areas observed by a physician; 3) swelling (arthritis) of the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, or wrist joints; 4) symmetric swelling (arthritis); 5) rheumatoid nodules; 6) the presence of rheumatoid factor; and 7) radiographic erosions and/or periarticular osteopenia in hand and/or wrist joints. Criteria 1 through 4 must have been present for at least 6 weeks. Rheumatoid arthritis is defined by the presence of 4 or more criteria, and no further qualifications (classic, definite, or probable) or list of exclusions are required. In addition, a \"classification tree\" schema is presented which performs equally as well as the traditional (4 of 7) format. The new criteria demonstrated 91-94% sensitivity and 89% specificity for RA when compared with non-RA rheumatic disease control subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Results of carbohydrate analysis of serum IgG from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) confirmed an earlier report that IgG from patients with RA is galactosylated to a lesser extent than IgG from healthy individuals. In contrast to the previous report, we found that the content of galactose in IgG from controls and RA patients was negatively correlated with age (P = 0.026 and P = 0.010, respectively). In RA patients, the IgG content of galactose was also negatively correlated with the pain index (P less than 0.05) and was lower in the presence of rheumatoid factor (P less than 0.05). No correlation was found between the galactose deficiency of IgG from RA patients and sex, race, duration of disease, packed red blood cell volume, radiographic grade, disability index, extraarticular manifestations, articular erosions, or treatment with steroids. Furthermore, no correlation was found between the galactose content of IgG and serum levels of IgM rheumatoid factor or the ability of IgG to bind IgM rheumatoid factor in vitro. Significant galactose deficiency was also detected in IgG from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Crohn's disease, which suggests that the defect in the galactosylation of IgG is a feature common to a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases. The biologic significance of this observation remains unclear.\r"

Analysis of 29 cell lines revealed consistent differences between arthritic and normal fibroblasts. Cells cultured from inflamed synovial tissue exhibited higher autofluorescence than did control fibroblasts, and displayed exceptional light scatter properties in flow cytometry, indicating changes in cytoplasmic structures. Electron microscopic examination of the fibroblasts from arthritic synovial tissue revealed large numbers of round, swollen, laminated, mitochondrion-like bodies, which were not observed in the control fibroblasts. The changes observed by flow cytometry (light scatter and autofluorescence) coincided with the presence of the mitochondrion-like organelles. The strong autofluorescence observed in the arthritic fibroblasts resembled the fluorescence spectrum of mitochondrial flavoproteins. These data suggest that persistent metabolic and structural changes have occurred in the mitochondria of synovial fibroblasts and inflammatory synovial tissue. The usefulness of flow cytometry in identifying such cells is described.\r"

We analyzed these data to estimate work status and disability status, as well as earnings losses, associated with Symmetric Polyarthritis. Subjects identified in the survey as having Symmetric Polyarthritis were similar in age, race, sex, and marital status to rheumatoid arthritis patients seen in clinical settings. Overall, 51% of women with Symmetric Polyarthritis and 47% of men with Symmetric Polyarthritis were severely disabled, compared with 4.5% of women and 3.7% of men with no arthritis. Earnings of women and men with Symmetric Polyarthritis were only 27% and 48%, respectively, of earnings of individuals without arthritis. The total earnings gap between the 2 groups was +17.6 billion (1986 dollars). Econometric regression analyses indicated that about one-third of this earnings gap was explained by the presence of Symmetric Polyarthritis. The remaining two-thirds was explained by differences in age, education, and comorbidity between individuals with Symmetric Polyarthritis and those without arthritis. The earnings of individuals with Symmetric Polyarthritis, therefore, would be expected to be considerably lower than those of the general population, even if these individuals were not affected by arthritis. Nonetheless, earnings losses of at least +6.5 billion annually are explained by Symmetric Polyarthritis.\r"

All the SLE sera showed increased binding to poly(dA-dC).poly(dG-dT), compared with calf thymus DNA in the right-handed B conformation. No significant differences were noted in binding of selected SLE sera to the native DNAs that differed in G-C content or superhelicity of DNA. With poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) and poly(dG-m5dC).poly(dG-m5dC), the majority of SLE sera showed a preferential binding to the salt-induced Z form, compared with the B form. In addition, an average twelve-fold increase was found in binding to Z-form brominated poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) compared with B-form poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC), when the polymers were coated on the plates in 0.15M NaCl. The preferential binding of SLE sera to poly(dA-dC).poly(dG-dT) and to Z-DNA may be important in the formation of circulating immune complexes and subsequent vascular damage, or may provide a clue to the mechanism of production of anti-DNA antibodies in this disease.\r"

Thirty-five of 70 systemic sclerosis cases had renal tissue available for study: 26 had diffuse cutaneous involvement (9 with \"renal crisis\" and 17 without) and 9 had limited cutaneous disease (CREST syndrome [calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasias]). Age-matched (within 10 years) and sex-matched controls with renal specimens were obtained. New sections were cut from tissue blocks, and morphometry was completed using a Zeiss Image Analyzer. Using analysis of variance, the intimal area (Ai) was significantly increased (intimal thickening) in small and medium-sized arteries of patients with diffuse scleroderma and in small arteries of CREST patients, compared with those in controls, while a decreased medial area (Am) was seen consistently in all groups. The proportion of the vessel wall occupied by intima (Ai:[Ai + Am]) was significantly greater in all vessel size groups in patients with diffuse scleroderma compared with that in controls. The percentage of luminal occlusion was greatest in patients with diffuse disease with renal crisis. These same patients had severe edematous and mucinous intimal thickening in small and medium vessels, often in association with fibrinoid necrosis. We conclude that renal vascular structural changes are an integral part of systemic sclerosis. However, the significant differences between diffuse scleroderma patients and CREST syndrome patients, for both intimal thickening and percentage of luminal occlusion, suggest that the arterial disease in these 2 patient subsets is distinctive.\r"

Ulcers were assessed by the 4-hour single-dose gastric ulceration model and the 4- or 14-day repeated-dose intestinal ulceration model, using microscopic/planimetric quantitation. Oral dosages of up to 10 mg/kg of indomethacin in polyethylene glycol-400 resulted in substantial gastric ulceration, but not when given in methylcellulose suspension or as EPCMPV. Severe intestinal ulcers resulted following oral administration of indomethacin in either vehicle at daily 3-4-mg/kg doses, but did not result from EPCMPV formulations, whether dosed for 4 days or 14 days. Oral administration of pH-sensitive indomethacin liposomes constructed from cholesterol hemisuccinate resulted in loss of the protective action. Indomethacin-MPV showed both comparable bioactivity and comparable blood levels of the drug when contrasted with free drug in vehicles. Biodistribution studies demonstrated that when delivered from liposomes, drug and phospholipid are rapidly cleared through the stomach but then are differentially absorbed. Empty EPCMPV given by mouth also offered some protection against ulcers induced by systemic (subcutaneous) introduction of indomethacin, although better protective action was noted when the drug was first liposome-encapsulated and then given orally. The application of liposomes to the development of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that have minimal gastrointestinal side effects is discussed.\r"

Investigators apparently have paid little attention to these discrepancies.

The subgroup having anti-Ro only demonstrated significantly lower mean anti-Ro levels than did the subgroup with concomitant anti-La and showed a strong association with the linked HLA alleles DR2 and DQw1. The anti-Ro with anti-La subgroup was associated with the linked HLA alleles B8, DR3, DRw52, and DQw2 (DR3 was primary), and this subgroup consisted of patients with older ages at disease onset, sicca complex, and less renal involvement. Overall, the relative risk (RR) for having anti-Ro was highest in HLA-DR2/DR3 heterozygotes compared with non-DR2/DR3 heterozygotes (RR 15) and all other DR combinations (RR 7), suggesting a compound effect of 2 immune responses. Heterozygotes for HLA-DQw1/DQw2 demonstrated significantly higher mean levels of anti-Ro, which may be indicative of trans gene interaction at HLA-DQ.

  ".W": "The hyaluronic acid (HA) content of articular cartilage was studied in early experimental osteoarthritis (OA) in 16 normal dogs. The anterior cruciate ligament in the right knees of the dogs was transected; their left knees served as sham operated controls. The animals were killed at 7 and 14 weeks postsurgery. Although their total hexuronate, and thus proteoglycan, content remained unaltered during the period of study, the different weight-bearing areas of the OA knees displayed a progressive and significant decrease in HA content. We found no differences in the molecular weight and in vitro aggregating capacity of the HA molecules from OA cartilage versus those from control cartilage. This early relative depletion of HA could contribute significantly to the biochemical alterations of OA cartilage. Furthermore, it appears to be a good parameter for the differentiation of changes related to OA and changes related to aging.\r"

A series of 4 measures--a modified Schober's test, finger-to-floor with the subject standing on a 23-cm stool, chest expansion, and cervical rotation using an arthrodial protractor--were repeated completely 4 times. Subjects exercised between each series (except between the third and fourth series). Intra-rater reliability was determined by comparing measurement 3 with measurement 4, and the warm-up effect was determined by comparing measurement 1 with measurement 3. The Schober's test and chest expansion are stable measures and are not affected by warm-up. However, the finger-to-floor and cervical rotation exercises require warm-up to ensure stable values for clinical or research followup of spondylitis.\r"

The mean serum ethanol concentration in the alcohol group was 93 mg/100 ml (S.D. 17). The systemic arterial blood pressure was reduced by 6% in the alcohol group, P less than 0.05 compared with the control group. No significant changes occurred in the central venous pressure, the pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, or in cardiac output, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance. Alcohol intake in moderate doses has no measurable effect on pulmonary blood pressures or cardiac output in patients with ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy.

  ".W": "Acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, reacts with haemoglobin in vitro to produce acetaldehyde-haemoglobin adducts. Some clinical studies on the minor haemoglobins have suggested that these adducts may be formed in people abusing alcohol. Under hydrolysis of haemoglobin, with oxalic acid at 100 degrees C in sealed vials, some acetaldehyde was released and then specifically determined by HPLC. The kinetics of hydrolysis were studied using haemoglobin previously labelled with 14[C] acetaldehyde. The maximum liberation of 14 [C] acetaldehyde was obtained after 3 hr 30 min hydrolysis and this time factor was then utilized in the analysis of alcoholic and control haemoglobin. Thus, we have confirmed the formation of acetaldehyde haemoglobin adducts in vivo. It must be noted that the released acetaldehyde corresponds only to an index of the stable adducts. The levels were higher in alcoholics than in controls (1.417 +/- 0.171 and 1.295 +/- 0.139 nmol/mg Hb, respectively, P less than 0.001). In conclusion, this marker is not a convenient tool for the monitoring of alcohol exposure levels because of the low differences between alcoholic and control haemoglobins.\r"

Measurements were made before, during and after multivitamin supplementation, either orally or parenterally, on a controlled basis. Before treatment, only one case of thiamin deficiency was detected. Within 24 hr of receiving 250 mg of thiamin both treated groups showed an increase in their mean ETDP levels, though only that of the parenterally treated group was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than the pre-treatment mean. However, after 250 mg thiamin daily for 5 days, both treated groups showed a significant (P less than 0.05) and almost identical increase in their mean ETDP levels (90 nmol/l. and 91 nmol/l. for the oral and parenteral routes respectively). The results suggest that except for alcoholics requiring thiamin urgently, for whom the parenteral route is demonstrably quicker at raising tissue levels, oral supplementation achieves the same result as parenteral.\r"

We therefore chose two groups of alcoholics, group 1 consisting of 76 mainly unmarried or divorced lower class alcoholics who had attended the emergency department while intoxicated, and group 2 consisting of 108 mainly married middle class alcoholics with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The control group consisted of 98 randomly chosen hospital patients. There was no significant difference between group 1 and group 2 in the prevalence of fractures detectable with chest radiography (25% and 21.3% respectively). 8.2% of the controls also had fractures. The fracture prevalence did not correlate with socioeconomic group. Married alcoholics had significantly less thoracic fractures than unmarried, divorced or widowed alcoholics as a group. The sensitivity and specificity of the fractures visible on chest radiograph as a marker for alcoholism is not sufficient to warrant its use in clinical or research work.\r"

Results showed that the stereotypes of the heavy drinker as 'tough and rebellious' and the abstainer as 'weak and cissy' persist into adulthood. Heavy drinkers were seen as low on 'sociability' and 'sexual attractiveness' and abstainers were seen as less 'sociable' than moderate drinkers. There was also some evidence of a 'double standard' in perceptions of male and female drinking roles. Other findings concerning the effects on perceptions of subjects' sex and drinking behaviour are compared to those reported in the earlier study and implications for the treatment of alcohol problems are discussed. It is concluded that the dimensions described by Davies and Stacey represent a relatively stable structure within future research where fresh initiatives in alcohol education may be located.\r"

Marrow cells were initially enriched for megakaryocytes by a Percoll density gradient and megakaryocytes were labeled with a fluoresceinated monoclonal antibody directed to the GPIIb/IIIa complex. The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained with propidium iodide (PI) for DNA quantitation. Using two-color flow cytometry, megakaryocytes were identified by their high membrane immunofluorescence and their ploidy was determined according to the relative fluorescence intensity of the PI. Forward light scatter (FSC), correlating with cell size, 90 degrees side light scatter (SSC), reflecting primarily cell internal fine structure and granularity, and total cell membrane fluorescence were examined. To evaluate independently the relationship between size and cell membrane fluorescence obtained by flow cytometry, megakaryocytes were sorted directly on slides and analyzed by a laser-based anchored cell analyzer (ACAS). There was a strong correlation among size, SSC, and the level of membrane fluorescence. The mean diameter of megakaryocytes was 28.1 +/- 12.3 micron. The modal ploidy distribution was 16N with approximately one-fifth of the cells less than or equal to 4N. The mean FSC and SSC levels increased with increasing ploidy. However, the marked overlap observed between the ranges of these parameters in adjacent ploidy classes suggested that size and SSC increase continuously rather than by discrete steps as is characteristic for ploidy. The total surface membrane fluorescence was correlated with cell size (r = 0.98) as measured by FSC or directly by the ACAS (r = 0.85), and with cell ploidy (r = 0.99) indicating an augmentation in total membrane GPIIb/IIIa expression with an increase in cell size and ploidy. However, estimated GPIIb/IIIa fluorescence density was inversely correlated with FSC suggesting that the GPIIb/IIIa surface epitope density is decreased with increasing cell maturity. We conclude that flow cytometry is a useful technique for the rapid analysis of human megakaryocytes obtained by marrow aspiration, and should be applicable to studies of pathologic states.\r"

After intravenous injection, 125I-plasminogen associated rapidly with the endothelium (approximately 0.1 pmol/cm2 at saturation) and passed through to accumulate in the subendothelium. At two to 15 hours after injection, 11 to 15 times more radioactivity was associated with the subendothelium than with the endothelium. Removal of the endothelium by balloon catheter led to a rapid adsorption of 125I-plasminogen by the luminal surface of the vessel; saturation (9.1 pmol/cm2) was attained at ten to 20 minutes after deendothelialization. Of the adsorbed plasminogen (radioactivity), only 2% to 4% was associated with the adherent platelet monolayer. Uptake of 125I-plasminogen by the deendothelialized vessel was not significantly inhibited by epsilon-aminohexanoic acid whether injected before or after the 125I-plasminogen. No evidence of plasmin activity at the aorta surface was found from either transmission electron microscopy studies or from amidolytic assays of plasminogen-saturated deendothelialized aorta samples before or after urokinase treatment. Balloon catheter treatment in vivo, however, generated significant antiplasmin activity of the deendothelialized aorta surface. We conclude that plasmin formed in vivo is probably inactivated by the antiplasmin activity that is associated with the subendothelium.\r"

  ".W": "Because thrombin aggregates afibrinogenemic platelets and platelets from patients with the gray platelet syndrome and because antibodies to fibrinogen inhibit thrombin-induced aggregation only at low concentrations of thrombin, the role of fibrinogen in the formation of thrombin-induced aggregates was investigated further with human platelets washed and resuspended in Tyrode-albumin solution containing apyrase, either with or without added Ca2+ (2 mmol/L). Samples for immunocytochemical assessment of fibrinogen distribution were taken at several times (up to five minutes) after aggregation induced by 0.5 U/mL of thrombin. Glutaraldehyde-fixed samples were embedded in Lowicryl K4M, sectioned, incubated with goat antihuman fibrinogen, washed, reacted with gold-labeled antigoat IgG, and prepared for electron microscopy. By 10 seconds, small aggregates formed, and granules were centralized; alpha granules were heavily labeled with immunogold, but the platelet surface was not. As large aggregates formed, granule swelling or fusion occurred, and in some areas granule material seemed to be in contact with the exterior. In these experiments with no added fibrinogen, there were some clusters of gold particles on the platelet surfaces remote from sites of granule discharge, but there were large areas where platelets were in close contact with little or no fibrinogen detectable between them. No fibrin was visible up to five minutes after the addition of thrombin, which indicated that fibrinogen from the granules does not readily become available for fibrin formation in the ambient fluid. Similar results were obtained in media with and without added Ca2+. Thus at least some aggregation in response to thrombin can occur without the participation of released fibrinogen, and much of the granule fibrinogen appears to remain localized at sites where granules fuse with the plasma membrane or the open canalicular system. Incubation of unstirred samples with thrombin for ten minutes resulted in the formation of small aggregates, extensive gold label in regions connected to the exterior of the platelets, but very little gold labeling of the platelet membrane and no visible fibrin formation. When the platelets were aggregated in the presence of external fibrinogen, the morphological changes within the platelets were the same, but fibrinogen rapidly became associated with the entire platelet surface, and visible fibrin formed within 30 seconds in the medium containing 2 mmol/L Ca2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that increasing factor XIII concentrations above that present in plasma (1 U/mL) results in the formation of very high molecular weight alpha fate polyacrylamide and agarose gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In this report, we have examined the effect of such crosslinking on plasmic susceptibility of fibrin prepared from purified fibrinogen and from plasma in the presence of factor XIII concentrations between 0 and 10 U/mL. The crosslinking achieved with purified fibrinogen at 1 U/mL factor XIII increased resistance to plasmic degradation by 32% as measured in a radiolabeled clot lysis system. However, further increases in plasmic resistance occurred at factor XIII concentrations of 2 and 10 U/mL, the latter decreasing the lysis rate to 45% of that which occurred in the absence of factor XIII. To achieve the same rate of clot lysis with fibrin formed using 10 U/mL rather than 1 U/mL of factor XIII, an increase in plasmin concentration of up to 4.2-fold was required. Similar results were obtained using clots prepared from plasma in the presence of factor XIII concentrations greater than 1 U/mL. Since the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor content was the same for fibrin at 1 or 10 U/mL factor XIII, the increasing plasmic resistance could not be attributed to increased binding of the inhibitor. We conclude that fibrin prepared in the presence of factor XIII at concentrations exceeding that in plasma shows increased resistance to plasmic degradation, which is likely explained by the formation of very high molecular weight alpha polymer chains.\r"

  ".U": "88193367\r", 
  ".W": "We compared the proliferation of mononuclear and multinuclear cells in four Hodgkin's cell lines, HDLM-1, HDLM-1d, L-428, and KM-H2, by examining their capacity to incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into nuclei. Approximately 5% of all cells in HDLM-1 cultures had two or more nuclei, a characteristic of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. Unlike mononuclear Hodgkin's (H) cells, these RS cells exhibited no uptake, or only minimal uptake of BrdUrd, suggesting that they did not replicate actively. Cytogenetic study showed that 25% of the HDLM-1 cells contained a tetraploid (4X) set of chromosomes with a characteristic two-peak distribution. Following treatment of HDLM-1 cells with phorbol ester, the percentages of 4X cells and RS cells increased to 50% and 12%, respectively. This increase in RS cells was not likely to be due to cell fusion as shown by the absence of hybridization of BrdUrd-positive and -negative nuclei. Phorbol ester has a short-term effect of blocking the exit of cells from G1 into S phase, but no effect on the transition from S phase to G2/M phase. The block is more prominent in 2X cells than in 4X cells, which may explain the increase in percentage of 4X cells in phorbol ester-treated cultures. In addition, phorbol ester induced the differentiation of H-RS cells, which was accompanied by loss of the marker HeFi-1 from the cell surface. Approximately one third of the RS cells did not express HeFi-1, or expressed only minimal amounts. The findings led us to the following conclusions: (1) The 4X cells probably are formed from 2X H cells as a result of disturbed cytokinesis, but not a cell fusion. (2) A considerable number of 4X cells were H cells, because the number of 4X cells consistently exceeded that of RS cells. (3) Since mitotic figures are extremely rare in RS cells and these cells did not show active BrdUrd uptake, the increased number of RS cells must also be a consequence of disturbed cytokinesis of H cells or a result of nuclear transformation (twisting, convolution, or separation of the nucleus) in H cells. (4) Most RS cells lose their proliferating capacity and some RS cells may undergo further differentiation. Uptake of BrdUrd and phorbol ester induction were also studied on the other three H-RS cell lines, HDLM-1d, L-428, and KM-H2, with results similar to those for HDLM-1.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes a black family in which two distinct structural defects of alpha spectrin were inherited singly and in combination. The propositus, who has a poikilocytic hemolytic anemia that shares many of the features of hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) or homozygous elliptocytosis, is a compound heterozygote for both the spectrin alpha 1/65 and spectrin alpha 1/50a defects as demonstrated by electrophoretic analysis of spectrin tryptic fragments. The spectrin alpha 1/65 defect alone was found in his mother and sibling, while the spectrin alpha 1/50a defect was present in the father and another sibling. The red cell spectrin content was normal in all family members. The functional consequences of inheritance of these two spectrin defects were compared with those found in an unrelated patient with classic HPP who had the alpha 1/50a spectrin defect and was spectrin deficient as well. Prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C resulted in striking budding, fragmentation, and sphering of classic HPP red cells but only minimal changes in propositus cells. The percentage of spectrin dimers was increased tenfold in classic HPP, sevenfold in the propositus, and threefold in other family members. Mechanical stability of erythrocyte ghosts, measured by ektacytometry, was reduced severely in both classic HPP and in the propositus, but only moderately in other family members. Thus, co-inheritance of two alpha spectrin defects can result in a poikilocytic hemolytic anemia milder than that usually found in HPP. The greater clinical severity of HPP may be a consequence of the presence of spectrin deficiency, a finding absent in the propositus.\r"

All three known A gamma types were observed, ie, the British type (-198, T----C), the Chinese type (-196, C----T), and the Green type (-117, G----A); the latter has been found in a black family. Of the six families with G gamma-beta+-HPFH, three had C----G at -202 and none T----C -175. Conditions for hybridization of amplified DNA with the specific probes are provided and the usefulness of the technique is discussed. The increase in numbers of A gamma(G gamma)-beta+-HPFH heterozygotes with specific base substitutions greatly enhances the probability of a direct correlation between these substitutions and the increase in the production of a specific gamma chain.\r"

We used radioimmunoassays for the protein C activation peptide (PCP) and the prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 to quantitate the extent of in vivo activation of protein C by thrombin-thrombomodulin and prothrombin by factor Xa, respectively, in the blood of individuals with this clinical disorder. A total of 46 protein C deficient subjects from 18 kindreds were studied. In 23 nonanticoagulated patients with an isolated deficiency of protein C, the mean level of PCP was substantially reduced while the mean concentration of F1 + 2 was significantly elevated as compared with normal controls (1.10 pmol/L v 1.78 pmol/L, P less than .0005 and 2.54 nmol/L v 1.51 nmol/L, P less than .0005, respectively). The metabolic behavior of 131I-F1 + 2 was found to be similar in protein C deficient patients and normal individuals. However, we were unable to establish a significant correlation between decreased PCP levels and increased F1 + 2 measurements in these 23 patients. This study demonstrates that heterozygous protein C deficient individuals with equivalent plasma levels of the zymogen may have markedly different biochemical profiles when assay techniques are used that quantitate the in vivo activity of the coagulation system. Six individuals from three pedigrees were identified as having combined deficiencies of protein C and either antithrombin III or protein S; the genetic basis for the combined deficiency state was determined in two of the kindreds. Finally we observed that hemostatic system activity as measured by the PCP and F1 + 2 assays is markedly suppressed in protein C deficient patients who are chronically anticoagulated with coumarin derivatives.\r"

In order to determine if in vivo generated hemoglobin-spectrin complexes may play a role in increased membrane rigidity of certain pathologic red cells, we measured both these parameters in membranes prepared from hereditary xerocytosis (Hx), sickle cell disease (Sc), and red cells from thalassemia minor (beta thal). Membranes were prepared from density-fractionated red cells, and membrane deformability was measured using an ektacytometer. Hemoglobin-spectrin complex was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel analysis, as well as by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against the beta-subunit of hemoglobin. For these three types of pathologic red cells, progressive cellular dehydration was associated with increased membrane rigidity and increased content of hemoglobin-spectrin complex. Moreover, the increase in membrane rigidity appeared to be directly related to the quantity of hemoglobin-spectrin complex associated with the membrane. Our findings imply that hemoglobin-spectrin complex is generated in vivo, and this in turn results in increased membrane rigidity of certain pathologic red cells. The data further suggest that oxidative crosslinking may play an important role in the pathophysiology of certain red cell disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The formation and degradation of fibrin play a central role in hemostasis, but other activities have been associated with fibrin(ogen)-derived peptides, which suggests that products of fibrin(ogen) turnover may be involved in inflammation and wound healing. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the plasmic fibrinogen-derived peptide B beta 1-42 has effects on inflammatory cells and fibroblasts (FB). B beta 1-42 was found to be a potent chemotaxin for neutrophils (PMN) and FB, maximally stimulating PMN migration at 10(-9) mol/L peptide. Unlike the chemotactic factors f-Met-Leu-Phe and C5a, B beta 1-42 did not induce the release of lysosomal hydrolases and superoxide anion from PMN, nor did it stimulate directed movement of monocytes (MN). These features of B beta 1-42 resemble the properties of human fibrinopeptide B (hFpB), the 14-reside, thrombin-cleaveable fragment that constitutes the amino terminus of B beta 1-42, and suggested that the chemotactic effects of B beta 1-42 are mediated through its hFpB domain. Against this conclusion, however, were observations that (a) desensitization of PMN with 10(-7) mol/L hFpB ablated chemotaxis to hFpB without affecting chemotaxis to B beta 1-42; (b) antiserum to hFpB, which recognizes the B beta 1-14 sequence both free and bound to larger fragments of the B beta chain, blocked hFpB chemotactic activity but did not affect B beta 1-42-mediated chemotaxis; (c) desensitization of PMN with equimolar amounts of hFpB and beta 15-42 (10(-7) mol/L), the isolated carboxyterminal sequence of B beta 1-42 remaining after the removal of hFpB, completely inhibited B beta 1-42-mediated chemotaxis; and (d) beta 15-42 itself was chemotactic for PMN. These data indicate that PMN recognize several independent domains within the amino terminal region of the human fibrinogen B beta chain and that these biologic effects extend to mesenchymal cells.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined using clearance of 99mTc-DTPA and iohexol. Creatinine, water, urea and electrolyte excretion was assessed from timed urine collections. Excretion of water, urea and electrolyte was normal during obstruction but increased dramatically immediately following relief (e.g. sodium 110 to 234 mmol/24 h). Values returned to normal by 2 weeks (sodium excretion 148 mmol/24 h). No further significant changes occurred up to 3 months. Mean 99mTc-DTPA and iohexol clearances during obstruction were 59.0 and 50.5 ml/min respectively. Following relief of obstruction, no significant improvement occurred at 2 weeks but did at 3 months (mean = 68.4 and 55.7 ml/min). Mean creatinine clearance during obstruction was 32.5 ml/min. This improved 2 days following relief to 46 ml/min. No further improvement was seen until 3 months (mean = 57.3 ml/min). It was concluded that recovery of renal function from obstructive injury occurs in two phases, an early tubular phase lasting up to 2 weeks and a later, predominantly glomerular phase, between 2 weeks and 3 months. There is some disparity between creatinine clearance and more accurate measurements of GFR which may be explained by tubular excretion of creatinine in the early phase of recovery.\r"

Preliminary results are reported on 94 children with 137 refluxing ureters and a follow-up period of at least 18 months. All children with reflux grade III or less had antibiotic treatment only. Those with reflux grade IV were randomised for antibiotic treatment alone versus surgery plus antibiotic treatment, while the primary treatment of reflux grade V was reimplantation. In 91 ureters treated by antibiotics alone, reflux disappeared in 49 cases; in 20 cases the grade of reflux was reduced. In 46 ureters treated by reimplantation, reflux was cured in 40 cases and no severe ureteric obstruction was seen. Conservative management of reflux grade IV seems to be less successful than surgery. The results of conservative, non-surgical treatment of reflux grade I to III are satisfactory, but for grades IV and V reflux surgery seems to be the treatment of choice if detrusor instability can be excluded.\r"

Thirty-six per cent of surviving patients with chronic retention and 24% of those who underwent elective prostatectomy had residual urinary symptoms at the time of the study. Of patients who were sexually active pre-operatively, 34% felt that the operation was responsible for a deterioration in their sex lives. The incidence of retrograde ejaculation was 93%. It was concluded that prostatectomy is a safe operation with good patient acceptability.

Twenty patients with early disease were entered into the pilot study. Three were excluded after staging (2 T0a and 1 with positive nodes on pelvioscopy-T2 N1 M0); 17 received a full course of treatment. Mean follow-up was 6 months (range 1-14). Two early patients with excessive residual tissue had initially positive biopsies and underwent second treatments with subsequently negative biopsies. Two patients continue to have positive biopsies and the rest are negative. No tumour has progressed and complications have been minimal. One patient experienced reduced frequency of erections and 1 required bladder neck incision for symptomatic bladder neck stenosis at routine follow-up endoscopy. There were no other effects on either potency or continence.\r"

Inadequate staging by omitting marker assays or CT scan reduced prognosis. Failure to use standard chemotherapy (PVB, BEP, POMBACE, VAB) or a reduced dosage diminished survival. Regular investigations are necessary during treatment, including marker assays, chest X-ray and CT scan. Frequent monitoring is important in later follow-up. Management by a urologist improved survival, especially if he was involved from the outset. The results also favoured the concept of combined management by a urologist and an oncologist.\r"

The mean follow-up in CR patients was 7 +/- 4 months and 47 +/- 23 months in SC patients. Stool frequency per 24 h was less than or equal to 2 in all CR patients while it was greater than 2 in 40 per cent of the SC patients (P less than 0.05). Three CR patients and six SC patients had minor incontinence, all but one of the rest were fully continent. One patient had a major leak. There was no significant difference in mean resting anal voluntary contraction pressure in the two groups, with mean values within the normal range. The mean rectal sensitivity threshold volume in CR patients (83 +/- 30 ml) and SC patients (52 +/- 22 ml) was significantly different (P less than 0.05) as was the mean maximum tolerable volume (317 +/- 122 ml and 174 +/- 83 ml respectively, P less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in balloon expulsion testing, defaecating proctography or methyl cellulose evacuation in the two groups.

A failure rate (i.e. excision of the pouch) of 3 per cent was observed. Sepsis was the most common postoperative complication, and was most often related to ileoanal anastomosis dehiscence (15 per cent), followed by small-bowel obstruction requiring laparotomy (10 per cent). Clinical 'pouchitis' occurred in 14 per cent of patients after ileostomy closure. The average frequency of defaecation was four motions per 24 h; evacuation was spontaneous in all patients and only 5 per cent complained of troublesome faecal soiling while 34 per cent had occasional incontinence to flatus and mucus. Patients with a short or absent rectal cuff had a lower rate of incontinence (30 versus 48 per cent, difference not statistically significant) without any increase in the frequency of genito-urinary disorders. None of the two most used reservoirs, the J (n = 40) and S pouch (n = 17) showed significant superiority in terms of bowel frequency and continence. Incontinence was more likely in patients whose ileostomy closure had been delayed for more than one year.\r"

Collagen synthesis in the anastomotic area was measured by incorporation of [3H]proline. With a defunctioning proximal colostomy, the synthesis and accumulation of collagen in the anastomosis was diminished, and the anastomotic strength development delayed and reduced. The development of anastomotic strength seems to proceed according to the level of strain from intraluminal bulk. As the healing of the anastomosis protected by a diverting colostomy was uncomplicated, these findings should not contra-indicate the use of diverting colostomy.\r"

All 224 such patients proven to have hepatocellular carcinoma in a single hospital were included in the study. Of 205 patients undergoing a complete diagnostic work-up, 134 [65.3 per cent) were judged on clinical criteria to be inoperable, 23 (11.2 per cent) had pulmonary or osseous metastases, and 38 (18.5 per cent) proved on hepatic imaging and 5 (2.4 per cent) on hepatic arteriography to have an irresectable tumour. Thus, only five (2.4 per cent) of these patients proceeded to laparotomy. Another 7 patients who did not have an arteriogram, 9 with surgical emergencies, and 2 mistakenly believed to have an amoebic hepatic abscess also underwent laparotomy. Only 2 patients (0.9 per cent of 223) proved to have a resectable tumour. The extremely low resectability rate reinforces the urgent need for a surveillance programme to detect early tumours in high-risk members of this population.\r"

The bowel had been brought out through the rectus abdominis muscle in 107 patients and lateral to it in 23 patients. The respective prevalence of parastomal hernia in these groups was 2.8 per cent and 21.6 per cent. The highly significant difference indicates that enterostomy should be constructed through the rectus abdominis muscle, not lateral to it.\r"

All of the freshly disaggregated colorectal and gastric human adenocarcinomas responded to pentagastrin in 24 h cultures in vitro. Two newly established adenocarcinoma cell lines showed a response to pentagastrin at passage 2 but not at passage 6. Long-established cell lines did not respond to pentagastrin; however, upon synchronization of the human gastric cell line, MKN45, a trophic growth response with gastrin-17 was observed. This response was enhanced when the same cell line was grown as a xenograft in nude mice and then examined in vitro for gastrin dependence; this dependence was gradually reduced on further in vitro passaging. These results indicate that trophic responses to gastrin are lost during in vitro culture and may be underestimated by using long-established tumour cell lines. However, as all of the early cultures of colorectal and gastric tumours respond trophically to gastrin, perhaps gastrin-receptor blockers may be an important therapeutic modality for these patients.\r"

Laser energy was delivered with a 600 micron quartz fibre, at a wavelength of 504 nm and a pulse length of 1 microseconds. Pulse energy was varied from 30-140 mJ, producing peak pulse powers of the order of 100 kW. With these parameters the laser ablated fatty, fibrous and calcified plaques. At this wavelength atheroma is vaporized but there is minimal damage to normal vessel wall, due to preferential absorption of the laser light. Light microscopy shows that by microsecond pulsing, thermal damage to surrounding tissues associated with continuous wave lasers is avoided. Transmission electron micrographs reveal a sharp demarcation between a laser crater and the adjacent vessel wall with little ultrastructural disruption. Scanning electron micrographs show the crater walls to be smooth. The pulsed dye laser may therefore be effective in the treatment of occlusive peripheral vascular disease without undue risk of vessel perforation.\r"

We studied 24 normal legs (N), 21 with primary varicose veins without chronic swelling, skin changes (liposclerosis, eczema, pigmentation) or ulceration (PVV) and 59 with chronic swelling and/or skin changes and/or ulceration; of these 59 legs, 31 had primary varicose veins (PVV/S) and 28 had popliteal reflux (PR). The classification was done according to clinical examination, Duplex scanning, ambulatory venous pressure measurements and venography. There was an increased incidence of sequelae with increasing values of VFI. The incidence of these sequelae was irrespective of whether reflux was in the deep or in the superficial veins. VFI is a practical non-invasive measurement of reflux. It should be used to study the effect of therapy and particularly to evaluate new reconstructive procedures designed to abolish reflux in the deep veins.\r"

Three of the six short grafts were venographically patent at 2 weeks, while all the long grafts were occluded.

In three of the patent specimens no clear tissue changes were found with light microscopy, while in the others changes of inflammation and fibrosis were noted. Scanning electron microscopy revealed good 'endothelialization' in two specimens, and partial 'endothelialization' in the others. No dilatation or severe stenosis of the patent grafts was seen. The occluded grafts remained only as a fibrous strand with sutures.\r"

In patients receiving no supplement plasma vitamin C concentrations had fallen (mean 33 per cent) by the first postoperative day and thereafter changed little. The falls occurred irrespective of initial plasma concentration, were greater the higher the initial concentration, but tended to be proportional to the length of operation. In patients given supplements this loss of vitamin C was evident but modified, and from the second postoperative day the response to the supplements was as would have been expected in non-operated subjects. The most probable explanation for the loss of vitamin C from plasma was an increased urinary excretion during operation. Changes in BL vitamin C concentrations were studied in relation to changes in leucocyte and platelet counts. The previously reported postoperative falls in BL vitamin C were found to be the result of a major artefact in the methods routinely used for BL vitamin C estimation, caused by changes in the leucocyte and platelet populations, most importantly the platelet to leucocyte ratio. No true demand for vitamin C, as measured from the buffy layer cells, was evident.\r"

Eighty-eight patients underwent surgery with an operative mortality of 11.3 per cent. In only 63.5 per cent of cases could the patient be discharged directly home. By 2001, in Oxford, the proportion of acute surgical beds occupied by patients aged over 80 will increase to 9.2 per cent from the present 7.0 per cent. Unless additional resources are provided to meet this extra demand for acute surgical care of the old, elective surgery for younger patients will inevitably be curtailed.\r"

Out of a total of 1022 laparotomies performed in a 5-year period on one surgical unit, the incisional hernia rates were available for assessment in 699 freshly made incisions, 142 reincisions and 36 incisional hernias. The incidence of incisional hernia was 6 per cent after freshly made incisions and this incidence was increased after both re-incision (12 per cent, P less than 0.05) and incisional hernia repair (44 per cent, P less than 0.01). With the exception of jaundice, none of the other commonly accepted risk factors for incisional herniation were significantly increased in those patients with re-incised wounds who subsequently developed a hernia, when compared with patients who did not develop a hernia. An increased risk of incisional herniation is present when laparotomy is performed through a previous abdominal incision.\r"

Enhanced growth was also observed after abdominal surgery combined with allogeneic blood transfusions while syngeneic blood transfusions had no effect. These experimental findings have been confirmed in retrospective clinical studies. The allogeneic blood transfusion effect may be avoided in cancer patients by autologous blood transfusions although this implies blood donation before surgery. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of blood loss before surgery on formation ('take') of lung colonies, and on the outgrowth of established metastases in the BN rat model. These aspects of tumour behaviour were also investigated in rats undergoing surgery, or receiving blood transfusion, or both, after blood loss. The results indicate that blood loss has a profound stimulating effect on the growth of established metastases, but not on the 'take' of tumour cells. This stimulating effect was also present when blood loss was combined with surgery, while previously surgery alone was found to have no effect. Allogeneic and syngeneic transfusions in combination with blood loss both had a strong stimulating effect on growth of established lung metastases. The results indicate that blood loss may be an important factor in determining the outcome of metastatic growth.\r"

Different needle sizes (23G, 21G, 19G) passed in random order, five, ten and fifteen times into the tumours, were compared. The type of tumour, needle size and number of passes independently and significantly influenced cell yield. A 21G(green) needle passed into the tumour at least 10 times was the most efficient in obtaining cells. This in vitro study could explain the variation in the reported accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology from groups using different techniques and is perhaps one reason why the highest diagnostic accuracy and the lowest rate of unsatisfactory aspirates comes from a centre which uses a 21G needle and at least 10 passes through the tumour.\r"

Fourteen patients sent from other hospitals had a recurrent fistula; in thirteen cases the hyoid bone was still in place. All patients who had the central part of the hyoid bone excised were cured.

With the exception of tooth extraction, only procedures that were not done more than 86% of the time as inpatient or outpatient procedures were considered. Large differences between the hospitals and between physicians within each hospital were found in the rates of outpatient surgery, even after adjustment for patient characteristics and differences in case mix. If the standard of the hospital with the highest rate of outpatient surgery were followed by the seven other hospitals, up to 17.5 inpatient beds could be closed or freed. However, the potential savings from substituting outpatient for inpatient procedures must be realistically appraised. The appropriate place for monitoring the use of inpatient and outpatient surgery may be the individual hospital, particularly those with high occupancy rates and a large demand for inpatient beds.\r"

  ".W": "From 1976 to 1983, 28 patients (24 male and four female) with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were treated by intraarterial chemotherapy at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan, Milan, Italy. Tumors were retrospectively classified by a previously proposed staging system. Two patients were classified as Stage I and 26 as Stage II. Liver cirrhosis was present only in the males (in 50% of them). Nineteen patients were treated with doxorubicin (Adriamycin [Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH]) and nine with 5-fluorouracil. Systemic toxicity was mild, but the treatment induced hepatic toxicity (ascites, clinical jaundice, or biochemical impairment) in 18% of noncirrhotic and 66% of cirrhotic patients. Clinical reduction of hepatomegaly was observed in 50% of noncirrhotic versus 16% of cirrhotic patients. Doxorubicin was effective in 66% of noncirrhotic patients and 20% of cirrhotic patients, with an overall response rate of 42%. 5-fluorouracil was effective only in patients without cirrhosis, with an overall response rate of 22%. Overall median actuarial survival was 3.5 months, with a significant difference between noncirrhotic and cirrhotic patients (6 versus 2 months, respectively). Overall median survival of patients who responded to the treatment was 13 versus 2 months for nonresponders (P less than 0.001). Liver cirrhosis was the most important prognostic factor in terms of liver toxicity, response rate, and survival. This study emphasized the negative impact of the treatment on cirrhotic patients. Also, the real value of intraarterial administration of doxorubicin was investigated.\r"

Thirteen similar reactions, in patients treated with single-agent DTIC, are reported in the literature. Several clinical and pathologic features distinguish this DTIC toxicity from Budd-Chiari syndrome and veno-occlusive disease (both well-known types of possibly drug-related hepatic vascular disease) and make it a distinctive syndrome. We were impressed by the repeated occurrence of this complication in a relatively small set of patients, in contrast with the rarity of the literature reports. We suggest that this dramatic complication could occur more frequently than commonly thought. Therefore, caution should be used with DTIC, particularly in curable patients.\r"

Sixty-four lesions were missed 74 times, giving a 90% sensitivity of the radiographic methods used. Of the errors, 82% were perceptive, and 3% were interpretative. Eleven examinations in nine patients revealed no lesions, although the examinations were done within 2 years of the diagnosis of a carcinoma. Missed lesions were more common than expected in the cecum and the ascending colon (P less than 0.001), and 18% of the patients had multiple tumors (expected incidence 3.6%, P less than 0.001). The median delay in diagnosis was 20 months, and patients whose diagnosis was delayed for a long time tended to have more advanced carcinomas at diagnosis. As a lesion was identified either at the initial examination or retrospectively 730 of 741 times, the potential sensitivity of the radiographic methods used was 99%. It is concluded that barium enema is still an excellent method for the detection of colorectal carcinoma provided that perceptive errors can be minimized.\r"

Eighty patients were treated with radiotherapy, 50 having radical and 30 having palliative treatment. Sixty-nine patients had squamous cell carcinoma, four had adenocarcinoma, one had sarcoma, one had mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and five had undifferentiated tumors. Forty percent developed no stricture, 30% had benign fibrotic stricture, and 28% developed malignant stricture. The etiologic factors analysed included age, pretreatment swallowing score, histology and length (size) of tumor; stage of disease, dose of radiotherapy, and use of chemotherapy. None of these factors were shown to be of etiologic importance. The survival of patients who developed benign strictures was found to be significantly longer (1-year survival 88%) than those who developed no stricture (50%) or malignant stricture (19%). Using a \"success score\" for palliation of dysphagia, it was found that the majority of patients (71%) who developed a benign stricture had a moderately successful outcome--they were able to tolerate a full or soft diet and required dilatation with a median duration between dilatations of 5 months. Patients who developed a malignant stricture were palliated poorly by dilatation alone, and most required esophageal intubation.\r"

A histologic examination showed goblet cell metaplasia and intestinal metaplasia without Paneth cells in rats treated only with olive oil. Only goblet cell metaplasia was found in rats treated with tetragastrin. These results show that the prolonged administration of tetragastrin to rats after NaOH treatment increases gastric acid secretion and suppresses the induction of intestinal metaplasia.\r"

Serum ferritin levels were greater than 1000 ng/ml at the early phase of disease. When disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed in patients, serum ferritin levels elevated further to greater than 12,000 ng/ml. MH patients were treated by combination chemotherapy, and VAHS patients were given prednisone. Each MH and VAHS patient died within 1 week from the onset of DIC, without decrease of serum ferritin level. One MH patient with continued high serum ferritin levels for 3 months after DIC also died. The remaining patients with decreased serum ferritin values less than 1000 ng/ml at 3 months after DIC are now alive with normal serum ferritin levels. These results suggest that serum ferritin level in histiocytic proliferative disorders is a useful indicator of disease activity in both neoplastic and reactive conditions rather than only a marker of malignant process.\r"

These risks increase to 11 and 3.2 times, respectively, in women who also have a family history of breast cancer. This study reviews lesions detected mammographically in a series of patients with documented risk factors. The pathologic specimens of 100 consecutive localization breast biopsies performed for nonpalpable abnormalities detected mammographically were reviewed and classified according to the criteria of Dupont and Page in order to determine the incidence of AH and proliferative breast disease. The mammographic characteristics and historical risk factors of these women also were correlated. Twenty percent of the biopsy specimens showed carcinomas, 55% of which were noninvasive. AH was found in an additional 10% of the biopsy specimens, whereas proliferative disease without atypia occurred in 21% of the biopsy specimens. Forty-nine percent of the biopsy specimens showed nonproliferative changes. This study demonstrated that mammography, in addition to its ability to detect small nonpalpable cancers, identifies a high percentage (31% in this series) of women with pathologic lesions known to have an elevated risk for subsequent breast cancer. The current impetus for large-scale mammographic screening of asymptomatic women mandates the development of rational therapeutic protocols to accommodate the widening spectrum of high-risk pathologic lesions found in these selected populations.\r"

The pathologic stage, lymph node involvement, and pleural involvement were found to be the major determinants of prognosis (P less than 0.01). In addition, other single factors, such as tumor differentiation (P less than 0.01), vascular invasion (P less than 0.01), the degree of collagenization in the fibrotic focus (P less than 0.01), the standard deviation (SD) of nuclear areas (P less than 0.05), and mitotic index (P less than 0.05) correlated significantly with prognosis by the log-rank test on the Kaplan-Meier survival curves of these factors. Patients with dense infiltration of \"T-zone histiocytes\" survived significantly longer than those with less infiltration (P less than 0.05). Cox's proportional hazard general linear model analysis showed the importance of factors, such as lymph node or pleural involvement and the SD of nuclear area, when the pathologic stage was excluded, and of the mitotic index when all four factors were excluded to emphasize the cellular characteristics. It is possible to predict the postoperative prognosis of patients with small pulmonary adenocarcinoma more precisely by combination of the above histopathologic factors.\r"

  ".W": "In order to elucidate the biologic behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the long-term prognostic impact of the pathologic features of 143 surgically resected HCC were studied. Seventy-four were smaller than 5 cm in diameter (small HCC), and 69 were larger (large HCC). This study confirmed that tumor size was an important but not the only determining prognostic factor in HCC. Although cirrhosis could cause hepatic failure, patient mortality was mainly attributable to tumor recurrence, which, in turn, was strongly correlated with the invasive nature of HCC. Tumor invasion to the liver and the intraportal spread were very frequent and particularly extensive in large HCC. In both small and large HCC the noninvasive groups not only had high 4-year actuarial survival (84.6% and 90%, respectively), but there was also no patient mortality from intrahepatic tumor recurrence. Therefore, it was concluded that invasiveness of an HCC is the most crucial factor in determining the long-term outcome for the patient, and that the clinical course of resected HCC is predictable in a great majority of the cases. In our small HCC series only 2.4% of HCC were regarded as having true multicentric origin. These findings suggest that the majority of HCC occur unicentrically, and that multiplicity and tumor recurrence result mostly from intrahepatic dissemination. In both small and large HCCs invasive tumors were accompanied by high patient mortality from tumor recurrence even when the tumor was small, indicating that intrahepatic spread may start very early during the growth of HCC.\r"

Forty-three of these were monomorphic adenomas and 37 were pleomorphic adenomas. Seven malignant tumors of the upper lip were as follows: four adenoid cystic carcinomas, two acinic cell carcinomas, and one adenocarcinoma. Of the 16 lower lip tumors, 15 (93.8%) were malignant. Thirteen of these were mucoepidermoid carcinomas and two were acinic cell carcinomas. The only benign lower lip tumor was an intraductal papilloma. These results confirm the findings of previous investigations, showing that minor salivary gland tumors are much more common in the upper lip than the lower lip, but that lower lip tumors are more likely to be malignant.\r"

Sham-coarcted (n = 16) and two-kidney, one-clip (Goldblatt) hypertensive rats (n = 13) served as controls. Tail, femoral, and carotid arterial pressures rose (p less than 0.01) in the two-kidney, one-clip hypertensives; only carotid pressure rose (p less than 0.01) in the coarcted rats, tail and femoral pressures remaining normal (p greater than 0.25). Thus, the hindquarters of the coarcted rats remained normotensive. Four to six weeks after surgery we perfusion-fixed vascular tissues of the hindquarters, including kidneys, with formalin at in vivo levels of pressure. Glycol methacrylate-embedded tissues were sectioned at 1 micron thickness and vessels quantitatively evaluated. The outer medial and lumen perimeters of abdominal aorta, femoral artery, and renal arterioles were measured; from these measurements, vessel outer and lumen diameters, medial thickness, medial area, and medial thickness-to-lumen radius ratios were calculated. Compared with sham-coarcted rats, abdominal aorta, femoral arteries, and renal arterioles less than 61 microns outer diameter in rats with coarctation and Goldblatt hypertension had significantly increased (up to +100%) medial area, medial thickness, and medial thickness-to-lumen radius ratios. In general, magnitudes of abnormalities were similar in Goldblatt and coarcted rats. Renal arterioles greater than 60 microns outside diameter in Goldblatt hypertensive, but not coarcted, rats also were thickened. These results indicate that vascular wall thickening occurs in conduit arteries and smaller renal arterioles in the normotensive hindquarters of coarcted rats, providing morphometric evidence for non-pressure-related mechanisms involved in vascular growth in this form of hypertension.\r"

The major triggering factor for fibrinolysis is vascular tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and the aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of human arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) for induction of fibrinolysis. SMC were plated on labeled fibrin gels, and lysis was measured as release of label. Fibrinolytic capacity was dependent on the phenotypic state of SMC. The \"multilayered phenotype\" to which SMC modulate after cellular injury had a much lower fibrinolysis-inducing capacity than the more ordinary \"monolayered\" SMC type. Fibrinolysis was mediated by activation of plasminogen. In long-term experiments under conditions imitating thrombolysis, platelet-derived growth factor promoted fibrinolysis indirectly by increase of SMC number, and a direct effect on cellular production of t-PA was not detected. SMC from atherosclerotic intima had a much lower capacity for induction of fibrinolysis than cells from adjacent nonatherosclerotic intima. SMC also displayed several structurally detectable interactions with the fibrin substratum, such as organization of the gel by means of extension of numerous filamentous processes and contraction and wrinkling of the gel. In conclusion, human arterial SMC in vitro induce fibrinolysis by activation of plasminogen. This capacity is dependent on phenotype and lowered for SMC from atherosclerotic intima, suggesting impairment after arterial injury and in atherosclerosis.\r"

Action potentials were recorded simultaneously from dog Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle fibers using conventional microelectrode techniques. APD change during alternans was dependent on the preceding diastolic interval in the same manner as during restitution in Purkinje fibers but not in ventricular muscle fibers. The course of memory change was not affected by the presence of alternans in either fiber type. In Purkinje fibers, APD alternans was attenuated by a Ca2+ channel blocker, nisoldipine (2 X 10(-6) M), and augmented by a Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K 8644 (3 X 10(-8) M). These effects were attributed to the changes in the kinetics and the amplitude of restitution. In ventricular muscle fibers, APD alternans was always preceded and accompanied by alternans of action potential shape. Alternans of both action potential shape and APD was suppressed by nisoldipine (2 X 10(-6) M) and attenuated by Bay K 8644 (3 X 10(-8) M). These results show that in Purkinje fibers, APD during alternans can be explained by restitution and memory effect. However, in ventricular muscle fibers, the mechanism of APD alternans is linked to factors controlling action potential shape. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that APD alternans in Purkinje fibers depends on the differences in the recovery of membrane currents generated by the preceding action potential and in ventricular muscle fibers on the differences in the concentration and/or handling of intracellular calcium.\r"

Small artery and vein O2 saturations were obtained microspectrophotometrically and combined with radioactive microsphere blood flow determinations to calculate regional myocardial O2 consumption in open chest dogs. Denervation significantly reduced the preocclusion heart rate from 165 +/- 16 beats/min in the control to 114 +/- 13 in the chronic surgically denervated and to 137 +/- 15 in the chemically sympathectomized groups. After 2 hours of occlusion, the O2 consumption and flow were similar in the nonischemic area except for lower values in the surgically denervated group. Total coronary blood flow and O2 consumption in the occluded regions were not significantly affected by chronic denervation. However, significant elimination of areas with low venous O2 saturation (less than 20%) were found in the ischemic myocardium of the chronically denervated groups as compared with the control or with the acutely denervated dogs. The mean venous O2 saturation was found to be significantly higher in all regions of these two groups as compared with the control. The O2 extraction was also lowered. Thus, chronic denervation reduced microregional heterogeneity of oxygenation in the ischemic myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In vascular smooth muscle, phorbol esters cause a slowly developing contraction and an associated transmembrane calcium flux, both of which are inhibited by dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists. In the A7r5 cultured vascular cell line, we used the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique to identify voltage-dependent calcium conductances and investigate the effect of phorbol esters on that conductance having characteristic dihydropyridine sensitivity (slowly inactivating, high-threshold, \"L-type\"). With barium as the charge carrier, large-amplitude (100-800 pA) inward currents of two types were characterized by their kinetics and voltage dependence. With holding potential--80 mV, a rapidly inactivating, low-threshold current (\"T-type\") was activated by depolarizations above-40 mV and was maximal at -10 mV. With holding potential -30 mV, this component was inactivated, and a second slowly inactivating, high-threshold current was activated above -10 mV and was maximal at +10 to +20 mV. These currents are similar to the T-type and L-type currents previously described in vascular smooth muscle cells. When added to the bath, the active phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (100 nM) increased the slowly inactivating (L-type) current by 32 +/- 20% (n = 8, +/- SD). Phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (100 nM) caused a similar effect, but the inactive phorbol, 4-alpha-phorbol (100 nM), did not. We conclude that at least two distinct calcium conductances are expressed in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells, and that the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium conductance is acutely modulated by phorbol esters, presumably acting through stimulation of protein kinase C. Such modulation may play a role in increasing transmembrane calcium influx mediated by agonist-receptor interactions that lead to activation of protein kinase C and may help to sustain or amplify calcium-dependent cell responses.\r"

In these experiments, the time-dependent effects of quinidine on the delayed rectifier potassium current, IK, a current contributing to cardiac repolarization, were investigated in acutely disaggregated guinea pig ventricular myocytes using the whole-cell recording configuration of the patch-clamp method. The effect of quinidine on IK was dependent on the duration of depolarization. After long (2,000 msec) pulses, IK was reduced by 30 +/- 27% (SD; n = 8, paired) by 10 microM quinidine; in contrast, after short (100 msec) pulses, the drug decreased IK 65 +/- 35% (p less than 0.05). This effect was found both in paired experiments as well as when quinidine-pretreated cells were compared to non-pretreated cells. Quinidine significantly delayed IK activation (9 +/- 20 msec at baseline vs. 44 +/- 25 msec in drug, p less than 0.05), but did not alter the subsequent time course of activation (time constant 659 +/- 118 msec). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that quinidine promotes occupancy of a channel state from which opening does not occur.\r"

The isolated, separately perfused, neurally intact canine gracilis muscle preparation was used since it permits deliberate and quantifiable alterations in background sympathetic activity, as measured by skeletal muscle vascular resistance. Systemic intravenous UK-14304, a highly selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, produced a precipitous, neurogenic vasodilation that lowered vascular resistance below the subsequently denervated resistance, thus indicating that an active vasodilation was involved. The overall magnitude of the vasodilation was much greater in animals that had been hemorrhaged to elevate background sympathetic activity than in animals that had been transfused to lower background activity. The neurogenic vasodilation was unaffected by baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary receptor denervation and by prior cholinergic-receptor blockade of the gracilis muscle. Prior H1- and H2-histaminergic-receptor blockade, on the other hand, eliminated the active vasodilation but not a vasodilation down to the subsequently denervated resistance. Prior alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade lowered resistance down to the subsequently denervated resistance and greatly attenuated the active vasodilation. The present study demonstrates that withdrawal of sympathetic activity by alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation produces an active vasodilation resulting from histamine release in skeletal muscle as well as a passive vasodilation resulting from lysis of peripheral vasoconstrictor tone.\r"

Nicotine (5 micrograms/kg i.c.) elicited a biphasic response in coronary blood flow consisting of an initial vasoconstriction (phase 1; blood flow fell by 52 +/- 5.4% from a baseline of 66 +/- 7.5 ml/min) followed by vasodilation (phase 2, blood flow rose 119 +/- 12.7% above baseline). The change in coronary blood flow with nicotine was not associated with changes in LV systolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, or heart rate. The change in coronary blood flow was unaffected by combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin, rauwolscine, and propranolol but was abolished by either muscarinic blockade with atropine or ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. Acetylcholine (0.5 microgram/kg i.c.), without affecting mean arterial pressure, elicited changes in coronary blood flow similar to those observed with nicotine, producing an initial phase of coronary vasoconstriction (blood flow fell by 71 +/- 4.9%) followed by vasodilation (blood flow rose by 228 +/- 20.7%). Both phases of the response to acetylcholine were abolished by muscarinic blockade but were unaffected by ganglionic blockade. When nicotine was injected into the left circumflex coronary artery, no change in blood flow was observed in the left anterior descending coronary artery, indicating the lack of involvement of global reflex pathways. These results suggest that nicotine locally stimulates parasympathetic nerves, which constrict the coronary circulation via a muscarinic mechanism.\r"

In the guinea pig, we confirm there is no in vitro contractile force development in bioassay systems using isolated hearts or left atrial tissue in response to angiotensin peptides. However, 125I-angiotensin II binding sites that have the characteristics of a membrane receptor were identified in ventricular (myocardial) and atrial membrane preparations from guinea pigs. In ventricles, saturation-binding data yielded an optimal fit to a two-site model with a high-affinity site Kd1 = 3.6 +/- 0.7 nM and a low-affinity site Kd2 = 433 +/- 126 nM and binding capacities of 66 +/- 10 and 821 +/- 49 fmol/mg protein, respectively. In atria, saturation binding data yielded an optimal fit to a two-site model with a high-affinity site Kd1 = 1.6 nM and a low-affinity site Kd2 = 300 nM and capacities of 145 and 752 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The ventricular binding of 125I-angiotensin II was stimulated approximately twofold in the presence of the divalent cations calcium and magnesium (10 mM). Nonhydrolyzable analogues of guanosine triphosphate increased the dissociation rate of the bound 125I-angiotensin II and decreased hormone binding to the receptor at equilibrium. Competition for 125I-angiotensin II binding by an agonist-antagonist analogue series correlated with previous studies obtained in the rabbit, a mammal in which inotropic responses to angiotensin II were demonstrated. The data indicate the presence of angiotensin II myocardial and atrial receptors and a G-type coupling protein in guinea pig. Although this species lacks an inotropic response to angiotensin peptides, there is a dose-dependent increase in inositol-1-phosphate production in response to angiotensin II, and this response is blocked by the selective angiotensin II antagonist [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When whole heart ischemia was maintained for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C, diabetic hearts recovered 100% whereas hearts from normal animals recovered 30% of their preischemic function. Reperfusion Ca2+ uptake was about 2.5 microM/g dry wt in diabetic hearts compared with 10 microM/g dry wt in control hearts. When the ischemic period was extended to 40, 50, and 60 minutes, diabetic hearts had depressed recovery of ventricular function, and greater Ca2+ overload but reperfusion function was still significantly higher and Ca2+ overload significantly less than in control hearts. Depressed function and increased Ca2+ uptake were both linearly related to low tissue levels of residual high energy phosphates and inversely related to the amount of lactate that accumulated in the tissue during ischemia. However, regression lines relating these metabolic changes to depressed function and increased Ca2+ uptake showed that for any level of residual high energy phosphate or ischemic lactate, diabetic hearts performed much better and had less Ca2+ uptake than control hearts. These effects of diabetes were due to the diabetogenic action of the drugs used since both streptozotocin and alloxan had the same effect and in vivo insulin treatment reversed the effect. Diabetic hearts had a reduced maximum inotropic effect to increased extracellular Ca2+ under control aerobic perfusion conditions. The improved recovery of ventricular function during reperfusion of ischemic hearts from diabetic animals was highly correlated with reduced Ca2+ uptake, and regression lines relating depressed ventricular function to Ca2+ overload showed that data from control and diabetic hearts fell on the same line; that is, when depressed function occurred it was related to increased Ca2+ uptake to the same extent in both control and diabetic hearts. The resistance to ischemia in diabetic hearts was not related to higher tissue levels of high energy phosphates during reperfusion nor to lactate accumulation during ischemia. The observations suggest a role of increased reperfusion Ca2+ influx in ischemic damage and that alterations of sarcolemmal Ca2+ transport systems in diabetic myocardium may account for the greater resistance of these hearts to ischemia.\r"

Under control conditions, myocardial lymph flow rate was significantly higher in the hypertensive group while no difference could be demonstrated in CL/CP between the two groups. This is indicative of either a change in myocardial microvascular permeability or an increase in microvascular exchange surface area. Coronary sinus pressure was elevated in both groups in order to increase transmicrovascular fluid flux and determine the filtration-independent reflection coefficient (sigma) for each group. Sigma is a surface area-independent indicator of microvascular permeability when determined for specific protein molecules at high transmicrovascular fluid fluxes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using saponin-skinned primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle, we investigated the effect of cGMP on 45Ca uptake in monolayers of cells. The intracellular store was loaded with Ca2+ by exposing the skinned cells to a 45Ca-labeled 1-microM free Ca2+-containing solution for varying durations (0-20 minutes). Addition of 10 microM cGMP to six monolayers increased both the initial Ca2+ uptake at 2 minutes (control, 240 +/- 8 pmol Ca2+/10(6) cells; + cGMP 295 +/- 7; mean +/- SEM; n = 6, p less than 0.01) and the final steady-state uptake reached at 20 minutes (control, 0.96 +/- 0.03 nmol Ca2+/10(6) cells; + cGMP 1.12 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.02). This stimulation of uptake was quantitatively similar to that caused by 10 microM cyclic AMP. It occurred at varying ambient cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (0.1-1.0 microM Ca2+) and was not further enhanced by addition of 10 microM cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The dose-response of stimulation of Ca2+ uptake with cGMP indicated an ED50 of 5 nM cGMP. The release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or caffeine was unaffected by cGMP. We conclude that the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle with cGMP-producing vasodilators is mediated in part by sequestration of cytosolic Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\r"

The damaged areas showed loss of staining for alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme present in normal capillary endothelium. Heart performance (cardiac output index, cardiac work [i.e., cardiac output X mean blood pressure], and dP/dtmax) were significantly lower than in control hearts. Capillary density distribution estimated in nondamaged areas of the left ventricular free wall was inhomogeneous favoring subepicardial regions, while homogeneous transmural distribution was found in control hearts. Bradycardial pacing (reduction of heart rate to 50% of normal) performed for 3-4 weeks prior to norepinephrine administration showed a protective effect against catecholamine damage manifested in a smaller extent of necrosis, in the maintenance of homogeneous transmural capillary distribution in nondamaged areas, and, most importantly, in the maintenance of normal cardiac pump performance at rest and during maximal work in response to acutely administered norepinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "Hearts from rabbits with 8-16 weeks of alloxan-diabetes were compared with hearts from normal rabbits to determine whether diabetic myocardium is more sensitive to ischemic injury. In isolated buffer-perfused hearts, left ventricular developed pressure, diastolic pressure, time to peak pressure (TTPP), time to half-maximal relaxation (RT1/2), and positive and negative dP/dt were measured during generation of left ventricular filling curves before and after 90 minutes of low-flow ischemia. Hearts from diabetic rabbits (blood glucose, 384 +/- 28 mg/dl, mean +/- 95% confidence limits) had left ventricular developed and diastolic pressures similar to normal hearts but exhibited significant increases in TTPP and RT1/2 with decreased positive and negative dP/dt. Left ventricular chamber volume relative to heart mass was greater in diabetic than in normal hearts. Recovery of developed pressure after ischemia was similar in normal (41 +/- 16%) and diabetic hearts (47 +/- 13%). In diabetic hearts during recovery from ischemia, TTPP and R1/2 remained increased compared with normal hearts, with positive and negative dP/dt decreased compared with normal hearts, in proportion to the preischemic differences. After ischemia, high-energy phosphates were depleted to the same extent in normal and diabetic rabbits. In coronary ligation experiments, histochemically determined infarct size in diabetic rabbits after 30 minutes occlusion and 24 hours reperfusion was similar to that in normal rabbits when adjusted for a significantly smaller heart weight and a correspondingly smaller anatomic risk region in the diabetic animals. Thus, despite characteristic abnormalities of mechanical function in diabetic hearts, the severity of injury after ischemia with reperfusion was normal for diabetic hearts.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that stimulation of high-affinity GTP hydrolysis and inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by muscarinic agonists are mediated by pertussis toxin (IAP) substrates (Gi and Go) in canine cardiac sarcolemma. We have now used the pertussis toxin-treated dog as a whole animal model in which Gi- and Go-mediated biochemical mechanisms can be studied. Mongrel dogs were injected intravenously with IAP 48 hours prior to death and isolation of left ventricular sarcolemma. Treatment of the animal in vivo with the toxin prevented subsequent in vitro IAP-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of substrates in cardiac, erythrocytic, and renal cortical plasma membranes, suggesting that ADP-ribosylation occurred in vivo from endogenous substrate. Consistent with our previous results obtained by treating sarcolemma in vitro with IAP, muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of high-affinity GTP hydrolysis and inhibition of GTP-activated adenylate cyclase activity were attenuated in sarcolemma purified from the toxin-treated animals. Proximal to adenylate cyclase, guanine nucleotide regulation of muscarinic receptor affinity for agonists was also abolished in membranes from the toxin-treated animals. In addition, the ability of oxotremorine to attenuate GTP regulation of stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by magnesium ions was abolished in sarcolemma from the IAP-treated dogs. Thus, cardiac sarcolemma isolated from the IAP-treated animals displayed biochemical characteristics of an adenylate cyclase system in which inhibitory regulatory pathways had been attenuated. The cardiac biochemical studies and the in vivo ADP-ribosylation of noncardiac IAP substrates also suggests considerable potential use of this model in the physiological and biochemical study of regulatory mechanisms mediated by GTP-binding proteins in other systems.\r"

  ".U": "88194948\r", 
  ".W": "Prior data pertaining to transient entrainment and associated phenomena have been best explained by pacing capture of a reentrant circuit. On this basis, we hypothesized that rapid pacing from a single site of two different constant pacing rates could constantly capture an appropriately selected bipolar electrogram recording site from one direction with a constant stimulus-to-electrogram interval during pacing at one rate, yet be constantly captured from another direction with a different constant stimulus-to-electrogram interval when pacing at a different constant pacing rate. To test this hypothesis, we studied a group of patients, each with a representative tachycardia (ventricular tachycardia, circus-movement tachycardia involving an atrioventricular bypass pathway, atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter). For each tachycardia, pacing was performed from a single site for at least two different constant rates faster than the spontaneous rate of the tachycardia. We observed in these patients that a local bipolar recording site was constantly captured from different directions at two different pacing rates without interrupting the tachycardia at pacing termination. The evidence that the same site was captured from a different direction at two different pacing rates was supported by demonstrating a change in conduction time to that site associated with a change in the bipolar electrogram morphology at that site when comparing pacing at each rate. The mean conduction time (stimulus-to-recording site electrogram interval) was 319 +/- 69 msec while pacing at a mean cycle length of 265 +/- 50 msec, yet only 81 +/- 38 msec while pacing at a second mean cycle length of 233 +/- 51 msec, a mean change in conduction time of 238 +/- 56 msec. Remarkably, the faster pacing rate resulted in a shorter conduction time. The fact that the same electrode recording site was activated from different directions without interruption of the spontaneous tachycardia at pacing termination is difficult to explain on any mechanistic basis other than reentry. Also, these changes in conduction time and electrogram morphology occurred in parallel with the demonstration of progressive fusion beats on the electrocardiogram, the latter being an established criterion for transient entrainment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We used this effect of heparin for the treatment of patients with stable effort angina. In 10 patients, treadmill exercise was performed according to standard Bruce protocol twice a day for 10 days. A single intravenous dose of heparin (5000 IU) was given 10 to 20 min before each exercise period. Exercise with heparin pretreatment increased the total exercise duration from 6.3 +/- 1.9 (SD) to 9.1 +/- 2.2 min (p less than .001) and the maximal double product (DP) from 18,900 +/- 5100 to 25,500 +/- 6800 mm Hg.beats/min (p less than .001). The DP at the onset of angina was also increased by 35% (p less than .01) and the DP at which ST depression (0.1 mV) first appeared was 19% (p less than .05) greater after treatment. Repeat coronary cineangiography revealed an increase in the extent of opacification of collaterals to the jeopardized myocardium. In an additional six patients, treadmill exercise was performed with no medication twice a day for 10 days. All of the above-mentioned variables of treadmill capacity remained unchanged, despite 20 exercise periods without heparin pretreatment. Thus, heparin accelerates exercise-induced coronary collateral development by promoting angiogenesis. The development of such a therapeutic modality will open a new field for the treatment of patients with ischemia.\r"

First, we wanted to evaluate in patients a technique for automated adjustment of selected energy for defibrillation or cardioversion based on transthoracic impedance. Second, we wanted to define the relationship of peak current and shock success in various arrhythmias. Applying a previously validated method of predicting transthoracic impedance in advance of any shock, we modified defibrillators to automatically double the operator-selected energy if the predicted impedance exceeded 70 omega. Success rates of shocks given for ventricular and atrial arrhythmias from these modified energy-adjusting defibrillators were compared with success rates for shocks given from standard defibrillators. We prospectively collected data on 347 patients who received a total of 1009 shocks. Low-energy (100 J) shocks given to high-impedance (greater than or equal to 70 omega) patients had a poor success rate; in such high-impedance patients significant improvement in shock success rate was achieved by the energy-adjusting defibrillators. For example, when 100 J shocks were selected for high-impedance patients in ventricular fibrillation the energy-adjusting defibrillators achieved a shock success rate of 75%, whereas standard defibrillators achieved a shock success rate of only 36% (p less than .01). Similar improvements were seen for ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Thus, automated energy adjustment based on transthoracic impedance is a beneficial approach to defibrillation and cardioversion. For ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter there was a clear relationship between peak current and shock success.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate this clinical observation, cardiopulmonary response to exercise in 17 asymptomatic patients with no significant postoperative hemodynamic abnormalities was assessed by upright bicycle ergometry according to a modified Jomes protocol 11.5 +/- 1.5 years after Mustard atrial repair. Seventeen age- and sex-matched normal adolescents constituted the control group. Incremental exercise was performed to determine maximum work capacity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and minute ventilation. Cardiac output was computed at rest and during steady-state exercise by a carbon dioxide rebreathing method at 50% of the maximum workload achieved during incremental exercise. Height and weight were similar in patients and controls (p greater than .05). Resting pulmonary function variables were normal in all subjects. At peak exercise, respiratory quotient was greater than 1 in both patients and controls (1.12 +/- 0.09 and 1.09 +/- 0.08 respectively, p greater than .05). Patients achieved a lower peak heart rate (172 +/- 14 vs 185 +/- 11 beats/min, p less than .01), lower maximum work capacity (2.3 +/- 0.6 vs 3.3 +/- 0.7 W/kg, p less than .01). The ratio of minute ventilation at peak exercise to maximum resting voluntary ventilation was normal (less than or equal to 80%) in both groups.

Follow-up status was ascertained for 184 of 203 survivors (91%) at a postoperative interval of 2 to 185 months (mean = 60 months). Significant residual hemodynamic lesions included ventricular septal defect in three, and right ventricular outflow gradient in excess of 40 mm Hg in 24. Reoperation or interventional catheter procedures were performed in 31 of 184 (17%) patients. All postoperative electrocardiograms were reviewed; only two of 184 patients had ventricular ectopy on any tracing. Holter data from 41 patients revealed one with sinus node dysfunction, 12 with Lown grade 1 ectopy, and one with Lown grade 2 or greater. Conduction defects, evaluated by electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic measurements, were not different from those reported for TOF patients undergoing repair at later ages. No study patient received antiarrhythmic medication, although one required a pacemaker for sinus node dysfunction. There were three late deaths, all unrelated to arrhythmia. TOF repair in infancy appears to be associated with an acceptable hemodynamic outcome, and a low incidence of ventricular ectopy and sudden death at 5 year follow-up.\r"

Twelve dogs with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (one-kidney, one-clip model) and 11 normal dogs were instrumented and subsequently studied while conscious. Circumflex pressure, measured with an intracoronary catheter, was adjusted to 100, 75, and 40 mm Hg with a hydraulic occluder that was placed proximally. At each circumflex pressure, myocardial perfusion was measured with radioactive microspheres. Reduction of circumflex pressure over this range did not significantly alter heart rate, left atrial pressure, or arterial pressure. In normal dogs, reduction of circumflex pressure did not alter total myocardial perfusion or the transmural distribution of perfusion. In contrast, in dogs with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, circumflex subendocardial perfusion decreased 46% when pressure was decreased from 100 to 40 mm Hg (p less than .05 compared with normal). Autoregulation was quantified for each third of myocardium with the use of autoregulatory gain values (1 = perfect autoregulation; 0 = the absence of autoregulation). For pressure changes of 100 to 75 mmHg, values for autoregulatory gain were near unity for all layers of myocardium in both groups of animals. When pressure was decreased from 75 to 40 mm Hg, values for autoregulatory gain among the normal and hypertensive groups were, respectively: for subepicardium 1 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE) vs 0.9 +/- 0.2 (p = NS), for the midwall 0.8 +/- 0.2 vs 0.5 +/- 0.2 (p = NS), and for the subendocardium 0.8 +/- 0.1 vs 0.1 +/- 0.2 (p less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PVA represents the total mechanical energy generated by ventricular contraction, which is an intermediate form of energy between oxygen consumption, the total energy input, and EW, the effective energy output. PVA and EW were determined from ventricular pressure and volume, which were continuously measured with a volumetric conductance catheter. Measurements of Ees were obtained by transiently increasing afterload by an inflation of a Fogarty catheter in the thoracic descending aorta. Ea was determined as the ratio of end-systolic pressure to stroke volume. The EW/PVA efficiency of a steady-state contraction increased from 55% to 64%, with a 58% increase in Ees after dobutamine. Ees, which was smaller than Ea before dobutamine, became nearly equal to Ea after dobutamine, maximizing EW for a given end-diastolic volume. EW/PVA efficiency decreased with an abrupt increase in afterload before and after dobutamine. The sensitivity of the decrease in the EW/PVA efficiency to an increase in end-systolic pressure was significantly less after than before dobutamine. We could account for all these changes in EW/PVA efficiency by the relative changes in Ees and Ea in the pressure-volume diagram.\r"

  ".W": "An experimental approach is described to quantitate inhomogeneity in extracellular K concentration ([K+]out) in the presence of ischemia and to relate this inhomogeneity to the electrophysiologic changes. Extracellular potassium concentration and local direct-current electrograms from the same sites were measured in isolated perfused pig hearts with the use of multiple electrodes. Dispersion of [K+]out is described under three conditions: (1) during regional ischemia in the \"central zone\" and the \"borderzone\", (2) during global ischemia, and (3) during perfusion of the heart with a high-K perfusate. Inhomogeneity was greatest during regional ischemia, especially in the borderzone, where generally lower concentrations were measured. When during regional ischemia the normal zone was perfused with a high-K perfusate, dispersion in the ischemic borderzone diminished, and higher concentrations than in the central zone were measured. During global ischemia inhomogeneity was slightly larger than during high-K perfusion. Dispersion during the latter was considered due to experimental error. A decrease in [K+]out during regional ischemia after the initial increase was closely correlated with electrical recovery of the electrograms. This decrease occurred earlier in the borderzone than in the central zone. During ischemia [K+]out was not related to the occurrence of monophasic electrograms, which are indicative of the absence of local regenerative responses. For every single electrode position a linear relationship between TQ depression and [K+]out was found, the slope of which varied with the position of the electrode. When all sites were taken together, there was no correlation between TQ depression and [K+]out. We conclude that: (1) inhomogeneity of K+ is largest in the borderzone, (2) potassium flows from the ischemic zone into the normal zone, (3) transient electrical recovery is related to a decrease (after an initial increase) in [K+]out, which is at least partly due to a flow of K+ toward the normal zone, (4) monophasic (\"block\") electrograms can be recorded from intrinsically excitable tissue, (5) for every single site in the ischemic region there is a linear relationship between local [K+]out and local TQ segment depression, and (6) the degree of TQ depression at a particular site is not a reliable index of the degree of ischemic injury at that site.\r"

  ".W": "Although triggered activity has been identified in isolated atrial tissue with the use of cellular electrophysiologic techniques, there has been no identification of triggered atrial arrhythmias in situ. Moreover, it is unclear whether triggered rhythms of different causes and sites of origin in the heart exhibit uniform responses to pacing that might aid in their identification. We therefore studied arrhythmias induced by overdrive pacing in three canine preparations, and based the analysis of our results on guidelines derived from microelectrode studies. We studied ventricular tachycardias induced by ouabain or by anterior wall myocardial infarction and atrial (coronary sinus) arrhythmias induced by the infusion of epinephrine into the great cardiac vein. In the ouabain and postinfarction preparations, right ventricular epicardial pacing induced ventricular premature beats or tachycardias whose recovery intervals after cessation of pacing shortened and showed overdrive acceleration as pacing rate increased. The first postpacing beat displayed progressive fusion with the paced beats but transient entrainment could not be induced. In the coronary sinus, the recovery intervals of impulses induced by epinephrine and pacing decreased as the drive rate increased, and inducibility of the paced rhythms increased at faster drive rates. Thus, the recovery intervals of triggered activity induced in the coronary sinus are phenomenologically similar to those of infarct- and digitalis-induced triggered rhythms. This is the first demonstration of consistent behavior in response to pacing of diverse types of triggered activity. Considered in light of the failure to induce transient entrainment, the results emphasize the potential utility of pacing in clinical identification of triggered rhythms and their differentiation from reentry.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate autonomic influence on arrhythmogenesis in an animal preparation of triggered activity, we gave increasing doses of cesium chloride (0.125 to 5.0 mmol/kg iv) to 24 dogs distributed equally among four protocols of autonomic intervention: control, total denervation, beta-blockade, and left stellate stimulation. All dogs underwent atrioventricular node ablation followed by ventricular pacing. A left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential (MAP) catheter allowed for detection of \"MAP early afterdepolarizations\" (mEAD). mEAD amplitude was measured relative to MAP amplitude. Cesium chloride (CsCl) increased both MAP duration (132% after 0.125 mmol/kg to 188% after 1.0 mmol/kg; p less than .001) and mEAD amplitude (20% after 0.125 mmol/kg to 49% after 1.0 mmol/kg; p less than .001) in a dose-dependent fashion. All dogs exhibited ventricular ectopy at roughly equivalent doses (0.88 +/- 0.5 mmol/kg). Cesium's peak effect on MAP characteristics, sinus node automaticity, and systolic blood pressure coincided with the onset of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Whereas control and denervated dogs developed VT after similar doses of CsCl (1.21 +/- 0.1 vs 1.12 +/- 0.14 mmol/kg; p = NS), none of the six beta-blocked dogs developed sustained VT. Conversely, those dogs having undergone stellate stimulation developed VT after smaller doses (0.58 +/- 0.34 mmol/kg; p less than .001) and with earlier onset (12 vs 30 sec; p less than .025). After 0.5 mmol/kg of CsCl, left stellate stimulation augmented relative mEAD amplitude compared with control (51% vs 38%; p less than .001), whereas beta-blockade had little effect (39% vs 38%; p = NS). Autonomic intervention as such can affect the arrhythmogenicity of CsCl and similarly alter MAP characteristics. Furthermore, as beta-blockade can prevent sustained arrhythmia without eliminating mEADs, autonomic tone appears to modulate the expression of mEADs as sustained VT.\r"

During ventricular stimulation generating wavefronts conducted along the longitudinal or the transverse fiber direction, 61 unipolar electrograms were recorded with a fine-meshed plaque electrode. Before occlusion, the fastest conduction velocity was consistently found in a direction perpendicular to the nearby LAD segment (longitudinal direction), and the slowest velocity in a direction parallel to the LAD segment (transverse fiber direction). In 3- to 5-day-old infarct preparations, a layer of subepicardial muscle with 1 to 3 mm thickness survived over necrotic tissue. The velocities and directions of fast and of slow conduction measured in ischemic subepicardial muscle were not significantly different from preocclusion values during stimulation at a basic rate, but excitability was found to be depressed in response to premature stimuli. Premature impulses initiated in nonischemic myocardium and conducted into ischemic tissue in the longitudinal or in the transverse directions induced sustained (greater than 100 beats) monomorphic tachycardias during which figure-eight activation patterns were mapped with sock-array electrodes. During these tachycardias, the direction of the common reentrant wavefront of the figure-eight pattern was preferentially oriented along the longitudinal fiber direction, independently of the direction of the initiating impulse. When polymorphic beats were induced, tachycardia terminated spontaneously within 20 beats, or changed to a monomorphic pattern, as described above. In conclusion, the anisotropic organization of surviving subepicardial muscle overlying an infarct provides a spatial constraint that determines a preferential direction of reentrant propagation and may contribute to sustaining monomorphic tachycardia.\r"

Recordings were made from left ventricular epicardium in open-chest dogs during steady-state pacing at CLs from 220 to 600 msec both before and after therapeutic intravenous administration of quinidine. During baseline both APD at 90% repolarization (APD90) and ERP were linearly correlated to CL with nearly identical slopes: y = 0.24x CL + 83.0 (r = 1.0; p less than .0001) for APD90 and y = 0.22x CL + 82.3 (r = 1.0; p less than .0001) for ERP. Expressed in percent repolarization, ERP coincided with a repolarization level of 79% to 83%, with no appreciable influence of CL on this relationship. Quinidine increased APD90 by a small but significant amount (8 to 12 msec), which was independent of CL. In contrast, the effect on ERP of quinidine exhibited marked frequency dependence (p less than .0002), producing progressively greater ERP increase at shorter CLs, as compared with both baseline ERP and concomitant APD90. The duration by which ERP exceeded APD90 reached 44 +/- 14 msec at a CL of 220 msec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We previously developed a cross-sectional echocardiographic technique for quantitatively mapping the endocardial surface of the left ventricle and on which regions of abnormal wall motion can be superimposed in their correct spatial distribution. This endocardial mapping technique (EMT) provides a measure of the left ventricular endocardial surface area (ESA in cm2), the area of abnormal wall motion (AWM in cm2), and the overall percent dysfunction (%AWM) as a measure of the functional \"infarct size.\" To test this approach, we compared the EMT measurements with the actual endocardial surface area (in cm2) and pathologic infarct size (both percent infarct by volume and percent endocardial surface overlying infarct) measured at later autopsy in 20 adults (14 men, six women) ranging in age from 47 to 76 years (mean 64 +/- 9.6 years). The median interval from echocardiographic study to death was 19 days (range 1 to 269 days). Patients were divided into two groups based on the age of their infarcts at the time of death: (1) recent (infarct age less than 14 days; mean age 5.3 +/- 4.6 days) and (2) old (infarct age greater than 6 months; mean age 3.6 +/- 3 years). When the left ventricular endocardial surface area at autopsy was compared with the EMT-derived ESA, a close correlation was found (EMT area = 1.17 X autopsy area + 20.4; r = .94, p = .0001), with the systematic difference in the measurements accounted for by systolic arrest, loss of distending pressure, and specimen shrinkage. The echocardiographic measure of infarct size (%AWM) correlated well with the autopsy percent infarction by volume (%AWM = 1.1 X infarct volume + 5.5; r = .82, p = .0001). Similarly, a good correlation was found for the percent abnormal wall motion and the autopsy percent endocardial surface area overlying infarction (%AWM = 0.89 X infarct area - 0.9; r = .89, p = .0001). When the data were examined in relation to the age of the myocardial infarct, the echocardiographic %AWM appeared to overestimate the autopsy infarct size (by percent infarct volume) in the recent infarct group (n = 6), and underestimate the extent in the old infarct group (n = 13). The findings suggest that the EMT will provide a useful quantitative measure of left ventricular endocardial surface area and the extent of ischemic/infarct-related dysfunction.\r"

In the present studies, measurements of systolic pressure in locally cooled fingers were used to address these issues. We found that local cooling produced a marked decrease or loss of the apparent finger systolic pressure in patients with Raynaud's syndrome in whom a standardized vasoconstriction had been induced by body cooling. Abnormal responses were encountered in 109 of 125 patients with secondary Raynaud's syndrome, in 21 of 37 patients with primary Raynaud's disease or the syndrome of uncertain cause, and in two of 63 subjects without symptoms of Raynaud's. These data suggest a high accuracy of the test in patients with secondary Raynaud's syndrome and lower accuracy in those with disease of primary or uncertain cause. We studied responses of systolic pressures to alterations in body and local temperatures in fingers with and without low pressures secondary to proximal arterial obstruction. Our data show that although local cooling has a small independent effect that increases vascular tone: (1) sympathetic vasoconstriction induced by body cooling is necessary to produce vasospasm and often produces it without local cooling, (2) high local temperature (30 degrees C) protects from vasospasm, and (3) low finger blood pressure predisposes to it. Delayed opening of the vessels observed after sudden deflation of blood pressure cuffs suggests that abnormal responses of finger systolic pressure to cold represent combined effects of high vascular tone, delayed opening, and local blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, the 5-year rate for renal survival, defined as the probability of surviving without hemodialysis, was 37% in all cases. However, there was significant difference in the renal survival between EHT (60% for a 5-year period) and CGN (4% for a 18-month period). Multivariate analyses of the Cox's proportional hazards model revealed that the long-term change in renal function was different between the two groups, namely more rapid deterioration in the CGN group. These results indicate that a long-term prognosis of malignant hypertension is influenced by the underlying diseases and hemodialysis besides antihypertensive treatment may increase survival in malignant hypertension associated with severely damaged renal function.\r"

Antipyrine 1200 mg and rifampicin in two different doses of 600 mg or 1200 mg daily were given orally to each group over a period of seven days. The extent of liver microsomal enzyme induction was assessed by estimating antipyrine elimination, serum gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) activity and the urinary excretion rate of 6-beta-hydroxycortisol. In addition, possible effects on renal enzymes were monitored by measuring gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and beta-glucuronidase (GRS) urinary excretion rates before and after drug administration. The possibility of a direct toxic effect on the renal tubular epithelium following drug administration was assessed by the measurement of urinary beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (AGS) activity, total protein and glucose. Antipyrine plasma clearance and 6-beta-OHF excretion rates increased significantly in the groups treated with antipyrine or rifampicin, while serum GGT activities were enhanced only following antipyrine. Antipyrine administration increased urinary GGT excretion both immediately and one week after cessation of drug administration, but no changes were found following the administration of rifampicin. GRS, AGS, total protein and glucose excretion in urine remained unchanged during and after the administration of each individual drug. Based on these findings, the increased urinary GGT excretion observed following antipyrine treatment may be due to an inducing effect on the renal tubular cells, as no evidence for a toxic renal damage was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A subgroup of patients with steroid-responsive minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is classified as steroid-dependent because of repeated relapses of proteinuria during prednisone taper, or within four weeks of withdrawal of prednisone. The long-term outcome of this subgroup of patients has not been documented. Thirteen patients with onset of steroid-dependent MCNS (biopsy-proven) in childhood have been followed for 10-22 years (mean 15.6 years); 8 patients have been in stable remission for 2-13 years (mean 5.5 years); 3 remain steroid-dependent 12, 18 and 22 years after onset; and 2 had steroid-responsive relapses after 5 and 8 years of remission. In 3 patients steroid-dependent MCNS remitted without cytotoxic therapy 7-11 years after onset. Cyclophosphamide was administered to the remaining 10 patients: 8 had prolonged remissions (1.1-13 years, mean 4.3 years) and 2 relapsed shortly after cyclophosphamide therapy. Of the 8 patients who had prolonged remissions after cyclophosphamide, 3 have had no relapses 5-13 years after therapy. In 5 of these 8 patients steroid-dependency recurred 1.1-3 years after cyclophosphamide and a second course was given, resulting in remissions of 1.4-8 years in 3 patients, change to a frequently relapsing pattern in 1 patient and remission of 3 months in one patient who then became steroid-dependent again. We conclude that the long-term outcome of steroid-dependent MCNS is favorable. Cyclophosphamide is useful in the management of these patients and a prolonged course of alternate-day prednisone therapy after cyclophosphamide may be helpful in maintaining remission.\r"

The cardiac output (CO) was determined by a continuous wave Doppler method. Overall, no major CO changes were seen (7.8 +/- 0.6 l/min post- versus 7.4 +/- 0.5 l/min pre-dialysis). Mean blood pressure rose slightly but significantly from 103 +/- 4 mmHg before to 113 +/- 3 mmHg after hemodialysis (p less than 0.01). Important interindividual differences in the intradialytic evolution of CO were observed. In patients with previous myocardial infarction or dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 12), CO rose significantly from 7.3 +/- 0.7 l/min before to 8.4 +/- 0.6 l/min after hemodialysis (p less than 0.05), while in patients without manifest myocardial disease (n = 6) CO decreased from 7.5 +/- 0.7 l/min to 6.6 +/- 0.9 l/min (NS). Comparison of the evolution of CO in both groups by variance analysis revealed a significant difference (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that, in response to hemodialysis with ultrafiltration, CO probably will increase in patients with myocardial infarction or congestive cardiomyopathy, but probably will decrease in patients without.\r"

After a six-week course of low-dose cyclosporine A, she developed a severe but reversible loss of glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow despite of low cyclosporine A plasma levels. Based upon the observed fall of the filtration fraction, the rise in the relative clearance of 99Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid and the increase in proteinuria, we suggest that in this case the tubules and/or interstitium are the main targets for cyclosporine A nephrotoxicity. Neither our patient's clinical symptoms nor her serologic parameters improved possibly because of the low dosage and/or short duration of cyclosporine A treatment. We conclude that one should be cautious when treating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and pre-existing renal disease with cyclosporine A especially when tubulointerstitial abnormalities are present and/or other nephrotoxic drugs are used.\r"

In the effort to evaluate the effects of protein restricted diet on dyslipidemia, we studied 122 patients with CRF (S-creatinine 1.3-9 mg/dl); 58.2% of whom were on antihypertensive drugs treatment. Patients had been separated into 6 groups: group 1 was kept on a free diet; groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 were kept on a protein-restricted diet from 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 months, respectively. We found hypertriglyceridemia, pathologic levels of esterified cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and pathologic apolipoprotein A1/B ratio in group 1; the comparison with other groups--whose values were normal range after 12, 24 months of treatment--showed significant differences. The lipidic parameters were independent of the duration of CRF and of patients' age. Serum creatinine showed a significant correlation with tryglicerides and HDL-C values only in group 1. Total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were significantly greater in hypertensives than in normotensives. In our opinion, a moderate restriction in protein intake could be effective in preventing and in halting the early alterations of lipid metabolism in CRF.\r"

In patients with \"active\" cellular crescents, increased levels of XLFDP correlated with the percentage of glomeruli containing crescents. Dysmorphic erythrocytes, suggestive of glomerular bleeding, were observed in all of the patients with CrGN, and the urinary red cell counts (URCC) also correlated with percentage of glomeruli containing crescents. The absence of correlation between urinary XLFDP and URCC or urinary protein suggested that lysis of fibrin within crescents may contribute to the urinary excretion of XLFDP in CrGN. The measurement of urinary XLFDP in CrGN is likely to be of value in assessing the activity of glomerular lesions but not renal function.\r"

Production of oxygen radicals was monitored by luminol and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). During dialysis with CU and PC, cells remaining in circulation at the maximum neutropenia showed a significant decrease of luminol-enhanced CL, whether stimulated with opsonized zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate. This defect was transient and the responses normalized at 60 min or upon reuse of the membranes. Among the other membranes tested, only cells collected during the first use of PS showed an impaired CL response to phorbol myristate acetate, but not to opsonized zymosan. CL again normalized upon reuse. At 5 min of dialysis with each membrane, a plasma factor appeared that was able to stimulate oxygen radical production by autologous dialyzed and control cells. A dissociation between the oxidative responses of dialyzed neutrophils and neutropenia was observed depending on the nature of the membranes, suggesting that neutropenia is a multifactorial process in which oxygen radical production appears as an early disturbance.\r"

Regular hemodialysis was carried out from the 29th gestational week until delivery. A healthy female infant was born weighing 1,095 g at the end of the 36th week of pregnancy. The second patient had an immune complex nephritis with a serum creatinine of 4.2 mg/100 ml and a Ccr of 18 ml/min. Hemodialysis was performed regularly from the 13th gestational week until the 37th week and stopped when normal labor developed and a healthy female infant weighing 2,145 g was born. We believe that the early initiation of regular hemodialysis in these 2 patients contributed significantly to the successful outcome of their pregnancies.\r"

We must improve those elements within our purview. The prayer of serenity may serve us well: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. In the game of professional liability litigation as played by the rules extant there are clearly winners and losers. The winners are the legal profession, both plaintiff and defense, and the insurers, who in the face of adversity simply increase premiums or withdraw from the market. The losers are the medical profession, the patients for whom they care and, in the broadest sense, our society as a whole. So as not to close on a note of gloom, one last quote. Lawrence H.

  ".W": "As medical technology becomes more and more complex, both the benefits and risks increase. Perhaps we have misled ourselves and, unwittingly, our patients into expecting the perfect outcome by complication-free care. As we learn more about the pathophysiology of disease it becomes apparent that our expectations are unrealistic. In addition, as clinicians we have become more sophisticated about the utility of clinical testing. We have learned that the predictive value of a test is related to its sensitivity and specificity, and to the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. We have also seen that the prevalence of intrapartum asphyxia is low and the prevalence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy perhaps even lower. Therefore, the positive predictive value for an ominous fetal heart rate pattern in a low-risk patient to be indicative of fetal asphyxia is probably quite low, even if confirmed by a low fetal scalp pH. In practical terms, a number of emergency cesarean sections will be done unnecessarily, at least in retrospect. Collectively, society is concerned about the high and rising cesarean section rate, although the individual patient \"knows\" that the \"brain-damaged\" infant can be prevented by intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring and emergency section. The reality is that from the best studies available it has yet to be demonstrated that routine EFM in the low-risk patient has provided a benefit. We continue to imply a benefit by its widespread use and wonder why the dilemma. Should our patients expect less? Should the lawyers expect less? Even our experts can not agree. Good practice is our goal. We can accept nothing less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two of three ARC patients who showed cotton-wool-like spots developed PCP a few weeks after ophthalmoscopic examination. A close correlation between ocular changes and decrease of CD4+ lymphocytes was observed. In our opinion, these ocular manifestations are as useful an indicator as opportunistic infections or AIDS-related neoplasias in the prognosis of HIV infection.\r"

PaCO2 decreased (mean decrease 6%, p less than .01); there was a major increase in the ventilatory response to CO2 inhalation during administration of the BCAA solution but not the standard amino acid solution. Increased plasma norepinephrine concentration (mean increase 75%, p less than .001) during the infusion of the standard amino acid solution but not the BCAA solution suggested increased sympathetic activity. The results demonstrate augmented respiratory effects of amino acid infusions by BCAA enrichment, and a dissociation between the respiratory stimulation, metabolic rate, and sympathetic activity.\r"

A predictive model was developed which incorporated a sequence of probabilities collected over time in the ICU. The results of this study suggest that using serial observations may enhance substantially the usefulness of the MPM as a vehicle for helping families anticipate the patients' likely outcome.\r"

  ".W": "A multicomponent noninvasive monitoring system for high-risk critically ill patients was developed and tested in a series of 58 high-risk surgical patients. The system was comprised of a thoracic electric bioimpedance (TEB) method for cardiac output estimation, laser-Doppler velocimeter for small vessel flow, transcutaneous oxygen (PtcO2) sensor for tissue oxygenation, pulse oximeter for arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2) and finger pressor sensor for arterial pressure. In a series of critically ill patients, this noninvasive system was compared with the widely used invasive monitoring system with systemic and pulmonary artery catheters. Despite theoretical limitations of TEB as a measure of cardiac output, there was a satisfactory correlation (r = .83) of cardiac output measured by thermodilution (TD) and TEB throughout a wide range of severe illnesses. Moreover, changes in TEB cardiac output satisfactorily tracked changes in TD cardiac output (r = .91). There was poor correlation between TD cardiac output and BP or heart rate. The incidence of abruptly changing physiologic patterns was observed with simultaneously monitored invasive and noninvasive systems. Descriptions were made of the central circulation, peripheral perfusion, and pulmonary function; common interactive responses of these circulations were also evaluated. Monitored events defined as abrupt reductions in these variables often occurred from reduced cardiac output, PtcO2 or PtcO2/PaO2 index, and infrequently from unanticipated reductions in SaO2. Recovery from the nadir of the monitored event was associated usually with improvements in flow, PtcO2, or both. Hemodynamic and oxygen transport patterns of a few commonly encountered patterns are described.\r"

This was done as part of a larger study in which an orally active dopaminergic agonist was given on two mornings, once with a standardized breakfast and once fasting, and one morning a placebo was given with the breakfast. The order of days was randomized. Hemodynamic data were obtained over 8 h each day. There were significant changes in several hemodynamic variables after the placebo-food regimen lasting up to 1.5 h: cardiac index rose from 1.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.2 +/- 0.5 L/min.m2 at 30 min (p less than .001) and to 2.0 +/- 0.5 L/min.m2 at one hour (p less than .05); stroke volume index rose from 20 +/- 7 to 24 +/- 7 ml/min at 30 min (p less than .05) and to 23 +/- 7 ml/min at one hour (p less than .05); systemic vascular resistance fell from 1890 +/- 685 to 1534 +/- 497 dyne.sec/cm5 at 30 min (p less than .001) and to 1668 +/- 524 dyne.sec/cm5 at one hour (p less than .05). Mixed venous oxygen saturation was measured continuously in seven patients and rose significantly at one and 1.5 h. We conclude that food ingestion can have a significant effect on cardiovascular hemodynamics and that this effect should be considered when therapeutic effects are to be guided by invasive hemodynamic monitoring in this population.\r"

Recently, a new pulmonary artery catheter with fiberoptic capabilities, which provides continuous mixed venous O2 saturation (SvO2) measurements, has become available and has been found to be helpful in managing unstable patients. To determine the efficacy of this device in predicting early changes in cardiac output, we studied 46 patients catheterized with the opticath and 25 with the standard pulmonary artery catheter; we compared changes in the SvO2 with associated cardiac index changes. We found that small changes (5%) in SvO2 did not correlate well with changes in cardiac output, yet larger changes (10%) in SvO2 seemed to correlate better. More importantly, we found that only 50% of the SvO2 changes predicted anticipated changes in cardiac output. As can best be determined from the limitations of a nonrandomized study, the value of continuous SvO2 monitoring as an early predictor of cardiac output change remains questionable.\r"

Although no hemodynamic changes were observed in group A, systolic BP, mean BP, heart rate, and cardiac output increased significantly in group B. Catecholamine levels and plasma renin activity were unaltered in both groups, as was glomerular filtration rate. Renal blood flow did not change in group A but it increased by 25% in group B. Urine flow, fractional free water clearance, fractional sodium excretion, and fractional chloride excretion were unaltered in both groups. Fractional potassium excretion decreased by 20%, 22%, and 26% at the three infusion rates of prenalterol, respectively. We conclude that prenalterol does not directly influence renal function in the postoperative setting.\r"

Subgroups of MV patients differing significantly (p less than .01) in the median duration of intensive care included the following: a) under 2 years (5 days) vs. older (4 days); b) medical (5 days) vs. all perioperative (3 days); and c) cardiac surgery (3 days) vs. other perioperative (4 days). We found that a) an average of 3.79 PICU beds per million general population (1.39 per 100,000 children under age 18 yr) were occupied daily by acute MV patients; b) the total PICU bed occupancy averaged 7.54 beds per million general population (2.76 per 100,000 children under age 18 yr) or twice that needed for acute MV patients alone; and c) regression equations based on subgroup annual admissions accurately predicted annual variability in acute MV census/day at both the study and a comparison hospital.\r"

The average serum amikacin concentration before dialysis fell 27% after dialysis. The fraction of drug in the body removed only from dialysis averaged 21%.

LV during HFOV was significantly higher than during static inflation, and increased as oscillatory amplitude increased. LV was significantly lower after lung injury for matched HFOV settings, and was not affected by rate. Dissociation of Paw and LV during HFOV is observed implying that mean alveolar pressure (Palv) exceeds Paw during HFOV in this experimental model. The safe clinical application of HFOV may involve measurement of Palv or LV.\r"

Five miniature swine were instrumented for MBF measurements using tracer microspheres. Ventricular fibrillation was induced. After 10 min, CPR was begun with a pneumatic compressor. Measurements of MBF, arterial, and coronary sinus blood gases were made. After 3 min of CPR, each animal received 0.02 mg/kg of E. The measurements were repeated and defibrillation was attempted. During CPR, MDO2 and MVO2 were 0.2 +/- 0.3 and 0.2 +/- 0.3 ml/min/100 g tissue, respectively. The myocardial oxygen extraction ratio (ER) was 94.2 +/- 3.0%. After 0.02 mg/kg of E, MDO2 was 1.1 +/- 1.4, MVO2 was 1.0 +/- 1.3, and ER was 93.9 +/- 0.7% (p greater than .05). There were no successful defibrillations. These data indicate that MDO2 improves slightly during CPR after 0.02 mg/kg of E, but it does not meet the oxygen demands of the fibrillating heart.\r"

By employing serial in vitro spherulin-induced lymphocyte blast transformation (LT) studies in a group of eight severely-ill coccidioidomycosis patients, prognostic clinical data were provided which could not have been obtained from their skin test status alone. Four of the eight demonstrated positive LT responses early in the course of their disease, quickly converted their skin tests to positive, and were cured of their disease. Two patients had negative LT responses until their skin test converted after several months of therapy. The final two have continued to demonstrate negative LT values despite several years of therapy and have experienced exacerbations of their disease when treatment was discontinued. The use of LT data in such patients can be very helpful in guiding therapeutic decisions in this difficult clinical problem.\r"

The patients had asthma due to western red cedar and had bronchial washings done 24 to 48 hours after a mild to moderate asthmatic reaction induced by inhalation challenge. We did not find significant differences in BLPI concentrations in lavage fluid of asthma patients and healthy control subjects. The ratios of BLPI to albumin levels in bronchial washings appeared to be lower among asthmatic patients, but this difference was mainly due to an increase in albumin levels in lavage fluid in asthma. In addition, there were no significant differences in BLPI levels in washings obtained from main and segmental bronchi in both control subjects and asthma patients.\r"

We studied 146 Ethiopian Jewish immigrants (68 males and 78 females), all nonsmokers with no evidence of any chronic disease. The FEV1 and FVC were analyzed separately by sex and age (those less than 25 and those 25 years or more of age). Standard prediction formulae based on height overpredicted the values found by from 15 to 29 percent. Logarithmic formulae based on sitting height provided a good fit for values for children (less than 25 years). Compared to other populations the sitting height-standing height ratio was low for this population, (0.48 vs 0.52) reflecting their relatively long limbs and shorter thoracic height. Our findings suggest that as a guideline, ethnic groups with deviant standing height-sitting height ratios either use ethnic-group specific prediction formulae or derive prediction formulae using sitting height.\r"

The Pimax measured 81 +/- 25 percent of a predicted value in 20 patients with acute bronchospasm (forced expiratory volume in one second, 36 +/- 17 percent predicted). Pimax was related to both hyperinflation (functional residual capacity, as percent predicted) and body weight (subjects were 122 +/- 29 percent ideal body weight), but not to the degree of airway obstruction per se. Furthermore, measurements of axial (craniocaudal) motion of the rib cage and asynchrony of rib cage and abdominal motions during tidal breathing did not correlate with either the degree of air flow obstruction or Pimax. We conclude that little if any respiratory muscle weakness occurs with bronchospasm. Furthermore, Pimax does not correlate with the degree of airway obstruction and does not explain abnormalities of rib cage and abdominal motion associated with asthma.\r"

The third group of nine subjects received a bronchoscopic examination followed by BAL, but with 200 ml of 37 degrees C normal saline solution. Examination in all groups included arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and pulmonary function test (PFT), both pre- and post-procedure. In group 1 there was no statistical difference in the pulmonary function test result after routine bronchoscopic examination except for decrease in PaO2. The results in group 2 showed a statistical difference in both ABG and PFT data, especially PaO2, FEF 200-1200, FEF25%-75%, FEF25%, FEF50%, and FEF75%. In group 3, there was a significant decrease of PaO2 and no significant difference in PFT before and after BAL. From these data we conclude that BAL is a safe examination. However, the administration BAL fluid (BALF) with 25 degrees C normal saline solution can affect the results of the PFT significantly. Much of this adverse reaction can be minimized by using body temperature (37 degrees C) saline solution. At 37 degrees C, the ABG data showed a decrease in PaO2, but pulmonary function was not affected significantly.\r"

We present data from the literature and our own work which demonstrate that the application of the ILO classification to an asbestos-exposed individual can result in a 10 to 20 percent probability of a \"normal\" roentgenographic interpretation in the presence of significant asbestosis at the histologic level, leading to an inappropriate conclusion regarding the presence of asbestosis. In view of the data and statistical analysis presented, we suggest that sole reliance upon the ILO classified chest roentgenogram for determination of the presence of early pulmonary asbestosis in individual cases is inappropriate.\r"

We present two cases in which a neurogenic tumor, with and without significant spinal canal involvement, was diagnosed at thoracotomy after several nondiagnostic procedures. The appearance of the mass on chest roentgenogram can be used to narrow the preoperative differential diagnosis between ganglion-series and nerve-sheath tumors. The utility of computerized tomography of the chest, in addition to the chest roentgenogram, in assessing the bony involvement of the thoracic tumor is illustrated. The role of magnetic resonance imaging is yet to be fully defined in this entity. These lesions may be approached by separate thoracic and neurosurgical approaches, or by a combined, single-staged procedure. These cases and a review of the literature support the use of the single-staged approach.\r"

Recent evidence has demonstrated depressed myocardial function in human septic shock. We analyzed left ventricular performance during volume infusion using serial data from simultaneously obtained pulmonary artery catheter hemodynamic measurements and radionuclide cineangiography. Critically ill control subjects (n = 14), patients with sepsis but without shock (n = 21), and patients with septic shock (n = 21) had prevolume infusion hemodynamic measurements determined and received statistically similar volumes of fluid resulting in similar increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. There was a strong trend (p = 0.004) toward less of a change in left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) after volume infusion in patients with sepsis and septic shock compared with control subjects. The LVSWI response after volume infusion was significantly less in patients with septic shock when compared with critically ill control subjects (p less than 0.05). These data demonstrate significantly altered ventricular performance, as measured by LVSWI, in response to volume infusion in patients with septic shock.\r"

A rapid diagnosis was established histologically in 72 percent of patients, most commonly by transbronchial lung biopsy; cultures were positive in 94 percent of patients while serology was positive in five of six patients. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was a concurrent, often unrecognized, pathogen in six cases. Most patients responded to amphotericin therapy.

We reviewed the clinical records and autopsy material of 68 patients dying with AIDS, 32 (47 percent) of whom had MAC isolated from autopsy tissue. All had postmortem evidence of systemic infection. Eleven (34 percent) had MAC isolated from lung tissue. Little, if any, local tissue inflammation and destruction were associated with MAC infection. Patients with autopsy evidence of MAC infection had a longer time interval from diagnosis of AIDS to death. The infection was detected antemortem in 14 (44 percent), blood culture being the most sensitive means (86 percent yield). Although recurrent fever was noted among both MAC infected and uninfected patients, weight loss greater than 20 lb, weakness, anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea were more frequent among infected patients. Severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and reduced mean CD-4 percentages and CD-4/CD-8 ratios were associated with MAC infection. Of eight patients who had MAC cultured antemortem and received multidrug antituberculosis therapy, none responded clinically, and all but one had MAC isolated at autopsy. Because MAC is associated with significant discomfort and disability, development of more effective treatment regimens could be beneficial for some affected AIDS patients.\r"

Patients were included in the study on the basis of their refractory response to multiple exercise challenges. Incremental challenges with inhaled histamine were performed at rest and 40 minutes after single and paired exercise tests. The geometric mean histamine concentration required to produce a 20 percent fall in FEV1 (PC20) for the challenge after paired exercise test (4.34 mg/ml) was significantly higher (p greater than 0.001) than those for the challenges after a single exercise (1.05 mg/ml) and for the challenge at rest (0.67 mg/ml). There was no significant difference between PC20 values at rest and after a single exercise test (p greater than 0.05). The results show that the response to histamine is reduced during the refractory period following paired exercise test.\r"

We found that CP dilated the bronchi in six asthmatic patients and one normal subject by acting on bronchial H1 receptor. This action is also modulated by the abnormal functions of this receptor-transducer, explaining why CO exerts a tonic effect only in subjects with H hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, as shown by CO and CP + H responses, bronchial histamine seems to be present primarily in large airways and in relatively small amounts. We also found that bronchial H, the abnormal H1 receptor-transducer, and the bronchial caliber are regulated independently of each other. Consequently, this limits the therapy with H1 blockers in asthma.\r"

We also studied disordered breathing during sleep in the obese subjects, and male predominance in abnormal breathing and oxygen desaturation was noted. These results showed that obese female subjects increased their hypoxic and hypercapnic chemosensitivities against their body mass loading, which was not evident in obese male subjects. The relatively depressed chemosensitivities of the latter may be related to disordered breathing and oxygen desaturation during sleep.\r"

Presenting symptoms in the 38 subjects aged 16 to 78 years included cough, wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, and recurrent colds. There was no association between IAR and clinical probability dichotomized as less than or equal to 50 percent or greater than 50 percent (p = .16, Fisher test). The association was no stronger using only subjects in whom the clinical prediction was greater than 67 percent or less than 33 percent.

In the remaining ten patients, there were three chest wall or pleural lesions, two aortic pulmonary window lesions, two right hilar lesions, and three anterior mediastinal lesions. Forty of these 59 patients were ultimately proven to have a malignancy. The diagnostic yield for malignant disease by cytology and histology of PCNA was 97.5 percent (39 of 40). Twelve patients had a final diagnosis of benign disease. The diagnostic yield in benign diseases by PCNA was 91.6 percent (11 of 12). The remaining seven patients do not yet have a final diagnosis, though the clinical course favors benign disease in six of these patients. We attribute the major reason for this high specific diagnostic yield in both malignant and benign diseases to the ability of obtaining histologic specimens for interpretation.\r"

Fifteen patients had an erroneous diagnosis made at first physician visit resulting in a median doctor's delay of 14 months (range, 3 to 24 months) before correct treatment was carried out. Nine of the tumors were localized perianally (ischiorectal space), seven anally, and five in a fistula-in-ano. Tumors localized anally were significantly smaller and had a significantly shorter history than perianally or fistula-in-ano localized tumors (P less than .05 for each localization). Three patients with anal tumors had their diagnosis made accidentally by routine histologic examination of an excised hemorrhoid. First examination revealed distant metastases in 13 patients and follow-up examination revealed regional or distant metastases in seven patients. Modes of treatment were wide local excision (N = 3), abdominoperineal resection (N = 3), colostomy (N = 9), and radiotherapy (N = 2). Twenty of the 21 patients died within 18 months due to the cancer. One long-term survivor was observed; the patient was alive 12 years after local excision of the tumor without evidence of recurrent disease.

Twenty patients with AC tumors had local recurrence, 21 regional recurrence, and 26 visceral metastases. Eighteen patients with AM tumors had local recurrence, five regional, and one brain metastases. The latest recurrences among AC and AM tumor patients were diagnosed 11 and nine years after primary treatment, respectively. The estimated cure rate by the actuarial method after 15 years was 26 percent and 53 percent for AC and AM tumors, respectively. Thus, if recurrent carcinomas of the anus are to be detected early, frequent life-long control examinations are necessary. It is obvious from this study that, in order to reduce recurrent disease of carcinoma of the anus, new treatment regimens must be tried under controlled circumstances. Surgical therapies alone are clearly insufficient in the treatment of carcinoma of the anus.\r"

The early malignant lesions encountered in this study reaffirm the importance of the adenoma-cancer sequence in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancers in man. The malignant potential of flat adenomas is emphasized. The occurrence of small carcinomas without evidence of adenomatous elements raises the possibility of de novo origin as an alternative pathway.

Radiologic series of the abdomen were taken after 200 gm of barium meal. The results showed that the colostomy provided complete diversion of the radiologic contrast in 53 patients (85 percent) and incomplete diversion in nine patients (15 percent). Analysis of the results revealed that incomplete fecal diversion was: 1) observed as of the 86th postoperative day, with a significantly higher frequency following the 10th postoperative month, and 2) significantly correlated with either colostomy retraction or prolapse. The authors present a diagram showing a possible interaction of factors responsible for incomplete fecal diversion in loop colostomy and conclude that: 1) retraction is probably the basic contributing factor for colostomy failure; 2) the prolapse, once reduced, propitiates sinking of the stoma, facilitating colostomy failure; 3) the common assumption that loop colostomy eventually fails to provide complete fecal diversion is further supported; 4) loop colostomy assures, over its usual duration, a satisfactory defunctionalization of the colon; and 5) use of improved techniques of colostomy construction may prolong complete fecal diversion.\r"

The colonoscopist should be aware of this possibility and endeavor to identify the exact location of the ureteric orifices before excision of any polypoid lesion in this situation.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) MB isoenzyme has become accepted as a highly specific criterion for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). A patient with metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the colon who had marked and persistent elevation of CPK-MB isoenzyme, in the absence of clinical and cardiographic evidence for MI, is described. The CPK-MB level was 25 percent (normal, less than 3 percent) on admission, 39 percent postoperatively, and 57 percent on discharge. A prompt decline in serum CPK-MB activity (11 percent, less than 3 percent) paralleled chemotherapy-induced tumor regression. Resurgence of the isoenzyme heralded recurrent disease. These findings suggest that CPK-MB may be a valuable adjunct marker in the diagnosis and monitoring of neuroendocrine carcinomas.\r"
