Serial 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded for 3 hours after treatment and inspected for rapid repolarization changes of the ST segment and T wave. Abrupt electrocardiographic repolarization changes were observed in 106 patients (56%) and were strongly predictive for an open infarct-related coronary artery at a mean of 6 days after treatment (predictive value = 0.92, sensitivity = 0.67). Abrupt electrocardiographic changes were not observed in 82 patients (44%). This absence was not a good predictor of an occluded infarct-related coronary artery (predictive value = 0.4). There was no relation between the presence or absence of abrupt electrocardiographic changes and global or regional left ventricular function after streptokinase treatment. Abrupt repolarization changes after thrombolytic treatment indicate a high probability of an open infarct-related artery. When abrupt repolarization changes do not occur, the patency of the infarct-related coronary artery cannot be predicted with accuracy. Serial electrocardiographic recordings do not provide sufficient information about coronary patency to eliminate the need for coronary arteriography.\r"

More recently, studies have shown that mental stress may also be a cause of myocardial ischemia. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of physical activities and perceived mental states to myocardial ischemia while patients were going about their normal daily activities. Twenty-eight patients with documented coronary artery disease underwent ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram. Physical activity and perceived mental status were recorded by patients in a diary which was then graded according to intensity of the activity. Analyses of the continuous electrocardiographic recordings were done separately from the analysis of the diaries. The time of each episode of ischemia, the duration of each episode in minutes and the number of episodes in each 24-hour period were calculated. A total of 372 episodes of ST-segment depression occurred in 912 hours of monitoring. Ischemic events occurring during usual physical and usual mental activities were most frequent (36%). Twenty-six percent of ischemic episodes occurred during increased physical activity, but usual mental activities. Interestingly, 22% of the ischemic events occurred at high levels of mental stress, but low physical activity. Ten percent of episodes occurred during sleep. Although the majority of events occurred during usual daily activities, when duration of ischemia was normalized for time spent in each category, increasing physical or mental activity was associated with an increasing duration of ischemia per unit (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with a myocardial infarction or major surgery within 6 weeks before catheterization were excluded. All subjects were sampled in the fasting state at the time of arteriotomy before systemic heparinization and at least 30 days after discharge from the hospital (mean 275 days) in the free living state. No statistically significant differences were noted in total cholesterol (220 +/- 51 vs 226 +/- 48 mg/dl), triglycerides (191 +/- 77 vs 191 +/- 113 mg/dl) and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (149 +/- 46 vs 150 +/- 43 mg/dl). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol values were significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) in subjects sampled before catheterization than in the free living state (32 +/- 10 vs 37 +/- 10 mg/dl, mean change 14%). Moreover, the frequency of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 35 mg/dl was 77% before catheterization and 44% in the free living state. This effect was neither due to beta-adrenergic drugs nor to the length of time between samplings. In view of these findings, a screening lipid profile for patients with coronary artery disease should be performed in the free living state.\r"

  ".W": "Direct myocardial revascularization surgery using either the saphenous vein or internal mammary artery has become the definitive surgical treatment for coronary artery occlusive disease. Certain patients who have undergone these procedures, however, have recurrent myocardial ischemia due to progression of disease in unbypassed vessels, to obstruction in the arteries distal to the insertion of the bypass conduit, or to disease of the conduit itself. Balloon angioplasty may be used to relieve myocardial ischemia in these situations; however, initial studies suggested a low primary success rate coupled with excessive mortality and morbidity. Improvements in patient selection, equipment and technical expertise now allow angioplasty to be performed in this patient population with results comparable to that in the general coronary angioplasty population. Of the 3,016 angioplasty procedures performed between September 1980 and June 1987, 236 patients had previously undergone revascularization surgery. The primary success rate was 93% (390 of 419 stenoses successfully dilated). Overall, clinical restenosis was observed in 39%, including a 43% restenosis rate in patients undergoing only saphenous vein graft angioplasty. This did not differ appreciably from the restenosis rate in postbypass patients undergoing angioplasty of only native vessels (37%) or internal mammary arteries (42%). Emergency revascularization surgery was required in 7 of 236 patients (3%), each of whom had myocardial infarction. One of 236 patients (0.4%) died. Thus, angioplasty may be used to relieve recurrent myocardial ischemia in patients with prior direct myocardial revascularization procedures with a high initial success rate and acceptable risk. Early (less than 6 months) restenosis is not infrequent and remains the largest obstacle to a satisfactory clinical outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After exclusion of 92 patients with acute myocardial infarction, the mean age of the patients was 57 +/- 12 years, including 727 men (74%) and 255 women (26%). Although there were no differences between groups with respect to anginal symptoms or extent of coronary artery disease, the primary success rate (by lesion) varied according to lesion severity, and was 63%, 78% and 90% for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p less than 0.001). Only 3 patients (1%) with chronic coronary artery occlusion (groups 1 and 2) required emergency surgery because of side-branch occlusion in 2 patients and guidewire fracture in 1 patient, whereas emergency surgery was required in 14 patients (2%) in group 3. Long-term follow-up averaging 19 +/- 11 months was available for 95% of patients. Although the combined likelihood of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction was below 6% for each group at 2 years (difference not significant), the likelihood of death, nonfatal infarction, coronary bypass surgery or repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was higher (41%) in group 1 than in groups 2 (28%) or 3 (28%) (p less than 0.001). Thus, coronary angioplasty can be performed safely and effectively in patients with chronic total occlusion, although neither the primary success rate nor the long-term follow-up are as favorable as in patients with conventional stenoses.\r"

Branch vessels most jeopardized by dilatation generally have a complex plaque that not only involves the target vessel but also extends into the origin of the branch vessel. Branches free of pathology at their origin generally have an exceedingly low incidence of occlusion during adjacent balloon dilatation. Side branches at risk for occlusion should be \"protected\" if the branch vessel is of an important size that could be dilated with a conventional dilatation catheter. The advent of lower profile dilatation catheters and guidewires has provided an opportunity to introduce several pieces of dilatation hardware into the coronary system through a single guiding catheter. Several techniques are described for both \"protecting\" and dilating side branches, either simultaneously or secondarily, after balloon dilatation of a primary vessel.\r"

Twenty-six patients were studied before and after angioplasty, as well as immediately after stent implantation. The stented coronary artery was the left anterior descending artery in 19 cases, the circumflex artery in 2 cases, the right coronary artery in 2 cases and a coronary artery bypass vein graft in 3 cases. After stent implantation, an additional increase in minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the dilated vessel was observed, suggesting that the self-expanding stainless steel endoprosthesis used in this study has a dilating function in addition to its stenting role.\r"

This report reviews preliminary experimental animal data and initial human clinical experience with this device. In our first study with this device, the duration of inflation in dogs was compared with the maximal duration of inflation using a standard angioplasty catheter. Coronary arteriography was performed to demonstrate distal coronary blood flow through the perfusion balloon catheter. Electrocardiographic recordings and repeated left ventriculograms were performed to detect evidence of ischemia during standard and perfusion and balloon catheter inflations. The average inflation time was 3 +/- 1 minute for the standard catheter and 37 +/- 10 minutes for the perfusion catheter. Each dog had evidence of severe myocardial ischemia during standard inflation, yet none of the animals had ST-segment elevation, ventricular arrhythmia or wall motion abnormality during dilatation with the perfusion catheter. In a second experiment, the effect of prolonged balloon inflations (30 minutes) on intimal hyperplasia was evaluated in the rabbit model. Results of this study showed reduction of intimal and medial hyperplasia after 4 weeks in iliac arteries in rabbits treated with prolonged inflations compared with the contralateral vessel in rabbits treated with standard angioplasty. Initial clinical results from patients treated with this new catheter are presented. The availability of an effective autoperfusion catheter should allow for testing the hypothesis that prolonged inflations could alter the acute angioplasty success rate and long-term restenosis rate.\r"

The technique was performed using 7Fr, 9Fr or 11Fr atherectomy catheters. Mean percent diameter stenosis was reduced from 71 to 23%, by removal of 831 atheromatous specimens in 949 passes of the cutting element through 136 stenoses in 61 patients. All specimens removed were sent for histopathologic examination to determine the components of the atheroma removed, which differed for specimens removed from original vs restenotic lesions. Percent stenosis was reduced to less than 45% in 118 of 136 stenoses (87%). Complications included 1 thrombus, which resolved after intraarterial infusion of streptokinase and 1 probable distal embolization without sequelae. Three angiographic dissections occurred without impairment of blood flow. There were no instances of acute occlusion, vascular spasm or vessel perforation. Six-month follow-up angiography was performed showing that patients who had a residual stenosis less than 30% after initial atherectomy had a lower restenosis rate (18%) than patients with initial residual stenoses greater than 30% (52%); this result demonstrated the importance of performing more complete atherectomy. Transluminal atherectomy appears to be an effective, predictable and safe method for removing occlusive atheromatous deposits from peripheral arteries.\r"

This method measures body impedance with a low-level (800 microA) 50-KHz current conducted through the tissues. A linear regression equation was proposed to relate impedance measurements to total body fat. The hydrostatic densitometric method (underwater weighing) was used to validate the proposed mathematical expression. A correlation coefficient of 0.98 between these two methods was obtained. The overall results from this study indicate the usefulness of the BIA method in determining percent body fat in humans provided body fluids are not perturbed several hours before the measurements.\r"

Significant increases in the sum of the absolute and relative concentrations of C10:0, C12:0, and C14:0 fatty acids and significant decreases in the absolute and relative concentrations of C18:0, C18:1, and C18:2 fatty acids were detected on day 4 in both groups (p less than 0.01). Women who delivered prematurely or at term responded similarly in early lactation to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with an increase in the concentration of fatty acids less than 16 carbons in length. The magnitude of this response is highly variable and may be controlled by total energy balance as well as by individual endocrine responses.\r"

Mean postprandial lipemia (measured as the integrated area under the curve of serum triglyceride concentration plotted against time) was 251 +/- 129 mg.dL-1.8 h-1 (2.83 +/- 1.46 mmol.L-1.8 h-1) after the 40-g-fat meal, 503 +/- 233 mg.dL-18 h-1 (5.68 +/- 2.63 mmol.L-1.8 h-1) after the 80-g-fat meal, and 712 +/- 281 mg.dL-1.8 h-1 (8.04 +/- 3.17 mmol.L-1.8 h-1) after the 120-g-fat meal. These data indicate that in normotriglyceridemic men the magnitude of lipemia that follows the ingestion of a fat meal is directly proportional to the fat content of the meal. The results also suggest that the mechanism whereby triglyceride is removed from the intravascular compartment is not saturated by meals containing the amounts of fat typically consumed by men following a Western diet.\r"

Moreover, the four skinfold measurements are similarly related to systolic and diastolic blood pressures and to total serum cholesterol at each decile of skinfold thickness and to a degree that strikingly parallels summed skinfold thickness (sigma sf).

Body-weight reduction and energy intake during the diet period did not differ significantly between both groups. Before weight loss the AO group had slightly greater RMR than the GFO group. After weight loss mean RMR decreased about 10% in the AO group and about 2.5% in the GFO group. Before weight loss DIT was slightly but not significantly higher in the AO group than in the GFO group. After weight loss DIT increased significantly in the GFO group.

The chief substrates were, in set 1, 0.2% pectin (2 g/L) and, in set 2, 0.1% glucose (1 g/L) and 0.1% pectin (1 g/L). Cultures of fecal bacteria and E carotovora grew for 72 h in each of the solutions. By 72 h the fecal flora culture in set 1 cleaved 30% of the possible methoxyl groups on pectin. The fecal flora in set 2 cleaved 90.7% of all possible methoxyl groups. Balance studies suggest that all of the free MeOH comes from methoxyl groups on pectin. This study demonstrates that fecal bacteria are capable of degrading pectin to release MeOH.\r"

The high-fiber diet induced lower fasting blood glucose levels (p less than 0.01) and decreased the ratio of low-density lipoproteins to high-density lipoproteins (p less than 0.025); no difference was found in HbA1c between the two diet periods. Continuous glucose monitoring also showed a difference in fasting glucose levels that remained after identical low-fiber test meals. The incremental glucose responses did not differ. The fasting and incremental postprandial levels of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and somatostatin did not change, whereas the mean triglyceride concentrations were lower after the high-fiber diet. The results suggest a beneficial effect of dietary fiber in the metabolic control of NIDDM.\r"

Absorption of Ca from the two salts was estimated from both the increase in forearm radioactivity and rise in urinary Ca (oral Ca load test). Both measures indicated that Ca was absorbed at least twice as well from Ca citrate as from Ca(H2PO4)2. However, the increment in urinary Ca 2-4 h after the oral load correlated with fractional absorption when only Ca citrate (r = 0.803, p less than 0.02) was ingested. For group comparisons the oral Ca load test is a rough index of Ca availability but cannot substitute for more direct measures of absorption in an individual.\r"

Skeletal maturation was determined by the presence of epiphyseal ossification centers. To evaluate endochondral bone mineralization the appearance of the zone of provisional calcification on the metaphyseal side of the growth plate and the width of the growth plate were observed. Marginal Zn deprivation was associated with delayed skeletal maturation in monkeys up to age 3 y. Defective mineralization of bone was evident in these monkeys up to age 6 mo.

A basal diet and a test food were fed for 3 days to a healthy ileostomate, and the ileal effluent was collected. Dietary fiber intake significantly increased ileal dry matter, ash, protein, and available carbohydrate (total carbohydrate minus dietary fiber) (p less than 0.05). Basal diet, test foods, ileal effluents, and dietary fiber isolates then were fermented in vitro with mixed human fecal microflora for 24 h, and SCFA production (mmol SCFA/g organic matter) was measured.

Therefore, dietary fiber isolates, rather than whole foods, can provide the closest estimates of colonic SCFA production when ileostomates are not available. Test foods significantly changed molar ratios of individual SCFA within the ileal effluent and dietary fiber isolate groupings (p less than 0.05). In view of the different ileal loads arriving in the colon, we conclude that large differences in SCFA production probably depend on the food consumed.\r"

They were divided into three categories of patients operated on 5, 10, and 15 yr ago. The trends of change throughout this period were as follows: 1) The population operated on in the last 5 yr is older, the proportion of males, especially over 70-80 yr old, and diabetics, is growing constantly. 2) The frequency of acalculous cholecystitis and gangrenous changes increase; the same is true for common bile duct pathology and positive bile cultures. 3) There is a marked decrease in hospitalization time, postoperatively, without significant increase in rate of wound infection and thromboembolic phenomena, or mortality. It seems that there is no change in the frequency of gallstone-related pancreatitis and perforations of gallbladder. The same is disappointingly true for positive choledochal exploration index. We think that the subcostal approach, with rational prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotic regimen, contribute to the shortening of hospitalization time and the fixed rates of wound infection and herniae in scar. Prophylactic heparin given subcutaneously seems to avoid possible thromboembolic phenomena.\r"

An abdominal computerized tomographic scan showed an enlarged head of the pancreas but no discrete mass. Superselective abdominal arteriography also failed to localize the tumor. Transhepatic portal vein sampling for VIP and PP showed a large increase in VIP and PP in the veins draining the head of the pancreas, with the highest levels being found at the union of the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein with the portal vein. Surgical exploration confirmed this tumor location and a 2 x 3 cm encapsulated benign tumor was enucleated from the posterior surface of the head of the pancreas. Postoperatively, VIP and PP levels decreased to normal and the diarrheal episodes ceased. This case report demonstrates the usefulness of transhepatic portal vein sampling in localization of VIPomas if other radiological modalities are not helpful.\r"

None of the patients had recognized infections predisposing to reactive arthritis, and the three patients who underwent tissue typing were HLA-B27-negative. A viral infection, including HIV, is a possible cause.

This was a 17.8-fold increase in the infection rate for the exposed group. Three employees infected had evidence of active disease: two had pleural effusions and one had cavitary pulmonary infiltrates; six were asymptomatic. The high rate of infection was associated with inadequate air ventilation and exposure to uncontained infectious aerosol. Preventive therapy with isoniazid, high-change-ventilating systems, ultraviolet radiation, and primary barrier systems are recommended methods to reduce the infection risk.\r"

Fifty percent of these strains were also resistant to chloramphenicol. Most were sporadic community-acquired cases. Clinical characteristics were similar in both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive cases. Those cases with MICs of greater than 1 microgram/ml did not show a response to penicillin therapy. Of nine patients treated with cefotaxime (200 to 350 mg/kg per day) with penicillin G MICs of 0.1 to 4 micrograms/ml and cefotaxime MICs of less than or equal to 0.03 to 1 microgram/ml, seven recovered, one experienced a relapse after 14 days of therapy and the infection was cured with intravenous vancomycin, and one patient died with sterile cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, adults with meningitis due to penicillin-resistant pneumococci may be adequately treated with high doses (around 300 mg/kg per day) of intravenous cefotaxime if MICs of penicillin G are less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. Cases with higher resistance may require another antibiotic such as vancomycin.\r"

During this 16-year period, starting age increased from 47 to 60 years (p less than 0.001), and the incidence of diabetes mellitus and renal vascular disease increased. Survival analysis showed age, renal diagnosis, type of dialysis, and year starting dialysis to be important predictors of survival. There was a fourfold rise in the risk ratio as starting age increased from 25 to 65 years. The risk was 1.5 times higher for those patients who did not start dialysis in 1978 through 1981 than for those who did. Risk decreased fivefold for patients choosing home hemodialysis. Home hemodialysis patients survived longer compared with patients utilizing other dialysis modalities, possibly because of a younger average age and a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus and renal vascular disease. There was greater than a threefold rise in risk ratio with the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus compared with either chronic glomerulonephritis or polycystic kidney disease. Older patients and those with diabetes mellitus formed the high-risk group; these two characteristics have been increasing during the last eight years of the study. It is concluded that although patients with high risk have an increased and a high mortality, overall survival has improved.\r"

Of the 229 patients at risk, 37 (16 percent) experienced one or more unexpected unit readmissions (n = 30) or death (n = 7). In comparison to the patients without such complications (n = 192), these 37 patients differed with respect to age, diagnosis, and severity of illness on admission. In addition, these patients were sicker on initial unit discharge as manifested by higher heart and respiratory rates and lower hematocrit values. On multivariate analysis, age, acute physiology score on admission, and a diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding were independent predictors of unexpected outcome. It is concluded that patients at high risk for unit readmission or unexpected death are distinguished from other MICU survivors on several clinical parameters. Whether such information can be useful in individual discharge decisions is uncertain and requires further investigation.\r"

Maximal inspiratory pressures (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressures (MEP) were measured at the bedside in 23 hospitalized patients with serum phosphate levels less than 2.5 mg/dl, and these measurements were repeated daily during phosphate repletion until serum phosphate levels reached the normal range. A control group consisted of 11 normophosphatemic inpatients. Sixteen of 23 hypophosphatemic patients, but none of the control patients (p less than 0.001), exhibited respiratory muscle weakness, defined as a MIP less than 40 cm H2O or a MEP less than 70 cm H2O. The mean initial MIP and MEP values were also significantly lower for the hypophosphatemic group. A significant correlation existed between initial phosphate level and initial MIP value (r = 0.50, p less than 0.02). With phosphate repletion, mean +/- SD MIP increased from -37 +/- 26 cm H2O to -49 +/- 24 cm H2O (p less than 0.003) and MEP from 60 +/- 20 cm H2O to 69 +/- 19 cm H2O (p less than 0.02).

Before treatment, hypercapnic ventilatory responses were blunted in 10 of 29 patients (34 percent), whereas hypoxic ventilatory responses were abnormal in eight of 30 patients (27 percent). Hypothyroid women and patients with marked pretreatment elevation of the serum thyrotropin concentration (greater than 90 mU/liter) were significantly more likely to have impaired ventilatory responses. In patients with an abnormal pretreatment response, parenteral thyroid hormone therapy (25 to 50 micrograms of L-triiodothyronine or 100 micrograms of L-thyroxine per day for seven days) significantly enhanced hypercapnic (0.75 +/- 0.06 to 1.19 +/- 0.16 liters/minute/mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and hypoxic (93 +/- 12 to 176 +/- 31 liters.mm Hg/minute, p less than 0.05) ventilatory responsiveness acutely. In seven of nine patients with abnormal pretreatment hypercapnic responses, and six of eight patients with abnormal hypoxic responses, normal ventilatory responsiveness was restored after one week of therapy. It is concluded that: (1) a subset of hypothyroid patients have blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and/or hypoxia; (2) hypothyroid women and patients with a serum thyrotropin greater than 90 mU/liter more often manifest this abnormality; and (3) thyroid hormone therapy for one week reverses impaired ventilatory responses in hypothyroidism.\r"

Compared to 25 age-matched control subjects, COPD patients had higher peak pulmonary systolic pressures by contrast-enhanced Doppler (40 +/- 13 versus 22 +/- 5 mm Hg, or 5.3 +/- 1.7 versus 2.9 +/- 0.7 kPa) and ratios of right to left ventricular volume (1.1 +/- 0.6 versus 0.6 +/- 0.1, both p less than 0.05). Defining cor pulmonale as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular enlargement, or right ventricular hypertrophy, 25 COPD patients (75 percent) had cor pulmonale by echocardiography and 13 (39 percent) by clinical methods (p less than 0.05). Nocturnal desaturation was present in only 21 percent of patients. Echocardiographic measurements were similar between patients with emphysema and patients with bronchitis, and between patients with and without sleep desaturation. In patients who have severe COPD without waking hypoxemia, cor pulmonale is detected nearly twice as often by echocardiography as by clinical methods, but is usually not associated with sleep desaturation.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apoprotein concentrations were measured in 169 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), 78 with normal blood pressure, and 91 diagnosed and receiving drug treatment for hypertension. Plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apoprotein B concentrations were significantly higher (p = less than 0.05 to less than 0.001) in the hypertensive group. In addition, the ratios of high-density to low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and of apoprotein A-1 to apoprotein B were significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) in patients with hypertension. The changes noted were independent of differences in sex distribution, degree of obesity, and level of glycemic control. These results indicate that substantial differences in plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apoprotein concentrations are seen when normotensive patients with NIDDM are compared with patients who are also being treated for hypertension, and that all of the changes noted would increase the risk of coronary artery disease in the hypertensive group. Since all patients with hypertension were receiving anti-hypertensive medications, it is not clear if it is hypertension per se, or its treatment, that is responsible for the observed changes in lipid metabolism.\r"

In normal human subjects on controlled salt intake, the basal secretion of vasopressin, indicated by plasma vasopressin levels and urinary excretion of vasopressin, was higher in men than in women and in blacks than in whites. Basal vasopressin secretion also was higher in male than in female rats. This effect was not associated with a difference in the metabolic clearance of the hormone. The sex-related difference in vasopressin release in rats was abolished by gonadectomy and restored by treatment of males with testosterone and females with ovarian hormones. The pressor responsiveness to vasopressin was higher in male than in randomly cycling female rats. Finally, DOC-salt hypertension, which is dependent on vasopressin, developed more rapidly in male than in female rats. Although there was no sex-related difference in the extent to which plasma vasopressin levels were elevated, pressor responsiveness to vasopressin was greater and baroreflex sensitivity was attenuated to a lesser extent in hypertensive males than in hypertensive females. Thus, it seems likely that gonadal hormones play a significant role in cardiovascular regulation.\r"

Therefore, the chronic level to which the arterial pressure is controlled can be changed only by altering this pressure control mechanism. (2) An increase in total peripheral resistance is not sufficient by itself to cause hypertension. The only resistances in the circulatory system that, when increased, will cause hypertension are those along a restricted axis from the root of the aorta to Bowman's capsule in the kidneys. (3) Autoregulation in the peripheral vascular beds does not increase the arterial pressure in hypertension. However, autoregulation can convert high cardiac output hypertension into high peripheral resistance hypertension. (4) In a computer simulation that cannot yet be performed in animals, a simulated hypertension caused by a combination of increased renal afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances has characteristics that match almost exactly those of essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics of rapid or acute resetting of the aortic baroreceptors were studied in anesthetized rats during 30 minutes of sustained hypertension produced by phenylephrine infusion. Two minutes after the onset of hypertension, a resetting of 26% (ratio of change in systolic threshold pressure to total change in diastolic pressure) was demonstrable. This represents 60% of the maximal resetting (43%) observed after 20 minutes. Thereafter, the magnitude of resetting remained stable. Pressure-nerve activity showed a parallel shift after 2 and 20 minutes of hypertension, with a slight tendency to increased slope at elevated pressures, especially in the baroreceptor function curve analyzed after 2 minutes. These results suggest that in rats, no significant difference exists in the time course for resetting of baroreceptor fibers with low vs. high thresholds. In contrast to other studies, reversibility of the resetting process was not complete within 30 minutes of pressure normalization, and the extent of reversal was no greater than 60%. The data of the present study, taken together with those obtained previously after 6 hours of hypertension, suggest that during the onset and maintenance of hypertension in rat, acute or rapid resetting of the baroreceptors reaches its maximum in 20 minutes (40%) and remains stable for up to 6 hours, with no apparent change in the baroreceptor gain.\r"

NaCl-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-R) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats are resistant to the NaCl-induced alterations in blood pressure and central and peripheral noradrenergic activity, suggesting that the alterations observed in the SHR-S during NaCl loading are genetically mediated. The anterior hypothalamus is a major cardiovascular regulatory region, and depressor responses elicited by pharmacologic (alpha 2 adrenoceptor) stimulation of this area are exaggerated in SHR-S fed a high NaCl diet compared with SHR-S fed a basal diet and compared with SHR-R and WKY fed a high or basal NaCl diet. Membrane-binding techniques confirm that alpha 2 adrenoceptors in the anterior hypothalamic area are increased in number in SHR-S fed a high NaCl diet, presumably reflecting upregulation in response to reduced local noradrenaline release. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that decreased noradrenergic activity of sympathoinhibitory neurons in the anterior hypothalamic area may mediate the exacerbation in hypertension that occurs in SHR-S during dietary NaCl supplementation.\r"

Protocol 1 used a 3-day control period with a 150 mEq sodium intake/day followed by 4 days of salt depletion (SD) with a diet providing 9 mEq/day of sodium and furosemide, 1 mg/kg, given the first day and then 3 days of salt loading (SL), during which 25 mL/kg of isotonic sodium chloride solution was given intravenously each day (3.88 mEq sodium/kg/day). In protocol 2, the sequence of sodium intake changes was reversed. For both protocols, sodium balance was calculated by subtracting urinary sodium excretion from sodium intake and expressed in mEq/kg, either positive or negative. In protocol 1, the hypertensives had statistically significant changes in arterial pressure with changes in salt intake, and they also lost more sodium than normotensives during SD. In protocol 2, blacks, both normotensives and hypertensives, had statistically significant pressure changes with both SL and SD, and black hypertensives retained less sodium during SL than either normotensive group. Spearman correlations showed no relationship between sodium balance and mean arterial pressure, suggesting that salt-sensitive hypertension results not from the magnitude of sodium retention, but from the pressor mechanisms evoked.\r"

Hypertensive endothelial injury is the likely cause of the intimal thickening. High K diets prevent wall thickening of small renal arteries and arterioles in hypertensive Dahl S rats and greatly reduce both medial and intimal thickening of the aorta and mesenteric and carotid arteries in hypertensive stroke-prone SHRsp rats. In view of this, it is likely that the low K diet characteristically consumed by blacks exaggerates their hypertensive intimal thickening. A high K diet could possibly preserve these arteries and avert much renal failure.\r"

The precise and direct delineation of intrarenal hemodynamic mechanisms has been possible only by micropuncture techniques. Since these methods can be used only in the anesthetized animal, intrarenal hemodynamic assessment in conscious intact experimental animals or patients with essential hypertension must be indirect. Using indirect methods, calculated pressures in our laboratory have demonstrated differences in intrarenal hemodynamics between SHR and normotensive WKY rats, notably enhanced responsiveness of the efferent arteriole to alpha adrenergic agonist stimulation. When the calcium antagonist diltiazem was administered to the SHR or to patients with essential hypertension, it effected an increased renal blood flow and a well-maintained glomerular filtration rate without hyperfiltration. These indirect data suggest that there may be an efferent arteriolar abnormality in genetically mediated hypertension that may be reversed with certain calcium antagonists.\r"

The microbiologic and clinical cure rates achieved with a 3-day course of butoconazole 2% cream have been comparable with those obtained with a 6-day course of miconazole nitrate 2% cream or a 3-day course of clotrimazole vaginal tablets (200 mg/day). Patients taking oral contraceptives have responded as favorably as those using other forms of birth control or none whatsoever. In addition, both microbiologic and clinical cures resulting from a 3-day regimen of butoconazole 2% cream have been sustained for at least 4 weeks. The high degree of efficacy and safety demonstrated by this short treatment regimen offers an advantage in the management of patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis, many of whom are likely to abandon any therapy as soon as their clinical symptoms have subsided. A clinical assessment of butoconazole vaginal suppositories (100 mg/day) and clotrimazole vaginal tablets (200 mg/day) found that the two therapies were comparably safe and effective when administered for 3 days. The suppository form of butoconazole may offer a valuable therapeutic alternative for patients who wish to use it instead of or in conjunction with vaginal cream.\r"

Results from the questionnaire were evaluated by conventional statistical methods. The issues identified included subspecialties and the further development of our specialty in role modeling, enhanced education for both residents and students, and the recruitment of a higher-quality resident for our specialty. Additional issues included: Were subspecialties a mistake, and have they fragmented our specialty? Some of the results include the following: (1) More than 90% of respondents agree that subspecialties have helped in the development of obstetrics and gynecology. (2) The subspecialties have enhanced our image in medical schools (88%) and in the community hospitals (77%). (3) The education of medical students (73%) and of residents (86%) has been enhanced by the development of subspecialties. (4) As predicted, the subspecialties have fragmented our specialty (69%), but patient care has not suffered. (5) Disagreement is noted between chairpersons and other respondents that a higher-quality resident is going into subspecialties, but all agreed that the improved quality of residents was due to the development of subspecialties. (6) Only 10% of respondents wished subspecialties had never been developed as contrasted to 82% of all respondents who felt they were commendable. (7) If another subspecialty area is to be identified, more respondents prefer reproductive urology than the next two areas combined.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsed Doppler studies of the fetal and maternal circulations were carried out before and after 64 intrauterine transfusions performed on 24 fetuses. A model was derived for the prediction of hematocrit before the first transfusion: Hematocrit = 7.778 - (0.088 x peak velocity in descending aorta) + (0.968 x gestational age [weeks]) - (10.911 if hydrops present) (r = 0.876, p less than 0.0001). An alternative formula, excluding hydrops, was slightly less predictive: Hematocrit = 45.312 - (56.261 x umbilical cord Pourcelot index) - (0.128 x peak velocity in descending aorta) + (1.042 x gestational age) r = 0.822, p less than 0.001). Neither model was accurate in the prediction of hematocrit before second or subsequent transfusions. A third model was derived from second-transfusion data: Hematocrit = 40.524 - (0.045 x peak velocity in descending aorta) - (10.693 x pulsatility index of maternal uterine artery) (r = 0.81, p less than 0.003). However, this model was unable to predict hematocrit before third or later transfusions. No changes in Doppler parameters before and after transfusion were found. We conclude that pulsed Doppler ultrasound may be helpful in the evaluation of isoimmunized pregnancies, in differentiating anemic from normal fetuses. It does not appear to be useful in determining the timing of later transfusions. The lack of change before and after transfusions suggests that these vessels will not provide significant information concerning the effect of rapid volume and hematocrit changes in the fetus.\r"

Fourteen pregnant women, including four with meningitis, who had an enterovirus infection from 16 to 37 weeks of gestation delivered uninfected, healthy infants. Attempts to demonstrate transplacental passage of Coxsackie B-3 or ECHO-11 viruses by use of the dual, recirculating, in vitro perfusion of an isolated placental lobule were unsuccessful even with a maternal virus input of 200,000 median tissue culture infectious doses. This suggests that transplacental passage of virus does not occur readily, and that most neonates of infected mothers will be unharmed.\r"

The estradiol receptor content was determined in 138 of these samples. Ninety-two tumors (52.6%) tested positive for progesterone receptors (greater than 50 fmol/mg cytosol protein) and 111 (80.4%) tested positive for estradiol receptors (greater than 6 fmol/mg). Median follow-up was 27.3 months (range 1 to 152 months). Progesterone receptor status correlated significantly with grade, histology, adnexal spread, age, and recurrence rate in stage I cancer. There was no correlation between progesterone receptor status and clinical stage, myometrial invasion, peritoneal cytology, retroperitoneal lymph node involvement, or spread to the cervix. Estradiol receptor status correlated with adnexal spread and recurrence rate. Recurrence in patients with stage I disease was significantly more common if tumors were negative for progesterone receptor (16 of 43, 37.2%) than if they were positive (four of 57, 7%; p less than 0.001). Recurrence was also more common if tumors were negative for estradiol receptor (seven of 17, 41.2%) than if they were positive (eight of 63, 12.7%; p = 0.02). In recurrent or advanced disease, response to progestin was independent of estradiol receptor content, but tumors positive for progesterone receptors responded significantly more often than those lacking progesterone receptors. Overall survival was superior for patients with progesterone receptor-positive tumors (p = 0.001). Although survival in clinical stages I and II was also superior in patients with lesions positive for progesterone receptors (p = 0.13), there was no statistical difference in survival between patients with progesterone receptor-positive or -negative cancers and surgical stages I and II disease (p = 0.12). Estradiol receptor status had no apparent correlation with survival.\r"

  ".U": "88207466\r", 
  ".W": "A major goal of prenatal cytogenetic analysis is the development of minimally invasive techniques by which all pregnancies may be screened. That nucleated fetal cells exist in the maternal circulation raises the possibility that their cytogenetic status could be determined. However, these cells may not respond to commonly used mitogens. Thus it will probably be necessary to develop methods to analyze nondividing (interphase) cells. We therefore evaluated the use of flow cytometry as a means of determining whether the relative deoxyribonucleic acid content of G0-G1 leukocytes (expressed as the deoxyribonucleic acid index) could be used to verify aneuploidy or other chromosomal abnormalities. Our findings indicate this is indeed possible. We determined that the mean deoxyribonucleic acid index of circulating leukocytes from normal adult men (n = 15) was significantly different from that of leukocytes from normal adult women (n = 15). Similar results were obtained in leukocytes from umbilical cord blood of normal male neonates (n = 15) and normal female neonates (n = 15). Most importantly, values for leukocytes from each of 13 aneuploid individuals fell outside the range of values for leukocytes from normal adults of the same sex.\r"

We investigated its effects on uterine and iliac artery blood flow, blood pressure, and heart rate in 10 acutely instrumented gravid baboons. Amrinone was compared with dopamine, infused systemically or regionally via the common iliac artery. When given intravenously at a constant rate of 40 micrograms/kg/min, amrinone produced a slight increase in iliac artery blood flow but did not significantly alter mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or uterine artery blood flow. Dopamine at an intravenous dose of 40 micrograms/kg/min produced a mean (+/- SD) 49.2% +/- 18.7% increase in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.01) and a 84.2% +/- 56.1% increase in uterine vascular resistance (p less than 0.01), but caused no changes in heart rate, uterine artery blood flow, or iliac artery blood flow. Regional infusion of amrinone at the rate of 25 micrograms/kg/min produced a significant increase in iliac artery blood flow (p less than 0.01) without changing uterine artery blood flow, heart rate, or mean arterial pressure. Regional infusion of dopamine at concentrations of 2.5 to 25 micrograms/kg/min produced decreases in flow (p less than 0.01) and increases in resistance (p less than 0.01) in the uterine and iliac vascular beds. We conclude that amrinone dilates the vascular bed of the external iliac artery, but has no remarkable effect on the uterine vascular bed. Dopamine increases uterine vascular resistance and may impair uteroplacental perfusion.\r"

Fibroid prolactin antigen in conditioned medium reacted specifically in radioimmunoassay for human pituitary prolactin. Control experiments demonstrated that the radioimmunoassay results were not spurious due to degradation of tracer 125I-labeled prolactin. Immunoparallel dilution curves indicated antigenic relatedness of pituitary and fibroid prolactin. In a calibrated Sephadex G-100 column, fibroid prolactin eluted in the same region (20.3 to 20.9 kd) as purified pituitary prolactin. Glycosylated prolactin, detected by concanavalin A affinity column chromatography, appeared to constitute only a small percentage of fibroid prolactin made in culture. The ratio of fibroid prolactin bioactivity (lactogen Nb2 lymphoma bioassay) to antigen (radioimmunoassay) was 0.77. These data indicate that human uterine fibroid tissue produces a molecule similar to or, perhaps, identical with pituitary prolactin.\r"

Four significant changes were observed in the transition from early proliferative (days 5 to 9) to early secretory (days 15 to 19) phases. These changes included: (1) an increase in the number and size of lamina densa disruptions, (2) an increase in the number and size of gap junctions, (3) an increase in the number and complexity of epithelial cell projections that extended through the lamina densa, and (4) an increase in close contacts between stromal and epithelial cells. The complex epithelial cell projections that extended through the lamina densa were in close proximity to stromal cells. These interactions were seen primarily in the early secretory phase. After that time (days 20 to 28) the interactions were less frequent. These morphologic results reveal complex physical interactions between epithelial and stromal cells of the adult endometrium. The interactions reach maximal development during the preimplantation phase of the endometrial cycle.\r"

Fifty-seven patients had a posthysterectomy complete vaginal prolapse; 38 patients, an incomplete vaginal prolapse; and five, a posthysterectomy enterocele. Fifty-one patients had had an abdominal hysterectomy and 49 a vaginal hysterectomy previously. Almost half of the patients had had at least one attempt at surgical correction of the prolapse and three patients had had four previous procedures. The immediate postoperative complications were not unexpected. Febrile morbidity responding to appropriate therapy was the most common complication. There was no surgical mortality. Seventy-one of the 78 patients were operated on greater than or equal to 1 year ago and were the subjects of the review. Sixty-four of the patients (90%) had complete symptomatic relief after operation. Ten of these patients had some asymptomatic laxity of the vaginal walls and nine others had satisfactory support but vaginal stenosis or symptoms of stress urinary incontinence after operation. Four patients developed cystoceles and three others had recurrent vaginal prolapse. The vaginal approach to the treatment of eversion of the vagina has many advantages, as reported. The surgical goals described were attained; therefore, use of the sacrospinous ligament fixation procedure as a therapeutic procedure only is defended. The surgical technique is described. Finally, the sacrospinous ligament fixation of vaginal vault prolapse should assume high priority in our therapeutic regimen.\r"

  ".W": "Oxytocin concentrations were determined in baboon (Papio anubis) corpora lutea, and the effect of oxytocin on dispersed luteal cell progesterone production was evaluated. Oxytocin concentrations increased significantly from an early luteal phase value of 2.1 +/- 1.1 ng/gm to a peak concentration of 18.1 +/- 4.3 ng/gm wet weight in midluteal phase corpora lutea. Corpora albicantia and ovarian stroma had comparatively low oxytocin concentrations. Reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography of corpora lutea extracts gave a peptide peak (retention time, 17.25 min) similar to a standard oxytocin peak. Plasma oxytocin levels, which were significantly higher in the ovarian vein draining a corpus luteum than in the contralateral side or the femoral vein, declined significantly after luteectomy. Oxytocin was localized by immunocytochemical methods in luteal cells. In the early luteal phase oxytocin (4 to 800 mU; 1 mU is equivalent to 2 ng) inhibited basal and human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated progesterone production by dispersed luteal cells, but in the late luteal phase 200 to 800 mU oxytocin inhibited only human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated progesterone output. Oxytocin did not affect luteal cell progesterone production in the midluteal phase. Thus oxytocin is present in corpora lutea, can be localized in the luteal cells, is probably produced locally, and may modulate luteal cell progesterone production.\r"

The classification is intended to define meaningful clinical categories by which all cases of hypertension and proteinuria occurring in pregnancy, labor, or the puerperium may be classified. New definitions of hypertension and proteinuria are also proposed; they are based on standardized methods of measurement and simple criteria of abnormality. It is hoped that this clinical classification and associated definitions will find general acceptance so that the incidence and outcome of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the results of research in different centers may be compared and mutual understanding achieved.\r"

  ".W": "A study was conducted to determine if invasive cervical cancer diagnosed shortly after negative cytologic test results represents a demographically or epidemiologically distinct subgroup of these tumors. A total of 200 patients with invasive squamous cervical cancer and matched, neighborhood control subjects were interviewed. Cytology reports for smears taken 5 years before diagnosis were obtained, and reportedly negative smears were solicited and reevaluated. Thirty-three patients (group 1) had had one or more negative smears within 5 years and no previous abnormal cytologic results. At diagnosis cancers in group 1 had progressed further than those of patients with nondiagnostic positive smears (group 2, n = 43) but not as far as those of patients with no cytologic tests done within 5 years (group 3, n = 96). Age and social class were the same in groups 1 and 2, but both groups were younger and better educated than group 3. Otherwise group 1 did not differ from the other groups and the same risk factors prevailed roughly equally in all three groups. Therefore cervical tumors diagnosed soon after negative cytologic test results do not appear to differ etiologically from other squamous carcinomas at this site, and the failure of screening to detect these tumors is probably due to rapid progression through the preinvasive stages and/or failure to shed cancer cells in quantities sufficient for detection by routine cytologic screening.\r"

The availability of fetal blood for direct evaluation has changed our attitude about the problems of both hereditary and acquired immune fetal bleeding disorders. We can continue with the classic approach and use fetal blood sampling for those conditions in which termination may be recommended, but we can also investigate less severe disorders in which the diagnosis allows us to plan the management of the pregnancy and minimize intrapartum and neonatal complications. We report our experience in prenatal diagnosis and management of 103 cases of hereditary and 18 cases of acquired immune bleeding disorders. We have developed specific management plans depending on the disorder under investigation, the severity of the condition in the fetus, and parental wishes. We have performed in utero transfusions of platelets and factor concentrate where appropriate. Efficacy of maternal therapy for fetal conditions can be directly assessed during gestation. Mode of delivery is determined by obstetric conditions and fetal status, directly assessed after appropriate therapy. Closer surveillance of the fetus by fetal blood sampling gives precise information on which to base clinical decisions to provide optimal maternal and fetal outcome.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of uterine contractions during labor on both the uterine and the umbilical circulations. Twenty-seven patients in active labor were studied by continuous-wave Doppler velocimetry. Umbilical, left uterine, and right uterine arterial waveforms were obtained before, during, and after peak uterine contractions, and the ratio of maximum systolic and minimum diastolic velocities was calculated. Fifteen patients showed absent flow in end diastole on the uterine artery waveform and had significantly higher intra-amniotic pressures (64.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg) during the peak amplitude of the uterine contraction compared with the 12 patients with maintained end diastolic flow (46.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). During the peak amplitude of the uterine contractions the 12 patients maintaining end-diastolic flow had significantly higher systolic/diastolic ratios in the uterine artery (6.5 +/- 1.5) compared with either before or after a contraction (2.1 +/- 0.15 and 2.0 +/- 0.2, respectively; p less than 0.05). Also, these 12 patients showed a linear relationship between the systolic/diastolic ratio and the intrauterine pressure. However, no differences were observed in the umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratios before, during, or after a contraction in the intensity range studied. On the contrary, during contractions an increase in uterine artery resistance occurs with decreased or absent end-diastolic flow, which bears an inverse linear relationship to the intensity of the contraction. This suggests that during uterine contractions the human fetus continues to have uninterrupted fetoplacental blood flow, whereas the degree of interruption or reduction in uteroplacental blood flow is dependent on the intensity of uterine contraction.\r"

In contrast, 88 patients experienced a significant reduction in B-protein levels measured 90 days after treatment.

In this study population a positive maternal family history was strongly associated with breast cancer: The odds ratio for patients versus controls of having a mother with breast cancer was 3.32 (95% confidence limits 1.64 and 6.72); the odds ratio of having a mother, sister, or maternal aunt with breast cancer was 1.92 (95% confidence limits 1.27 and 2.91). However, family history was not associated with stage at diagnosis, which is the most important survival factor (53.6% of patients with a family history and 51.7% without were at a local stage at diagnosis). Survival was better, although not significantly so, among women with maternal relatives with breast cancer. The relative risk of dying of cancer, adjusted for confounding factors, was 1.40 for women without versus with a family history; the difference in survival was not statistically significant.\r"

Cytotoxic antibodies were reduced in 30% to 42% of serum samples and in 24% to 33% of genital secretion samples. In those couples with decreased cytotoxic antibodies pregnancy rates were 40% to 60% compared with 0% to 23% in those with decreased hemagglutinating antibody titers. Our data suggest that prednisone did not improve overall pregnancy rates; pregnancy rates were comparable in both groups treated with other therapies; donor insemination was the most successful of the alternative therapies; reduction of cytotoxic antibody titers after prednisone treatment was associated with increased pregnancy rates.\r"

We compared the effects of purified porcine relaxin at different concentrations (0, 50, and 150 ng/ml). Parameters include motility, hypoosmolar swelling test, and zona-free hamster egg penetration test. In group A and group B, relaxin increased the results of the hamster egg penetration test and motility. In group C, results of the hamster egg penetration test and motility improved only at the concentration of 50 ng/ml. In group D, relaxin increased the results of the hamster egg penetration test only at a concentration of 150 ng/ml. Results of the hypoosmolar swelling test were not consistently altered in any study group. Relaxin appears to enhance the fertilization capacity and motility of human spermatozoa in oligospermic and asthenospermic subjects.\r"

There was no difference in pregnancy rates between sperm processed with a swim-up in Ham's F-10 or a two-gradient Percoll system. Abnormal sperm penetration assay results in patients with male factor did significantly (p = 0.05) lower the pregnancy rate. It is concluded that if no pregnancy has occurred after six cycles of inseminations, further workup or other treatment may be initiated, but additional pregnancies can be achieved from the seventh through the twelfth cycles of intrauterine insemination.\r"

Since these structures do not grow extensively through the stratum corneum, cutaneous samples may require Gram stain for identification. Since Candida can colonize normal tissue and also be a culture contaminant, clinicians should consider predisposing factors and clinical presentation when making a diagnosis of candidiasis. Predisposing cutaneous factors for candidiasis include occlusion, maceration, and altered barrier function. The hallmarks of Candida infection are bright erythema, fragile papulopustules, and satellite lesions. Cutaneous and mucous membrane candidiasis may differ in appearance, and sexual transmission should be considered. Treatment usually involves a topical or oral anticandidal agent, such as an imidazole. Although implicated as a predisposing factor to candidiasis, mild topical steroids can be used as short-term adjuvant treatment of these infections; when used responsibly, steroids provide antiinflammatory effects that speed relief of patient discomfort.\r"

No significant differences were found between the groups for incidence of nausea or for observer assessment of appearance. There was some evidence of psychomotor impairment at 2 hours in the nalbuphine group. Freedom from Controlled Drug Act regulations and improved analgesia with nalbuphine, render it more satisfactory for day case surgery than the more commonly used fentanyl.\r"

A simple modification of the tests enables their application after nasotracheal intubation; even with small hands, a confirmation rate of 96% in 50 consecutive cases was found. The three tactile tests are reviewed and analysed. In the authors' combined experience of 14 cases of difficult laryngoscopy the tests gave reliable confirmation in 12 patients. Familiarity with these tests is stressed to be important for their reliable implementation.\r"

Possible additive effects of fentanyl and nitrous oxide were also evaluated. Serial SSEP measurements were made before and for 25 minutes after the start of anesthesia. After induction with one of the three intravenous agents, fentanyl (10 micrograms/kg) was administered and SSEPs were again measured 1 and 5 minutes after administration. Sixty-five% nitrous oxide in 35% oxygen was administered after tracheal intubation and was followed by final SSEP measurements. The three intravenous agents affected SSEP signals differently. Etomidate increased both amplitude and latency. Thiopental decreased amplitude and increased latency. Midazolam had no effect on amplitude but increased latency. The addition of fentanyl and nitrous oxide had different effects in response to the three intravenous induction agents. This study emphasizes the differences in SSEP responses not only to different intravenous induction agents but also to the addition of fentanyl and nitrous oxide.\r"

  ".W": "Reductive metabolism of halothane was measured after acute liver injury induced by galactosamine (1.0 g/kg, IP) in rats. On the seventh day of liver injury, when previously elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels had returned to near normal range, anaerobic release of fluoride from halothane by hepatic microsomes, which appears to reflect the reductive pathway of halothane metabolism, was still remarkably decreased (1.36 +/- 0.56 nmol/mg protein/h vs 5.88 +/- 0.58 in controls, P less than 0.001). In another set of experiments, rats (n = 8) given galactosamine 7 days earlier and saline-treated control rats were given halothane anesthesia (1.0%) under mildly hypoxic conditions (F1O2 0.14). In saline controls, halothane anesthesia resulted in a mild but statistically significant increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels (32 +/- 4 vs 59 +/- 6 U/ml, P less than 0.001). In contrast, serum levels of this enzyme were not changed by halothane anesthesia in galactosamine-treated rats (45 +/- 3 vs 49 +/- 4 U/ml). Although care should be taken in extrapolating the importance of these animal data to humans, the results of this study suggest that halothane hepatotoxicity can be attenuated in the presence of minor liver injury as a result of decreased hepatic biotransformation of the anesthetic. The data support the view that halothane anesthesia is not necessarily contraindicated in subjects with impaired liver function.\r"

Both groups showed a decrease in singlet oxygen production as demonstrated using chemiluminescence method. However, 24 hours after the end of surgery singlet oxygen production was fully recovered in the caudal analgesia group (group 1), whereas in the general anesthesia group (group 2), production was still significantly (P less than 0.01) depressed. It is concluded that halothane may be associated with PMNL impairment, perhaps in a time-dependent manner.\r"

Hourly visual analog pain scores were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and time-series analysis. Hourly verbal analog pain scores were used to determine predominant pain levels. According to ANOVA, PCA was no more effective than were IM opioids. Time-series analyses documented a complete cycle of pain every 5.3 hours in patients receiving IM opioids but no pain cycle with use of PCA. Analysis of PCA verbal analog scores demonstrated self-administration of opioids to \"moderate\" levels of pain relief with use of PCA, not to complete analgesia. These results suggest that certain patients may not envision complete postoperative analgesia as being possible. Hence, they self-administer opioids for pain relief with PCA according to their expectations. Population characteristics may modify PCA efficacy. These characteristics should be delineated and the use of PCA targeted to appropriate patients.\r"

Forty healthy laboring women were randomly assigned to two equal groups. Group 1 had epidural analgesia instituted with the bolus injection of 10-15 ml 0.125% bupivacaine containing sufentanil 2 micrograms/ml, followed 30 minutes later by initiation of an epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine containing sufentanil 1 microgram/ml at a rate of 10 ml/hr. Group 2 had epidural analgesia instituted with 10 or 15 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with an epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine begun 30 minutes later at a rate of 10 ml/hr. Infusion rates were altered as required to maintain an analgesic level to the tenth thoracic dermatome. Analgesia assessed by visual analog pain scores was significantly better in group 1. Significantly fewer epidural injections were required in group 1, and less motor weakness occurred in these patients. The addition of sufentanil to epidural bupivacaine infusions given in labor improves analgesia and reduces \"top-up\" requirements.\r"

There was a statistically significant increase in blood and plasma viscosity during and immediately after the end of the videofilm, which correlated with an increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations. This hemorheologic behavior can be explained as a result of an endogenous hemoconcentration that takes place if the Starling equilibrium of intravascular vs extravascular fluid is changed. These observations could lead to new aspects of the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction initiated by severe emotional stress.\r"

The AI was given after three days' treatment with diltiazem (D), verapamil (V), or placebo (PI) in a single-blind fashion. After pretreatment with Pl, serum potassium (s-K) decreased from 3.93 +/- 0.30 mmol/L (M +/- SD) to 3.33 +/- 0.31 (P less than 0.001) with the greatest change 69.75 +/- 46.24 minutes after the start of the AI. Corresponding values for s-Mg were 0.84 +/- 0.06 to 0.78 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.01) and 106.50 +/- 36.71 minutes, for s-Ca 2.40 +/- 0.07 to 2.30 +/- 0.08 (P less than 0.01) and 103.50 +/- 36.06 minutes, for s-P 1.05 +/- 0.17 to 0.91 +/- 0.17 (P less than 0.02) and 80.25 +/- 47.25 minutes, and for s-urate 344.79 +/- 50.55 to 329.26 +/- 47.80 (P greater than 0.05) and 63.95 +/- 46.05 minutes. After pretreatment with D, AI produced similar electrolyte changes as after Pl, but the rise in blood glucose was slightly more pronounced and the drop in s-urate less pronounced. The heart rate (HR) before AI after pretreatment with D was lower than after Pl, but the increase during the AI was of the same magnitude. The AI-induced changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure after D did not differ significantly from those seen after Pl, and neither did QT and QTc, whereas the PR duration was prolonged (0.18 +/- 0.03 second) when compared with Pl (0.16 +/- 0.02) (P less than 0.05). Although the magnitude of the change in DBP was not influenced, V prolonged the time till the lowest DBP (48.95 +/- 26.38 minutes) when compared with Pl (31.50 +/- 29.16 minutes) (P greater than 0.05). The other variables followed the same pattern as for D. In conclusion AI in healthy volunteers produced a drop in s-K but in addition a drop in s-Mg and s-Ca, the latter appearing later than the drop in s-K. Pretreatment with diltiazem and verapamil did not influence the magnitude of these changes but reduced the drop in s-urate.\r"

From the results, it was shown that in PMN-predominant vasculitis, DH reactions were well elicited, whereas in MN-predominant vasculitis, DH skin reactions were somehow impaired. In MN-predominant cases, many OKT3+, OKT4+, OKT8+, and OKM1+ cells were usually seen to surround the skin vessels, whereas in PMN-predominant cases, rare OKT8+, OKT4+, or OKM1+ cells were seen in the dermis. The epidermal dendritic cell system, as revealed by the Na(1)34 monoclonal antibody, was unaffected in both types of allergic cutaneous vasculitis.\r"

The cardiointegram was determined on two resting complexes of leads I, II, V4, V5, and V6 and called abnormal if five of ten complexes deviated outside a normalized template. There was concordance of the cardiointegram and the thallium study in 16 of 20 patients (80%). The sensitivity for the detection of coronary artery disease was 71%, and the specificity was 80%. The overall accuracy was 74%. Thus in patients with normal electrocardiograms, the cardiointegram is a useful noninvasive test for the detection of coronary artery disease.\r"

It is a vasculitic disorder of uncertain etiology occurring mainly in young women and may involve part or most of the aorta, as well as the pulmonary artery. Early features include fever, malaise, weight loss, and a high ESR, and, later on, absent pulses, aneurysms, hypertension, and heart failure may occur.

  ".W": "Electromechanical dissociation (EMD) is an organized electrical depolarization of the heart without synchronous myocardial fiber shortening and, therefore, without cardiac output. Patients in EMD have a poor prognosis for resuscitation and long-term survival. The beneficial effect in resuscitation of epinephrine, the adrenergic agent currently recommended, has been shown to depend on stimulation of alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. The beta-adrenergic inotropic and chronotropic effects of epinephrine are theoretically detrimental by increasing myocardial oxygen consumption and subendocardial ischemia. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the pure alpha agonist methoxamine was superior to epinephrine in human beings in EMD as determined by survival at one hour. These two agents were compared in a prospective, randomized, and double-blinded study involving 80 patients with EMD of various causes seen in the emergency department and internal medicine inpatient service. The advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithm (current at the time of our study) for resuscitation from EMD was used, with the blinded study drug (epinephrine 1 mg or methoxamine 10 mg) administered where the algorithm calls for epinephrine. Calcium and isoproterenol also were used in the majority of cases according to ACLS standards but never prior to the use of methoxamine or epinephrine. Survival data are summarized as: survival less than one hour, 22 patients receiving methoxamine, 22 receiving epinephrine; one to six hours, 15 patients receiving methoxamine, 13 patients receiving epinephrine; six to 12 hours, one patient receiving epinephrine; more than 24 hours but not surviving to discharge, three patients receiving methoxamine, two patients receiving epinephrine; and survival to discharge, one patient receiving epinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Electromechanical dissociation (EMD) has been described as \"organized electrical depolarization of the heart without synchronous myocardial fiber shortening and, therefore, without cardiac output.\" However, little evidence demonstrating this description exists. We wished to determine whether mechanical activity is present during EMD. Twenty-two patients presenting with, or subsequently developing EMD in the emergency department from April 1986 to January 1987 were studied. Echocardiograms were performed during five-second pauses in CPR, using the subxiphoid approach. Nineteen patients (86%) had synchronous myocardial wall motion. In two others, there was a rhythmic change in the echocardiographic density of the myocardium, without visible chamber narrowing. In one there was no visible myocardial response associated with the QRS complex. One or more cardiac valves were visualized in 17 patients. Of these, valvular motion was seen in 15 (88%), but only four exhibited visible valve closure. In our study population, the majority of patients in EMD had myocardial wall and valve motion. Thus, the term \"electromechanical dissociation\" may be a misnomer.\r"

PGE1 was administered as a continuous IV infusion of either 0.1 microgram/kg/min or 1.0 microgram/kg/min starting 30 minutes after the onset of bleeding and continuing until one hour after reinfusion. Hemorrhaged rats treated with PGE1 (1 microgram/kg/min) maintained post-reinfusion mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) at significantly higher values than rats receiving only the vehicle (ie, 0.9% NaCl) (final MABP 84 +/- 3 vs 57 +/- 4 mm Hg, P less than .01). PGE1 at 1 microgram/kg/min also attenuated the increase in plasma activities of cathepsin D (P less than .01), and at both doses blunted the plasma accumulation of free amino-nitrogen compounds (P less than .02 at 0.1 microgram/kg/min and P less than .01 at 1.0 microgram/kg/min). Furthermore, the plasma activity of a myocardial depressant factor (MDF) was significantly lower in rats treated with PGE1 (1 microgram/kg/min) than in rats receiving the vehicle (35 +/- 4 U/mL vs 74 +/- 12 U/mL, P less than .01). Rats receiving PGE1 (1.0 microgram/kg/min) also exhibited a significantly increased survival rate (P less than .01) and post-reinfusion survival time (P less than .01) compared with rats receiving only the vehicle. Our data suggest that antiproteolytic and membrane-stabilizing actions of PGE1 are important and may contribute to its beneficial effects in hemorrhagic shock. Other mechanisms (eg, inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation) may also be involved.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous measurement of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) using pulse oximetry has become a common monitoring and management technique in critically ill hospitalized patients. To determine the impact of SaO2 monitoring on emergency patient management, we conducted a prospective uncontrolled clinical trial on 40 adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute respiratory illness, such as emphysema, asthma, or pulmonary edema. Recorded data included hemograms, arterial blood gases, subsequent therapy, and response to treatment. Additionally, the \"early warning\" capability of SaO2 monitoring was analyzed by recording the severity and outcome of hypoxemic events during treatment. Mean duration of usage for the 40 oximeters in the ED was 1.8 hours; all probes functioned reliably over a wide range of systolic pressures (80 to 206 mm Hg), heart rates (40 to 180 beats per minute), and hematocrits (20% to 58%). There was good correlation between simultaneous pulse oximeter values and both directly measured SaO2 (r = 0.95) and saturations derived from measured arterial PaO2 (r = 0.94). The device detected several otherwise unrecognized drops in arterial saturation that were confirmed by laboratory analysis. Other clinical situations in which the pulse oximeter was found useful in the ED are reviewed. We conclude that continuous measurement of SaO2 can improve the monitoring of ED patients, increase the precision of therapy, detect hypoxemia during intubation, suctioning, and other treatments, and detect clinically unsuspected changes in arterial oxygenation.\r"

  ".W": "Although endotracheal intubation is considered the optimal technique for airway management in critically ill patients, performance of this task in the prehospital setting is at times difficult due to increased masseter muscle tone, vocal cord spasm, or patient combativeness. Use of short-acting paralyzing agents by paramedics to facilitate intubation in these situations is an uncommon practice. We report the recent experience of an emergency medical service system that has used succinylcholine (SUX) for more than ten years. We reviewed prehospital patient intubations for two years; 215 patients were intubated by paramedics without the use of SUX and 95 patients were intubated with the use of SUX. The patient group intubated with SUX was characterized by a greater percentage of women (48% vs 35%; P less than .05), a higher mean Glasgow Coma Scale score (8.6 vs 3.4), fewer intubations for cardiac arrest (3% vs 81%), and more hospital survivors (58% vs 24%; P less than .005). The groups were not different with respect to mean age or frequency of trauma. Paramedics chose to use SUX in 69% of nonarrested patients requiring intubation. SUX-assisted intubation was used most often for the indications of airway protection and respiratory distress. Review of hospital records showed no difference between the groups for frequency of either aspiration pneumonia or mechanical ventilation in patients surviving to hospital admission. No patient receiving SUX required emergency cricothyrotomy, nor was esophageal intubation noted in either group. Succinylcholine-assisted intubation was used safely and selectively by the paramedics in this EMS system to permit airway control and ventilation of patients with more difficult intubations.\r"

  ".W": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is the leading toxic cause of death in the United States today. Unsuspected exposure to this gas will sometimes result in clinically significant, but undiagnosed, toxicity. A high incidence of such unsuspected exposures would make screening for these worthwhile among high-risk populations. We conducted a two-part study to determine the value of screening for unsuspected CO exposure in a population of patients presenting to an emergency department. The first part of our study involved the prospective screening of ED patients using CO breath analysis, regardless of their chief complaint. In the second part, COHGB levels of all patients who underwent arterial blood gas analysis during the study period were reviewed retrospectively. Of 1,038 patients screened by this combined approach, only 29 (2.8%) had abnormal CO breath readings and/or COHGB levels. Of a condensed subgroup of 152 patients defined retrospectively by chief complaint, eight (5.3%) had abnormal values. We conclude that routine screening of ED patients for unsuspected CO exposure is not practical. Although yield increases when patients are screened in a more selective manner on the basis of chief complaint, such an increase still does not appear to justify the screening process.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a study to assess the efficacy of the use of osteophony in the evaluation of shoulder trauma. Evaluation of the shoulder includes the physical examination and often a radiographic series. We studied the usefulness of the olecranon-manubrium percussion (OMP) test, a physical diagnostic procedure performed in shoulder trauma. The bell of the stethoscope is placed over the manubrium, both elbows are flexed at 90 degrees, and the olecranon is percussed. In the normal examination with no disruption of bony conduction, both sides should produce a crisp equal sound. In the event of a dislocation or fracture with disruption of bony conduction, the affected side should be duller in pitch and intensity. We evaluated the utilization of the OMP test to assess its accuracy when used as a screening test for radiographs in conjunction with the physical examination and radiographic examination. Ninety-six patients were prospectively evaluated by the OMP test and also received radiographs. In those patients who had radiographic abnormalities, 40 of 47 (85.1%) had an abnormal OMP sign. In those patients without radiographic abnormalities, none had an abnormal OMP sign. In assessing anterior shoulder dislocations, 11 of 13 (84.6%) had an abnormal OMP sign (P less than .02). After relocation, 100% had a normal OMP sign. Of those with clavicular fractures, nine of nine (100%) had abnormal OMP signs (P less than .005). Of those with a fracture of the humerus, 16 of 20 (80%) revealed an abnormal OMP test (P less than .01). The test was not significant in assessing acromio-clavicular joint abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients were classified as unconscious; impaired; awake, alert, and symptomatic; or alert, oriented, and asymptomatic for pelvic fracture on admission. All underwent a plain anterior-posterior radiograph of the pelvis. A total of 265 patients were studied and 26 pelvic fractures were identified. These occurred in seven of 36 unconscious patients, 11 of 96 impaired patients, and eight of 23 symptomatic patients. No fractures were identified in 110 awake, alert, oriented, and asymptomatic patients (P less than .0001). We conclude that pelvic radiographs are required in unconscious or impaired victims of severe blunt trauma and those with signs or symptoms of pelvic fractures but are not required in the awake, alert, and asymptomatic patient.\r"

An intraosseous infusion was successful in 12 of 15 attempts (80%), and all needles were placed in less than 30 seconds. Drugs administered included phenobarbitol, phenytoin, atropine, epinephrine, sodium bicarbonate, isoproterenol, and pancuronium. Observed complications were limited to minimal subcutaneous infiltration in three cases and slow infusion in another. No serious sequelae were noted, but most patients did not survive and the ability of this study to detect sequelae may be limited. These data suggest that intraosseous infusion is a safe and reliable technique in the prehospital setting. Research is needed to study this technique in more detail.\r"

  ".U": "88208084\r", 
  ".W": "Uncertainty about the existence and duration of a \"golden period\" for suture repair of simple wounds led us to evaluate prospectively the consequences of delayed primary closure on wound healing. Wounds were eligible for study if they were not grossly infected, and had no associated injuries to nerves, blood vessels, tendons, or bone. Three hundred seventy-two patients underwent suture repair; 204 (54.8%) returned for review seven days later. The mean time from wounding to repair for all patients was 24.2 +/- 18.8 hours. Wounds closed at up to 19 hours after wounding had a significantly higher rate of healing than those closed later: 82 of 89 (92.1%) compared with 89 of 115 (77.4%) (P less than .01). Of 23 wounds sutured 48 or more hours (mean, 65.3) after wounding, 18 (78.3%) were healing at follow-up. In contrast to wounds involving other body areas, the healing of head wounds was virtually independent of time from injury to repair: 42 of 44 (95.5%) wounds involving the head and repaired later than 19 hours after injury were healing, compared with 47 of 71 (66.2%) of all other wounds (P less than .001). On the basis of these data we conclude that there is a 19-hour \"golden period\" for repair of simple wounds involving body areas other than the head, after which sutured wounds are significantly less likely to heal, and the healing of clean, simple wounds involving the head is unaffected by the interval between injury and repair.\r"

There was only one operative mortality, and these results coincide with those of the world literature. Follow-up ranges from 1 month to 6 years with an average of 2 and one half years. Seventy-eight per cent of our patients had a good result defined as either Visick class I (ten patients) or Visick class II (four patients). All of the patients, with the exception of the one mortality, had control of the bleeding. Therefore, the authors believe parietal cell vagotomy should be considered in the treatment of acute bleeding peptic ulcer disease.\r"

Median and average incision length was 5.5 cm. There were no major and five minor complications. Recent experience demonstrated safe performance of elective cholecystectomy for chronic disease, regardless of degree of patient obesity, with median incision length 5 cm, median operative time 65 minutes and median post-operative hospital stay 2 days.\r"

The disease can occur at any age, from 3 years to 89 years; the average age is 50 years. Men are affected twice as often as women. The disease most commonly presents as a painful abdominal mass. The cecum is the area of involvement in 70 per cent of cases. The tumors are usually large, averaging over 7 centimeters. The most common histological types are histiocytic or lymphocytic tumors. Surgery is the principle treatment mode; about half are thought to be potentially curable at the time of surgical exploration. The role of adjuvant therapy has not yet been clearly defined, although data from some studies indicate increased survival in those patients given adjuvant radiation therapy. Survival is decreased in patients with tumors larger than 5 centimeters or with histiocytic cell type. Overall 5-year survival is 39 per cent.\r"

Some patients experienced transitory depression of nutrients at six months postoperatively, during the period of most rapid weight loss and lowest dietary intake. These levels return to normal by one year in almost all cases. Low B12 levels were observed in four patients at 1 year. All had been above 120 per cent overweight and had lost in excess of 100 pounds in the first postoperative year. These data indicate that hemic micronutrients remain at normal levels following VBG.

The first part of the study was retrospective and revealed a pre and 24-month postoperative incidence of cholelithiasis of 30 and 40 percent respectively. Age and postoperative interval were not predictive of cholelithiasis. Patients with cholelithiasis had a significantly greater weight loss (130 +/- 61.0 lbs) than those without stones (109 +/- 59.9 lbs) P = 0.04. Men had a significantly greater weight loss than women (160 +/- 15 lbs SEM versus 99 +/- 7 lbs SEM) as well as a higher incidence of cholelithiasis (53 and 24%, respectively). In the second, prospective part of the study, cholecystectomy was performed in 73 consecutive patients concomitant with their bariatric procedure. Ninety six per cent of removed gallbladders had gross or histologic abnormalities including cholelithiasis in 27 per cent and cholesterolosis/cholecystitis in 69 per cent. The incidence of cholelithiasis was higher than that found in the retrospective series by preoperative ultrasound. The bariatric surgical patient is clearly at risk for the development of postoperative cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. The risk appears to be related to the amount of weight loss. In addition, some gallstones may remain undetected at the time of surgery. We therefore recommend prophylactic cholecystectomy at the time of bariatric surgery.\r"

In 1984, the perforation rate was strikingly higher than the earlier years. It was zero in 1944, rose to 13.6 per cent in 1964, and to 31.4 per cent in 1984. One quarter of perforations in 1984 occurred during the first decade of life. In 1984, 14 per cent (10/70) of all patients with appendicitis were examined by a physician prior to eventual hospitalization; nine had perforated the appendix, representing 41 per cent of all perforations. Major factors responsible for the increase in perforations included (1) an increase in patients less than ten years old (a group at high risk for perforation), and (2) physician or patient delay in hospitalization. We suggest that physician and public education, which has proven effective in the past, should be reinstituted. Critical review of appendicitis should be carried out at individual institutions to identify, and thus, modify trends in this disease. Perforation increases morbidity and cost, yet is easily avoidable.\r"

Twelve of 14 patients were in the surgical intensive care unit. Eleven patients had an average of 2.7 major surgical procedures (range 2 to 4); persistent post-operative peritoneal sepsis was common occurring in 9 patients. Bacteremia preceded mixed septicemia in 8 of 14 cases and gram negative enteric bacilli were the most common causes of bacteremia. Fungemia was due to Candida species in 13 of 14 patients and followed prolonged antibiotic therapy. The diagnosis of disseminated candidiasis was suspected during life in 13 patients and proven in six. Mixed septicemia is a marker for a distinct population of critically ill surgical patients with a high overall mortality (78% in this study). Culture of both a fungal and bacterial pathogen in a blood culture, especially if preceded by bacteremia, should alert the physician to strongly suspect disseminated fungal infection and to commence appropriate treatment. Mortality is likely to remain high unless the underlying disease states can be rapidly corrected and infection controlled.\r"

Cautery patients had significantly less operative blood loss when compared with scalpel patients, 352 versus 507 milliliters, respectively, P less than 0.05. No cautery patient required transfusion compared with three transfused scalpel patients, P less than .005. Total postoperative hemovac drainage and hospital stay were not significantly different between the two groups. Although the number of fever days and wound complications were slightly higher in the cautery group, the difference was not statistically significant. The electrocautery may be superior to the scalpel for mastectomy.\r"

Of statistical significance (P less than .01) was that ten of the 14 hernias occurred in the 27 aneurysm patients (37%) and four occurred in the 39 occlusive disease patients (10%). Though a comparison group of aneurysm patients is not available in the literature, the incidence of hernia in our occlusive disease population is consistent with the literature experience when careful long-term follow-up is employed. These observations may represent another manifestation of previously reported differences between aortic aneurysm and occlusive atherosclerotic populations.\r"

This series consisted of 89 patients who underwent surgery over a 6-year period (January, 1980 through December, 1985) at St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center. The patients were separated into three groups: group 1 had elective AAA resection; group 2 had AAA resection and a GI or biliary procedure simultaneously; and group 3 had resection of a ruptured AAA. The patients in groups 1 and 2 were similar with respect to sex, age, surgeons, estimated blood loss, operative time, preoperative risk factors and hospital stay. The patients in group 3 had shorter preoperative and longer postoperative hospital stays, were older, and had greater preoperative risk. The morbidity and mortality of the patients in group 2 were consistently the same or less than that of patients in group 1, even when individual surgeons and preoperative risk factors were compared. The patients in group 3 had a significantly higher morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the literature on management of patients with simultaneous AAA and other intraabdominal pathology and presents a suggested approach to treatment.\r"

Nineteen patients underwent resection of pulmonary hamartomas at North Carolina Memorial Hospital between January 1969 and February 1983, representing 1.9 per cent of all thoracotomies performed for pulmonary disease. Of the 19 patients, there were 12 men (63%) and 7 women (37%), and most were asymptomatic. Chest x-ray demonstrated 12 right-sided and 7 left-sided lesions. All masses were located peripherally in the lung parenchyma and in no instance was calcification present. Fourteen wedge resections and 5 lobectomies were performed. Pathologic examination confirmed the absence of calcification; however, in two cases (11%) an associated malignancy was present. There were no operative deaths and only minor postoperative complications. All problems resolved without difficulty. These data show that pulmonary hamartomas are not commonly associated with calcification, and there may be an increased association with carcinoma of the lung. Excision can be performed with minimal morbidity and is necessary to distinguish hamartomas from malignant lesions.\r"

A rapid spectrophotometric assay has been developed that measures the level of free (unbound) penem antibiotic in serum ultrafiltrates. Whole human serum was adjusted to a standard concentration of antibiotic and then filtered by centrifugation through a Centrifree (Amicon Corp., Lexington, Mass.) filter that retained greater than 99.9% of serum protein. The degree of penem protein binding was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the level of unbound drug in the ultrafiltrate at 322 nm. At this wavelength, no interfering absorption from residual protein was detected in the ultrafiltrate, and penem absorption was linear over a wide concentration range. The method gave protein-binding values comparable to those obtained by a high-pressure liquid chromatography assay but was more rapid, since it did not require solvent extraction and high-pressure liquid chromatography calibration procedures. The spectrophotometric assay has been used to assay over 100 penems to determine the structure-activity relationships that are involved with the high serum protein binding of these agents. As with penicillins and some cephalosporins, the nonpolar nature of the penem side chain at the C-2 position strongly influenced the degree of penem binding to serum proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Forty isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were tested versus oxacillin at 30 and 35 degrees C with and without 2% NaCl supplementation of Mueller-Hinton broth and classified as having resistance that was low (MIC, less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) or high (MIC, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) and temperature or NaCl dependent. Only three isolates had low-grade resistance at both 30 and 35 degrees C; for two isolates the MICs at 35 degrees C were greater than or equal to 4 X the MICs at 30 degrees C. NaCl usually increased the MICs two- to fourfold. Efficiency of plating studies were performed on strains selected for their level of oxacillin resistance and according to temperature-related difference in MICs. Most strains appeared to represent the heterogeneous resistance phenotype. Cefamandole MICs were little affected by temperature but increased with NaCl. With three exceptions, cefamandole MCBs were less than or equal to 4 X MICs. For only six isolates were cefuroxime MICs less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Four strains that were susceptible to both cefuroxime and cefamandole were selected for time-killing curve studies at inocula of 10(7) CFU/ml. At 8 X MIC, cefuroxime failed to reduce the concentration of any strain by greater than or equal to 3 X log10 CFU/ml. Killing of greater than or equal to 3 X log10 CFU/ml was achieved by cefamandole at 4X and 8 X MIC in one strain, at 8 X MIC only in two strains, and by neither 4 X nor 8 X MIC in one strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Carbapenems with 2-substituents containing pyrid-3-yl and -4-yl moieties could be labeled by this method, but those containing a pyrid-2-yl group could not. Nonreversible binding of these labeled carbapenems to human serum albumin was investigated. Pyridinium-3-yl compounds displayed low binding rates (0.028 to 0.044%/h), whereas three of four pyridinium-4-yl compounds bound much faster (0.38 to 0.62%/h). It is postulated that these differences are related to the ability of the compound to stabilize a deprotonated form transiently.\r"

The binding of [3H]muscimol to GABAA sites was also inhibited. These inhibitory potencies differed widely among the quinolones examined. The Dixon plots showed that a newly developed difluorinated quinolone, NY-198 [1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo-3- quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride], competitively inhibits the receptor bindings of [3H]GABA and [3H]muscimol. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the inhibition of GABA binding to receptors (including uptake sites) in the brain may be involved in the induction of epileptogenic neurotoxicities by quinolones.\r"

Examination of the cell envelope of the mutant showed a quantitative decrease in three major outer membrane proteins of 40.6, 39.6 (presumably porins), and 24 kilodaltons and quantitative as well as qualitative modifications in the ladder pattern of lipopolysaccharide. Direct evidence for decreased permeability in the mutant included reduced uptake of [3H]glucose and norfloxacin, reduced accessibility of aztreonam and benzylpenicillin to penicillin-binding proteins in whole cells, and decreased diffusion of lactose and cephaloridine into proteoliposomes that were reconstituted with outer membrane proteins from the mutant. There was also loss of invasiveness of the mutant into HeLa cells. We assume that a pleiotropic mutation was responsible for multiple alterations in the outer membrane components of the resistant mutant of S. paratyphi A.\r"

Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were recovered before the surgical or angioplasty procedure from 74% of patients. The quantitative recovery of methicillin-resistant isolates before cardiac surgery or coronary angioplasty was compared with the number of methicillin-resistant staphylococci detected at the same site 3 days after the procedure. In cardiac surgery patients (who received antibiotic prophylaxis), 17 of the 28 sites (61%) in which low-level colonization with methicillin-resistant strains was detected preoperatively contained high levels of methicillin-resistant staphylococci postoperatively. In contrast, coronary angioplasty patients (who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis) did not have any of the 14 sites containing low levels of methicillin-resistant strains before angioplasty emerge to harbor high levels of methicillin-resistant staphylococci after angioplasty. Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci from each site in which high levels of methicillin-resistant staphylococci emerged postoperatively were paired with preoperative isolates from the same site. Identical antibiograms and plasmid profile patterns were demonstrated for seven of the pre- and postoperative isolate pairs, suggesting that the high levels of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci detected on the skin or in the nares after cardiac surgery were derived from methicillin-resistant organisms present at the site preoperatively in much smaller numbers.\r"

MICs were determined by agar or broth dilution methods. The stability of trospectomycin in the presence of an enzyme extract derived from spectinomycin-resistant Escherichia coli was determined. Trospectomycin was more active than spectinomycin (4- to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus species, Bacteroides species, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium species, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Trospectomycin demonstrated a moderate level of activity (comparable to that of spectinomycin) for most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and was generally cross resistant with spectinomycin. Trospectomycin was susceptible to inactivation by crude enzyme preparations from spectinomycin-inactivating strains of E. coli. Trospectomycin inhibited a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical studies with this novel aminocyclitol antibiotic are in progress.\r"

No differences in amikacin half-life, volume of distribution, total body clearance, or time-averaged peritoneal clearance were noted between the two routes of administration. After a 5-h dwell period, bioavailability as calculated by the area under the curve for i.p. amikacin was 53 +/- 14.0%. Amikacin pharmacokinetics parallel those of other aminoglycosides in CAPD patients when the drug is administered either i.v. or i.p. Single loading doses of amikacin administered i.v. to uninfected CAPD patients provided therapeutic serum and dialysate levels for many aerobic gram-negative organisms for up to 72 h. Because of the variability of absorption of i.p. administered amikacin, single i.p. doses are not recommended.\r"

Pallanza, F. Ripamonti, P. Ferrari, M. Denaro, V. Arioli, and G. Cassani, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 31:1961-1966, 1987). We studied the pharmacokinetics of A40926 in rats after single intravenous and subcutaneous 10-mg/kg (body weight) doses. Concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by microbiological assay. After intravenous administration, high concentrations of A40926, ranging from 132 mg/liter at 3 min to 0.7 mg/liter at 96 h, were found in plasma. Concentrations declined with a three-exponential decay correlated with a prolonged, biphasic distribution and a slow elimination (terminal half-life, 61.22 h). After completion of the distribution, the compound was widely distributed to the extravascular space. The rate-limiting step in the elimination of A40926 from the body appears to be the slow return from the deep compartment into the central one. A40926 was rapidly absorbed from the injection site after subcutaneous administration, and its availability was close to 90%. The percentage of the dose excreted in urine in 120 h was 35.9%.\r"

With the exception of cephalothin, which was markedly toxic to kidney cells in vitro, a good correlation between in vitro toxicity and in vivo nephrotoxicity was obtained, yielding the following toxicity rank order: ceftazidime less than cefazolin approximately cefoperazone less than cephaloglycin approximately cephaloridine. The addition of a kidney microsomal S9 fraction to the cell cultures desacetylated cephalothin as occurs in vivo and detoxified this antibiotic, providing it with the proper toxicity relative to the other cephalosporins. When compared with parent structures, desacetylated derivatives of other cephalosporins such as cephapirin were similarly found to be less toxic to LLC-RK1 cells. The acetylated cephalosporin cephaloglycin was not detoxified by the kidney S9 fraction and was desacetylated three to four times slower than cephalothin by renal esterases. Thus, the rate and extent of desacetylation of cephalosporins may play a role in their in vivo nephrotoxic potential. Our results further suggest that LLC-RK1 cells will provide a useful model for evaluating the potential nephrotoxicity of new cephalosporin antibiotics before in vivo studies.\r"

Ribosomes isolated from adapted and nonadapted cells were equally sensitive to cycloheximide in an in vitro poly(U) translation assay. There was no detectable modification of cycloheximide by adapted cells. Uptake of drug by nonadapted and adapted cells was characterized by a rapid initial accumulation during the first 2 min of incubation with [3H]cycloheximide, followed by a steady-state intracellular drug concentration well below that of the medium. The steady-state drug concentration was approximately 10-fold lower in adapted cells than in nonadapted cells. Treatment of cells with sodium azide or dinitrophenol abolished the difference between uptake of drug by nonadapted and adapted cells and resulted in intracellular drug levels equal to that of the medium. Direct efflux measurements showed that adapted cells loaded with cycloheximide were able to excrete the drug far more rapidly than nonadapted cells. These results suggest that both nonadapted and adapted cells possess an energy-dependent efflux mechanism for transporting cycloheximide and that resistance in adapted cells is due to increased efficiency of transport.\r"

Adherence studies were undertaken with Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 to measure inhibition of adherence to nichrome wires. MICs were determined against selected microorganisms by standard methods. C31G demonstrated broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, with activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and Candida albicans, a yeast. C31G inhibited both glycolysis by salivary bacteria and adherence of Streptococcus strains to wire mesh. C31G was more effective in the assays conducted than any commercial formulation tested and was as effective as chlorhexidine.

Mean concentrations at the end of the interval were not influenced by a multiple-dose administration. The normalized volume of distribution was independent of the dose, with values ranging from 0.16 to 0.19 liters/kg. After multiple administration, carumonam was cleared from the body more rapidly: from 96.2 to 121.7 ml/min after 1 g every 8 h, and from 102.1 to 122.3 ml/min after 2 g every 8 h (P less than 0.05). After 24 h, 75.0 to 80.7% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. The protein binding of carumonam to human plasma remained stable at 28%. Carumonam was well tolerated by the volunteers.\r"

  ".W": "The antiviral activity of 9-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylbut-1-yl)guanine (BRL 39123) was assessed in several animal models of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. BRL 39123 was as active as acyclovir (ACV) when applied topically to guinea pigs with a cutaneous HSV type 1 (HSV-1) infection and was also active topically in an HSV-2 genital infection. Before systemic administration to infected animals, BRL 39123 and ACV were administered orally and subcutaneously to mice, and the blood was assayed for each compound by high-pressure liquid chromatography. When given systemically to mice infected cutaneously with HSV-1, BRL 39123 was as active as ACV. In mice infected intranasally with HSV-1 or HSV-2, single daily subcutaneous doses of BRL 39123 were more effective than equivalent treatment with ACV, reflecting the more persistent activity seen in cell culture and a more stable triphosphate within the infected cell. When the compounds were supplied in drinking water for this infection, BRL 39123 and ACV had similar potencies against HSV-1, although ACV was more active against an HSV-2 infection than BRL 39123 was. In mice infected intraperitoneally with HSV-1, BRL 39123 was 10-fold more potent than ACV and a single dose of BRL 39123 reduced virus replication within the peritoneal cavity more effectively than 3 doses of ACV given 1, 5, and 20 h after infection. Although BRL 39123 failed to eradicate the virus from mice latently infected with HSV-1, treatment initiated 5 h after infection of the ear pinna reduced the numbers of mice that developed latent infections.\r"

At 100 mg/day, peak concentrations of 4.5 to 8.0 and 3.4 to 6.2 micrograms/ml occurred at 2 to 4 and 4 to 12 h, respectively. The mean ratios of the concentration in cerebrospinal fluid to that in serum were 73.8% at 50 mg/day and 88.7% at 100 mg/day. Results suggested that there was a prolonged half-life in both cerebrospinal fluid and serum and that it was slightly longer in the former. Minimal toxicity was noted in 34 patient months of therapy (12 months on 50 mg daily; 22 months on 100 mg daily). After a mean of 4.5 months of therapy, five patients responded to therapy and three were unevaluable. The penetration of fluconazole into cerebrospinal fluid was substantial, toxicity was minimal, and early clinical experience was encouraging. Fluconazole holds promise as the sole or adjunctive therapy for fungal meningitis.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of antimicrobial killing endpoints of Staphylococcus aureus isolates in tube macrodilution MBC testing has been difficult because of multiple technical factors. A total of 41 fresh clinical isolates and 23 reputedly oxacillin-tolerant strains were examined by a modification of the Taylor MBC method. Oxacillin, cephalothin, and vancomycin MBCs were equal to MICs for most strains and were seldom more than fourfold greater than the corresponding MICs after a 48-h incubation. Oxacillin MBC result reproducibility for S. aureus ATCC 25923 and clinical isolates was better than that of cephalothin and vancomycin, and reproducibility improved after a 48-h incubation. Measurement of the percentage of the initial inoculum remaining after 24 and 48 h of incubation for the strains for which the MBCs were highest confirmed improved killing over a wide range of antimicrobial concentrations after a 48-h incubation. Since S. aureus MBC testing is expensive, is subject to error, and almost always gives results equal to the MIC, we suggest that MBC testing is an experimental reference laboratory test that should not be done by clinical microbiology laboratories. Antimicrobial selection should be based on reproducible and standardized MIC tests.\r"

The diffusion rates of various solutes through the liposome membranes reconstituted from the Mr-43,000 outer membrane protein showed the following characteristics. (i) The relative diffusion rates of pentoses, hexoses, and methylhexoses appeared to be about 1.0, 0.6, and negligibly small, respectively. (ii) The diffusion rate of glucose appeared to be about 1/10th that with the E. coli B porin. (iii) The diffusion rate of gluconic acid was five to seven times higher than that of glucose.

Clavulanic acid combined with amoxicillin and ticarcillin and sulbactam combined with ampicillin resulted in synergistic activity against all beta-lactamase-positive organisms. Ceftizoxime was the most active of the cephalosporins. Two percent of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol and metronidazole. Clindamycin resistance was detected in 38% of the B. fragilis group, which is a marked increase from the 4% detected 10 years ago at this institution.\r"

In preliminary studies, the antimicrobial activity of this agent alone or combined with beta-lactam agents against reference strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. cepacia was poor; however, amiloride was markedly synergistic with tobramycin against P. cepacia. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of amiloride-tobramycin synergy against CF respiratory isolates of P. aeruginosa, P. cepacia, and P. maltophilia. The MICs of tobramycin and amiloride alone against the Pseudomonas test strains were determined by agar dilution. Synergy was determined by combining each of four subinhibitory concentrations of amiloride (at least fourfold below the MIC) with doubling dilutions of tobramycin and comparing the MIC of tobramycin alone and in combination for each strain. At the highest concentration tested, the drug combination synergistically inhibited 50% of the P. cepacia strains tested; the combination was synergistic against fewer isolates of P. aeruginosa and P. maltophilia. Only P. cepacia was inhibited by tobramycin combined with amiloride at achievable airway concentrations. We conclude that the combination of tobramycin and amiloride may be potentially useful in the treatment of P. cepacia infections in children with CF.\r"

Therefore, our patient's vascular lesions appear to have been pseudomalignancies. There are no other similar conditions reported in the literature. This kind of disorder demonstrates that vascular tissue can be involved in very bizarre cell and tissue reactions to several stimuli and can mimic malignant neoplasms. We stress the importance of constant surveillance of this kind of lesion to collect adequate clinical data, because histologic findings alone may cause misdiagnosis and lead to treatment hazardous to the patient.\r"

The response rate was 81.3%. Altogether 94% of districts reported screening for both reduced visual acuity and squint; two districts screened for neither. A great variety of different types of tests were in use and screening was carried out at a variety of different ages. A high proportion of districts were screening children for reduced visual acuity in infancy, although screening tests applicable at this age have not been shown to be effective. Districts screened for squint between one and four times. Collection of routine monitoring information by districts was poor.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was conducted of all children admitted to our intensive care unit over eight years with a diagnosis of pertussis that had been proved on culture. Altogether 789 children were seen as outpatients and inpatients. Twenty four of these children were admitted to the intensive care unit, 13 of whom required ventilatory support; two of the ventilated patients died. Intubation and ventilation were usually started for appreciable apnoea. Most patients requiring support were less than 3 months of age and required intervention within the first 16 days of cough. For these patients ventilation was neither difficult nor prolonged. Coughing spasms were not a problem and intubation and ventilation appeared to attenuate the progress of the disease. The presence of severe bacterial pneumonia associated with difficult ventilation requiring neuromuscular paralysis indicated a poor prognosis. It is suggested that intubation and ventilation can be safely used in very severe pertussis infection and, because of their greater risk of hypoxic damage and death, it should not be reserved as a last resort in critically ill infants.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen children aged 6 to 11 years old who fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome were investigated to find out the prevalence of previous and current respiratory symptoms, and abnormal pulmonary function tests, chest radiographs, and ventilation scans. Eleven of the 18 had no respiratory symptoms and eight of these had normal pulmonary function on testing. Two had mild limitation of expiratory airflow that did not respond to treatment with bronchodilators, and one had exercise induced bronchospasm that responded to treatment with bronchodilators. Seven of the 18 had recurrent cough and wheezing compatible with a diagnosis of asthma, and five of these had appreciable exercise induced bronchospasm that responded to treatment with bronchodilators. None of the children with symptoms had a personal or family history of atopy or had had acute bronchiolitis. All chest radiographs were normal. We found a much higher prevalence of asthmatic symptoms and abnormal bronchial reactivity among survivors of neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome than in the general childhood population. Aspiration of meconium may have long term consequences for the developing respiratory tract and is associated with abnormal respiratory function in later childhood.\r"

The data show that the girls were likely to come from homes where the parents were divorced, where the mother married when she was under 21 years of age, and where her first child was conceived out of wedlock. Altogether 76 of these pregnant girls first had intercourse before they were 16 years old. The younger the girl at first intercourse the sooner it occurred in the relationship and for almost half of the girls first intercourse was unplanned. Although almost half used contraception on the first occasion, only one third of the girls used contraceptives regularly. Most expressed the wish that they had delayed intercourse until they were older.\r"

To understand what is meant by the descriptions of crying and fussing in the diaries, the diaries of 10 mothers of 6 week old infants were compared with tape recordings of vocalisations made by the babies over a 24 hour period. There were moderately strong correlations between the frequency of episodes (clusters of 'negative vocalisations') on the audiotape and episodes of 'crying and fussing' in the diaries, and between the duration of episodes on the audiotape and episodes of 'crying' in the diaries. To assess the acceptability of the diaries for recording information for clinical and epidemiological research, they were then used in a population study of a wide socioeconomic group. Usable data were obtained from 91% of the sample. The results suggest that despite pronounced differences between recording methods, these diaries may provide valid and useful reports of crying and fussing in the short term.\r"
