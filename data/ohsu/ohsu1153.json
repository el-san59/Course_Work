  ".W": "The costs and benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) were considered using lifetime lovastatin therapy as the intervention model for adults between 35 and 55 years of age. The analysis projected the benefits of CAD risk reduction using estimates from the Framingham Heart Study. The chosen analytic perspective was that of the patient. For average-risk men with total serum cholesterol levels between 5.69 and 9.83 mmol/liter (220 and 380 mg/dl), the cost per life-year saved ranged from $9,000 to $106,000, whereas for average-risk women, the cost ranged from $35,000 to $297,000 (1989 U.S. dollars). In high-risk men (with smoking habit and hypertension), the cost per life-year saved values ranged from 6,000 to $53,000, whereas in high-risk women the cost per life-year saved values ranged from $19,000 to $160,000. The results were more favorable than those found in previous studies of alternate medication therapies for hypercholesterolemia. Even using conservative parameter assumptions, at least 800,000 Americans aged 35 to 55 years are at sufficiently high risk for CAD, so that the net cost of lovastatin therapy can be favorably compared with other widely used medical interventions.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether reperfusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or both, would improve left ventricular (LV) function when it is measured several months later at rest or maximal bicycle exercise, or both. Radionuclide angiography was performed in 44 patients 5 months (range 6 weeks to 9 months) after AMI to assess function, and tomographic myocardial thallium-201 imaging was performed at maximal exercise and delayed rest to determine whether there was any evidence of myocardial ischemia. As expected, no patient had chest pain or redistribution of a thallium defect during the exercise test, because patients had undergone angioplasty (n = 28) or coronary bypass graft surgery (n = 5) where clinically indicated for revascularization. The LV ejection fraction was plotted as a function of the time elapsed between the onset of chest pain and the time when coronary angiography confirmed patency of the infarct-related artery (achieved in 91% of 44 patients by rt-PA [n = 31] or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [n = 9] ). Functional responses differed markedly between patients with anterior (n = 20) versus inferior (n = 24) wall AMI. LV ejection fraction during exercise correlated with time to reperfusion in patients with an anterior wall AMI (r = -0.58; standard error of the estimate = 11.9%; p less than 0.02) but not in patients with an inferior AMI (r = 0.10; standard error of the estimate = 13.1%; difference not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Glibenclamide, a hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, is a blocker of the adenosine triphosphatase-modulated potassium ion channels. The opening of these channels in the myocardial cells, induced by acute myocardial hypoxia, can be responsible for ischemic ventricular arrhythmias. To evaluate the antiarrhythmic effects of this drug 19 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients were selected. They had coronary artery disease and evidence on Holter monitoring of ventricular premature complexes or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, induced by transient myocardial ischemia. In all patients, 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed to evaluate the number and duration of myocardial ischemic events, the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia per minute of ischemia and the percentage of ventricular premature complexes versus total ischemic beats. Selected patients were classified in 2 groups: group A (9 patients) received metformin (placebo) and group B (10 patients) was treated with glibenclamide. On the fourteenth day patients underwent 24-hour control monitoring. Then a crossover between the 2 groups was made and a new Holter monitoring sequence was performed at the end of the second phase. Results indicate that glibenclamide significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced both the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and the episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during transient myocardial ischemia, but did not change the number and duration of acute myocardial ischemic attacks and did not reduce the spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, glibenclamide appears to have an antiarrhythmic effect in preventing ventricular arrhythmias induced by transient myocardial ischemia.\r"

Multiple logistic regression analysis identified pulmonary arterial wedge pressure at rest and peak exercise stroke work index as the only independent predictors of mortality. A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that peak exercise stroke work index provided significant incremental prognostic information over the resting hemodynamic variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the diet cooked with palm olein significantly increased apolipoprotein A-I (11%) and apolipoprotein B (9%) concentrations. Unexpectedly, soybean-oil-cooked diets caused a significant increase (47%) in plasma triglycerides compared with palm-olein-cooked diets. We conclude that palm olein, when used as cooking oil, has no detrimental effects on plasma lipid profiles in Malaysian adolescents.\r"

Apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) for formation of the precursor carcinogen, 7,8-dihydrodiol BaP, were found to be 14.4 (BC), 1.74 (AC), and 0.7 (CTX) mumol/L. The order of anticarcinogenic strength established in this study was BC much greater than AC greater than CTX. Increased formation of the detoxification intermediate, 3-hydroxy BaP, with increased carotenoid concentration was observed. The order of detoxification strength was BC greater than AC = CTX. The presence of carotenoids in vivo inhibited BaP metabolism. Using 9,10-dihydrodiol BaP as an indicator for inhibition, the order of the antioxidative activity was palm oil (with carotenoids) greater than BC greater than CTX greater than palm oil (without carotenoids). BC and AC may selectively modify the rat-liver microsomal enzymes, thus providing a biochemical mechanism for the inhibitory effect of palm carotenoids on chemical carcinogenesis.\r"

Cell damage was extensive in the livers of AAF-treated rats but less extensive in the AAF-tocotrienols-treated rats when compared with normal and tocotrienols-treated rats. 2-Acetylaminofluorene significantly increases the activities of both plasma and liver microsomal gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) and liver microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDP-GT). Tocotrienols administered together with AAF significantly decrease the activities of plasma GGT after 12 and 20 wk (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.002, respectively) and liver microsomal UDP-GT after 20 wk (P less than 0.02) when compared with the controls and with rats treated only with tocotrienols. Liver microsomal GGT also showed a similar pattern to liver microsomal UDP-GT but the decrease was not significant. These results suggest that tocotrienols administered to AAF-treated rats reduce the severity of hepatocarcinogenesis.\r"

We report two patients receiving maintenance valproate, one with resolving acute hepatitis C and the other with chronic persistent hepatitis C, with incidental microvesicular steatosis demonstrated on oil-red O stains. We conclude that microvesicular steatosis does not necessarily signify hepatotoxicity in patients on chronic valproic acid, and should not lead to discontinuation of the drug until other causes of acute or chronic liver disease have been excluded.\r"

We assessed the impact of strengthening a parenteral antibiotic control policy and instituting continuous infectious disease service (IDS) reviews of the appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy on cost and patient outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients receiving intravenous antibiotics during a 3.5-year period from 1986 to 1989 were included in either the pre- or post-policy study group. Antibiotic costs 16 months before were compared with antibiotic costs 26 months after implementation of a new policy to restrict inappropriate usage of (1) broad-spectrum antibiotics when not necessary, (2) expensive agents when a less costly agent could be used, and (3) an excessive dosage or interval. Patient subgroups treated 4 months before and 4 months after policy implementation were compared further within diagnosis-related group (DRG) assignments using patient demographic, cost, and outcome measures. RESULTS: The average monthly antibiotic costs during the 26-month post-policy period were $7,600 less than during the 16-month pre-policy period (p less than 0.0001), resulting in an average yearly drug cost reduction of $91,200. The IDS team altered therapy in 611 (34.5%) of 1,769 reviews of antibiotic usage during the 26-month period. The comparisons among similar patient groups by DRG classification revealed the average number of antibiotic doses per study patient admission was decreased 24% (p = 0.005) and drug costs were reduced 32% (p = 0.004) after policy implementation. In two DRG categories (i.e., respiratory infections plus pneumonia), patients in the post-policy group had a 33% decrease in average number of doses (p = 0.05) and 45% decrease in antibiotic costs (p = 0.04) compared with the pre-policy group. Similar trends were observed in most DRG categories. There was an average $70 per admission decrease in drug cost and a reduction of eight antibiotic doses per admission after policy initiation. The overall prevalence of deaths (p = 0.22) and average length of antibiotic therapy (p = 0.29) were less in the post-policy period despite group similarities in patient characteristics and lengths of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic control policies can be developed to ensure quality care and can be designed to select for cost-effective agents. Prospective and continuous monitoring of antibiotic usage by the IDS resulted in a significant and sustained reduction in antibiotic costs without detrimental effect on the length of therapy or deaths.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and spectrum of underlying rheumatic diseases, especially Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and the antiphospholipid syndrome, and the prevalence of the lupus anticoagulant, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and rheumatoid factor (RF) within a neurologic patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study design entailed a prospective, consecutive sample of patients admitted to a university-affiliated neurology service for 72 hours or more. Study patients were obtained from a sequential evaluation of 100 inpatients with a wide spectrum of neurologic diseases. Another 31 eligible patients were not included due to refusal (n = 4), inability to give consent (n = 12), or an incomplete database (n = 15). All patients underwent a physical examination and responded to a rheumatic disease questionnaire (administered by one rheumatologist) assessing signs and symptoms relevant to rheumatic disease. All had lupus anticoagulant, ANA, and RF determinations. An independent patient evaluation was done by the attending neurologist. RESULTS: Eleven patients had a rheumatic or autoimmune disorder directly related to their neurologic admission: three patients with SS (one each with embolic stroke, dementia, and hemiparetic somatization); three patients with lupus anticoagulant syndrome (all with stroke, recurrent in two); one patient with systemic lupus erythematosus accompanied by migraine headache and the lupus anticoagulant; and one patient each with isolated central nervous system (CNS) angiitis, neuro-Behcet's disease, CNS Whipple's disease, and HLA-B27-associated spondyloarthropathy. Nineteen patients had one or more autoantibodies: ANA greater than or equal to 1:80 (n = 10); RF greater than or equal to 1:80 (n = 6); and positive lupus anticoagulant (n = 7). The seroreactivity of 10 of these patients remained unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: This neurologic population demonstrated significant seroreactivity and rheumatic disease associations, with SS and lupus anticoagulant-related neurologic disease the most common. Since SS and the antiphospholipid syndrome can be overlooked, it is recommended that a formal evaluation for SS and a direct lupus anticoagulant assay should be considered in the examination of patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of calcium and selected calcium antagonists on the lung phospholipid secretion associated with lung distension was examined in newborn rabbits. Lung distension was produced by saline lavage or air inflation in freshly killed pups. Calcium or calcium antagonists were added to the lavage solution. The fractional stimulation of secretion with 1.0 mM calcium was 1.94 +/- 0.28 (p less than 0.01), but ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) did not have the expected inhibitory effect. There was dose-related inhibition of phospholipid secretion induced by the calcium antagonist, lanthanum, the fractional recovery decreasing from 1.0 +/- 0.23 at 10(-5) molar, to 0.43 +/- 0.19 at 0.5 x 10(-4) molar, to 0.22 +/- 0.03 at 10(-4) molar and 0.19 +/- 0.05 at 10(-3) molar (p less than 0.001). This inhibition was significantly reversed by the addition of 10 mM calcium. Although nifedipine and verapamil had no effect, nickel and cadmium also inhibited secretion. Therefore, it is likely that lanthanum acted as a calcium channel blocker, suggesting the importance of extracellular calcium. The observation that intense calcium chelation with ethylene glycol bis-aminoethylether tetraacetic acid-bis-aminophenoxyethane tetraacetic acid (EGTA-BAPTA) had a significant inhibitory effect, supports the conclusion that a superficial calcium pool in the plasma membrane may be an important stimulus for phospholipid secretion during lung distension. The inhibitory effect of neomycin, a drug known to displace superficial calcium, was consistent with this conclusion.\r"

Clinical, electrophysiologic, and biochemical characteristics of this family do not fit any known category of human albinism. The degree of heterogeneity in expression of albinotic features was unexpected. The correlation between visual acuity and nystagmus was particularly strong. The brown-haired propositus had severe skin involvement, iris transillumination, fundus hypopigmentation, and foveal hypoplasia. He had no manifest nystagmus, however, and his visual acuity was nearly normal. These observations suggest that nystagmus imposes a visual deficit beyond that related to foveal hypoplasia alone.\r"

  ".U": "91189313\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study, the authors investigated the mechanism by which Al3+ preincubations inhibited the pathologic calcification of glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardium (GPBP) implanted subdermally in rats. The concentration dependency of the Al3+ anticalcification effect was compared with that of other trivalent metal ions (Fe3+, Ga3+, La3+) known to interact with calcium phosphates. In vitro incubations of GPBP were carried out in AlCl3 (10(-3) mol/l [molar] to 10(-1) mol/l) to ascertain both the optimal conditions for uptake of Al3+ and the time course of Al3+ dissociation. Al3+ uptake by GPBP was concentration dependent and occurred rapidly, with tissue levels after 1 hour not differing significantly from those after 72 hours of incubation. Analyses of GPBP samples preincubated in AlCl3 (0.1 mol/l, 24 hours) showed that more than 75% of the Al3+ remained tightly bound after 60 days' in vitro release at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4. Preincubations of GPBP in AlCl3 significantly inhibited calcification after subdermal implantation in rats for 60 days (Ca++ = 5.1 +/- 0.9 microgram/mg, 11.5 +/- 4.6 micrograms/mg, 70.3 +/- 23.0 micrograms/mg, mean +/- standard error [SE], for 10(-1) mol/l, 10(-2) mol/l, 10(-3) mol/l AlCl3, respectively), compared with controls (Ca++ = 110.0 +/- 9.3 micrograms/mg). All animals were free of Al3(+)-mediated adverse effects on bone, as determined by light microscopic evaluation of femoral epiphyseal growth plates. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of GPBP incubated in 10(-1) mol l AlCl3 for 24 hours demonstrated discrete Al3+ localization in the sarcolemma and cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes of devitalized pericardial connective tissue cells at intracellular sites coincident with phosphorus loci. Similar intracellular localization remained prominent in explants removed after 60 days; no calcific deposits were noted in these specimens. Preincubations in Fe3+ but not Ga3+ and La3+ solutions yielded significant inhibition of GPBP calcification, which did not differ significantly from that provided by Al3- and had a comparable concentration dependency. Light microscopic examination (Prussian blue staining) and EELS of FeCl3-preincubated explants demonstrated Fe3+ localization within devitalized GPBP connective tissue cells. The authors conclude that Al3+ and Fe3+ significantly inhibit the pathologic mineralization of glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardium by mechanisms that are likely related to the high affinity of these cations for membrane associated and other intracellular phosphorus loci.\r"

  ".W": "The precise identity of effector mononuclear cells capable of eliciting acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD) is controversial. In this study, highly purified subsets of donor T cells were used to produce AGVHD to multiple minor histocompatibility (H) antigens in two strain combinations of mice matched for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In the C3H.SW- greater than B6 strain combination, only CD8+ effector cells produced histologic evidence of AGVHD in skin and liver, which peaked 3 weeks after transplant. In the B10.D2- greater than DBA/2 strain combination, CD4+ effector cells, and to a lesser extent, CD8+ cells, mediated disease in skin, liver, and intestine, which peaked during the fourth week after transplant. Analysis of skin and liver from both combinations showed target cell injury that was phenotypically similar and resembled that previously described in human disease in other studies. In addition, prominent epithelial injury also was detected in oropharyngeal mucosa, esophagus, hepatobiliary ducts, and seminal vesicle in both transplant settings. These findings indicate that functionally different subsets of donor T cells may be capable of initiating common pathways of cellular injury in selected target sites in AGVHD, and have potential implications for strategies that seek to ablate disease development by manipulation of donor marrow before transplantation.\r"

Antibody prevalence to LCMV increased with age, but there were no racial or sexual differences. Neutralization tests and questionnaire responses implicated a domestic, rat-borne hantavirus as the source of SEOV antibody. Self-reported human-rodent contact indicated more exposure to house mice than rats within residences, although rats were more commonly sighted on streets. Infections with rodent-borne viruses were rare compared to the high rates of reported contact.\r"

The cost per year of life saved ranges between $6553 and $70 526, depending on which epidemiologic model of potential long-term zidovudine effect is used (in sensitivity analyses, the cost per year of life saved ranges between $2649 and $250 546).

Mechanisms underlying the development of these hemorrhages have not been clarified. We report a patient who developed two intracerebral hemorrhages shortly after receiving t-PA for the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction, and who was found to have cerebral amyloid angiopathy at autopsy. Staining of cortical sections with Congo red and an antibody directed against beta amyloid protein (A4 peptide) disclosed specific involvement of most of the subarachnoid and superficial cortical vessels in the region of the two hemorrhages. Based on the findings in this patient and in 6 additional patients reported recently, it is likely that cerebral amyloid angiopathy plays a pathogenic role in some intracerebral hemorrhages associated with the administration of t-PA. The cautious use of t-PA with heparin in patients who are elderly or demented may be advisable.\r"

In sheep during 3 to 7 days of continuous bypass, there was practically no hemolysis and relatively stable hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and the platelet counts remained within safe levels. The maximum extracorporeal blood flow tended to decrease from a mean of 1.55 L/min on day 1 to 1.34 L/min on day 3 to 1.28 L/min on day 7. Carbon dioxide extraction remained efficient throughout the perfusion, but there was a minimal decrease from the first day (10.92 mmol/L) to the third day (8.46 mmol/L) at the higher blood carbon dioxide concentrations; it remained stable thereafter at 9.0 mmol/L.\r"

In a group of 201 patients without concomitant disease, the mortality rate was 0.5% and the overall efficacy of the operation for free wall accessory pathways, 98%. A retrospective clinical study of 44 unselected patients was performed to examine how safe epicardial electrical ablation is. The criteria for intraoperative effectiveness were disappearance of both the delta wave and retrograde conduction and inability to induce tachycardia. In the postoperative and follow-up periods, the following were reviewed: electrocardiograms; Holter monitor recordings (24 to 26 hours); release of the myocardial-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase; intracardiac hemodynamics and myocardial contractility (radionuclide methods); selective coronary arteriograms and ventriculograms; mean work capacity (bicycle ergometer); diagnostic transesophageal electrical stimulation; and histology of the area of ablation. The main conclusion of this study is that epicardial electrical ablation is a highly efficient and safe operation for surgical elimination of parietal accessory pathways in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Its advantages are its technical simplicity and the opportunity to review results immediately during the operation.\r"

The most cost-effective regimen, however, is unknown. We reviewed our experience at two hospitals in the New York City area in which low-dose, intermittent therapy with the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was used to prevent PCP in HIV-infected patients. During a total of 202 months of primary prophylaxis in 32 patients and 319 months of secondary prophylaxis in 35 patients, PCP was diagnosed only once. More than 80% of patients were receiving zidovudine concomitantly. Adverse reactions to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole occurred in 31% and 52% of those receiving primary or secondary prophylaxis, respectively. When those patients who were considered ineligible to receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (principally based on a prior adverse drug reaction) are also factored in, then approximately 50% of HIV-infected patients are candidates for long-term trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. The projected cost savings of this prophylaxis regimen, compared with those currently recommended by the US Public Health Service, are enormous.\r"

However, in November 1989, the American Association of Blood Banks changed the requirement for storage of thawed cryoprecipitated AHF from room temperature to 1 degree C to 6 degrees C, while the Food and Drug Administration still required thawed cryoprecipitated AHF to be stored at room temperature. The present study was designed to measure and compare the factor VIII activity in 10 bags of thawed cryoprecipitated AHF that were split into aliquots and stored at room temperature and at 1 degree C to 6 degrees C. At 6 and 24 hours after thawing, the mean factor VIII activities (% of normal) of the room temperature-stored cryoprecipitated AHF were 741% and 680% vs 650% and 608% for the 1 degree C- to 6 degrees C-stored cryoprecipitated AHF (P less than .05 at 6 hours and P = .11 at 24 hours). The storage of thawed cryoprecipitated AHF at 1 degree C to 6 degrees C also resulted in precipitation of both factor VIII and fibrinogen. These data show that it is better to store thawed cryoprecipitated AHF at room temperature vs 1 degree C to 6 degrees C for factor VIII activity. These data also suggest that adequate levels of factor VIII are maintained in thawed cryoprecipitated AHF that has been stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours.\r"

All patients had axial hypertonia, vertical gaze palsy, and parkinsonian features. Dementia, pyramidal signs, and ataxia were seen in varying proportions. We analyzed the scans with a graphic method to calculate a steady-state 6-FD uptake rate constant for the whole striatum. Results were compared with those obtained in seven age-matched controls. As a group, the patients with progressive supranuclear palsy had reduced 6-FD uptake constants. The 6-FD uptake constant correlated inversely with the duration of the disease. Normal positron emission tographic findings in one patient with the shortest duration of symptoms suggests that in early progressive supranuclear palsy, parkinsonism may relate to dysfunction distal to the dopaminergic neurons.\r"

Marked loss of myelinated nerve fibers and thickening of the pial septum were also observed in the optic nerve. Both retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells had intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, but none were found in the optic nerve. These findings suggested that optic atrophy was induced by axonal wallerian degeneration secondary to retinal ganglion cell death.

Cataract screening and follow-up surgery were offered to more than 19,000 residents age 40 years and older in a probability sample of 90 villages in south India. Eight months after intervention, an evaluation was conducted to identify those in need of surgery who had been operated on. Two principal measures of program effectiveness are examined: awareness of cataract surgery and acceptance of the surgery. The type of intervention had a negligible effect on awareness of cataract surgery. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals who were aware of surgery tended to be male, literate, and more affluent than those who were unaware of that option. Interventions that covered the complete costs of surgery had higher surgery acceptance rates. One health education strategy, house-to-house visits by a subject with aphakia, increased acceptance of the procedure more than others. In a multiple logistic regression analysis of acceptance rates, persons accepting surgery tended to be male; other factors were not important in explaining variation in acceptance rates.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted followup of 264 patients with definite systemic sclerosis (SSc) who were entered into the multicenter Scleroderma Criteria Cooperative Study (SCCS) during 1973-1977. At the end of the study (average 5.2 years of followup), 38% were known to be alive, 50% were dead (68% of these deaths definitely related to SSc), and 12% were lost to followup. Survival analyses of 484 demographic, clinical, and laboratory items recorded at entry into the SCCS (within 2 years of physician diagnosis of SSc) were performed. Survival declined linearly, and the cumulative survival rate was less than 80% at 2 years, 50% at 8.5 years, and 30% at 12 years after entry. Analysis using combinations of entry variables identifying organ system involvement confirmed that renal, cardiac, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal involvement in SSc predicted reduced survival; however, data on organ system involvement at study entry could not be used to consistently predict which organ system would ultimately be involved as the primary cause of death. By survival tree analysis, the individual entry variables best predicting reduced survival included older age (greater than 64 years), reduced renal function (blood urea nitrogen greater than 16 mg/dl), anemia (hemoglobin less than or equal to 11 gm/dl), reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (less than or equal to 50% of predicted), reduced total serum protein level (less than or equal to 6 gm/dl), and reduced pulmonary reserve (forced vital capacity less than 80% with hemoglobin greater than 14 gm/dl or forced vital capacity less than 65% with hemoglobin less than or equal to 14 gm/dl). Cox proportional hazards model analysis confirmed these results. Different combinations of variables led to markedly different survival rates. The poorest prospects for survival were in patients with SSc who were less than or equal to 64 years old with a hemoglobin level less than or equal to 11 gm/dl, and in those greater than 64 years old with a blood urea nitrogen level greater than 16 mg/dl. These results may be useful in predicting individual patients at risk for shortened survival.\r"

In the present studies, natural killer (NK) cells were examined as a model for FC gamma receptor type III-positive (FC gamma RIII+) cells, with regard to their interaction with RF. NK cell antigen CD16 (FC gamma RIII) and CD56 expression and functional NK and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity were compared in peripheral blood lymphocytes and autologous synovial fluid lymphocytes (SFL) of RA patients. Peripheral blood lymphocytes and SFL showed normal CD56 expression. In contrast, both the frequency and the density of CD16 antigen were decreased in SFL. Furthermore, diminished NK cytotoxicity and a significant decrease in ADCC were observed in SF NK cells. In subsequent in vitro studies with normal fresh NK cells, it was demonstrated that IgG-containing RF complexes from RA patients induced a modulation of FC gamma RIII structure from the NK cell surface, a decrease in NK activity, and a complete loss of ADCC. When purified RF was incubated with NK-enriched cell lines from RA patients, increased transcription and subsequent production of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha were observed. These data suggest a direct involvement of RF complexes in the pathogenetic process of chronic inflammation in RA.\r"

These patients' sera contained elevated levels of antineurofilament antibodies. Patients with focal CNS lupus had areas of increased signal intensity and atrophic changes in regions corresponding to the major cerebral vessels. These MRI abnormalities did not improve after treatment with high-dose steroids. The sera of patients with focal CNS lupus had elevated levels of cardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant but normal levels of antineurofilament antibody. Our findings suggest that results of a combined clinical, MRI, and serologic evaluation of patients with CNS lupus may predict the response of patients to high-dose steroid therapy.\r"

Highly purified T cells also showed augmented CD3 responses, but only in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate or a combination of phorbol myristate acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187, and not with calcium ionophore alone. The data suggest integrity of the T cell receptor/CD3 pathway for T cell activation in patients with SLE, as examined in cultures stimulated with specific anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies rather than with multivalent lectins. An increased response via the CD3 complex could contribute to the autoimmune activity in human SLE.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess general practitioners' involvement with long term mentally ill patients and attitudes towards their care. DESIGN--Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING--General practices in South West Thames region. SUBJECTS--507 general practitioners, 369 (73%) of whom returned the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The number of adult long term mentally ill patients whom general practitioners estimate they have on their lists and general practitioners' willingness to take responsibility for them. RESULTS--110 respondents had noticed an effect of the discharge of adult long term mentally ill patients on their practices. Most (225) respondents estimated that they had 10 or fewer such patients each on their lists. Having higher numbers was significantly associated with practising in Greater London or within three miles of a large mental hospital and having contact with a psychiatrist visiting the practice. 333 general practitioners would agree to share the care of long term mentally ill patients with the psychiatrist by taking responsibility for the patients' physical problems. Only 59 would agree to act as a key worker, 308 preferring the community psychiatric nurse to do it. Only nine had specific practice policies for looking after long term mentally ill patients and 287 agreed that such patients often come to their general practitioner's attention only when there is a crisis. CONCLUSIONS--The uneven distribution of long term mentally ill patients suggests that community pyschiatric resources might be better targeted at those practices with higher numbers of such patients. Most general practitioners seem to be receptive to a shared care plan when the consultant takes responsibility for monitoring psychiatric health with the community nurse as key worker. The lack of practice policies for reviewing the care of long term mentally ill patients must limit general practitioners' ability to prevent crises developing in their care.\r"

Thirty-one patients were randomized to the RT regimen and 28 to the RT + CT regimen. The complete local response rate was 58% for the RT group and 75% for the RT + CT group (P = 0.77). The median duration of response was 8 months for both groups. The overall 5-year survival rates were 6% and 16% (P = 0.16) for the RT and RT + CT groups, respectively. Acute toxicities were more pronounced in the RT + CT group. This clinical trial did not detect a difference in outcome with combined-technique therapy. This result must be interpreted with caution because of the small number of patients entered in this trial. Confirmation of the value or lack of value for combined therapy will require additional larger clinical trials.\r"

The expression of major histocompatibility complex Class I antigen on the membrane also was enhanced by irradiation. In addition, the irradiated cell groups, when analyzed using a CEA-specific probe, showed remarkable increases in the CEA mRNA. These enhancements increased in the 10-Gy and 15-Gy irradiated populations compared with the 5-Gy irradiated population. These results suggest that the enhancement of expression of CEA by radiation takes place at the CEA gene expression (mRNA) level but not at the protein level.\r"

Patients with tumor location on the extremities received subcutaneous (SC) injection of 2 million IU of IFN-beta distal the locoregional lymph nodes instead. All patients were given 50 micrograms IFN-gamma SC on 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Antibody formation was detected by coincubation of IFN and patients' serum and assessment of the inhibition of the cytopathic effect by a virus suspension. Soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. No antibodies against IFN-gamma were observed. The overall incidence of antibody formation to IFN-beta was 55.8% (19/34). Ninety-two percent of the SC-treated patients (13/14) and 30% (six of 20) of the IV-treated patients developed antibodies. Soluble interleukin-2 receptors were found to be significantly lower in antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients. The authors conclude that IFN-beta antibody formation is frequent and might influence IFN induced sIL-2R elevation in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Previous studies have shown that little if any increase in heart rate occurs 1 minute before the onset of ischemia in ambulant patients with coronary artery disease. This study tested the hypothesis that there are characteristic relations between heart rate and ischemia in ambulant patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. Twenty-one patients with proven coronary disease demonstrated 212 episodes of ischemia during 504 hours of continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram. An important increase in heart rate (from 74 +/- 11 to 90 +/- 14 beats/min, p less than 0.001) occurred between 5 and 30 minutes (not 1 minute) before the onset of ischemia. A significantly higher heart rate at onset of ischemia was seen during Bruce protocol exercise testing than during daily life (117 +/- 12 versus 95 +/- 15 beats/min, p less than 0.01). However, when a less-strenuous, but more prolonged, exercise protocol was used in a subgroup of patients (n = 12), ischemia occurred at a heart rate that was significantly lower than during the Bruce protocol (88 +/- 14 versus 103 +/- 15 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and was not significantly different from the threshold heart rate at onset of ischemia during daily life (88 +/- 14 versus 84 +/- 12 beats/min, p = NS). As part of two placebo-controlled trials, treatment with both propranolol and nitroglycerin altered the distribution of ischemic events by heart rate but in opposite directions. Although propranolol largely eliminated events occurring at high (greater than 100 beats/min) and moderate (80-100 beats/min) heart rates, the number of events at low (less than 80 beats/min) heart rates was increased. In contrast, nitroglycerin reduced episodes at low and moderate heart rates only. CONCLUSIONS. Important increases in heart rate occur before the onset of ischemia during daily life, but this increase occurs much earlier than has been reported. Duration of heart rate increase appears to influence the heart rate threshold for ischemia, and this may contribute to the occurrence of ischemia at lower heart rates during daily life than during standard exercise testing. Last, different classes of drugs appear to have characteristic effects on ischemia occurring at different heart rates that may be useful in planning therapy.\r"

In an attempt to prevent nitrate tolerance, this study evaluated the interaction of nitroglycerin with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with and without a sulfhydryl group. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty-four subjects were randomized to a 7-day regimen of enalapril 10 mg b.i.d., captopril 25 mg t.i.d., or placebo. Venodilator response to nitroglycerin was assessed with forearm plethysmography by measuring the change in venous volume after administration of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin. Plethysmographic measurements were obtained serially 1) at baseline, 2) after 4 days of ACE inhibitor or placebo, 3) 2 hours after application of a 10 mg/24 hr nitroglycerin patch, and 4) 74 hours after continuous nitropatch application. ACE inhibition alone caused no significant change in the response to sublingual nitroglycerin. Nitrate response remained unchanged after 2 hours (\"acute\") of nitropatch exposure in all three groups. After 74 hours (\"chronic\") of continuous nitropatch application, the venodilator response to sublingual nitroglycerin was reduced by 40% in the placebo group, 10% in the enalapril group, and 2% in the captopril group. This attenuation was significant only in the placebo group (p less than 0.01). Pairwise comparison of nitrate response between groups was significantly different between the captopril and placebo groups (p less than 0.01) and between the placebo and enalapril groups (p less than 0.05). Plasma renin levels increased equally in the enalapril and captopril groups. Body weight increased only in the placebo group, suggesting prevention of nitrate-induced volume expansion in the ACE inhibitor groups. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates that ACE inhibitors may prevent nitrate tolerance to long-term nitrate therapy.\r"

After thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, increasing emphasis is placed on early submaximal exercise testing, with further intervention advocated only for demonstrable ischemia. Although significant residual coronary artery lesions after successful thrombolysis are common, many patients paradoxically have no corresponding provokable ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. The relation between significant postthrombolytic residual coronary artery disease and a negative early, submaximal exercise thallium-201 tomogram was studied among 101 consecutive patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction and at least 70% residual stenosis of the infarct artery. A negative test occurred in 49 (48.5%) patients with a mean 88% residual infarct artery stenosis. Further characteristics of the group were as follows: mean time to treatment was 3.1 hours; mean age was 54 +/- 10 years; 80% were male; 47% had anterior infarction; 39% had multivessel disease; mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 53 +/- 14%; and mean peak creatine kinase level was 3,820 +/- 3,123 IU/ml. A similar group of 52 (51.5%) patients, treated within 3.3 hours from symptom onset, with a mean postthrombolysis stenosis of 90%, had a positive exercise test. Characteristics of this group were as follows: age was 58 +/- 10 years; 92% were male; 56% had anterior infarction; 40% had multivessel disease; and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 54 +/- 15%. The peak creatine kinase level associated with the infarction, however, was lower: 2,605 +/- 1,805 IU/ml (p = 0.04). There was no difference in performance at exercise testing with respect to peak systolic pressure, peak heart rate, or time tolerated on the treadmill between the two groups. By multivariate logistic regression, only peak creatine kinase level predicted a negative stress result in the presence of a significant residual stenosis (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-16.3). CONCLUSIONS. The explanation for the relatively frequent finding of a negative early stress 201Tl tomogram after apparently successful reperfusion appears to be more extensive myocardial necrosis and not delay in therapy or inadequate exercise performance.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Receptors that couple via the stimulatory G protein, Gs, to adenylate cyclase and to a positive inotropic response have been extensively investigated in falling human heart. In contrast, much less is known about receptors, such as the A1-adenosine receptor, that couple to adenylate cyclase via the inhibitory G protein, Gi, to give a negative inotropic response. Activation of such Gi-coupled receptors might worsen heart failure. Furthermore, alpha Gi is increased in failing human ventricular myocardium, which may enhance inhibitory receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase. METHODS AND RESULTS. A1-Adenosine receptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase was examined in crude particulate preparations derived from 12 nonfailing and 12 failing human left ventricles. Experimental conditions were designed for maximal inhibitory responses. Dose-response curves were performed with the selective A1-adenosine receptor agonist R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine (R-PIA). No differences in nonfailing versus failing heart were observed for basal adenylate cyclase activity (49.0 +/- 4.1 versus 45.7 +/- 2.6 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg), maximal R-PIA-mediated inhibition (31.1 +/- 2.6 versus 30.2 +/- 1.6 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg), ED50 (R-PIA x 10(-7) 1.28 +/- 0.10 versus 1.36 +/- 0.08), or slope (1.06 +/- 0.06 versus 1.03 +/- 0.10), respectively. Furthermore, fluoride, forskolin, and manganese adenylate cyclase activation were not different in failing heart, which is consistent with no change in the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase. The inhibitory G protein alpha Gi, as quantitated by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, was increased in failing heart (105.7 +/- 5.8 versus 132.7 +/- 3.4 optical density units, p less than 0.003). Basal adenylate cyclase activity was reduced in failing heart (7.8 +/- 0.8 versus 4.5 +/- 0.4 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg, p less than 0.005) with assay conditions designed to assess G protein effects. CONCLUSIONS. The A1-adenosine receptor pathway exerts a major inhibitory effect on human myocardial adenylate cyclase activity. Although alpha Gi was increased in failing heart, A1-adenosine receptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase was not altered in preparations of failing versus nonfailing human ventricular myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Despite the utility of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in eliciting coronary thrombolysis clinically, early reocclusion remains a problem, occurring despite anticoagulation in 5-30% of patients with initially successful recanalization. This study evaluated the utility of Hybrid-B, a molecular variant of t-PA with a prolonged half-life in the circulation, in eliciting coronary thrombolysis and maintaining patency in the presence of a continuing thrombogenic stimulus. METHODS AND RESULTS. In intact, anesthetized dogs, either 18 mg Hybrid-B over 30 minutes (n = 15) or 50 mg t-PA (Activase) over 60 minutes (n = 8) was administered starting 60 minutes after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was induced with a thrombogenic copper coil. Time to lysis averaged 54 +/- 26 (means +/- SD) minutes and 64 +/- 34 minutes with Hybrid-B and t-PA, respectively (p = NS). When Hybrid-B was administered as a bolus (20 mg over 1 minute) to induce a high initial concentration in blood, time to lysis was shortened markedly and averaged 15 +/- 5 minutes. Dogs given Hybrid-B by either infusion or bolus exhibited prolonged time to reocclusion (337 +/- 192 minutes compared with 192 +/- 125 minutes in dogs given t-PA, p less than 0.03), reflecting maintenance of a subthrombolytic but persistently active concentration of activator in blood. Despite the persistence of Hybrid-B in blood, concentrations of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin were not depleted markedly and remained at 77 +/- 25 and 56 +/- 24%, respectively, of control values. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, Hybrid-B, a novel variant of t-PA with unique pharmacokinetic properties, elicits prompt, sustained, and clot-selective coronary thrombolysis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that adaptive cytoprotection is related to increased blood flow caused by mild irritants. The stomach of cats was perfused with saline at pH 1.0. Mucosal blood flow was determined by radioactive microspheres, and celiac artery blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound. Gastric blood flow was left undisturbed or reduced by tightening a vessel loop around the celiac artery. Mucosal exposure to absolute ethanol for 2 minutes caused extensive damage to the surface epithelium, the pits, and the upper half of the glands. Pretreatment of the mucosa with 2 mol/L NaCl for 10 minutes prevented the development of mucosal lesions after subsequent application of absolute ethanol. The mucosal blood flow increased markedly after treatment with 2 mol/L NaCl. When this hyperemic response was inhibited by reducing celiac artery blood flow, ethanol caused lesions of similar degree as in animals not pretreated with 2 mol/L NaCl. A highly significant correlation was obtained between mucosal blood flow, as determined just before the application of ethanol, and the degree of ethanol-induced damage. At a chosen level of blood flow, ethanol caused the same degree of damage with or without pretreatment with 2 mol/L NaCl. In conclusion, high mucosal blood flow caused by a mild irritant is an important factor in adaptive gastric protection. With the present experimental setup, the protection could be fully explained as a result of the hyperemic response caused by 2 mol/L NaCl.\r"

Pure ethanol applied to the luminal side or to the submucosal side at low concentrations (2%-10%) was a potent stimulant of acid secretion, whereas high concentrations (greater than or equal to 20%) were inhibitory. Cimetidine and calcium-free solutions did not abolish the secretory effect of ethanol. Beer and wine, but not rum and whisky, caused a significant stimulation of acid secretion. Respiration was progressively increased by ethanol at concentrations between 2% and 20%. This effect was not affected by cimetidine or by SCH 28080, an inhibitor of the gastric hydrogen-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. Ethanol (10%) significantly increased by 46% the tissue lactate-pyruvate ratio. The oxidations of glucose, butyrate, and acetate were progressively reduced by low concentrations of ethanol (5% and 10%). The results indicate that (a) low concentrations of ethanol and alcoholic beverages with low ethanol content are direct stimulants of acid secretion and (b) the secretory and metabolic effects of low concentrations of ethanol seem to be mediated via its oxidation.\r"

All patients underwent an intercostal liver biopsy, and the specimen was independently read by two pathologists. The PGA index varied from 0 to 12. When PGA was less than or equal to 2, the probability of cirrhosis was 0% and the probability of normal liver or minimal changes 83%. Conversely, when PGA was greater than or equal to 9, the probability of normal liver or minimal changes was 0% and the probability of cirrhosis 86%. These values did not vary between training and validation periods, between asymptomatic vs. symptomatic subjects or between PGA at admission vs. PGA 1 week later. This index could be useful for general practitioners in identifying subjects at high risk for severe alcoholic liver disease.\r"

  ".W": "Introduction of a radioactive gastrointestinal marker (51CrCl3) into a combined study (75SeHCAT + 58CoB12) of ileal function by whole body counting has been undertaken. The technique was assessed in 23 subjects (15 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, six on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, and two normal subjects). Mean (SD) 51CrCl3 retention was only 4.1 (6.0)% on day 4, and was similar on day 7 in subjects given a second dose of 51CrCl3 on day 4. Only one subject had more than 20% of 51CrCl3 retention after four days. A 51CrCl3 correction method adequately corrected for colonic hold up of 58CoB12, when compared with final equilibrium values of 58CoB12 retention. Use of the non-absorbed 58CoB12 fraction as a gastrointestinal marker gave good agreement with the 51CrCl3 method in correcting 75SeHCAT values. In all subjects studied, corrections for colonic retention of 75SeHCAT on day 4, were small (less than 7% of dose) and did not affect the assessment of any subject. In conclusion, an additional gastrointestinal marker such as 51CrCl3 is unnecessary in our combined study since that role can be effected, when indicated by the non-absorbed 58CoB12 fraction.\r"

Stomach to caecum transit time was measured by environmental hydrogen analysis. Ileal infusion of a range of free fatty acids including petroselinic, oleic, myristoleic, erucic, linoleic, and linolenic all significantly slowed stomach to caecum transit time, as did the detergents (sodium bis (2-ethyl hexyl) sulphosuccinate and sodium linoleyl sulphate), the triglyceride corn oil, and the phospholipid lecithin. Although the lipid soluble deconjugated bile acid deoxycholic acid slowed stomach to caecum transit time, the water soluble conjugated bile acid taurocholic acid accelerated it. Infusion of the lipid alcohol oleyl alcohol and the calcium chelating agent disodium edetate (EDTA) into the ileum did not delay the passage of the meal through the stomach and small intestine. The diversity of lipid substances activating the ileal brake suggest a nonspecific effect by lipid soluble substances that can penetrate cell membranes. The lack of effect of EDTA suggested that calcium binding was not important.\r"

Oral corticosteroids have been used for patients who seem to be resistant to gluten withdrawal but preparations with low systemic bioavailability might be preferable. We have given a new glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate) to 12 adults with untreated coeliac disease for six weeks while they were on a normal diet. One patient defaulted and one suffered a relapse in a pre-existing neoplasm. Excluding these, there was an improvement of symptoms, a mean weight gain of 2 kg, and a rise in albumin of 5.4 g/l. There was a significant improvement in the lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (p less than 0.05) and in all histological variables examined in paired biopsy specimens (surface and crypt intraepithelial lymphocyte/enterocyte and goblet cell/enterocyte ratios and enterocyte height, p less than 0.01 or better). In six paired specimens sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activity increased in all (p less than 0.05) and lactase in five of six. No appreciable side effects were observed, but two patients had suppressed cortisol values and synacthen responses at six weeks. A further three, with normal pretrial results, had a blunted tetracosactrin response at six weeks. Fluticasone propionate seems worthy of further assessment in the treatment of coeliac disease as an adjunct to gluten withdrawal.\r"

  ".W": "Increased small intestinal permeability caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is probably a prerequisite for NSAID enteropathy, a source of morbidity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This increased small intestinal permeability may be a summation of a local effect during drug absorption, a systemic effect after absorption, and a local effect of the drug excreted in bile, but the relative contribution made by these factors is unknown. We assessed the effect of indomethacin and nabumetone on intestinal permeability. The principal active metabolite of nabumetone, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid, is not subject to appreciable enterohepatic recirculation. Twelve volunteers were studied before and after one week's ingestion of indomethacin (150 mg/day) and nabumetone (1 g/day) with a combined absorption/permeability test. Neither drug had a significant effect on the permeation of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose, D-xylose, and L-rhamnose. Indomethacin increased the permeation of radioactive 51chromium ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (51Cr EDTA) significantly from baseline (mean (SEM) 0.63 (0.09)% v 1.20 (0.14)%, p less than 0.01) but nabumetone did not (0.70 (0.10)% p greater than 0.1). These results were supported by the 51Cr EDTA/L-rhamnose urine excretion ratios, which reflect changes in intestinal permeability. They suggest that NSAIDs increase intestinal permeability during absorption or after biliary excretion and that the systemic effect is of minor importance.\r"

  ".W": "Increased arachidonic acid concentrations in experimental rodent colonic cancer have been described recently. In humans, a reduced erythrocyte stearic acid to oleic acid ratio has been reported in patients with colorectal cancer and it has been proposed that similar changes exist in the cancer tissue. The long chain fatty acids in the cancers of 15 patients with colorectal cancer were measured and compared with values in the unaffected mucosa. The values were expressed as mean (SD) mg fatty acid/g tissue and compared by analysis of variance. In the cancer tissue arachidonic acid was increased (0.703 (0.109) mg/g v 0.603 (0.127) mg/g, p less than 0.05) as was docosahexaenoic acid (0.211 (0.066) mg/g v 0.148 (0.039) mg/g, p less than 0.001). In contrast, the stearic acid to oleic acid ratio in the cancer tissue was increased rather than decreased, as previously suggested (0.36 (0.05) v 0.29 (0.7), p less than 0.01). Increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations may be related to reduced lipid peroxidation, which is a feature of rapidly growing cells. Alternatively, the increased arachidonic acid values could be due to enhanced desaturase activity upon linoleic and linolenic acid, leading perhaps to increased formation of prostaglandins and other lipoxygenase products.\r"

Three of nine patients immunized with phi X174 had normal primary and secondary Ab responses, five had accelerated declines in their titers after initially normal primary Ab responses and lower than normal secondary Ab responses, and two of the latter patients failed to switch normally from IgM to IgG Ab production. Only one of 10 patients tested had normal Ab responses to diphtheria toxoid, and postimmunization antitetanus titers were abnormally low in five of the 10 patients tested. Serum Abs to H. influenzae polyribose phosphate were protective in seven of the eight immunized patients. Five of the nine patients administered Pneumovax had poor Ab responses to at least one of the pneumococcal serotypes 7, 9, or 14. Abnormal antipolysaccharide responses did not correlate with IgG2 deficiency. All patients responded with protective Ab levels to type 3.

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of the nasal administration (twice in each nostril, four times a day) of levocabastine (0.5 mg/ml) were compared with those of sodium cromoglycate (20 mg/ml) and placebo in a 2-week, parallel, double-blind trial in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. At the end of treatment, 89% of patients in the levocabastine-treated group rated their treatment as globally good or excellent as compared with 32% (p = 0.003) of sodium cromoglycate-treated and 35% (p = 0.002) of placebo-treated patients. According to the investigators' ratings, the severest nasal symptom and ocular complaints responded better to levocabastine than to cromoglycate (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03) or placebo treatment (p = 0.03 and p = 0.001). Visual analogue scale ratings in patients' diaries indicated that at the end of therapy, nasal symptoms were less severe in the levocabastine-treated group than in the sodium cromoglycate-treated (p = 0.03) or placebo-treated group (p = 0.001). Total symptom severity as a percentage of the theoretical maximum symptom severity during the treatment period was lower for levocabastine than for sodium cromoglycate (p = 0.06) or placebo (p = 0.004) for the severest nasal symptom (35% versus 47% and 76%), sneezing (the most frequent symptom) (27% versus 42% and 67%), and itchy nose (18% versus 37% and 67%). The percentage of days at which nasal symptoms were entirely absent was markedly higher in the levocabastine-treated (33%) than in the sodium cromoglycate-treated (9%; p = 0.006) or placebo-treated (3%; p = 0.001) group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between March, 1983, and February, 1989, 19 infants or children with chiasmal/hypothalamic gliomas were treated with chemotherapy after either surgical or radiological diagnosis. The patients ranged in age from 15 weeks to 15.6 years (median 3.2 years) at the start of therapy. Twelve patients were treated immediately after diagnosis because of progressive symptoms, and seven received chemotherapy after either radiographic progression or clinical deterioration, including progressive visual loss or intracranial hypertension. Based on biopsy results, seven of these tumors were classified as juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, two as astrocytomas, two as highly anaplastic astrocytomas, and one as a subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. There was associated neurofibromatosis in four patients. The two initial patients were treated with either actinomycin D and vincristine or 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and 6-thioguanine. The remaining patients received nitrosourea-based therapy; 15 evaluable patients were treated with a five-drug regimen that included 6-thioguanine, procarbazine, dibromodulcitol, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU), and vincristine and one received 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and 5-fluorouracil. Fifteen of the 18 evaluable patients initially managed with chemotherapy either responded to therapy or their condition stabilized. Median time to tumor progression has not been reached at a median follow-up period of 79 weeks (range 6.6 to 303 weeks), and no tumor-related death has occurred with a median follow-up period of 79 weeks (range 18 to 322 weeks) from the initiation of therapy. The four patients who failed therapy or whose disease progressed after chemotherapy were treated satisfactorily with radiation therapy. Initial improvement or stabilization of visual function was obtained in 16 patients. Endocrine function remained stable in all patients during treatment, although three patients required pharmacological treatment for endocrinopathy that was present at diagnosis. These preliminary results suggest that nitrosourea-based cytotoxic regimens are useful for the initial treatment of children with chiasmal/hypothalamic gliomas, and allow potentially harmful radiation therapy to be deferred until progression of disease.\r"

  ".W": "Most patients with moderate to severe head injury initially do not tolerate enteral feedings postinjury. This intolerance is more prolonged than that found in patients suffering other types of trauma. The authors prospectively evaluated 12 patients with moderate to severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score between 4 and 10) throughout their hospitalization for liquid gastric emptying as a possible mechanism for intolerance to enteral feeding. During Week 1, the majority of patients displayed a delay in gastric emptying. Patients also displayed an abnormal biphasic response (gastric emptying faster than normal during the early stage but prolonged later). By Week 2, many patients still had delayed and abnormal biphasic responses to gastric emptying. By Week 3, an improvement was observed with the majority of patients exhibiting rapid gastric emptying, but delays and abnormal biphasic responses were still seen. Patients who initially had rapid or normal gastric emptying tolerated full-strength full-rate feedings significantly earlier compared with those who experienced delayed gastric emptying (8.5 +/- 0.5 days vs. 13.7 +/- 3.2 days, p less than 0.001). All patients tolerated full-strength full-rate feedings by Day 16 postinjury (range 7 to 16 days) except the two patients who displayed delayed gastric emptying for prolonged periods of time (mean 25 days). This is the first study to longitudinally evaluate gastric emptying following head injury. The authors suggest that patients with moderate to severe head injury often experience alterations in gastric emptying which may affect their ability to tolerate enteral feedings.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of intrathecal fibrinolysis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption was investigated after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In 11 cats, SAH was induced by intracisternal application of 1 to 4 ml of fresh autologous blood. Thirty minutes after the experimental SAH, the CSF outflow resistance was found to be elevated from a median of 77 mm Hg/ml/min (range 41.3 to 109 mm Hg/ml/min) to a median of 580 mm Hg/ml/min (range 104 to 7000 mm Hg/ml/min). A logarithmic relationship could be demonstrated between the volume of subarachnoid blood and the elevation of the CSF outflow resistance. The intrathecal application of 2 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), which is a fibrinolytic substance suitable for lysis of subarachnoid blood clots in man, resulted in an almost total restoration of CSF absorption after experimental SAH. The CSF outflow resistance after SAH was lowered by application of rt-PA from a median of 1028.05 mm Hg/ml/min (range 394 to 7000 mm Hg/ml/min) to 79 mm Hg/ml/min (range 56.7 to 223 mm Hg/ml/min). It is concluded that the impairment of CSF absorption after SAH may play an important role in the pathogenesis of post-hemorrhagic vasospasm.\r"

These cell lines were shown to express the interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene constitutively, and exposure of these cells to 5 ng/ml of recombinant human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) increased IL-6 gene expression. Other recombinant human lymphokines, namely interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor had no enhancing effect on IL-6 gene expression. Dexamethasone added to the cultures at 10(-7) M concentration suppressed the constitutive expression of the IL-6 gene. At a concentration of 10(-5) M, dexamethasone partially suppressed the IL-1 enhanced expression of IL-6. The IL-6 gene probe also hybridized to RNA from unfractionated synovial fluid cells, peripheral blood T cells and non-T cells but not Epstein-Barr virus transformed peripheral blood B cells of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our results suggest that in rheumatoid arthritis, synovial fibroblasts actively participate in joint inflammation by lymphokine production. The coexpression of both IL-1 and IL-6 by one synovial fibroblast line suggests a mechanism for the perpetuation of synovitis.\r"

Oregon's draft priority list was criticized because it seemed to favor minor treatments over lifesaving ones. This reaction reflects a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between cost-effectiveness analysis and the powerful human proclivity to rescue endangered life: the \"Rule of Rescue.\" Oregon's final priority list was generated without reference to costs and is, therefore, more intuitively sensible than the initial list. However, the utility of the final list is limited by its lack of specificity with regard to conditions and treatments. An alternative approach for setting health care priorities would circumvent the Rule of Rescue by carefully defining necessary indications for treatment. Such an approach might be applied to Oregon's final list in order to achieve better specificity.\r"

Three complete small-bowel transplants, two with the liver from the same donor also transplanted, were done successfully. Patients were immunosuppressed with FK 506. 5 to 11% of lymphocytes in the recipients' peripheral blood were of donor origin during the early postoperative period when there were no clinical signs of graft-versus-host disease. However, donor cells were no longer detectable after 12 to 54 days. Serial biopsy specimens of the grafted small bowel showed progressive replacement of lymphocytes in the lamina propria by those of the recipient's HLA phenotype. Lymphoid repopulation was complete after 10 to 12 weeks but the epithelial cells of the intestine remained those of the donor. The patients are on enteral alimentation after 5, 6, and 8 months with histopathologically normal or nearly normal intestines. Re-examination of assumptions about the rejection of intestinal grafts and strategies for its prevention are required following these observations.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In 1983 the proportion of health care expenditures consumed by administration in the United States was 60 percent higher than in Canada and 97 percent higher than in Britain. To assess the effects of recent health policy initiatives on the administrative efficiency of health care, we examined four components of administrative costs in the United States and Canada for 1987: insurance overhead, hospital administration, nursing home administration, and physicians' billing and overhead expenses. Most data were provided by the two nations' federal health and statistics agencies, supplemented by state and provincial data and published sources. Because data on physicians' billing costs were limited, we estimated a range for these costs by two methods that rely on different sources of data. All figures are reported in 1987 U.S. dollars. RESULTS. In 1987 health care administration cost between $96.8 billion and $120.4 billion in the United States, amounting to 19.3 to 24.1 percent of total spending on health care, or $400 to $497 per capita. In Canada, between 8.4 and 11.1 percent of health care spending ($117 to $156 per capita) was devoted to administration. Administrative costs in the United States increased 37 percent in real dollars between 1983 and 1987, whereas in Canada they declined. The proportion of health care spending consumed by administration is now at least 117 percent higher in the United States than in Canada and accounts for about half the total difference in health care spending between the two nations. If health care administration in the United States had been as efficient as in Canada, $69.0 billion to $83.2 billion would have been saved in 1987. CONCLUSIONS. The administrative structure of the U.S. health care system is increasingly inefficient as compared with that of Canada's national health program. Recent health policies with the avowed goal of improving the efficiency of care have imposed substantial new bureaucratic costs and burdens.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium release from intracellular stores is a point of convergence for a variety of receptors involved in cell signaling. Consequently, the mechanism(s) by which cells differentiate between individual receptor signals is central to transmembrane communication. There are significant differences in timing and magnitude of Ca2+ release stimulated by the m2 and m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The m2 receptors couple to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein to activate phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis weakly and to stimulate small, delayed and oscillatory chloride currents. In contrast, m3 receptors potently activate phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and stimulate large, rapid and transient chloride currents by a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein pathway. Using confocal microscopy, we now show that the m2- and m3-coupled Ca2+ release pathways can also be spatially distinguished. At submaximal acetylcholine concentrations, both receptors stimulated pulses of Ca2+ release from discrete foci in random, periodic and frequently bursting patterns of activity. But maximal stimulation of m2 receptors increased the number of focal release sites, whereas m3 receptors invariably evoked a Ca2+ wave propagating rapidly just beneath the plasma membrane surface. Analysis of pertussis toxin sensitivity and hybrid m2-m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors confirmed that these Ca2+ release patterns represent distinct cell signalling pathways.\r"

  ".U": "91194767\r", 
  ".W": "Many hormones, neurotransmitters and growth factors, on binding to G protein-coupled receptors or receptors possessing tyrosine kinase activity, increase intracellular levels of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol. This is due to activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase(s) C (PLC), the isozymes of which are classified into groups, alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The beta, gamma and delta groups themselves contain PLC isozymes which have both common and unique structural domains. Only the gamma 1 isozyme has been implicated in a signal transduction mechanism. This involves association with, and tyrosine phosphorylation by, the ligand-bound epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, probably by means of the PLC-gamma 1-specific src homology (SH2) domain. Because EGF receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 stimulates catalytic activity in vitro and G proteins have been implicated in the activation of PLC, we investigated which PLC isozymes are subject to G protein regulation. We have purified an activated G protein alpha subunit that stimulates partially purified phospholipase C and now report that this G protein specifically activates the beta 1 isozyme, but not the gamma 1 and delta 1 isozymes of phospholipase C. We also show that this protein is related to the Gq class of G protein alpha subunits.\r"

It is a stable state for a few proteins under particular conditions and could be a ubiquitous kinetic intermediate in protein folding. The extent to which native interactions, above the level of the secondary structure, are preserved in this conformation is not so far known. Here we report that alpha-lactalbumin can adopt a molten globule conformation when one of its four disulphide bonds is reduced. In this state, the three other disulphide bonds rearrange spontaneously, at the same rate as when the protein is fully unfolded, to a number of different disulphide bond isomers that tend to maintain the molten globule conformation. That the molten globule state is compatible with a variety of disulphide bond pairings suggests that it is unlikely to be stabilized by many specific tertiary interactions.\r"

One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study involving 13 investigative centers. Mean uterine volume decreased by 36% at 12 weeks and 45% at 24 weeks of leuprolide therapy. Patients treated with placebo had increased in mean uterine volume of 16% at 12 weeks and 5% at 24 weeks. Seventy-seven percent of leuprolide-treated patients had a more than 25% reduction in uterine volume, compared with 9% of placebo-treated controls. Mean uterine volume returned to pre-treatment size 24 weeks after cessation of leuprolide treatment. The majority of patients had resolution or improvement of their fibroid-related symptoms after 24 weeks of leuprolide treatment. Of 38 leuprolide-treated patients presenting with menorrhagia, 37 (97%) had resolution of this symptom at the time of the final visit. Although 95% of women treated with leuprolide acetate experienced some side effects related to hypoestrogenism, only five patients (8%) terminated treatment prematurely. We conclude that leuprolide acetate depot treatment of leiomyomata uteri is safe and causes significant but temporary reductions in uterine size and fibroid-related symptoms.\r"

  ".U": "91195273\r", 
  ".W": "Go is a specific class (\"other\") of signal-transducing heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) that is expressed in high levels in mammalian brain. We have cloned two different rat cDNAs encoding the alpha subunit of Go (Go alpha-1 and Go alpha-2) and a human Go alpha chromosomal gene. The human Go alpha gene spans more than 100 kilobases and contains 11 exons, including one noncoding exon in the 3' flanking region. The 5' flanking region is highly G + C-rich and contains five G.C boxes (Sp1 binding sites) but no TATA box. Exons 7 and 8 coding for amino acid residues 242-354 of Go alpha protein are duplicated (referred to as exons 7A, 7B, 8A, and 8B). It was found that exons 7A and 8A code for Go alpha-1, and 7B and 8B code for Go alpha-2. This indicates that two different Go alpha mRNAs may be generated by alternative splicing of a single Go alpha gene. The splice sites of the Go alpha-1 and Go alpha-2 genes are completely identical with those encoding human inhibitory G protein alpha subunits Gi2 alpha and Gi3 alpha [Itoh, H., Toyama, R., Kozasa, T., Tsukamoto, T., Matsuoka, M. & Kaziro, Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6656-6664] and also transducin G protein alpha subunit Gt1 alpha [Raport, C. J., Dere, B. & Hurley, J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7122-7128]. Sequence homology and conservation of the exon-intron organization indicate that the genes coding for Go alpha, Gi2 alpha, Gi3 alpha, Gt1 alpha, and probably Gi1 alpha may be evolved from a common progenitor. Like Go alpha-1, Go alpha-2 is expressed mainly in brain.\r"

  ".U": "91195274\r", 
  ".W": "Plasma membrane receptors that couple to guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) undergo a variety of rapid (minutes) and longer term (hours) regulatory processes induced by ligands. For the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR), the rapid processes include functional desensitization, mediated by phosphorylation of the receptor by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, as well as a loss of hydrophilic ligand binding proposed to represent sequestration of receptors into a cellular compartment distinct from the plasma membrane. The slower processes include beta 2AR down-regulation (i.e., a decrease in the total cellular complement of receptors). It is not yet known whether beta 2AR phosphorylation and/or sequestration are prerequisites for down-regulation of the receptor. Like other G protein-coupled receptors, the beta 2AR molecule spans the plasma membrane seven times, and the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain has been proposed to contain molecular determinants for each of these regulatory processes. We replaced four serine and threonine residues located within a 10-amino acid segment of this domain of beta 2AR and thereby prevented agonist-promoted phosphorylation, sequestration, and rapid desensitization of the adenylyl cyclase response. In contrast, these mutations did not affect functional coupling to the stimulatory G protein Gs or long-term down-regulation. These findings thus define a small, hitherto unappreciated region of the receptor molecule that may selectively subserve its rapid regulation. In addition, with the demonstration that beta 2AR does not have to be phosphorylated or sequestered in order to enter the down-regulation pathway, the results suggest that the classical receptor endocytosis model may not be appropriate for beta 2AR regulation.\r"

By using this indicator, we have isolated a 518-base-pair deletion, 312 base pairs upstream of the copia polyadenylylation site, that is phenotypically like much larger deletions and eliminates RNA species polyadenylylated in copia. This requirement of distant upstream sequences for copia polyadenylylation has implications for the expression of many genetic elements bearing long terminal repeats.\r"

This farnesylation reaction on a cysteine residue near the carboxyl terminus is followed by peptidase cleavage at the cysteine. Thus the modified cysteine becomes the carboxyl terminus. It is shown here that the free carboxyl group can be methylated by an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase associated with the rod outer segment membranes. This process can be inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and sinefungin. Moreover, synthetic N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine, but not N-acetyl-L-cysteine, is a substrate for the enzyme. Rapid demethylation of N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine methyl ester can be observed in the membranes. Transducin is also enzymatically demethylated by the rod outer segment membranes. Moreover, the 23- to 29-kDa small G proteins are methylated and demethylated in this system. These data suggest that methylation/demethylation may play a regulatory role in visual signal transduction.\r"

The retinoblastoma gene product, RB, also has properties of a cell-cycle regulatory factor. It remains underphosphorylated in the presence of TGF-beta and has been shown to repress the activity of the c-fos promoter, resulting in inhibition of transit through the cell cycle. These observations led us to examine effects of human RB on the expression of the human TGF-beta 1 gene. Using chimeric TGF-beta 1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene constructs, we show that RB induces TGF-beta 1 gene expression in CCL-64 mink lung epithelial cells and A-549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells but represses its expression in NIH 3T3 and AKR-2B mouse cells. Several sequences homologous to the c-fos RB control element were identified in the TGF-beta 1 promoter. These results demonstrate that human RB can regulate TGF-beta 1 gene expression negatively or positively depending on the cell type.\r"

A system incorporating a quantitative RNA.RNA hybridization assay that measures the amount of intracellular HIV-1-specific RNA has been employed to detect the level of inhibition by nucleoside analogues in sensitive and resistant HIV-1 strains. The RNA.RNA hybridization assay readily distinguished previously published zidovudine (ZDV; 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine)-resistant isolates from ZDV-sensitive isolates of HIV-1. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ZDV for HTLV-IIIB and sensitive clinical HIV-1 isolates is between 0.01 and 0.04 microM. HIV-1 strains from three patients on long-term ZDV therapy displayed a greater than 20-fold increase in the ZDV IC50 compared to sensitive strains. The drug sensitivity system was confirmed by showing that mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase gene from a ZDV-resistant isolate resulted in four amino acid changes (Leu-125----Trp, Ile-142----Val, Thr-215----Tyr, and Pro-294----Thr) including one change (Thr-215----Tyr) that has been previously reported to be associated with resistance. One clinical HIV strain with high-level ZDV resistance displayed a 5-fold increase in 2',3'-dideoxyinosine IC50 compared to that of HTLV-IIIB. A drug sensitivity assay employing RNA.RNA hybridization may be useful for extensive screening of HIV isolates from patients enrolled in clinical trials and permit the correlation of in vitro resistance with clinical outcome.\r"

We have identified the int gene and attP site of L5, characterized the chromosomal attachment site (attB), and constructed plasmid vectors that efficiently transform M. smegmatis through stable site-specific integration of the plasmid into the bacterial genome. These integration-proficient plasmids also efficiently transform slow-growing mycobacteria such as the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the vaccine strain bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). The ability to easily generate stable recombinants in these slow-growing mycobacteria without the requirement for continual selection is of particular importance for the construction of recombinant BCG vaccines and for the isolation and characterization of mycobacterial pathogenic determinants in animal model systems. Integration vectors of this type should be of general use in a number of additional bacterial systems where temperate phages have been identified.\r"

Biochemical analyses of purified recombinant arl-encoded protein revealed properties similar to the ARF proteins, including the ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Clear functional differences between arl and ARF proteins, including a complete lack of ARF activity, suggest that arl is not a functional homolog of ARF. A recessive lethal arl mutation was recovered, demonstrating that the arl locus is an essential gene. We conclude that the arl locus encodes an essential member of the ARF subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins in Drosophila.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of human thyrotropin beta subunit gene (TSHB) expression by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was examined in a clonal rat pituitary-cell line (GH3). Transient expression studies were done with various 5'-flanking DNA sequences of TSHB coupled to reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Deletion analysis defined two discrete regions (-128 to -92 base pairs and -28 to +8 base pairs) that each mediated an approximately 2-fold TRH induction. The upstream site contains a DNA sequence with close homology to the DNA-binding site for a pituitary-specific transcriptional factor Pit-1/GHF-1. DNase I footprinting analysis of mouse thyrotropic tumor extract as well as DNA-transfection studies using an expression vector containing an N-terminal deletion of Pit-1/GHF-1 cDNA suggest that Pit-1/GHF-1 or a closely related protein in the thyrotroph mediates TRH responsiveness of this gene. In addition, the downstream site overlaps with the recently characterized thyroid hormone-inhibitory element of TSHB. In fact, deletion of DNA sequences important in thyroid hormone-receptor binding (c-erbAB/c-ERBA2) from +3 to +8 base pairs, significantly reduced (30%) TRH responsiveness. The location of a TRH-stimulatory element near a thyroid hormone-inhibitory element may allow for fine control of TSHB expression in vivo.\r"

The major biochemical effect evoked by these receptors is the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. As a consequence, the activation of D2 receptors lowers the intracellular cAMP level. Two cDNAs, originated by alternative splicing of the same gene, have been isolated: D2A and D2B. They code for two proteins of 444 and 415 amino acids. These proteins display high affinity for selective D2 dopamine ligands. D2A differs from D2B by an insertion of 87 nucleotides in its cDNA, which is located in a region of the protein considered important for the coupling to G proteins. To investigate functional differences between the two dopamine D2 receptor isoforms, we transiently expressed them in cultured cells. To do so we developed an assay to study membrane receptors that are coupled to the adenylyl cyclase. Using this assay, we were able to show that the stimulation of the adenylyl cyclase induced by the activation of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor is inhibited more efficiently by D2B than D2A. The effects elicited by the D2 receptors are mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Treatment of transfected cells with pertussis toxin abolishes the inhibitory effects in a dose- and receptor isoform-dependent manner. Our results suggest that the two dopamine receptor isoforms are differentially coupled to G proteins.\r"

Microinjection of in vitro transcripts of the cloned cDNA into CHO cells confers a transient increase in intracellular calcium in response to endothelin 1, indicating that the receptor is functional and couples to the appropriate G protein(s).

Mol. Biol. 64, 565-579; Chaney, S. G. & Boyer, P. D. (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 64, 581-591] indicated that while RNA turnover in Escherichia coli was hydrolytic, it was nonhydrolytic in Bacillus subtilis. Here we provide an explanation for these observations based on enzymatic analysis of extracts of these two organisms. RNA degradation to the mononucleotide level in E. coli extracts is due solely to two active ribonucleases, RNase II and polynucleotide phosphorylase, which act hydrolytically and phosphorolytically, respectively. RNase II activity represents close to 90% of the total activity of the extract, as expected for predominantly hydrolytic degradation in this organism. In contrast, RNase II is absent from B. subtilis extracts, and the primary mode of RNA degradation is phosphorolytic, employing the Bacillus equivalent of polynucleotide phosphorylase and releases nucleoside diphosphates as products. A low level of a Mn2(+)-stimulated, hydrolytic ribonuclease is also detectable in B. subtilis extracts. Overall, E. coli and B. subtilis extracts differ by about 20- to 100-fold, depending on the substrate, in their relative use of hydrolytic and phosphorolytic routes of RNA degradation. The relation of the mode of mRNA degradation to the environment of the cell is discussed.\r"

An endopeptidase activity has been detected in detergent-solubilized inner membrane of P. aeruginosa and shown to correctly cleave the prepilin of P. aeruginosa and N. gonorrhoeae. It is absent from pilD mutants, increased by pilD overexpression, and conferred on Escherichia coli by the introduction of the pilD gene. The pilD gene product, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with antibody to a PilD-derived synthetic peptide, was identified with the endopeptidase. PilD appears to be a prototype of a class of enzymes that process not only type IV pilin precursors but also components of a protein-excretion apparatus of Gram-negative bacteria.\r"

IL-4 also up-regulates ICAM-1 antigen in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage but has no effect on ICAM-1 antigen expressed on basophils, fibroblasts, or lymphocytes. The increase in expression of mast cell/macrophage ICAM-1 antigen induced by IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of leukocytes and facilitate cell-contact-dependent regulation of immune cells in inflamed tissues.\r"

  ".U": "91195362\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work suggested that the structural gene for the A system transporter and the mRNA for the alpha subunit of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase in Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO-K1 [wild type (WT)] are coordinately controlled by regulatory gene R1. This conclusion was based on analysis of a mutant for the A system, alar4. This mutant had a constitutive level of A system transport activity equal to the level found in derepressed WT cells and a 4 times increase in abundance of the alpha 1 subunit of Na+,K(+)-ATPase mRNA over that found in repressed WT. The level of Na+ per cell in alar4 was not significantly greater than that found in the WT. To further characterize the likely coregulation of both genes, we have studied the A system activity and Na+,K(+)-ATPase mRNA alpha 1-subunit levels in cells grown under various conditions that result in repression or derepression of the A system in the WT. System A activity increased up to 2-3 times the basal transport rate (repressed state) and Na+,K(+)-ATPase mRNA alpha 1-subunit levels showed a 3-fold increase after amino acid starvation (derepressed state). These changes occurred along with a decrease in intracellular Na+ levels. N-Methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine, previously shown to be corepressors for the A system, prevented to a similar extent A system derepression and Na+,K(+)-ATPase mRNA alpha 1-subunit accumulation. On the other hand, phenylalanine and lysine, amino acids that are not corepressors of the A system, failed to significantly prevent derepression of both genes. Hybrids between the WT and alar4 have the phenotype of the WT when grown under repressed conditions. These results give further support to the proposition that both the A system transporter and mRNA for the alpha 1 subunit of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase are coordinately controlled by regulatory gene R1 and elevated Na+ concentrations are not involved. No Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was detected in derepressed cells. Activity was restored by the addition of monensin. However, this activity was no greater than that obtained in repressed cells. Indications are that the reduced Na+ content in derepressed cells inhibits Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity and that conditions that favored derepression do not allow for de novo synthesis of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase.\r"

A hybrid gene was constructed containing 2 kilobases of 5' flanking sequence from the synapsin I gene fused to the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and transfected into 12 different neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines. In general, expression of the chimeric reporter gene showed excellent correlation with endogenous expression of synapsin I in different neuronal cell lines, whereas transcription was low in all nonneuronal cell lines examined. The addition of the simian virus 40 enhancer promoted non-tissue-specific expression. Deletion mutagenesis of the synapsin I promoter revealed the presence of positive and negative sequence elements. A basal (constitutive) promoter that directs reporter gene expression in neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines was mapped to the region -115 to +47. The promoter region from -422 to -22 contains positive elements that upon fusion with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter potentiate its transcription in PC12 and neuroblastoma cells but not in Chinese hamster ovary cells.\r"

Fidelity measurements with two vectors having the origin of replication on opposite sides of the opal codon demonstrate that error rates for two different A.dCTP and T.dGTP mispairs increase when deoxyguanosine monophosphate is added to replication reaction mixtures or when the concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphates is increased. The data suggest that exonucleolytic proofreading occurs on both strands during bidirectional replication.

Gene markers for canarc-1 were therefore sought by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms in our colony of narcoleptic dogs. A human mu-switch immunoglobulin probe and the enzyme Hae III identified a gene cosegregating with canarc-1 in backcrossed animals (logarithm of odds scores: m = 24, Z max = 7.2 at theta = 0%). canarc-1 was also shown not to be tightly linked with the dog major histocompatibility complex (m = 40, Z less than -2 at theta less than 4.8%).

At high doses of UV light or mitomycin C, the MP lines survived less than 10% or less than 5% as well as parental cells, respectively. After UV irradiation, inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis was greater in MP than in parental cells, and recovery was slower or absent. A 2- to 3.5-fold increase in the frequency of UV-induced sister chromatid exchange was also seen in the four cell lines. In MP5, unscheduled DNA replication after treatment with UV light was only approximately 70% as great as in parental cells and the other MP lines. In MP4 and MP7 cells S phase was elongated. Although their individual properties confirm that the four cell lines are independent, their common properties suggest a relationship between tolerance of DNA damage and gene amplification.\r"

  ".W": "Dynamic contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) with intraarterial infusion of carbon dioxide microbubbles was performed for four cases of histologically proved focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in four patients and for 167 cases of various hepatic nodules in 144 patients. No complications due to dynamic US were observed in any of the 148 patients. All FNH nodules were less than 3 cm in diameter. Consistent specific findings of FNH were not obtained with US, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiocolloid scanning, or angiography in the four cases of FNH. In contrast, the characteristic vascular pattern (ie, early central hypervascular supply with centrifugal filling to the periphery at the arterial phase and a uniform or lobulated dense stain at the capillary phase) was observed in all four cases of FNH with dynamic US. This vascular pattern demonstrated in FNH with dynamic US was not seen in any of the 167 hepatic nodules, including 44 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 3 cm in diameter. Therefore, the newly developed, dynamic contrast-enhanced US technique seems to be extremely sensitive and specific for diagnosing FNH and is useful in the differentiation of FNH from other hepatic tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Seizures ceased upon reduction in dosage or discontinuation of the suspected offending agents. Imaging studies failed to reveal new structural lesions in the central nervous system in any patient, and only one had a history of neurologic disease. Although the exact mechanism for seizure induction cannot be determined from these cases, potential drug interactions exist, because theophylline, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin are all believed to increase excitation of the central nervous system by inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid binding to receptors. In addition, ciprofloxacin decreases the clearance of theophylline from the body, predisposing the patient to elevated theophylline levels. Physicians prescribing theophylline with imipenem, ciprofloxacin, or metronidazole should carefully monitor patients for indications for drug therapy, drug dosage, organ impairment affecting drug metabolism, and signs of toxicity. Seizures may accompany oral theophylline therapy, even at \"therapeutic\" serum theophylline concentrations.\r"

The use of adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis was also evaluated. In the 62 cases of tuberculosis confirmed histologically or by culture, or both, the BACTEC system had the same culture yield as conventional mycobacterial culture (positive in 14 cases-23%), but was significantly faster (18 versus 33 days). Bedside inoculation had a culture yield significantly higher than laboratory inoculation in the 24 patients tested (11 versus four). The remaining three diagnostic categories were malignant (28), miscellaneous (10), and undiagnosed (11). Median adenosine deaminase activity was significantly higher in tuberculous effusions than in any of the other categories, but there was considerable overlap between the groups. It is concluded that the BACTEC system is significantly faster than conventional mycobacterial culture and that bedside inoculation of pleural fluid substantially increases culture yield. Adenosine deaminase does not provide as valuable a diagnostic test of pleural tuberculosis as has been suggested.\r"

In all cases, diagnosis of clitoromegaly requires basic chromosomal and endocrinologic evaluation.

Because of an association with urinary tract neurofibromas, the patient with genital involvement should have cystoscopy. Clitoroplasty with sparing of the neurovascular bundle and glans is the preferred method of management of the enlarged clitoris.\r"

To determine the reliability of these reagents in predicting the genotype, 44 cases of NHL were studied with the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase technique with the use of the following MoAbs: leukocyte common antigen (CD45), Mac 387, L26, 4KB5, MB1, MB2, LN2, UCHL1, MT1, and MT2. The lineage of the neoplastic cells was determined in all cases by gene rearrangement studies for immunoglobulin heavy chain and for the T-cell receptor beta-chain. Genotypic results showed B-cell lineage in 33 cases (75%), T-cell lineage in 6 cases (14%), and mixed or undetermined lineage in 5 cases (11%). A concordance of lineage assignment by paraffin section immunophenotyping with gene rearrangement studies was observed in 37 of 39 (95%) lymphomas with an unequivocally defined genotype. MoAb L26 was the most sensitive in detecting B-cell genotype; MoAbs MT1 and UCHL1 were the most sensitive and specific, respectively, in detecting T-cell genotype. The authors conclude that lineage assignment of NHLs in paraffin sections is reflective of the corresponding genotype when an appropriate panel of MoAbs is used.\r"

The authors performed immunophenotypic and Southern blot analysis of the peripheral blood and tissue specimen of a patient with RS. Using immunoperoxidase and immunogold-silver staining techniques and a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the authors found that the large cells characteristic of RS showed an altered immunophenotype as compared with the CLL cells and did not express mu heavy chain. Southern blot analysis revealed identical kappa light chain rearrangements in both tumoral cell populations consistent with a common clonal origin. Using the JH probe and several restriction enzymes, the authors also found evidence for a postrearrangement deletion of the heavy chain mu gene. These findings suggest that in this case of RS, a deletion of the heavy chain mu gene resulted in loss of mu expression by the larger cells that were characteristic of RS and was associated with their altered phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "A sensitive and specific, monoclonal antibody-based immunoquantification assay has facilitated determination of the N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (4-sulfatase) protein content in cultured fibroblasts from normal controls and mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) patients. The assay enabled the quantification of 4-sulfatase protein by using a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies and has shown that fibroblasts from 16 MPS VI patients contained less than or equal to 5% of the level determined for normal controls. Fibroblasts from the most severely affected patients contained the lowest levels of 4-sulfatase protein, usually with few epitopes detected, while fibroblasts from mildly affected patients had higher levels of 4-sulfatase protein, with all seven epitopes detected. The pattern of epitope expression is proposed to reflect the conformational changes in the 4-sulfatase protein that arise from different mutations in the 4-sulfatase gene. Immunoquantification in combination with a specific and highly sensitive 4-sulfated trisaccharide-based assay of enzyme activity in these MPS VI patient fibroblasts enabled the determination of residual 4-sulfatase catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). The capacity of fibroblasts to degrade substrate (catalytic capacity) was calculated as the product of 4-sulfatase catalytic efficiency and the content of 4-sulfatase in fibroblasts. One patient, 2357, with no clinical signs of MPS VI but with reduced 4-sulfatase activity and protein (both 5% of normal) and dermatansulfaturia, had 5% of normal catalytic capacity. The other 15 MPS VI patient fibroblasts had 0%-1.4% of the catalytic capacity of fibroblasts from normal controls and were representative of the spectrum of MPS VI clinical phenotypes, from severe to mild.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91196732\r", 
  ".W": "Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a liver glycoprotein that transports thyroid hormone in serum. In 1987 a variant TBG was discovered in an infant born in Quebec, following an investigation prompted by the finding of low blood thyroxine (T4) level on screening for neonatal hypothyroidism. This variant, TBG-Quebec, has cathodal shift on isoelectric focusing, reduced affinity for thyroxine, and markedly reduced stability. The latter property of the variant molecule is probably responsible for the partial TBG deficiency. We now report the results of sequencing of the entire coding region and exon-intron junctions of TBG-Quebec, which revealed two nucleotide substitutions; one, located in exon 3, changes the normal codon 283 of TTG (leucine) to that of TTT (phenylalanine), and the other, in exon 4, results in the replacement of the normal histidine-331 (CAT) by tyrosine (TAT). Allele-specific amplification (ASA) confirmed the cosegregation of the two nucleotide substitutions with the TBG-Quebec phenotype in individual members of this family. The substitution in codon 283, but not that in codon 331, has been previously described and, when occurring alone, does not alter the properties of the gene product. Thus, it appears that the replacement of histidine-331 by tyrosine is responsible for the observed altered properties of TBG-Quebec. However, the question of whether substitution of both amino acids is necessary for expression of the variant phenotype has yet to be answered.\r"

  ".W": "Genome regions containing multiple copies of homologous genes, such as the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain constant-region (IGHC) locus, are often unstable and give rise to duplicated and deleted haplotypes. Analysis of such processes is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of evolution of multigene families. In the IGHC region, a number of single and multiple gene deletions, derived from either unequal crossing-over or looping-out excision, have been described. To study these haplotypes at the population level, a simple and efficient method for preparing large numbers of DNA samples suitable for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was set up, and a sample of 110 blood donors was screened. Deletions were found to be frequent, as expected on the basis of previous serological surveys for homozygotes. Furthermore, a number of multigene duplications, never identified before, were detected. The total frequency of individuals bearing rearranged IGHC haplotypes was 10%. The genes involved in these deletions and duplications were assessed by densitometric analysis of standard Southern blots hybridized with several IGHC probes; two types of deletion and two types of duplication could thus be characterized. These data provide further evidence of the instability of the IGHC locus and demonstrate that unequal crossing-over is the most likely origin of rearranged IGHC haplotypes; they also suggest that such recombination events may be relatively frequent. Moreover, the simplicity and effectiveness of the large-scale PFGE screening approach will be of great help in the study of multigene families and of other loci involved in aberrant recombinations.\r"

  ".W": "Reports of families with members affected with both von Willebrand disease (vWD) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) suggest a possible relationship between these two disorders. vWD, the most common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, is due to either a quantitative or qualitative defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF). The gene for vWF has been cloned and mapped to chromosome 12 (12p12----12pter). HHT, an uncommon inherited bleeding disorder, is characterized by malformed, dilated, fragile blood vessels. The chromosomal location of the gene for HHT is unknown. We studied two families by RFLP analysis to determine whether there is a molecular basis for the association of vWD and HHT. Family A is affected with both type IIA vWD and HHT; family B is affected with HHT alone. Linkage of HHT to the vWF gene was not detected, and vWF was ruled out as a candidate gene for HHT. The vWF gene was found to be tightly linked to type IIA vWD in family A (lod score 3.61 at recombination fraction .00). By PCR and DNA sequence analysis of vWF exon 28, a single T----C transition resulting in the substitution of Thr for Ile865 was identified. This substitution is located immediately adjacent to two previously identified type IIA vWD mutations.\r"

Serum muromonab CD3-specific IgG and IgE antibodies were detected in serum samples obtained after the anaphylactic reaction. The anaphylactic reaction to muromonoab CD3 monoclonal antibody could have been due to allergen-specific antibodies noted in postreaction serum or a cross-reactive antibody to mouse antigens or both. More importantly, this case illustrates that rapid desensitization can be performed successfully without serious complications; therefore, systemic anaphylaxis can develop in susceptible atopic individuals receiving muromonab CD3 monoclonal antibody for renal graft rejection.\r"

Binding of the radiolabeled conjugate to cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages at 4 degrees C was competed for by MBSA but not by PAS. At 37 degrees C, the radiolabeled conjugate was rapidly degraded by the macrophages, leading to release of acid-soluble degradation products in the medium. The drug conjugate was nearly 100 times as effective as free PAS in killing the intracellular mycobacteria in mouse peritoneal macrophages infected in culture with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The killing of intracellular mycobacteria mediated by the drug conjugate was effectively prevented by simultaneous addition of excess MBSA (100 micrograms/ml) or chloroquine (3 microM) to the medium, whereas these agents did not affect the microbicidal action of free PAS. These results suggest that (i) uptake of the PAS-MBSA conjugate was mediated by cell surface receptors on macrophages which recognize MBSA and (ii) lysosomal hydrolysis of the internalized conjugate resulted in intracellular release of a pharmacologically active form of the drug, which led to selective killing of the M. tuberculosis harbored by mouse macrophages infected in culture. This receptor-mediated modality of delivering drugs to macrophages could contribute to greater therapeutic efficacy and minimization of toxic side effects in the management of tuberculosis and other intracellular mycobacterial infections.\r"

We developed an assay for attachment of radiolabeled trophozoites to IEC-6 cells that can be done in microtiter trays. Attachment was confirmed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Trophozoites remained attached to the IEC-6 cells for 24 h with little evidence of damage to the IEC-6 cells. Preincubation of trophozoites with cytochalasins A, B, and D reduced attachment to approximately 20% of that of controls, whereas colchicine had no effect. Chelation of divalent cations with EDTA and EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid] reduced attachment to 24 and 26% of control values, respectively, and incubation at 4 degrees C reduced attachment to 7% of the value for controls incubated at 37 degrees C. Glutaraldehyde fixation of trophozoites or IEC-6 cells resulted in significantly diminished attachment to the live substrate (17 and 40% of control values, respectively). Coincubation of IEC-6 cells and trophozoites on a rotary shaker resulted in detachment of 40% of trophozoites, but EDTA, EGTA, glutaraldehyde fixation of trophozoites, and low temperature diminished attachment markedly and significantly. Similar results were obtained in selected experiments with three strains of giardia.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of anticandidal action of novel synthetic dipeptides containing N3-(4-methoxyfumaroyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (FMDP) residues was shown to be consistent with the \"warhead delivery\" concept. FMDP dipeptides were shown to be transported into Candida albicans cells by the di-tripeptide permease and subsequently hydrolyzed by intracellular peptidases, especially aminopeptidase. The anticandidal activity of the particular FMDP dipeptide was influenced by the rate of its transport and, to a lower extent, by the intracellular cleavage rate. A high transport rate accompanied by a high cleavage rate resulted in the high anticandidal activity of L-norvalyl-FMDP. The strong growth-inhibitory effect of this compound was the consequence of inhibition of the enzyme glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase by the released FMDP. The action of L-norvalyl-FMDP on exponentially growing C. albicans cells resulted in a sharp decrease of incorporation of 14C label from [14C]glucose into chitin, mannoprotein, and glucan. This effect, as well as the growth-inhibitory effect, was fully reversed by exogenous N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase was proved to be the only essential target for FMDP dipeptides. Scanning electron microscopy of C. albicans cells treated with L-norvalyl-FMDP revealed highly distorted, wrinkled, and collapsed forms. Cells formed long, bulbous chains, and partial lysis occurred.\r"

Hybridization studies revealed the presence of homologous sequences in the DNAs of several Streptomyces strains and Nocardia lactamdurans. The S. griseus pcbC gene was not expressed in Streptomyces lividans but was expressed in Streptomyces clavuligerus and complemented a mutation, nce2, that impaired isopenicillin N synthase and cephamycin biosynthesis. The pcbC gene contained an open reading frame of 990 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 329 amino acids with a deduced Mr of 37,371. The isopenicillin N synthase formed after expression of the pcbC gene in the S. clavuligerus nce2 mutant strain was found to have an Mr of 38,000 by gel filtration. A protein of about 38 kDa was observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of extracts of a transformant of the nce2 mutant strain; this protein was absent from the untransformed mutant strain. The G+C content of the pcbC gene was 63.6%, and the strongly biased codon usage was typical of that of Streptomyces strains. A transcription initiation site was found 44 nucleotides upstream of the ATG translation initiation triplet. A transcript of 1.1 kb was observed in the donor S. griseus strain and also in the S. clavuligerus nce2 mutant strain transformed with the pcbC gene, suggesting that it is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA.\r"

In studies of the inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha (Wellferon) on acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of human T-cell lines, we found that in C3 cells, the 50% effective concentration was 9 U/ml and the 90% effective concentration was 310 U/ml. There was no apparent accumulation of intracellular particles detected by p24 antigen levels or by processing the cells for electron microscopy. Extracellular reverse transcriptase activity and p24 levels decreased in parallel with increasing IFN, whereas the intracellular viral proteins decreased only slightly. By electron microscopy, cells treated with higher concentrations of IFN (512 U/ml) disclosed very few particles budding into extracellular spaces; no intracellular particles could be seen, despite nearly normal levels of intracellular viral protein detected by the p24 antigen assay and correct processing detected by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. Thus in human immunodeficiency virus-infected cells, the major block produced by IFN-alpha appeared to be late in the viral cycle at the morphogenesis stage of virion production. Chronically infected Jurkat cells treated with IFN appeared to be inhibited in growth rate, as virus production decreased proportionally with cell number.\r"

Plaque and dye uptake assays were used to measure the MICs against R. rickettsii and R. conorii. The susceptibilities of C. burnetii Nine Mile and Q 212 were determined in two acute-infection models and in two chronic-infection models. The MICs were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for R. rickettsii and 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml for R. conorii. Sparfloxacin (1 microgram/ml) cured cells recently infected with C. burnetii Nine Mile and Q 212 within 4 to 9 days and cured multiplying, persistently infected cells within 10 days. As previously described with other fluoroquinolones (D. Raoult, M. Drancourt, and G. Vestris, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 34:1512-1514, 1990), sparfloxacin failed to cure cells persistently infected with C. burnetii and blocked from dividing with cycloheximide. As determined by the dye uptake assay, no cellular toxicity was noted with sparfloxacin at up to 128 micrograms/ml. These results are consistent with those previously obtained with fluoroquinolones (D. Raoult, M. Yeaman, and O. Baca, Rev. Infect. Dis. 11[Suppl. 5]:S986, 1989), although sparfloxacin may be slightly more active.\r"

Transfection of Vero cells with a similar construct employing the human metallothionein promoter led to the isolation of stable cell lines exhibiting inducible viruslike particle expression in response to cadmium chloride treatment. Induction ratios for viruslike particle expression were in excess of 1000-fold with production levels of p24 core antigen as high as 0.6 mg/L per 24 h. HIV-1 viruslike particles were immunogenic in mice, leading to strong envelope and core-specific humoral responses after two immunizations. The development of stable cell lines expressing significant quantities of HIV-1 viruslike particles offers an alternative to the use of live virus vectors for the production and evaluation of particle-based AIDS vaccines.\r"

The similar particles containing gag and env proteins were produced into the culture medium when the cells were coinfected with vC5 and vE234L strains. The particles contained heterogeneous cellular RNA, but no virus-specific RNA as shown by Northern blot hybridization. Immunization of the rabbits with purified viruslike particles produced virus-specific antibodies against gag and env proteins. The titer of antibodies was significantly higher than after immunization with cell lysate or recombinant proteins purified from the infected cells. Highly immunogenic HIV-1-like particles containing gag and env proteins but no virus-specific RNA are good candidates for potential vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and LFA-1 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-induced cell fusion was investigated in subclones of a T-cell leukemic cell line (CEM) with differing abilities to form syncytia. Addition of monoclonal antibodies 84H10 directed against ICAM-1 and MHM23 directed against the common beta subunit of LFA-1 (CD18) resulted in greater than 50% suppression of syncytia formation in cultures of these clones infected with cell-free virus. Two subclones, 2G5-144-84 and 2G5-1, were deficient in their ability to form syncytia and expressed reduced amounts of LFA-1 compared with the parental line. The expression of ICAM-1 but not LFA-1 was upregulated on the clones following treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma); however, this did not overcome the delay in syncytia formation observed in these cells. The syncytia-positive subclones 1B11-39 and 17D-9 expressed high levels of LFA-1. Basal expression of ICAM-1 was upregulated on these cells by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), which also accelerated and enhanced syncytia formation. However, anti-ICAM-1 and anti-LFA-1 (CD18) antibodies did not reverse the TNF alpha-induced enhancement of syncytia formation of HIV-1-infected clones 1B11-39 and 17D-9. Under conditions of low viral expression, adhesion molecules may contribute to syncytia formation if adequate levels of both receptor and ligand in the ICAM-1/LFA-1 complex are expressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By using synthetic peptides, cross-reacting epitopes were mapped and three regions were defined. The conserved immunogenic sites were located in the carboxyterminal region of the protein. Inhibition experiments with human sera showed that this region is also immunogenic in humans.\r"

Both groups had carried out traditional postpartum practices of salt consumption and body heating. Plasma concentrations (mean (SEM)) of atrial natriuretic peptide were significantly higher in the seven patients with peripartum heart failure (146.9 (24.3) pg/ml) than in the seven controls (4.4 (0.8) pg/ml). Both plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity were suppressed in the patients with peripartum heart failure. After treatment for the heart failure plasma atrial natriuretic peptide fell considerably and there were associated increases in plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity. The high plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide may have been a compensatory response to salt and water retention as well as to the heart failure. These high concentrations could also, in part, have suppressed the release of aldosterone and renin in an attempt to correct for volume overload.\r"

One percent of the spore bearing organism, Bacillus subtilis, was still viable after 30 min contact. Although Bacillus subtilis is an organism of low pathogenicity, spores may be more resistant to the alkaline medium of the soda-lime. The micro-organisms were observed to lodge in all components of the breathing system, with the greatest concentration being recovered from the corrugated tubing. We recommend that disposable components of the circle breathing system should be changed, and the non-disposable parts sterilized or disinfected, daily. Soda-lime cannisters should be sterilized or disinfected when changing the soda-lime.\r"

During uptake, an arterial partial pressure (Paiso) which is considerably less than PE'iso (Paiso/PE'iso much less than 1) leads to underestimation of depth of anaesthesia and, during elimination, PE'iso/Paiso much less than 1 will lead to an overestimation of anaesthetic depth. We measured Paiso/PE'iso during a 60-min uptake period of 1% isoflurane and PE'iso/Paiso during the subsequent 60-min elimination period in 26 patients (age 13-88 yr, ASA I-III) undergoing various surgical procedures. After 15 min of isoflurane uptake, Paiso/PE'iso of 26 patients was mean 0.78 (SD 0.10) and this increased only marginally at 60 min (0.79 (0.09)), whereas during elimination, PE'iso/Paiso was in the range 0.79 (0.14)-0.83 (0.11). Predictability of Paiso in a given patient is hindered by the high SD of Paiso/PE'iso and PE'iso/Paiso, but it may be improved by taking into account age, ASA physical status category, vital capacity, inspired minus end-tidal isoflurane partial pressure and arterial minus end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure during uptake; and obesity, end-tidal isoflurane partial pressure and arterial minus end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure during elimination. However, even with multiple regression analysis (to account for the various possible variables), clinically useful prediction of Paiso/PE'iso and PE'iso/Paiso in a particular patient is not possible (residual SD 0.084 and 0.113, respectively).\r"

Ligation of the thoracic duct and pleurectomy were performed subsequently to reduce the large daily losses of chyle, amounting to nearly three times the child's circulating blood volume. Brawny oedema of the right upper quadrant of the body developed rapidly after the duct ligation and right pleurectomy. A further period of conservative treatment was required before the latter complication resolved. The literature relating to this iatrogenic complication and to fluid and nutritional losses in paediatric chylothorax is reviewed and discussed.\r"

We examined the direct effect of recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) and recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) on the growth and function of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS) increased the proliferation of passaged and primary cells by 305% +/- 45% (mean +/- SEM, n = 5, P less than .01) over control cells at 4 days; GM-CSF and G-CSF had no effect. Endothelial cell procoagulant activity was increased after 4-hour incubation with recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) 10 U/mL and recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 10 U/mL to 1,721% +/- 376% (n = 7, P less than .005) and 247% +/- 71% (n = 4) of control levels, respectively. gamma-Interferon (gamma-IFN) 50 U/mL had no direct effect of its own but was able to prime the response to IL-1 beta. There was no direct or priming effect of GM-CSF (1 ng to 1 microgram/mL) on the expression of procoagulant activity in endothelial cells. GM-CSF and G-CSF (1 ng/mL to 1 microgram/mL) had no effect on the expression of either tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by endothelial cells. The secretion of tPA by endothelial cells was increased, however, after 24-hour incubation with thrombin 4 U/mL (314% +/- 72% of control levels, n = 5, P less than .025). The production of PAI-1 was increased by TNF 200 U/mL (241% +/- 44% of control, n = 3, P less than .005), thrombin 4 U/mL (180% +/- 12% of control, n = 5, P less than .0005) and IL-1 beta 10 U/mL (275% +/- 44% of controls, n = 5, P less than .0005). In four experiments, endothelial cells showed no specific binding of 125I-GM-CSF, whereas peripheral blood (PB) neutrophils demonstrated the presence of 802 +/- 78 high-affinity receptors for GM-CSF. Thus, we found no effect of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF on the proliferation activities by these cells. These findings are in accordance with the lack of demonstrable receptors for GM-CSF on cultured HUVEC.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined alpha/beta V gene segment usage of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, from patients with multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, by using T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). In 7 of 16 patients we found an increase in the usage of various TCR V gene segments. The expansion was confined to either the CD4+ or the CD8+ T-cell subset, except for one patient where an abnormal pattern was observed both within the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets. In one patient 47%, and in another patient 30% of the CD8+ lymphocytes reacted with alpha V12.1 and beta V6.7 antibodies, respectively. In two other patients 29% and 40% of the CD4+ lymphocytes reacted with beta V6.7 and beta V8.1 antibodies, respectively. We conclude that T cells with a predominant V gene usage is a frequent feature in patients with abnormal clonal B cells of malignant or benign types. T- and B-cell populations are normally clonally linked in regulatory circuits. An abnormal proliferation of B cells might therefore induce, or be regulated by, an expansion of clonal T cells, as suggested by the present results.\r"

In all, 411 patients admitted to a district general hospital during a 10-month period were managed using a standard protocol incorporating these techniques. After initial assessment by a surgical registrar, 151 patients were excluded from further progress through the protocol (age less than 16 years, definite diagnosis made or contraindication to FCPC. The remaining 260 patients were placed in one of four management groups: (A) urgent operation (23 patients); (B) 'look and see' (40 patients); (C) 'wait and see' (59 patients); (D) urgent operation not indicated (138 patients). Eighty-eight of 99 patients (88 per cent) in groups B and C, where the need for operation was uncertain, underwent successful FCPC and 39 patients (39 per cent) underwent laparoscopy. In these patients the initial registrar management decision proved to be incorrect in 33 cases (33 per cent), but by following the protocol the number of management errors actually made was reduced to 13 (13 per cent, P less than 0.001). This would have been reduced to 8 per cent if the protocol had not been violated in five patients. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a protocol using FCPC and laparoscopy to improve the management of patients with acute abdominal pain.\r"

Patients received cisplatin (50 mg/m2/wk) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 36, 43, 50, and 57 combined with mitomycin C (8 mg/m2) on days 1 and 36, vinblastine (3 mg/m2) on days 8 and 43, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (1 g/m2) by continuous infusion over 24 hours on days 15 and 50. Responding patients received consolidation therapy with cisplatin and etoposide (VP-16). Of 82 registered patients, 80 were eligible and 77 were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 23% with 1 patient achieving a complete response (CR) and 17 patients achieving a partial response (PR). The median survival time was 4.6 months. The toxicity profile was not different from that described for standard-dose regimens. Although this regimen does not offer any benefit over standard-dose cisplatin regimens for patients with extensive non-small lung cancer, the weekly schedule permits a dose-intensive regimen with acceptable toxicity for tumors that may benefit from this approach.\r"

  ".W": "Preclinical data from studies of human lung cancer xenografts suggest that the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin are enhanced by alpha-interferon. To verify the above observations, the authors initiated a Phase II trial in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cisplatin was given at 100 mg/m2 during a 28-day cycle in a divided day 1 and day 8 schedule. Starting on day 1, alpha-2B interferon was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 5 million units three times a week continuously for a minimum of 2 months. Between January 1989 and September 1989, 30 patients were evaluated for response and toxicity. According to the staging system proposed by Mountain, 20 patients had Stage IV disease, 7 had Stage IIIB disease, and 3 had Stage IIIA disease. Expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Leu-7 was immunohistochemically investigated to evaluate possible relationship to treatment response. The response rate was 13.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2% to 25%). The four responders showed positivity for NSE, and two of them were positive for Leu-7. An average of three cycles was given. The mean dose intensity administered was 83% of the projected dose for cisplatin and 92% of the projected dose for alpha-2B interferon. A standard scale was used to assess interferon toxicity. Hematologic, renal, and systemic side effects were not significant. In advanced NSCLC the addition of alpha-2B interferon did not increase the cisplatin-induced response rate. Further studies should be performed to determine the real value of chemotherapy response in tumors showing positive immunoreactivity for neural markers such as NSE and Leu-7.\r"

The proliferating lymphocytes share large granular lymphocyte natural killer cell and T-lymphocyte characteristics. They are either of monoclonal or polyclonal origin. In this report the familial occurrence of a similar syndrome observed in two children is described. Lymphocyte morphologic abnormalities including nuclear pockets, were noted, a feature usually present in leukemic cells. Lymphocyte proliferation was distinct in each case as shown by the presence of a predominant CD4+ cell population in one and a predominant CD8+ population in the other. Monoclonal gene rearrangements of T-cell receptor beta-chain gene were found although clonal variations occurred with time in one patient. The cause of this unique familial occurrence of monoclonal lymphoproliferation associated with neutropenia is unknown.\r"

Placebo had no ventilatory effects. Diazepam had no effect on resting ventilation but depressed response to CO2. Buspirone had no effect on resting ventilation or CO2 response. During loading, buspirone did not alter the augmentation of mouth pressure; diazepam produced a trend toward less augmentation. Both anxiolytics altered the load compensation response for the group; in particular, an increase in ventilation during loading (seen in three of nine subjects) was suppressed by drug administration. Diazepam also markedly depressed one subject's loaded ventilation below unloaded ventilation. In summary, buspirone did not cause the depression of respiratory center chemosensitivity that was seen with diazepam and produced less depression of load compensation in normal subjects. This suggests that it may be a safer anxiolytic in patients with lung disease.\r"

  ".W": "Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are critically important mediators of many signal-transduction systems. Several important sites regulating stimulus-secretion coupling and release of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells are modulated by G proteins. Gs mediates increases in intracellular cAMP associated with hormone-induced stimulation of insulin secretin. Gi mediates decreases in intracellular cAMP caused by inhibitors of insulin secretion, e.g., epinephrine, somatostatin, prostaglandin E2, and galanin. G proteins also regulate ion channels, phospholipases, and distal sites in exocytosis. Cholera and pertussis toxins irreversibly ADP ribosylate G proteins and are important tools that can be used both to manipulate G-protein-dependent modulators of insulin secretion and detect and quantify G proteins by electrophoretic techniques. The stage is set to pursue these initial observations in greater depth and ascertain whether G-protein research will provide important new insights into normal and abnormal regulation of insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine and prostaglandins of the E series inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes by binding to cell surface receptors. This inhibition is mediated via Gi. It has been reported that Gi is almost absent in livers from diabetic rats. Therefore, we have evaluated the sensitivity of adipocytes from diabetic rats to the adenosine analogue N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine (PIA) and to prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Diabetes was induced with streptozocin (65 mg/kg i.v.), and after 7 days, adipocytes were isolated. Lipolysis (measured in the presence of adenosine deaminase) was inhibited by PIA and PGE1 in both control and diabetic cells. However, the dose-response curves were markedly shifted to the right in the cells from diabetic rats. The IC50 for PIA was 0.30 +/- 0.02 nM in controls and 0.83 +/- 0.08 in diabetic rats (P less than 0.001), and the IC50 for PGE1 was 3.16 +/- 0.18 nM in controls and 5.26 +/- 0.57 nM in diabetic rats (P less than 0.02). These findings indicate decreased sensitivity to both adenosine and PGE1. Adipocyte membranes were isolated from control and diabetic rats. Adenosine receptors (measured by binding of 125I-labeled hydroxy-PIA) were not altered in cells from diabetic rats. However, the ability of Gpp(NH)p (a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue) to inhibit adenosine-receptor binding was markedly decreased in membranes from diabetic rats, suggesting a change at the level of Gi. The alpha-subunits of Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, and Gs were quantitated on Western blots with a series of recently characterized anti-peptide antisera. This revealed that the amounts of each of these G proteins were normal in membranes from the diabetic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The poor growth associated with protein-calorie malnutrition occurs despite circulating growth hormone levels that are normal or elevated and is thought to be mediated partly by blunted generation of insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) in the liver. To explore underlying mechanisms, we asked whether altered availability of amino acids could regulate hepatic IGF-I release independent of the contributions of regulatory hormones. Normal rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion and maintained in serum-free medium with fixed concentrations of insulin and dexamethasone. Levels of immunoassayable albumin and IGF-I accumulation in daily changes of medium were sustained for 3-5 days, and all studies were performed within this period. Cellular viability and content of DNA were unaffected by deprivation of the essential amino acids lysine or tryptophan and the nonessential amino acids cysteine and/or cystine. However, deletion of tryptophan or lysine from the culture medium led to 63 and 76% declines in IGF-I release, respectively (both P less than 0.001 vs. complete medium), although omission of cysteine or cysteine plus cystine produced no significant change. Over 5 days of culture, release of albumin was maintained in complete medium, but omission of tryptophan depressed albumin release over days 2-5 (P less than 0.001). In complete medium, IGF-I release rose for 3 days and then declined. In tryptophan-deficient medium, IGF-I levels were comparable to control values after 24 h but did not rise at 48 h and then fell rapidly after 72 h in culture, with values significantly below levels in complete medium (all P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Smooth muscle cell proliferation is central to the process of restenosis. Attempts to inhibit the events leading to this proliferation have met with little success. In addition to its known antithrombotic effects, heparin also has inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation. These effects appear to be unrelated to its anticoagulant properties and are retained in low molecular weight heparin derivatives. Although the use of heparin for as long as 18 to 24 h after coronary angioplasty in humans has not prevented restenosis, longer treatment periods have not been assessed. This study examines the effect of treatment with a low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit iliac artery model. Control rabbits had a mean iliac artery diameter of 0.70 +/- 0.06 mm, which increased to 1.73 +/- 0.09 mm after balloon angioplasty. At follow-up angiography 4 weeks later, the mean vessel diameter was 0.56 +/- 0.12 mm. Animals treated with low dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks and high dose enoxaparin (10 mg/kg per day) for either 2 or 4 weeks had similar mean luminal diameters before and immediately after angioplasty. At follow-up angiography, the mean luminal diameter was 0.82 +/- 0.17 mm for low dose enoxaparin, 1.04 +/- 0.20 mm for 2 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.03 versus control) and 1.19 +/- 0.09 mm for 4 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.001 versus control). When defined as loss of 50% of the initial gain achieved with angioplasty, restenosis was found in all control vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thrombin binds to arterial wall matrix and fibrin within a thrombus. Heparin dose-dependently decreases platelet and thrombus deposition but does not eliminate these even at high doses. Specific thrombin inhibition started before angioplasty experimentally prevents mural thrombus and limits platelet deposition to a single layer or less. Experimentally, anticoagulant and antifibrin effects occur at lower antithrombin blood levels and lower activated partial thromboplastin times (1.7 times control). Because platelets are so sensitive to thrombin, the higher level of thrombin inhibition required may occur at a specific level (activated partial thromboplastin time greater than or equal to 2 times control); this is not defined in humans. The duration of therapy is not defined in animals or humans. Thrombus and thrombin may be related to cellular proliferation.\r"

Yet, the killing of K562 can be specifically induced by antibodies to CD3 or delta-chains. Although this phenomenon may be caused by redirected lysis, it also raised the possibility that K562 may possess ligands capable of specifically interacting with the gamma/delta receptor. We found that K562 specifically induced both CD3 and delta modulation as well as IL-2R expression and IL-2 production by gamma/delta cells, supporting the idea that the TCR-gamma/delta is specifically triggered by K562 cells. Moreover, although the gamma/delta cell clones lysed other target cells (e.g., Molt 4, U937, Jurkat etc.), these latter targets did not induce delta modulation or IL-2R expression. In addition, F(ab)2 anti-CD3 antibodies inhibited activated gamma/delta T cells from killing K562 but did not inhibit the lysis of the other targets. Taken together, these results suggest that gamma/delta cells lyse some targets by utilizing receptors (perhaps NK-like) distinct from the gamma/delta receptor. We also found that triggering of the gamma/delta receptor by K562 inhibited the capacity of resting gamma/delta to lyse Molt 4 cells under conditions in which the K562 cells were not lysed. These findings suggest that the gamma/delta receptor maybe directly involved in the lysis of certain targets (i.e., K562) and, importantly, may potentially regulate the function of NK-like receptors that are involved in the lysis of other targets.\r"

In general, T cell responses to SE are MHC class II dependent (presumably reflecting the ability of SE to bind directly to MHC class II molecules) and restricted to responding cells expressing certain T cell receptor beta-chain variable (TCR V beta) domains. Recently we demonstrated that CD8+ CTL expressing appropriate TCR V beta could recognize SE presented on MHC class II-bearing target cells. We now show that MHC class II expression is not strictly required for T cell recognition of SE. Both human and mouse MHC class II negative target cells could be recognized (i.e., lysed) in a SE-dependent fashion by CD8+ mouse CTL clones and polyclonal populations, provided that the CTL expressed appropriate TCR V beta elements. SE-dependent lysis of MHC class II negative targets by CTL was inhibited by mAb directed against CD3 or LFA-1, suggesting that SE recognition was TCR and cell contact dependent. Furthermore, different SE were recognized preferentially by CTL on MHC class II+ vs MHC class II- targets. Taken together, our data raise the possibility that SE binding structures distinct from MHC class II molecules may exist.\r"

  ".W": "MLR in various combinations with class I H-2 disparity revealed that there are three patterns of MLR in the aspect of responding T subset (CD4 vs CD8) dominance. Irrespective of the CD8 vs CD4 dominance, a single i.v. administration of class I-disparate allogeneic spleen cells resulted in almost complete abrogation of anti-class I proliferative capacity of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in six combinations. The suppression of proliferative responses was correlated with the striking reduction in the ability to produce IL-2 upon stimulation with the relevant class I alloantigens. In contrast, i.v. presensitized recipient mice exhibiting only marginal MLR/Il-2 production could generate comparable magnitudes of anti-allo class I CTL as well as graft rejection responses to those induced by normal unpresensitized mice. The administration in vivo of anti-CD4 antibody along with the i.v. presensitization not only suppressed the generation of CTL responses by spleen cells but also induced appreciable prolongation of allo-class I-disparate skin grafts under conditions in which neither alone did it. These results demonstrate that 1) the suppression of graft rejection responses is not necessarily reflected on the reduction of MLR; 2) CD8+ CTL precursors responsible for graft rejection can be activated by either allo-class I-reactive CD8+ or CD4+ Th cells; 3) i.v. presensitization induces functional elimination of CD8+ and CD4+ proliferative/IL-2-producing T cells but not of CD8+ CTL precursors and CD4+ Th whose capacity is expressed by assistance of CTL induction but not by their own proliferation. Thus, this study illustrates the heterogeneity of class I alloantigen-reactive CD4+ T cells in the aspect of their capacity to proliferate themselves vs contribute to CTL induction as well as graft rejection.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of CD3/TCR V gamma 3 moieties on both dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC) and fetal murine thymocytes has led to the concept that fetal thymocytes expressing this particular TCR phenotype are the actual DETC precursors. To test this assumption, we injected i.v. thymocyte suspensions prepared from day 16 and day 19 fetal mice as well as from adult animals, into syngeneic and Thy-1-disparate nude mice, the epidermis of which contains only Thy-1+/CD3- lymphocytes. Phenotypic analysis of the recipient epidermis by in situ immunolabeling revealed that injection of day 16 and day 19 fetal, but not of adult, thymocytes resulted in the appearance of distinct clusters of DETC as judged by their dendritic morphology and uniform expression of CD3/TCR V gamma 3 receptors. The presence of CD3+/TCR V gamma 3+ cells in the fetal, but not in the adult, thymocyte population(s) together with the failure to detect DETC after transfer of Thy-1+/CD3- fetal thymocytes strongly suggest that CD3+/TCR V gamma 3+ thymocytes are the DETC precursors. Kinetic studies of the DETC population from 2 to 12 wk after cell transfer revealed a substantial increase in the cell density within the DETC clusters that was not accompanied by an increase in the number of clusters. Thus, it appears that newly arriving DETC undergo proliferative activity in situ. Collectively, our results show that, under the experimental conditions chosen, CD3+/TCR V gamma 3+ fetal thymocytes are actual DETC precursors. Although it is not clear whether these experimental conditions are representative of the in vivo situation, they may serve as a useful model for studying the mechanisms underlying the homing properties of different lymphocyte subsets.\r"

Therefore we studied whether ALD would affect purified T cells directly. We found that ALD enhanced the proliferation and IL-2 production of T cells in the absence of monocytes. This effect did not depend on arachidonic acid metabolism as no lipoxygenase products and only nonsuppressive levels of cyclooxygenase products were detected in T cell cultures. Several possible mechanisms of the ALD effect were ruled out including 1) enhanced mitogen binding, 2) induction of activation markers (IL-2R, transferrin receptor, HLA-DR) on the cell surface, 3) down-regulation of suppressor cells. ALD caused a rise in [Ca2+]i which appeared to reflect an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu and was more pronounced in CD4+ cells. The rise in intracellular levels of Ca2+, that is considered a necessary second messenger for T cell activation, may prime these cells for an enhanced response to mitogens. In addition, ALD increased T cell membrane fluidity but only at higher concentrations than those found to enhance proliferation. The pharmacologic effect of ALD on T cells presents a possible new immunoenhancing potential of these drugs and may have therapeutic use in immunosuppressed individuals.\r"

  ".W": "The combined expression of the M167 mu/kappa anstiphosphocholine (PC) transgenes with the x-linked immunodeficiency gene, xid, results in an almost total failure to develop B cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs of such mice. Although there is no significant difference between the normal transgene positive (TG+) female offspring and the immunodeficient TG+ xid males with respect to the number of B220+ pre-B cells and IgM+B220+B cells that develop in their bone marrow, the hemizygous xid males have 85% fewer B cells in their spleens than the phenotypically normal heterozygous F1 females. In xid M167-mu-transgenic mice, PC-specific B cells also fail to develop in the spleen; however, numerous B cells bearing the mua+VH1(+)-transgene product associated with endogenous kappa L chains that do not give rise PC-specific antibodies are present. In the phenotypically normal TG+ (B6.CBA/N x mu 243-4)F1 female mice, PC-specific B cells represent almost 10% of the total B cell population, and these B cells express an M167-Id that has been produced by association of the VH1 transgene product with an endogenous V kappa 24L chain. B cells expressing the normally dominant T15-Id are not detectable in the spleens of these M167 mu-transgenic mice. Furthermore, M167-Id+ B cells are present at a fivefold lower level in the bone marrow of mu-TG+ normal mice than in their spleens. These data suggest that the PC-specific B cells that develop in TG+ xid mice are either clonally deleted via some \"IgR-directed\" mechanism or they fail to receive the appropriate signals to exit the bone marrow or to enter the peripheral lymphoid tissues. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that TNP-specific B cells develop normally and do not undergo clonal deletion in xid mice carrying the Sp6 mu/kappa anti-TNP transgenes.\r"

  ".W": "Receptor binding of HIV to the CD4 molecule is required for efficient infection of T cells, but the post-binding steps that result in penetration of HIV are not well understood. CD4 is induced to internalize upon T cell activation, and mAb to CD4 modify signal transduction and T cell activation as does HIV in some systems. It is not known whether HIV binding triggers CD4 endocytosis or whether signal transduction events are required for penetration. Selected inhibitors of signal transduction were evaluated for their effects on penetration using two assays that are dependent on penetration. After short term exposure to inhibitor and HIV, cells were analyzed for reverse-transcribed HIV DNA (DNA amplification assay), or productive infection is monitored (infectivity assay). Viral penetration was tested in the presence of H7 (protein kinase C inhibition), EGTA (extracellular Ca2+ chelation), cyclosporine A (inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation), or pertussis toxin (inhibition of G protein function). All agents were used at concentrations that were inhibitory for their respective signal transduction pathways. None of the inhibitors affected viral penetration. We tracked the CD4 molecule with fluorescent probes that do not interfere with HIV binding in a system where CD4 T cells were saturated with HIV and the penetration event was relatively synchronized. Under conditions where detection of CD4 was more sensitive than the detection of HIV, HIV internalization was readily detected but CD4 internalization was not.\r"

  ".W": "The present study investigates the regulatory effects of glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate on T cell proliferation induced by thymic stromal cell monolayer or its derived T cell growth factor (TCGF). A thymic stromal cell clone (MRL104.8a) supported the growth of Ag-specific, IL-2-dependent Th cell clone (9-16) in the absence of Ag and IL-2 by producing a unique TCGF designated as thymic stroma-derived T cell growth factor (TSTGF). The addition of heparin to cultures in which the growth of 9-16 Th cells was otherwise stimulated by the MRL104.8a monolayer or a semipurified sample of the TSTGF resulted in heparin dose-dependent inhibition of 9-16 Th proliferation. The dose of heparin required for inducing 50% reduction of TSTGF-induced proliferation of Th at a given cell number was found to be proportional to the magnitude of the TSTGF added to cultures, suggesting that heparin exerted its inhibitory effect by binding to the TSTGF rather than by acting on Th cells. A similar growth-inhibiting effect of heparin was observed in IL-7-dependent proliferation of pre-B cell line or Th, but not in IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation or IL-3-dependent myeloid cell proliferation. A strong affinity of TSTGF and IL-7 for heparin was confirmed by the fact that both TSTGF and IL-7 adhered to columns of heparin-agarose and were eluted by salt. When various glycosaminoglycans were tested for the heparin-like Th growth-regulatory capacity, heparan sulfate exhibited Th growth-inhibiting ability comparable to that observed for heparin. These results indicate that the activity of thymic and/or bone marrow stroma-derived lymphocyte growth factor (TSTGF/IL-7) but not of Th-producing TCGF (IL-2) is negatively regulated by heparin or heparan sulfate, which would represent major glycosaminoglycans in the extra-cellular matrix of stromal cells.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects that the combination of IL-1 alpha and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) had on PGE2 production in a murine clonal osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 and primary rat calvarial osteoblast-like cells. In serum-supplemented medium, IL-1 alpha was a potent stimulator of PGE2 production in MC3T3-E1 cells (50-fold increase with 0.1 ng/ml). TGF-beta (10 ng/ml) had only a small effect alone and no additional effect on IL-1 alpha-induced responses. In serum-deprived MC3T3-E1 cells, PGE2 responses to IL-1 alpha were either absent or markedly reduced. TGF-beta alone had small effects. However, simultaneous addition of TGF-beta with IL-1 alpha to MC3T3-E1 cells partially restored the ability of IL-1 alpha to generate a PGE2 response (10-fold increase in PGE2 with 0.1 ng/ml of both IL-1 alpha and TGF-beta). As with MC3T3-E1 cells, serum-deprived primary fetal rat calvarial osteoblastic cells also did not respond to IL-1 alpha, unless TGF-beta was present in the medium (sixfold increase in PGE2 with 0.1 ng/ml IL-1 alpha and 10 ng/ml TGF-beta). The synergistic effect of TGF-beta and IL-1 alpha was specific for PGE2 responses, because these factors did not synergistically affect cell proliferation, collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis, or alkaline phosphatase activity. The observed synergy was not associated with changes in the steady state cyclooxygenase (PGH synthase) mRNA levels. However, it did correlate with increased release of [3H]arachidonic acid from prelabeled serum-depleted MC3T3-E1 cells. Hence, the synergistic interactions of IL-1 alpha and TGF-beta on PGE2 appear to occur through an increase in the release of arachidonic acid substrate from phospholipid pools. These effects may be important for both normal bone turnover and the responses of bone to inflammatory and immune stimuli.\r"

In the recipient C57BL/10 Sn Slc (B10) mice given 1 x 10(8) B10.BR Sg Sn Slc (B10.BR) spleen cells (SC) on day -2 followed by 200 mg/kg CP on day 0, the number of leukocytes and neutrophils in the periphery declined to their minimum levels on day 4. When rhG-CSF in a dose of 200 micrograms/kg was given daily for 5 days to the B10 mice, which had been treated with B10.BR SC and CP, starting one day after the administration of CP, the leukocyte and neutrophil counts declined to the same levels as those in the B10 mice treated with B10.BR SC and CP alone on day 2. On day 4, however, the counts recovered to their normal levels. The nucleated cell count of the spleen in the B10 mice given B10.BR SC and CP followed by rhG-CSF decreased less and recovered faster than that in the B10 mice given B10.BR SC and CP. The case was found to be the same in bone marrow, and the difference did not reach statistical significance. When the recipient mice were inoculated i.p. with 4 x 10(4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (GNB-139) on day 4, the survival of the B10 mice treated with B10.BR SC and CP was markedly improved by rhG-CSF administration. The administration of rhG-CSF did not affect either the prolongation or the specificity of skin allograft survival, as shown in an H-2 mis-matched combination of B10.BR----B10 and in an H-2 identical combination of AKR/J Sea(AKR)----C3H/HeN Crj (C3H). The tolerant state, which was demonstrated by various immune responses, such as CTL, delayed footpad reaction, and antibody, was also not affected by rhG-CSF. Furthermore, the basic mechanisms for inducing a long-lasting skin allograft tolerance in this system--namely, the specific destruction of Ag-stimulated and then proliferating mature T cells in the periphery, the establishment of mixed chimerism, and the intrathymic clonal deletion of immature T cells--were preserved even when rhG-CSF was given to C3H mice previously made tolerant of AKR.\r"

  ".W": "Modulation of granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) receptors on murine peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) by various cytokines was investigated. At 4 degrees C, 125I-G-CSF receptor binding on PEM reached a plateau after 6 h and was specifically competed by unlabeled human rG-CSF but not by other cytokines, including human rG-CSF-1, murine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage CSF, murine rIFN-gamma, human rIL-1 beta, and murine rTNF-alpha. 125I-G-CSF bound to PEM has a half-life of 30 min at 37 degrees C. Preincubation of PEM with murine rTNF, murine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage CSF, CSF-1, or G-CSF for 30 min at 37 degrees C resulted in partial reduction of 125I-G-CSF binding capacity, whereas IL-1 or IFN-gamma did not inhibit G-CSF binding. Further studies indicated that reduction of G-CSF binding caused by TNF was a dose- and time-dependent process and did not require FCS. The reduction was transient, and receptor binding was recovered by incubation at 37 degrees C for 8 h. The recovery of G-CSF binding was inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide. In addition, G-CSF binding studies suggested that the TNF-induced decrease in G-CSF binding to PEM was probably due to a reduction in receptor number rather than receptor affinity. Modulation of G-CSFR by TNF was also observed on nonelicited macrophages from various strains of mice. Our results demonstrate a physiologic response of G-CSFR on macrophages that is modulated by TNF. This phenomenon may play an important, as yet unknown, role in the macrophage inflammatory response.\r"

We have used these mAb to evaluate the role of IgG subclass-specific C region determinants in modulating the interaction between antibody and the bacterial surface. We report, for the first time, that V region-identical murine IgG of different subclasses exhibit substantial differences in binding to specific Ag; IgG3 mAb binds more strongly to streptococci than the IgG1 and IgG2b mAb or IgG3-derived F(ab')2 fragments. Furthermore, the IgG3 mAB binds cooperatively to the bacteria, whereas the IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3-derived F(ab')2 fragments do not exhibit significant cooperativity, which suggests that differences in Fc region structure can affect antibody binding to multivalent Ag by modulating the potential for cooperative binding. These results suggest a plausible mechanism by which murine IgG3 could be more effective, than other antibodies bearing identical V domains, but of different gamma-subclass, in mediating bacterial immunity.\r"

LPG stimulated the rapid expression of both c-fos and TNF genes within 30 min after exposure, suggesting that the interaction of LPG with its receptor stimulated a specific signal transduction pathway. Macrophages pretreated with LPG for 3 h became unresponsive to subsequent stimulation with LPS and the activators of protein kinase C, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol, and calcium ionophore A23187. Moreover, LPG induced a rapid down-modulation of TNF receptors. In contrast, the ability of macrophages to express the c-fos gene in response to the cAMP analogue, dibutyryl cAMP, was not impaired by LPG. Fragmentation of LPG revealed that the inhibitory activity of LPG required both the repeating phosphorylated disaccharides and the phosphosaccharide core. Collectively, these data demonstrate that LPG selectively impaired signal transduction in macrophages and suggest a role for this molecule in the survival of the parasite within the macrophage.\r"

In the PEC on day 7 after infection, approximately 26% of the CD3+ cells were CD4-CD8-, most of which expressed TCR gamma/delta on their surface. However, the PEC on day 28 contained an increased number of alpha/beta T cells that were CD4+8- or CD4-8+ and the proportion of gamma/delta T cells in the PEC reciprocally decreased to 18% of the CD3+ cells. The kinetics of gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cells in the LN during BCG infection showed in much the same pattern as that seen in the PEC. When purified CD4-CD8- cells in the LN on day 7 after BCG infection were cultured with sonicated BCG lysate, PPD derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis or recombinant 65 kDa heat shock protein derived from Mycobacterium bovis, the gamma/delta T cells on this stage significantly proliferated and secreted IL-2 in response to sonicated BCG lysate and PPD but not to 65 kDa heat shock protein. V gene segment usage analysis with PCR method revealed that purified protein derivative-reactive gamma/delta T cells preferentially used V gamma 1/2/V delta 6, whereas gamma/delta T cells polyclonally expanded in response to the BCG lysate. These results suggest that gamma/delta T cells specific for mycobacterial antigens preceding alpha/beta T cells in appearance during infection may serve as a first line of defense against mycobacterial infection.\r"

  ".U": "91201830\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies with models of cutaneous leishmaniasis have provoked much interest in the role of CD4+ T cell subsets in determining the outcome of infectious disease. In Leishmania major infections, cure vs progressive disease correlates with the expansion of Th1-like or Th2-like CD4+ populations, respectively. We have investigated whether similar responses are associated with the differential patterns of infection seen in models of visceral leishmaniasis, caused by L. donovani. Splenic lymphocytes from infected Lsh congenic C57BL/10 (Lshs;H-2b) and B10.L-Lshr (Lshr;H-2b) mice and MHC congenic non-curing B10.D2/n (Lshs;H-2d) mice were examined for the production of cytokines representative of these CD4+ populations (IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-gamma). In all three strains examined, there was no evidence for the production of Th2-restricted cytokines. In addition, levels of serum IgE were depressed during the early phase of infection, indicative of in vivo IFN-gamma production. In the non-curing B10.D2/n strain, late phase of infection was associated with the decreased ability to produce cytokines in response to Ag and not with the production of IL-4 or IL-5 in response to Ag or mitogen. Serum IgE levels were also not raised above levels seen in uninfected controls. C57BL/10 mice were vaccinated with SDS-PAGE fractionated amastigote Ag bound to nitrocellulose and cytokine levels determined at various times after infection. The protocol used for vaccination was able to induce significant modulation of the course of infection in this strain and it was clear that IFN-gamma production in vitro provided an excellent correlate of rate of cure. Occasional individuals produced low levels of IL-5 in culture in response to parasite Ag, but this did not correlate with disease progression. Together, these data suggest that over-expansion of Th2-type cells and production of their specific cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) is not a contributing factor to the variable long term course of L. donovani infection in these strains of mice.\r"

We therefore analyzed in a mouse model of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi the response of T lymphocytes taken from peripheral blood and compared it with the spleen during and after a primary erythrocytic infection. Using limiting dilution conditions, no malaria-specific T cell responses could be measured in the peripheral blood for up to 21 days after infection with P. chabaudi, whereas T cells responding to malaria Ag were readily detected in the spleen. This was true for T cells providing help and for those producing IFN-gamma. After clearance of the parasitemias to subpatent levels (75 days), qualitatively similar T cell responses were found in both compartments of the immune system, i.e., the Th cell response predominated over the inflammatory response. These data suggest that during an active infection with Plasmodium, T cell responses in peripheral blood are not necessarily indicators of the immune status.\r"

Optimal phagocytosis of both species by Mo required the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and opsonization through both the classic and alternative complement pathways. Serum-opsonized Candida were ingested equally by Mo and MDM; unopsonized Candida were phagocytosed only by macrophages, and uptake began slowly. This opsonin-independent phagocytosis required Ca2+ and could be blocked by yeast mannan or mannose-BSA conjugate, suggesting a role for the mannose receptor. Opsonized Candida elicited a vigorous increase in the concentration of [Ca2+]i in Mo and MDM, but no Ca2+ transient was detected in MDM stimulated with unopsonized Candida. Pretreatment of MDM with ionomycin to increase [Ca2+]i had no effect on phagocytosis of unopsonized Candida. Addition of 5 mM EGTA completely inhibited changes in [Ca2+]i in Mo and MDM, suggesting that the Ca2+ transient induced by opsonized Candida is due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Differences in pathogenicity between the two Candida species could not be explained by differences in any aspect of phagocytosis. Uptake mediated by the macrophage mannose receptor could play a role in clearance of Candida under opsonin-poor conditions.\r"

A seventh human lambda C region gene segment, C lambda 7, was found 2.7 kb downstream of C lambda 6 in this gene complex. A J lambda gene segment, J lambda 7, was found 1.2 kb upstream of C lambda 7 and contains potentially functional nonamer and heptamer recombination sites, an RNA splice site and J coding region. C lambda 7 maintains an open reading frame and encodes a new lambda isotype. C lambda 7 encodes Kern+ and Oz- determinants, but does not encode any of the Kern+Oz- myeloma proteins published to date. Nevertheless, we present evidence that JC lambda 7 is transcribed in normal lymphocytes and is functional. In contrast, we present new data that the C lambda 6 gene segment, reported by others to encode the Kern+Oz- protein, is non-functional due to a 4-bp insertion in our cosmid clone. The 4-bp insertion was characterized further in 32 genomic DNA samples by producing a distinctive restriction fragment length and verified by the DNA sequences of the polymerase chain reaction products of two different cell lines. We discuss the possibility that the Kern+Oz- myeloma proteins do not define an isotype and are not encoded by JC lambda 7 nor other non-allelic genes, and we discuss the level of expression of JC lamba 7 as compared to that of JC lambda 2 and JC lambda 3.\r"

  ".W": "A rearrangement test gene, pHRD, containing the mouse IgH enhancer and the metallothionein promoter, has previously been shown to rearrange efficiently after transfection into a pre-B cell line. Experiments are now reported that assess the requirements of the DNA substrate as well as of the transfected cells for efficient rearrangement. It was found that deletion of the metallothionein promoter or substitution of the IgH enhancer by the kappa enhancer did not affect rearrangement. However, deletion of the Ig enhancer reduced the efficiency. Transfection of pHRD into stable hybrids of pre-B cells and myeloma cells resulted in a high frequency of rearrangement only if certain myeloma chromosomes were lost. Furthermore, pHRD introduced into rearrangement incompetent myeloma cells upon subsequent cell fusion with pre-B cells was rearranged only very rarely and then apparently only immediately after cell fusion. Stable pre-B cell x myeloma hybrids that retained the critical myeloma chromosomes were found to have lost VDJ recombinase activity and transcripts of the RAG-1, RAG-2 and TdT genes. It is concluded that transcription, i.e., the copying of the DNA by polymerase, is probably not required for rearrangement, but that the rearrangement substrate must be in an \"open\" chromatin state, such as may be provided by transcriptional factors. Furthermore, the absence of rearrangement in myeloma cells is apparently due to the continued action of an inhibitor of rearrangement.\r"

Transgenic B cells have decreased surface levels of both IgM and IgD. The circulating IgM in these mice is 3- to 10-fold enriched in lambda L chains, compared with that in non-transgenic mice. Analysis of IgM-producing hybridomas, from transgenic mice that express the transgene at high levels, demonstrates that this higher lambda frequency is observed in transgene-nonexpressing as well as transgene-expressing hybridomas. A partial loss of L chain isotype exclusion is also noted in these hybridomas, and a significant proportion of primary B cells expressing both kappa and lambda L chains on their surface can be demonstrated. These findings suggest an ability of the transgenic Ig H chain to affect events in B cell ontogeny beyond the H chain locus. Our results support a quantitative model of exclusion for both the H chain alleles and the L chain isotypes.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve syngeneic anti-idiotopic mAb (anti-idiotypic/idiotopic antibodies Ab2)) were prepared from CBH/Cbi rats immunized with one of three monoclonal anti-HSN antibodies (Ab1) (11/160, ALN/11/53, or ALN/16/53) specific for the HSN tumor. The sera of the rats used for hybridoma production and all of the monoclonal Ab2 specifically inhibited the binding to HSN of the immunizing Ab1 only. It is concluded that, in this completely syngeneic system, only the private idiotopes associated with the antibody-combining site were immunogenic. Analyses using Western blotting showed that the Ab2 bound to intact Ab1 and to isolated H chains where the intra-strand disulfide bonds remained intact. The Ab2 did not bind to L chains or to fully reduced H chains of the Ab1. It is concluded that the idiotopes expressed on the H chain were conformational. When a panel of 13 monoclonal Ab1 (including the three used for immunization) were tested for reactivity with the Ab2, three reacted specifically with their respective Ab2 and 8 gave no binding suggesting that each Ab1 had a distinct idiotypic specificity despite the fact that all the Ab1 competed with each other for binding to Ag. However, the two remaining Ab1 (ALN/9/94 and ALN/12/17) generated from different tumor-bearing rats, were found to possess the same idiotypic specificity as 11/160. A detailed analysis using seven Ab2 raised against 11/160 showed that while the idiotype of ALN/9/94 and 11/160 were very similar, that of ALN/12/17 showed some clear differences. These three Ab1 have been shown previously to bind a sequential epitope on the HSN Ag in Western blots and it is postulated that the common idiotype of these Ab1 reflects their recognition of a sequential epitope. This may also account for the relatively frequent occurrence in tumor bearer sera of antibodies with this Id.\r"

  ".W": "The T cell Ag (Ti-CD3) receptor complex has been proposed to regulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) through a cholera toxin (CTX)-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein. In this study, we have used CTX and staurosporine as pharmacologic probes to further define the linkage between the Ti-CD3 receptor and PLC activity in the human T cell line, Jurkat. CTX pretreatment inhibited Ti-CD3 receptor-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis and, concomitantly, protein tyrosine kinase activation in intact cells. Studies with electrically permeabilized Jurkat cells revealed that guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio) triphosphate stimulated an increase in PLC activity, that unlike the response to Ti-CD3 receptor ligation, was not affected by cellular pretreatment with CTX. In contrast, the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, orthovanadate and molybdate anions, stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in permeabilized cells through a CTX-sensitive mechanism of PLC activation. Additional studies with a known PTK inhibitor, staurosporine, supported the results obtained with CTX. Staurosporine pretreatment inhibited the phosphoinositide hydrolysis induced by anti-CD3 antibodies or phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, but failed to alter the G protein-dependent PLC activation response to guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio) triphosphate. The results of this study indicate that PLC activity(s) in Jurkat cells are regulated by both G protein- and PTK-dependent coupling mechanisms. However, the differential inhibitory effects of CTX and staurosporine on these PLC activation pathways strongly suggest that a protein tyrosine kinase activation event, rather than a G protein, mediates the functional linkage between the Ti-CD3 receptor and PLC activity in Jurkat cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that a T cell hybridoma, A1.1, constitutively produces an Ag-specific regulatory factor with specificity for poly-18, a synthetic polypeptide. This cell also responds to poly-18 plus I-Ad by producing lymphokines. The antigenic specificity of the factor and the T cell appeared to be the same. This suggested the possibility that some part of the TCR, responsible for antigenic specificity of the cell, also imparts specificity to the A1.1-derived factor. This was supported by the observation that the factor was bound and eluted from a monospecific anti-TCR antiserum. Further, we demonstrated that antisense oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the TCR V alpha of A1.1 (but not TCR V beta) block production of the Ag-specific factor. Herein, we report recent findings that strengthen the proposed relationship between the TCR and the A1.1-derived factor. The factor was bound and eluted from a monoclonal anti-TCR C alpha antibody, but not from anti-TCR beta, anti-V beta 6, nor anti-CD3 epsilon. The anti-TCR C alpha antibody bound a Mr 46-kDa protein from A1.1 supernatants, which is the same apparent size at which activity could be eluted from an SDS-PAGE gel separation of concentrated factor. Antigenic fine-specificity analysis revealed that two amino acids in poly-18 are critical for the recognition of the antigen by the Ag-specific factor. These two amino acids appear to be those recognized by the TCR. The factor that was bound and eluted from the monoclonal anti-TCR C alpha showed this fine-specificity as well. This, combined with our earlier studies, supports the view that the A1.1-derived factor is encoded, at least in part, by TCR-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Cholera toxin (CT) is a strong systemic and mucosal adjuvant that greatly enhances IgG and IgA immune responses. We investigated whether CT potentiates Ag presentation by macrophages as a possible mechanism underlying its adjuvant function. This was tested by preculturing APC in CT and analyzing the effect of CT treatment on the capacity to trigger 1) an allogeneic proliferative response of normal mesenteric lymph node T cells (H-2b) to the macrophage cell line P388D1 (H-2d) or 2) an Ag-specific proliferative response of D10.G4.1 clonal T cells in co-culture with normal macrophages and Ag. Pretreatment of APC, normal peritoneal macrophages or the P388D1 cells, with CT strongly enhanced Ag- and allogen-specific T cell proliferation. Also P388D1 APC treated with CT and then formalin-fixed demonstrated enhanced ability to stimulate T cell proliferation as compared to cells not exposed to CT, suggesting that the effect of CT on APC might be to enhance expression of a cell-associated factor. Flow microfluorimetry analysis of P388D1 cells cultured in CT-containing medium failed to detect an increase in class II MHC-Ag expression as compared to that found on cells not cultured in CT. In contrast, both soluble and cell-associated IL-1 formation was increased several-fold by CT, but with different CT dose requirements. A total of 10 to 100 times more CT were required for elevating the soluble IL-1 as compared to the cell associated IL-1, which was increased by as little as 1 ng/ml of CT. The soluble and cell-associated IL-1 activity induced by CT was abrogated by a polyclonal antiserum to IL-1-alpha. Similarly, the potentiating effect of CT on the ability of P388D1 APC to trigger alloreactive T cell proliferation was also blocked completely by the addition of the anti-IL-1-alpha antibody to the test system. This is the first study to demonstrate that CT potentiates Ag presentation. The mechanism for this effect probably involves induction of IL-1 production and in particular of a cell-associated form of IL-1 (IL-1-alpha). Potentiation of APC function might be important for the adjuvant action of CT on the immune response in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91201856\r", 
  ".W": "Despite the tremendous plasticity of the TCR repertoire, T cells recognize a limited number of antigenic sites (frequently a single site, or immunodominant epitope) on a complex protein Ag. Current models suggest that the immunodominant epitope of a complex protein is the processed peptide that binds to the MHC molecule with the highest affinity. Conversely, the inability of the T cell population to recognize a specific epitope, termed a \"hole\" in the repertoire, can prevent the immunodominance of a peptide despite efficient processing and MHC binding of the peptide. The role of specific TCR alpha- or beta-chains in determining MHC restriction and recognizing specific epitopes is complex and incompletely understood. To evaluate the contribution of each TCR chain to the functional diversity of the T cell repertoire, we investigated in vivo the T cell response to phage lambda-repressor protein in transgenic mice expressing a single rearranged beta-chain gene (C57L beta mice) in association with the complete germline alpha-chain repertoire. Our results demonstrate that expression of the TCR beta-chain transgene alters the immunodominant epitope recognized by T cells. However, after immunization with the appropriate peptide the transgenic mice can also respond to the nonimmunodominant epitope; thus, the expression of the TCR beta-chain transgene does not create a hole in the repertoire. These data indicate that the primary site, or immunodominant epitope, of an Ag recognized by T cells can be altered by the preimmune TCR repertoire independent of antigen processing and MHC affinity.\r"

  ".U": "91201857\r", 
  ".W": "Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) is a potent mitogen for purified human B cells. By using Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, we demonstrated that the mitogenic effect of SAC is associated with rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 45, 68, 75, 97, and 145 kDa. This tyrosine phosphorylation was detected within 30 s of the addition of SAC; it reached a maximum within 10 min, after which it declined gradually. In contrast to SAC, most soluble anti-IgM antibodies do not induce proliferation of isolated human B cells. As indicated by Western blotting, soluble anti-IgM antibodies induced a similar pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation, with the exception of the 68-kDa protein, which was the most heavily phosphorylated protein in SAC-treated cells. A similar but less intense 68-kDa band was also induced by mitogenic anti-IgM bound to beads. This suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation, especially of p68, may play an important role in B cell mitogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrphostins) on SAC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, oncogene expression, and B cell proliferation. The concentration dependencies of inhibition of these processes suggested that they were linked. Nonspecific toxic effects of the tyrphostins were ruled out by the demonstration that the tyrphostins did not alter cell viability and did not inhibit B cell proliferation induced by phorbol esters, which do not induce tyrosine phosphorylation. For maximal inhibition of SAC-induced cell proliferation, the tyrophostins needed to be added before or shortly after addition of SAC. Taken together, these data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is an obligatory early signal in B cell proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "91201869\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the expression of inducible inflammatory genes in murine macrophages from different tissues and at different stages of inflammatory activity. Although i.v. administration of IFN-gamma (10,000 U/mouse) strongly induced expression of IP-10 mRNA in the adherent cell population of the spleen, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were essentially unresponsive at the same dose. In contrast, D3 mRNA was expressed in both cell populations. This differential sensitivity of IP-10 mRNA expression was not restricted to stimulation by IFN-gamma as it was also seen when LPS (25 micrograms/mouse) was administered i.v. Expression of JE and KC mRNA, which encode cytokines related to IP-10, were also differentially expressed in elicited peritoneal macrophages from mice injected with LPS. Differential sensitivity was at least partially related to the state of macrophage activation because IP-10 mRNA was highly inducible in resident but not thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. The eliciting agent was also an important determinant because proteose-peptone-elicited peritoneal macrophages were nearly as sensitive as splenic macrophages with respect to expression of IP-10 mRNA. IFN-gamma treatment induced IP-10 and D3 mRNA rapidly and transiently with the same time course in the spleen. IP-10 mRNA was not induced by IFN-gamma in TG-elicited macrophages regardless of the time after treatment. This differential expression of IP-10 was a consequence of different concentration requirements for IFN-gamma in the two cell types; thioglycollate-elicited macrophages required five- to 10-fold more IFN-gamma than did resident cells to achieve comparable IP-10 mRNA levels whether the agent was provided in vitro or in vivo. Thus variable sensitivity for induction of IP-10 mRNA was a characteristic of the macrophage itself and was not mediated by other cellular or molecular elements present in the inflammatory peritoneal cavity. The reduced sensitivity to IFN-gamma or LPS for expression of IP-10, JE, and KC mRNA as compared with TNF-alpha or D3 mRNA suggests that this distinct pattern of regulation may be restricted to members of these two related cytokine gene families that exhibit cell-type specific chemoattractant activity.\r"

These results suggested that these cytokines may be growth factors for pre-T cells. However, we recently observed that among adult CD4-CD8- thymocytes, only the CD3+ subset proliferates in response to IL-7, whereas IL-4 + PMA induces proliferative responses in both CD3- and CD3+ subsets. Thus, we concluded that IL-7 used alone is not a potent growth stimulus for adult thymic CD3-CD4-CD8- triple negative (TN) T cell precursors. Interestingly, the viability of adult TN thymocytes in culture was improved by IL-7 for up to 1 wk, in spite of the inability of IL-7 to induce significant [3H]TdR incorporation in these cells. After culture in IL-7 for 4 days, the viable cells remained CD4-CD8-, but 25 to 35% expressed CD3 whereas the rest remained CD3-. In contrast, most of the cells cultured with IL-4 + PMA for 4 days remained TN. To investigate whether adult TN thymocytes that survive in vitro in the presence of IL-4 + PMA or IL-7 retain T cell progenitor potential, we tested whether they could reconstitute lymphoid cell-depleted (2-deoxyguanosine-treated) fetal thymus organ cultures. Our results demonstrate that TN cells cultured in IL-7 retain T cell progenitor potential.\r"

  ".U": "91201875\r", 
  ".W": "Previously we have reported the purification and characterization of a novel cytokine from an EBV-transformed B cell line, RPMI 8866. This factor, termed natural killer cell stimulatory factor (NKSF), possessed pleiotropic activities including the induction of IFN-gamma from PBL, enhancement of cytotoxicity by NK cells, and stimulation of the proliferation of PBL. Purified NKSF was found to be a disulfide-linked heterodimeric protein composed of 35-kDa and 40-kDa subunits (p35 and p40). We now report the molecular cloning of cDNA for both subunits of NKSF from RPMI 8866 cellular RNA. The cDNA sequences indicate that both genes are novel, and Southern blot analysis confirmed that both cDNA are of human genomic origin. [35S]Methionine labeling indicated that cos-1 cells transfected with either p35 or p40 cDNA produced unique protein species of appropriate size. Methionine labeling of cos-1 cells cotransfected with p35 plus p40 cDNA yielded a broad band migrating between 70 and 90 kDa on a nonreducing gel. Reduction of this high molecular weight material yielded bands correlating with p35 and p40 gene products. Only culture supernatant from cotransfected cos-1 cells had a high level of NKSF biologic activity. That the high molecular weight material was responsible for this activity was indicated by the observation that biologic activity in the culture supernatant migrated at 70 to 90 kDa in a nonreducing gel. Furthermore, anti-p40 serum was able to block the biologic activities of both recombinant and natural NKSF, which indicates that it is a component of the active protein. In contrast, no activity could be detected in the supernatants of cos-1 cells transfected with p40 or p35 cDNA alone. The spectrum of biologic activity produced by cotransfected cos-1 cells was the same as NKSF purified to homogeneity from the RPMI 8866 cell line. A synergistic augmentation of some of these responses was found by the addition of IL-2 or the co-stimulators PHA or phorbol diester. The synergistic stimulation by NKSF plus IL-2 of T and NK function supports the possibility that these cytokines might prove useful in cancer therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we have analyzed the role of the alpha 3 domain of class I molecules in T cell recognition. Using the laboratory engineered molecules LLQQ (alpha 1/alpha 2 from Ld, alpha 3, and phosphatidyl inositol (PI) linked C terminus from Q7) and LLQL (alpha 1/alpha 2 from Ld, alpha 3 from Q7, transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains from Ld) we show that these molecules are not recognized by primary Ld-specific CTL. The cell membrane expression of both Ld and LLQL are upregulated by co-culture with an exogenously supplied murine cytomegalovirus-derived peptide indicating that the Q7 alpha 3 domain does not interfere with binding of Ag to alpha 1/alpha 2. However, only peptide pulsed Ld but not LLQL target cells are recognized by Ld-restricted-peptide specific CTL. In contrast to the above results, LLQL and LLQQ molecules can be recognized by bulk alloreactive anti-Ld CTL and 2/3 of CTL clones derived from in vivo primed mice. The fact that these secondary CTL recognize LLQQ indicates that a PI linkage is permissive for presentation of class I epitopes to alloreactive CTL. These secondary CTL are resistant to blocking at the effector stage by mAb against CD8 and express relatively low levels of membrane CD8 molecules compared to CTL from unprimed mice. Further, culture of unprimed CTL precursors in the presence of CD8 mAb also allows for the generation of CD8-independent CTL that recognize LLQL. Taken together, these data indicate that the alpha 3 domain of Q7 (Qa-2) prevents CD8-dependent CTL from recognizing Ld, regardless of whether the class I molecule is attached to the cell surface by a PI moiety or as a membrane spanning protein domain. We hypothesize that this defect in recognition is most likely due to an inability of CD8 to interact efficiently with the Q7 alpha 3 domain and could account for why Q7 molecules do not serve as restricting elements for virus and minor H-Ag-specific CTL.\r"

  ".W": "Human lambda L chains of a major V lambda subgroup, V lambda III, have been differentiated serologically and chemically into three V lambda III sub-subgroups designated V lambda IIIa, V lambda IIIb, and V lambda IIIc. Antisera prepared against lambda III Bence Jones proteins were obtained that recognized distinctive V lambda III-related epitopes expressed by monoclonal lambda III L chains. After appropriate absorption, these reagents were rendered specific for three distinct populations of lambda III proteins--lambda IIIa, lambda IIIb, and lambda IIIc. The antisera were used in comparative immunodiffusion analyses of 28 monoclonal lambda III L chains, 10 of which were classified as lambda IIIa, 4 as lambda IIIb, and 14 as lambda IIIc. The isotypic nature of the three lambda III sub-subgroups was demonstrated serologically through analyses of lambda-chains derived from the serum IgG molecules of normal individuals. The amino acid sequences of five serologically classified lambda III chains, which included members of the three V lambda III sub-subgroups, had been previously determined. This information, in addition to our establishment of the complete (or virtually complete) V region sequence of 15 and the partial sequence of eight other lambda IIIa, lambda IIIb, and lambda IIIc proteins, made it possible to correlate chemical data with serologic classification. Proteins within each of the three serologically-classified lambda III sub-subgroups typically possessed a high degree (approximately 83%) of intra-sub-subgroup sequence homology that included both framework and complementarity determining region residues. Furthermore, within the framework and complementarity determining regions, sub-subgroup-specific residues were identified. Taken together, these data reveal that the human V lambda III genome consists of (at least) three distinct V lambda IIIa, V lambda IIIb, and V lambda IIIc germline genes that encode for lambda IIIa, lambda IIIb, and lambda IIIc L chains, respectively.\r"

A panel of recombinant and highly purified human cytokines was screened to detect this effect on the activation of human monocytes to kill Mycobacterium avium in an in vitro model. Peripheral blood monocytes obtained from 15 healthy donors were precultured for 2 days before infection. Monocytes were infected with two strains of M. avium, one AIDS-associated and relatively avirulent strain (86m2096), and the other a non-AIDS-associated isolate that demonstrated consistent and rapid growth in cultured human monocytes (LR114F). The effects of recombinant and purified human cytokines on M. avium infection were assayed by determining CFU of M. avium in lysates of infected monocytes after 0, 4, and 7 days of culture. After infection, monocytes were cultured in medium alone or continuously in the presence of the following cytokines: IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, or macrophage-CSF. In some experiments, cultures were performed in the presence of indomethacin (IM) in addition to cytokines. Culture in the presence of rIFN-gamma was associated with a decrease in mycobacterial growth within human monocytes. The combination of 300 U/ml of IFN-gamma plus 1 micrograms/ml of IM was associated with a 10-fold decrease (p less than 0.01) in intracellular growth of the virulent strain (LR114F) compared with unstimulated cultures. No other cytokine or combination of a cytokine with IM inhibited the intracellular growth of either strain of M. avium in human monocytes. Rather, several cytokines enhanced the intracellular growth of M. avium. IL-3, IL-6, and macrophage-CSF increased the growth of one, and IL-1 alpha of both strains of M. avium tested. IL-1 alpha and IL-6 also induced M. avium growth in tissue culture medium without monocytes. These studies indicate bidirectional effects of cytokines on intracellular parasitism that may influence the outcome of M. avium infection.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages are important regulatory cells that can both stimulate and down-regulate various immune functions. During syphilitic infection, these cells phagocytize, kill, and lyse Treponema pallidum. They also modulate early T cell activation by decreasing IL-2 production through secretion of PG. This report focuses on additional complexities of macrophage regulation. Non-adherent splenic cells were stimulated with Con A to induce IFN-gamma synthesis. High levels were detected in preparations from normal rabbits and much lower levels in preparations from infected rabbits. The organisms also readily stimulated IL-1 synthesis by adherent spleen preparations from normal but not from infected rabbits. When indomethacin was added to these latter preparations, this IL-1 defect was reversed, implicating PG in this down-regulation. Spleen cells were obtained from normal rabbits and from rabbits infected testicularly for 9 to 12 days. Infection elevated basal levels of class II Ia Ag on adherent cells. In addition, macrophage Ia expression was increased during 4 days of in vitro incubation with treponemes. Non-adherent spleen cells from infected animals inhibited two different macrophage functions. First, culture filtrates obtained after 48 h of incubation contained a soluble factor that subsequently decreased LPS-induced IL-1 synthesis. Second, when macrophages were co-incubated with non-adherent cells, treponemal stimulation of macrophage Ia expression was inhibited; this inhibition was reversed by indomethacin implicating prostaglandins in this down-regulation. In further experiments an exogenous source of IFN-gamma was incubated with adherent cells from infected rabbits. This stimulated macrophage function as shown by increased IL-1 synthesis and Ia expression and decreased PGE2 secretion. Results are discussed in terms of the complexities of immunoregulation by macrophages during syphilitic infection.\r"

Included among the various cis-acting elements of transcriptional control in MHC class II genes are the class II boxes, X and Y, and sequences 5' of X in the W (Z, H, S) region of class II genes. The Ii promoter region contains homologues of these elements, designated here as X, Y', and \"W\". This study utilized transient transfection and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase analysis to investigate the role of these elements in basal and inducible Ii gene expression. Invariant chain X, Y', and \"W\" all contribute to gene expression in B lymphoblastoid cell lines, making them likely candidates to mediate coordinate control of class II and Ii genes. IFN-gamma-inducible expression of the Ii gene in a glioblastoma cell line is also regulated through X, Y', and \"W\". Thus, the Ii class II boxes and \"W\" have dual roles in basal and inducible gene transcription.\r"

The effect of these mutations on transcriptional activity was evaluated in several systems, either by transfection into cultured cells or by in vitro transcription. The data points to the now classical X and Y boxes as the most important control elements, either for constitutive expression in B lymphoma cells, or for IFN-gamma-inducible expression in macrophages. Motifs upstream of the X box also play a role, but are somewhat less critical. Overall, we find no marked difference between regulatory strategies in B lymphomas or activated macrophages.\r"

Even though C regions and unrearranged V segments have been found to lack mutations, it is not known whether the mutational mechanism can be active in unrearranged J segments and their flanking regions. By polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the 500 bp at the 5' end of the JC intron of hybridoma DNA derived from splenic B cells, we show that the frequency of mutations in unrearranged J regions of kappa and H chain genes is 0/7849 bp (upper 95% confidence interval, less than 0.00038) and 1/3209 bp (upper 95% confidence interval, less than 0.0015), respectively. The frequency (f) for the same region of rearranged kappa and H chain genes was 29/9380 bp (95% confidence, 0.0021 less than f less than 0.0044) and 16/2750 bp (95% confidence, 0.0033 less than f less than 0.0094), respectively. The significantly higher frequency of mutations in the rearranged alleles indicates that rearrangement is needed to effect full activation of the mutational mechanism. The data also show that mutations occur predominantly in the 5'-most 250 bp of the JC kappa intron. Statistical analysis of the distribution of mutations within the 5'-most 521 bp of the JC kappa intron reveals significant deviation (p = 0.000085) from a theoretically determined uniform distribution, indicating that mutations are not evenly distributed within this region.\r"

The lysis of SRBC occurs by a mechanism that does not involve nuclear degradation but presumably does involve membrane damage. Three patterns were observed: CTL and some Th2 cells lysed efficiently nucleated target cells and SRBC coated with anti-CD3 mAb. Th1 and some Th2 T cells lysed nucleated target cells but did not lyse efficiently the SRBC coated with anti-CD3 mAb. Finally, some Th2 cells failed to lyse efficiently either nucleated or SRBC targets. We also examined these clones for their expression of N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysin thiobenzyl esterase activity, and for the expression of perforin or CTLA-1 (granzyme B) mRNA. Total N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysin thiobenzyl esterase activity expressed by CTL and Th2 clones tended to be higher than that of Th1 cells. Perforin mRNA and CTLA-1 mRNA were readily detectable in CTL and some Th2 clones. Expression of perforin and CLTA-1 mRNA correlated well with the capacity of these clones to lyse SRBC coated with anti-CD3 mAb. Our results show that some but not all Th2 clones have lytic characteristics similar to those of CD8+ CTL. Two mechanisms appear to contribute to their lytic process, one mechanism of lysis involves membrane damage that correlates with the expression of perforin mRNA; a second mechanism involves the induction of DNA degradation in the target cells. In contrast, some CD4+ effector cells appear to lack the capacity to lyse efficiently via the mechanism involving membrane damage and may only have the lytic activity associated with the capacity to induce DNA degradation.\r"

We found that resting PBL were unable to mediate lysis, but were able to block tumor growth. Moreover, targeted PBL were unable to lyse bystander cells, whereas targeted PBL did block the growth of bystander tumor cells in culture and in nude mice. Supernatants from cultures of targeted PBL, or from PBL grown on anti-CD3-coated flasks, blocked the growth of tumor cells in the absence of added effector cells, and antibodies against TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma reversed the inhibition of tumor growth, but had no effect upon cytolysis mediated by targeted by PBL. Our results show that targeted human PBL mediate two different antitumor activities: lysis, which occurs rapidly and requires the direct attachment of the target cell to the cytotoxic cell, and tumor growth inhibition, which is mediated by cytokines released into the medium as a result of receptor cross-linking. The inhibition of bystander tumor growth in mice by targeted PBL suggests that factor release is sufficient to block tumor growth in vivo. Targeted factor release therefore provides a mechanism by which targeted PBL could block the growth of tumor cells in vivo that were not bound by the effector cells, but which were located in the vicinity of tumor cells that were bound.\r"

In high responders the number of oocytes was not modified by the combined treatment compared with the control cycle. However, serum estradiol level was significantly (P less than 0.005) decreased.

The inhibitory activity was most efficacious when rIFN alpha 2 was added as the CD4+ T cells were being activated, and less but still considerable when rIFN alpha 2 was added 4-96 h after CD4+ T-cell activation. rIFN alpha 2 exerted a suppressive effect on the proliferation of the CD4+ T cells, but this effect was small at concentrations that caused 90% inhibition of the replication of HIV-1. rIFN beta, rIFN gamma, and rTNF alpha had no effect on the replication of HIV-1, but rIFN beta and rTNF alpha had a costimulatory effect on CD4+ T-cell proliferation.

The in vitro sensitivity to ZDV triphosphate of the reverse transcriptase (RT) from both isolates appeared to be unchanged compared to that of the LAV-Bru HIV-1 reference strain. When isolates were grown in CEM cells (a T-lymphoblastoid tumor cell line) and their RT activity and core antigen (p24) production were determined, the level of p24 production compared to RT activity was high; in infected CEM cells treated with ZDV, RT activity was at background level while the p24 production was still significant, thus indicating a dissociation of RT activity and core antigen production.\r"

  ".U": "91202372\r", 
  ".W": "We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the effectiveness and costs of dapsone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or aerosolized pentamidine as initial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected people without prior symptoms AIDS and with CD4 counts less than 200/mm3. Each strategy increased life expectancy by about 18% compared with no prophylaxis; annual per-person costs were $440, $700, and $1,680 for dapsone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and aerosolized pentamidine, respectively. These cost differences make a strategy beginning with dapsone most cost effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,400 per life year saved compared with no prophylaxis. Aerosolized pentamidine was substantially less cost effective, but the incremental cost effectiveness ratios were highly dependent on estimates for quality of life, efficacy, toxicity, and compliance. We conclude that, based on currently available data, initial prophylaxis with either dapsone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is most cost effective. For every 100,000 people treated, starting prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or dapsone--with crossover to aerosolized pentamidine if oral therapy is not tolerated--may save between $98 million and $124 million per year.\r"

Of this select group of patients 38% had undetectable serum PSA levels (0.5 ng./ml. or less) and 38% had PSA levels that were within normal limits (4.0 ng./ml. or less). All stages and grades were represented. Undetectable PSA levels were only rarely found (3%) in patients with carcinoma of the prostate before treatment. In 24 of these 78 patients a negative biopsy of the irradiated prostate had been obtained 18 to 42 months after treatment. When the PSA level was drawn, which ranged from 7 to 16 years after treatment, an equal percentage of these biopsied patients had either an undetectable, normal or elevated level. Irradiation is able to decrease PSA to undetectable levels in some patients with prostatic carcinoma. Whether this reflects suppression of marker production alone or, more importantly, ablation of prostate cancer producing that marker remains to be determined.\r"

In 46% of mitomycin C treated animals there was urothelial atypia and in one animal, the atypia was severe enough to resemble carcinoma in situ. None of the rats treated with thiotepa showed intramural fibrous plaques or fibroblastic atypia and only 8% showed urothelial atypia. In the group treated by adriamycin instillation, 17% showed intramural fibrous plaques, but none showed urothelial atypia or fibroblastic atypia.

Cells were examined for class II antigens using an indirect immunofluorescent staining method and analysed on a fluorescence activated cell sorter. Twenty percent of RT4 cells constitutively expressed class II antigen. Both RT112 and MGH-U1 were repeatedly found to be negative for this antigen prior to treatment with interferon-gamma. Following treatment with interferon-gamma all three lines showed an increase in class II antigen expression, which was consistently dependent on both the length of incubation and concentration of interferon-gamma. A differential susceptibility was found amongst the three cell lines which may relate to the histological grade of the parent tumor.\r"

  ".W": "We describe 12 acute rejection episodes in 11 cadaver donor renal allograft recipients who required OKT3* rescue treatment for steroid-resistant acute rejection (9) or for severe vascular (antibody-mediated) rejection (3). There were 3 treatment failures with subsequent graft loss. Using 2-color flow cytometry the total T (CD3), B (DR+), activated T (CD3DR), T helper/inducer (CD4), T cytotoxic/suppressor (CD8) and activated T cytotoxic cell (CD8DR) subsets were analyzed before, in mid course (5 to 7 days) and at the end of 12 to 14 days of therapy with 5 mg. OKT3 intravenously daily. In parallel changes in the density of such T cell associated antigens were analyzed. Significant decreases in the mean levels of the CD3 (p less than 0.001), CD3DR (p less than 0.05), CD4 (p less than 0.05), CD8 (p less than 0.05) and CD8DR (p less than 0.05) subsets were observed at mid course. A significant decrease in the density of CD3 was observed (p less than 0.0001). The surface antigen density of CD3DR, CD4 and CD8 had decreased by 160% (p less than 0.002), 383% (p less than 0.001) and 260% (p less than 0.001), respectively. At the end of treatment CD3 and CD4 subset levels increased by 425% and 240% (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.005), respectively. In contrast, the CD3DR and CD8DR subset levels continued to decrease (p less than 0.05). A higher pre-treatment level of CD3DR and a less sharp decrease in CD3, CD4 and CD8 subsets were associated with a higher risk of treatment failure (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05, respectively). The mean decrease in the density of the CD3 marker in the lost grafts was significantly smaller compared to successful outcomes (p less than 0.001). The results of this preliminary study suggest that OKT3 affects T cell associated antigens other than CD3. Such may provide a sensitive prognostic index for the effectiveness of OKT3 therapy, and permit the identification of those patients who might require higher doses and/or duration of OKT3 therapy to enhance renal allograft salvage rates.\r"

This article examines the wide variation in the increases in the costs of physician services among Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia between 1975 and 1987. Cost increases during that time resulted from various combinations of increases in prices (fees) and utilization, stimulated by an increased supply of physicians. Differences among the three provinces resulted from differences in the aggressiveness of fee schedule controls and whether expenditure targets were imposed. Regardless of the degree of expenditure increases, utilization increased steadily in all three provinces and was associated most consistently with growth in the supply of physicians. This was most dramatically illustrated in Quebec, which noted the most rapid rise in physician-to-population ratio. Cost containment may ultimately require constraints on the number of new physicians in addition to controls on fees and utilization.\r"

The supply of active, posttraining patient-care physicians is projected to increase from a ratio of 144 per 100,000 population in 1986 to 176 per 100,000 in 2,000. Depending on whether expenditures per physician increase at the rate of the consumer price index, the gross national product, or the historical 1982 through 1987 expenditure trends, there will be an additional cost (in constant 1986 dollars) of $21 billion, $30 billion, or $40 billion, respectively, compared with projected physician costs under a scenario of a constant physician-to-population ratio. The disproportionate growth of costs for practice overhead will pose a particular problem for efforts to restrain inflation of expenditures per physician.\r"

A medical system compartmentalized by medical specialty should be able to save approximately 20% of present-day health care expenditures within each specialty, which then can be used to provide the necessary coverage. Some suggestions are made as to how such cost savings can be achieved. Only an effort spearheaded by physicians can achieve the outlined targets, since, otherwise, physician efforts will easily subvert such attempts. A physician initiative that could solve the crisis would reestablish physicians as leaders in determining national health care policy and should consequently improve the recently disappointing societal image of the profession.\r"

All subjects performed 1-min incremental exercise tests on a bicycle ergometer until exhaustion and endurance exercise tests at 3/4 of their maximal work rates. Arterialized venous blood samples were withdrawn at rest and during exercise tests to investigate the influence of sleep loss on blood gases. In addition, resting plasma catecholamine levels were also measured in ten subjects. The results showed that 1) resting heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels, and blood pH were decreased while minute ventilation (VI) and CO2 production (VCO2) were increased after 30 h of sleep loss (P less than 0.05), and 2) the maximal exercise performance was reduced by sleeplessness, as indicated by the decreases in the maximal heart rate, peak VI, peak VCO2, peak O2 consumption, and time to exhaustion (P less than 0.05). However, no significant changes in exercise endurance, arterialized venous pH, and PCO2 were found in exercise after sleep deprivation either. We therefore conclude that 30-h sleep loss alters cardiorespiratory function at rest and the ability to perform maximal exercise but not exercise endurance.\r"

  ".W": "Shortened forms of the group I intron from Tetrahymena catalyse sequence-specific cleavage of exogenous oligonucleotide substrates. The association between RNA enzyme (ribozyme) and substrate is mediated by pairing between an internal guide sequence on the ribozyme and a complementary sequence on the substrate. RNA substrates and cleavage products associate with a binding energy greater than that of base-pairing by approximately 4 kcal-mol-1 (at 42 degrees C), whereas DNA associates with an energy around that expected for base-pairing. It has been proposed that the difference in binding affinity is due to specific 2'-OH groups on an RNA substrate forming stabilizing tertiary interactions with the core of the ribozyme, or that the RNA.RNA helix formed upon association of an RNA substrate and the ribozyme might be more stable than an RNA.DNA helix of the same sequence. To differentiate between these two models, chimaeric oligonucleotides containing deoxynucleotide residues at successive positions along the chain were synthesized, and their equilibrium binding constants for association with the ribozyme were measured directly by a new gel electrophoresis technique. We report here that most of the extra binding energy can be accounted for by discrete RNA-ribozyme interactions, the 2'-OH group on the sugar residue three nucleotides from the cleavage site contributing the most interaction energy. Thus, in addition to the well documented binding of RNA to RNA by base-pairing, 2'-OH groups within a duplex can also mediate association between RNA molecules.\r"

By 24 hours meningococci and Hib grew to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/mL in culture supernatants, while 10(4)-10(7) cfu per organ culture were tissue associated. These studies further indicated that nasopharyngeal mucus contains components that specifically bind Hib; that both meningococci and Hib cause cytotoxicity, resulting in breakdown of tight junctions of epithelial cells, sloughing of ciliated cells, and ciliostasis; that pili are the most important components mediating initial attachment of meningococci to non-ciliated epithelial cells of the human nasopharynx; that Hib expresses both pilus and nonpilus adhesions that facilitate attachment to nonciliated cells; and that meningococci and Hib both invade the epithelial surface to reach the submucosa but do so by different routes. Meningococci and Hib have evolved successful, although divergent, mechanisms by which to infect the human nasopharynx.\r"

However, the physician's decision to use parenteral antibiotic therapy for the nursing home resident is complex and must be guided by the patient's condition, the wishes of the patient and family, the frequent shortage of professional staff, and the cost of the drug.

A live recombinant virus, vaccinia-simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac), was used to determine whether such a genetically restricted, T lymphocyte-mediated antiviral response could be generated in a primate. Vaccinia-SIVmac vaccination elicited an SIVmac Gag-specific, CD8+ CTL response in rhesus monkeys. These CTLs recognized a peptide fragment that spans residues 171 to 195 of the Gag protein. The rhesus monkey major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene product restricting this CTL response was defined. Both the vaccinated and SIVmac-infected monkeys that shared this MHC class I gene product developed CTLs with the same Gag epitope specificity. These findings support the use of recombinant virus vaccines for the prevention of HIV infections in humans.\r"

To assess the safety and efficacy of these procedures, we have reviewed our experience with percutaneous management of 12 symptomatic caliceal diverticula, 10 with stones and two infected. Nine stone-bearing diverticula were punctured directly with subsequent tract dilatation, nephroscopic stone extraction, and cavity obliteration (six with fulguration and drainage and three with drainage alone). One case was approached indirectly by puncturing a distant calix, dilating the diverticular neck, and flushing the stones into the collecting system for extraction. This cavity was not treated. Two infected diverticula were punctured directly for drainage and obliteration (one by fulguration and one by tetracycline sclerosis). Complete stone extractions were accomplished in all 10 cases. In eight with clinical follow-up ranging from 4 months to 6 years, one stone has recurred and seven patients are asymptomatic. Follow-up urograms were available in eight of 10 patients in whom cavity obliteration was attempted; in six (75%) of eight, nonvisualization of the diverticulum indicated successful obliteration. Only one major complication (urinoma requiring drainage) occurred. We conclude that percutaneous procedures are safe and effective in treating infected or stone-bearing caliceal diverticula. Direct diverticular puncture for access and diverticular fulguration for cavity obliteration is our preferred technique.\r"

In the present study, the difference in the intensity of 99mTc-pyrophosphate accumulation was assumed to be attributable to difference in the volume of infarcted myocardium, and the infarct volume was corrected by the ratio of the myocardial activity to the osseous activity to quantify the intensity of 99mTc-pyrophosphate accumulation. The correlation of measured infarct volume with peak serum creatine kinase activity was significant (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01). There was also a significant linear correlation between the corrected infarct volume and peak serum creatine kinase activity (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01). Subgroup analysis showed a high correlation between corrected volume and peak creatine kinase activity in patients with anterior infarctions (r = 0.75, p less than 0.01) but a poor correlation in patients with inferior or posterior infarctions (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01).

All patients had single-vessel disease with total or subtotal (99% with delay) occlusion of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and well-developed collaterals. The pressure-rate product, mean blood pressure, and heart rate at peak exercise did not differ before and after nitroglycerin. The size of the perfusion defect and the severity of ischemia during exercise estimated by quantitative analysis of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography were significantly less after nitroglycerin administration (extent score: 23 +/- 17 vs 7 +/- 9, p less than 0.01; severity score: 20 +/- 22 vs 3 +/- 4, p less than 0.05). The pressure-rate products at peak exercise did not differ before and after nitroglycerin, which suggested that the reduction in perfusion defect size was unlikely to be the result of decreased myocardial oxygen consumption. These results suggest that nitroglycerin improved coronary collateral function during exercise and thus prevented exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.\r"

A single-blind, randomized, cross-over study of 15 healthy males was conducted to determine: (1) if other measures of platelet activity show a morning increases and (2) if aspirin eliminates any increases in platelet activity detected. Subjects received 325 mg of enteric-coated aspirin (ECA) or placebo. During placebo therapy,platelet thromboxane A2 production (following collagen stimulation) increased significantly after the subjects got up, as did platelet aggregability to ADP, epinephrine, and collagen. ECA markedly reduced baseline platelet thromboxane A2 production and eliminated the increase after the subjects got up. It also abolished biphasic aggregation in response to epinephrine and ADP (thereby eliminating the morning increase in aggregability to these agents), lengthened collagen lag time, reduced synergistic aggregation to combined agonists, was effective on day 2, and did not alter increases of tissue plasminogen activator that occurred following the subjects' arising. If aspirin prevents myocardial infarction by its antiplatelet action, as seems likely, the preferential reduction of morning infarction observed in the Physicians' Health Study, and the demonstration that aspirin eliminates the morning increase in platelet activity, suggest that the morning increase in myocardial infarction is due in part to a concurrent relatively modest increase in platelet activity.\r"

The frequency of spontaneous premature ventricular complexes in the early subacute postinfarction phase was reduced significantly from 48.4% +/- 10.5% to 8.2% +/- 5.0% of total complexes (p less than 0.01) by the cumulative intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg tocainide. In the late postinfarction setting, the intravenous administration of tocainide (6 mg/kg intravenous loading dose + 100 micrograms/kg/min intravenous maintenance infusion) suppressed the initiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias by programmed stimulation in 5 of 12 animals that were tested and slowed the rate of tachycardia in 3 additional animals. However, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and of the total number of arrhythmia-related deaths that resulted from the occurrence of a secondary ischemic insult in the presence of previous infarction did not differ significantly between tocainide (75% [9 of 12] incidence of both ventricular fibrillation and of total number of arrhythmia-related deaths) and saline-vehicle control groups (80% [12 of 15] incidence of ventricular fibrillation; 93.3% [14 of 15] incidence of total number of arrhythmia-related deaths). These findings suggest that although class I agents such as tocainide may be efficacious in the suppression of spontaneous premature ventricular complexes and ventricular arrhythmias immediately after myocardial infarction, they may be of limited value in the prevention of malignant ischemic arrhythmias that occur later after myocardial infarction.\r"

The experiments were done in six closed-chest dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital, in which pulmonary, cardiac, and intestinal relative blood volumes were determined by equilibrium blood pool scintigraphy. Nitroglycerin (30 micrograms/kg/min) caused 7% (p less than 0.02) and 12% (p less than 0.02) reductions in pulmonary and total cardiac blood volume, respectively, and a 7% (p less than 0.01) increase in intestinal blood volume. This shift of blood from the heart and the pulmonary circulation to the systemic (intestinal) circulation was accompanied by reductions in mean pulmonary artery pressure from 16 +/- 2 mm Hg to 12 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), in mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 11 +/- 2 mm Hg to 6 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), and in mean portal pressure from 9 +/- 1 mm Hg to 8 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The position of the pulmonary vascular pressure-blood volume relationship was unaffected by nitroglycerin, whereas the portal pressure-intestinal blood volume relationship was shifted to the left and upward. These changes suggest that pulmonary vascular tone remained unchanged, whereas intestinal vascular tone decreased during administration of nitroglycerin. In conclusion, nitroglycerin decreased pulmonary vascular pressures through a passive emptying of the pulmonary circulation as a result of increased systemic (intestinal) vascular capacitance.\r"

Streptokinase was given to 188 patients and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to 124. Patients were divided into 2 age groups: less than 60 years (n = 244) and greater than or equal to 60 years (n = 151). Thrombolytic therapy improved ejection fraction in both age groups: from 54 +/- 13 to 59 +/- 11% (p = 0.021) in the younger group and from 50 +/- 14 to 57 +/- 13% (p = 0.004) in the older group. Ejection fraction was identical in streptokinase- and rt-PA-treated patients. Multifactor analysis of variance revealed that younger age and thrombolytic therapy were independently associated with improved ejection fraction. Thrombolytic therapy also reduced end-systolic volume (p = 0.001) by 14 ml in the elderly and 9 ml in the younger group. Minor bleeding complications were more frequent in the elderly and 3 serious hemorrhages occurred in patients greater than or equal to 60 years. These findings reveal that thrombolysis improves LV function in all age groups studied. Because increasing age is independently associated with a lower ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction, thrombolytic therapy may confer greater benefits in older patients.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess whether an increased mortality risk also accompanied the use of these drugs to treat patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Data were obtained from the respective pharmaceutical sponsors on the mortality observed with each drug in United States and foreign protocols enrolling patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Mortality in the encainide population (343 patients) and the flecainide population (236 patients) was compared with that in a research arrhythmia clinic, the Duke population (154 patients). Nine deaths occurred in the combined encainide-flecainide population and 10 deaths occurred in the Duke population; the follow-up periods averaged 488 days and 1,285 days, respectively. The 6-year survival functions of these 2 populations, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier technique, did not differ significantly (p = 0.62). The hazard ratio for the combined encainide-flecainide population relative to the Duke population was estimated to be 0.6 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.2, 1.7.

LPH activity is high in the suckling; in many human populations the activity declines in adults, leading to adult-type hypolactasia, whereas in other populations the high LPH activity persists in adults. In the present work, we compared LPH sequences at the gene and cDNA level among adult subjects with high and low LPH activity. The complete intron-exon organization, including the sequences of all 17 exons and of the borders of all introns (as well as about 1,000 bp of 5' flanking region), was established for the cloned chromosomal LPH gene of a subject with persistence of lactase. Using PCR, we directly sequenced the exons of a hypolactasic subject. Except for silent mutations and the unknown linkage phase at two heterozygous positions, both coding sequences were identical. We further examined the LPH mRNA of a hypolactasic subject by S1 mapping and by sequencing a set of overlapping PCR products produced from cDNA templates. Except for allelic differences, the LPH sequence of the hypolactasic subject was identical to that of the LPH cDNAs of three subjects with persistence of lactase (one cDNA isolated previously by cloning and two characterized in the present work by PCR). No allele was peculiar to the hypolactasic subject. We conclude that humans with high or low levels of lactase can code for identical LPH enzymes.\r"

All subjects belonged to families having lived in the Toulouse area (in the southwest of France) for over three generations. Allele frequencies for each RFLP were in agreement with previous studies in Caucasian populations for the APOA1/SstI marker. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium was determined. Among the 55 pairs studied, 30 are newly reported. Only three significant nonrandom associations were found: APOA1/MspI-3'APOC3/SstI, APOA1/MspI-3'APOA4/XbaI, and APOA4/DraI-APOA4/XbaI. Extended 11-marker haplotypes were constructed. Haplotype frequencies were estimated by the maximum-likelihood procedure and compared to expected frequencies calculated under the assumption of equilibrium. Among the 37 estimated haplotypes, seven containing at least four nonrandomly associated alleles showed markedly increased frequencies. These results, obtained in a geographically homogeneous population, confirm the existence of disequilibrium in the apolipoprotein cluster, but to a lower extent than previously reported in Caucasian populations, which were geographically more heterogeneous.\r"

  ".W": "Severe clinical disease caused by the major human parasite Schistosoma mansoni is the consequence of high and prolonged infections. Epidemiological studies indicate that, for individuals having frequent contacts with cercaria-infested waters, both infection intensities and reinfection after treatment depend, in large part, on their intrinsic susceptibility/resistance to infection, suggesting the role of genetic factors in human resistance to S. mansoni. To investigate whether a major gene controls human susceptibility/resistance to infection by S. mansoni, segregation analysis of infection intensities, adjusted for the factors relevant in schistosomiasis (water contact, age, sex), was performed on 20 Brazilian pedigrees (269 individuals), using both the unified mixed model and the regressive model of analysis. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a codominant major gene controlling human susceptibility/resistance to infection by S. mansoni. Parameter estimates indicate a frequency of .20-.25 for the deleterious allele; thus, about 5% of the population is predisposed to high infections, 60% is resistant, and 35% has an intermediate, although fairly good, level of resistance. These findings provide a genetic basis for earlier observations on the lower resistance and the predisposition to reinfection of certain individuals. In addition to the detection of a major gene effect, the data suggest that immunity to S. mansoni develops progressively during childhood to reach a maximum around the age of puberty. The implications of these results for the strategy to be used in endemic areas to reduce morbidity and to control parasite transmission are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Although 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, there are limitations associated with its use. Consequently, other agents, such as 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), are being assessed for the treatment of patients with HIV infection. However, the most effective therapy for HIV infection may be combination therapy with zidovudine and any of a number of other therapies. To obtain maximum efficacy, combination regimens should include agents that do not share cross-resistance, have different mechanisms of action, and have different dose-limiting toxicities; the relative merits of a concurrent dosage schedule (limits drug failure) and a consecutive dosage schedule (limits toxicity) must also be considered. In addition, the shift between administering a starting regimen and a rescue regimen should be based on time on therapy, disease breakthrough, or drug complication. Eventually, the shift may be precipitated by the in vitro resistance patterns of individual viruses, as is now the case with antibiotics for infection. Several trials are currently in progress to assess combination therapy with zidovudine and ddC; initial results indicate that the combination may allow for improved efficacy and decreased side effects, compared with treatment with either drug alone. Trials of combination therapy with ddI, interferon alfa, and acyclovir are also in progress. It is hoped that these initial studies will pave the way for rational drug sequencing in the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Relative internal concentrations of Na+ and K+ are important in regulating (Na+,K+)-ATPase in situ. Ethanol is known to inhibit (Na+,K+)-ATPase and to reduce K+ affinity, but the concentrations required for these effects in vitro are large compared with those probably attainable in vivo. Yet, there is evidence suggesting that ethanol has physiologically relevant effects on (Na+,K+)-ATPase. We have investigated the effects of ethanol on selectivity for Na+ versus K+. At 150 mM, ethanol had little effect on (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity under the usual assay conditions, slightly (but nonsignificantly) reduced K+ affinity, and had no effect on extrapolated Na+ affinity in the absence of K+. However, ethanol had marked effects on cation selectivity, doubling the Ki for K+ on Na+ affinity and halving the Ki for Na+ on K+ affinity. These data show that ethanol, at concentrations too small for effects on (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity under optimal assay conditions, can alter its responses to changes in Na+ or K+.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acute alcohol ingestion were studied on pulsatile secretion of immunoreactive luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and growth hormone (GH), and on serum bioactive LH, testosterone, cortisol, and prolactin. A dose of 1.5 g ethanol per kg of body weight was administered by mouth to eight healthy male volunteers (aged 20 to 26 years) during 3 hr from 1800 to 2100 hr. Blood samples were collected every 20 min for 20 hr until 1400 hr of the following day. Each subject served as his own control in an identical experiment without ethanol, carried out at least 1 month later. Ethanol ingestion decreased serum testosterone concentration on average by 23% (p less than 0.05) between 10 and 16 hr after starting the drinking. The mean levels of LH and FSH and the mean number and amplitude of LH and FSH pulses remained unchanged. Ethanol ingestion did not affect the biological activity of LH. In each subject alcohol administration reduced the nightly peak of GH secretion, and in addition, changed the timing of this peak in most subjects. Only marginal changes were found in the prolactin levels but ethanol ingestion increased the cortisol levels on average by 36% (p less than 0.05) between 11 and 14 hr after the start of drinking. We conclude that the decrement in serum testosterone evoked by ethanol is not attributable to impaired pulsatile secretion of gonadotropins nor to reduced biological activity of LH. In contrast, ethanol profoundly suppressed the pulsatile secretion of growth hormone.\r"

  ".U": "91206755\r", 
  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is present in adult atria but at very low concentrations in normal adult mammalian ventricles. In the atria, the production of ANP is regulated by physical distension of the atrial wall. The same phenomenon was investigated in the ventricles of rats and men. Cardiac tissues from human ventricular aneurysm (n = 5), spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 30), and rats that had overloaded left ventricles induced by surgery (n = 84) were studied with the methods of light microscopic immunocytochemistry, electron microscopic immunogold staining, and RNA-RNA tissue in situ hybridization. It was found that the levels of ANP gene expression, ANP immunoreactivity, and ANP-containing specific granules in the overburdened ventricles were elevated and their degrees of fluctuation were directly proportional to the force of physical distension applied to the ventricular cardiomyocytes. In rats, ANP mRNA and ANP immunoreactivity returned to the control level seven days after the ventricular overload was surgically released. The changes of ANP and its mRNA in the ventricles were related more closely to the changes of intraventricular pressure than to cardiocytic hypertrophy. In addition, ANP immunoreactivity was demonstrated in Purkinje cells and periarteriolar cardiomyocytes in the ventricles of normotensive rats. In conclusion, physical overstretch of the ventricle wall is likely to be the triggering factor affecting ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property, and also to regulate the production of ventricular ANP, thereby contributing to the control of the blood volume and the blood pressure.\r"

There were significant differences in PAI values avo between PRP (and controls), SSRP, and SRP. PAI activity decreased significantly avo only in controls and in PRP, and there was significant t-PA antigen elevation avo in the same groups. In addition, since PAI is neutralized by activated protein C (PC), both PC antigen and PC activity were assessed avo and bvo. PC Ag remained unchanged in all groups, with PC activity significantly lower than controls in SRP and SSRP. Finally the authors looked for interference of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus-like anticoagulant (LAC) with the PC system in collagen disease-associated RP. Specific IgG ACA were found in only 1 patient with SRP. In conclusion, there is an endothelial derangement, involving t-PA release and PAI, in SSRP and SRP patients. The reduced PC activity in these latter groups appears to be due to increased PAI influence rather than to ACA/LAC.\r"

These lipid mediators share overlapping activities, and current research is directed toward determining the critical molecules involved in the pathogenesis of particular inflammatory states. How may the release of these lipid mediators play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma? Allergic persons after inhalation of specific allergen have a dual bronchospastic response. The early asthmatic response occurring shortly after allergen challenge is most likely secondary to the action of bronchoconstrictor molecules (e.g., LTC4, PGD2, PAF) released by human lung mast cells as a consequence of IgE-mediated degranulation. An inflammatory process than occurs in the airways that is characterized by an influx of eosinophils and neutrophils into the airway epithelium and bronchial fluids. This inflammatory response corresponds to the late asthmatic phase occurring several hours after allergen challenge. Release of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, PAF, and cyclooxygenase products by cells infiltrating the airways may be involved in the bronchial smooth muscle constriction, mucosal edema, and mucus hypersecretion observed during these late asthmatic responses. In the future, the therapeutic use of specific antagonists of the biosynthetic enzymes of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and receptor antagonists of the eicosanoids and PAF holds great promise for the modulation of airway inflammation.\r"

After 2 weeks, the number of CFU in the cage fluid was determined [day 1 mean, (7.25 +/- 0.79) log10 CFU/ml], and treatment with vancomycin (50 mg/kg twice a day [BID]), fleroxacin (50 mg/kg BID), or fifampin (25 mg/kg BID), alone and in combination, was initiated for a duration of 6 days. Concentrations of antibiotics in cage fluids were in the range of those encountered in clinical conditions. Eighteen hours after the last injection (day 7), the number of CFU in the cage fluid was determined and the difference between day 1 and day 7 values was calculated. Rifampin, alone and in combination with fleroxacin or vancomycin, was the most effective regimen in reducing the bacterial counts in the tissue cage fluids [(1.87 +/- 1.44, 2.18 +/- 1.02, and 2.55 +/- 1.09 log10) CFU/ml, P less than 0.001, respectively]. After treatment, cage fluids and cages were analyzed for resistant bacteria. Resistance to rifampin occurred in 15 of 19 cages in animals treated with rifampin alone and in 4 of 25 in animals treated with rifampin plus vancomycin. We detected no development of resistance to rifampin in animals treated with rifampin plus fleroxacin or to fleroxacin in animals treated with this antimicrobial agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Starting on the day when dose 5 was administered, serial blood and T-drain bile samples were taken for 72 h and urine was collected for 96 h. The mean (+/- the standard deviation) peak concentration in plasma was 8.2 +/- 4.0 mg/liter at 8.3 h. The harmonic mean elimination half-life was 10.5 h, which is comparable to that reported for healthy volunteers. This increase resulted from reduced renal clearance (mean [+/- standard deviation], 38 +/- 22 ml/min), as the volume of distribution in the patients (1.4 +/- 0.7 liter/kg) did not differ from that reported for healthy subjects. Maximum concentrations in T-drain bile were high (median, 22.1 mg/liter) and exceeded those measured in plasma by a factor of 2 to 3; the individual ratios of the area under the curve for bile divided by that for plasma ranged from 1.3 to 9.9. As observed in healthy volunteers, the major pathway for elimination of fleroxacin was via the kidneys. The fraction of dose 5 eliminated in the 0- to 24-h urine was reduced, however, and the fraction of the dose in the urine as the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites was elevated. At the dose regimen used in this study, the MICs for most pathogens that cause biliary tract infections were surpassed in plasma and bile for more than 24 h.\r"

  ".W": "Following the use of amikacin as the principal aminoglycoside at a Denver hospital, amikacin resistance appeared first in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and then in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other enteric organisms from debilitated and compromised patients who had spent time in intensive care units and who had been treated with multiple antibiotics, usually including amikacin. In a P. aeruginosa isolate, resistance to amikacin and tobramycin was transferable by the IncP-2 plasmid pMG77, while in E. coli and K. pneumoniae resistance was carried by the transmissible plasmids pMG220, pMG221, and pMG222 belonging to the IncM group. Isolates and transconjugants produced an enzyme with adenyltransferase activity with substrates having a 4'-hydroxyl group, such as amikacin, kanamycin, neomycin, Sch 21768, isepamicin (Sch 21420), or tobramycin, but not with aminoglycosides lacking this target, such as dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin, or gentamicin C components. Genes encoding the 4'-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase [ANT(4')] activity were cloned from pMG77, pMG221, and pMG222. A DNA probe prepared from the ANT(4') found in P. aeruginosa hybridized with the ANT(4') determinant found in E. coli. A probe for the ANT(4') from Staphylococcal spp., which differs in its modification of substrates, like dibekacin, that have a 4\"- but not a 4'-hydroxyl group, failed to hybridize with the gram-negative ANT(4') determinant, which consequently has been termed ANT(4')-II.\r"

  ".W": "The penicillin-aminoglycoside combination is recommended for the treatment of systemic enterococcal infections. However, the optimal dosing regimen of the aminoglycoside remains to be elucidated. We evaluated the efficacy of penicillin, alone or in combination with various dosing regimens of netilmicin, for the treatment of experimental left-sided Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis in rabbits. Animals were injected intramuscularly for 4 days with penicillin alone or in combination with netilmicin in one of the following regimens: netilmicin at a low dose (2 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h), netilmicin at a high dose (4 mg/kg every 8 h), or netilmicin at a single daily high dose (12 mg/kg every 24 h). MICs and MBCs were 3.1 and 6.2 micrograms/ml and 8 and 8 micrograms/ml for penicillin and netilmicin, respectively. A netilmicin concentration of 4 micrograms/ml was the lowest concentration that achieved synergism with penicillin, as shown by the kill-curve method. Mean peak levels of netilmicin in serum were 5.6 (netilmicin at 2 mg/kg), 9.8 (netilmicin at 4 mg/kg), and 20.6 (netilmicin at 12 mg/kg) micrograms/ml. Mean penicillin levels in serum were constantly above the MIC. Penicillin plus netilmicin at a high dose given three times daily was more effective (P less than 0.05) than any other regimen in reducing bacterial titers in vegetations and was the only treatment that induced a significant bactericidal activity in rabbit serum during the trough. We concluded that divided doses of aminoglycoside are more effective than the same total dose given once daily in combination with penicillin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Undernutrition induced by feeding the mothers a low protein diet, on the other hand, decreased the incorporation of labelled precursors into lipids in cortex and stem.

The maximum tolerated dose was estimated to be 30 micrograms/kg. Reversible but severe fatigue and myalgias were the major dose-limiting side-effects; mild leucocytosis and elevations in serum transaminases were noted and were reversible. Non-dose-related reversible mental status changes were seen in six patients and were considered to be associated with the drug. This was usually manifest as dementia, but progressed to coma in two patients. This reversed, but the sequelae resulted in death in one patient. Decreases in serum p24 antigen levels were noted 1 month after the first infusion in 10 of 18 patients who entered the study with elevated levels; one converted to negative. Values usually remained low to the end of the study period (2 months). In those patients with CD4+ cell levels greater than 50 x 10(6) cells/l significant decreases in sedimentation rate and increases in CD4+ cell numbers were also noted.

  ".W": "Platelet von Willebrand factor (vWF) has been suggested to play an important role in the hemostatic process. Clinical and experimental data indicate that bleeding time (BT) and platelet-vessel wall interaction cannot be normalized unless the defect of platelet vWF is also corrected. We have examined the effect of normal platelet concentrate transfusion 1 hour after cryoprecipitate infusion in five type III von Willebrand disease (vWD) patients. The cryoprecipitate infusion attained normal circulating levels of ristocetin cofactor, vWF antigen, and factor VIII activity. In two patients, cryoprecipitate infusion did not modify the BT (greater than 30 minutes), whereas in the remaining three patients BT was only partially corrected (from greater than 30 to 12, 18, and 21 minutes). However, the immediate platelet transfusion completely corrected the BT in four cases, and in one case it shortened the BT to 8.30 minutes (n = 3 to 8 minutes). In the perfusion study, cryoprecipitate infusion only resulted in a slight increase in platelet deposition (surface coverage range: 2.4% to 11.3%), whereas the platelet concentrate transfusion elicited a more marked improvement (range: 8.2% to 26.4%; P less than .02 v post-cryoprecipitate). These results suggest an important in vivo role of the platelet vWF in supporting platelet-vessel wall interaction. They also give support to the occasional addition of normal platelet transfusion to the cryoprecipitate infusion for the control of serious bleeding episodes resistant to cryoprecipitate in severe vWD patients.\r"

  ".W": "To study the interaction of human factor VIII (FVIII) with its various ligands, select regions of cDNA encoding FVIII light chain were cloned into the plasmid expression vector pET3B to overproduce FVIII protein fragments in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Partially purified FVIII protein fragments were used to produce monoclonal antibodies. One monoclonal antibody, 60-B, bound both an FVIII protein fragment (amino acid residues 1563 through 1909) and recombinant human FVIII, but not porcine FVIII. This antibody prevented FVIII-vWF binding and acted as an inhibitor in both the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay and a chromogenic substrate assay that measured factor Xa generation. The ability of the antibody to inhibit FVIII activity was diminished in a dose-dependent fashion by von Willebrand factor. This anti-FVIII monoclonal antibody bound to a synthetic peptide, K E D F D I Y D E D E, equivalent to FVIII amino acid residues 1674 through 1684. The 60-B antibody did not react with a peptide in which the aspartic acid residue at 1681 (underlined) was changed to a glycine, which is the amino acid present at this position in porcine FVIII. Gel electrophoretic analysis of thrombin cleavage patterns of human FVIII showed that the 60-B antibody prevented thrombin cleavage at light chain residue 1689. The coagulant inhibitory activity of the 60-B antibody may be due, in part, to the prevention of thrombin activation of FVIII light chain.\r"

  ".W": "In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in the absence of severe infection, marked fibrinolysis was noted in comparison with normal levels of antithrombin III, which is a major inhibitor of the coagulation system. Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels in plasma from patients with septicemia decreased the ratio of the plasma clot lysis rate induced by an anti-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor monoclonal antibody to the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentration. This decrease was not as prominent in plasma from patients with DIC, especially those with APL. To explore the character of PAI-1 in these plasmas, we measured the specific activity of PAI-1 by determining the ratio of active PAI-1 antigen to t-PA-unbound PAI-1 antigen. To calculate the amount of active PAI-1 antigen, the amount of t-PA/PAI-1 complex before and after the addition of a fixed amount of t-PA to the sample was measured by a sandwich solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-PAI-1 and anti-t-PA monoclonal antibodies. The assay to measure total PAI-1 antigen used three monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies and had similar sensitivities to free active, latent, vitronectin-bound and t-PA-bound PAI-1. The specific activity of PAI-1 decreased in patients with DIC (43.7% +/- 30.6%) and in DIC cases with APL (10.3% +/- 6.0%) in comparison to patients with septicemia (83.7% +/- 20.2%) or normal controls (85.8% +/- 27.3%). In DIC associated with APL, degraded forms of PAI-1 were detected in plasma by immunoblotting. These results suggest that a decrease in the specific activity of PAI-1 and an increase in secondary fibrinolysis result in a hyperfibrinolytic state in DIC patients with APL.\r"

  ".W": "In three lymphoma cell lines carrying t(14;18), named FL-18, FL-218, and FL-318, the genomic organization of IgH gene was compared with the expression of bcl-2 gene; the t(14;18) of the FL-18 cells occurred downstream from the major breakpoint cluster region (mbr) of a bcl-2 gene, and that of the FL-218 and FL-318 cells within the mbr. The FL-318 expressed the normal-sized bcl-2 transcript of 8.5-kb mRNA having the noncoding region 3 to the mbr, which was found in the FL-18, and the FL-218 lacking the intact bcl-2 gene did not. This finding suggests that in t(14;18)-positive lymphoma having the breakpoint within the mbr, transcription of the nontranslocated bcl-2 allele is not necessarily silent. In addition, the FL-218 and FL-318 expressed aberrant bcl-2 transcripts and heterogenous IgH transcripts lacking the VH region, and the bcl-2 transcripts each comigrated with parts of the sterile IgH mRNAs. The FL-318, which did not exhibit switch recombination on either IgH allele, contained abundant amounts of l gamma mRNAs, a prerequisite for the recombination into the C gamma locus. One of the I-mRNA species comigrated with the aberrant bcl-2 transcript. The FL-18 and FL-218 lacking the I gamma mRNAs had completed switch recombination of both IgH alleles. This result raises a possibility that deregulated bcl-2 transcription caused by t(14;18) is capable of playing a role in class switch recombination of IgH gene.\r"

Thirteen anti-Slds identified tumor cells from 31 of 105 (30%) CLL patients and 4 of 6 SLL patients. In comparison, the same panel of anti-Slds is reactive with 33% of follicular and diffuse B-cell lymphomas. Ten of these anti-Slds reacted with CLL cases at similar frequencies to that of the B-cell lymphomas. Two anti-Slds, which are known to react with autoantibodies, were significantly more prevalent in CLL than in B-cell lymphomas. These data confirm the presence of Slds in CLL and provide further evidence of an association between CLL and autoimmunity. The identification of a panel of antibodies reactive with a significant number of CLL and SLL patients will facilitate the application of anti-idiotype antibody therapy in these diseases.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the development and characterization of a method for the amplification of rearranged V-J segments of the human T-cell receptor gamma chain (TCRG) locus using an adaptation of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The technique uses a single pair of 'consensus' primers to amplify rearrangements involving the V gamma I subgroup genes, which are common in malignant cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Using this method we were able to detect rearrangements in the TCRG locus in disease cells from patients with T-cell ALL (12 of 12), common ALL (10 of 14), and Null cell ALL (2 of 2) at presentation. Monoallelic and biallelic rearrangements involving V gamma I subgroup genes were identified by restriction analysis of PCR products from DNA samples from a T-cell leukemic cell line, T-cell clones, and disease cells from patients with ALL of T-and B-cell lineage at presentation. These results confirmed the presence of cell clones within the presentation samples and, in one case, confirmed the persistence of the original malignant cell clone at relapse. This is a rapid and specific method for the detection and characterization of rearrangements of the TCRG locus without recourse to Southern blotting. Therefore, the PCR technique described herein can provide the basis for the study of clonal evolution and minimal residual disease on a high proportion of patients with ALL.\r"

A substantial proportion of spontaneous tumors are class I-deficient and numerous experiments have suggested that alterations in class I expression may alter oncogenicity and, as a result, have potential therapeutic impact. Interferons (IFNs) are able to upregulate class I expression by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated, but which appear to be IFN- and cell-type specific. We have characterized in detail the in vivo class I transcriptional response to IFN-gamma in two human hematopoietic tumor cell lines, the class I-deficient K562 cell line and the class I-positive Ramos cell line. In each, IFN-gamma induces a rapid increase in class I transcription, which is sustained in Ramos cells, but transient in K562 cells. In each, stimulation by IFN-gamma is dependent on ongoing protein synthesis, suggesting the requirement for production of a \"primary response\" protein. These data suggest that more than one type of IFN-gamma-induced signal is operative in the transcriptional response to IFN-gamma. Cycloheximide alone is also capable of inducing a rapid increase in class I transcription in both cell types, suggesting that constitutive attenuation of class I transcription may be a common phenomenon, and that IFN-gamma may act, in part, by interfering with such attenuation.\r"

Dose levels ranged from 30 to 500 micrograms/m2/d. At doses at or below 250 micrograms/m2/d, toxicity felt to be caused by rhGM-CSF was negligible. However, three of five patients treated with 500 micrograms/m2/d had unacceptable side effects caused by rhGM-CSF. Two different graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens were administered. Twenty-seven evaluable patients were administered regimens that did not contain methotrexate (MTX) (Group I) and reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL by a median of day 14. In contrast, 18 patients who received GVHD prophylactic regimens containing MTX (Group II) reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL on a median of day 20. Patients in Group I had fewer febrile days and, of those discharged, had shorter initial hospitalizations than patients in Group II. The overall incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade 2 or greater) in the rhGM-CSF-treated patients was 28% and was similar to that in historical \"good risk\" patients who did not receive rhGM-CSF. These preliminary data suggest rhGM-CSF is unlikely to exacerbate GVHD in HLA-identical sibling donor transplants and indicate the need for randomized trials of rhGM-CSF in allogeneic marrow transplant patients.\r"

In spite of diligent research to isolate a cancer-causing microorganism, none has been found. Similarly, Livingston-Wheeler's autologous vaccine cannot be considered an effective treatment for cancer. While many oncologists have expressed the hope that someday a vaccine will be developed against cancer, the cause(s) of cancer must be determined before research can be directed toward developing a vaccine. The rationale for other facets of the Livingston-Wheeler cancer therapy is similarly faulty. No evidence supports her contention that cancer results from a defective immune system, that a whole-foods diet restores immune system deficiencies, that abscisic acid slows tumor growth, or that cancer is transmitted to humans by chickens.\r"

  ".W": "Table 5 presents risk factors for breast cancer generally regarded as established, together with their approximate relative risks. With the exception of age, country of birth, and a history of breast cancer in both a mother and a sister, all of the relative risks reported to date are of a relatively modest magnitude. Thus, new risk factors need to be identified and knowledge of existing risk factors refined. Factors for which the evidence of an etiologic role has mounted over the past several years, but which are not yet considered to be established, include the protective effects of parity and lactation in certain age groups and the increased risks associated with alcohol consumption and with DES exposure during pregnancy. In addition, physical activity has emerged as a factor worthy of further study. Some evidence suggests that use of oral contraceptives for several years at an early age modestly increases the risk for breast cancer diagnosed before age 35 and perhaps age 45. Use of estrogen-replacement therapy for 20 years or more has been found by a few studies to increase the risk for breast cancer in the postmenopausal years; further studies of very long-term users are needed. Also, other risks and benefits of these hormones need to be taken into account when women decide whether to use them. Surprisingly elusive has been the etiologic role of endogenous hormones, especially in view of the large number of studies that have been concerned with them. A better understanding of the role of endogenous hormones should help explain the mechanisms of action of known and suspected risk factors. Areas of high priority for further research thus include establishing with more certainty whether the risk for breast cancer is increased in any subgroups of women who use oral contraceptives and estrogen-replacement therapy and determining the etiologic roles of specific endogenous hormones. The possible risks associated with alcohol consumption and lack of physical activity need to be studied more thoroughly, and ideas about new potential risk factors are needed. Although epidemiologic studies will continue to be concerned with diet, enthusiasm for its etiologic role in women has been considerably dampened by the lack of association in many of the studies reported to date. The studies in women exposed to radiation, DES, and oral contraceptives suggest that the timing of some exposures may be critical, since the effects of these agents may mostly be limited to specific time periods of rapid breast development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "\"Laetrile\" is used interchangeably with \"amygdalin\" to designate natural substances, derived primarily from apricots and almonds, that can release cyanide, which is lethal to living organisms. In the 1920s, Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Sr., formulated a theory that amygdalin could kill cancer cells. His theory was inconsistent with biochemical facts and has since been modified at least twice by his son, Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. Extensive work has been done by cancer scientists to test the claim that Laetrile fights cancer. Many animal experiments in the 1970s showed a complete lack of tumor killing by Laetrile. Reviews of the medical records of patients whose cancers were claimed to be reduced or cured after Laetrile treatment found insufficient medical evidence to judge Laetrile's efficacy. Finally, in a clinical trial in cancer patients reported in 1982, Laetrile neither caused shrinkage of tumors, nor increased survival time, nor alleviated cancer symptoms, nor enhanced well-being. Several reports in the medical literature document instances in which Laetrile has caused serious, life-threatening toxicity when taken in large doses in the manner prescribed by Laetrile advocates. In light of the lack of efficacy of Laetrile and its demonstrated ability to cause harm, Laetrile should not be used to treat cancer.\r"

  ".U": "91208718\r", 
  ".W": "An increase in cytosolic free calcium (Cai) has been shown to occur early during ischemia in perfused rat, ferret, and rabbit hearts. It has been proposed that this increase in Cai may occur as a result of exchange of Nai for Cao, which occurs as a result of an increase in Nai arising from exchange of Nao for H+i. The latter exchange is stimulated by the intracellular acidification that occurs during ischemia. To test this hypothesis, we examined Cai, Nai, ATP, and pHi during ischemia in rats in the presence and absence of 1 mM amiloride, a Na-H exchange inhibitor. Cai was measured using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid (5F-BAPTA)-loaded rat hearts. Nai was measured using 23Na NMR, and the shift reagent 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N\",N\"'-tetramethylenephosph onate (Tm[DOTP]-5) was used to separate Nai and Nao. ATP and pH were determined from 31P NMR measurements. During 20 minutes of ischemia, amiloride did not significantly alter the ATP decline but did significantly attenuate the rise in Nai and Cai. After 20 minutes of ischemia, time-averaged Cai was 1.0 +/- 0.2 microM (mean +/- SEM) in amiloride-treated hearts compared with 2.3 +/- 0.9 microM in nontreated hearts. After 20 minutes of ischemia, Nai in the untreated heart was threefold greater than control, whereas in the amiloride-treated heart, Nai was not significantly different from control. These data are consistent with the involvement of Na-Ca exchange in the rise in Cai during ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic therapy with quinapril on the temporal progression of left ventricular failure and survival was assessed in the CHF 146 cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster, which is an idiopathic model of congestive heart failure. Age-matched Golden Syrian (GS) hamsters served as normal controls. Quinapril was administered in the drinking water at average daily doses of 10.2, 112.4, and 222.4 mg/kg/day. In untreated CM hamsters, in vitro left ventricular performance progressively deteriorated with increasing age beginning at roughly 180 days. This decline in left ventricular performance was accompanied by a decrease in coronary flow and an increase in left ventricular volume. Administration of quinapril from 180 to 300 days of age prevented the decline of in vitro left ventricular contractile performance and coronary flow and also reduced the age-dependent increases in left ventricular volume. The cardioprotective effects of quinapril were observed at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day. Lung angiotensin converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by quinapril in GS and CM hamsters at 240 and 300 days of age at all dose levels. In contrast, significant inhibition of ventricular angiotensin converting enzyme activity was observed consistently at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day quinapril but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day. In the survival protocol, CM and GS hamsters were treated with vehicle or quinapril (100 mg/kg/day) from 180 to 522 days of age. During the initial 210 days of treatment (from 180 to 390 days of age) 78.3% of the vehicle-treated CM hamsters died compared with 27.7% of quinapril-treated CM hamsters. Quinapril increased the median survival time of CM hamsters by 32.9% (112 days). It is concluded that chronic quinapril therapy exerts a significant cardioprotective effect and also increases survival.\r"

  ".U": "91208726\r", 
  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine whether protein kinase C mediates bradykinin-induced increases in microvascular permeability. Permeability of the hamster cheek pouch was evaluated using intravital fluorescent microscopy and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (MW 70,000). We examined effects of sphingosine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, on bradykinin-induced increases in permeability. Increases in permeability were quantitated by counting the number of leaky sites and calculating the clearance of FITC-dextran. During bradykinin (10(-6) M), leaky sites increased from 0 to 40 +/- 4 (mean +/- SEM) sites/0.11 cm2, and clearance increased from 1.7 +/- 1.0 to 22 +/- 9 ml/sec x 10(-6). The bradykinin type-2 receptor antagonist D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin virtually abolished formation of leaky sites in response to bradykinin. To determine whether changes in microvascular pressure contribute to the increase in leaky sites, venular pressure was measured using a micropipette and survo-null device. Increases in cheek pouch venular pressure were similar during application of bradykinin and adenosine, which increased permeability, and isoproterenol, which did not increase permeability in the cheek pouch. Thus, increases in permeability were not linked to changes in microvascular pressure. The protein kinase C inhibitor, sphingosine (10(-6) M), markedly attenuated responses to bradykinin. Leaky sites increased from 0 to only 2 +/- 1 sites/0.11 cm2, and clearance increased from 3.9 +/- 1.4 to only 6.7 +/- 2.2 ml/sec x 10(-6). To test the specificity of sphingosine, we examined effects of adenosine (10(-6) M). Sphingosine did not significantly alter increases in microvascular permeability in responses to adenosine. We also examined effects of 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), another protein kinase C inhibitor, on responses to bradykinin and adenosine. H-7 greatly attenuated formation of leaky sites during stimulation with bradykinin and did not alter the number of leaky sites produced during adenosine. The findings suggest that protein kinase C may mediate increases in vascular permeability in response to bradykinin.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment of the pulsatile mechanical behavior of the coupled left ventricle and the peripheral arterial circulation requires accurate estimation of instantaneous aortic flow. Before the availability of Doppler technologies, this could only be achieved by invasive techniques. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of Doppler-based measurement of instantaneous aortic blood flow and waveform morphology throughout ventricular ejection when compared with an established invasive method. Accordingly, data from electromagnetic flow and continuous-wave aortic Doppler recordings were simultaneously acquired and compared in five monkeys over a wide range of flows generated by intravenous infusions of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine and the alpha-receptor agonist methoxamine. Instantaneous aortic pressure was measured using a high-fidelity micromanometer-tipped catheter placed in the ascending aorta. Excellent correlations were noted for stroke volume, cardiac output, left ventricular ejection time, maximal flow velocity, and maximal rate of change of flow velocity (dQ/dtmax). When compared with electromagnetic flows, continuous-wave aortic Doppler had significantly lower times to maximal flow velocity and dQ/dtmax. Frequency domain analysis indicated that both the magnitude and phase were within +/- 6% up to the third harmonic. Instantaneous comparison disclosed that during early systole (up to 10% of ejection) Doppler was higher than electromagnetic flow rate by 11 +/- 19% (p less than 0.05). At 20-30% of systolic ejection, electromagnetic flow rates were slightly higher than Doppler (5 +/- 4% at 20% of ejection, p less than 0.001 and 2 +/- 3% at 30% of ejection, p less than 0.05). From 40% of ejection to the end of systole, flow rates using both techniques were virtually identical.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In vivo, a marked difference in blood oxygen tension exists between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Responses of vascular endothelial cells from these vessels to changes in ambient oxygen might be influenced by the oxygen tension to which they are continuously exposed in vivo or by their anatomic site. To explore this hypothesis, we initially studied the production of the cyclooxygenase metabolites prostacyclin and thromboxane in bovine aortic and main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells grown in 21% O2 and exposed to different degrees of acute hypoxia over a wide range of times. We found that short-term hypoxia (3% or 0% O2) rapidly and transiently activates the cyclooxygenase pathway in both cell types, with a more rapid response in bovine aortic endothelial cells. To determine whether culture in an oxygen tension similar to that to which main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells are exposed in vivo alters this response, we evaluated these cyclooxygenase metabolites in bovine aortic and main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells cultured long-term in 3% O2, both at baseline and after exposure to acute anoxia (0% O2). In both cell types, we found a decrease in prostacyclin and thromboxane synthesis at baseline and evidence of an increase in the Vmax of thromboxane synthetase following stimulation with exogenous arachidonic acid. In chronically hypoxic cells exposed to acute anoxia, there were marked differences in enzyme activity compared with that in endothelial cells maintained in 21% O2 with differences depending on the origin of the endothelial cells. In bovine aortic endothelial cells, production of neither cyclooxygenase metabolite increased; in bovine main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, only thromboxane production increased, suggesting isolated activation of the cyclooxygenase-thromboxane synthetase pathway. These studies demonstrate that acute and chronic hypoxia have profound effects on endothelial cell cyclooxygenase metabolism and that these effects depend on the duration and degree of the hypoxic exposure and the vascular bed from which the endothelial cells are derived.\r"

  ".W": "The use of bovine tendon as a xenograft material in humans is attractive because of its ready availability and favorable mechanical characteristics. Previous research has shown that the fibroblasts and some extracellular proteoglycans and glycoproteins, not the collagen matrix itself, in bovine tendon are primarily responsible for its antigenicity. Various attempts have been made to decrease the antigenicity of these grafts. A chloroform/methanol (CM) extraction procedure has been developed that selectively removes the fibroblasts from bovine tendon without destroying the collagen matrix. The mechanical, immunologic, and local host tissue responses to these grafts were compared to autografts and to untreated and glutaraldehyde-treated bovine tendon xenografts. The humoral immune response to a purified bovine Type I collagen product was also studied. The central two-thirds of a rabbit Achilles tendon were replaced with a reversed autograft or an experimental graft. Histologic examination of one- and two- week specimens showed an acute inflammatory response to all grafts. Untreated grafts stimulated a severe inflammatory response and were almost completely resorbed by two weeks. Glutaraldehyde-treated grafts were encapsulated. Cellular repopulation was minimal and inflammatory response was more persistent than in the autograft and CM groups. Inflammatory response to CM-treated grafts was similar to that of autografts. The CM grafts repopulated rapidly with host cells. The mechanical strength of CM grafts was equal to autograft controls at 12 weeks. The mechanical strength of untreated and glutaraldehyde-treated grafts was significantly lower. Measurement of the humoral immune response to these grafts was conducted in an independent group of animals using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A significant antibody response to untreated, glutaraldehyde-fixed, and CM-treated grafts was detected at 30 days. Antibody titers to glutaraldehyde-fixed and untreated grafts remained elevated at 60 and 90 days. In the CM group, antibody titers decreased to the level of autograft controls by 90 days. No significant antibody response was detected toward purified bovine Type I collagen.\r"

SETTING: A general adult ICU in a community teaching hospital. PATIENTS: All patients receiving PA balloon flotation catheters over a 1-yr period. INTERVENTIONS: Groups 1 and 2 received PA catheters with and without protective sleeves, respectively. Indications for catheter changes, other than catheter malposition, were the same for both groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In group 1, 54 patients received 71 catheters and four catheters were replaced due to the inability to obtain a PA occlusion pressure (PAOP) tracing. In group 2, 48 patients received 66 catheters, 11 of which were inserted due to failure to obtain a PAOP (p less than .05). PA catheters were repositioned successfully in 37/56 attempts in group 1, compared with 8/20 attempts in group 2 (p less than .05). There was no significant difference in complication rates between the two groups. Even at the increased cost of the protective sleeves and introducer ($7/kit), for 100 catheter insertions, we project a direct cost savings of $742, and personnel time savings of 10.5 hrs for physicians, 14 hrs for nurses, and 4.7 hrs for radiology technicians.

It would be expected that tuberculous pleural fluid contains a variety of immunologically important cytokines because of the accumulation of immunocompetent cells in the pleural cavity. We studied interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in pleural fluid of 20 patients with tuberculous pleurisy and compared them with those in pleural fluid of 20 patients with malignant pleurisy. We also evaluated adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in both effusions. Tuberculous pleural fluid had higher levels of IL-1, IL-2, IFN-gamma, and ADA than malignant pleural fluid. Although the difference of IL-1 level between tuberculous and malignant pleural fluid was modest, that of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and ADA was dominant. These findings suggest that activated T lymphocytes in tuberculous pleural fluid concern the production of lymphokines at the morbid site and they effectively exert local cellular immunity through the action of such lymphokines.\r"
