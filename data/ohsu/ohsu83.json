  ".W": "The relationship between arrhythmia density observed during ambulatory monitoring, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), and response to antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated in 94 patients presenting with ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 20) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 74). Following baseline studies, an average of 4.9 antiarrhythmic drugs were tested singly in each patient. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the density of VT on baseline ambulatory monitoring and initial left ventricular EF were independent predictors of drug efficacy. The 45 patients with an EF less than or equal to 35% responded to 34 +/- 29% of drugs tested, whereas the 49 with an EF greater than 35% had arrhythmia suppression with 46 +/- 28% of agents (p less than 0.038). Patients exhibiting VT during greater than or equal to 50% of monitoring hours responded to 32 +/- 26% of drugs, whereas those with VT during less than 50% of hours showed arrhythmia suppression with 48 +/- 29% of antiarrhythmic agents tested (p = 0.009). During a mean follow-up period of 12.9 months, the annual sudden death mortality for all patients was 9.3%. However, 8 of the 55 patients responding to less than 50% of drugs tested died suddenly and 17 had recurrent VT. By contrast, only 1 of the 39 patients responding to greater than or equal to 50% of the antiarrhythmic drugs tested died suddenly and two experienced recurrent VT (p = 0.00005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Follow-up was obtained on 78 of 79 patients (99%). All patients were followed up for 1 month to 25 years (mean 9 years). Their ages at follow-up ranged from 24 to 70 years (mean 42 years). Nonsurgically treated patients who were New York Heart Association functional class I before treatment had a significantly better survival rate than had those who were functional class II to IV (p less than 0.001). Nonsurgically treated patients with cardiomegaly had a significantly poorer survival experience than had those without pretreatment cardiomegaly (p less than 0.001). Medical patients also had significantly poorer survival rates if the mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure was greater than 50 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The 10-year survival rate for all patients was 76%. In general, adult patients with ventricular septal defect treated medically remained clinically stable over a long follow-up period, but survival was significantly influenced by pretreatment functional class, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and cardiomegaly.\r"

Nine dogs had 15 different episodes of reproducible monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (11 sustained and 4 nonsustained) (group A). Seven episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (group B) were induced in six dogs, three of which degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. Epicardial activation time during premature stimulation at the time of tachycardia induction was more prolonged in group A than in group B (183 +/- 43 vs 123 +/- 35 msec, p less than 0.01). Furthermore, induction of ventricular tachycardia was preceded by the development of functional block in 13 of 15 group A tachycardias, but in only three of seven group B tachycardias. During polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, epicardial activation patterns were radial from the earliest epicardial activation site, similar to those observed during left ventricular endocardial pacing. QRS polymorphism was associated with a beat-to-beat variation in the earliest epicardial activation site. In conclusion, inducibility of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is less dependent on the epicardial activation sequence than on monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.\r"

We assessed the efficacy and safety of closed-chest catheter desiccation of the left ventricular myocardium with microbipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy (750 kHz) in five dogs. The unipolar configuration was used with RF energy delivered between the tip electrode of a standard No. 7F tripolar catheter in the left ventricle and an external patch electrode on the left lateral chest wall. A single application with different RF energy settings (100 J, 200 J, and 300 J) was delivered to three individual endocardial sites of the left ventricle. Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation was not observed during energy application and 24 hours after ablation, as assessed by a Holter recording. There was no damage to the electrode catheter. Dogs were killed on the fifth day. Pathology showed well-delineated ovoid or round-shaped coagulation necrosis at the ablation sites. Microscopic findings consisted of circumscribed areas of necrosis surrounded by a zone of fibroblastic and mononuclear proliferation. In conclusion, catheter ablation of the ventricular myocardium with RF energy is an apparently safe procedure and can effectively produce discrete areas of injury without destruction of surrounding uninvolved myocardium. This method offers potential clinical utility for catheter ablation of refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia.\r"

The patients selected for PTCA had predominantly single-vessel disease and a normal or slightly abnormal left ventricular function. PTCA was successful in 87% (62/71) of the patients and unsuccessful in 13% (9/71). There were no deaths related to PTCA. The incidence of myocardial infarction during the procedure was 10% (seven of the 71 patients). Urgent bypass surgery was necessary in 11% (eight of 71 patients) of the patients. All patients were followed up for 12 months. There was one late death and one late nonfatal myocardial infarction. During 12 months of follow-up there was recurrence of angina pectoris in 25% of the patients (14/62). The restenosis rate was 25% (13/52) in the patients with an initial successful PTCA who underwent repeat angiography. Improved cardiac functional status after sustained successful PTCA was demonstrated by the normal exercise capacity on bicycle exercise testing and the absence of ischemia on thallium 201 scintigraphy studies in 70% of the patients. At the 1-year follow-up visit after attempted coronary angioplasty in all 71 patients, the total incidence of deaths was 1.5% (one patient), myocardial infarction 11% (eight patients), and the need for revascularization 25% (emergency surgery eight patients, late surgery three patients, and repeat PTCA seven patients); 91% (64 of 70 patients) were symptom free. It is concluded that PTCA in selected patients with unstable angina initially stabilized with medical treatment is an effective treatment with an acceptable complication rate and an excellent 1-year prognosis.\r"

The erythrocyte endothelial cell adhesion index was highest when both cell types were sialidase treated (0.35 vs control 0.00 [p less than 0.05]). When sialidase (50 U/ml) was added to whole blood in plastic tubes, the mean clotting time was 7.17 +/- 1.0 (SD) minutes (n = 8) compared with a mean control of 15.45 +/- 3.9 minutes (p less than 0.01). Sialidase had no effect on prothrombin or partial thromboplastin times. The above studies suggest that increased plasma sialidase activity in patients with acute myocardial infarction may be associated with clumps of desialylated erythrocytes that may alter flow in the microcirculation.\r"

The processes of thrombus formation and thrombolysis were examined by vascular fiberscope. Laminar mural thrombi developed in all 21 preparations 10 minutes after blood reperfusion, with stenosis formation. Over 50% luminal obstruction with thrombi occurred in 10 preparations 30 minutes after inducing stenosis. Total occlusion with thrombi occurred in four preparation (31%) at 1 hour, and in all nine at 3 hours after inducing stenosis. Usually, red thrombus at the denudated region grew in size distal to the sited of stenosis. Histologically, thrombi of less than 1 hour duration consisted of a loose fibrin network and those of over 3 hours' duration consisted of a dense fibrin network. Infusion of 144,000 IU of urokinase (UK) reduced the size of thrombi less than 1 hour old during fiberoptic observation. However, UK infusion of similar dose failed to recanalize two of four preparations with 3-hour-old thrombi. In conclusion, arterial thrombi that closely simulate those observed clinically can be made by endothelial denudation and partial occlusion, and the vascular fiberscope provides a useful method for analysis of thrombosis and thrombolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental myocardial infarction of the posterolateral wall of the left ventricle was produced in dogs by injecting 80 micron microspheres into the left circumflex coronary artery to determine changes in regional myocardial function after infarction, to examine how the changes in regional myocardial function relate to the changes in global left ventricular function, and to examine the relationship between regional wall motion and wall thickening after myocardial infarction. Serial measurements of global ventricular and regional myocardial function were made in six dogs before and during 20 days after infarction, with the use of M-mode echocardiography and chronic Swan-Ganz catheter implantation. One hour after infarction, stroke volume index had decreased 49% from baseline, percent fractional shortening had decreased 52%, lateral wall motion had decreased 80%, and lateral wall thickening had decreased 100%. By 6 days after infarction, stroke volume index had increased 41% from its low point, percent fractional shortening had increased 34%, and lateral wall motion had increased 100% toward but not to baseline. Lateral wall thickening did not return following infarction. Peak and end-systolic circumferential wall stresses and systemic arterial blood pressure remained stable. End-systolic diameter increased acutely (36%) after infarction and did not change during the 20-day time period, while end-diastolic diameter gradually increased, resulting in the increase in percent fractional shortening. In conclusion, after posterolateral wall infarction, wall motion can return without an improvement in regional myocardial function, presumably because the infarcted region stiffens, allowing it to be pulled inward.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In all of the patients the diagnosis was confirmed anatomically. Dextran (200 to 900 ml), administered to 10 patients, induced a significant increase in systolic blood pressure, cardiac index, stroke index, right atrial pressure, and pulmonary capillary pressure. Dobutamine (500 micrograms/min for 20 to 40 minutes), was infused in 16 patients and induced a significant increase in systolic blood pressure, cardiac index, stroke index, and heart rate. Pericardiocentesis, with extraction of 150 to 500 ml, was performed in five patients. It produced a significant increase in systolic blood pressure, cardiac index, and stroke index and a significant decrease in right atrial pressure and heart rate. The best results were obtained after pericardiocentesis. However, it must not be performed in every case because of its potential risk. Dextran and dobutamine may be sufficient in many cases to support these patients before surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Amiodarone is commonly used with the automatic implantable defibrillator to treat recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The effects of acute intravenous and chronic oral amiodarone on the energy requirements for successful defibrillation were evaluated in 12 dogs chronically instrumented with right atrial spring and left ventricular patch defibrillation electrodes. Multiple shocks of varying energy were applied in balanced random order to construct curves of percent successful defibrillation vs energy (DF curves) on each test day. Dogs were studied on days 1, 11, 18, 25, and 32. On day 11, DF curves were determined before and after infusing saline (n = 6) or amiodarone (n = 6), 10 mg/kg loading and 0.33 mg/kg/min maintenance doses. Dogs administered intravenous amiodarone were continued on oral drug (300 mg twice daily) for the remainder of the study. Data were analyzed by logistic regression and the energy required for 50% (E50) and 80% (E80) successful defibrillation were compared. Differences between controls and animals receiving chronic oral amiodarone were not significant on any day. After acute intravenous infusion, dogs given amiodarone had a 21.7 +/- 12.8% decrease in E50 (p less than 0.01) and a 19.7 +/- 17.8% decrease in E80 (p less than 0.05), while controls had an 11.4 +/- 30.5% increase (p = NS) in E50 and 6.30 +/- 30.5 increase in E80 (p = NS). It is concluded that the energy required for successful defibrillation is decreased by acute intravenous amiodarone, while chronic oral administration has no significant effect.\r"

  ".W": "Although digitalis and vasodilators both enhance cardiac performance in patients with congestive heart failure, their relative efficacy is unknown. Accordingly, the acute hemodynamic effects of intravenous hydralazine (0.15 mg/kg), digoxin (1.0 mg), and the hydralazine-digoxin combination were evaluated in 14 normotensive heart failure patients at sitting rest, nine of whom were also studied during submaximal upright bicycle exercise. Hemodynamic responses at rest and exercise were similar. Cardiac output and stroke volume rose with both agents, the increase in cardiac output with hydralazine exceeding that with digoxin at rest. Left and right ventricular filling pressures declined equally. Systemic arterial mean pressure and total systemic vascular resistance fell with hydralazine, while, with digoxin, systemic arterial mean pressure increased and total systemic vascular resistance was unchanged. The hydralazine-digoxin combination produced increases in cardiac output and stroke volume that were greater than with either drug alone, and that equalled the sum of the drugs' individual effects; reductions in ventricular filling pressures were similar to the single-drug interventions. Thus, hydralazine is at least as effective as digoxin in improving cardiac function over the short term. Vasodilators may constitute an acceptable alternative to digitalis as initial therapy for congestive heart failure, except where a reduction in systemic arterial pressure is potentially deleterious. Use of combined treatment produces greater increases in cardiac output than with either drug alone, but requires risking the toxicities of two agents.\r"

All eighteen patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure demonstrated hemodynamic improvement following intravenous bolus therapy. Dose-related increases in cardiac index occurred, ranging from a 12 +/- 6% increase following a 12.5 micrograms/kg bolus to a 37 +/- 10% increase after 75 micrograms/kg. Pulmonary wedge pressure fell 17 +/- 5% following 12.5 micrograms/kg and 28 +/- 9% following 75 micrograms/kg. Little change was apparent during the continuous infusion except for a late increase in cardiac index, but similar changes occurred in response to a single oral dose. Forearm blood flow increased significantly after 3 hours in the two higher infusion groups, but there was no consistent change in hepatic blood flow. We conclude that hemodynamic parameters and forearm blood flow are improved in patients with severe congestive heart failure following intravenous and short-term oral milrinone therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Traditionally, assessment of therapy has been judged by the ability of treatment to alleviate symptoms with tolerable side effects or toxicity. In recent years, it has become obvious that more subtle and patient-oriented approaches are urgently needed to evaluate progression of cardiovascular disease and to monitor the efficacy of medical and surgical therapy. Aspects of well-being include physical, emotional, and social status in cardiovascular diseases. While several major assessment methods are available within the social sciences, experiences with the use of comprehensive questionnaires in cardiovascular diseases remains relatively limited. Self-administered questionnaires have been shown to be more reliable than those given by a trained interviewer. Two forms of questionnaires--the visual analogue scale and the one in which patients check off boxes--can be used to quantify symptoms, but the former necessitates more time spent on patient information. Measurements of quality of life can be characterized by the test's validity, reproducibility, and sensitivity. Our information on the sensitivity of life-quality tests is so far scarce, but it has recently been shown that it is possible to discern the effect of various drug treatments in hypertension. The methodology of this assessment needs to be further optimized, and the quality of life parameters need to be correlated with hemodynamics, exercise capacity, morbidity, and mortality.\r"

  ".U": "87267251\r", 
  ".W": "Psychosomatic elements, behavior, and sympathetic overactivity are presumed to underlie many cardiovascular diseases; the most investigated conditions are borderline hypertension and type A/B behavior. Many patients with borderline hypertension show signs of hyperkinetic circulation, that is, elevated heart rate and cardiac index. This elevation is neurogenic, since it can be abolished with a combination of beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade. Response to such stepwise blockade shows a larger beta-adrenergic and a lower parasympathetic change in cardiac tone, characteristic of the functional organization of the medullary integrative centers of cardiovascular control. The most likely cause for this abnormal integration is psychosomatic. These patients may be expected to respond to treatment with behavioral and/or cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents. There is little doubt that type A behavior is a predictor of coronary heart disease. The description of the pathophysiology of these transient but characteristically excessive cardiovascular episodes is difficult, however. Type A individuals do not always hyperreact in the same way; the response can be limited to heart rate, blood pressure, or occasionally exaggerated urinary or plasma catecholamine responses. In our laboratory we concentrated on steady markers of type A behavior. Type A subjects had reproducibly larger pupil size--indicative of increased sympathetic arousal--higher heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, and significantly elevated platelet epinephrine values when challenged by a mental task. Treatment with behavioral methods, beta-blocking agents, or both might be useful for prevention of coronary heart disease in type A individuals.\r"

While serial improvement in global left ventricular ejection fraction was not demonstrated for the group, infarct zone regional wall motion did improve (-2.7 +/- 0.9 vs -2.3 +/- 1.4 SD/chord, p less than 0.007). Serial improvement in global ejection fraction was demonstrated in the subgroup of patients treated within 2 hours of symptom onset (55 +/- 10 vs 62 +/- 10%; n = 5; p less than 0.03). Infarct zone regional wall motion improved serially only in the subgroup of patients treated within 3 hours of symptom onset (-2.4 +/- 1.1 vs -1.3 +/- 1.7 SD/chord; n = 11; p less than 0.007). Patients with initially patent arteries had a higher ejection fraction on follow-up catheterization than did those with initially occluded vessels (61 +/- 11 vs 55 +/- 7%; p less than 0.02), and patients with patent arteries at follow-up had a higher ejection fraction than did those whose arteries were occluded (60 +/- 9 vs 48 +/- 4%; p less than 0.0001). We conclude that significant improvement in global and regional left ventricular function in patients with inferior myocardial infarction is possible when reperfusion therapy is begun early or when arterial patency is achieved.\r"

One patient had substantial proximal and distal conduit obstruction in addition to valvular stenosis, and balloon dilation valvuloplasty was not attempted. No complications occurred in five patients; one patient required iliac vein exploration to remove an avulsed balloon fragment. Balloon dilation valvuloplasty can relieve bioprosthetic valve stenosis and postpone conduit replacement in some patients.\r"

The relationship between echocardiographic determinations of left ventricular mass, volume, and cavity radius to wall thickness ratio and defibrillation threshold for the implantable defibrillator was examined. Ten patients with two large patch defibrillating lead systems were studied. Defibrillation threshold was determined intraoperatively as the lowest energy terminating ventricular fibrillation. Left ventricular mass, volume, and radius/posterior wall thickness ratio were calculated from two-dimensional echocardiograms. A significant correlation was found between left ventricular mass and defibrillation threshold (r = 0.78, p less than 0.01). The correlations between defibrillation threshold and left ventricular volume (r = 0.59) and radius/wall thickness ratio (r = 0.55) were not significant. Subsequently, 11 dogs undergoing defibrillation trials with a transvenous catheter and a chest wall patch were studied. Defibrillation threshold was defined as the lowest energy-terminating ventricular fibrillation (four separate attempts). Subsequently, the heart was dissected, and the left ventricle (including the septum) was weighed. The correlation between left ventricular weight and defibrillation threshold (r = 0.76) was significant (p less than 0.01). We conclude that noninvasive assessment of left ventricular mass and direct measurement of left ventricular weight are significantly correlated with defibrillation threshold and consistent with the critical mass hypothesis.\r"

Prior to amiodarone therapy, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was initiated in all patients at control electrophysiologic study; patients failed a mean of 5.7 drugs, as assessed by programmed electrical stimulation. At electrophysiologic study after a loading phase (1000 mg/day for 10 days), 10 patients had no inducible ventricular tachycardia, nine patients had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 13 patients had persistent sustained ventricular tachycardia, and one patient had ventricular fibrillation. Patients were continued on amiodarone alone regardless of the findings at the electrophysiologic study, and during follow-up patients with no inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation on amiodarone had no recurrent arrhythmias or sudden death. Six of 14 patients (43%) with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias still inducible had recurrent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, and four of them died suddenly (29%). Programmed electrical stimulation predicts a good clinical long-term outcome during amiodarone therapy. Patients with persisting fast tachyarrhythmias (cycle length less than or equal to 300 msec) on amiodarone and a low ejection fraction (less than 35%) seem to have a higher incidence of sudden death. In these patients, therapeutic approaches such as antiarrhythmic surgery or implantation of antitachycardia devices should be considered.\r"

There was no correlation between serum amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels and toxicity; although there was a trend toward elevated reverse serum triiodothyronine levels in patients who developed toxicity, the values fell within the range of those patients without toxic side effects.

Open-label sotalol was given in individually titrated divided doses of 160 to 800 mg/day (median 323, mean 386 mg/day). Response was assessed at approximately 1, 6, and 12 months or until patient discontinuation. The period of sotalol therapy averaged 9 months (range, 0.2 to 22.7). At about 1 month, 13 (59%) of 22 patients showed effective control of arrhythmia. The median percentage change in total PVCs for individual patients at 1 month was -70% and for repetitive PVCs it was -95%. At about 6 months, 10 (45%) of the 22 patients continued to be successfully treated; at about 12 months, seven patients continued on sotalol, six (27%) successfully treated according to Holter criteria. Reasons for discontinuation included lack of efficacy in nine, adverse effects in four (fatigue in three, bradycardia with sinus pauses in one), and miscellaneous reasons in two. ECG PR and especially QTc intervals increased significantly during therapy (p less than 0.02, p less than 0.01, respectively). In summary, sotalol is a moderately effective antiarrhythmic agent in patients with complex PVCs, but during long-term therapy a rather high dropout rate was observed because of arrhythmia recurrence or adverse effects.\r"

In 23 patients the right ventricular refractory period was determined before and after the introduction of bipolar, unipolar cathodal, and unipolar anodal noncapturing Sc with pulse widths of 2 or 9 msec and strengths of twice diastolic threshold and 10 MA. Pacing and conditioning stimuli were delivered at the same site and at sites separated by 3 mm. During ventricular pacing both bipolar and unipolar Sc prolonged the ventricular refractory period by greater than or equal to 10 msec in 22 of 23 patients when both Sc and pacing stimuli were delivered to the same site. However, when Sc was delivered 3 mm away from the pacing stimuli, the ventricular refractory period increased by greater than or equal to 10 msec in only 1 of 17 patients who received bipolar Sc and in none of 13 patients who received unipolar Sc. In seven patients bipolar conditioning stimuli were delivered as close as possible to the atrial insertion of an accessory atrioventricular connection during circus movement tachycardia with a well-localized accessory pathway.

  ".W": "The use of more than one right ventricular site for programmed electrical stimulation has been reported to increase the number of patients in whom ventricular tachycardia can be provoked. To determine a possible reason for these observations, programmed ventricular tachycardia studies were evaluated in 316 patients (185 men and 131 women) with a mean age of 63 +/- 7 years who presented with ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest. The underlying cardiac disease was atherosclerosis (81%), cardiomyopathy (15%), valvular heart disease (3%), and miscellaneous conditions (1%). Programmed electrical stimulation studies employed a six-beat pacing train, at a cycle length of 500 msec with the introduction of one to three premature stimuli at twice diastolic threshold at the right ventricular apex. If ventricular tachycardia at the right ventricular apex could not be provoked in a patient, the study was repeated at the right ventricular outflow tract. A total of 36 patients were studied at the right ventricular outflow tract. Eleven (31%) were provoked into ventricular tachycardia, while 25 (69%) were not. No difference existed between the QRS, QT, and QTc intervals between those having ventricular tachycardia provoked at the outflow tract compared to those without inducible tachycardia at the right ventricular outflow tract. The effective refractory period was 280 +/- 5 msec at the right ventricular outflow tract in those patients not inducible, and 226 +/- 4 msec in those inducible (p less than 0.05). We defined the change in ventricular refractory period as the difference in the effective refractory period at the right ventricular outflow tract minus the effective refractory period at the right ventricular apex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "While the electrophysiologic effects of sudden changes in cycle length on the His-Purkinje System and ventricular myocardial refractoriness are better known, the behavior of atrial myocardium in this regard is poorly understood. The effects of an abrupt long to short cycle length change (11 patients: group A) and/or short to long cycle length alteration (18 patients: group B) on the atrial effective and functional refractory period were assessed during electrophysiologic studies. The values thus obtained were compared to those observed during the scanning of both constant long and constant short cycle lengths of the same duration. In group A the effective and functional refractory periods of the right atrium measured 250 +/- 38 msec and 296 +/- 31 msec during a constant long cycle length of 709 +/- 80 msec, whereas the same parameters had values of 228 +/- 30 msec and 260 +/- 32 msec, respectively, at a constant short cycle length of 436 +/- 81 msec. With an abrupt change in cycle length from long to short (a change of 273 +/- 75 msec), the effective and functional atrial refractory periods were 225 +/- 29 and 267 +/- 29 msec in that order, and these values closely approximated those seen with a constant short cycle length. Similarly, the two atrial refractory period parameters in group B measured 218 +/- 16 msec and 262 +/- 19 msec during a constant short cycle length of 414 +/- 68 msec and were 236 +/- 17 msec and 284 +/- 21 msec, respectively, at a constant long cycle length of 689 +/- 92 msec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The range of variation of sinus cycle length (SCL; standardized by dividing by mean SCL) and the maximal change in SCL between any two consecutive cycles (max delta SCL) were measured in short (about 1 minute) continuous ECG recordings from invasive electrophysiologic investigations. Age-stratified reference values from 1 minute surface ECG recordings obtained at rest during quiet breathing in about 70 healthy persons were applied. For diagnosing SND, an increased standardized variation range had a sensitivity of 63%, a specificity of 94%, and a predictive value of a positive test of 95%. The corresponding figures for an increased max delta SCL were 77%, 78%, and 85%, respectively. A combination of increased range of variation and increased max delta SCL was observed in 63% of the patients but not in any healthy subject, which gives a specificity and a predictive value of a positive test of 100% for this combination.\r"

In all patients the tachycardia involved the accessory pathway in retrograde atrial activation. Between midnight and early morning the more relevant findings with respect to the first testing performed at midday were a significant prolongation of the effective refractory period of the atrial (from 212 +/- 22 msec to 229 +/- 22 msec; p less than 0.01), atrioventricular node (from 235 +/- 22 msec to 285 +/- 15 msec; p less than 0.005), right ventricle (from 209 +/- 15 msec to 221 +/- 12 msec; p less than 0.001), and retrograde Kent bundle (from 278 +/- 34 msec to 294 +/- 24 msec; p less than 0.01) and a reduction of the inducibility of tachycardia from both the coronary sinus from 90% to 50%; p less than 0.001) and the right ventricle from 80% to 15%; p less than 0.001). Thus our results indicate that there exists a nocturnal protection against electrical induction of reciprocating tachycardia that is associated with a prolongation of the atrial, atrioventricular nodal, ventricular, and Kent bundle refractoriness.\r"

A pilot study in four patients showed that unexpectedly low plasma levels (less than 40 ng/ml) were obtained 60 minutes after administering 160 mg or 240 mg of verapamil during SVT. Nuclear studies in the six other patients showed that fractional liquid gastric emptying times (T) were significantly prolonged in SVT compared to sinus rhythm (SR), p less than 0.05 from T 1/3 onward. Further verapamil absorption studies (200 to 360 mg) performed during SVT and SR in five of six patients showed that peak verapamil levels in four patients in SVT were 23% to 71% lower than in sinus rhythm, where they had peaked at greater than 250 ng/ml 60 minutes post verapamil ingestion, and areas under the plasma concentration time curves were 26% to 100% (mean 67%) less in SVT than in SR for all five patients. SVT was terminated by verapamil in one patient after 40 minutes and the rate of SVT was slowed after 90 minutes in two other patients. Thus plasma verapamil levels are considerably reduced during SVT as compared to SR, and changes in gastric emptying are likely a contributing cause. Since SVT was converted to sinus rhythm in only 1 of 10 patients within 1 hour, large oral doses of verapamil tablets appear unsatisfactory for the episodic treatment of SVT.\r"

In 20 patients, mitral regurgitant Doppler signal areas were clear enough to measure. Injections of phenylephrine were given to these patients during the recording of the mitral regurgitant Doppler signal area in the same views and with the same Doppler gains. The mitral regurgitant Doppler signal area, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured before and after phenylephrine provocation. In addition, inhalation of amyl nitrite was performed during the recording of the mitral regurgitant Doppler signal area in the same way. Injection of phenylephrine resulted in an increase in the mitral regurgitant Doppler signal area accompanied by an increase in blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate. On the other hand, inhalation of amyl nitrite resulted in a decrease in the mitral regurgitant Doppler signal area, a decrease in blood pressure, and an increase in heart rate. A positive correlation between the change in blood pressure and that in the mitral regurgitant Doppler signal area was observed. In conclusion, two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography may be useful in the assessment of the acute change in regurgitant volume in the patient with mitral regurgitation.\r"

Despite this, the mean QT intervals in the two groups differed by only 7 msec and a t test showed no significant difference between the groups. The prevalence of QT prolongation was exaggerated by Bazett's rate correction formula (62%) or historical control groups published by Simonson (58%) or Ashman (70%). Simultaneous QT and QS2 intervals were measured in 67 patients with mitral prolapse. Inversion of the normal QT:QS2 relationship occurred in nine patients (13%) and was more common in the presence of severe mitral regurgitation. It was not associated with an increased prevalence of absolute QT prolongation and was therefore thought to be caused by relative shortening of the QS2 interval. In conclusion, the prevalence of QT prolongation in mitral prolapse is low (11%). The QT:QS2 ratio is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of QT prolongation in these patients.\r"

At a low paced heart rate of 170 bpm, cardiomyopathic hearts did not differ from normal hearts except for a lower developed left ventricular pressure. As pacing rate was increased progressively to 270/min, cardiomyopathic hearts showed prolongation of contraction, which led to a pronounced rise in diastolic pressure as the interstimulus interval shortened. This was accompanied by a marked decrease in energy-rich phosphorus compounds. By contrast, increasing heart rate in normal hearts did not change left ventricular pressure and caused only a mild reduction in energy-rich phosphorus compounds. Intracellular pH of cardiomyopathic animals paced at 270 bpm was significantly lower than in normal animals. Thus, indices reflecting mitochondrial function of 155- to 170-day-old cardiomyopathic hamsters appear adequate at low heart rate. Increasing the heart rate unmasks latent mitochondrial dysfunction.\r"

Mechanical constriction of the main pulmonary artery in newborn lambs compromised left ventricular function with significant decreases in systemic blood flow and the peak first derivative of left ventricular pressure when considered simultaneously and as single variables. In contrast, alveolar hypoxia augmented left ventricular function with significant increases in systemic blood flow and the peak first derivative of left ventricular pressure when considered simultaneously or as single variables. Interaction appears to exist between the right and left ventricles during the newborn period. The mechanically increased afterload may have compromised left ventricular function by altering its end-diastolic size, inotropic state, or both. On the other hand, the augmented left ventricular function in the presence of hypoxia may have been due to an increase in inotropic background. The clinical implications in some infants with pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction are raised.\r"

Inclusion criteria were NYHA class II (n = 16) or III (n = 14) despite at least 3 months of treatment with digitalis and diuretics, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) greater than 50 mm, and exercise capacity limited by dyspnea or fatigue. Patients were treated with diuretics (100%), digitalis (83%), and vasodilators (60%) and were followed for at least 6 months (mean 15). The 1-, 2- and 3-year cumulative survival rates were 75.4%, 70.2%, and 70.2%, respectively. Univariate predictors of survival included measured peak VO2 (p = 0.0026), as well as age, estimated peak VO2 (based on exercise time), presence of left bundle branch block, LVEDD, and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias. Multivariate analysis revealed that measured peak VO2 was the single best independent predictor of survival (p less than 0.001). We conclude that assessment of functional capacity provides useful independent prognostic information in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.\r"

Case reports have appeared implicating all classes of antiarrhythmic drugs. It is difficult to assess the size of the problem in practice, as it varies with different subgroups of patients, but rates of up to 13% have been found where proarrhythmic effects were actively sought. Their occurrence is affected both by the electrophysiologic characteristics of the drugs and by the arrhythmia substrate. Mechanisms of proarrhythmic effects may be classified according to the electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of the drugs. Detection of drug-induced arrhythmias depends on appreciation of the problem by physicians and, although there are few clear predictors, some form of monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug treatment is recommended. Management of such arrhythmias when they occur involves withdrawal of the offending agent, correcting contributory factors, and reassessing the initial arrhythmia and the strategy for its management.\r"

Patients were followed prospectively for up to 100 months and were categorized based on the survival period from the time of catheterization. Hemodynamic variables that showed significant differences or prognostic trends were RVedp, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, PCWP, CI, PVR, and PVR/SVR ratio. The CI correlated with the number of survival months (r = 0.583; p less than 0.01). The hemodynamic state of patients who died suddenly within 1 year from the time of catheterization was no different from those who died of clinical right-sided heart failure. The partial pressure of oxygen of arterial blood was the only variable discriminating sudden deaths from right-sided heart failure deaths (54 +/- 2 vs 66 +/- 4 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). The results of this study indicate that the major determinant of prognosis is right ventricular function and that the CI might be used as a prognostic indicator. In addition, sudden death is more likely to occur in patients with severe hypoxia.\r"

A number of antecedent metabolic risk factors proved atherogenic, including blood lipids, glucose tolerance, uric acid, and menopause. Serum total cholesterol predicts as strongly in women as in men. The predictive power of cholesterol is strengthened when the total cholesterol is partitioned into its atherogenic LDL and protective HDL fractions. Contrary to the case in men, triglyceride may be a contributor to risk in older women. A total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio exceeding 7.5 equalizes the risk in men and women. Impaired glucose tolerance also eliminates the female CHD risk advantage over men, conferring a three-fold increased risk. Serum uric acid, although lower in women than in men, is equally predictive in the sexes. Central obesity confers an increased CHD risk in women and predisposes to diabetes, hyperuricemia, hypertension, and an unfavorable LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio. A combination of obesity, low HDL cholesterol, and impaired glucose tolerance predisposes especially. Age-adjusted risk of CHD is increased two- to threefold compared to pre menopausal women, even when induced surgically without removing the ovaries. It is not clear whether post menopausal estrogen replacement eliminates this excess risk. Fibrinogen is higher in women than in men, and is increased with hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, high hematocrit, and cigarette smoking. At any level of multivariate risk, fibrinogen added to the CHD risk in women.\r"

This physiologic property suggests that these agents have a potential role in the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. Although the clinical response to calcium antagonism in hypertension is promising, the response in patients with congestive heart failure is less than hoped for; this is due to the fact that this class of agents may induce a hemodynamically important degree of negative inotropic effect. To test the hemodynamic response to nicardipine, a second-generation dihydropyridine, the hemodynamic response to maximal ergometric exercise was evaluated in a group of patients with moderate to severe chronic congestive heart failure. One week of nicardipine therapy was associated with a significant reversal of vasoconstriction at rest and during peak exercise with a secondary increase of cardiac index, and a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure. The reversal of vasoconstriction was associated with a decrease in mean arterial pressure, with no change in the heart rate. There was no change in oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production; however, there was a decrease in arteriovenous oxygen difference, consistent with a reduction of oxygen extraction. This short-term study identified the potent vasodilator properties of nicardipine in patients with chronic congestive heart failure; a hemodynamically significant negative inotropic effect could not be identified. Although the use of calcium antagonists for the treatment of congestive heart failure may have a limited role, this study nonetheless suggests that nicardipine may have a favorable vasodilator effect without an overt negative inotropic effect. This would be of considerable advantage in the treatment of hypertension, when compared with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.\r"

Other indicators of ischemia--angina, ST-segment depression, a decrease in ejection fraction and wall motion abnormality during exercise--were present frequently but not uniformly in these patients. Although most patients had a decline in ejection fraction and a new wall motion abnormality with exercise, 4 patients had an increase in ejection fraction with exercise without any regional wall motion abnormalities. Coronary angiography in the 27 patients with systolic hypotension demonstrated severe coronary artery disease (CAD). Twenty-two patients (81%) had 3-vessel or left main CAD. Twenty of these 22 patients with 3-vessel CAD had at least 2 arteries with 90% or more diameter stenoses. Systolic hypotension during supine exercise radionuclide angiography is infrequent, usually associated with evidence of global and regional left ventricular dysfunction, and a marker of very severe CAD.\r"

The recovery treadmill ejection fraction analysis was predictive of the peak bicycle results in 18 of the 21 patients (86%) and recovery treadmill wall motion abnormalities were predictive of the peak bicycle analysis in 17 (81%) (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that 2-D echocardiography during the immediate recovery phase of low-level postinfarction treadmill testing was as sensitive as the peak exercise assessment of segmental and global LV function. Accordingly, the predictive value of rest and recovery exercise measures were prospectively assessed in 67 patients during a mean follow-up interval of 11 months (range 3 to 24). Clinical characteristics and treadmill electrocardiographic findings did not identify the 16 of 67 patients (24%) who had new cardiac events (3 cardiac deaths, 8 recurrent AMIs and 6 coronary artery bypass graft operations).

In all subjects left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic, end-systolic and stroke volumes progressively decreased, with mean reductions of 21%, 40% and 14%, respectively, on ascent to 25,000 feet (PB 282 torr) at rest, and reductions of 23%, 43% and 14% during 60-W exercise. At PB 282 torr, mean arterial blood O2 partial pressures were 37 torr (rest) and 32 torr (exercise), with corresponding O2 saturations of 68% and 59%. All 3 indexes of LV systolic function examined--ejection fraction, ratio of peak systolic pressure to end-systolic volume and mean normalized systolic ejection rate at rest--were sustained in all subjects at high altitude despite reduced preload, pulmonary hypertension and severe hypoxemia. Increases in ejection fraction of 6% at rest and 10% during exercise developed at PB 282 torr and a higher mean normalized systolic ejection rate in association with elevated circulating catecholamines reflecting enhanced sympathetic activity. LV systolic function is not a limiting factor in compromising the exercise capacity of normal humans on ascent to high altitude, even to the peak of Mt. Everest.\r"

Thus, digitized M-mode echocardiograms were recorded in 24 persons younger than 50 years with long-term (more than 12 years) type 1 diabetes but without overt heart disease and in 28 control subjects. To improve accuracy, measurements were adjusted for body surface area, LV size and the influence of heart rate, as appropriate. Diabetics had a higher heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure than control subjects. LV end-diastolic and stroke dimensions were smaller, duration of systole longer and preejection period/LV ejection time ratio higher than in control subjects, whereas fractional shortening and peak shortening rate were similar. In diabetics, diastole was shorter, peak filling rate was lower and the rapid filling period was prolonged, while percent filling during the rapid filling period and atrial contribution to filling were higher. Thus, in a well defined study population of relatively young persons with long-term type 1 diabetes, subclinical LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction were found. The diastolic abnormalities suggest reduced LV compliance, while those in systole may be secondary to an increased afterload or decreased myocardial contractility.\r"

Skeletal muscle, postmortem hearts and excised myocardium confirmed the anisotropic echocardiographic characteristics of these muscles. The short-axis ventricular views in vitro and in vivo gave a distinct pattern of echo amplitudes within the myocardium that is consistent with fiber orientation as a major factor in this pattern. A different pattern in apical long-axis views of the basal septum and free wall also is consistent with fiber orientation, but detracts from attenuation as a major cause of \"dropout\" in short-axis views. Choice of an optimal echocardiographic view for evaluation of wall thickness and ventricular function may be influenced by improved understanding of the factors involved in image formation.\r"

Sixty-one consecutive patients who underwent both exercise thallium-201 (TI-201) imaging and cardiac catheterization for evaluation of chest pain that developed after discharge from the hospital for AMI form the study group. Mean interval between infarction to the TI-201 study was 10 +/- 17 months. Initial and 2-hour delay TI-201 images were analyzed quantitatively to determine the presence and location (within vs outside the prior infarct zone) of TI-201 redistribution, a marker of ischemic viable myocardium. TI-201 imaging results were separated into 3 groups based on presence and location of TI-201 redistribution: no significant TI-201 redistribution was found in 16 patients; in 29, TI-201 redistribution was confined to the infarct zone; and in 16, TI-201 redistribution was outside the infarct zone. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the comparative ability of TI-201 results and other patient variables to predict cardiac events. For total cardiac events (cardiac death, recurrent nonfatal AMI, unstable angina and coronary revascularization), both the presence of any TI-201 redistribution and multivessel angiographic coronary artery disease were significant predictors. However, when coronary revascularization was excluded as an endpoint, TI-201 redistribution limited to the prior infarct zone was the only significant predictor of cardiac events. All 8 cardiac events occurred in patients with T1-201 redistribution limited to the infart zone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intraobserver and interobserver variability in the subjective interpretation of angiographic regional wall motion was quantitated in 135 contrast left ventriculograms showing a wide range of normal and abnormal cardiac function, and the effects of rating-scale complexity and myocardial regional differences were examined. Three experienced observers separately graded endocardial motion on a 6-point scale (0 = normal to 5 = dyskinesia) in each of 5 regions. Scores were also tabulated on a 3-point scale and as normal or abnormal. Average intraobserver agreement (2 evaluations per observer) was 68% using the 6-point scale, 86% using the 3-point scale and 90% for normal/abnormal. Interobserver agreement (3 observers) was 47% for exact agreement using the 6-point scale, 75% using the 3-point scale and 80% for normal/abnormal. Interobserver agreement was 84% within a range of 1 wall motion grade on the 6-point scale. Subjectively normal wall motion was most frequent in the 2 basal segments and least frequent in the apical and anterolateral segments. Disagreements were most frequent in the latter 2 segments, but when normal segments were excluded, these interregional differences disappeared. Thus, intraobserver and interobserver agreement is higher than previously reported, and may exceed 80%. Variability depends on whether regional wall motion is normal, but is also affected by the complexity of the rating scale. The distinctions implied by a 6-point subjective rating scale are probably not reliable, but variability is greatly reduced by use of a simplified scoring system.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past few years, the clinical use of echocardiography has continued to expand. Echocardiographic techniques are used widely to define normal and abnormal cardiac anatomy, evaluate cardiac chamber sizes and dynamics, assess valvular and pericardial diseases, detect intracavitary masses, measure pressure gradients across discrete stenoses, determine flow volumes, detect and assess the severity of valvular regurgitation, demonstrate and quantitate intracardiac shunts, and measure the timing of cardiac events. These and related applications have led to the increasing use of echocardiography in the diagnostic evaluation of many cardiac disorders. Echocardiography requires considerable theoretical knowledge, technical skill and practical experience to be used in an optimal manner. Previous publications have suggested guidelines for physician training in the techniques of M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiography. The clinical applications of echocardiography continue to grow, however, and Doppler techniques for evaluating blood flow have become an established component of the echocardiographic evaluation of many disorders. This article presents the current recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography as to the background knowledge, the nature and amount of practical experience, and the type of training site that are optimal for the training of physicians who take responsibility for the conduct and interpretation of echocardiographic studies.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the recent interest in contrast-enhanced echocardiography as a means of defining myocardial perfusion, the effects of echo contrast agents on left ventricular (LV) contractility in humans remains poorly defined. This is particularly relevant because intracoronary injection of contrast agents used for angiographic visualization of coronary arteries produces significant alterations in LV hemodynamics. The relation of LV end-systolic wall stress (sigma es) to rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening (Vcfc), a load-independent index of contractility, was studied in 7 patients undergoing elective coronary arteriography. Two-dimensional and targeted M-mode echocardiographic and central aortic pressure tracings were recorded during injections of standard volumes of angiographic (7 to 9 ml of nonsonicated Renografin-76) and echocardiographic (1.5 to 2.0 ml of sonicated Renografin-76) contrast agents into the left main coronary artery. The order in which agents were injected was randomly determined. Myocardial contractility was assessed under control conditions and 5 and 15 seconds after injection. Alterations in contractility relative to control were measured as the change in Vcfc after elimination of afterload (sigma es) as a confounding variable. An injection of Renografin-76 adequate for angiographic imaging of coronary artery anatomy resulted in a significant depression of LV contractility (p less than 0.001) in conjunction with a tendency toward increased afterload (p = 0.12); recovery occurred by 15 seconds after injection. The smaller amounts of sonicated Renografin-76 required to give adequate contrast enhancement of the myocardium did not alter LV contractile state or afterload.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, data supporting such an association are limited, and an alternative hypothesis that cardiac vomiting is related to infarct size has also been advanced. The 2 hypotheses were tested in a cross-sectional study of 265 patients consecutively admitted to the coronary care unit. Nausea or vomiting was a good predictor of myocardial infarction (p less than 0.0001). The odds of having an infarction was 3.14 times greater for patients with nausea or vomiting than for those without these symptoms. Nausea was not a good predictor for inferior wall infarction (p = 0.14): 51% of patients with inferior infarcts had nausea or vomiting and 66% with anterior infarcts had these symptoms. Using peak serum creatine kinase level as an index of infarct size, nausea or vomiting was a good predictor of larger infarction. While 55% of all patients with infarction had nausea or vomiting, for patients with infarctions that produced a peak creatine kinase level of more 1,000 IU/liters, 78% had nausea or vomiting. Sex was a marginally important variable. After adjusting for sex, the presence of nausea or vomiting still predicted infarct size (p less than 0.001). Thus, cardiogenic nausea and vomiting are associated with larger myocardial infarctions but do not suggest infarcts in a particular location.\r"

This interval was greater than 5 years in 17 patients (85%) and greater than 10 years in 11 patients (55%). The ages at the first clinically apparent acute myocardial infarct ranged from 36 to 72 years (mean 51).

At necropsy, the heart weight was increased (greater than 400 g) in all (mean 557 g), the left ventricular cavity was dilated in all, and at least 1 and usually 2 or 3 (86%) major epicardial coronary arteries were narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area by atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, patients with calcified myocardial infarcts are usually men, they usually have a myocardial infarct that calcifies at a relatively young age, the calcified wall is usually part of an aneurysmal wall, the left ventricular cavity is almost always dilated, heart weight is increased, and progressive congestive heart failure is the usual mode of death.\r"

In each patient a series of 4 to 13 consecutive days, in the absence of therapy, with 8 or more ischemic episodes per day were analyzed. Harmonic regression models were fitted to the hourly number of ischemic episodes and the hourly values of HR. Out of 54 days, with 8 or more episodes per day for a total of 1,357 episodes, a circadian rhythm was observed for 34 days (64%), in at least 1 day in all patients and during the entire period of observation in only 3. Its presence was independent of the number of episodes; the peak of periodic functions occurred at 2.9 +/- 2.7 AM. A cadian rhythm for HR was observed in 61 of the 70 days (87%), consistently in 7 patients; the nadir occurred at 2.4 +/- 1.5 AM; simultaneous cycling in HR and transient ischemia was found on 32 days. The intrapatient difference between the peak and the nadir of the ischemic and the HR function was, on average, 2.6 +/- 3.3 hours. Thus, a circadian rhythm of ischemic episodes was present in all patients although it was not consistently present; simultaneous occurrence of circadian variation in ischemic episodes and HR was observed only in 60% of the days with a sufficiently high number of attacks and when this occurred, a significant phase shift was observed; occasional loss of HR cycling was observed in some patients, without an apparent cause.\r"

To better define the restenosis process, a quantitative analysis was performed of coronary angiographic morphologic characteristics at restenosis, before and immediately after PTCA.

Immediately after PTCA, stenosis diameter (0.7 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.6 mm, mean +/- standard deviation, p less than 0.05) was increased; percent stenosis (77 +/- 11 to 34 +/- 16%, p less than 0.05), neck index (1.2 +/- 1.4 to 0.5 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.05) and irregularity (9 of 22 patients) were decreased. At follow-up, quantitative coronary morphologic values in most cases were similar to those before PTCA. There were individual changes, which occurred in an unpredictable and highly variable fashion, so that average values were not changed. The eccentricity ratio was not significantly changed by angioplasty or at restenosis. Thus, although successful PTCA results in specific changes in angiographic coronary stenotic morphology, these are reversed by the restenosis process.\r"

The individually prescribed range of heart rate corresponded to 65 to 77% of the peak value during symptom-limited treadmill testing (mean of 72% for men and 69% for women). Caloric expenditure per training session was approximately 345 kcal for men and 235 kcal for women. VO2 max increased 15% in men and 9% in women (both p less than 0.01). The greater increase in VO2 max in men than in women primarily reflected greater adherence to training in men (greater than or equal to 90% vs greater than or equal to 75%). The increase in VO2 max in women who showed very high adherence was comparable to that of men. Body weight decreased, by 1.5 +/- 10 kg, in men (p less than 0.05) but not in women undergoing training. No significant training-induced changes in plasma lipid levels were noted in either men or women. Baseline orientation and follow-up telephone calls required less than 1 hour of staff time per participant. Self-monitored, moderate-intensity, home-based exercise training significantly increases functional capacity in healthy, middle-aged men and women. Such training provides an alternative to group-based exercise training.\r"

  ".U": "87267350\r", 
  ".W": "In 28 patients with Kawasaki disease, the relation of specific echocardiographic findings identified during the acute study of the illness, including valvular regurgitation, to development of coronary aneurysms was evaluated. Initial studies were performed at the time of clinical presentation, 5 to 10 days after the onset of fever, and follow-up studies were performed 1 to 2 months later. Patients in whom coronary aneurysms developed were more likely to have pericardial effusion (p = 0.0006) or mitral regurgitation (MR) (p = 0.014) at initial echocardiographic study than those without aneurysms. Presence of either mitral regurgitation (MR) or pericardial effusion had a positive predictive value of 0.84 for aneurysm development. Twenty-three percent of patients had MR, and it was associated with mild LV dilatation (35 +/- 3 vs 32 +/- 5 mm, p less than 0.05). Insufficiency of other valves was rare. Thus, MR and pericardial effusion on acute phase echocardiographic examination may predict development of coronary aneurysms in Kawasaki disease. Mild MR occurs frequently in acute Kawasaki disease and is associated with mild LV dilation.\r"

  ".W": "Programmed stimulation and signal-averaged electrocardiography were performed in 43 consecutive patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) after healing of inferior (29 patients) or anterior wall (14 patients) acute myocardial infarction. Twenty-two patients had inducible sustained VT. Patients with inferior infarction and inducible sustained VT had significantly longer filtered QRS durations (125 +/- 19 vs 112 +/- 15 ms, p less than 0.01) and significantly lower voltage in the last 40 ms of the filtered QRS complex (19 +/- 5 vs 30 +/- 14 microV, p less than 0.05) than those without inducible sustained VT. In contrast, the signal-averaged electrocardiographic measurements in patients with anterior infarction and inducible sustained VT did not differ significantly from those without inducible sustained VT. The results of these studies were compared with those of 2 control groups: 45 patients without ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction and 95 patients with spontaneous and inducible sustained VT after myocardial infarction. The signal-averaged electrocardiographic measurements in patients with spontaneous nonsustained VT after inferior infarction were intermediate between the control group without arrhythmias and the control group with sustained VT. The signal-averaged electrocardiograms in patients with nonsustained VT after anterior infarction were not significantly different from those in patients without ventricular arrhythmias. The study shows that the site of infarction influences the signal-averaged electrocardiogram in patients with VT after myocardial infarction. The signal-averaged electrocardiogram may be useful in identifying patients with nonsustained VT after a remote inferior myocardial infarction who have inducible sustained VT.\r"

In all cases the LV conduction system was fanlike and spread broadly over the left septal surface. However, the sizes and sites of the histopathologic lesions varied. In 2 cases the lesions were small and localized at the initial portion of the LV conduction system, whereas in 9 cases the lesions were located more peripherally and were more extensive, especially in 2 cases in which the lesions were mainly localized in the apical third of the LV conduction system. These differences in the sizes of lesions were believed to be due to the anatomic structure of the conduction system. At the initial portion of the LV conduction system, cells were oriented longitudinally with collagen partitions, which presumably resulted in functionally longitudinal dissociation. The variability in the lesions in these patients may explain why prognosis in terms of development of complete heart block is not always poor in patients with LAD and right bundle branch block.\r"

ECW did not differ significantly at 2, 3, or 4 h after drug administration although there was a small but significant difference between modes of administration (p = less than 0.05). With repeated oral doses the estimate of ECW was unchanged; thus, oral bromide can be used for serial determination of ECW.\r"

No differences in erythrocyte fatty acid composition were observed between women without gallstones, women with gallstones (aware and unaware of their condition), and women who had cholecystectomies. Multivariate analysis, including other diet-dependent and gallstone-related variables, showed no significant association between erythrocyte fatty acids and risk for gallstones. However, raised erythrocyte linoleic:saturated ratio was associated with increased risk for gallstones only in women with very low serum triglycerides. This latter finding needs further confirmation and is presently unexplainable. Our results suggest that dietary fatty acids do not play a major role in GD.\r"

In children older than 36 mo, wasting correlated with skin test anergy to three recall antigens and with inability to initiate hypersensitivity to dinitrochlorobenzene. In this older age group, anergy was associated with a 58% increased attack rate and an 83% increased duration of diarrheal diseases but not with febrile or respiratory infections. In stepwise regression analysis, this anergy effect was independent of the small negative impact of poorer nutritional status on morbidity. Ninety-three percent of diarrheal illnesses lasting at least 14 d were among anergic children. Cellular immune incompetence, indicated by anergy of unknown etiology, is associated with increased diarrheal morbidity and may promote the vicious cycle of repeated infections and deteriorating nutritional status.\r"

The final 80 h were spent in a whole-body indirect calorimeter. Actual metabolizable energy intake (ME) was measured by analyzing food, feces, and urine. Mean ME was 8.88 +/- 0.13 MJ/d (2123 +/- 30 kcal/d) (lean) and 10.12 +/- 0.29 MJ/d (2419 +/- 70 kcal/d) (overweight). Mean 24-h energy expenditure (24hEE) of the lean (8.58 +/- 0.13 MJ or 2052 +/- 32 kcal) was lower than that of the overweight (10.70 +/- 0.45 MJ or 2558 +/- 108 kcal; p less than 0.001) women. Energy balance was close to zero in both groups. Therefore, 24hEE was used as an estimation of energy requirement. Multiple-regression analysis showed body weight to be the best single predictor of 24hEE. Our data may be useful for prediction of energy requirements of women (aged 20-50 yr) in normal life.\r"

The Taiwanese infants experience more pronounced upward and downward changes in growth velocity than the United States (US) infants in the first 6 mo of life. In the second 6 mo, the US infants show a decline in growth velocity whereas the Taiwanese infants maintain a low and constant growth rate. Possible explanations for the different growth profile of the Taiwanese infants in the first 6 mo may be related to: catch-up growth after possible intrauterine undernutrition, genetic growth pattern of Taiwanese infants, and growth characteristics of breast-fed infants.\r"

Percent linoleic acid was similar in both races. We conclude that dietary intake of linoleic acid is similar in both races. The trend of decreasing linoleic acid with advancing age suggests that either intake of linoleic acid progressively decreases or its mobilization rate increasingly exceeds deposition rate or both. Percent palmitoleic acid (16:1) is lower (p less than 0.001) and that of stearic acid (18:0) is higher (p less than 0.001) in blacks than in whites.

Additionally, TOBEC measures were taken to predict lean body mass (LBM) changes. A total of 6.6 kg body weight was lost during the 6-wk reduction period. A decline in LBM was observed during the first 3 wk of reduction, from 47.4 to 45.7 kg, with no further LBM decline observed. Changes observed in the TOBEC phase value corresponded to the observed changes in LBM and total body water (TBW) during baseline and reduction periods. TOBEC was sensitive to small changes in LBM and TBW and may be useful for monitoring composition changes during nutritional intervention programs.\r"

Coagulation factors were within the normal range, but the high egg consumer group had significantly higher plasma fibrinogen and factor IX levels with a shorter mean prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time, possibly indicative of a slight hypercoagulable state.

Because most nonabsorbed carbohydrates are fermented yielding gas, we assessed flatulent symptoms and H2 excretion during ingestion of fructo-oligosaccharide (5 g tid) for 12 d. Ten subjects had significantly greater flatulence while taking the oligosaccharide than did five subjects taking sucrose (5 g tid). Breath H2 after 10 g fructo-oligosaccharide was similar to that of 10 g lactulose, suggesting near total malabsorption of the fructo-oligosaccharide. Although previous studies found a marked diminution in breath H2 after prolonged exposure to lactulose, breath H2 response increased by 50% after a 12-d period on the oligosaccharide and gaseous symptoms did not improve. We conclude that adaptation of colonic bacteria to carbohydrate malabsorption is variable and may depend upon quantity or nature of the carbohydrate.\r"

It was not, however, more efficient in lowering postprandial blood glucose and plasma insulin in human subjects when incorporated in a drink containing 50 g glucose. When the different gums were acidified and reneutralized to mimic conditions in the gut, there was a better correlation between viscosity and blood glucose and plasma insulin levels. This effect may explain why X/LBG was no more effective than the other gums in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia in man.\r"

Prevalence of riboflavin deficiency was significantly lower in SCD (42.5%) than in control subjects (83%) and there was less pyridoxine deficiency in SCD (10.3%) than control subjects (54.5%). Aspartate transaminase (AST) activities in SCD patients were double those in control subjects. Pyridoxine status of patients, but not of control subjects, was directly affected by riboflavin status as judged from significant correlations between EGRAC and both AST activity and ASTAC. Poor riboflavin status in patients may be restricting availability of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) due to combined effects of enhanced PLP requirements and effects of poor riboflavin status on the synthesis of PLP by pyridoxine phosphate oxidase (PPO). PPO activity was no different in the two groups.\r"

Two samples of adults, aged 18-35 yr, were drawn from separate geographic locations. LBM was determined by densitometry and TOBEC was measured with TOBEC II instrument. LBM and TOBEC were highly correlated in both samples (r = 0.96 and 0.97). Cross-validation of LBM prediction equations was accomplished by exchanging equations and comparing predicted LBM values. There was a mean difference of 0.974 kg LBM between the two equations (p less than 0.0001). Thus, data from 157 subjects were pooled and one equation was developed that incorporated height (cm), sex (males = 0, females = 1), and the zero-, first-, and second-order Fourier coefficients (FC0, FC1, and FC2) of the TOBEC phase value: LBM, kg = -36.410 + (-1.324 X sex) + (0.01185 X (FC1(0.5)xht)) + (12.347 X FC2(0.5)) + (0.0627 X FC0)-(0.9232 X FC2) This equation, developed from 157 subjects, accounted for 96% of the variability in LBM and had a standard error of estimate of 2.17 kg LBM.\r"

At 180 d postsupplementation, 74% of children who had been infected tested positive by the RDR, indicative of an inadequate liver reserve of vitamin A, in contrast to only 10% who had not been infected.

However, little comparative information is available on differences in platelet counts in the two racial groups. Therefore, this study was performed to compare platelet counts in healthy white (94), black (92), and Latin-American (63) persons. Black women had significantly higher platelet counts than did white women (P less than 0.025). Latin-American women were between the other two groups. No differences were noted among men. Black women also had a significantly higher prevalence of iron deficiency and microcytosis of RBCs than did white women. After exclusion of women with either microcytosis or iron deficiency, racial differences in platelet counts were no longer evident. The authors conclude that the differences in the platelet counts between black and white women were secondary to common RBC differences (such as iron deficiency and other causes of microcytic anemia) and were not intrinsic to the platelets. These and other factors that can affect platelet counts should be excluded before determining the reference ranges for proper interpretation of the platelet counts.\r"

Twenty-five cultures were positive from the intravascular specimen only, and 23 of these were classified as contaminated cultures. Thus, the contamination rate was significantly higher in the intravascular catheter blood culture specimens (P less than 0.001).

The most characteristic cytologic features were intact tissue fragments composed of overlapping spindle cells with nuclear distortion and ill-defined cytoplasmic borders. Smaller groups of loosely cohesive spindle-shaped cells and individual spindle cells with cytoplasm were also helpful features. In the appropriate clinical setting, these cytologic features on FNAB are felt to be diagnostic of Kaposi's sarcoma.\r"

A healing stage of vasculitis, presenting as endarteritis obliterans, was seen in patients with Sjogren's syndrome and a long-standing history of vasculitis. The hypersensitivity vasculitis was localized mainly in the skin and provided mild clinical symptoms. The polyarteritis nodosa-like vasculitis was localized predominantly in internal organs and was associated with life-threatening symptoms. Endarteritis obliterans was mainly seen in acral sites of the extremities and presented with recurrent symptoms of obstruction. One patient died of vasculitis. The remaining patients are alive. The presence of anemia, cryoglobulinemia, and hypocomplementemia suggested an immune-complex origin of the vasculitic process.\r"

Analysis of 233 healthy subjects showed that black people had significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) vitamin B12 levels than did white people. Latin-Americans had levels intermediate between those of white and black people, although their levels were significantly different only in comparison with white people (P = 0.0029).

The authors conclude that there is a racial but not a sex difference in vitamin B12 levels in the United States. Like African black people, black people and Latin-Americans in this country have significantly higher vitamin B12 levels than do white people. This finding supports the thesis that genetic factors contribute to the racial differences in vitamin B12 levels.\r"

Parameters shared by two or more criminal acts allegedly committed by the same assailant were compared with the same parameters recorded from 50 or 100 other mutually independent criminal acts committed by other known assailants. This allowed an evaluation of the probability (p) of a crime pattern expressed as a parameter score to recur in mutually independent cases. The distribution of the score, when plotted on a logarithmic scale in all examples, showed an approximately normal distribution. The relation between probability (p), the estimated mean (means), and standard deviation (SD) yielded a normal curve. Different patterns of action by different perpetrators and patterns indicating repetitive behavior could be obtained. The method is applicable during investigation of crimes in which the perpetrator acts in a repetitive manner, as in serial murders.\r"

  ".W": "Swedish legislation concerning firearms is highly restrictive. It is illegal to possess weapons (except airguns) without a license. From 1970 through 1982, there were 79 accidental firearm fatalities in Sweden. This number, corresponding to 0.074/100,000/year, is very low in comparison with similar statistics worldwide. Of these fatalities, 47 were associated with hunting and were studied carefully. Despite an increase in both the popularity of hunting and in licensing of weapons, on change in the number of accidents per year could be confirmed. Twenty-nine accidents occurred during small game hunting, of which 24 involved shotguns, and 18 occurred during moose hunting. The mean age overall was 46 years. All victims and shooters were men. Most accidents occurred before noon and during the autumn. During moose hunting, the victim most commonly was either mistaken for game or was standing beyond game. During small game hunting, the most common reason for death was improper handling of the weapon. Firing of defective weapons caused at least 10 fatal accidents. Alcohol inebriation was uncommon. It is unlikely that more restrictive firearm legislation would further decrease the number of fatal accidents. Instead, we believe that accidental firearm fatalities during hunting can be prevented by safer and more careful handling of weapons, including unloading weapons before transporting them; by replacing older weapons with more modern and safer ones; and by not allowing children to handle weapons. No shots should be fired until it is clarified that the target really is a game animal, and when hunting with rifles, the fields of fire should be clarified beforehand. Shooters at stand must be instructed not to leave their stands until explicitly told to do so.\r"

The red coloration is due to hemolysis after exudation of hemoglobin derivatives through the dentine tubules in cases in which blood has accumulated in the head, either due to congestion or by a postmortem head-down position, as after submersion in water.\r"

Pulmonary proliferative changes were present in only two cases who survived 7 and 10 days and in which artificial ventilation was utilized.\r"

The cause, although not yet clearly defined, is believed to be related to bile stasis, ischemia, bacterial infection, sepsis, the activation of factor XII, and the Shwarzman reaction. A case is described in which a 53-year-old man with pelvic fractures developed acute acalculous cholecystitis and died of multiple organ failure 3 weeks following cholecystectomy. The histopathological findings are also reported; these are most likely attributed to the Shwarzman reaction or the activation of the factor XII pathways. There has been a tendency to regard posttraumatic acute acalculous cholecystitis as induced by trauma, and calculous as mere coincidence. We believe, however, that it is not calculous but histopathological findings that determine whether acute cholecystitis following trauma was more than coincidence or just mere coincidence. Although progress in clinical care has improved the chances of survival of severely traumatized patients, posttraumatic acute cholecystitis has been increasing in frequency. We cannot be careful enough in judging the relationship of this fatal complication to the initial trauma.\r"

The diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension, particularly in forensic cases, requires that the pathologist be especially aware of the possibility and that a careful evaluation of multiple sections of lung be performed. Determination of the histopathologic type also is important because some forms of the disease may be familial and may be treatable in other family members if they are detected early.\r"

The patients were stratified in three groups: A) 18 without peripheral neuropathy (PN); B) 20 with PN but no autonomic neuropathy; C) 12 with PN and autonomic neuropathy. Twelve patients (four B, eight C) had gastrointestinal symptoms including six with dysphagia. Radionuclide esophageal emptying was abnormal in 55, 70, and 83% of patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Eleven of the 12 (92%) symptomatic and 23 of the 38 (60%) asymptomatic diabetes mellitus patients had abnormal emptying. Five of six patients with dysphagia had abnormal emptying. Esophageal manometry was also performed in 15 patients. Twelve patients had abnormal manometry. These included nutcracker esophagus in two, achalasia in one, and increased percentage of multipeaked and simultaneous contractions in nine. There were no significant correlations between radionuclide esophageal emptying, manometric changes and symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in the presence of autonomic neuropathy. Delayed esophageal emptying was more profound in the presence of PN, but abnormal esophageal emptying was present in patients with neuropathy as commonly as patients without. Furthermore, the presence of diabetic retinopathy, duration or control of diabetics, and fasting blood sugar did not influence the frequency of abnormal esophageal emptying. Our data indicate that esophageal dysfunction is common in male diabetics even in the absence of clinical PN and retinopathy, suggesting that diabetic gastroenteropathy can occur in the absence of significant diabetic complications. Commonly observed abnormal esophageal manometry in diabetics is not necessarily accompanied by significant functional disturbances or symptoms.\r"

Fifty-one patients were reviewed and perforations categorized as either acute (type I) in 16 (31%), subacute (type II) in 20 (39%), or chronic (type III) in 15 (29%). A history suggestive of chronic gallstone disease was obtained in 0% of patients with type I, in 35% of patients with type II, and 60% of patients with type III perforations. The incidence of severe systemic diseases was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) in patients with type I as compared to type III perforation. Based on these data, clinical profiles have been developed for patients at risk of developing acute versus chronic gallbladder perforation. Awareness of these groupings forms the basis for early recognition and treatment of acute gallbladder perforation.\r"

Two of them with normal motility of the orifice showed normal pressures in the cele. However, one case with spastic motility of the orifice showed high pressure in the cele. All five cases had chronic pancreatitis. In a case (type E) without communication between the cele and the pancreatic duct, the cause of pancreatitis seemed to be increased pancreatic ductal pressure due to disturbed motility of an inflamed pancreatic sphincter. In the other four cases with communication between the cele and the pancreatic duct, the cause of pancreatitis may be a reflux of bile juice into the pancreatic duct. Manometric study seems to be useful in clarifying the pathophysiology of choledochocele.\r"

Main clinical symptoms and signs were edema, proteinuria, hypertension, and abnormal studies of electrocardiogram. His renal disease had been relatively well controlled by administration of corticosteroids, but he died suddenly on March 12, 1986. Autopsy revealed fresh and old myocardial infarct and membranous glomerulonephritis. The liver weighed 1530 g and showed a diffuse nodular configuration except for in the area of Zahn's red infarct. Fibrosis was minimal in most areas, and each nodule was circumscribed by compressed atrophic parenchyma. However, this case was unusual compared to most cases of nodular regenerative hyperplasia because there was prominent fibrosis in the perihilar portion. Paucity of interlobular arterial branches was confirmed by a crude morphometry. We describe herein this somewhat unusual nodular regenerative hyperplasia case with some discussion concerning the histogenesis.\r"

One ileostomate volunteer tested in metabolic feeding trials a total of 20 starchy foods (nine of which were repeated on two to seven occasions, mean 3.5 +/- 1.7). This ileostomate volunteer exhibited macronutrient and fiber losses that were within 97.3 +/- 6.6% of the mean, for a range of foods eaten by three other ileostomates and was therefore believed to be representative. Measurement of available carbohydrate in ileal effluent demonstrated a wide range of recoveries from 2.7 to 18% from different starchy foods. The available carbohydrate losses related to the fiber content (r = 0.885, p less than 0.001), in vitro digestibility of the food (r = -0.867, p less than 0.01), and their glycemic responses (r = -0.611, p less than 0.05). Our data support the concept that available carbohydrate losses to the colon may be greater in many foods than the carbohydrate entering the colon as dietary fiber. The food factors responsible are diverse and the possible metabolic consequences of carbohydrate malabsorption may be broad.\r"

  ".W": "Many previous investigations of available amylase inhibitors have not been able to demonstrate significant carbohydrate malabsorption. This study uses breath hydrogen analysis, a sensitive method for detecting the passage of starch into the colon, to determine if a potent amylase inhibitor is capable of producing carbohydrate malabsorption. Thirteen volunteers underwent three studies, ingesting as a carbohydrate substrate: lactulose 20 g, spaghetti alone, and spaghetti with amylase inhibitor (3.8 g). Samples of breath were collected (at frequent intervals) for 2 h after the lactulose and for 8 h after the spaghetti meal and analyzed for hydrogen concentration. The ingestion of spaghetti alone resulted in significant increases in breath hydrogen concentration at 420-450 min. The mean (+/- SE) hydrogen excretion rate was increased more than 2-fold with the amylase inhibitor, from 0.4 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 ml/h (p less than 0.05). Use of the amylase inhibitor in powder form produced a similar increase in the rate of hydrogen excretion to 1.1 +/- 0.4 ml/h. The percentage of carbohydrate malabsorbed was calculated for the spaghetti meal and spaghetti with amylase inhibitor using each individual's observed hydrogen excretion with lactulose. Over the 8-h observation period, 4.7 +/- 1.9% of the spaghetti was malabsorbed and 7.0 +/- 1.4% of the spaghetti with amylase inhibitor was malabsorbed (p less than 0.05). Measurements of the effect of the amylase inhibitor on amylase activity of duodenal juice revealed that the amylase inhibitor at a concentration of more than 5 mg/ml decreased the amylase activity by more than 96%. These results indicate that this potent amylase inhibitor is capable of enhancing malabsorption of wheat starch.\r"

Gastric aspiration for 1 h suppressed the high concentrations of secretin by 46% and somatostatin by 27%. The intravenous infusion of glucose reduced the plasma secretin even further by 88%; the decrease in somatostatin was not statistically significant. The study shows that gastric aspiration and/or glucose infusion suppressed the high plasma concentration of secretin and that factors other than hyperchlorhydria must be involved in the hypersecretinemia seen during starvation. The elevated plasma somatostatin concentration seen during starvation may be a consequence of increased acid secretion.\r"

We asked the question of \"how much is enough?\" by statistically comparing five sets of 10 wet swallows (5 ml) each separated by 20 min in eight volunteers using constant infusion manometry. Peristaltic waves were evaluated for amplitude, duration, and velocity using an on-line computer program. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls test for uniformity among sets of swallows. The sets of 10 swallows showed no evidence of a training effect over time. Less than 5% of all comparisons (Newman-Keuls) showed significant differences. Using 5% variability outside of 1 SD as a cutoff (95% confidence interval) amplitude of normal wet swallows could be adequately defined by more than or equal to five swallows and velocity by more than or equal to seven swallows. Duration shows the greatest overall variability and required more than or equal to eight swallows for accurate assessment. These data suggest that at least five to eight wet swallows should be performed to describe \"typical\" manometry parameters for normal subjects.\r"

Retrosternal pain, odynophagia, and dysphagia were the most commonly reported symptoms and most cases were self-limited with 7 to 10 days of symptomatic therapy. Occasionally, severe odynophagia or dysphagia necessitated hospitalization. Emepronium bromide, tetracycline, and its derivatives, potassium chloride, and quinidine accounted for 89% of the reported cases; the remaining 11% were caused by 14 other medications. Serious sequelae, including death, have been linked to potassium-induced esophageal injury. With other medications, however, serious complications were rare. The diagnostic study of choice for suspected medication-induced esophageal injury is endoscopy, although air contrast barium swallow may often detect subtle mucosal abnormalities. In uncomplicated cases the history alone may be sufficient to make the diagnosis. Concurrent ingestion of adequate amounts of fluid and avoidance of unnecessary bedtime medications may help to prevent medication-induced esophageal injury.\r"

Cardiac tamponade occurred during 27 episodes, while pretamponade occurred in 30. Tamponade was less frequent and resolution of pericarditis without invasive intervention more frequent when pericarditis occurred within 2 weeks of initiation of chronic dialysis. Similarly, resolution with conservative therapy was more frequent with first episodes than with recurrences, and when pericarditis occurred within 3 months of initiation of chronic dialysis. The overall survival was 89.7% and was the same irrespective of the duration of dialysis or whether the pericarditis was a first episode or a recurrence. We recommend that patients with pericarditis and no hemodynamic alterations receive intensive hemodialysis, with careful hemodynamic and echocardiographic monitoring, as primary treatment. Invasive intervention is indicated if cardiac tamponade or pretamponade develops, if a pericardial effusion increases progressively in size, or if a large effusion persists after ten to 14 days of intensive dialysis. In our experience, the invasive intervention of choice is either formal pericardiectomy or subxiphoid pericardiotomy with intrapericardial steroid instillation. In our experience, pericardiocentesis has proven to be a high-risk procedure. It is reserved for emergency circumstances, and then is preferably performed in the operating room just prior to induction of anesthesia for definitive surgical drainage.\r"

  ".W": "The relevance of routine physical examinations, laboratory tests, and x-rays in guiding therapeutic decisions was investigated in 54 patients on hemodialysis. Patients were observed for 1 year, while recording all therapeutic interventions and tracing the procedures that had determined them. In no case did a variation in treatment follow the routine physical examination of a patient who was not symptomatic or already signaled for BP or dialytic problems by the hemodialysis nurses. A number of major therapeutic interventions were conversely necessary for acute illnesses that could not be foreseen during the routine physician-patient encounter. Of the many laboratory tests, only the determination of complete blood cell count, serum electrolytes, and calcium and phosphorus levels were frequently associated with therapeutic decisions. No intervention was directly related with x-ray bone examination. On the whole, a subgroup of 11 \"high-risk\" patients who required frequent and multiple therapeutic interventions was identified, the remaining 43 needing only rare and minor adjustments. It is concluded that routine physical examinations are probably useless in identifying and treating intercurrent problems of patients with chronic end-stage renal failure and that only very few hematochemical laboratory tests should be regularly performed. On the basis of a benefit/risk and benefit/cost examination, it is suggested that personally tailored follow-up schemes would probably be a more appropriate way of monitoring patients on maintenance hemodialysis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of end-stage renal failure and the dialytic process on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is largely unknown. We prospectively studied 60 stable patients with end-stage renal disease to determine the prevalence of elevated ESR in this population. ESRs were also measured immediately pre- and postdialysis in 48 hemodialysis patients. ESR was found to be elevated (greater than or equal to 25 mm/h, Westergren method) in 93% of patients with end-stage renal failure. Fifty-seven percent of patients had marked elevation of ESR (greater than 60 mm/h), while 20% had extreme increases in ESR (greater than or equal to 100 mm/h). In a linear models analysis, aging (P less than .02), anemia (P less than .01), and hypocalcemia (P less than .0001) correlated significantly with ESR elevation. Midweek BUN and creatinine, type and duration of dialysis, cause of renal failure, and serum albumin and total protein measurements did not correlate with ESR. In 48 stable in-center hemodialysis patients, mean predialysis ESR of 70 +/- 4 mm/h was not significantly different from mean postdialysis ESR of 72 +/- 5 mm/h. Retrospective chart review of available ESRs prior to initiation of any dialysis treatment also revealed significant elevation of ESR, mean 82 +/- 9 mm/h, in patients with renal disease not yet on dialysis. An upward trend in ESR during acute illness (74 +/- 9 to 95 +/- 8, N = 10) was observed. In a subpopulation of patients, fibrinogen correlated significantly with ESR while gamma-globulins did not. We conclude that measurement of ESR in end-stage renal failure has little clinical utility. Possible explanations for acceleration of ESR in this population are discussed.\r"

In these patients, removal of the Tenckhoff catheter is necessary to achieve a cure. Sequestration of bacteria within fibrin clots located on the catheter has been postulated to contribute to this resistance to standard therapy. We, therefore, examined the efficacy of intraperitoneal streptokinase in combination with antibiotic therapy in the treatment of two patients with recurrent bacterial peritonitis. After addition of streptokinase to the therapeutic regimen, no further episodes of peritonitis were observed after 6 to 8 weeks follow-up. These data suggest that intraperitoneal streptokinase may be useful as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of recurrent bacterial peritonitis.\r"

The subset of hypertensives sensitive to salt and having normal or high renin levels are termed nonmodulators. These are patients with essential hypertension who fail to modulate their renal blood flow and aldosterone responsiveness to angiotensin II when dietary sodium is changed. The result of nonmodulation is a pressor response to a short-term sodium load that results from a failure to excrete the sodium appropriately and that is presumably secondary to the defect in renal blood supply. On a high sodium load only nonmodulators have a decrease in BP in response to short-term treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which indicates an abnormality in intrarenal angiotensin II levels or in the renal angiotensin II receptor.\r"

In protocol I, rats were subjected to 5/6 renal ablation and received no therapy, enalapril (CEI), or triple-drug therapy (TRX) for 12 weeks. Control of systemic and glomerular hypertension with CEI resulted in prevention of glomerular capillary hypertension and protection against glomerular injury. Despite equivalent control of systemic BP, failure of TRX to control glomerular hypertension was associated with no protection against eventual proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, values for these indexes being as abnormal as in rats receiving no therapy. In protocol II, rats were again subjected to 5/6 renal ablation and followed for 18 weeks. Early institution of CEI soon after ablation again prevented systemic and glomerular hypertension and largely limited glomerular injury. In a third group, enalapril therapy was delayed for 8 weeks after ablation until hypertension and proteinuria were established. Late institution of CEI resulted in prompt reduction in systemic and glomerular capillary hypertension and stabilization of glomerular disease. In protocol III, CEI was administered to normotensive, moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats. A modest, 20-mm Hg reduction in systemic arterial pressure was associated with the normalization of glomerular capillary pressure and a striking reduction in the development of albuminuria and glomerular injury. These studies suggest that CEI effectively prevent glomerular capillary hypertension and thereby afford protection against glomerular injury in diverse models of progressive renal disease.\r"

Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 patients (11) had dialysate leaks leading to abdominal-wall edema, genital edema, or exit-site drainage. Scintigrams were abnormal in nine patients in this group and frequently provided localizing information that aided in the management of leaks. Group 2 patients (five) had recurrent peritonitis. Two of these patients had abnormal scintigrams. In one instance, scintigraphy detected multiple abdominal-wall hernias that may have been responsible for recurrent peritonitis, which resolved following corrective surgery. Group 3 patients (two) had inadequate ultrafiltration but no clinical evidence of a dialysate leak. Scintigrams were negative in this group, eliminating consideration of an underlying structural defect in the peritoneum. Scintigraphic imaging is possible for several hours following instillation of labeled dialysate. This capability is important, since scintigrams that were initially negative frequently became positive after several hours of ambulation. Postdrainage images were also helpful in confirming extraperitoneal leakage. This study demonstrates that peritoneal scintigraphy is a useful diagnostic tool in the management of complications of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.\r"

On presentation, the patient had a normal anion-gap type of metabolic acidosis; the cause of the acidosis was gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss. Since the urine pH was 6.0 when the patient was acidemic, distal renal tubular acidosis was also suspected. However, since the kidneys generated more than 190 mmol of bicarbonate per day (urine ammonium was 190 mmol/d), reduced renal acid excretion was not the cause of the acidosis. Therefore, the urine pH of 6.0 provided a false clue with respect to a renal cause for the acidosis in this setting; in contrast, the urine anion gap provides more reliable information concerning bicarbonate generation by the kidney.\r"

In addition, there is a clinical impression that uremic patients are also more thermolabile than healthy people; that is, in a warm environment, body temperature tends to be higher, and in a cold environment, body temperature tends to be lower than in healthy subjects. To test the hypothesis that uremia results in enhanced thermolability, nonoperated control (NO), nephrectomized (NX), and sham-nephrectomized (SHAM) rabbits were subjected to mild cold (5 degrees C) and heat (30 degrees C) stresses. At 48 hours postsurgery, the core temperature of NX rabbits was significantly lower than that of the NO or SHAM rabbits (P less than .01). Exposure to 5 degrees C resulted in a significant fall in body temperature of the NX (from 39.1 degrees C to 38.3 degrees C; P less than .05) rabbits compared to the NO rabbits. There was a tendency for body temperature of the SHAM rabbits to fall, and as a result, there was no significant difference in the change in body temperature between the SHAM and NX rabbits. Exposure to 30 degrees C resulted in virtually no change in the core temperature of the NO or SHAM rabbits, but did result in a significant rise in core temperature of the NX rabbits (P less than .02 and P less than .01 for respective comparisons), as well as a significant increase in mortality rate (P less than .02). Based on these data, we conclude that anephric animals are more thermolabile, and are less able to tolerate exposure to a warm environment, than are normal animals.\r"

The estimates have been made directly, with data from 22,043 Jewish and 32,342 non-Jewish individuals measured for total serum hexosaminidase activity and the heat-labile fraction. These values have been shown to identify potential carriers of the Sandhoff allele(s) with 95% sensitivity. Subsequent leukocyte assays of total hexosaminidase activity and the heat-labile fraction in those identified in serum tests have been shown to provide a much finer discrimination between those who carry the allele(s) and those who do not. Results from such assays were used to generate these carrier frequency estimates. Carrier frequency estimates have also been made indirectly from Sandhoff disease incidence data collected during the period 1979-84. These estimates are in agreement with data for the Jewish population under analysis, but in the non-Jewish population the estimate derived from data on screened individuals is greater than the estimate derived from incidence figures. The possible causes for such a difference are discussed. In a study of non-Jewish individuals each of whose grandparents derives from a single country of origin, the distribution of countries among Sandhoff disease carriers differs significantly from that in the non-Jewish sample under analysis, indicating possible ethnic groups with increased or decreased carrier frequencies. These analyses suggest an increased Sandhoff disease carrier frequency among Mexican and Central-American populations and a decreased carrier frequency among non-Jewish German populations.\r"

At a minimum, 48 of these patients were related to at least one other patient. On the basis of presence or absence of established kinships, the patients were divided into three groups. Twenty-nine patients in group 1 belonged to one large pedigree. Their birthplaces and those of their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents clustered in the extreme eastern portion of the state. Seventeen other patients, group 2, were related to at least one other patient but not to a patient in group 1. Their birthplaces and those of their ancestors did not show significant clustering. With the exception of two siblings, the 34 patients of group 3 had no family members with IgA nephropathy. The birthplaces for these patients and ancestors were widely scattered. These data suggest that one or more genetically determined factors are important in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy in some patients. A founder effect, whereby a gene(s) conveying susceptibility to IgA nephropathy was carried into eastern Kentucky by one or more of the early settlers, would explain the geographic clustering of the birthplaces of the patients in group 1 and their ancestors. The characteristic immunopathology of IgA nephropathy may represent the histologic result of separate disease processes, one or more of which could be genetically influenced.\r"

Segregation analysis showed that the mixed model of recessive inheritance of high levels was most appropriate for these data--with approximately 36% of the total phenotypic variation in log[IgE] attributable to genetic factors, equally divided between a Mendelian component and a more general polygenic component. Thus, these data suggest some role for Mendelian control of basal IgE levels, but there is significant familial aggregation in IgE levels over and above that due to a Mendelian factor.\r"

  ".W": "Stevens suggests a test of fit, based on Bernstein's estimators, of the Hardy-Weinberg law for the ABO system. Nam and Gart extend this test to the generalized ABO-like system and apply it to HLA data. When the recessive gene is rare, Huether and Murphy recall Haldane's point that its Bernstein's estimator is negatively biased and go on to suggest novel corrected versions of it. With the identification of more HLA antigens, it is not uncommon to find, in certain populations, that the sample data contain no double blanks; that is, every individual reacts to at least one antigen for a given locus. Gart and Nam give a simple score test of a zero true recessive-gene frequency for such situations. Here we examine the extended test of Stevens as a test of this hypothesis. We find that it is fully efficient for two codominant alleles but that when the number exceeds two its efficiency may be 50% or lower or as high as 100%, depending on the number of alleles and the pattern of gene frequencies. The tests are applied to a set of HLA data.\r"

The study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction in the two settings. Fifty-five patients in eight rural hospitals and 36 patients in the urban tertiary care center received intravenous streptokinase. Of the 87 patients whose symptoms first occurred out of the hospital, 63 percent were treated within three hours. There were no significant differences in rates of clinically determined coronary artery recanalization (63 percent versus 69 percent for rural and tertiary hospitals, respectively), in-hospital mortality (5.4 percent versus 11 percent), bleeding complications (3.6 percent versus 5.5 percent), or time from the onset of pain to infusion of streptokinase (3.4 hours versus 2.9 hours). There were also no differences in the completeness of collection of serial coagulation data and cardiac enzyme values, or in the documentation of chest pain onset and cessation. Major differences between rural centers and the tertiary care center involved the use of serial electrocardiography (58 percent versus 89 percent, respectively), subsequent cardiac catheterization (49 percent versus 86 percent), and the timing of catheterization, when performed (30.4 days versus 4.6 days) (p less than 0.005 for all values). Thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction can be administered quickly, safely, and effectively in rural hospital settings even by physicians previously unfamiliar with this form of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship of steady-state serum levels of amiodarone and its major metabolite, desethylamiodarone, to therapeutic and toxic effects was evaluated in 111 patients treated for supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. All patients were treated for more than two months (mean 10 +/- 7), and repeated serum levels determined at least two months apart were within 0.5 mg/liter of each other. Effective control of arrhythmias during steady-state therapy was achieved in 91 patients (82 percent of the study populations); recurrent arrhythmias or sudden death did not correlate with levels. An adverse drug effect necessitating cessation of therapy and/or concomitant medical therapy for the adverse effect occurred in 12 patients (11 percent); an additional 33 patients (30 percent) had an adverse effect that did not require change in therapy. The mean serum concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone associated with adverse drug effects were higher (2.6 +/- 1.2 mg/liter and 2.0 +/- 0.8 mg/liter) than those in patients without adverse effects (2.1 +/- 1.0 mg/liter and 1.5 +/- 0.7 mg/liter), p less than 0.05. An amiodarone serum concentration of 2.5 mg/liter or more had a positive predictive value of 76 percent for identifying patients with an adverse effect. The level of desethyl metabolite of amiodarone correlated directly with the serum amiodarone concentration (r = 0.82). Measurement of desethylamiodarone did not increase the sensitivity or specificity of the amiodarone level alone in the identification of patients at risk for adverse drug effects.\r"

  ".W": "To impact on the development of clinical congestive heart failure as a complication of doxorubicin therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction was monitored with serial resting radionuclide angiocardiography in 1,487 patients with cancer over a seven-year period in both university and community hospital environments. A high-risk subset of 282 patients was selected for retrospective analysis of their clinical outcome. High-risk patients were identified by one or two of the following three criteria: decline of 10 percent or more in absolute left ventricular ejection fraction from a normal baseline to 50 percent or less; high cumulative dose of doxorubicin (more than 450 mg/m2); abnormal baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 50 percent). Clinical congestive heart failure occurred in 46 (16 percent) during the treatment period, and in an additional three patients (1.3 percent) at last follow-up examination 11.8 +/- 14.2 months following discontinuation of doxorubicin. Total cumulative dosages of doxorubicin that precipitated congestive heart failure (75 to 1,095 mg/m2) and those that did not (30 to 880 mg/m2) varied widely. Decline of 10 percent or more in absolute left ventricular ejection fraction to a value of 50 percent or less preceded administration of the final dose of doxorubicin that precipitated clinical congestive heart failure in the majority of patients in whom congestive heart failure developed. Clinical congestive heart failure improved in 87 percent given routine therapy with digitalis, diuretics, and/or vasodilators. Criteria for monitoring left ventricular ejection fraction and discontinuing doxorubicin were formulated. The occurrence of clinical congestive heart failure was compared in those patients whose management was concordant with proposed criteria (Group A) and in those whose management was not (Group B). Group A had a lower incidence of congestive heart failure compared with Group B (2.9 percent versus 20.8 percent, p less than 0.001) and had only mild congestive heart failure that resolved with treatment (n = 2) and no deaths due to congestive heart failure. Multivariate analysis with proportional-hazards regression (Cox's model) demonstrated a fourfold reduction in the incidence of congestive heart failure independent of other clinical predictor variables in those patients whose management was concordant with proposed guideline criteria. The incidence, persistence, late development, predictability, and reversibility of clinical congestive heart failure were comparable in university and community hospital settings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of low nocturnal blood glucose values (i.e., less than 65 mg/dl) was assessed in 20 insulin-dependent diabetic patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion supported by capillary blood glucose monitoring before each meal and the evening snack. Patients were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group. Both groups followed an identical protocol for the first part of the study (baseline). Patients were instructed to determine capillary blood glucose measurements five times during the night for three consecutive nights. The same procedure was repeated one week later, but this time the subjects in the experimental group were instructed to have an extra snack if capillary blood glucose levels at 10:30 P.M. were 120 mg/dl or less. The control group continued with the usual routine of one evening snack at 9 P.M. At baseline, the incidence of capillary blood glucose values of less than 65 mg/dl was 13 percent. The ingestion of an extra snack at bedtime resulted in the absence of capillary blood glucose values of less than 65 mg/dl in the experimental group, whereas the incidence of capillary blood glucose values of less than 65 mg/dl in the control group remained 13 percent (p = 0.038). The capillary blood glucose concentration at 10:30 P.M. was highly predictive of the risk of nocturnal blood glucose values below 65 mg/dl (p = 0.015) and fasting capillary blood glucose values above 140 mg/dl (p = 0.0001). These data show that nocturnal hypoglycemia may be a considerable problem during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy even if the basal infusion rate is adjusted in the hospital on the basis of nocturnal blood glucose concentrations. The ingestion of an extra snack at bedtime for capillary blood glucose values below 120 mg/dl has the potential to minimize this risk. The capillary blood glucose concentration at 10:30 P.M. is a significant predictor of nocturnal hypoglycemia.\r"

Seventeen patients with biopsy-proved breast cancer and hypercalcemia were identified in a prospective, unselected manner. Biochemical and clinical evaluation included measurements of parathyroid hormone, nephrogenous cAMP, vitamin D metabolites, fasting calcium excretion, and maximal tubular phosphate reabsorption, and bone radionuclide scanning. Tumor histologic findings were also reviewed. Four of the 17 patients (23.5 percent) had no evidence of bone involvement by bone scanning or radiography. Two additional patients (a total of 35 percent) appeared to have a humoral component to their hypercalcemia as determined by the presence of elevated nephrogenous cAMP excretion. These observations suggest that humoral, tumor-derived products may play a more important role in the hypercalcemia of breast cancer than has been previously recognized.\r"

All patients were enrolled at the initiation of dialysis, and age, sex, cause of renal failure, prior treatment of renal osteodystrophy, and baseline serum and bone histologic variables were similar in the two groups. After initial blood samples and bone biopsy specimens (with double-tetracycline labels) were obtained, renal osteodystrophy in both groups received comparable treatment with aluminum hydroxide to maintain serum phosphorus levels between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dl, and with calcium carbonate and calcitriol to maintain total serum calcium levels between 10 and 11 mg/dl. Blood and bone samples were obtained again after nine months. All patients were asymptomatic at the beginning and end of the study. Phosphorus values were well controlled, and total calcium increased similarly in both groups. Although ionized calcium levels increased in both groups, the final level was higher in hemodialysis-treated patients than in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (2.82 +/- 0.07 meq/liter and 2.5 +/- 0.05 meq/liter, respectively; p = 0.005). Amino-terminal parathyroid hormone levels normalized in both groups, and histologic improvement of osteitis fibrosa occurred in a similar proportion of patients in both groups; however, quantitative improvement was greater in the hemodialysis-treated patients. Osteomalacia, assessed qualitatively and by dynamic histomorphometric measurements, was ameliorated to a much greater degree in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis-treated patients. Bone aluminum staining was absent in all biopsy specimens. Overall, bone histologic findings improved to a greater degree in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. When patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis and receiving similar treatment for renal osteodystrophy were compared, patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis appeared to have a greater improvement in their metabolic bone disease.\r"

Bone density was measured in 28 white premenopausal female patients who were taking commonly prescribed suppressive doses of L-thyroxine (mean dose 0.171 +/- 0.035 g) for five or more years. The thyroxine level was 13.5 +/- 2.6 micrograms/dl (normal 8.0 +/- 2.4 micrograms/dl), the free thyroxine index was 4.4 +/- 1.0 (normal 2.4 +/- 0.8), and the triiodothyronine value was 154 +/- 26 ng/dl (normal 132 +/- 32 ng/dl). Basal thyrotropin was undetectable (less than 0.08 microIU/ml) in 23 patients, and thyrotropin measured 20 minutes after thyrotropin-releasing hormone administration was not demonstrable in 13 patients and subnormal in 10 patients. Women who had taken L-thyroxine for 10 or more years (n = 12, age 37 +/- 4 years) had a 9 percent reduction in bone density (0.667 +/- 0.044 g/cm2, p less than 0.01) compared with normal premenopausal age-matched control subjects (n = 56, age 35 +/- 6 years, bone density 0.733 +/- 0.055 g/cm2). It is concluded that prolonged suppressive L-thyroxine treatment may result in mild subclinical hyperthyroidism with adverse effects on bone. Patients requiring suppression of the pituitary-thyroid axis should be given the smallest dose of L-thyroxine necessary to achieve a satisfactory clinical response.\r"

It is proposed that a thrombogenic stimulus such as stasis, altered hormonal milieu, or failure of hepatic clearance of activated coagulants results in consumption of protein C and antithrombin III, predisposing to splanchnic venous occlusion. This further impairs hepatic function, prevents restitution of protein C and antithrombin levels, and promotes continuing venous thrombosis. Thus, a vicious cycle of thrombosis and hepatic damage is perpetuated.\r"

In patients without meningitis, 55 percent of the cerebrospinal fluid specimens had more white blood cells than could be attributed to trauma. However, in only 10 percent was the actual white blood cell count more than 10 times greater than the number referable to trauma. In 38 percent, there were fewer white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid than the ratio predicted. Such underestimation was uncommon among patients with culture-positive meningitis: the ratio failed to detect leukocytosis in only 10 percent, and all but one of these patients had clinical reasons for the low cerebrospinal fluid count. It is concluded that true leukocytosis is rarely masked in blood-contaminated cerebrospinal fluid, and that the presence of more than 10 times the number of white blood cells than allowed by the adjustment is a sensitive and specific indicator of meningitis. However, a simple mechanical use of the formula is not justified, and all available clinical and laboratory data should be used when deciding whether to institute treatment in a patient with possible meningitis and bloody spinal fluid.\r"

Fifty-three patients with AL amyloidosis seen between 1976 and 1983 were treated with colchicine, and their clinical course and survival were compared with that in 29 other patients seen between 1961 and 1973. Of the variables measured, the treatment, the patient's sex, and the time interval from diagnosis to referral of treatment were significantly associated with length of survival. Median survival for the colchicine-treated patients was 17 months, compared with six months for the non-colchicine-treated patients. A surprising finding was the longer life span in female patients (median eight months versus four and a half months in the non-colchicine-treated group, and 25.5 months versus 10 month in the colchicine-treated group). The study suggests that colchicine has improved the life expectancy in AL amyloidosis. Although it is not a specific therapy, it may be a reasonable form of adjunctive treatment in this complex disorder.\r"

P. putida was isolated from the site of insertion and the tip of the catheter in one of these three patients. Following therapy, all patients had a rapid recovery from their infection.

Four patients who presented with \"purple toes syndrome\" several weeks after warfarin therapy was initiated are described. The diagnosis of cholesterol microembolization was made by biopsy in three cases. Malignant hypertension and renal failure developed in two patients who died within three to six months of onset of purple toes. Postmortem examination in one of these patients showed widespread cholesterol microembolization. Renal failure has not developed in the other two patients, who are doing well. These biopsy and autopsy results suggest that the warfarin-related \"purple toes syndrome\" is due to cholesterol microembolization.\r"

Carotid sinus syncope unrelated to cancer is usually caused by bradycardia and responds to control of the heart rate. When neoplastic disease involves the carotid sinus, vasodepressor hypotension, with or without bradycardia, is more common. Control of the heart rate alone is not effective. Although this syndrome is not common, it is probably not recognized in milder forms. Most patients in whom this syndrome develops have cancer of the head and neck. A patient with breast carcinoma metastatic to the neck and carotid sinus is described in whom syncope with hypotension and bradycardia developed. Although a temporary cardiac pacemaker controlled bradycardia, severe hypotensive episodes recurred despite treatment with anticholinergic and sympathomimetic drugs. The pathophysiology and therapy of this syndrome in patients with cancer are reviewed.\r"

Whether administered for moderate or protracted periods, norfloxacin has been relatively safe in animals over a wide range of doses. There has been no evidence of a teratogenic effect in any of the animal species tested (rat, rabbit, mouse, monkey) at six to 50 times the human dose (400 mg twice daily). However, norfloxacin has been shown to produce embryonic loss in monkeys when given in doses 10 times the maximal human dose, resulting in peak plasma levels that are two to three times those obtained in humans. Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, norfloxacin is not recommended for use in this population because it, like other drugs in this class, causes arthropathy in immature animals. In animals, norfloxacin is neither mutagenic nor carcinogenic, and, in clinical trials, norfloxacin-related adverse experiences have been uncommon. Those that have occurred have been generally mild, requiring discontinuation of therapy in less than 1 percent of patients. The most frequently reported side effects have been nausea, dyspepsia, headache, and dizziness. Administration of 400 mg of norfloxacin at two or three times a day has been associated with reasonably good gastrointestinal tolerance.\r"

During pregnancy, it causes pyelonephritis and low-birth-weight deliveries, both of which can be reduced in frequency by treatment of the bacteriuria. This asymptomatic infection is also associated with an increased risk of perinatal fetal death; no beneficial effect of therapy has been observed for this condition, however. Asymptomatic UTI has been associated with excess mortality in adult women in a general community setting and in adults of both sexes in a nursing home. To date, there has been no adequate test of treatment of asymptomatic UTI in these groups. UTIs that result from short-term, indwelling bladder catheterization in acute-care hospitals are also associated with a marked increase (relative odds equal to 2.8) in the risk of dying during the hospitalization. A randomized trial of preventive measures that reduced the risk of catheter-associated UTI demonstrated a decrease in mortality commensurate with the lesser risk of infection. These data suggest that asymptomatic UTI may increase the risk of death under certain circumstances. Additional studies are indicated to confirm the phenomenon, to identify high-risk persons, and to determine whether prevention and/or treatment of asymptomatic UTI reduces these effects.\r"

This report is an analysis of 61 \"compassionate\" requests for norfloxacin that resulted in 42 treatment courses. The reasons for use included multiresistant pathogens susceptible only to norfloxacin in 42 percent, failure of prior use of a marketed antibiotic in 34 percent, and preferred use of norfloxacin due to anticipated toxicity from an aminoglycoside in 32 percent or from other agents in 9 percent. Infections treated included 29 complicated urinary tract infections, 23 involving multiresistant Pseudomonas species, and 10 gastrointestinal infections, seven involving Salmonella species. Prophylaxis of infection was initiated in three neutropenic patients with leukemia. The duration of norfloxacin therapy ranged from eight to 28 days at a daily dose of 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Norfloxacin treatment resulted in clinical cure or improvement in 84 percent of patients and eradicated the etiologic pathogen(s) 52 percent of the time. In Pseudomonas species infections, cure was achieved in 29 percent of patients and 57 percent showed improvement; the pathogen was eradicated in 43 percent of these infections. Resistance developed in four of the eight Pseudomonas species infections that persisted. Based on a review of compassionate therapy cases, it appears that norfloxacin is effective oral therapy for many complicated urinary and gastrointestinal infections for which other agents cannot be used because of bacterial resistance or anticipated toxicity.\r"

Thirty-seven malignancies were detected in 29 cyclophosphamide-treated patients, while 16 malignancies were found in 16 control patients (p less than 0.05) during a mean follow-up period of more than 11 years. Urinary bladder cancer (six cyclophosphamide-treated patients, no control patients) and skin cancer (eight cyclophosphamide-treated patients, no control patients) were identified as differing statistically between the groups, and hematologic malignancy (five cyclophosphamide-treated patients, one control patient) showed a similar trend. Survival analysis indicated that the rate of development of malignancy in the cyclophosphamide-treated patients was significantly greater than in the control patients at six years following drug initiation, and that this increased rate persisted even at 13 years (p less than 0.01). Of the many risk factors evaluated, mean total cyclophosphamide dose and duration and tobacco use were significantly increased in patients in whom cancer subsequently developed. These long-term complications must be considered seriously when cyclophosphamide or other cytotoxic drugs are initiated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

This study assessed whether an inexpensive reminder system of preventive care checklists would improve physician implementation of periodic health measures. Residents in internal medicine were randomly placed into two groups: one received a copy of the appropriate checklist with each patient's medical record; the other did not. After one year, 200 randomly selected records were audited to determine the proportion of recommendations implemented for each patient. Residents who received checklists performed appropriate preventive health measures at a significantly higher rate than those who did not (0.56 +/- 0.26 versus 0.39 +/- 0.22, p less than 0.002). The actual use of the checklist to record the results was associated with an even higher rate of compliance compared with instances in which the checklists were provided but not used and instances in which checklists were not received (0.70 +/- 0.21 versus 0.44 +/- 0.24 and 0.39 +/- 0.22, respectively, p less than 0.002). These data suggest that a physician's use of simple checklists can provide an inexpensive and effective means of improving implementation of periodic health maintenance.\r"

A unique feature of this case was the presence of a false-positive latex agglutination result for cryptococcal antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of pleocytosis. Additional laboratory studies, which included indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, however, failed to reveal common antigenic surface components between these organisms.\r"

The patient also had generalized peripheral lymphadenopathy with lymph node biopsy showing PAS-negative noncaseating granulomas. Electron microscopic examination of the lymph node specimen demonstrated a small number of typical bacilliform bodies with localization specifically to the granulomas in the lymph node. This finding of bacilliform bodies within PAS-negative noncaseating granulomas has not been reported previously. Localization of the Whipple bacillus specifically to noncaseating granulomas suggests that some patients with the disease may manifest a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the bacillus.\r"

Because evaluation methods substantially influence education, poor performance can be improved with better clinical evaluation methods. This study evaluated a standardized method to measure clinical performance in which trained actual and simulated patients were organized in a multiple-station format for efficient testing of examinees on 17 cases in less than four hours. Specific checklists completed by patients and predetermined scoring protocols yielded reliable data and reduced faculty time. Data from 204 students in three clerkships were consistent with previous research showing case specificity and substantial case-to-case variability. As a group however, the students' overall total scores were very similar. This suggests that clinical education is inconsistent and that a profile of an examinee's performance is more accurate than a single overall score. Validity of this standardized clinical examination was supported by significant but moderate correlations with faculty ratings of ward performance and the medicine subtest of the National Board of Medical Examiners test, part II. Direct per-student costs were $21.00. This standardized objective examination of clinical skills is feasible for use in training programs and will provide reliable and valid data on clinical performance not available through typical methods.\r"

  ".W": "Hemofiltration has been suggested as a new therapeutic tool in refractory heart failure. In this study, 11 patients with primary or ischemic heart disease in New York Heart Association class IV, in whom there was no response to medical treatment, were subjected to hemofiltration. The pathophysiologic adjustments promoted by subtraction of plasma water were investigated, and guidelines for an appropriate use of this procedure in heart failure are provided. Fluid was removed from plasma at a rate of 500 ml/hour until either normalization of the right atrial pressure (which was increased in all cases) was achieved or the hematocrit exceeded 50 percent. According to these criteria, the duration of treatment ranged from four to six hours and the total amount of fluid removed was 2,000 to 3,000 ml. In each case, hemofiltration promoted relief of dyspnea and of clinical and radiographic evidence of lung congestion and pleural effusion, and substantially reduced the dependent edema and abdominal girth. These effects were paralleled by progressive decrease of the right (-70 percent) and left (-45 percent) ventricular filling pressures and of the pulmonary arterial pressure and arteriolar resistance, without significant variations in heart rate, aortic pressure, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance. Changes in the right atrial and wedge pulmonary pressures are interpreted as reflecting a combined effect of a decrease in pressure on the outside of the heart due to fluid reabsorption (from lung interstitial spaces and pericardial, pleural and abdominal cavities) and of intravascular volume subtraction. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen was raised, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and pH were unchanged, and urinary output was substantially enhanced by the procedure. The study indicates that: hemofiltration may be a short-term treatment for refractory cardiac insufficiency with overhydration; a filtration rate of 500 ml/hour is effective and safe; and the central venous pressure may be a reliable guide to volume subtraction.\r"

  ".W": "Eight women with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and hyperprolactinemia, of whom six had macroadenomas and two had microadenomas, were treated with conventional (cobalt-60) external radiotherapy, and their progress was monitored for eight to 15 years. Normoprolactinemia was established in five of these patients after two to 13 years (median, nine years). A recurrence was treated surgically in one patient, and stable prolactin values and roentgenographic features have been maintained in two patients. Hypopituitarism has developed in only one patient to date, and no other complications of radiotherapy have been observed. These findings, together with the few previous reports on the long-term effects of radiotherapy on macroprolactinomas, have been compared with the long-term results following surgery or dopamine agonist therapy. The normalization of prolactin values is considerably delayed following radiotherapy compared with the other two therapeutic modalities. However, radiotherapy affords permanent normalization without recurrence in a larger percentage of patients than does surgery and avoids the considerable ongoing cost and inconvenience of daily drug ingestion. The long-term development of hypopituitarism appears to be an acceptably small risk of radiotherapy. Thus, conventional radiotherapy is an attractive treatment option, particularly for macroprolactinomas; adjunctive bromocriptine can be used while awaiting the longer-term benefits of radiotherapy.\r"

The same patients were then reanalyzed utilizing a cohort study design to investigate outcomes from this syndrome. The following elevated odds ratios (95 percent confidence interval) were found while simultaneously adjusting for possible confounding variables using logistic regression: volume depletion, 9.4 (2.1 to 42.8); aminoglycoside use, 5.6 (1.3 to 23.7); congestive heart failure 9.0 (2.1 to 38.9); radiocontrast exposure, 4.9 (1.2 to 19.7); and septic shock, approached infinity, p less than 0.0001. The effect of volume depletion was markedly accentuated in those with diabetes (odds ratio = 1.9) (p less than 0.05). The risk from aminoglycoside use markedly increased with increasing age (p less than 0.002). Finally, the development of hospital-acquired acute renal failure was associated with a marked increase in the risk of dying--the relative risk (95 percent confidence interval) was 6.2 (2.6 to 14.9)--and a marked increase in length of stay, from a median of 13 days in control subjects to a median of 23 days in case subjects (p = 0.005). In conclusion, hospital-acquired acute renal failure is a serious illness. Attempts to prevent it should focus on proved risk factors.\r"

Two patients had both decreased gamma-carboxyglutamic acid urinary concentration and decreased extra-skeletal uptake on technetium 99m-diphosphonate whole-body nuclear scanning. In a subsequent double-blind placebo study, two thirds of the patients receiving 1 mg per day of warfarin had decreases in extra-skeletal nuclear tracer uptake after 18 months, compared with none of the four patients receiving placebo. No patient had a change in clinical assessment, bleeding complication, or baseline normal prothrombin time. This low-dose warfarin regimen appears to have no demonstrable adverse effects, and these results suggest a beneficial effect on the progression of calcinosis in these rheumatic diseases.\r"

This raises questions regarding the utility of the arterial lactate level as an indicator of tissue hypoperfusion in critically ill patients with hepatic dysfunction. The incidence of hyperlactatemia in a group of critically ill patients with liver disease and its association with clinical indicators of circulatory shock as well as hospital mortality were examined. The medical records of all patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit of Detroit Receiving Hospital between July 1, 1984, and June 30, 1985, with parenchymal liver disease and a total bilirubin level of more than 2 mg/dl were reviewed. Patients were excluded if lactate was not assayed. The severity of liver disease was assessed by Child's classification. Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and at least two of the following: urine output of less than 20 ml/hour, evidence of decreased skin perfusion, or acutely altered mentation. These criteria were met in 35 patients; three patients had two medical intensive care unit admissions separated by more than one week. There were two patients in Child's class A, three in class B, and 30 in class C. Shock was identified in 27 of the 38 medical intensive care unit admissions. In the group with shock, the maximal lactate level ranged from 1.2 to 30 mM (mean, 9.6). The lactate level was significantly lower (p less than 0.0005) in the group without shock, ranging from 0.6 to 2.0 mM (mean, 1.3). The mean bilirubin level was significantly higher in the group without shock (16.7 mg/dl) than in the group with shock (8.5 mg/dl). A maximal arterial lactate concentration of more than 2.2 mM was significantly associated with hospital mortality. Thus, lactic acidosis in critically ill patients with liver disease is associated with clinical evidence of shock and with increased hospital mortality.\r"

The authors studied 20 hypothyroid patients using M-mode echocardiography before and after l-thyroxine therapy. Fifteen additional hypothyroid patients were studied using two-dimensional echocardiography to confirm the data of the first study. The findings were the same in both studies: during hypothyroidism, the interventricular septum is thickened, the ratio of septal thickness to left ventricular posterior wall thickening is increased, the right ventricular wall is thickened, regional wall motion of interventricular septum and right ventricular wall is decreased, and global function of the left ventricle is decreased. These findings are reversed with l-thyroxine therapy; they occur within 6 months of the development of hypothyroidism, but appear unrelated to elevated TSH levels. Whether the thickened interventricular septum and right ventricular wall represent true muscular hypertrophy requires further elucidation. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate the existence of a hypothyroid cardiomyopathy.\r"

Serum cholesterol improved in both groups compared to their respective baseline values (p less than 0.05). In addition, serum triglyceride was lower (p less than 0.05) in the combined therapy as compared with NPH alone therapy. Insulin requirements were decreased by 23% (p less than 0.002) in the combined therapy group, without significant change in weight, glycemic control, or C-peptide levels. However, C-peptide increments in the combined therapy group were significantly higher than the baseline by 70% (p less than 0.02). NPH plus tolazamide therapy as compared with NPH alone lowers insulin requirement in obese, type II diabetic women without significant alteration in glycemic control, possibly by an increased tissue sensitivity to insulin, and decreases serum triglyceride levels.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumonias in adults due to mycoplasma, chlamydiae, and viruses are a common clinical problem. These microorganisms contribute to the etiologies in 6-35% of all cases of pneumonia and are the sole pathogens in 1-17% of hospitalized cases. Important trends and developments in the field include the emergence of a Chlamydia psittaci strain (TWAR) that is passaged from human to human, causes a mycoplasma-like illness, and that is relatively resistant to erythromycin, the recognition of respiratory syncytial virus as a pathogen in nursing home outbreaks and in immunosuppressed adults, the continuing high lethality of fully developed influenza pneumonia, the efficacy of acyclovir and adenine arabinoside in limiting the complications of varicella-zoster virus infections, and the increasing frequency of pneumonia caused by cytomegalovirus and the severity of this disorder in highly immunosuppressed patients. Developments in the rapid diagnosis and therapy of respiratory syncytial virus infections with an aerosolized antiviral drug in children may pave the way for comparable advances in difficult pneumonias in adult patients.\r"

In humans, capillary hydrostatic pressure cannot be measured directly but may be calculated when the colloid osmotic pressure in plasma and interstitial fluid and interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure are known (Starling equation). New methods have made it possible to measure the interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure and interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure. In the present study interstitial fluid was collected from the subcutaneous tissue by implanted wicks (wick method), and interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure was determined. Interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure was recorded by the wick-in-needle technique. Capillary hydrostatic pressure was calculated in 10 women in the first trimester and 10 in the third trimester of normal pregnancy, in 15 patients with mild preeclampsia, and in 13 women with severe preeclampsia. In normal pregnancy, capillary hydrostatic pressure increased by about 30% between the first and third trimesters. In mild preeclampsia, capillary hydrostatic pressure values did not differ significantly from those in the third trimester of normal pregnancy. However, in severe preeclampsia capillary hydrostatic pressure was significantly lower (40%) than in mild preeclampsia. Whether the low capillary hydrostatic pressure is caused by the severe general vasospasm seen in this condition or is a secondary event is unknown.\r"

Fetal body movements were recorded simultaneously by use of real-time ultrasound. The study group was divided into two subgroups, according to the presence (n = 29) or absence (n = 8) of antepartum late heart rate decelerations. Correlations were made with umbilical blood gas values obtained immediately after cesarean section. Baseline heart rate variation was reduced below the normal range in 88% of the intrauterine growth-retarded fetuses with decelerations but in only 37% of the group without decelerations. A reduction in fetal heart rate accelerations and body movements and an increase in mean heart rate also were observed only in the group with decelerations. Late heart rate decelerations were associated with low PO2 values in both umbilical artery and vein. It is concluded that in intrauterine growth-retarded fetuses reduced heart rate variation and movement incidence correlate with the presence of late heart rate decelerations before birth and with hypoxemia at birth.\r"

  ".U": "87267887\r", 
  ".W": "Several studies indicate the presence of different pituitary hormones or neuropeptides in ovarian follicular fluid from various species. Recently our group showed that the ovarian follicular fluid of health women contains two of the endogenous opioid peptides, beta-endorphin and methionine enkephalin, in concentrations that are tenfold to twentyfold higher than in circulating plasma. The presence of immunoreactive beta-lipotropin was also shown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether adrenocorticotropic hormone, which in pituitary cells is synthesized from proopiomelanocortin such as beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin, is also present in follicular fluid and the possible changes of proopiomelanocortin-related peptides during the menstrual cycle. Concentrations of beta-endorphin, methionine enkephalin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and beta-lipotropin were measured in 60 healthy menstruating women at different periods of the menstrual cycle (20 during the follicular, 22 in the preovulatory days, and 18 during the luteal phase). Thirteen women participated in an in vitro fertilization program and thus received clomiphene citrate (100 mg/day from the fifth to the ninth day) plus 5000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin before starting the program. All samples were collected at laparoscopy under general anesthesia. In another eight patients fluid was collected from follicular cysts. Peptides were extracted on octadodecasilyl silica columns with 80% methanol in 0.5 mol/L acetic acid. The identity of follicular fluid beta-endorphin, methionine enkephalin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and beta-lipotropin and standard peptides was demonstrated with high-pressure liquid chromatography. Peptide concentrations were measured in extracts by radioimmunoassays either directly by (methionine enkephalin and adrenocorticotropic hormone) or after (beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin) gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The concentrations of methionine enkephalin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and beta-lipotropin were similar in the different periods of the cycle. Conversely, beta-endorphin concentrations were significantly higher in preovulatory days than in the other periods; no differences were evident between spontaneous and stimulated cycles. These results indicate that proopiomelanocortin-related peptides are present in the follicular fluid and that beta-endorphin concentrations change during the menstrual cycle, with the highest values occurring in the preovulatory follicle.\r"

Urinary excretion of magnesium rose 21-fold and calcium excretion rose threefold in patients receiving intramuscular magnesium sulfate in both the oxytocin and the nonoxytocin groups. Sixty-five percent of the administered magnesium was excreted during the treatment period, again with no significant differences between the oxytocin and the nonoxytocin groups. These results indicate that oxytocin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of intramuscular magnesium sulfate and no dosage adjustment of magnesium sulfate is required when oxytocin is used to induce or augment labor or when it is given during the postpartum period.\r"

The incidence of fetal distress in labor was significantly higher in those who had spurious labor (16.7%) than in those who were established in labor within 24 hours of admission (3.8%). An equivocal or ominous fetal heart rate trace on admission was related to the occurrence of fetal distress in labor in both the spurious labor group and the normal labor group. Positive predictive value of a normal test was low in the spurious labor group. Obstetric interventions such as augmentation (35.7%) and operative deliveries (41.0%) were significantly higher in the spurious labor group than in the normal labor group (19.7% and 18.8%, respectively). The induction rate in the spurious labor group was 15.5%. The use of oxytocin for augmentation and induction of labor seems to contribute to the increased incidence of fetal distress and operative deliveries in the spurious labor group. The spurious labor group also had a higher incidence of fetal distress than the control group even among the patients who did not receive oxytocin. The results suggest that patients with an episode of spurious labor constitute a high-risk group with a considerable risk of fetal distress and obstetric interventions in subsequent labor.\r"

Both drugs produced a dose-related decrease in contraction strength, as measured by the time-integrated force of contraction. Aminophylline lengthened the period of contraction in a manner that was not dose dependent. Low-dose nifedipine (5 micrograms/L) increased the period of contraction, but higher doses had no effect on frequency. Both drugs produced a net reduction in the effectiveness of labor, as measured by the average force (time-integrated force divided by period). These results indicate that both aminophylline and nifedipine may be clinically useful tocolytic agents.\r"

Both inversion-recovery and spin-echo proton images were obtained, demonstrating good detail of fetal and maternal anatomy. The placenta was particularly easy to identify, and its image was further enhanced by a bolus infusion of manganese chloride. Manganese is one of several paramagnetic ions that shortens proton relaxation times, and as a result alters signal intensity in magnetic resonance imaging. An infusion of 10 mumol/kg of manganese chloride was chosen on the basis of an in vitro experiment demonstrating shortening of the spin-lattice relaxation time at increasing concentrations of manganese. Additional studies showed rapid serum clearance of manganese after an intravenous dose with subsequent rapid uptake in the placenta. These results demonstrate that manganese is potentially suitable for studying placental blood flow with magnetic resonance imaging.\r"

The results demonstrate that glucose concentrations approximately 50% of normal maternal levels were teratogenic but not growth inhibitory, whereas concentrations in the range of 30% to 40% of maternal levels were lethal to the embryo. Furthermore, a 14-hour exposure to reduced blood sugar in either the first or second half of the culture period produced malformations.\r"

The maternal and fetal blood had ethanol concentrations that were maximal at 5 hours and were virtually identical during the 24-hour study. There was delayed transfer of ethanol into the amniotic and allantoic fluids during the dosing period, followed by higher ethanol concentrations in these fluids during the elimination phase compared with fetal blood. The ethanol elimination rate was similar for the four biologic fluids. Acetaldehyde concentrations in the four fluids were a thousandfold less than the respective ethanol concentrations. The maternal blood acetaldehyde concentration was greater than that in fetal blood. The data indicate that for a binge-type drinking episode during near-term pregnancy, there is unimpeded bidirectional placental transfer of ethanol between the mother and the fetus; the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is a reservoir for ethanol in utero; elimination of ethanol from the maternal-fetal unit is regulated by maternal hepatic biotransformation of ethanol; and there is appreciable acetaldehyde-oxidizing capacity in the maternal liver and at extrahepatic sites.\r"

  ".W": "The anatomic distribution of cervical adenocarcinoma in situ was ascertained in 23 cases of adenocarcinoma in situ, 10 of which also had \"early\" invasive adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma in situ involved both surface and gland epithelia in all cases, involved a variable number of quadrants, involved glands beneath the transformation zone in about two thirds of cases, was multifocal only occasionally, extended up the endocervical canal for a variable distance (up to 30 mm), and was associated with squamous dysplasia in about half of cases. From this topographic outline of adenocarcinoma in situ, it is recommended that if cervical conization is chosen as conservative therapy for adenocarcinoma in situ the \"cone\" be cylindrical in shape, to include the transformation zone and deep glands, and extend at least 25 mm up the endocervical canal.\r"
