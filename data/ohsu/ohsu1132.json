  ".W": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist is accompanied by a reactive rise in renin release. This rise is generally attributed to interruption of the short feedback loop between Ang II and renin release. Similarly, after the administration of a renin inhibitor, the plasma concentrations of active and total renin are increased and plasma renin activity is suppressed. The aim of the present study was to investigate if a fall in the plasma Ang II level is the unique determinant of the rise in the active renin (AR) level that follows renin inhibition. Six normal male volunteers participated in three successive 240-minute experiments at weekly intervals according to a single-blind randomized Latin square design. For experiment 1, Ang II was infused at 2 ng/kg/min from 0 to 60 minutes and at 4 ng/kg/min from 60 to 120 minutes. For experiment 2, 0.3 mg/kg of the new potent renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892 was injected at 30 minutes followed by infusion at 0.1 mg/kg/hr from 30 to 240 minutes. For experiment 3, Ang II and Ro 42-5892 were administered simultaneously at the same doses as described above. The mean +/- SEM Ang II concentration increased from 10.2 +/- 1.6 to 33.7 +/- 11.2 pg/ml after infusion of exogenous peptide. It decreased from 9.5 +/- 0.9 to 1.4 +/- 0.3 pg/ml after the injection of Ro 42-5892 and increased from 15.6 +/- 2.9 to 37.1 +/- 11.8 pg/ml after the simultaneous infusion of both compounds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Isoproterenol (0.03, 0.01, 0.3 microgram/100 ml/min for 5 minutes each; n = 5) was infused into the brachial artery, and active and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine forearm balance (venous-arterial differences corrected for forearm blood flow by strain-gauge plethysmography) were measured. Isoproterenol caused vasodilation and a dose-dependent active and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine outflow, an effect blunted by propranolol (10 micrograms/100 ml/min). To evaluate the role of local angiotensin II on beta-mediated norepinephrine overflow, the experiment was repeated with captopril (2.5 micrograms/100 ml/min for 10 minutes; n = 5), which abolished angiotensin II release and significantly reduced norepinephrine overflow. To test whether angiotensin II facilitates both prejunctional norepinephrine release and its postjunctional action, we evaluated the effect of exogenous angiotensin II, infused into the brachial artery at low concentrations (0.001 microgram/100 ml/min), on forearm vasoconstriction and norepinephrine release induced by endogenous sympathetic activation (application of a lower body negative pressure: -10 and -20 mm Hg for 5 minutes, n = 10) and on the vasoconstrictor effect of local norepinephrine (0.0015, 0.005, 0.015, 0.05, 0.15 micrograms/100 ml/min for 3 minutes each; n = 6). Although angiotensin II increased the vasoconstricting effect and the norepinephrine release induced by lower body negative pressure, it failed to affect norepinephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. Our data indicate the existence in hypertensive individuals of a vascular renin-angiotensin system that seems to modulate sympathetic activity through the presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examines the effects of prolonged angiotensin II antagonism in spontaneously hypertensive rats by using an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (DuP 753) that is devoid of agonistic properties and selective for the subtype 1 of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptor. The antihypertensive effects of DuP 753 and its effects on circulating parameters of the renin-angiotensin system were compared with those of a converting enzyme inhibitor (benazeprilat). To minimize any influence of differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of the two blockers, administration was by continuous intravenous infusion. The experiments were performed in conscious, freely moving rats with continuous 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure. DuP 753 (10 or 30 mg/kg/day) lowered mean arterial pressure to the same extent as benazeprilat (3 or 10 mg/kg/day) during a 48-hour period. The antihypertensive effect was sustained when the treatment was extended to 7 days (DuP 753, 10 mg/kg/day; benazeprilat, 3 mg/kg/day). Neither of the compounds affected the baseline or diurnal rhythm of heart rate. Plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin II were increased sevenfold and 10-fold, respectively, in the rats treated with DuP 753. In rats treated with benazeprilat, plasma renin concentration increased threefold, whereas angiotensin II was unchanged. Heart weights were significantly reduced to a similar extent by DuP 753 and benazeprilat. Both compounds also induced a smaller but significant decrease in blood pressure in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Our results indicate that the antihypertensive effects of converting enzyme inhibitors in spontaneously hypertensive rats are mainly due to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. In this rat model, angiotensin II appears to play an important role in the maintenance of hypertension that is mediated via the AT1 receptor.\r"

  ".W": "To improve the diagnosis and forecast the response to surgery or renal angioplasty in patients with hypertension and renal artery stenosis, we employed a simplified captopril renography protocol in conjunction with renal arteriography in 94 clinically selected patients. Fifty hypertensive patients (group 1) with a high clinical likelihood of renovascular hypertension were evaluated using a simplified captopril renography protocol and renal angiography on the arterial side. Criteria for normal captopril renal scintigrams were established based on this original cohort and validated in an additional 44 clinically comparable patients (group 2). Renal revascularization or nephrectomy was performed in 39 patients, and success of the procedure was determined in the 34 patients for whom 3-month follow-up was available. In the 94 patients, 44 (47%) had renal artery stenosis. Simplified captopril renography was 91% sensitive and 94% specific in identifying or excluding renal artery stenosis in the combined group, with no difference in the diagnostic utility between groups 1 and 2, or in those with renal insufficiency (n = 38) or those with bilateral disease (n = 17). Scintigraphic abnormalities induced by captopril were strongly associated with cure or improvement in blood pressure control following revascularization or nephrectomy (15 of 18), while the lack of captopril-induced changes was associated with failure of such intervention (13 of 16) (p = 0.0004). We conclude that simplified captopril renography is highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis in a clinically selected high-risk population and that the test accurately predicts the success or failure of therapeutic intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Radioisotopic renal scanning after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) has proven to be an exciting area for research. The biologic activity of markers such as DTPA and hippuran, when combined with the physiological effects of ACEI, may provide noninvasive methods of diagnosing both renal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension. Recent investigators have demonstrated that the sensitivities and specificities of these tests may vary widely; these differences are probably due to variations in study design, patient population, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measurements. We have reviewed these studies and discuss these possible sources of variation and their impact on the clinical usefulness of these diagnostic tests, especially in relation to the prevalence of disease in the population. Current results suggest that the post-ACEI DTPA scan is relatively accurate in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, with sensitivity generally greater than 90% and specificity around 95%. However, the best results in predicting the response to angioplasty or surgery in patients with renal artery stenosis have been with the use of post-ACEI hippuran in combination with furosemide (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 95%). With confirmation of these findings and continued investigation, it is expected that accurate noninvasive tests will be available for widespread clinical use in the near future.\r"

The present binding study showed two distinct subpopulations of binding sites for endothelin-3 with higher and lower affinities in cultured human endothelial cells. Endothelin-3 caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels and activated protein kinase C in a dose-dependent manner. Endothelin-3 also caused an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA and stimulated the production of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, and immunoreactive endothelin-1 in cultured human endothelial cells. NG-Monomethyl L-arginine (3 x 10(-4) mol/l) and indomethacin (10(-5) mol/l) enhanced endothelin-3-induced endothelin-1 production. These results suggest that endothelin-3 bound to its specific receptors and then caused phosphoinositide breakdown, subsequently mobilizing intracellular Ca2+ and leading to protein kinase C activation and the initiation of DNA synthesis, resulting in the stimulation of endothelin-1 production by human endothelial cells. Furthermore, this endothelin-1 production may be suppressed by endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin produced in response to endothelin-3 in cultured human endothelial cells.\r"

When left kidney perfusion pressure was raised in rabbits (145-240 mm Hg), arterial pressure fell by 1.34 +/- 0.20 mm Hg/min. Pretreatment of the rabbits with 2-bromoethylamine hydrobromide, which destroyed the renal medulla, abolished the fall in arterial pressure (-0.08 +/- 0.08 mm Hg/min) in response to increased renal perfusion pressure. In dogs (with blockade of autonomic ganglia by pentolinium, converting enzyme inhibition [captopril/enalaprilat], and surgical renal denervation), increasing renal perfusion pressure to 170-220 mm Hg resulted in a fall in arterial pressure by 0.32 +/- 0.03 mm Hg/min (or by 28.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg over a 90-minute period). Mean arterial pressure did not change significantly in identically prepared dogs not subjected to increased renal perfusion pressure, whereas pretreatment of dogs with bromoethylamine abolished the hypotensive response to increased renal perfusion pressure. Thus, the hypotensive response to increased renal perfusion was dependent on the presence of an intact renal medulla, but hypotension still occurred in the presence of converting enzyme inhibition, autonomic ganglion blockade, and renal denervation. The results provide in vivo evidence in two species that a vasodepressor factor from the renal medulla is released in response to increased renal perfusion.\r"

Cyclosporine was started at 7.5 mg/kg/day, progressively decreased to 6.3 mg/kg/day at 6 months, and then continued at a lower dose (4.1 mg/kg/day) for an additional 3 months in patients in whom remission of insulin dependency was obtained (n = 6). After 3 months of cyclosporine, a slight but significant increase in arterial pressure (+5.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), a rise in renal vascular resistance (approximately 20%), a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (approximately 25%), and a fall in filtration fraction were observed. Such changes were sustained after 6 and eventually 9 months of therapy. The decrease in glomerular filtration rate observed during cyclosporine treatment contrasted with the lack of change in simultaneously estimated creatinine clearance; in fact, the creatinine clearance/glomerular filtration ratio increased from 1.07 +/- 0.05% to 1.33 +/- 0.09% within 3 months of cyclosporine therapy, thus suggesting an enhanced tubular secretion of creatinine. Plasma renin activity and urinary excretion of kallikrein decreased significantly (approximately 50%), whereas plasma aldosterone concentration remained unaltered and plasma concentration of potassium increased during cyclosporine therapy. These changes were observed in the presence of a constant urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and a constant body weight. All parameters returned to pretreatment values within 3 months after cessation of cyclosporine. These results indicate that cyclosporine given for 6-9 months at a moderate dose causes a deleterious but reversible effect on arterial pressure and renal function in young diabetic patients.\r"

Glucose tolerance, assessed as the glucose fractional disappearance rate between 3 and 11 minutes after the glucose injection, was similar in the clipped and sham groups (0.059 +/- 0.002 versus 0.056 +/- 0.002 min-1, respectively; p greater than 0.4). The total area under the insulin curve during glucose tolerance tests was also similar in the clipped and sham groups (926 +/- 95 versus 869 +/- 126 microunits/ml x min; p greater than 0.4). There was no significant relation between systolic blood pressure and insulin area during glucose tolerance tests in the clipped group, but there was a positive rectilinear relation in the control group (r = 0.66; p = 0.01). Fourteen animals had euglycemic clamps 2 months after glucose tolerance tests. At that time, systolic pressure (direct femoral measurement) was higher in the seven clipped animals (189 +/- 13 mm Hg versus 122 +/- 5 mm Hg in controls; p less than 0.001).

The current study was undertaken to characterize amine uptake and effects of its inhibition in an isolated human artery from normotensive subjects and to provide a basis for future study in hypertensive individuals. Accumulation of tritiated norepinephrine into the artery of normotensive subjects was time-dependent and 16.9-fold more than the incubation media concentration (1 microM) of amine after 60 minutes. There was a lesser accumulation of tritiated normetanephrine (3.1-fold), and it was not increased over time. Increasing the concentration of norepinephrine to 30 microM did not significantly change the proportional accumulation. Inhibition of neuronal uptake with cocaine (10 microM) reduced the average accumulation of both concentrations of tritiated norepinephrine to 3.9-fold (p less than 0.001). Inhibition of extraneuronal uptake with corticosterone alone (10 microM) had no significant effect on average accumulation of norepinephrine, and where combined with cocaine, there was no further effect of corticosterone. Neither cocaine nor corticosterone had any effects on accumulation of normetanephrine. In spite of elimination of approximately 75% of the uptake of norepinephrine, cocaine had very little potentiating effect on mechanical responses to exogenous norepinephrine and neurally released transmitter. Thus, norepinephrine uptake in human cystic artery is characteristic of neuronal uptake, but cocaine treatment has only a very modest potentiating effect on responsiveness to endogenous norepinephrine and no significant effect on responsiveness to exogenous amine.\r"

We now report that intravenous infusion of N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate, a specific active site-directed inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.15, produces an immediate drop in mean arterial pressure of as much as 50 mm Hg in pentobarbital-anesthetized, normotensive rats. Arterial pressure recovers within 5 minutes. The B2 bradykinin antagonist [Arg0,Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin attenuates the decrease in mean arterial pressure resulting from treatment with the inhibitor. The endopeptidase-24.15 inhibitor potentiates the hypotensive effect of intravenous bradykinin infusion, increasing the maximal effect of the peptide by 47% and increasing the potency by almost 10-fold, while the response to intra-arterial bradykinin is less affected by the inhibitor. These results support a role for endopeptidase-24.15 in the inactivation of endogenous and exogenous bradykinin and suggest a direct involvement of the enzyme in the control of blood pressure.\r"

In this editorial we discuss the possible role of kinins as common mediators of part of the vasodepressor action of these peptidase inhibitors. Genden and Molineaux report that the marked fall in blood pressure caused by the EP-24.15 inhibitor is almost abolished by a kinin receptor antagonist, supporting the hypothesis that kinins play a role in the regulation of normal blood pressure. We have confirmed that the EP-24.15 inhibitor used by these investigators lowers blood pressure. Up to now, EP-24.15 has not been implicated in in vivo metabolism of kinins. Although a number of kininases have been identified, our own previous work indicated that the metabolic pathway responsible for clearing kinins from the circulation involves the action of kininase II (angiotensin I converting enzyme) and renal peptidases. Nevertheless, the main metabolic pathway involved some other unidentified enzyme, since in these experiments disappearance of kinins from the circulation was only marginally reduced by a \"cocktail\" of inhibitors of ACE, EP-24.11, and carboxypeptidase N. It could be that EP-24.15 is involved in kinin metabolism. However, a number of questions need to be answered with regard to the mechanism by which the EP-24.15 inhibitor lowers blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "While clinicians have long recognized the apparent increased prevalence of hypertension among diabetics, sophisticated epidemiological analyses begun in the early 1970s have established that hypertensive individuals are more prone to hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance than normotensive individuals. Subsequently, the several hypertensinogenic effects of insulin were carefully studied in a number of laboratories. Most recently, the association of these two relatively common cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and insulin resistance, was broadened to include lipid abnormalities, namely, increased concentrations of very low density lipoprotein triglycerides and decreased concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. These abnormalities, all of which appear in association more commonly than would be expected by chance, clearly predispose affected individuals to increased cardiovascular risk. This review summarizes our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relations between insulin resistance and hypertension and focuses discussion on the role of insulin as a common link between them. It concludes with recommendations, based on today's knowledge, for behavioral and therapeutic interventions aimed at the prevention of increased cardiovascular risk.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension has been related to both obesity and a high salt intake. Evidence for the associations of blood pressure with body weight and dietary salt intake is summarized. In both adolescents and adults correlations between blood pressure and weight are highly significant, and in longitudinal studies change in blood pressure over time is correlated with change in weight. Correlations between salt intake and blood pressure are less striking, and the results of trials of modest salt restriction demonstrate a small but significant effect on blood pressure. Individuals vary in their susceptibility to salt, and hypertensive individuals are more responsive than normotensive individuals. Dietary deficiencies of potassium and calcium may amplify the effect of a high salt intake on blood pressure. Animal models provide compelling evidence for a genetic component to salt sensitivity of blood pressure. In two hypertension prevention trials, change in blood pressure was more convincingly related to change in weight than to change in dietary salt. Avoidance of obesity, or weight reduction in overweight individuals, should be key strategies for hypertension prevention. Avoidance of salt excess is also appropriate, although currently available trial data do not justify a recommendation of rigorous salt restriction for the entire population.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is an established risk factor for all the clinical sequelae of coronary artery disease. Despite this, individual therapeutic trials of antihypertensive therapy have not demonstrated the expected reduction in coronary morbidity and mortality. This apparent failure is perhaps not surprising when one considers the multifactorial nature of coronary artery disease and the different ways in which hypertension may affect the coronary circulation. Much debate has also centered on the antihypertensive therapy used in major trials in that it may in some way prevent the reduction in coronary mortality. However, thus far no clear evidence of a harmful effect has emerged. Reducing coronary mortality in hypertensive patients is a major challenge but one that can be effectively surmounted by approaching these different factors in a concerted manner. The ultimate goal must be to prevent the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, but until such time as that can be achieved, the early detection of hypertension is mandatory. The optimal levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressures must be established. Studies on the more recent antihypertensive agents hold promise for a more specific effect on the atherosclerotic process as well as sustained control of arterial blood pressure. In this regard, it would seem essential to develop more precise ways of quantifying atherosclerosis and thus clarifying the nature of its relation to hypertension. Finally, management of hypertension must include precise assessment of the patient's overall cardiovascular risk status and appropriate and aggressive management of all risk factors for coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".U": "91365448\r", 
  ".W": "The left ventricle increases its mass and wall thickness in hypertension as a result of the progressive increase in hemodynamic overload offered by increasing arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance. However, evidence is increasing that nonhemodynamic factors may also be important in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This LVH resulting from hypertensive disease conveys an independent risk of premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The specific mechanisms accounting for this increased risk are not known with assurance, although several mechanisms are under active study; they include more prominently ventricular dysrhythmias and myocardial ischemia. It is possible to diminish the increased left ventricular mass with pharmacological agents, although currently it is not known whether this reversal also diminishes the risk associated with LVH. Therefore, at the present time the best means for preventing the risk of LVH is to prevent its development in the first place, and this seems to be preventable through control of arterial blood pressure at the earliest stages of hypertension. Risk may also be diminished in patients with existing LVH who are receiving digitalis or diuretics or who have chronic fluid- and electrolyte-disturbing diseases. Under these circumstances, the careful use and selection of antihypertensive therapy and control of electrolyte balance no doubt will prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality.\r"

Malignant, severe, and moderate hypertension have all been shown to be worthy of drug treatment, but controversy remains as to the degree of benefit that is achievable by treating milder hypertension. A variety of clinical trials have demonstrated that antihypertensive therapy reduces the incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy and the progression in severity of hypertension. The benefits with respect to prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) have been much less impressive. Thiazide diuretics have been the base therapy for the bulk of the hypertensive subjects studied to date who have not demonstrated reduced incidence of CHD. Therapy with beta-blockers has the potential for reducing CHD, but an analysis of four studies finds only two with positive results. On the other hand, since that study found reduced total mortality as well as CHD compared with thiazide diuretic, its findings cannot be ignored. Other questions deserving further investigation include how other antihypertensive therapies compare with respect to the risk reduction found with thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, the optimal posttreatment blood pressure, whether persons with mild hypertension benefit from therapy, whether women should be treated differently, and whether atherosclerosis may be affected by specific antihypertensive therapies.\r"

  ".W": "Blood pressure has a genetic component influenced by several to many genetic loci in both humans and animals; that is, blood pressure is a polygenic trait. Ultimately, the primary causes of genetic hypertension can only be established with genetic techniques. The primary tools for this analysis in animals are inbred strains of rodents selectively bred for differences in blood pressure and the genetic analysis of these strains by cosegregation techniques. This analysis determines whether it is possible to separate specific alleles at a candidate genetic locus from a component of blood pressure in genetically segregating populations. If the candidate alleles cosegregate with a component of blood pressure, these alleles must be the cause of the blood pressure differences or be linked on the same chromosome to alleles at other loci that cause blood pressure differences. If, on the other hand, the candidate alleles do not cosegregate with blood pressure, they cannot be the cause of the blood pressure differences. This analysis is straightforward in the case of a single-locus Mendelian candidate trait but is less informative if a candidate trait is itself polygenic. In this case, genetic analysis yields either 1) results that are compatible with, but not definitive proof for, a genetic role of the trait in causing blood pressure differences or 2) results that eliminate the trait as a cause of genetic differences in blood pressure. A complete listing of all the traits that have undergone genetic cosegregation analysis in rodents is given.\r"

  ".W": "An overview of published observations suggests that both genetic predisposition and environment work together to produce hypertension in most persons. High blood pressure before age 55 occurs 3.8 times more often among persons with a strong positive family history of high blood pressure. Much of the total variability in blood pressure in modern populations seems attributable to genetic factors. Estimates of the proportion of the variance attributable to all genetic factors (heritability [H2]) vary from 25% in pedigree studies to 65% in twin studies for sitting diastolic blood pressure. Several biochemical traits associated with high blood pressure are highly genetic (H2, 78-84%) and may help elucidate the pathophysiology of high blood pressure. While pertinent environmental factors such as salt intake, alcohol use, and amount of exercise also correlate significantly among relatives, only 7% of the total variance of diastolic blood pressure seems attributable to all shared environmental factors in family households. Thus most familial aggregation of high blood pressure appears to be due to genes rather than shared family environment. Practical benefit may result from identifying familial predisposition in multiple siblings with high blood pressure before age 55 and lipid abnormalities (labeled \"familial dyslipidemic hypertension\"). About 12% of high blood pressure patients have familial dyslipidemic hypertension and also have high risk of early coronary heart disease. Hyperinsulinemia and central obesity as well as high triglycerides and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol are prominent features of familial dyslipidemic hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although functional changes (i.e., increased vascular smooth muscle sensitivity) have been found to be associated with some models of hypertension (e.g., spontaneously hypertensive rat), in human essential hypertension it appears that the abnormalities that predominate in the resistance vasculature are structural in nature. These changes result in an increased media/lumen ratio of the more proximal resistance vessels (i.d. 100-300 microns), and the changes are such that they could account for many of the altered hemodynamic characteristics seen in patients with essential hypertension (e.g., increased minimum vascular resistance, increased pressor response). However, evidence that the abnormal structure of the peripheral vasculature is a prime determinant of blood pressure is still lacking, and much of the available evidence suggests that the altered structure is a secondary adaptation. Nevertheless, the abnormal vascular structure may play an important pathological role concerning the morbid consequences of the hypertensive disease, suggesting that normalization of vascular structure is a desirable aim for antihypertensive treatment. At present it seems that treatment must be continued for long periods, maybe many years, before vascular structure is normalized.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive hormones acting as endocrine, neuroendocrine, or local hormonal systems (intracrine, autocrine, and paracrine) are an important component of the many factors that regulate blood pressure. Hypertension may be the result of an alteration in the balance between vasodepressor and vasopressor hormonal systems. Changes in this balance could be due to genetic factors such as mutations in one of the genes of the vasoactive system or environmental factors that alter the synthesis and release of one or more vasoactive hormones. Endocrine and neuroendocrine vasopressor hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system and catecholamines, play a well-established and important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of some secondary forms of hypertension. The blockade of such systems has already resulted in effective antihypertensive treatment. The role of local hormonal systems is less well established; however, recent evidence suggests they also play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension. Some vasopressor hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system, can act as both endocrine or local hormonal systems. Work using transgenic rats harboring the mouse Ren-2 gene has conclusively demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system, acting as a local hormonal system, has the capability to cause severe hypertension. Whether this model of experimental hypertension mimics any type of human hypertension is not known. Vasodepressor hormones such as kinins, prostaglandins, and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) act mainly as local hormonal systems, with the notable exception of atrial natriuretic factor, which may act as both an endocrine and a local hormone. The tissue kallikrein-kinin system, acting either directly or via paracrine eicosanoids or EDRF, participates in local regulation of the circulation, renal function, and the acute antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) that distinguishes the kallikrein gene family of a strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) from normotensive Brown Norway rats has been identified. In a set of 32 recombinant inbred strains derived from these SHR and Brown Norway strains, the RFLP marking the kallikrein gene family of SHR cosegregated with an increase in blood pressure. Also, in a study of Utah families it was found that a dominant-allele kallikrein gene expressed as high urinary kallikrein excretion was associated with a decreased risk of essential hypertension. In conclusion, vasopressor and vasodepressor hormones, acting not only as endocrine but also as local hormones, play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

It is suspected that children whose blood pressures are greatest for their age or body size may be destined for future hypertension. However, it is apparent that some children with lower blood pressures are also destined for hypertension as adults. Children with a family history of hypertension demonstrate greater blood pressure and heart rate responses to mental challenge. These responses are enhanced when a high salt diet is consumed. Increased maximal exercise systolic blood pressure and increased left ventricular wall mass in childhood add significantly to the prediction of future high blood pressure. In addition, the acquisition of excess weight for height from childhood to young adult life adds to the prediction of future blood pressure elevations. Both children and adults who are obese have significantly higher blood pressures than those who are lean. Approximately 34% of the variability in body mass index is explained by genotype differences at a single recessive locus, 41% by genotype differences at polygenic loci, and 25% by nongenetic factors. Thus, the genetic influence of obesity may be an important factor responsible for elevated blood pressure in both children and adults.\r"

  ".U": "91365462\r", 
  ".W": "This report deals with three aspects of risk related to blood pressure and high blood pressure. The first aspect of risk concerns distributions of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the adult population and their relation to long-term risk of morbidity and mortality. By middle age, only a minority (about 20%) of Americans have optimal SBP and DBP levels, less than 120 mm Hg and less than 80 mm Hg, respectively. For the majority with higher levels, risks of major clinical events, including death from cardiovascular diseases and from all causes, are markedly increased. The relations of SBP and DBP with risk are strong, continuous, and graded. Risk is sizable not only for persons with high blood pressure by usual clinical criteria (SBP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or DBP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg), but also for those with \"high-normal\" blood pressure (e.g., SBP 130-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg). Thus, the blood pressure problem is a population-wide one and requires for its control a combined population-wide and high-risk strategy. A major component of this strategy must be nutritional-hygienic measures for the primary prevention of the rise in blood pressure during adulthood and of high blood pressure (i.e., primary prevention not only of the complications of high blood pressure but also of high blood pressure itself) through improved lifestyles having the potential to shift downward the blood pressure distribution of the whole population. The second aspect of risk concerns the known risk factors (i.e., aspects of modern lifestyle) leading to the mass occurrence of blood pressure rise during adulthood and of high blood pressure. These risk factors are high salt intake, high dietary sodium/potassium ratio, calorie imbalance and resultant obesity, and high alcohol intake. The extensive data base establishing the role of these common traits in the etiology of the blood pressure/high blood pressure problem is the scientific foundation for efforts to achieve the primary prevention of high blood pressure. The third aspect of risk relates to the combined impact of other risk factors along with blood pressure-high blood pressure in markedly increasing the probabilities of morbidity and mortality (e.g., \"rich\" diet, diet-dependent serum cholesterol and uric acid, smoking, diabetes, and target-organ damage). Prevention and control of lifestyle-related traits are essential components of the strategy for dealing with the blood pressure-high blood pressure problem.\r"

The sorbents passed through one limb of intestine isolated from food contact to join a food limb which included 30-40% of the original length of small intestine. In goats, serum creatinine levels were elevated by infusion of sterile creatinine solutions intravenously. Twenty-four hour urines were collected before, during and after periods of infusion of sorbents into the inlet ostomy. Infusion of charcoal into the ostomy had little effect on the total daily urinary creatinine excretion (TDUC). However infusion of 4.3 g/kg/day ethanol decreased the TDUC significantly, in both species. In rats, 8.6 g/kg/day ethanol infusion had an even greater effect on TDUC. Studies of intraluminal creatinine concentration in the distal part of the sorbent segment indicated that especially when serum concentration of creatinine is over 2 mg%, ethanol greatly increases the intraluminal creatinine concentration in the intestine. It is concluded that ethanol, in combination with intestinal sorbents or alone, could allow intestinal dialysis to remove considerably more creatinine, and possibly aid transport of other organic substances.\r"

By measuring blood density uninterrupted over a period of time using the mechanical oscillatory technique it is possible to follow the dynamics of protein deposition at the interface between the blood and capillary walls. The resulting picture of the deposition behaviour can lead to a better understanding of time-dependent filtration where flow and pressure conditions change. Protein deposition (Pt) with polysulfone membranes in relation to the effective capillary surface was in the range of 2.2. mg/(h x cm2) according to a logarithmic function (Pt = a + b x log(t)).\r"

The movement is described by the rolling without sliding of the leaflet surface around a cylindrical surface on the inner wall of the housing. The opening angle is 85 degrees. Both the leaflets and the housing are machined from a solid piece of titanium and then covered with carbon by ion beam techniques.

In six sheep the 14 mm diameter jugular vein was inserted into a 12 cm long, 6 mm diameter Dacron mesh tube and implanted as a femoropopliteal graft. On the contralateral side the femoral vein with a maximal diameter of 7 to 8 mm was implanted. At control angiography after two months all grafts were patent, none of the wrapped grafts showed wrinkles or signs of anastomotic hyperplasia. Segments of wrapped veins were casted in paraffin under physiological pressure and cut transversely. In all cases the vein wall was pressed against the mesh tubes without forming folds. Mesh-wrapped varicose veins were used for three femorocrural and seven femoropopliteal reconstructions. All grafts showed a smooth flow surface at control angiography. Indentations occurred only at sites where thick-walled side branches had been ligated rather than oversewn. One popliteo-pedal reconstruction occluded after two months and one patient with a crural reconstruction died two months after surgery with a patent graft. The remaining grafts were patent after 11 (2-32) months. Oversized veins can be considerably constricted by tubes without forming wrinkles. By this technique varicose veins can be used as bypass grafts and in general vein grafts can be matched in size to the recipient vessel.\r"

We performed the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in four patients and the hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in 14. In one patient both clamps were done. The mean priming time to reach steady-state glycemia was 20 min. Plasma insulin concentrations were measured every 20 min. This new automatic glucose clamp technique enables the priming phase to be run without any significant overshoot, and accidental variations of glycemia in steady state were reduced to a minimum. The system showed satisfactory safety and stability in controlling the patient's glycemia and assured high speed of the priming phase.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine the anatomical distribution of cells concerned with relaying craniovascular nociception, local cerebral glucose utilization was determined by the 2-deoxyglucose method in tissue autoradiographs of the alpha-chloralose anesthetized cat. The superior sagittal sinus was carefully lifted from the brain by sectioning the dura laterally and the falx inferiorly and suspending the sinus across two platinum hook electrodes for stimulation. The sinus was stimulated electrically and its effect on caudal brainstem, upper cervical spinal cord and diencephalic metabolic activity determined. Stimulation of the sinus caused increased metabolic activity in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, in the cervical dorsal horn and in a discrete area in the dorsolateral spinal cord at the second cervical segment. Metabolic activity was also increased in the ventrobasal thalamus, specifically in the ventroposteromedial (188%) nuclear group, in the medial nucleus of the posterior complex (70%) and the intralaminar complex (49%). There was no change in the surrounding thalamus, lateral geniculate nucleus or overlying cerebral cortex. These increases in 2-deoxyglucose utilisation were blocked by bilateral trigeminal ganglion ablation. The dorsolateral area activated in the spinal cord corresponds to a hitherto unrecognised group of cells in or near the lateral cervical nucleus that may form an important relay for craniovascular nociception. Further electrophysiological studies with glass coated tungsten microelectrodes have characterised the cells in these regions of the thalamus to be responsible for relaying nociceptive information. An understanding of the connections and properties of the neurons that subserve craniovascular pain is an essential prerequisite to understanding the complex pathophysiology of migraine.\r"

These criteria are derived from a study comparing the features of 100 patients with migraine without aura and 100 patients with chronic daily headache. The proposed criteria for the diagnosis of migraine without aura were highly sensitive and adequately specific in discriminating groups. These simple criteria should facilitate the diagnosis of migraine by primary care physicians.\r"

To avoid side effects a special schedule or administration is necessary. Flunarizine has no myogenic effect on smooth muscle cells of the vessles. It is said to be the only calcium antagonist able to protect brain cells against hypoxic damage. In addition, the considerable body of information which shows flunarizine capable of directly influencing the central nervous system, suggests that the drug's anti-migraine action may depend on its ability to influence central phenomena.\r"

Three paradigms were used: the first two concerned pattern-reversal VEPs with different analysis times (500 and 1500 ms), and in the third paradigm the pattern did not reverse. Power spectra were calculated for individual responses, and the delta, theta, alpha and beta areas of the averaged spectra were noted as indicators of background reactivity. Alpha and beta powers were consistently but not significantly higher in the migraine group. The difference was too small to be of value as a diagnostic test. Alpha power was (not significantly) lower in the presence of photic stimulation than in its absence. As this was the case in both groups photic stimulation does not explain the higher alpha powers in the migraine group. We conclude that EEG background activity during the VEP does not distinguish reliably between migraineurs and controls.\r"

In a third patient, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both outside and during pain paroxysms, were assessed using the standard Korotkoff method. Heart rate was found to be significantly decreased during pain paroxysms. Systolic blood pressure was observed to be significantly increased during attacks, when compared with the inter-attack period, while a less consistent pattern was observed for diastolic blood pressure. Some of the changes in the cardiovascular system seemed to start prior to pain onset. Therefore, it seems unlikely that these changes were caused by pain activation of the sympathetic nervous system or the oculocardiac reflex.\r"

The present study was undertaken in order to clarify the source of the plasma met-enkephalin increase. Recent evidence has shown that peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells contain peptides derived from the proenkephalin A system, which can be released by specific stimuli. We studied neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptides (NMECP) in 27 episodic cluster headache patients: 24 in a cluster period (6 of them during a pain attack), and 3 in the remission period. Neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptide levels (after sequential enzymatic digestion with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B) were determined by radioimmunoassay with specific antiserum. Neutrophil peptide concentration (pmol/mg prot) was lower (p less than 0.01) in patients during the pain attack (14.4 +/- 0.36) than after their pain had subsided (36.7 +/- 0.31) and lower than in the remission period patients (35.8 +/- 0.4).

  ".W": "Platelet hyperactivity, one of the commonest findings associated with migraine, has been related to increased release of biologically active substances such as catecholamines and arachidonic acid metabolites, which seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. In this study, in vitro platelet aggregation tests were performed on samples from patients with different types of headache. The presence of platelet hyperactivity was clearly demonstrated in 11 patients with classical migraine between attacks, but not in 4 patients between attacks of common migraine. Nevertheless, the presence of a marked platelet hyporesponsivity was found during the attack phase of both classical and common migraine. No difference in platelet aggregability was found between attack and post-attack phases in 5 patients with cluster headache. Blood leukotrienes were analyzed in 8 patients with classical migraine and in the 5 patients with cluster headache. During the attack phase of classical migraine both LTC4 and LTB4 were present in the peripheral blood, while the post-attack phase was characterized by the disappearance of LTC4 and the presence of LTB4 and its transisomer delta 6-trans-LTB4. Blood leukotrienes were constantly absent during both phases of cluster headache. Incubation of normal platelets with LTC4 or delta 6-trans-LTB4 was followed by inhibition of platelet response to epinephrine. delta 6-trans-LTB4, at higher concentrations, induced the opposite effect. A possible role of blood leukotrienes in the changes occurring in platelet aggregability during the different phases of classical migraine, is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Radiographic and histological studies of sixteen massive retrieved human allografts were carried out after the allografts had been in situ for four to sixty-five months. The studies demonstrated that union between the allograft and the host took place slowly at cortical-cortical junctions by the formation of an external callus derived from the cortex of the host, and it took place more rapidly at cancellous-cancellous junctions by internal callus advancing from the host into the allograft. Internal repair took place very slowly, was confined to the superficial surface and the ends of the graft, and had involved only 20 per cent of the graft by five years. The deep unrepaired portions of the graft retained their architecture, and where bone cement had been used to fix a prosthetic stem or an intramedullary rod to the allograft, there was no evidence of resorption of bone or loosening of the device. Soft tissues of the host became attached to the graft by deposition of a thin seam of new bone on the surface of the graft. A previous fracture of two grafts had healed before the time of retrieval. Analysis of the articular cartilage revealed no evidence that any chondrocytes had survived, even when the graft had been cryoprotected before it was preserved by freezing. The necrotic cartilage functioned well for as long as five years, and as it degenerated, it was covered by a pannus of fibrovascular reparative tissue. Two allografts that had been removed because of rejection were surrounded by an envelope of chronic inflammatory tissue that prevented union, adherence of soft tissue, and internal repair. Internal repair was more advanced about sites of fracture and adjacent to recurrent tumors than in other portions of the graft. These findings suggest that large frozen allografts in humans are osteoconductive rather than osteoinductive.\r"

  ".U": "91365774\r", 
  ".W": "After implantation, a massive osteochondral allograft cannot be completely protected from the stresses that are produced by weight-bearing, and it is susceptible to collapse during incorporation, revascularization, and substitution. How these processes are affected by disparities between the tissue antigens of the host and the graft remain unclear. To clarify the role of histocompatibility antigen-matching in the incorporation of cancellous and cortical bone, we orthotopically implanted both fresh and cryopreserved dog leukocyte-antigen-matched and mismatched proximal osteochondral radial allografts in beagles. Four groups of beagle dogs were used; they received (1) a dog leukocyte-antigen-mismatched frozen allograft, (2) a dog leukocyte-antigen-mismatched fresh allograft, (3) a dog leukocyte-antigen-matched fresh allograft, or (4) a dog leukocyte-antigen-matched frozen allograft. In twelve dogs, a sham operation was done in the contralateral limb (the first living donor had a sham operation), and in the remaining ten dogs, the proximal part of the contralateral radius was removed and then replaced as an autogenous (control) graft. The animals were given fluorochromes periodically, and they were killed eleven months after the operation. The osseous portion of the grafts was evaluated radiographically, biomechanically, and histomorphometrically. No dog had grossly obvious clinical abnormalities, all host-graft interfaces healed, and no joints dislocated. Radiographic examination of the allografts frequently showed deformation of the radial head and variable peripheral resorption. No significant difference in the modulus of elasticity at the host-graft interface was found among the groups. The repair process of the cortical bone was similar for all grafted segments. New periosteal and endosteal bone formed, and the cortical bone became porotic as vessels penetrated it. The uptake of fluorochrome was the most active in the autogenous grafts and the least active in the fresh antigen-mismatched grafts. The volume of cancellous bone was significantly greater and the trabeculae were thicker in all allografts compared with the bones on which a sham operation had been done and compared with the autogenous grafts. The volume of intertrabecular fibrous connective tissue was directly proportional to the immunogenicity of the allografts, and the percentage of the surface on which bone was forming tended to be inversely proportional to the immunogenicity of the allografts. The grafts were revascularized by the ingrowth of vessels into the intertrabecular spaces; necrotic trabeculae were not penetrated by vessels. This pattern was particularly pronounced in the antigen-mismatched grafts, regardless of whether they were fresh or frozen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

T-cells stimulated by allogeneic bone in vitro were collected and were characterized for state of activation, cell-surface phenotype, and antigen specificity. The stimulating antigens were determined by genetic mapping with use of recombinant inbred strains of mice and by blocking of mixed lymphocyte cultures with use of neutralizing antibodies. Purified T-cells were cultured alone or with allogeneic or syngeneic bone. In some experiments, the bone marrow was removed before in vitro culture. Responding cells were recovered after a secondary exposure to the stimulating bone. Primed cells were used immediately or cell-lines were developed. The data demonstrated that (1) allogeneic bone activated T-cells and induced their proliferation; (2) bone-induced proliferation of T-cells was specific for antigens that map to the major histocompatibility complex of the bone donor; (3) within the major histocompatibility complex, the antigens responsible for proliferation of T-cells were apparently class-I and class-II determinants; (4) removal of bone-marrow cells had no effect on the ability of that bone to stimulate alloreactivity; and (5) all of the alloreactive T-cells had the cell-surface phenotype Thy-+ CD8+ CD4-.\r"

We also evaluated the effects on the recipients when the blood was used for reinfusion. The findings in the units that had been obtained in less than four hours, in between four and six hours, and in more than six hours after the arthroplasty were similar whether or not the acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulant had been used. The mean values for the collected units were: in the blood, a concentration of hemoglobin of 115 grams per liter, a hematocrit of 0.34, a white blood-cell count of 4.8 x 10(9) per liter, and a red blood-cell count of 3.7 x 10(12) per liter, and, in the plasma, a level of hemoglobin of 160 grams per liter, a level of fibrinogen of less than 0.2 gram per liter, a level of factor-V clotting protein of less than 10 per cent of normal, a level of factor-VIII clotting protein that was 45 per cent of normal, a level of antithrombin III that was 45 per cent of normal, a level of plasminogen that was 55 per cent of normal, a level of protein C that was 100 per cent of normal, and a level of fibrin-degradation products of 1000 micrograms per milliliter of plasma. The clinical response of the patient was assessed after the reinfusion of a total of 205 units of unwashed shed blood into 153 patients. In addition, in 126 of the 153 patients, hematological and plasma-protein measurements were analyzed before the autotransfusion and one and twenty-four hours afterward. Each of these patients had received one to four units of shed blood that had been filtered but not washed. Only two (2 per cent) of the ninety-nine patients who received shed blood that had been collected six hours or less after the operation had a febrile reaction, whereas twelve (22 per cent) of the fifty-four patients who received blood that had been collected six to twelve hours after the operation had such a reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The result of the operation was regarded as a clinical failure if the patient considered it so, if an additional operation had been done, or if the functional and pain scores were not good (that is, if the patient was not able to work full time and the rating for pain was more than 5 of 10 points). Seventeen (28 per cent) of the patients were considered to have a clinical failure, with the lowest rate (20 per cent) for patients who had painful degenerative arthritis and the highest rate (47 per cent) for patients who had had a pseudarthrosis before the operation. The rate of fusion was 90 per cent in patients who had painful degenerative disease, 93 per cent in patients who had spondylolisthesis, and 65 per cent in patients who had had a pseudarthrosis preoperatively.\r"

The device has an axial-compression screw to allow compression along an axis parallel to the femoral shaft. As the fracture settles postoperatively, dynamic axial compression continues. This axial-compression device was used in twenty-five patients who had an unstable intertrochanteric or proximal subtrochanteric fracture of the proximal part of the femur. The average extent of axial impaction or settling was five millimeters (standard deviation, 1.3 millimeters) at the most recent follow-up examination, and the relationship between the femoral head and shaft was altered less than with the use of a conventional compression screw-plate device. A larger proportion of the patients who had the new device were able to walk fifteen meters (fifty feet) independently by the time of discharge from the hospital, even though they left the hospital earlier. No technical failures were seen in the patients who were treated with the axial-compression screw device. We believe that the axial-compression screw-plate device is appropriate for the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fractures of the hip.\r"

It was found to be limited by low reliability and large errors in measurement, with the metatarsophalangeal joint being the only reliable site for measurement. The vibratory thresholds at this site were significantly higher in the fourteen subjects who had scoliosis than in the twenty-two control subjects. No significant asymmetry in vibratory thresholds was found between the concave and convex or the right and left sides in either the scoliotic or the control group. Because there was no significant difference between the readings from the concave and convex sides, it is unlikely that a lesion of the posterior column is responsible for idiopathic scoliosis. If there is a difference, then the PVD Bio-Thesiometer is not sufficiently reliable to detect it.\r"

Intramedullary fixation has several advantages compared with other treatments, such as fixation with a plate and screws.

Twenty-seven patients had an excellent result; two, a good result; and one, a poor result, on the basis of pain, motion, strength, and radiographic appearance. Complications were rare, and there was no loss of fixation of the pins. The average grip strength was 92 per cent of normal. Motion of the wrist and rotation of the forearm averaged more than 90 per cent of that of the normal side. Carpal height was used as an indicator of distraction force produced by the fixator. There was an average increase in carpal height of four millimeters initially and 3.7 millimeters immediately before removal of the fixator, indicating near-constant distraction throughout the treatment. Radial length was well maintained, with shortening averaging less than one millimeter. The converging pins of the AO fixator prevent loosening, thereby diminishing the risks of infection, loss of reduction of the fracture, and breakage of the pins. This geometry of the pins allows the use of smaller-diameter (2.5-millimeter) pins and provides rigid fixation, even in osteoporotic bone.\r"

  ".U": "91365817\r", 
  ".W": "In some subjects with hypoglycemia associated with tumors of mesenchymal origin, high insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) levels have been described in serum and in the tumors. Tumor IGF-II of 10-15 kDa circulates in a 60-kDa complex, in contrast to the ternary 150-kDa complex in which serum IGFs normally circulate together with the IGF-binding subunit (IGFBP-3) and the acid-labile subunit (alpha-subunit). This study examines the molecular distribution and complex-forming activity of the components of the ternary complex in the serum of subjects with mesenchymal tumor hypoglycemia. Total serum IGFBP-3 levels were 60% of normal in tumor patients and appeared at 60 kDa on gel chromatography, shifting after tumor removal to 150 kDa. Total alpha-subunit levels were 40% of normal in patients with tumors, increasing after tumor removal to 70% of normal and changing in elution profile from a peak typical of uncomplexed alpha-subunit to the normal broad peak representing both complexed and uncomplexed alpha-subunit. Although low by RIA, alpha-subunit activity in a ternary complex formation assay was normal, indicating that the ability of free alpha-subunit in the patients' circulation to combine with exogenous IGFBP-3 plus IGF-I was not impaired. In contrast, in an assay that tested the ability of IGF-IGFBP complexes in the patients' circulation to combine with pure alpha-subunit, complex formation activity was 75-85% below normal in preoperative sera, despite low normal IGFBP-3 levels. Therefore, the cause of hypoglycemia in these patients may be the inability of complexes between the abnormal tumor IGF-II and IGFBP-3 to be sequestered in the biologically inactive ternary complex.\r"

  ".W": "The sulfated conjugate of T3 (T3S) has long been recognized as a normal product of peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism. In order to better understand the role that T3S may play in this process, the metabolic handling of T3S was studied in euthyroid man. After the iv administration of [125I]T3S in man, T3S was found to be rapidly metabolized with estimated mean MCR of 135 +/- 15 liters/day (L/D) after a bolus injection and 127 +/- 8 L/D employing a constant infusion. The primary route of T3S disposal was by deiodination with an efficiency of 92%. The administration of propylthiouracil (PTU, 300 mg every 6 h x 5 days) and iopanoic acid (IA, 500 mg every day x 5 days), both inhibitors of deiodination, decreased clearance compared to control (87 +/- 9 L/D, P less than 0.01 and 46 +/- 10 L/D, P less than 0.002, respectively). A 3-day fast also reduced the clearance of T3S (56 +/- 10 L/D, P less than 0.002). All three maneuvers decreased the total urinary deiodination fraction of tracer T3S (control 91 +/- 2%, PTU 70 +/- 9%, P less than 0.04, IA 26 +/- 3%, P less than 0.0001, and fasting 58 +/- 6%, P less than 0.01). A strong correlation between T3S clearance and deiodination was noted for fasting and IA only (r = 0.78, P less than 0.003). However, no relationship between clearance and deiodination was noted with PTU administration presumably as a result of a compensatory increase in biliary losses of T3S. The urinary thyronine excretion pattern demonstrated the presence of small amounts of labeled T3,3,3'-T2, and 3,3'-T2S with the major metabolite being T3S itself. TSH levels were not influenced by the infusion of stable T3S designed to achieve a serum value greater than 50 ng/dL. No absorption of intact T3S was detected after its oral ingestion. In conclusion, T3S is rapidly cleared from the serum, primarily by deiodination, may undergo nondeiodinative disposal when hepatic deiodination is inhibited by PTU but not with IA or fasting, and has no intrinsic biological activity. Thus, T3S may serve as a metabolite of T3 for its rapid deiodinative disposal. Although the precise role T3S plays in human thyroid hormone metabolism has not been defined, the metabolic characteristics of T3S appear similar to that of an unidentified alternate T4 metabolite formed in low T3 states of fasting and nonthyroidal illness.\r"

In striking contrast, in trypsin treated cells the cAMP stimulation by both human TSH (hTSH) and thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSab) was unimpaired, indicating a similar behavior for these two stimulators. The effect of trypsin on inhibiting cAMP stimulation by bTSH was: 1) dose dependent; 2) present at a trypsin concentration as low as 3.3 mg/L; 3) fully reversible within 24 h after removal of the enzyme. In accordance with the altered biological activity in human thyroid cells exposed to trypsin the binding of labeled bTSH was reduced (about 40%). On the contrary, in the same cells, the binding of labeled human TSH was enhanced (about 3-fold). The cAMP response to cholera toxin and forskolin was unaffected in trypsin treated cells, indicating that the tryptic treatment did not alter any other component of the adenylate cyclase complex. The medium obtained from trypsin-treated human thyroid cells was able to neutralize the biological activity of bTSH but not that of hTSH or TSab. Our study demonstrates that in human thyroid cells: 1) trypsin impaires bovine, but not human TSH or TSab biological activity; 2) bovine and human TSH may bind to different components of the TSH receptor.\r"

  ".U": "91365820\r", 
  ".W": "The cellular distribution of the aromatase cytochrome P-450 enzyme in human ovaries has been investigated immunocytochemically, using an aromatase-specific monoclonal antibody. Ovaries of females ranging in age from prepubertal infant girl through to postmenopausal adulthood were obtained from immediate autopsy or after surgery. The results have revealed temporal and spatial changes in expression of aromatase at different stages of development. No immunoreactive aromatase was detected in the ovary of the 2.5 month infant. In premenopausal ovaries, aromatase was absent from the stromal compartment, but in follicles, a consistent pattern in expression of aromatase was observed, related to their size and developmental stage. Aromatase was not expressed in primordial, primary, or small secondary follicles less than 250 microns diameter. In slightly larger follicles (250-700 microns diameter) aromatase was first detected in a few thecal cells (TC). In more developed secondary through to large preovulatory follicles (greater than 1 cm) TC aromatase immunostain increased in intensity and number of positive cells, and the reaction was localized to a band of theca interna (TI) cells at the TI/theca externa interface. In granulosa cells (GC), aromatase was first detected in follicles in the initial stages of antrum formation (greater than 700 microns), and staining intensified as follicle diameter and antral cavity increased, being maximal in preovulatory follicles. GC aromatase was always found in the presence of TI immunostain. These two cell populations were separated by an unstained layer of TI cells giving the follicle walls a banded appearance. Immunostain was most intense in mural GC, was weaker in antral GC cells and was absent from the cumulus GC. Immunoreactive aromatase was also detected in functional corpora lutea (CL) but was absent from involuting CL's and corpora albicans. Our findings indicate that the immunostained cells of the CL are comprised of the former GC and possibly a subpopulation of former TI cells. In perimenopausal ovaries there was no evidence of any follicular or stromal aromatase immunostain. In postmenopausal ovaries no follicles were observed, but individual cells and clusters of cells in the stromal compartment of 3/7 specimens were found to have an aromatase immunostain reaction. In all cases, the aromatase immunostain reaction was cytoplasmic. The results provide the first direct evidence of the existence of TC aromatase, and of stromal cell aromatase in postmenopausal women.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) is one of a family of IGFBPs that are present in extracellular fluids, and binds both IGF-II and IGF-I with high affinity. These studies were conducted to determine the nutritional and hormonal variables that regulate plasma IGFBP-2 concentrations in humans. The mean plasma IGFBP-2 concentration for 38 normal adult subjects was 150 +/- 61 micrograms/L and was 4.7-fold greater than their mean fasting IGFBP-1 value. Mean IGFBP-2 values in cord sera of 26 normal term infants was 3.8-fold greater than the normal adult mean value. Likewise, the mean value for 44 hypopituitary adults was increased 2-fold compared to normal. There was no suppression of IGFBP-2 values in acromegaly. Normal adult subjects showed minimal fluctuations (less than 2-fold changes) in plasma IGFBP-2 concentrations during a 48-h sampling period. These changes were significantly less than the changes that occurred in plasma IGFBP-1 during the same interval. Plasma IGFBP-2 did not change significantly post prandially or after a glucose infusion. Extreme insulin deficiency, after 9 days of fasting, was associated with a 1.7-fold increase in plasma IGFBP-2. Administration of GH, which is known to cause a major decrease in plasma IGFBP-1 and in IGFBP-2 in hypophysectomized animals, did not result in a change in calorically restricted normal adult subjects, suggesting that a normal caloric intake is required for GH to suppress IGFBP-2. In summary, these results show that plasma IGFBP-2 is regulated differently than IGFBP-1. Acute stimulation of insulin secretion does not suppress IGFBP-2, and there is much less daily fluctuation compared to IGFBP-1. These findings suggest that plasma IGFBP-2 levels are more stable than IGFBP-1, and therefore IGFBP-2 may serve as a larger reservior that is available for IGF transport.\r"

Heat shock proteins (HSPs), synthesized by cells undergoing stress, function to maintain cellular homeostasis and are probably involved in the intracellular processing and cell surface presentation of antigens. We investigated possible differences in the expression of 70-kDa HSPs between cultured fibroblasts obtained from patients with severe GO and normal individuals. In addition, we compared HSP expression in fibroblasts derived from tissues involved in the extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease (GO and PTM) with that in fibroblasts from uninvolved tissues. HSPs were detected by both immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence, using monoclonal antibodies that are directed against HSP72, HSP72/73 (termed HSP70), and HSP90. HSP expression at baseline and after treatment with various cytokines and heat stress was examined. At baseline, HSP72 reactivity was exclusively detected in retroocular and pretibial fibroblasts from patients with severe GO and PTM, but was not observed in abdominal fibroblasts from these patients and was not detectable in fibroblasts from any anatomical site of normal individuals. The abundance of HSP70 expression at baseline and after treatment with certain cytokines was significantly greater in retroocular and pretibial fibroblasts from patients with GO than in normal individuals. In addition, characteristic changes in the cellular localization of HSPs before and after exposure to heat stress and cytokines were observed; cell surface expression of HSP70 was detected at baseline in fibroblasts from patients, but not in normal fibroblasts. These data provide the first evidence that HSPs are differentially expressed by fibroblasts derived from tissues affected by the extrathyroidal manifestations of GD. These proteins may have a role in localized immune processes, leading to the development of GO and PTM.\r"

In this study we examined the tissue levels of CSF-1 by RIA and the relative expression of CSF-1 and c-fms mRNA by Northern blot analysis in human endometrial, decidual, and placental tissues during the normal menstrual cycle and early pregnancy. All endometrial, decidual, and placental tissues demonstrated extractable immunoreactive CSF-1 and expressed the 4.0-kilobase CSF-1 mRNA species. First trimester decidual tissue expressed higher levels of CSF-1 mRNA than proliferative (3.2-fold higher; P less than 0.01) or secretory (2.4-fold higher; P less than 0.01) endometrial tissues, whereas proliferative and secretory endometrial tissues expressed similar levels of CSF-1 mRNA. Tissue extractable levels of immunoreactive CSF-1 were 3.2-fold (P less than 0.05) higher in first trimester decidual tissue and 2.9-fold (P less than 0.05) higher in secretory endometrial tissue compared to levels in proliferative endometrial tissue, whereas first trimester decidua and secretory endometrial tissues had similar levels of immunoreactive CSF-1. There was expression of c-fms mRNA in all endometrial and first trimester decidual tissue samples, with little change during the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy. In placenta, there was a positive correlation of increasing CSF-1 and c-fms mRNA expression with increasing gestational age. These results suggest that there is increased local production of CSF-1 in tissues found at the maternal-fetal interface during the time of implantation and early pregnancy. This increased production of CSF-1 may play a role in decidual function and placental growth through the presence of c-fms in these tissues.\r"

Results included raised basal serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, and urinary free cortisol; failure to suppress even a paradoxical rise in serum cortisol after dexamethasone (1 mg overnight, 2, 8, and 16 mg/day); and a definite but not exaggerated rise in 11-deoxycortisol after metyrapone. After iv CRF, plasma ACTH rose from 22 to 30 pmol/L. Abdominal computed tomographic scanning showed adrenal hyperplasia; the presence of an adrenal adenoma, although suspected, was not established. An unusual finding was the presence in the urine of large amounts of 21-deoxycortisol metabolites, including 3 alpha,11 beta,17 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one and 5 beta-pregnane 3 alpha,11 beta,17 alpha,20 alpha-tetrol. On the basis of preoperative biochemical/radiological findings, a provisional diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome associated with autonomous bilateral adrenal hyperplasia was made. Incomplete bilateral adrenalectomy was performed; adrenal hyperplasia was histologically confirmed, but no tumor was found. However, ACTH was measured 1) just before operation when the patient was receiving treatment with metyrapone, and 2) postoperatively when the patient was receiving steroid replacement only, and on these occasions ACTH levels were lower than during the initial investigations. Pituitary scans before and after adrenalectomy were similar, offering no evidence of pituitary infarction. We propose that abnormal production of 21-deoxycortisol contributed to the aberrant regulation of ACTH and cortisol in this case, providing an example of a previously unreported cause of hypercortisolemia.\r"

To test this idea we perform oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) in six lean and eight obese subjects, measuring glucose and insulin levels. Afterward two insulin infusion studies were performed. During infusion study I, insulin was infused in a dynamic square wave fashion to mimic the individual post-OGTT insulin levels at content euglycemic glucose levels. During study II, glucose and insulin infusions were varied to mimic post-OGTT levels in each subject. Overall glucose turnover was measured isotopically by infusion of [3-3H] glucose. During the OGTT the obese subjects exhibited significantly higher insulin (P less than 0.005) and glucose levels (P less than 0.002). Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rates and total incremental glucose disposal (IGD) over 4 h during study I at euglycemia were significantly lower in obese compared to lean subjects (area under the curve, 824 +/- 166 vs. 1222 +/- 161 mmol/L.m2; P less than 0.01) despite higher post-OGTT insulin levels in obese subjects. When insulin plus glucose levels were matched to the individual OGTT levels, IGD was not significantly different between obese and control subjects (1712 +/- 253 vs. 1617 +/- 444 mmol/L.m2; P = NS). A significant inverse correlation (r = -0.73; P less than 0.05) existed between the degree of glucose intolerance (OGTT) and the decrease in IGD during the phasic hyperinsulinemic euglycemic study (infusion study I). These data suggest that with increasing insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia is less effective in compensating for this decrease in insulin action, and hyperglycemia becomes more important in augmenting overall glucose disposal values.\r"

Four rhesus monkeys had been prepared for chronic remote iv and ivt infusions as well as blood sampling from the adjacent room. Statistical evaluation used a two-way analysis of variance and individual comparisons with Tukey's Studentized range test. The GH response (area under the curve +/- SE) to IHG was significantly reduced by a concomitant ivt glucose infusion (control, 1.0 +/- 0.1; IHG, 12.1 +/- 3.3; IHG plus ivt glucose, 7.0 +/- 1.2 microgram/L.120 min). The GH response to FFA depression was significantly reduced by ivt Ol-Ac or beta OHB infusion (control, 6.0 +/- 1.0; NA, 51.5 +/- 4.1; Na plus Ol-Ac, 81.2 +/- 1.3; NA plus beta OHB, 38.6 +/- 3.5 microgram/L.300 min). Introcerebroventricular infusions of glucose, Ol-Ac, or beta OHB alone had no effect on plasma GH, glucose, FFA, or beta OHB concentrations. These results provide evidence for a hypothalamic site of metabolic modulation of GH secretion in the rhesus monkey. This does not exclude an additional effect directly at the pituitary gland.\r"

Serum GH-BP reflects the amount of GH receptors, and the liver seems to be their main source. To evaluate the effect of liver disease on GH-BP, 52 patients with liver cirrhosis were studied. Serum GH-BP was measured by a binding assay with dextran-coated charcoal separation. Levels of GH-BP were correlated against the clinical state, assessed by Pugh's score. The GH-BP of 31 Pugh's class A patients was 9.7 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum, and that of 21 Pugh's class B and C patients was 7.2 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum compared to 11.3 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum in age-matched controls. GH-BP correlated negatively with Pugh's score and serum bilirubin, and positively with serum albumin. It did not correlate with serum liver enzymes or serum insulin-like growth factor-I. Scatchard analysis of GH binding to the GH-BP revealed similar binding affinities in Pugh's A, B, and C patients and controls. The binding capacity in cirrhosis was significantly lower than that in controls. We conclude that serum GH-BP is controlled mainly by the liver and can provide an additional measure of disease severity in liver cirrhosis.\r"

Accordingly, seven normal weight, ovulatory women were randomized to receive first either a 75 g glucose dose or a sham control for diurnal rhythm consisting of distilled water at 1700 h. After this insulin stimulus, DHEA-S suppressed below sham control at 90 and 120 min (P less than 0.05) whereas delta 4A suppress at 60, 90, and 120 min (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, as serum insulin increased after glucose, DHEA-S (r2 = 0.351, P less than 0.05) and delta 4A (r2 = 0.314, P less than 0.05) decreased in an inverse linear relationship with insulin. There was no significant suppression below sham at any point in time for DHEA, testosterone, or cortisol. Thus, the endogenous serum insulin response after oral glucose in normal women is associated with suppression of serum DHEA-S and delta 4A with absence of testosterone and cortisol suppression.\r"

This enzyme, when added to cell cultures for 24 h in vitro stimulates collagen synthesis and the production of alkaline phosphatase. The effects are dose dependent, with statistically significant effects occurring from 0.1-100 nM hPAP. Concentrations higher than 100 nM do not evoke greater effects. The maximal effect of hPAP occurs between 12 and 24 h of exposure. The cells stimulated to the greatest degree are osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblasts. Fibroblasts isolated from the same tissue show a lesser sensitivity to hPAP. hPAP has no detectable effect on cell proliferation, as measured by radiolabeled thymidine incorporation or total DNA synthesis. None of the observations reported in this work can be attributed to contaminating proteins in the hPAP preparation. hPAP was radiolabeled with 125I and was used for affinity binding and cross-linking studies. Scatchard analysis of specific binding indicated the presence of 1.0 X 10(5) high affinity binding sites/cell, with a Kd of 6.5 nM. Cross-linking studies demonstrated the presence of one 320-kDa binding complex. The pH profile and kinetic determinations of Km and maximum velocity for hPAP were similar to those previously reported, except for the finding of positive cooperativity of the substrate with the enzyme under the conditions of our assay. We believe that the direct stimulation of bone-forming cells by hPAP may contribute to the sclerotic nature of skeletal bone around sites of neoplastic prostatic metastases and that the effect of the enzyme is probably mediated by a plasma membrane receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Pregnant rhesus monkeys exhibit diurnal changes in uterine activity (UA), with episodes of increased UA during the early hours of darkness. The estrogenic environment during late pregnancy serves a permissive role in the maintenance of nocturnal UA episodes and may involve myometrial interactions with oxytocin (OT) and/or alpha-adrenergic stimuli. In the present study we have used chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus monkeys to measure diurnal changes in maternal plasma OT, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. We also determined the effects of infusing an OT antagonist (ORF 22164) and the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine on nocturnal UA episodes. Animals were exposed to a 16-h light, 8-h dark photo-period, with the hours of darkness between 2300-0700 h. Maternal plasma samples were collected at 3-h intervals for 36 h and analyzed by RIA for OT and by high performance liquid chromatography for catecholamines. Plasma OT was correlated with UA in animals that displayed nocturnal UA episodes (r = 0.76; P less than 0.01). Maximal OT concentrations occurred at 2400 h in these animals; plasma OT was higher during the hours of darkness compared to levels during the light phase (10.4 +/- 1.9 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 pmol/L, respectively; n = 4). Some animals did not display nocturnal episodes of increased UA and showed no increase in OT concentrations during the hours of darkness. Maternal plasma catecholamine concentrations were not correlated with nocturnal UA and were maximal during the light phase. Nocturnal UA was abolished within 30 min of infusion of the OT antagonist, but phentolamine infusions had no effect on nocturnal UA. We conclude that 1) changes in maternal plasma catecholamine concentrations are not involved in the generation of nocturnal UA; 2) the presence of episodes of increased UA at night results from increased maternal plasma OT concentrations; and 3) the absence of nocturnal UA in some animals can be explained by a reduced level of OT secretion.\r"

Mutations in each of the three ras genes (K-ras, H-ras, and N-ras) have been identified in many human neoplasms, including thyroid cancer. In this study we examined genomic DNA from benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms for mutations that are known to activate the ras oncogenes (codons 12, 13, and 61). DNA from frozen surgically excised tissue (n = 8) and from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (n = 30) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations using oligonucleotide-specific hybridization. No mutations were identified in follicular adenomas (n = 9). In follicular carcinomas, 2 of 14 tumors contained mutations (N-ras 61, Gln to Arg), and both of these patients had bone metastases. One of 15 papillary carcinomas had a ras mutation (H-ras 12, Gly to Ser). In contrast to other studies, we found that ras mutations are relatively uncommon in both benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. Studies of larger numbers of tumors and comparisons of different patient populations will be required to assess a possible association of mutations in N-ras 61 with clinically aggressive follicular cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Dihydrospirorenone (DHSP; 6 beta,7 beta,15 beta,16 beta-dimethylen-3-oxo-17- alpha-pregn-4-en-21,17-carbolacton) is an aldosterone antagonist 8 times as potent as spironolactone in the rat. It is also a progestogen that suppresses ovulation in normal women at a daily dosage of 2 mg. The effects of this dosage on the renin-aldosterone system and sodium and potassium balances were investigated in two experiments. In study I, 12 healthy women received a diet with 100 mmol sodium and 60-70 mmol potassium per day from days 3-13 of their normal menstrual cycles. Six women took 2 mg DHSP; 6 others received placebo from days 8-13 of the cycle. Sodium excretion in the DHSP group rose from a mean of 79 to 98.5 +/- 8.3 mmol/day during medication. Placebo had no effect. The difference between average sodium excretion rates in subjects treated with DHSP or placebo was close to significance (P = 0.053). Potassium excretion did not change. Weight loss was slightly greater after DHSP than placebo treatment. PRA and plasma and urinary aldosterone rose significantly during DHSP medication. In study II, 12 women on a free diet were studied during a control and a treatment cyle. From days 5-25 of the second cycle, they took 2 mg DHSP (n = 6) or 1 mg cyproterone acetate. Both compounds suppressed ovulation and the rise in progesterone. During cycle 1, sodium excretion, PRA, and aldosterone were higher in the luteal than in the follicular phase, probably due to an antialdosterone effect of progesterone. DHSP reversed this pattern of natriuresis by inducing a significant early natriuresis and a rise in PRA and aldosterone. Cyproterone acetate only abolished differences in natriuresis between the follicular and luteal phases and the rise of PRA and plasma aldosterone in the luteal phase. We conclude that DHSP may be a suitable partner of ethinyl estradiol as a constituent of an oral contraceptive, since its progestogenic and antialdosterone profile is similar to that of progesterone. Other synthetic progestogens are devoid of an antialdosterone effect. The antialdosterone effect of DHSP may help prevent sodium retention and a rise in blood pressure in susceptible women.\r"

  ".W": "The recent availability of a Tyr3-substituted octreotide (SDZ 204-090) for radioiodination has allowed somatostatin (SRIH) receptor binding to be studied in vivo, and receptor-positive tumors of different origins to be visualized with a gamma-camera. This prompted us to investigate whether this compound could be used for external imaging of functionless pituitary adenomas displaying SRIH receptors. Eight patients with functionless pituitary adenomas, three patients with acromegaly, and three with macroprolactinoma were injected iv with 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide and then scanned with a gamma-camera. Positive scans were obtained in the three acromegalics and in two of the eight patients with functionless pituitary tumors. The patients with macroprolactinoma had negative scans. The diagnosis of functionless pituitary adenomas was confirmed by light and electron microscopic examination as well as immunocytochemical studies. In vitro binding of [125I]Tyr11-SRIH to cell membranes was evaluated in four functionless and three GH-secreting adenomas removed from seven of the patients. All of the GH-secreting as well as one of the four functionless adenomas had high affinity SRIH-binding sites, without differences in number or affinity, whereas SRIH-binding sites were not detected in the others. Positive scans were observed only in patients bearing tumors with high affinity SRIH-binding sites. In conclusion, [123I]Tyr3-octreotide appears to be a promising tool for singling out, in vivo, patients with functionless pituitary tumors displaying SRIH receptors who might potentially benefit from octreotide treatment.\r"

Previous studies led to the isolation of two overlapping cDNA clones that encode polypeptides of TPO (85 residues, C2; 100 residues, C21) recognized by sera from several patients with autoimmune disease that contained antimicrosomal autoantibodies. In this report the vector pUEX1 was used to clone and express small random fragments of TPO cDNA in Escherichia coli as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Colonies were screened with a serum from a patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and immunoreactive peptides were identified by sequencing the corresponding DNA inserts. Two linear epitopes of human TPO (amino acids 590-622 and 710-722) were recognized by the autoantibodies. This confirmed our previous results and provide a more precise localization of the antigenic determinants involved. The same approach has been applied in an attempt to identify the binding site(s) for autoantibodies on the human TSH receptor. In contrast to the data obtained with TPO, sera from patients with blocking (from idiopathic myxoedema) or stimulating (from Graves' disease) activity did not recognize the linear TSH receptor peptide fragments generated in our libraries.\r"

In this study we have tested that assumption by using a radioisotope dilution technique to measure norepinephrine (NE) kinetics in arterialized plasma after administration of oral yohimbine (20 or 40 mg) or placebo to normal young men. In agreement with previous studies, we found that yohimbine causes dose-dependent increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma NE. We further found that the increase in plasma NE is, in fact, due to an increase in the rate of appearance of NE into plasma and not to reduced NE clearance from plasma. In addition, we found that yohimbine causes a dose-dependent increase in plasma epinephrine, which had not been found in studies measuring catecholamines in venous plasma. We conclude that yohimbine increases plasma NE levels by increasing the rate of NE release from sympathetic nerves, and probably increases epinephrine release from the adrenals.\r"

  ".W": "Pima Indians have the highest reported prevalence rate of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in the world, so that metabolic comparisons with caucasians, who have a much lower rate, should provide insights into the pathogenesis of NIDDM. We have compared 81 caucasians with 211 Pima Indian nondiabetic subjects similar in age, sex, degree of obesity, and glucose tolerance. During a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp at physiological insulin concentrations, Pima Indians were 17% more insulin resistant than caucasians after accounting for any differences in degree of obesity (P less than 0.0001). During oral glucose tolerance testing, mean plasma insulin concentrations were 33% higher in the Pimas (P less than 0.0001), but these differences were largely explained by the greater insulin resistance in the Pimas. Insulin clearance did not differ between the races. However, early insulin responses were exaggerated in the Indians and not explained by insulin resistance. After accounting for differences in insulin action, plasma insulin concentrations in Pima Indians were 50% higher than those in caucasians 3-5 min after iv glucose (P less than 0.0001), 38% higher 10 min after the end of a meal (P less than 0.0001), and 20% higher 30 min after an oral glucose load (P less than 0.006). These data suggest that in addition to insulin resistance, Pima Indians have exaggerated early insulin release and either increased beta-cell mass or enhanced beta-cell sensitivity to glucose. The data argue against low or delayed insulin secretion as primary factors leading to NIDDM in Pima Indians and favor insulin resistance as the underlying and initiating cause of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was localized immunohistochemically in human endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle, in gestational decidua, and in first, second, and third trimester placenta using two polyclonal antihuman EGF antisera. In proliferative phase endometrium, moderate EGF immunostaining was localized to the cytoplasm of stromal cells, with absent to light staining of glandular epithelium. In the secretory phase, EGF immunostaining was intense and localized predominantly to stromal cells, particularly those surrounding spiral arterioles. There was absent to light EGF immunostaining within epithelial cells; however, there was no staining of subnuclear vacuoles. In addition, the luminal surface of exhausted secretory glands demonstrated moderate EGF immunostaining. In gestational decidua, EGF immunostaining was light to moderate in the stromal cells, but was intense in the surface epithelium. Intense EGF immunostaining was noted in the syncytiotrophoblast layer of first trimester placenta, with light to moderate staining of the cytotrophoblast. Immunostaining decreased in both layers of trophoblast as pregnancy progressed. Immunoreactive EGF is found in endometrium and trophoblast and may have a physiological role in endometrial and placental function.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of insulin and glucose on the glycogen content of isolated trophoblast cells was measured for the first time. The cells were obtained by tryptic digestion of villous tissue from term placentae of 15 healthy women, further purified on a Percoll gradient and enriched by employing a monoclonal anti HLA class-I antibody. The cells stained intensively with PKK1 and exhibited the structural and phenotypical characteristics of intermediate and syncytiotrophoblasts. The mean glycogen content of cells cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with 5.5 mM glucose was 17.7 +/- 3.2 micrograms/mg protein, remained constant from days 1-4, and was unaltered by higher glucose concentrations (17 and 28 mM) in the medium. Between 2-5 h after a medium change, the cells contained 50% more glycogen than at the time of replacement. Short term (0-5 h) as well as long term incubations (24 h) with both pathological (10(-8) M) and physiological (10(-9) M) concentrations of insulin had no effect, with respect to either the rate of increase in glycogen or the maximum level. We conclude that the glycogen content of isolated syncytiotrophoblasts in vitro is invariant to extracellular glucose concentrations and is not regulated by insulin. This suggests that cells other than syncytiotrophoblasts and their immediate precursors account for the reported alterations of glycogen content in normal human term placenta in vitro under hyperglycemic or hyperinsulinemic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin resistance is frequently associated with acanthosis nigricans and hyperandrogenism. In patients with type A insulin resistance, this has been shown to be due to genetic defects in insulin receptor function. However, other patients with a similar clinical syndrome have been reported to have a variant of this syndrome, in which assays of insulin receptor function were normal. We have sequenced a portion of the insulin receptor gene in one such patient, a 29-yr-old woman with obesity and insulin resistance. The patient is heterozygous for a mutation substituting isoleucine for methionine at position 1153. Met1153 is located in the intracellular domain of the receptor near the cluster of tyrosine phosphorylation sites at positions 1158, 1162, and 1163. Studies of the mutant receptor expressed in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that the Ile1153-mutation impairs the ability of insulin to stimulate autophosphorylation of solubilized insulin receptors. In addition, the mutation impairs the ability of insulin to stimulate receptor tyrosine kinase activity to phosphorylate an artificial substrate [poly(Glu-Tyr)]. It seems likely that this defect in receptor tyrosine kinase activity explains the defect in the ability of the patient's insulin receptors to mediate insulin action in vivo. Furthermore, this patient provides a paradigm in which genetic factors act in concert with other risk factors, such as obesity, to cause clinically important insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Large variations in nutritional intake have profound effects on the GH-insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis in children and adults, but the effect of normal variations in nutrition on IGF-I concentrations is largely unstudied, particularly during puberty. We measured serum IGF-I concentrations in 325 sixth and seventh grade girls (12.4 +/- 0.7 yr) at the beginning of a multisite school-based health curriculum. The mean serum IGF-I level among the 243 girls with complete data was 573 +/- 244 micrograms/L. Pubertal stage was significantly associated with IGF-I (P less than 0.0001, by analysis of variance). Mean concentrations rose from 427 +/- 198 micrograms/L among those at the earliest pubertal stages to 639 +/- 219 micrograms/L among the mature girls. After adjusting for the association with the stage of pubertal development, serum IGF-I was not significantly associated with measures of body composition (body mass index, triceps skin fold thickness, waist/hip ratio, height, and weight). Additionally, IGF-I concentrations were not associated with nutritional intake (total calories, total protein, total fat, and total carbohydrate) or such measures of nutrition as serum iron, hemoglobin, red cell mean corpuscular volume, white cell count, and cholesterol. IGF-I concentrations, however, were significantly correlated with transferrin concentrations, another possible index of nutritional status (r = 0.29; P less than 0.0001). IGF-I is not a clinically useful index of nutritional status among normal pubertal girls.\r"

Determination of the nucleotide sequences of 18 clones recognized by monoclonal antibody 47 localized its epitope to 9 amino acids (residues 713-721) in the human TPO protein. On Western blot analysis, only TPO monoclonal antibody 47 recognized the 933-amino acid TPO molecule after denaturation and reduction of the latter, supporting the concept that the major part of the epitope is represented by a continuous portion of the TPO sequence. The binding of TPO monoclonal antibody 47 to native TPO is inhibited by immunoglobulin G in the serum of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. The epitope for monoclonal antibody 47 defined in the present study is, therefore, part of or in the vicinity of an epitope for autoimmune thyroid disease-associated TPO antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty eight out of 170 consecutive cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were examined. They were of T cell origin, with the following distribution: seven (28%) cases had pre-T or prothymic features; nine (36%) cases showed early thymocytic features, six (24%) had cortical features; and three (12%) had a \"mature\" phenotype. The remaining three cases could not be sub-classified. A striking finding was that pre-T ALL differed from intrathymic ALL not only in the absence of both E rosettes and intrathymic differentiation antigens, but also in the expression of two non-lineage specific antigens HLA-DR and CD10. Both antigens appear in the bone marrow from the very first stages of lymphoid differentiation, implying that the origin for pre-T ALL is bone marrow. A comparison of the clinical features of pre-T and thymic ALL showed that pre-T ALL disease showed a pattern more similar to non-T ALL disease: a lower incidence of mediastinal mass, absence of extrahaematopoietic disease, lower white cell counts and haemoglobin concentrations, and a higher incidence of bone pain. No obvious difference in response to treatment was apparent. The results show that T-ALL is not only a heterogeneous immunological group but also suggest that it may have different origins: bone marrow for pre-T ALL and the thymus for thymic ALL.\r"

This neoplasm was found to have a distinctive antigenic profile, being negative for CD3 and elastase, but positive for CD43 and CD68. This immunological phenotype, coupled with its characteristic morphological features, should facilitate the recognition of this rare neoplasm in routinely processed tissue. Furthermore, the term \"plasmacytoid monocyte sarcoma\" is proposed to designate it because it is inappropriate to refer to it as a lymphoma. As all cases have been associated with a myeloproliferative disorder (usually an acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia), these tumours probably represent the accumulation in lymphoid tissue of neoplastic cells which have differentiated along the plasmacytoid monocyte pathway.\r"

  ".U": "91365903\r", 
  ".W": "Using a newly established HTLV-1 positive T cell line as an immunogen, a new monoclonal antibody, Ber-ACT8, was produced. It reacts with in vitro activated T cells and a small subset of normal resting T cells, but not with resting B cells or any of the 29 established human permanent cell lines tested. Immunohistological analysis of a wide spectrum of human tissues showed that Ber-ACT8 reactivity is restricted to a few T cells in the peripheral blood, the extrafollicular areas of lymph nodes and tonsils, and splenic red pulp. In the gut Ber-ACT8 labelled most intraepithelial T cells and up to 50% of lamina propria T cells. The antibody also immunostained T cells present in the oral and bronchial mucosa. Double labelling on splenic cells, fresh blood lymphocytes, and in vitro activated T cells showed that most Ber-ACT8 positive cells coexpressed CD8. Ber-ACT8 did not react with any of the 14 Hodgkin's lymphomas nor any of the 172 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas tested, with the exception of 10 cases of T cell lymphomas, five of which were located in the jejunum and associated with coeliac disease, and one B cell lymphoma, and most cases of hairy cell leukaemia tested. Parallel immunostainings with Ber-ACT8, anti-TCR-beta (beta F1), and anti-TCR-delta showed that most Ber-ACT8 positive T cells carry the TCR of alpha beta type. Comparison of Ber-ACT8 with HML-1, B-ly7, and LF61 showed essentially the same reactivity and an identical molecular target. The molecular structure recognised seems to be a trimeric molecule with components of 150, 125 and 105 kilodaltons, with the Ber-ACT8 epitope localised on the 150 kilodalton chain. The 150 kilodalton molecule contains an 0-linked carbohydrate moiety of about 10 kilodaltons. Because of its very selective distribution, the trimeric antigen is a powerful reagent for the diagnosis of gut T cell-derived T cell lymphomas and other extranodal T cell lymphomas, as well as hairy cell leukaemia.\r"

  ".W": "A new monoclonal antibody to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), PC10, which can be used on routinely processed tissue, was applied to 93 cases of gastric carcinoma. Significant intra-tumoural variation in staining occurred. In addition to a PCNA index (percentage of positive cells per 1000 tumour cells), a semiquantitative PCNA grading system was devised, based on estimates of less than or more than 50% of positive tumour cells in whole sections. Neither PCNA index nor PCNA grade showed any correlation with established histological variables, tumour stage, or the presence of lymph node metastases. No significant correlation was observed between PCNA index and S + G2M phase fraction measured by flow cytometric analysis. To analyse survival tumours with PCNA indices above and below the median level (41%) were compared. Those with a higher index tended to have a worse prognosis, but when PCNA grade was considered, it was found to have definite independent prognostic value, tumours of low grade surviving better than those of high grade. The ability of semiquantitative PCNA grading to allow for intra-tumoural variation suggests it may have advantages over absolute counting, which is prone to sampling error when tumour heterogeneity is a major factor. The prognostic value of PC10 staining in gastric carcinoma is therefore promising.\r"

The wider reactivity of AE1/AE3, lu-5, and MFN 116, which includes cytokeratins 8,18 (Moll's catalogue) expressed in simple epithelia and their tumours, as well as cytokeratins expressed in complex stratified squamous epithelia, permits identification of a wider range of epithelial derived tumours.

Three hundred and fifty two extracts from 349 consecutive primary isolation plates were assayed by both methods. Reverse passive haemagglutination gave identical grouping results for 98.0% of the 345 streptococci identified by Streptex, and the kappa coefficient of agreement between the methods for all 352 extracts tested was 0.973. Cross reactions with Listeria spp seen with Streptex were not found by reverse passive haemagglutination. In the reverse passive haemagglutination method 11 streptococci could be grouped on each 96-well plate and most reactions were stable for at least 30 minutes. Reverse passive haemagglutination is more rapid to perform than latex slide agglutination when many organisms are to be grouped, and the patterns of haemagglutination are easily recognised. If the method was taken into routine use in a diagnostic laboratory, the persistence of reverse passive haemagglutination reactions would enable grouping results to be checked for quality control purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen cases of AIDS related, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were examined for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes using in situ hybridisation with a 35S-labelled probe. The results were compared with those obtained independently by Southern blot analysis with a 32P-labelled probe of frozen tissue from the same tumours. Technically satisfactory results were obtained with both methods in 15 lymphomas. EBV DNA was detected in seven of 15 (47%) cases by in situ hybridisation and in eight of 15 (53%) cases by Southern blotting (including all the cases positive by in situ hybridisation). The results of EBV DNA detection by the two techniques were identical in 14 of 15 (93%) cases. In situ hybridisation gave no false positive results. This study shows that the sensitivity and specificity of in situ hybridisation for the detection of EBV genomes in AIDS related lymphomas approaches that of Southern blotting, even when using routinely processed archival, paraffin wax embedded material.\r"

  ".U": "91365913\r", 
  ".W": "Following two outbreaks of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in a maternity unit, 500 pregnant women attending an antenatal clinic were screened for carriage of epidermolytic toxin producing Staphylococcus aureus. Nasal, axillary, and perineal swabs were collected from women whose gestational ages ranged from 12-40 weeks. Isolates of S aureus were purified, phage typed, and tested for methicillin sensitivity and production of epidermolytic toxin. The results showed that 164 (33%) women carried S aureus; of these, 100 (61%) were from the nose and three (2%) from axillae, but 41 (25%) strains were isolated from the perineum alone. Screening for nasal carriage alone will therefore miss 25% of carriers. More than one strain of S aureus was identified in seven of 20 women with multiple site carriage. Three (2%) methicillin resistant strains were isolated during the survey, and five (3%) isolates produced epidermolytic toxin. Phage typing identified 63 (34%) strains as non-typable, but 50% of isolates typed either groups I, II or III, and a further 10% represented varying combinations of these and other phage groups. These results provide baseline information on S aureus in the community, and identification of methicillin resistant and toxin producing strains shows a reservoir of outbreak potential which could become relevant on hospital admission of such a carrier.\r"

They were designed in the 1930s, and except for the introduction of different kinds of stops and guards there has been no change in their basic structure and design. These instruments are small, do not fit properly in the operator's hand, and the lack of a T-bar handle often makes them difficult to manoeuvre; their introduction into the sternum by twisting or rotary movement of the hand can be cumbersome. To overcome all of these disadvantages an instrument was designed which is larger, provides better grip, and offers improved maneuverability. The stilette of this aspiration needle has a domed handle which rests snugly in the operator's hand and affords operator comfort, while the specially shaped large T-bar handle at the proximal end of the needle provides adequate and firm grip and also ensures precise control during the sternal puncture procedure.\r"

He had required a renal transplant 18 months before presenting with acute myeloid leukaemia (FAB subtype M4). He had received cyclosporin 3.5-4.0 mg/kg daily to maintain a plasma cyclosporin concentration of 75-150 ng/ml. Cyclosporin was continued during induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-thioguanine (DAT). He had fever and oropharyngeal candidiasis that was unresponsive to anti-bacterial drugs but responsive to systemic amphotericin. Bone marrow examination 14 days after chemotherapy showed complete haematological remission. Subsequently he tolerated consolidation treatment with DAT with no serious complications. Unfortunately he developed fatal septicaemia following a second consolidation with mitozantrone and cytarabine. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity by cyclosporin may not significantly increase the toxicity of aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens, and as benefit may be achieved by this approach further clinical evaluation is justified.\r"

Recurrence rates were calculated by three methods for each of the treatment modalities: 1) by the raw recurrence rate method; 2) by the \"strict\" 5-year recurrence rate method; and 3) by modification of the life-table method. Our analyses show that the last method best approximates the true recurrence rate. Primary (previously untreated) BCCs had a 5-year recurrence rate of 10.6% (standard error 0.6%), and previously treated BCCs had a rate of 15.4% (standard error 1.3%) (P = .0002). The greatest risk for recurrence of treated primary BCCs occurred 1 to 4 years after therapy. It is concluded that recurrence rates of primary BCCs should be reported separately from those of previously treated BCCs and that the modified life-table method is best suited to calculate 5-year recurrence rates.\r"

This report deals with 2314 previously untreated (primary) BCCs removed by curettage-electrodesiccation. Multivariate analysis showed that increasing lesion diameter (P less than .001), high-risk anatomic sites (nose, paranasal, nasal-labial groove, ear, chin, mandibular, peri-oral, and peri-ocular areas) (P less than .001), middle-risk anatomical sites (scalp, forehead, pre- and post-auricular, and malar areas) (P less than .001), and time-span treated (1955 to 1963) (P = .012) were independent risk factors for high recurrence rates. The patient's age, sex, and lesion duration before treatment did not affect the recurrence rates. In order to best illustrate our current experience with BCCs, the last time-span (1973 to 1982) was examined in detail. For the low-risk sites (neck, trunk, and four extremities), BCCs of all diameters responded well to curettage-electrodesiccation with an overall 5-year recurrence rate of 3.3% (SE = 1.5%) determined by the modified life-table method. In the middle-risk sites BCCs less than 10 mm in diameter had a recurrence rate of 5.3% (SE = 2.7%). Finally, in the high-risk sites, lesions less than 6 mm in diameter had a recurrence rate of 4.5% (SE = 2.6%). Thus, BCCs less than 6 mm in diameter, regardless of anatomic site, as well as selected larger BCCs depending on their anatomic site, are effectively treated by currettage-electrodesiccation.\r"

In addition, a significantly lower adenylate cyclase activity was observed in crude membrane fractions of macrophages from the group with asthma in the presence of salbutamol and prostaglandin E2. The refractoriness observed in patients with asthma is thus not accounted for by a specific beta-adrenergic desensitization at the adenylate cyclase receptor level but should rather be explained by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent postreceptor mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "On activation of human basophilic granulocytes with anti-IgE or with the chemotactic peptide, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, the expression of the CD63 antigen on the cell surface, detected by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 435, increased up to 100-fold. The kinetics of CD63 up regulation and histamine release were identical, and a strong correlation was found between percentage of MAb 435-binding basophils and extent of histamine release. Immunoelectronmicroscopy demonstrated that the epitope for MAb 435 in resting basophils is located on the basophilic granule membrane. After basophil activation, MAb 435 bound to the exterior of the plasma membrane. Experiments with various doses of anti-IgE demonstrated that the binding of MAb 435 to basophilic granulocytes follows an all-or-nothing-like response per cell. Basophils either do not bind the MAb at all, or they bind a maximal amount of the MAb. We also measured the up regulation of the CD11/CD18 leukocyte adhesion complex. Here, too, we noted an increase in cell-surface exposure of all subunits after activation. This increase was not as strong as increase found with MAb 435. Thus, MAb 435 is an interesting new tool for investigating the activation of human basophils, in addition to the measurement of mediator release. This MAb may be useful for the detection of basophil activation in vivo.\r"

After 2 to 10 years of VIT, all patients had deliberate sting challenges (DSCs) from live insects. If DSCs were tolerated, patients voluntarily stopped VIT and returned annually for repeat venom skin tests (VSTs) and DSCs. In most patients, it was possible to monitor VST and venom-specific antibody (Ab) levels before and after VIT was stopped. One-year after VIT, VST and venom-specific IgE and IgG Ab level results were variable; 49 patients tolerated DSC, whereas two patients exhibited generalized reactions. These two patients had pre-VIT histories of grade IV field-sting reactions and had received VIT for 2 years and 4 years, respectively. The short-term (1 year) risk of recurrence of clinical allergy to stings after VIT was higher in patients who had experienced grade IV field-sting reactions before VIT versus patients experiencing grade I to III reactions before VIT (2/15, 13% versus 0/36, 0%) and higher in patients who had received VIT for less than 5 years versus patients who received VIT for 5 or more years (2/20, 10% versus 0/31, 0%). We suggest that VIT should be continued for 5 years in patients with pre-VIT field-sting reactions of grade IV severity. VST and venom-specific Ab results do not reliably predict the outcome of DSC or the subsequent clinical course in individual patients stopping VIT.\r"

Some of these anti-Id Abs are capable of binding to the combining site or paratope of Abs that bind Ag. These Ab2 can competitively inhibit the binding of Ab1 to Ag may trigger an Ab1 response similar to the response induced by Ag. To determine if specific Ab2 that inhibit the binding of IgE Abs to ryegrass (RG)-pollen allergens are present in the sera of RG-allergic (RGA) individuals before the initiation of allergen-specific hyposensitization with RG-pollen extract, we studied sera from five RGA and four nonallergic (NA) subjects in an IgE anti-RG RAST-inhibition assay. Ab2-enriched serum fractions were prepared from these study subjects by exhaustive mixed grass-pollen affinity chromatography to remove IgE and IgG anti-RG Ab1 from whole serum aliquots containing Ab1. Unabsorbed, twice-concentrated sera were diluted to one-time concentrated sera with equal volumes of either Ab2-enriched sera without Ab1 or borate-buffered saline absorbed by mixed grass-pollen affinity chromatography. IgE anti-RG Ab1 was determined by a standard RG RAST assay. We have detected Ab2 in the sera of the RGA patients, which inhibit the binding of autologous and allogeneic IgE anti-RG to RG Ags in solid phase. Parallel RG RAST assays with sera from NA subjects demonstrated no significant inhibition. Ab2-enriched sera from some grass-allergic and some NA subjects inhibited IgE anti-RG binding found in some RGA patients' sera. We conclude that anti-Id Abs, Ab2, specific for IgE anti-RG, Ab1, are present in some RGA patients and NA individuals.\r"

It is secreted into saliva and other mucosal fluids and is involved in mucosal immunity. The absence of either SC or secretory IgA may be associated with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. We present a retrospective study of 1262 samples from 877 patients who were screened for salivary IgA, SC, and serum immunoglobulin levels. Forty-six patients (5.2%) of those tested were found to have absent salivary SC. Although only 19 of these patients (41.3%) could be retested, all were found to have SC on repeated testing. Of the patients whose initial samples of saliva exhibited no SC, 15% (6/46) had low or absent serum IGA (less than 10 mg/dl) in contrast to 8.6% (66/769) of patients whose saliva contained detectable SC, but this was not statistically significant (chi 2 = 1.93; p greater than 0.1). There was also no correlation between serum immunoglobulin levels and the absence of SC. Because of the rarity of salivary SC deficiency, routine screening is not valuable.\r"

High levels of EPO could be released after addition of the specific allergen (and not unrelated ones) or anti-IgE MAb. Moreover, EPO release with the two stimuli was significantly correlated both in allergic and in nonallergic patients. In the same supernatants, another granule protein, ECP, could not be detected, suggesting a lack of correlation between EPO and ECP release after IgE-dependent stimulation. However, when EOSs with surface-IgA antibodies were incubated with anti-IgA MAb, both EPO and ECP were released. In contrast, incubation of EOSs with anti-IgG MAb induced mainly the release of ECP and not EPO. These results indicate that pharmacologically active mediators can be released by EOSs from allergic and nonallergic patients on immunoglobulin-dependent activation. The results also confirm the hypothesis of a selective release of the various granule proteins and raise the question of transduction signals delivered by the three Fc receptors (Fc epsilon R, FC alpha R, and FC gamma R) present on human EOSs.\r"

To evaluate the potential role of endothelin in the pathogenesis of asthma, we examined in this study the release of endothelin in the airways of six patients with asthma, both at the time when they were symptomatic and had reversible airflow obstruction and during the remission phase of the disease induced by treatment. Five normal volunteers and five patients with chronic bronchitis and airflow obstruction unaffected by bronchodilators were tested as control subjects. The release of endothelin in airway mucosa was assessed by RIA with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid recovered during bronchoscopy. Patients with asthma had increased amounts of immunoreactive endothelin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than normal control subjects or subjects with chronic bronchitis (p less than 0.05) in absence of any significant alteration in the levels of circulating peptide. Treatment of patients with asthma with oral corticosteroids and inhaled beta-agonists for 15 days resulted in improvement of airflow obstruction and in more than threefold reduction in the contents of endothelin in lavage fluid. Our findings indicate that the potent bronchoconstrictive substance, endothelin, may contribute to the pathogenesis of airflow obstruction in asthma.\r"

The FEV1 increased significantly after high dosage (median, 96.5% versus 105.5%; p = 0.0339). After lower dosage, FEV1 was still higher than at the baseline (106% versus 96.5%; p = 0.0339). Clinically, no additional beta2-agonist was needed after 2 weeks of treatment. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly by 22% after high dosage (medians, 1.18 versus 1.44 mmol/L). A significant decline to 1.31 mmol/L was observed when the dose was reduced (overall, p = 0.0319). The treatment had no significant effect on serum total cholesterol, on serum triglycerides, on the ratio of high-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol, on the body mass index, or on glucose tolerance. The high dosage increased significantly the ratio of serum insulin to blood glucose, calculated from the areas under the incremental 2-hour curves in the glucose tolerance test (medians, 17.3 versus 23.2 mU/mmol). After lower dosage, the ratio declined significantly to 13.5 mU/mmol (overall, p = 0.0164). No significant changes were observed in plasma cortisol in the 2-hour adrenocorticotropic hormone test. The antiasthmatic effect of budesonide inhalations in a dose of 800 micrograms/m2/day for 1 month was accompanied by detectable changes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These metabolic changes were reversible, and the antiasthmatic effect could be maintained by a dose of 400 micrograms/m2 for 4 months without significant systemic effects. This dose is safe and efficient in the maintenance treatment of childhood asthma.\r"

Although four patients developed frank ABPA, there was considerable variability in immune parameters in non-ABPA. Twenty-four patients became skin test positive to Af with none losing skin reactivity. Twenty-five patients developed serum precipitins to Af, whereas 12 patients lost their precipitins. Of 15 patients with an elevated total serum IgE of greater than or equal to 2 SD, five demonstrated a marked decline of at least 40%. Three of 16 patients with IgE-Af became negative, whereas eight of 27 patients lost their IgG-Af. None of these patients had received corticosteroid therapy that could have accounted for the findings. Thus, patients with CF frequently lose evidence of Af sensitivity spontaneously without corticosteroid intervention. The diagnosis of ABPA in CF should not be based solely on serology and skin test results, since at any point in time, patients with CF may demonstrate variable responses to Af.\r"

Administration of 8-MP at a dose of 10 mg followed by UVA irradiation (1 joule/cm2) suppressed the skin flare-and-wheal response to codeine and decreased the number of visible degranulated mast cells in biopsy specimens examined histologically. UVA irradiation alone enhanced the skin wheal-and-flare response to either codeine or histamine. The inhibitory effect of 8-MP plus UVA irradiation on both wheal-and-flare responses to codeine tended to decrease, and an increasing enhancement of the skin response to histamine could be observed as the dose of 8-MP was increased from 10 to 30 mg. We postulate that (1) a single 8-MP plus UVA irradiation treatment at appropriate doses could be a potential approach to modulate the mediator-releasing properties of mast cells resident in the skin and (2) the underlying mechanisms of this inhibition is complex, probably reflecting a balance between the inhibitory effect of 8-MP plus UVA irradiation on mast cell-mediator release, enhancement of the vascular response to histamine, and direct photoactivation of resident mast cells.\r"

Eighteen (90%) of the women had historical and/or laboratory evidence of atopy. Exposures included ingestion or dispensing of psyllium-containing products. Only three women denied prior exposure to psyllium. Symptoms developed shortly after small amounts of the cereal were ingested and most commonly included moderate to severe wheezing, throat and chest tightness, and urticaria. All the women required medical therapy, 11 (55%) in an emergency room. Specific IgE and IgG antibodies to various psyllium protein fractions were documented in all the subjects. It was concluded that individuals sensitized by occupational exposure to psyllium dust are at high risk for allergic reactions to ingested psyllium-containing products.\r"

In another group of ad libitum fed and food-restricted rats, the influence of age on the response of plasma corticosterone levels to restraint stress was measured as was the time course of the return of plasma corticosterone to basal levels following the stress. The findings do not support the hypothesis that food restriction retards the aging processes by preventing the development of hyperadrenocorticism with advancing age.

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to determine more accurately the relationship between IGF-1 and life span, and to determine whether moderate dietary caloric restriction alters the age-related changes in IGF-1. Studies included an assessment of plasma IGF-1, hepatic IGF-1 mRNA, and plasma IGF-1 binding proteins (IGF-1-BP). Rats (6, 12, 22, and 28 months of age) were fed ad libitum or maintained on a diet 60% of ad libitum. In ad libitum fed animals, plasma IGF-1 decreased by 20% between 6 and 28 months of age. Similar age-related declines were observed in dietary restricted animals but levels were generally 14-25% lower at each age group. IGF-1 mRNA levels demonstrated similar decreases with age in ad libitum fed animals, but in dietary restricted animals, levels plateaued at 22 and 28 months. IGF-1 binding protein analysis revealed 3 bands at approximate molecular weights of 40k, 30k, and 24k. All bands demonstrated a decrease in relative IGF-1-BP concentration with age, as well as a decrease in the 40k and 30k binding proteins after dietary restriction. These results indicate that (a) aging in ad libitum fed animals is associated with decreases in plasma IGF-1, IGF-1-BP, and IGF-1 mRNA levels; and (b) long-term dietary restriction decreases plasma IGF-1 and IGF-1-BP levels in each age group although the age-associated decreases in IGF-1 mRNA levels are prevented by dietary restriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Young (5-month) and old (21-month) Fischer 344 male rats were either exposed to intermittent sessions of an escapable footshock stress for 3 months, or to no chronic stress. Afterwards, blood samples were obtained from each rat before, during, and after the first and fourth exposure to a novel motion stimulus. Between the first and the fourth exposure to the motion stimulus a pronounced attenuation of glucose and insulin responses was seen in both groups of young rats, and in old chronically stressed rats, but not in old control animals. Thus, it appears that the adverse effects of aging on plasticity of glucoregulatory response processes were significantly diminished by exposure of the animals to periodic challenges from their external environment.\r"

Older neuroleptic-treated patients exhibited significantly greater instability of isometric force compared with older controls, younger patients, or younger controls.

These findings are discussed as they pertain to potential mechanisms underlying neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of the mechanisms of osteoporosis have not yet determined whether these conditions result from increased osteoclast activity or decreased osteoblast activity, or perhaps both. Osteoporosis is related to aging and to postmenopausal status. The function and the mitotic capacity of cultured human osteoblast-like cells were investigated in this study. The age at which these cells lose the ability to divide showed a strong negative correlation with donor age (r = .815, p less than .01). There was also significant correlation of maximum cell saturation density with donor age (r = .698, p less than .01). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization ability, typical functions of osteoblasts, continue undiminished up to the point at which mitotic capacity ceases. When cells were treated with 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 in the presence of 2 mM alpha-glycerophosphate, ALP activity and mineralization ability showed an increase, rather than a decrease, with advancing donor age. However, these functions showed no correlation with in vitro cell aging. We propose that human osteoblast-like cells from elderly subjects do not lose their functions of mineralization and ALP formation, and that loss of these functions with cell aging does not correlate with advancing age.\r"

The GH response to GHRH was significantly lower in the older than in the younger group (mean peaks were 4.5 and 7.5 times higher than baseline, respectively). Theophylline did not change basal GH levels in any subjects and GHRH-induced GH rise in the younger group, whereas it restored normal GH responses to GHRH in the older subjects (mean peak responses were eight times higher than baseline in both groups). These data show that in elderly subjects the mechanism underlying the GHRH-induced GH secretion may be fully activated by GHRH during treatment with low amounts of theophylline.\r"

Postural change in blood pressure was defined as a drop of 20 mm Hg or more on change from supine to seated position. In subjects on no antihypertensive medications (n = 7,316), the prevalence of postural change in blood pressure increased with older age and with higher blood pressure levels, regardless of age. However, systolic blood pressure levels also increased with age. In logistic regression models, level of supine systolic blood pressure was strongly related to postural change in blood pressure (Relative odds (RO) = 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.49, 1.70 for a 10 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure) whereas age was not related to postural change in blood pressure (RO for age = 1.07, Cl = .89, 1.19 for a 10-year increase in age). Results were similar for those medicated for hypertension. All results were unchanged by addition of health status indicators, including reports of hospitalization and number of medical conditions, to the model. These data suggest that the age-related increase in the prevalence of postural hypotension previously reported may be partially explained by age-associated increases in systolic blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a prospective study of the consequences of falls in 325 elderly community-dwelling persons, all of whom had fallen in the previous year. We contacted subjects every week for one year to ascertain falls and to determine the circumstances and consequences of falls. Only 6% of 539 falls resulted in a major injury (fracture, dislocation, or laceration requiring suture), but over half (55%) resulted in minor soft tissue injury. One in ten falls left the faller unable to get up for at least 5 minutes, and one in four falls caused subjects to limit their activities. The risk of injury per fall was about the same regardless of the number of falls a person had during follow-up. The risk of major injury was increased (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio: 5.9, 95% confidence interval: 2.3-14.9) in falls associated with loss of consciousness compared to nonsyncopal falls. In multivariate analyses of nonsyncopal falls, the risk of major injury per fall was higher in persons having a previous fall with fracture (6.7; 2.1-21.5), a slower Trail Making B time (1.9; 1.1-3.2), and in Whites (18.4; 7.5-44.6). The risk that a nonsyncopal fall would result in minor injury (versus no injury) was increased in persons with a slower hand reaction time (1.8; 1.0-3.2) decreased grip strength (1.5; 1.0-2.3), in Whites (2.0; 1.0-3.7), in falls while using stairs and steps (2.2; 1.0-5.0), and turning around or reaching (3.5; 1.7-7.3). Our findings suggest that neuromuscular and cognitive impairment, as well as the circumstances of falls, affect the risk of injury when a fall occurs.\r"

In almost all laboratory measures the older group slept poorly compared with the young, acquiring about one hour less total recorded sleep. The older group showed earlier habitual time of waking than the young, and showed higher (more \"morning-type\") scores on test instruments (HOM, CTQ-M) designed to assess morning-evening orientation. They also showed a lack of flexibility in sleep patterns (higher CTQ-Rs score) and less intersubject and intrasubject variability in habitual sleep timing compared to the young. Older subjects' morningness test scores were significantly associated with objectively measured sleep durations, with a tendency toward \"morning-type\" circadian orientation being associated with longer sleep.\r"

A study was designed using a murine model to assess the influence of age on the febrile response to the endogenous pyrogen, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Twenty (10 young: 4-6 months; 10 old: 24-28 months) BALB/c mice were injected with 50 ng of TNF alpha into the intraperitoneal space; the experiments were repeated one week later with 100 ng TNF alpha. Control animals received intraperitoneal injections of pyrogen-free phosphate buffered saline. Temperatures were measured rectally at baseline and at 10-minute intervals for 90 minutes post-injection using a thermistor probe and temperature gauge. In the majority of the time intervals following injection, the mean temperature changes of young mice were significantly higher than old mice for both 50 ng and 100 ng doses of TNF alpha. Similarly, peak temperature changes from baseline were consistently higher in young animals following injection of TNF alpha. Moreover, the peak temperature changes in young mice after 50 ng TNF alpha injection were significantly higher than those in old mice following a 100 ng injection of TNF alpha. These findings confirm that (a) TNF alpha has a role in the pathogenesis of fever; (b) aging alters significantly the febrile response; and (c) a mechanism of this age-related blunted febrile response may involve TNF alpha.\r"

Subjects judged whether a subsequent probe letter was or was not transposed from its original presentation position. One block of primary memory trials (i.e., no distractor task) and one block of secondary memory trials (i.e., a 10-second distractor task) were used. Experiment 2 used basically the same task, except both blocks of trials were primary memory tasks, and acoustic similarity was manipulated. A processing variability model predicted that both experiments should show distance effects (i.e., transposing letters a distance of one box should result in more errors and/or longer reaction times than a transposition of two, or three boxes) for both right and left transposition directions. However, a generalized slowing model predicted that distance effects should only occur for left transpositions (because of left-to-right scanning order). The present data supported the processing variability model but not the generalized slowing model.\r"

Presumably, the experimental manipulations on which Cerella based his caution induced a broad focus of attention so that changes in perceptual processing would not be confounded with changes in attention. Experiment 1 tested this by comparing a condition similar to Cerella's with another in which attention was narrowly focused at fixation. The results replicated Cerella's findings. In addition, there were greater age differences when attention had been narrowly focused, showing that attentional effects can be separated from the effects reported by Cerella. Experiment 2 showed that age differences in extrafoveal perception could be removed by increasing the duration of the target from 200 to 2000 ms, suggesting that the perceptual deficits in older adults are due to differentially lengthened processing of stimuli outside the fovea.\r"

If they recognized the tune, they were asked for the name of the program and for as much information about the program as possible. From the responses to a subsequent questionnaire, it was possible to divide the data according to whether or not the subjects watched the programs. There was no effect of age on the recognition and naming of programs subjects never watched. For programs they watched (a true test of memory), older subjects recognized fewer tunes as familiar and were less able than younger subjects to name the programs with familiar tunes. Neither the amount of exposure nor the delay since exposure had a significant influence on the recognition and naming impairments with age. Older subjects reported less information about programs they watched than younger subjects. In multiple regression analyses, age was a better predictor of performance than measures of current cognitive ability. The results are compared with the effects of age on the recognition and naming of famous faces (Maylor, 1990a). It is argued that the studies together support the view that the information processing rate decreases with age; therefore the elderly are poor at speeded tasks, the most dramatic effects appearing for later components of sequential processes.\r"

To evaluate susceptibility to background interference, each target was accompanied by one or more unrelated background words. On a recognition test, susceptibility to background interference appeared to be greater in diabetic individuals. The allocation of processing resources to target and background stimuli was more uniform in diabetic than in nondiabetic individuals. While choice improved recognition of target and background words for both groups, its effectiveness was attenuated in NIDDM. Choice facilitates the differentiation of target from background stimuli--a process that may reduce interference from background stimuli.\r"

Regression analyses show that poor ego and chronic medical problems were the common predictors of depression among both the males and females. Gender differences were found with regard to life events in that females tended to become more depressed as the number of events increased and as level of contact with relatives and friends decreased. Further, females with lower levels of social attachment, guidance, and reliability were more depressed. None of these social support dimensions related to depression among the males. These relationships tended to be stronger for those living alone than for those living with others.\r"

The Self-Anchoring Scale was used to rate life in the present, the past (five years before), and the future (five years ahead). Subjects were the respondents of five national surveys in Israel. The findings showed an age-related configuration where progressive age was associated with declining ratings for the future, a milder decline for the present, and a relative increase for the past. In addition to rating levels, a structural modeling approach was used to explore the relative salience of these time referents, considered as indicators of the construct of life satisfaction. LISREL estimates of the indicator loadings in two related models showed the present as most salient and the past as least salient in most age groups. The salience of the past increased in later life, when that of the future did as well. The time-related construct of life satisfaction (which fit the data in all age groups) highlights the yet undetermined role of the future in the subjective well-being of the elderly.\r"

The latent constructs were measured by items composing the PGC Scale (Lawton, 1975). Maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis techniques were used to test the fit of the model. Subjective well-being was investigated using a panel of older rural adults surviving a ten-year, two-wave investigation. Results of the study provided support for the hierarchical factor structure of well-being in cross-sectional analyses. This factor structure was varied across time, however.\r"

Strong support was found for both. Racial differences were observed in household structure, association with grandchildren, grand-filial expectations, help given to grandchildren, and in affection for grandchildren. Similarities, however, were seen in the ranked importance of the role, in the amount of help received from grandchildren, and in grandfather-grandchild consensus. The findings support a cultural rather than a structural/economic base for the grandfather role, thus validating the cultural variant perspective.\r"

Net of other caregiver and care-receiver characteristics, daughters were 3.22 times more likely than sons to provide ADL assistance and 2.56 times more likely to provide IADL assistance. Although these results are not substantively different from previous research, the methodological approach taken provides a better empirical base for estimating the effect of gender on the probability of being involved in parent care.\r"

The respondents report giving more support than they receive until age 85+. Controls for income and activities of daily living extend the age at which role reversal occurs, and further controls for the number of people in the social network eliminate it. Examining different types of support and different sources of support shows that similar results apply to both affective and instrumental support, but that this pattern applies more to exchanges with family members, as all forms of role reversal are less likely in exchanges with nonfamily.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of an Ag ligand with its B cell surface Ig (sIg) receptor can occur via an FcR-dependent or -independent pathway. We previously found that transfected TNP-specific B cells undergo both Ca2+ signaling and desensitization upon interaction with the thymus-dependent Ag TNP-OVA. Similarly, we showed that these B cells can also be desensitized by cross-linking sIg to the Fc gamma R via the formation of an Ag-antibody bridge. Thus, Ag-specific B cells can be desensitized by two different Ag-dependent events, one mediated by Ag-sIg interaction and the other by sIg-Fc gamma R cross-linking. Inasmuch as Ag-sIg and sIg-Fc gamma R interactions lead to positive and negative signaling, it was of interest to determine whether B cell desensitization mediated by these interactions occurs by one of the well known signaling pathways in B cells. We found that Ag-induced changes in [Ca2+]i could be readily dissociated from Ag-induced desensitization, indicating that a Ca(2+)-independent pathway is likely responsible for this pathway of desensitization. To determine if PKC plays a role in B cell desensitization mediated by either Ag or sIg-Fc gamma R interaction, PKC was downregulated by long term exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or inhibited by exposure of cells to staurosporine. The PKC down-regulated and inhibited cells underwent similar Ag- and Fc gamma R-dependent desensitization compared to cells containing active PKC. Taken together, these data indicate that Ag-induced desensitization of B cell signaling likely involves an event(s) that occurs either upstream or independent of Ag-induced elevations in [Ca2+]i and PKC activation.\r"

To explore further the immunologic activities of bacterial DNA, its ability to stimulate in vitro proliferation of murine lymphocytes was tested. The stimulation of lymphocytes with highly purified ssDNA from Escherichia coli resulted in a dose-dependent response that was maximal at 48 h. Several lines of evidence indicate that DNA, rather than endotoxin contamination, induced this response: 1) LPS at doses equivalent to those detected in the DNA preparation caused significantly less proliferation than the DNA; 2) the response to DNA was insensitive to polymyxin B; 3) pretreatment of DNA with DNase completely abrogated the response; and 4) DNA induced the proliferation of cells from endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice. Furthermore, although DNA from three different bacterial species induced proliferation, mammalian DNA from three species were nonmitogenic. Depletion of T cells from lymphocytes did not reduce proliferation, suggesting that bacterial DNA directly triggered B cell proliferation. These studies provide further evidence that DNA are not uniform in their immunologic activities likely because of their content of nonconserved structural determinants.\r"

Using a nucleoprotein peptide (NPP) with a sequence derived from influenza virus nucleoprotein with high affinity for Kd class I MHC molecules, it is shown that target cells rapidly become lysable by Kd-NPP self-restricted cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, and retain sufficient Kd-NPP complexes for at least 72 h. Kd-specific alloreactive Tc cells at the clonal and polyclonal level do not show decreased lysis of Kd-bearing targets in the continuous long term (48 h) presence of NPP. Kd-stimulator cells modified with NPP are able to induce potent Kd-NPP-specific self-restricted Tc cells, however Kd-NPP stimulator cells do not generate Kd-NPP specific alloreactive Tc cells from CBA and B10.A (5R) mouse strains as tested by limiting dilution split clone experiments. Human cells infected with the vaccinia virus recombinant coding for the murine Kd class I MHC Ag can be lysed by murine Kd-specific alloreactive Tc cells. In addition the rate of reemergence of alloreactive and self-restricted Tc cell epitopes on virally infected target cells that had their cell-surface class I MHC Ag removed is identical. These results are consistent with model 3 namely that the majority of Tc precursor and effector cells recognize class I MHC Ag without peptide specificity.\r"

A combination of phenotypic analysis of cell surface Ag and molecular analysis of the gamma- and delta-genes was used to demonstrate that vaginal gamma delta-T cells have several features that distinguish them from gamma delta-T cells present in other tissues. Three color flow cytofluorometric analysis demonstrated that freshly isolated vaginal gamma delta-T cells are CD4-CD8- and their expression of Thy-1 is strain dependent. Furthermore, specific differences in CD5, CD28, and p55IL-2 receptor expression were found between alpha beta- and gamma delta-T cells isolated from vaginal tissue. The vaginal gamma delta-T cells are predominantly CD45+, pgp-1+, HSA-, Ly-6C-, and MEL-14-. Both alpha beta- and gamma delta-T cells were absent in vaginal tissue from nude mice, although Thy-1-positive cells are present. It was also demonstrated that V gamma 4 and V delta 1 are the only gamma- and delta-genes that are expressed by vaginal cells. Sequence analysis of their junctions revealed that they express the V gamma 4 and V delta 1 sequences also found in fetal thymocytes. Furthermore, the V delta 1 sequence is identical in the vaginal cells and the gamma delta-T cells from the epidermal epithelium. We conclude that the vagina, like the skin, is a site where gamma delta-T cells with an invariant TCR exist.\r"

  ".W": "The thymus is the major site of T cell development and repertoire selection. During these processes, T cells segregate into two subsets that express either CD4 or CD8 accessory molecules, the phenotype of peripheral T cells. Analysis of CD4+8- thymocytes revealed that the majority of these cells express the heat-stable Ag (HSA) but not the nonclassical class I Ag, Qa-2. This HSA+, Qa-2- phenotype is similar to that of the less mature, CD4+8+ thymocytes. The remaining CD4+8- thymocytes possess the HSA-, Qa-2+ phenotype of peripheral T cells. To determine whether the Qa-2-, CD4+8- thymic subset is fully mature, we have analyzed the functional status of these CD4+8- subpopulations. The results indicate that only those thymocytes which express Qa-2 are fully responsive to anti-TCR stimulation in a manner analogous to peripheral T cells. The Qa-2- subset is nonresponsive to stimulation by anti-TCR antibodies that have been immobilized to plastic, even in the presence of lymphokines or syngeneic APC. This subset is, however, capable of proliferating to allogeneic cells or to anti-TCR on the surface of syngeneic APC, although not to the levels achieved by Qa-2+ thymocytes. Thus, the Qa-2- subset appears to require additional interactions which are not necessary for peripheral T cells or Qa-2+ thymocytes. Relevant to this issue, the Qa-2+ thymocyte subset does not appear until relatively late in development, and does not reach adult frequencies until several weeks after birth. These results would suggest that there is a progression from HSA+, Qa-2- to HSA-, Qa-2+ which parallels the maturation of functional responsiveness. These findings are important to understanding T cell selection since thymocytes with such a decreased responsiveness may have a differential capacity for tolerance induction. The results presented suggest that the bulk of CD4+8- thymocytes are not fully mature and that Qa-2 may serve as a marker for T cells with a more complete functional competence.\r"

The B cell hybridoma could similarly process and present OVA to some T-T hybrids but was very inefficient in stimulating two of the T cell hybridomas. The presentation of native OVA to these two T-T hybrids was significantly increased by leupeptin. Pulsing experiments demonstrated that leupeptin acted on the APC at a step before the processed Ag was displayed on the cell surface in association with MHC molecules. Leupeptin has no effect on the presentation of OVA peptides by LS.102.9 to the T-T hybrids. Leupeptin inhibits the generation of the epitopes of OVA that LS.102.9 produces under basal conditions. We also surveyed the effect of other protease inhibitors and observed similar augmenting and inhibitory effects on the presentation of selected OVA epitopes. The augmentation of processing by a protease inhibitor indicates that in the lysosomal/endosomal compartment proteases have capacity to both generate and destroy immunogenic peptides. Our data suggest that protease inhibitors could potentially be used as immunomodulators and are discussed in terms of physiology of the lysosomal/endosomal compartment.\r"

In vivo administration of TGF-beta 1 into SJL mice was successful in reducing the incidence of clinical disease and the histologic severity of inflammation and demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. Immunohistochemical studies performed on control animals showed that TGF-beta-1, -2, and -3 were present in inflammatory perivascular lesions in the brain.

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that Ag-specific tolerance induced by the i.v. administration of splenocytes coupled with neuroantigens, such as mouse spinal cord homogenate, myelin basic protein (MBP), and proteolipid protein, and their encephalitogenic peptides, results in dramatic inhibition of clinical and histologic signs of both actively induced and adoptively transferred relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE). We report here that the administration of splenocytes coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate (i.e., a mixture of neuroantigens), after the first paralytic episode of adoptive R-EAE triggered by MBP-specific T cells but before the appearance of the first relapse, effectively reduced the onset and severity of all subsequent relapses, as determined by both clinical and pathologic criteria. In contrast, the i.v. administration of splenocytes coupled with MBP (i.e., the specificity of the initiating T cell response), under similar conditions, effectively inhibited the initial clinical relapse, but subsequent relapses occurred with the same incidence rate and severity as those in control animals. Collectively, these results demonstrate that neuroantigen-specific tolerance is effective at specifically down-regulating an ongoing autoimmune response. This may have potential clinical applicability for treatment of autoimmune diseases. The results also support the hypothesis that the neuroantigen specificity of later relapses of R-EAE may be due to effector T cells with specificities different from those that triggered the initial clinical episode. Thus, potential therapy for the advanced stages of R-EAE, and perhaps other autoimmune diseases, may have to be directed not simply against the effector cells initiating the disease but also against effector cells with differing specificities recruited as a result of tissue damage occurring in the initial acute disease.\r"

  ".W": "IL-1 and IL-6 activities were measured in the pleural exudate of rats during carrageenin-induced pleurisy to examine the relationship of the local production of cytokines to the inflammatory reaction. Time courses of appearance of the cytokines and inflammatory parameters in the exudate were compared. IL-1 activity and exudate volume started to increase at 1 h after the carrageenin injection, and then slightly later IL-6 activity and leukocyte number began to increase. IL-1 showed peak activity of approximately 700 U at 3 h and IL-6, of 6000 U at 5 h in the exudate, whereas exudate volume and number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes continued to increase thereafter. Furthermore, IL-6 level in the plasma of the carrageenin-injected rats showed a peak at 4 h (30 U/ml), and when rhIL-1 alpha (100,000 U) was intrapleurally injected, the more rapid increase in plasma IL-6 level was demonstrated at 1 h (30 U/ml). This latter rise was neutralized with simultaneous injection of anti-rhIL-1 alpha antibody. These facts indicate the possibility that IL-1 produced in the exudate or injected could rapidly propagate a signal to induce IL-6 production in the circulation. It took several hours to transmit an inflammatory signal that stimulated the liver to synthesize the acute-phase protein, T-kininogen. The time lag from the peak induction of IL-1 to the T-kininogen-increase in the pleurisy corresponded well to the interval for T-kininogen-increase by exogenous rhIL-1 alpha injection. These results strongly suggest that the initial inflammatory stimulus induces sequentially IL-1, IL-6, and T-kininogen production in this carrageenin inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "91366133\r", 
  ".W": "It has been reported that the Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) from patients with acute bacterial infections is markedly enhanced when compared with healthy controls. Inasmuch as several potent cytokines are known to be involved in inflammatory and infectious processes, we studied the effects of three such cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-2, and TNF-alpha) on normal PMN Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis. IL-1 beta and TNF alpha both caused a significant increase in the ingestion of EIgG by adherent PMN. In combination, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha had an additive effect, even when each was used at its optimal concentration. In contrast to the enhancing effects mediated by IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, IL-2 alone had no significant effect on PMN phagocytosis. Notably, however, IL-2 at a concentration of 10(4) U/ml partially inhibited TNF-alpha-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis by decreasing TNF binding to the PMN cell surface. This inhibitory effect of IL-2 on TNF was reversed by anti-IL-2 antibody and mAb directed against the low affinity IL-2R (anti-Tac), whereas mAb directed against the intermediate affinity receptor (mik-beta 1) had no such effect. These findings may have important physiologic implications, because patients receiving IL-2 therapy have been shown to have increased susceptibility to infection.\r"

  ".U": "91366136\r", 
  ".W": "The multifunctional cytokines, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and beta 2, have the capability of inducing human peripheral blood monocytes to express the type III receptor for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc gamma RIII/CD16). In this study we show that the T cell-derived cytokine, IL-4, antagonizes the ability of TGF-beta to induce the expression of CD16. Furthermore, this ability to down-regulate expression of CD16 is completely abrogated after treatment with polyclonal anti-IL-4, suggesting that IL-4 is solely responsible for the observed inhibition. The mechanism for negating the effect of TGF-beta is not due to decreased expression of surface receptors for TGF-beta, but appears to occur at the mRNA level. Nuclear run-off assays indicate that regulation occurs predominantly through a posttranscriptional mechanism(s), although a transcriptional process cannot be ruled out. Normally, CD16 appears on only a small population of circulating monocytes, however, expression is apparent on the majority of mature tissue and inflammatory macrophages likely due to the release of TGF-beta in these sites. Inasmuch as this receptor binds immune complexes and opsonized particles, it is associated with enhanced immunophagocytosis. Suppression of CD16 expression and its ability to suppress a number of other monocyte functions suggests that IL-4 may play an important role in the resolution of inflammatory and tissue repair responses.\r"

  ".W": "BALB/c mice were inoculated i.p. with a cross-reactive anti-Idiotypic mAb (designated FD5-1) in the absence of Ag or adjuvants. Injection with unmodified FD5-1 resulted in the induction of serum antibodies reactive with both FD5-1 (Ab3) and the hapten DNP (Ab1'). Endpoint titers of the Ab3 response showed an increase in serum IgM, which was dose-responsive to both the number of injections and the amount of FD5-1 antibody injected. The serum IgM Ab3 response was found to be thymus dependent and idiotypically specific for FD5-1. Athymic mice injected with FD5-1 were unable to produce a serum IgM Ab3 response, whereas their euthymic littermates produced strong Ab3 responses. Serum Ab3 responses and Ab1' were detectable only in the IgM isotype; no specific IgG responses were observed. Indeed, IgG recognized by FD5-1 appeared to be suppressed by FD5-1. Injection of mice with FD5-1 modulated serum IgM responses to DNP, (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP), 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyloxazol-5-one (OX), phosphorylcholine (PC), and alpha 1,3-dextran (DEX) in a thymus-dependent manner. FD5-1 injection induced IgM responses against DNP, (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP), 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyloxazol-5-one, and DEX but decreased IgM binding to PC. No detectable Ab1' responses to any of the aforementioned molecules were found when the same sera were probed for IgG. The specificity of serum Ab1' from FD5-1-injected mice was evaluated by antigenic inhibition. Binding of serum Ab1' to DNP-BSA was inhibitable by DNP-lysine, whereas equivalent concentrations of lysine alone had no inhibitory effect. The antigenic specificity of IgM from normal serum binding to PC-BSA was demonstrated by inhibition with free PC, and the binding of Ab1' from FD5-1-injected mice to DEX-coated plates was shown to be inhibitable by DEX. We have described in vivo network perturbation in adult BALB/c mice injected with anti-Id antibody in the absence of Ag or adjuvants. Our findings show that injection of the cross-reactive anti-Id FD5-1 can induce thymus-dependent Ag-specific responses. In two systems where FD5-1 functions as an anti-anti-anti-Id antibody (PC and DEX), thymus-dependent responses were also observed. FD5-1 injection suppressed antibodies binding to PC, whereas DEX-specific responses were induced.\r"

  ".W": "Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is a cell-surface phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that protects the cell from inadvertent complement attack by binding to and inactivating C3 and C5 convertases. We have measured DAF on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by immunoradiometric assay after its removal by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C or Nonidet P-40 detergent extraction and have previously demonstrated that DAF synthesis can be stimulated by phorbol ester activation of protein kinase C. We now report that although stimulation (4-48 h) of HUVEC with various cytokines, including TNF, IL-1, and IFN-gamma, did not alter DAF levels, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (5-50 micrograms/ml), a lectin specific for binding N-acetyl neuraminic acid and N-acetyl glucosamine residues, increased DAF levels fivefold when incubated with HUVEC for 12 to 24 h. The lectins Con A and PHA also stimulated DAF expression twofold, whereas a number of others including Ulex europaeus, Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin I, and Ricinus communis agglutinin I, which bind to endothelial cells, were inactive. The increase in DAF by WGA was inhibited by N-acetyl glucosamine (10-50 mM) but by neither N-acetyl neuraminic acid nor removal of surface N-acetyl neuraminic acid with neuraminidase. However, succinylated WGA, which has unaltered affinity for N-acetyl glucosamine but not longer binds N-acetyl neuraminic acid, was inactive. These data suggest that the binding of WGA to sugar residues alone is not sufficient to trigger DAF expression and that occupation of additional, specific sites are required. The increase in DAF levels on HUVEC was blocked by inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. We conclude that continuous occupation by WGA of specific binding sites on HUVEC triggers events leading to DAF synthesis. This unique, long term stimulation of endothelial cells by lectins may be relevant to cell:cell interactions at the endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "Chimeric Fc gamma R have been generated between the mouse high affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI) and the low affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RII) by exchanging the first two domains of the three-domain extracellular structure of Fc gamma RI with the homologous two-domain extracellular structure of Fc gamma RII. Studies of the affinity and specificity of binding of mouse Ig classes to these receptors defined functional regions of Fc gamma RI and showed some surprising results. After removal of the third extracellular domain of Fc gamma RI, the remaining two domains (domains 1 and 2) retained the capacity to bind Ig in the form of immune complexes, however, they bound monomeric IgG2a with a reduced affinity. Surprisingly, these two domains in the absence of the third domain bound not only IgG2a but also IgG1 and IgG2b, i.e., the third domain of Fc gamma RI suppresses the intrinsic capacity of the first two domains to act as a low affinity Fc gamma RII-like molecule. Linking the third extracellular domain of Fc gamma RI to the two extracellular domains of Fc gamma RII resulted in a receptor that retained the specificity and affinity of Fc gamma RII. Thus, the removal of domain 3 from Fc gamma RI resulted in the conversion of Fc gamma RI to an \"Fc gamma RII-like\" receptor. These findings indicate that domains 1 and 2 of Fc gamma RI form an Ig-binding motif, and although domain 3 is not essential for Fc binding by Fc gamma RI, it plays a crucial role in determining the specific high affinity interaction of Fc gamma RI with IgG2a.\r"

The half-life of C1 in human serum was approximately 15 h at 37 degrees C. This half-life was markedly extended by dilution with C1-depleted serum, and an extrapolated upper limit of 40 to 50 h was reached at infinite dilution. Thus, the spontaneous activation of C1 in serum appeared to involve a dilution-sensitive reaction as well as a dilution-insensitive, first order reaction. A reaction mechanism was developed combining: 1) first order spontaneous activation of C1; 2) second order, C1-catalyzed activation of C1; and 3) second order inactivation of C1 by C1-inhibitor. A steady state equation was derived from this reaction mechanism, which provided a reasonable fit to the experimental data. The equation predicts that when the C1-inhibitor concentration decreases so that the steady state condition is lost, the concentration of C1 builds up quickly, and activation of most of the C1 occurs rapidly.\r"

  ".U": "91366143\r", 
  ".W": "The group of leukocyte integrins CD11a-c/CD18 coordinate disparate adhesion reactions in the immune system through a regulated process of ligand recognition. The participation of the receptor divalent ion binding site(s) in this mechanism of ligand binding has been investigated. As compared with other divalent cations, Mn2+ ions have the unique property to dramatically stimulate the adhesive functions of the leukocyte integrin CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1), expressed on myelo-monocytic cells. This is reflected in a three- to fivefold increased early monocyte adhesion (less than 20 min) to resting, unperturbed endothelial cells, and increased association of CD11b/CD18 with its soluble ligands fibrinogen and factor X. CD11b/CD18 ligand recognition in the presence of Mn2+ ions is specific, time and concentration dependent, and inhibited by anti-CD11b mAb. At variance with Ca(2+)-containing reactions where CD11b/CD18 functions as an inducible receptor activated by adenine nucleotides or chemoattractants, Mn2+ ions induce per se a constitutive maximal ligand binding capacity of CD11b/CD18, that is not further modulated by cell stimulation. Rather than quantitative changes in surface density, Mn2+ ions increase the affinity of CD11b/CD18 for its complementary ligands up to 10-fold, as judged by Scatchard plot analysis of receptor:ligand interaction under these conditions. Furthermore, monocyte exposure to Mn2+ ions induces the expression of activation-dependent neo-antigenic epitopes on CD11b/CD18, selectively recognized by mAb 7E3. These data suggest that in addition to cell-activating stimuli, favorable engagement of divalent ion binding site(s) can provide an alternative pathway to rapidly regulate the receptor affinity of leukocyte integrins.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of carbobenzyloxy-leucine-tyrosine-chloromethylketone (zLYCK), an inhibitor of chymotrypsin, were investigated on the activation pathways of the human neutrophil respiratory burst. At 10 microM zLYCK, a parallel inhibition was observed of superoxide production stimulated with the chemo-attractant FMLP and of chymotrypsin-like activity of human neutrophils. By contrast, superoxide production induced by PMA was minimally affected by zLYCK. The known transduction pathways triggered by FMLP were analyzed. zLYCK did not affect either the FMLP-induced cytosolic free calcium transient, inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate formation, nor the PMA-induced phosphorylation of the 47-kDa substrate of protein kinase C. zLYCK did not affect the activity of protein kinase C extracted from neutrophils. In Ca(2+)-depleted cells, in which phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate breakdown does not occur, zLYCK inhibited the FMLP-induced respiratory burst in cells primed by low doses of PMA. The activity of the NADPH oxidase tested with active membranes from stimulated neutrophils or in a cell-free system was not inhibited by zLYCK. We conclude that: 1) zLYCK inhibits superoxide production through the inhibition of a chymotrypsin-like protease of the neutrophil, 2) zLYCK inhibits FMLP-induced activation of NADPH oxidase through a pathway independent of PtdInsP2 breakdown and cytosolic free calcium, and 3) zLYCK may prove a useful probe for the characterization of its target protease in neutrophil activation.\r"

We now report the effect of IL-8 upon HRF-, connective tissue activating peptide III (CTAP III)-, and IL-3-induced histamine release from human basophils. We determined that IL-8 itself, at concentrations between 10(-7) to 10(-11) M, does not release histamine from basophils, although positive results are observed in two of 26 subjects at 10(-7) M. Unfractionated (crude) HRF released histamine in 25 of 26 donors, in the range of 6.7% to 100% of total basophil histamine stores. When basophils were preincubated with IL-8 (10(-7) to 10(-11) M) for 5 min, followed by a 40-min incubation with HRF, histamine release was significantly inhibited in 20 of 25 donors. Inhibition was observed at as little as 10(-11) M IL-8, with maximal inhibition being attained at 10(-9) M. HRF-containing supernatants contain a mixture of different histamine-releasing moieties. To better define which factor(s) may be inhibited by IL-8, fractionated supernatants, purified CTAP III, and IL-3 were studied. Histamine release produced by two different HRF-containing chromatographic fractions (HRFvoid and HRFpeak 2) and purified CTAP-III (5 micrograms/ml) was inhibited by IL-8 in 10 of 12 donors, three of three donors, and seven of 10 donors, respectively. IL-3 (5000 U/ml)-dependent histamine release was inhibited by IL-8 in all subjects tested. In contrast, histamine release by anti-IgE and FMLP was not affected by IL-8. Thus, IL-8 appears to be an inhibitor of cytokine-like molecules that induce histamine release and may represent the previously described 8-kDa histamine release inhibitory factor present in mononuclear cell supernatants.\r"

Our more recent studies demonstrating that mAb with specificity for this 80-kDa protein will act as an agonist in mediating macrophage activation have established that this protein serves as a specific receptor for LPS. In the experiments reported here, we have more accurately determined the apparent molecular mass of this protein to be 73 kDa (p73). We have also extended the sources of LPS-derivatized photo-cross-linking preparations (including Re-LPS) to determine generality of LPS binding to this receptor. Binding to the p73 LPS receptor is demonstrated with all of the LPS derivatives synthesized in our laboratory, as well as probes synthesized by other investigators. Binding of S-LPS is readily inhibited by Re chemotype LPS, and we have shown that this competitive inhibition is most likely not the result of formation of LPS aggregates. These results confirm and extend our earlier studies suggesting that the binding of LPS to the p73 receptor is lipid A specific. We further demonstrate that, in contrast to results published in a recent report, the p73 LPS receptor has no significant binding specificity for a variety peptidoglycan polymer preparations. Finally, we show that this LPS receptor can be detected on murine fibroblast, macrophage, and mastocytoma cell lines. Differences have been observed in the level of expression of LPS receptors on the various cell lines studied.\r"

Jurkat cells respond to anti-CD3 with Ca2+ mobilization, PKC activation, induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of newly characterized lymphoid microtubule associated protein-2 kinase (MAP-2K). MAP-2K itself is a 43-kDa phosphoprotein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation for activation. Although ligation of the CD3 receptor in HPB-ALL could stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of a 59- kDa substrate, there was no associated induction of [Ca2+]i flux, PKC, or MAP-2K activation. A specific PKC agonist, PMA, which bypasses the CD3 receptor, could, however, activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL cells. This implies that defective stimulation of PKC by the CD3 receptor is responsible for its failure to activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL. The defect in PKC activation is likely distal to the CD3 receptor as A1F14- failed to activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL but was effective in Jurkat cells. The stimulatory effect of PMA on MAP-2K activity in HPB-ALL was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of this kinase which implies that PKC may, in some way, regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP-2K. A candidate for this role is pp56lck which underwent posttranslational modification (seen as mobility change on SDS-PAGE) during anti-CD3 and PMA stimulation in Jurkat or PMA treatment in HPB-ALL. There was, in fact, exact coincidence between induction of PKC activity, posttranslational modification of lck and tyrosine phosphorylation/activation of MAP-2K. Lck kinase activity in an immune complex kinase assay was unchanged during PMA treatment. An alternative explanation is that modification of lck may alter its substrate profile. We therefore looked at the previously documented ability of PKC to dissociate lck from the CD4 receptor and found that PMA could reduce the stoichiometry of the lck interaction with CD4 in HPB-ALL and to a lesser extent in Jurkat cells. These results imply the existence of a kinase cascade that is initiated by PKC and, in the course of which, lck and MAP-2K may interact.\r"

We studied the effects of CsA, CsD, and CsH on human neutrophil activation induced by chemoattractants and by various substances that circumvent receptor stimulation. CsH inhibited superoxide (O2-) formation induced by the chemotactic peptide, FMLP (30 nM), with a half-maximal effect at 40 nM. O2- formation was abolished by CsH at 1 microM. CsH increased the concentration of FMLP causing half-maximal activation of O2- formation from 30 nM to 0.8 microM and substantially reduced the stimulatory effect of FMLP at supra-maximally effective concentrations. The inhibitory effect of CsH on O2- formation was evident immediately after addition to neutrophils. CsH also markedly inhibited the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), beta-glucuronidase, and lysozyme release and aggregation stimulated by FMLP. CsA and CsD were considerably less effective than CsH to inhibit FMLP-induced O2- formation. CsA and CsD were without effect on exocytosis, rises in [Ca2+]i, and aggregation induced by the chemotactic peptide. Cyclosporines inhibited FMLP-induced O2- formation in an additive manner, indicating that they acted through a mechanism they had in common. Cyclosporines only slightly inhibited O2- formation and lysozyme release induced by C5a. Aggregation and rises in [Ca2+]i stimulated by C5a were not affected by cyclosporines, and they did not inhibit O2- formation and exocytosis induced by platelet-activating factor and leukotriene B4. Cyclosporines partially inhibited O2- formations induced by NaF and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane. CsA marginally inhibited PMA-induced O2- formation and lysozyme release. CsA, CsD, and CsH did not inhibit arachidonic acid-induced O2- formation and its potentiation by NaF or stable guanine nucleotides in a cell-free system from DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells. CsH partially inhibited binding of FML [3H]P to formyl peptide receptors in membranes from DMSO- or dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells. Our data show that: 1) cyclosporines differentially inhibit activation of human neutrophils; and 2) CsH is, indeed, not immunologically inactive but is a potent and effective inhibitor of FMLP-induced O2- formation. 3) CsH interferes with agonist binding to formyl peptide receptors and in addition, cyclosporines may also act at sites distal to chemoattractant receptors.\r"

Using a B10 series of congenic mice we found that the repertoire of antibody responses was under H-2 gene control, and that non-H2 genes were also involved. By Western blotting, differences in the number and m.w. of proteins recognised by mice of different genetic background were apparent. Such differences were also reflected in the total antibody response to a soluble extract of M. leprae (M. leprae sonicate), as measured by ELISA. Concentrating on one particular Ag, the 65-kDa heat shock protein, we found that all strains of mice developed antibodies following immunization with the purified recombinant protein, although there was a continuous distribution in the titer of antibodies obtained, with differences between individual strains indicating both H-2 and non-H-2 effects. Using a library of overlapping peptides based on the amino acid sequence of this protein, we have mapped the B cell epitopes in the different strains of mice. H-2 genes had no effect on the structure and number of epitopes recognized, although this was influenced by non-H-2 genes. There was a high level of concordance between actual epitopes recognized and those predicted by calculations of antigenic index, and B cell epitopes were located in similar positions to previously determined T cell epitopes.\r"

Induction was studied by measuring the secretion of biologically active TNF and by measuring the activity of the reporter enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) produced within macrophages transfected with an endotoxin-responsive CAT construct. Several lines of evidence indicated that the induction of TNF and CAT was attributable to the spirochete lipoproteins rather than to contaminating or endogenous LPS: 1) the dose response curves observed for the lipoproteins were markedly different from those obtained with LPS; 2) lipoprotein-mediated activation was unaffected by amounts of polymyxin B that completely neutralized the induction of TNF and CAT by LPS, 3) low concentrations of the lipoproteins induced TNF in macrophages from endotoxin-unresponsive C3H/HeJ mice as effectively as in macrophages from normal C3H/HeN mice, and 4) isolated spirochete lipoproteins, but not a non-lipoprotein immunogen, were potent inducers of CAT in the transformed macrophages. Moreover, LPS was not detected in the B. burgdorferi lipoprotein mixtures by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Proteolytic digestion of the intact bacterial protein preparations only modestly diminished their ability to activate the cells, suggesting that small lipopeptides comprise the biologically active portions of the molecules, as is the case with the murein lipoprotein of Escherichia coli. Through their ability to induce TNF production by macrophages, spirochete lipoproteins may play important roles in the development of the local inflammatory changes and the systemic manifestations that characterize syphilis and Lyme disease.\r"

In order to identify such Ag, we have constructed a T. gondii cDNA library in the cloning/expression vector lambda gt11, screened this library with a pool of sera of immune donors, and further screened the set of selected recombinant Ag using, as probe, a T. gondii-reactive T-cell clone (TCC) derived from an infected/immune individual and producing a high level of IFN-gamma. One recombinant Ag was shown to induce TCC proliferation and was characterized. The corresponding mature T. gondii Ag has an apparent molecular mass of 54 kDa and the sequence of the cDNA clone suggests that it is membrane associated. The epitope defined by the TCC on this Ag was found to be present in three Toxoplasma strains independently of their phenotype (virulent or cyst forming). Recognition of this Ag by the TCC was shown to be restricted by HLA-DPw4, the most frequent allele in the Caucasian population (approximately 40%). The use of this Ag as a vaccine component is proposed.\r"

A region recognized by a neutralizing mAb is also recognized by sera from chronically infected or immunized mice but is not bound by sera from mice infected for 15 days. Infection in mice, despite the presence of early Osp-A antibody, may therefore be explained in part by the lack of response to this epitope. Sera from infected humans recognizes this region, although in this case the immune response to Osp-A occurs only late in infection. Nonetheless, the fact that both human sera and sera from mice immunized with Osp-A bind a conformationally dependent epitope that localizes to the same region tentatively suggests that humans are able to respond to a protective epitope and that an Osp-A-based vaccine may elicit protective immunity in humans.\r"

The results of comparative analysis of the specificity of mAb-CL and the panel of mAb kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Barbaree (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA) allowed us to recommend mAb-CL to be used as a diagnostic tool to reveal the pathogenicity of L. pneumophila strains of serogroup 1. Hybridomas were also raised in a syngenic system which produced anti-idiotypic mAb (mAb2) against anti-CL mAb B6/1. The Ab2 belonged to Ab2 gamma type: 1) Ab2 reacted with B6/1 Id only, 2) Ab2 inhibited the interaction of B6/1 Ab1 with CL, and 3) CL inhibited the reaction of Ab2 with Ab1. The use of Ab2 allowed us to show that B6/1 Id is expressed in 4 to 32% of serum antibodies during the primary and secondary immune responses of BALB/c mice to CL. Ab2 induced the production of anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3) in BALB/c mice, and some of them reacted with CL. Thus, we have demonstrated the possibility of inducing an antibody response to CL (one of the main L. pneumophila pathogenic factors) in intact syngenic mice with anti-idiotypic antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "A segmental analysis of the key regions of HLA-DR1 that control T cell allorecognition was performed by using a series of transfected cell lines expressing the products of recombinant DRB/H-2Eb genes, paired with either DR alpha or H-2E alpha. Four of eight human T cell clones tolerated substitution of the H-2E alpha chain, but only one clone showed any response to the DR alpha/H-2E beta k dimer. Both the membrane-proximal and the membrane-distal domains of the beta-chain played an important part in stimulating these clones. The response of four of eight clones was markedly inhibited by substitution of the H-2E beta 2 for the DR beta 2 domain. This inhibition showed a complete correlation with the sensitivity of the clones to inhibition by anti-CD4 mAb. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction site for CD4 may include residues on the beta 2-domain. Introduction of H-2Ek sequence into either half of the beta 1-domain led to a complete loss of response by all but two of the clones. This is consistent with these clones having dual specificity for exposed DR1-specific polymorphisms and for DR1-bound peptides. The pattern of response of one of the clones suggested that indirect conformational effects on the alpha 1-domain may also contribute to the influence of the amino-terminal half of the beta 1-domain on T cell recognition. In the presence of H-2E alpha, this clone responded more strongly when the amino-terminal half of the beta 1-domain was of H-2Ek rather than DR1 sequence. This implies that species matching of the floor of the beta 1-domain with the alpha-chain is more important than the presence of the alpha-chain of the parental species.\r"

Raised against a human monoclonal IgM with rheumatoid factor activity, Lc1 detects a major cross-reactive Id (CRI) present on the H chain of many monoclonal IgM autoantibodies. In contrast to other major autoantibody-CRI investigated to date, we note that the Lc1-CRI is expressed by subpopulation of cells in the germinal centers, as well as in the mantle zones, of secondary human B cell follicles. To examine the molecular basis for Lc1 expression, we used the polymerase chain reaction to isolate the functionally rearranged Ig VH genes of monoclonal Lc1-reactive B cell populations from six unrelated patients with CLL or SLL. Although the neoplastic B cells from most patients with CLL or SLL express the CD5 surface differentiation Ag, the lymphoma cells from one patient with SLL were CD5-negative. We find that the Lc1-reactive cells from each cell population have Ig rearrangements involving a VH gene of the VH4 subgroup. However, the VH4 genes rearranged in different Lc1-reactive tumor populations may originate from at least two disparate germ-line VH4 genes. Also, in contrast to the CD5-positive tumor populations, we find evidence for intraclonal diversity in the functionally rearranged VH4 genes of the CD5-negative SLL. Collectively, this study discerns a degeneracy in the VH4 genes that can encode the Lc1 CRI, indicating the term \"supratypic cross-reactive idiotype\" may best describe the specificity of the Lc1 mAb. Also, this study suggests that expression of CD5 may delineate categories of B cell SLL that differ in their relative rates of constitutive Ig V gene somatic mutation.\r"

All Ab2 were idiotypically cross-reactive and combining site-specific as demonstrated by competitive cross-inhibition studies and their ability to inhibit the binding of MEM136 to the melanoma cells, Colo38. However, only two Ab2, IM32 and IM06, were able to induce specific anti-TAA-specific (Ab1') responses in rabbits. When IM32 and IM06 were tested in allogeneic stains of mice for the induction of anti-MPG responses, only IM32 produced an Ab1' response. In mice, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 is idiotypically cross-reactive with its Ab1. Furthermore, the IM32-induced murine Ab3 and MEM136 recognized a similar MPG epitope on the melanoma cells because the Ab3 inhibited the binding of MEM136 to melanoma cells. The Ab3 induced by IM32 and IM06 in rabbits also recognized a similar epitope as the Ab1. In rabbits, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 and IM06 were idiotypically cross-reactive with each other. However, additional studies indicated that the majority of Ab3 induced by IM32 were IM32 Id-specific and lacked IM06 idiotopes. Further experimentation indicated that IM32-induced rabbit Ab3 were biologically active as demonstrated by the ability of the Ab3 to inhibit melanoma cell invasion in a Matrigel assay.\r"

While there is increasing research on women with this disease, less is known about their male sexual partners. METHODS. Male patients whose female sexual partners had been diagnosed as having anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia were recruited for the study. The genital regions of the male patients were examined and biopsied with the aid of a colposcope after application of a 5% acetic acid solution. Treatment was based on the specific findings in each patient. RESULTS. Genital lesions were found on 65% of the male patients examined, even though no disease had been detected by the individual. Seventy-nine percent of patients who were compliant with the prescribed treatment protocol had no detectable HPV-related lesions at the time of their last androscopic examination. CONCLUSIONS. Magnified examination of the male genitalia using an androscope following the application of 5% acetic acid solution is an effective method by which the primary care physician can detect and treat male HPV-related anogenital lesions.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. One of the chief barriers to a greater use of hepatitis B vaccine is the high cost of the vaccine itself. A number of small research trials have shown that an adequate immune response can be induced at a much lower cost by administering one tenth of the vaccine using an intradermal technique. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether these results could be replicated in a larger clinical trial. METHODS. Vaccine recipients included health care providers, police officers, and firefighters. Recipients were given 0.1 mL of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine intradermally on days 1, 30, and 180. Antibody response was measured on day 210, with seroconversion defined as a sample-to-negative (S/N) ratio of greater than or equal to 10. Any local and systemic side effects were documented. RESULTS. Six hundred sixteen individuals completed the vaccination series, and seroconversion occurred in 534 (86.7%). The rate of seroconversion in those younger than 40 years was 91.2% and in those 40 years and older was 75.1%. The mean S/N ratio was 154.9 (range 0 to 620) and decreased with increasing age (r = -.25, P = .0001). Side effects were largely limited to local reactions. CONCLUSIONS. The results support the use of the intradermal technique as a cost-effective alternative to the intramuscular route in individuals younger than 40 years. The intradermal technique may be used in older individuals if titers are obtained to assure seroconversion. Because of the restricted availability of the plasma-derived vaccine used in this study, similar trials with recombinant vaccine should be undertaken.\r"

The objectives of this study were (1) to estimate the prevalence of previously unknown diabetes mellitus in an apparently healthy population aged 40 years and older, (2) to estimate the ratio of known to unknown diabetics, and (3) from this information, to estimate the true prevalence of diabetes. METHODS. A one in five random sample of healthy patients aged 40 years and older attending six rural family physician offices had their fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level tested with a reflectance glucometer. If the FPG was greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol/L (140.5 mg/dL), a second FPG test was done on a later day. RESULTS. The sample of 1264 patients contained 139 known patients with diabetes. Of the remaining 1125 patients, 936 (83%) were tested. Twenty-three patients had an elevated FPG level on the first test, but only nine of them had an elevated FPG level on the second test. One new patient with diabetes was found for each 15 patients already diagnosed; thus, the prevalence of unknown diabetes in the study population was 0.7%. As a result of this survey, the estimated prevalence of diabetes in the population age 40 years and older rose from 11.0% to 11.7%, and the estimated prevalence for the entire population rose from 4.4% to 4.6%. CONCLUSIONS. Routine screening for diabetes mellitus in otherwise healthy patients aged 40 years and older is not worthwhile. Such screening should be restricted to high-risk groups.\r"

This study explores relationships between alcohol levels at admission to a detoxification unit and the severity and outcome of alcohol withdrawal. METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in two institutions, the Mid-Missouri Mental Health Center (MMMHC) and the Harry S Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital (HSTMVH), of individuals admitted during 1 year. RESULTS. The alcohol levels at admission of the 86 clients at the Mental Health Center and the 99 patients at the HSTMVH, correlated with withdrawal severity over the first 48 hours after admission (R2 = .26 at MMMHC, .41 at HSTMVH, P less than .0001 for both), and remained significantly associated even after adjustment for other variables. Furthermore, individuals who had lower alcohol levels at the time of admission were more likely to stay for rehabilitation following detoxification (P less than .001 for both institutions). CONCLUSIONS. A patient's alcohol level at the time of admission to a detoxification unit may help predict the severity of withdrawal and the treatment outcome.\r"

However, few studies have focused specifically on koilocytotic (KC) atypia. Given the increasing frequency of reporting KC atypia on Papanicolaou smears, we sought to obtain more information on the relationship between Papanicolaou smears and subsequent colposcopically directed cervical biopsies. METHODS. Retrospectively, we compared the Papanicolaou smears and colposcopically guided biopsy results for 132 college women who had abnormal Papanicolaou smears (KC, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN], or reactive atypia [RA]). Data were compiled through systematic review of the charts of these women. The cervical biopsies were taken 6 months or less after the Papanicolaou smears. RESULTS. Of 99 women having only KC atypia on cytology, histology revealed concordance in 51 cases and underlying dysplasia in 16 cases. Only one biopsy revealed CIN III, and no biopsies showed invasive carcinoma. We also noted variation in the histologic results between the laboratories that analyzed the biopsy specimens. In comparing the biopsy results after one or two KC atypic Papanicolaou smears 6 months or less apart, we found no statistically significant difference. CONCLUSIONS. These findings suggest that physicians who obtain an initial Papanicolaou smear read as KC atypia could obtain a second smear 3 months later to determine if there is persistent KC atypia before advising a patient to have cervical biopsy. In addition, physicians also should know the limitations of the laboratories providing them with information.\r"

When properly organized and conducted, the preseason physical examination process for scholastic athletes can identify existing medical and musculoskeletal problems as well as provide for age-specific anticipatory guidance. This examination may also present an ideal opportunity to screen for adolescent hyperlipidemia. METHODS. Seven-hundred seventy-seven (777) students, aged 11 to 15 years, from seven junior high schools received fingerstick cholesterol screening during a complete preseason physical examination. Elevated values were verified by repeat examination. Values were compared with previously published national norms for this age group. All students received information on cholesterol, and the parents and pediatrician or family physician of those with confirmed positive tests (higher than 4.8 mmol/L [185 mg/dL]) were notified. RESULTS. One hundred fourteen (114), or approximately 15%, of the subjects were found to have elevated cholesterol levels. Of the 74 who returned for a second test, 38 (51%) were confirmed as having elevated cholesterol levels. Feedback from parents, principals, and coaches regarding the value of the screening and the associated education was overwhelmingly positive. CONCLUSIONS. In our experience, the precompetition examination provides an opportunity to screen for elevated cholesterol levels and to educate young people about hyperlipidemia.\r"

Our analysis confirms the absence of a predictive risk factor association in the case of men previously indicated by Framingham investigators. The published declarations by Framingham investigators of an absence of association between cigarette smoking and angina pectoris in Framingham women, is a failure to publicly recognize the distinctive negative association present in the Framingham female data. The Framingham data on the relationship of smoking to angina incidence is clearly at variance with the Surgeon General's sketchy finding of an inconsistent positive association for men and an uncertain relationship for women. It is suggested that special attention should be directed to these results of the Framingham data because of the preeminence of Framingham material world wide, because angina pectoris is the most common manifestation of coronary heart disease, because it will improve the \"conventional wisdom\" on this subject, and because the negative relationship found for Framingham women does not lend support to the belief held by some that smoking enhances the degree of coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

The diagnostic information on cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disorders showed considerable agreement, ranging from 65 to over 90% correspondence across the two data sets. Certain conditions noted by the anesthesiologist were often absent from the claims data; cardiovascular disease was recorded in the clinical data but absent from the claims for 31% of prostatectomy and 17% of cholecystectomy cases. Such patients were less likely to have been assigned a high score on the ASA Physical Status measure or to have high-risk diagnoses on the hospital file. Similar findings resulted from comparing the two sources in their ability to predict such adverse outcomes as mortality and readmission to hospital: the anesthesia file generally included less serious comorbidity.\r"

The patients with low SES (social classes IV and V according to the British Registrar General's classification) were older (62.0 v 58.5 years old, p less than 0.0001) and showed a higher ICU mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 1.61, p = 0.0204) and severity of illness on admission (mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score [SAPS] 9.9 vs 8.7, p = 0.0002) than patients with high SES (social classes I-III). The initial severity of illness differential was detected both in patients admitted from the emergency area and in patients admitted from the general hospitalization ward, suggesting the existence of some kind of preselection procedure related to the SES of the patient. The stepwise logistic regression analysis identified as independent predictive variables of ICU mortality therapeutic effort (measured with the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System [TISS]), SAPS score, age and hospital, but not SES. The TISS/SAPS ratio according to origin of patients (emergency/general wards) was comparable in the high and low SES. We conclude that there is an inverse relationship between SES and ICU mortality. The mortality excess in the low SES patients is largely accounted for by the covariates of the low SES (especially their high age and severity of illness on admission). There is no evidence of a different relative therapeutic effort according to the SES.\r"

Sensitivity and specificity values vary widely, ranging between 89-100% sensitivity and 67-100% specificity. To examine this variation, a regression model is tested that explains specificity as a function of the year the study was published, the population being sampled, and a quality rating. The model explains 29% of the total variation. The most significant determinant of specificity is the type of population sampled; studies with low prevalence samples have higher specificity. This study demonstrated that meta-analysis can be used to synthesize literature on technologies, and that regression analysis can be used to examine the sources of variation that meta-analysis uncovers. It also demonstrates the need for studies of test performance to use standardized research procedures and to fully report their methods and results.\r"

We studied the morbidity and mortality due to subarachnoid hemorrhage among 42,862 men and women aged 20-69 years who had participated in a large health survey in Finland. During a mean follow-up of 12 years, 102 non-fatal and 85 fatal cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage were observed. The total incidence was 37 per 100,000 person-years. Smoking and hypertension were positively associated and body mass index was inversely associated with the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. These associations were not confounded by age or each other. No statistically significant association with risk was detected for serum cholesterol level, hematocrit content, known heart disease, or diabetes. The risk was especially elevated among lean hypertensive subjects and lean smoking subjects. The age-adjusted relative risks of subarachnoid hemorrhage for lean, hypertensive smokers were 18.3 (95% confidence interval (CI), 7.8-42.7) among women and 6.7 (95% CI, 2.3-19.7) among men as compared to the risk among subjects without these risk factors. We conclude that modifiable risk factors are predictive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, for which reason subarachnoid hemorrhage may in part be preventable. Leanness combined with arterial hypertension and/or smoking, in particular, poses a substantially elevated risk.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have found an inverse relation between alcohol use and clinical gallstone disease, suggestive of a protective effect of alcohol use. However, such an inverse relation may (at least partly) be explained by a reduction of alcohol use because of symptoms related to clinical gallstone disease (protopathic bias). We empirically evaluated the consequences of different designs for the avoidance of such bias in a series of case-control studies. A first study deliberately used a design that is commonly seen in the literature. Cases of clinical gallstone disease, referred to hospital because of symptoms, were contrasted with general population controls. The results suggested an inverse relation between alcohol use and gallstones. Next, three alternative case-control studies were performed using designs that safeguard against protopathic bias. In none of these studies was an association between alcohol use and gallstones found. This demonstrates the probable existence of protopathic bias in case-control studies on alcohol use and gallstones. It is argued that earlier non-experimental studies on this topic were susceptible to such bias. This has most likely led to an overestimation of the protective effect.\r"

Coefficients of intraindividual variation (CVa) were calculated from individual regressions on time. The lowest CVa was found for the summary index including fasting glucose (area under the curve, AUC): 10.0 +/- 4.9%. For fasting and 30, 60, and 120 min glucose the values ranged from 12 to 18%. The CVa's were not associated with age, gender, drug use, and disease prevalence, and may also be applied to other populations. The reliability coefficient depended on the prevalence of diabetes in the population and was higher than observed in younger populations. The highest reliability coefficient was observed for AUC: 0.81. For the combined information of OGTT, reflected by AUC or by classification according to WHO criteria, the variability was comparable to that of other cardiovascular risk factors such as serum total cholesterol.\r"

We conducted pilot studies of the fundamental mathematical processes of this method using data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging. First we constructed prototypic mathematical models of the probabilities of remaining functionally able and of making transitions to disability and to death within 2 years. Then we used these models to project hypothetical rates of transition for white women of selected ages, morbidity ratings and health statuses.\r"

We investigated this interaction by administering 15 micrograms of epinephrine intravenously to 6 healthy volunteers 39 to 48 years old before and after beta-blockade, accomplished by intravenous injection of propranolol, 0.04 mg/kg. Epinephrine administration caused a 20 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) increase in heart rate before beta-blockade but a 38 +/- 3% reduction after beta-blockade. The lowest heart rate recorded was 28 beats/min. We conclude that, in middle-aged beta-blocked men, intravenous injection of a standard epinephrine-containing test dose will predictably cause significant hypertension followed by marked bradycardia.\r"

Standards, guidelines, laboratory and field testing, and engineering discipline are all proposed methods for improving the human engineering of devices. New microprocessor technology offers designers great flexibility in the design of devices, but this flexibility is often coupled with complexity and more elaborate user interaction. Guidelines and standards usually do not capture these features of new equipment, in part because technology improvements occur faster than meaningful guidelines can be developed. Professional human engineering of new devices relies on a broad, user-centered approach to design and evaluation. Used in the framework of current knowledge about human operator performance, these techniques offer guidance to new equipment designers and to purchasers and users of these devices.\r"

We first evaluated the devices during normoxia, hyperoxia, and anoxia in vitro, using a transcutaneous PO2 electrode (PtcO2) as the reference. The responses to normoxia and to different grades of hyperoxia were examined in vivo in 8 healthy volunteers to assess the relationship between changes in subcutaneous PO2 and PtcO2, an estimate of arterial PO2 (PaO2). One subcutaneous method (ScA) used a technique based on a polarographic needle electrode in situ connected to an ammeter; the second method (ScB) was based on a blood gas analyzer system first described by Hunt (Lancet 164;2:1370). ScA and PtcO2 both responded to stepwise changes in ambient oxygen concentration (21-100%) in vitro within 10 seconds; the 95% RT of ScA was 1.39 +/- 0.5 to 2.39 +/- 0.8 minutes and that of PtcO2 was 0.32 +/- 0.1 to 0.49 +/- 0.1 minutes. ScB had a lag of 3 minutes, and the 95% RT was 6.75 +/- 0.5 to 8.2 +/- 0.8 minutes. In contrast to the results in vitro, the response of ScA to changes in FiO2 in vivo was delayed compared with the rapid response of PtcO2, reflecting the physiologic delay of tissue PO2 in response to increased PaO2. The time lag and the long 95% RT of ScB were even more evident in vivo. ScA reacted three to four times faster than ScB, both in vitro and in vivo, to changes in the oxygen environment. The in vitro 95% RT of ScA to changes in ambient oxygen varied from 2 to 3.5 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such monitoring requires catheters from patient to spectrometer that are several meters long. Scamman (J Clin Monit 1988; 4:227-229) found that when the respiratory frequency is high, as with infants, the CO2 signal from the patient is unacceptably distorted during passage down the catheter. This is due to Taylor dispersion of the input signal. An outline of the theory of Taylor dispersion is given. The equations describe the interaction between the velocity distribution (which, in laminar flow, is parabolic) and the radial diffusion of CO2. This interaction keeps a tracer signal together in a pulse, as it moves down the tube with the mean velocity, spreading somewhat as it proceeds. How much does an initially sharp signal become blurred? The spread of such a signal when it reaches the detector, measured in time, can be expressed in various ways. Measurement is complicated, however, by the fact that the gas pressure may fall by as much as a factor of 10 along the line. The resultant expansion and acceleration of the gas cannot be ignored. A full treatment of this complication is given elsewhere, but the following simple equation is described: delta t = 3.54 x 10(-3) l [(1 + R2)/(1 - R2)]1/2. Typically, the spread time is up to a quarter of a second for catheters of 50 m, such as used by Scamman. This is comparable with the period of CO2 rise and fall for infants and explains the serious distortion in wave form that Scamman+ found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The Ohmeda 2120 noninvasive blood pressure monitor uses the oscillometric technique, but it also includes a \"Sys Stat\" mode for rapid determination of systolic blood pressure up to ten times per minute. This Sys Stat mode uses the \"return-to-flow\" method, in which the pressure on an upper arm cuff decreases in small steps until a finger sensor detects the first pulse of blood. Data from 16 patients monitored with the Ohmeda 2120 unit and with an arterial cannula were analyzed. The line of regression was Sys Stat = 0.85 (arterial) + 9.49. The Ohmeda 2120 monitor tended to underestimate the arterial pressure, particularly at higher pressures. Several factors could have contributed to this underestimation. Even so, the accuracy is sufficient for clinical use under most circumstances. More importantly, in an urgent situation, the Sys Stat mode can provide a reading of systolic blood pressure within seconds.\r"

We prospectively evaluated the intraoperative failure rate of our pulse oximeters at the four University of Washington Hospitals (University of Washington Medical Center, Veterans Affairs Medical Center [VAMC], Children's Hospital and Medical Center, and Harborview Medical Center [HMC]) recorded from April 1989 to August 1989. We defined failure as the inability to obtain any oximetry reading for a cumulative period of more than 30 minutes during any anesthetic procedure after all equipment malfunctions had been eliminated. Our puse oximeters failed in 124 of 11,046 cases studied; this is a failure rate of 1.12%, which ranged from 0.56% at HMC to 4.24% at VAMC. The failure rate at VAMC (4.24%) was significantly higher than the other hospitals (p less than 0.001). Those cases associated with the pulse oximeter failure had the following characteristics: (1) an ASA status of 3 or higher, (2) lengthy operations, and (3) elderly patients. When the device did fail in a patient, it did not function for 32% of the mean anesthesia time. We conclude that the intraoperative use of the pulse oximetry can provide information about blood oxygen saturation in most patients. However, in approximately 1% of the patients we studied in the operating room, mechanically functioning pulse oximeters failed to provide readings of blood oxygen saturations during routine operative use.\r"

Clear visual changes in the EEG power spectrum can be present with little or no change in univariate variable values. A method that could produce a single value based on the total data available in the EEG power spectrum would be very useful in monitoring EEG changes. Neural network analysis is a technique that can take multiple inputs and produce a single output value using complicated processing patterns that require training to establish. We examined the usefulness of a series of neural network models to classify 63 EEG patterns against sedation level in 26 mechanically ventilated patients requiring midazolam for long-term sedation. During a stable period of sedation, a 4- to 60-minute period of EEG data was obtained concurrently with a sedation level from 1 (follows commands) to 7 (no or gag response to suctioning of the endotracheal tube). The EEG power spectrum was divided into equal frequency bands, and the log absolute powers in each of these bands were used as inputs for a series of neural network models. The output target was the sedation level associated with each set of EEG data. Networks were trained on a subset of EEG power/sedation score data pairs, and the ability to classify the remaining data pairs was tested. Using a t-test comparison with a random set of sedation levels, we found that trained neural network models classified EEG patterns against sedation level successfully (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study comparing 98 patients with chronic fatigue with 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis on structured psychiatric interviews and patient questionnaires. Nineteen patients meeting CDC criteria for CFS were compared with 79 patients with chronic fatigue not meeting CDC criteria on questionnaires measuring disability and psychosocial distress. SETTING: Consecutive patients with chronic fatigue were selected from a chronic fatigue clinic at the University of Washington, and 31 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis were sampled from a private rheumatology practice. MAIN RESULTS: Patients with chronic fatigue had a significantly higher prevalence of lifetime major depression and somatization disorder than did patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with chronic fatigue also had a significantly higher prevalence of current and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Only 19 of 98 patients with chronic fatigue met CDC criteria for CFS. Patients meeting CDC criteria for CFS could not be differentiated from the larger group of patients with chronic fatigue on any study variable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic fatigue have a significantly higher burden of psychiatric illness than do patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The psychiatric illness preceded the development of chronic fatigue in over half the patients. Centers for Disease Control criteria for CFS did not select a subset of chronic fatigue patients who could be differentiated on disability or psychosocial parameters from patients with chronic fatigue who did not meet CDC criteria.\r"

DESIGN: Consecutive case series. SETTING: Four primary care sites associated with the Brown University AIDS Program. PARTICIPANTS: 140 consecutive HIV-seropositive women. RESULTS: The most common reason for HIV testing in both groups was self-perception of risk. Presenting T-helper lymphocyte counts, leukocyte counts, and hematocrits did not differ significantly between the groups. Intravenous drug users were significantly more likely than HTs to have evidence of hepatitis B virus exposure (p less than 0.0001) and to report the history of a sexually transmitted disease (p = 0.005). Twenty percent of HTs versus 10% of IVDUs were tested only after they had HIV-related symptoms. The most frequent clinical presentation for both groups was Centers for Disease Control Group IV/A constitutional symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Many HIV-seropositive women do not enter the health care system until they are symptomatic, but those infected heterosexually and those using parenteral drugs have similar laboratory indices at presentation. AIDS education strategies toward all women at risk must include information about manifestations of HIV disease in women, as well as preventive measures, to ensure early access to the health care system.\r"

SETTING: Community recruitment to a university-based teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Ten premenopausal and eight postmenopausal women with mild hypertension and unimpaired sexual function. INTERVENTION: Periodic, self-administered daily diaries assessed the sexual arousal and desire and orgasmic function of women receiving placebo, clonidine, and prazosin. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using analysis of variance for orgasmic characteristics and comparison of the percentages of yes responses to the sexual function questions, no significant difference in the levels of sexual function of women receiving placebo, clonidine, and prazosin was found. However, there was a suggestion that clonidine and prazosin affected some aspects of sexual function. Of the women who received clonidine first, fewer were receptive to partner approach during medication therapy (49%) than during placebo (61%). Fewer women wished for their partners to approach them (WISH) during therapy (41% and 53% for clonidine and prazosin, respectively) than during placebo (60%). In the group that received prazosin first, WISH was affected (32% for prazosin, 31% for clonidine, 45% for placebo). Orgasmic strength increased from 2.1 on placebo to 2.7 on clonidine (second medication), measured on a four-point Likert scale. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study developed a method using self-administered daily diaries for evaluating the effects of antihypertensive agents on sexual function in hypertensive women. These potential effects need to be evaluated in larger studies.\r"

DESIGN: Survey of patients attending ambulatory care clinics, using structured personal interviews. SETTING: Three ambulatory care clinics serving an indigent, predominantly black population of metropolitan Atlanta: a general medical appointment clinic, a walk-in clinic, and a neighborhood primary care clinic. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Patients over the age of 18 who attended one of the above clinics on a day when interviewers were available and who were estimated to have more than a 45-minute wait prior to seeing their health provider. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 15.3% of subjects had CAGE scores greater than or equal to 2 (95% CI 12.2, 19.0). A CAGE score of greater than or equal to 2 was almost three times more common in men than in women, 26.7% vs. 9.5%. Only 8.6% (95% CI 6.3, 11.7) of subjects reported drinking greater than or equal to 2 drinks per day. These findings suggest that problem drinking may affect as many as one in six people seeking care in inner-city ambulatory care clinics and provide support for the use of screening instruments such as the CAGE questionnaire for improved sensitivity in detecting alcoholism in these practice settings.\r"

PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 237 Caucasian college sophomores (COLLEGE sample) and 366 socially disadvantaged junior high school students (CORE-CITY sample) selected in 1940-43 for relative mental health and for interdisciplinary study. MAIN RESULTS: The presence of many risk factors for death, including alcohol abuse and smoking, had been assessed prior to age 47 (CORE-CITY sample) and age 52 (COLLEGE sample). Over the next 12 years (CORE-CITY sample) and the next 16 years (COLLEGE sample), the men's mortality was monitored. Heavy use of cigarettes and alcohol abuse were highly correlated. When the effect of alcohol abuse was controlled, heavy smoking was associated with elevated mortality risks in both samples, although this was not statistically significant in the CORE-CITY sample. When smoking was controlled, the odds ratios for mortality from alcohol abuse were substantial in both samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results and a literature review suggest that insufficient alcohol abuse histories may lead clinicians to underestimate the mortality risk of alcohol abuse.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of an episode of serious cardiovascular disease on smoking behavior and to identify factors associated with smoking cessation in this setting. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in which smokers admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) were followed for one year after hospital discharge to determine subsequent smoking behavior. SETTING: Coronary care unit of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Preadmission smoking status was assessed in all 828 patients admitted to the CCU during one year. The 310 smokers surviving to hospital discharge were followed and their smoking behaviors assessed by self-report at six and 12 months. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Six months after discharge, 32% of survivors were not smoking; the rate of sustained cessation at one year was 25%. Smokers with a new diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) made during hospitalization had the highest cessation rate (53% vs. 31%, p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, smoking cessation was more likely if patients were discharged with a diagnosis of CHD, had no prior history of CHD, were lighter smokers (less than 1 pack/day), and had congestive heart failure during hospitalization. Among smokers admitted because of suspected myocardial infarction (MI), cessation was more likely if the diagnosis was CHD than if it was noncoronary (37% vs. 19%, p less than 0.05), but a diagnosis of MI led to no more smoking cessation than did coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization in a CCU is a stimulus to long-term smoking cessation, especially for lighter smokers and those with a new diagnosis of CHD. Admission to a CCU may represent a time when smoking habits are particularly susceptible to intervention. Smoking cessation in this setting should improve patient outcomes because cessation reduces cardiovascular mortality, even when quitting occurs after the onset of CHD.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study of patients who underwent outpatient management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. SETTING: Community hospital-based outpatient alcohol treatment program. PATIENTS: The 179 patients who were eligible for and participated in a clinical trial of drug therapy for outpatient management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. MAIN RESULTS: Treatment failure occurred for 45% (80/179) of the patients. Failure rating did not vary according to diverse sociodemographic features such as age, level of education, income, medical insurance status, and marital status. Persons who were homeless did as well as those who were not. In contrast, two clinical features of withdrawal were associated with significantly higher rates of treatment failure: craving and withdrawal symptom severity. High cravers had a treatment failure rate of 56% (22/39), compared with 36% (41/115) for those with lower scores (p less than 0.03). Among those with moderate-to-high withdrawal symptom severity, 49% (74/151) represented treatment failures, compared with 22% (6/27) of those in the low-symptom group (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: While these data do not confirm that socially disadvantaged persons are at increased risk for withdrawal treatment failure, two clinical features--craving and withdrawal symptom severity--may help identify high-risk patients.\r"

DESIGN: Survey using a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire. SETTING: Three university-affiliated internal medicine clinics at the University of California Irvine Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: We asked all patients on randomly selected days during the three-month study to participate. 453 (72%) of the 629 eligible English- and Spanish-speaking patients completed the questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 28% of participants had experienced domestic violence at some time in their lives, and 14% were currently experiencing domestic violence. Logistic regression analysis showed that female gender, unmarried status, and poverty were important predictors of domestic violence. However, domestic violence occurred in all groups regardless of sex, ethnicity, age, or socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: The study found an unexpectedly high prevalence of domestic violence in the three internal medicine clinics. Physicians should ask their patients routinely about domestic violence and, when domestic violence is present, should offer emotional support, information about social service agencies, and psychological care.\r"

DESIGN: Survey of selected primary care and medical sub-specialist physicians most likely to care for seriously or terminally ill patients. SETTING: Private-practice clinicians practicing in an urban county. PARTICIPANTS: Internists, family practitioners, cardiologists, oncologists, and neurologists in private practice. Interventions: None. RESULTS: Almost all responding physicians (97.2%) knew of the living will, although few (13.5%) had executed one for themselves. Most were willing to keep a copy of their patients' living wills with their office records. However, only a few physicians (20%) indicated they routinely discussed extraordinary care issues with their patients. In fact, most (70%) reported they rarely or never discussed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with their patients. With terminally ill patients, physician initiative was greater: 69% reported discussing resuscitation preferences. Comparable discussions with elderly patients were undertaken only if the physician believed they would be warranted by the clinical circumstances. When questioned about their own sentiments towards resuscitation, most physicians indicated they would not want CPR if they were terminally ill (86%) or mentally incompetent (93%). A similar number (92%) would refuse artificial feeding if permanently comatose. CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians recognize the importance of living wills as an expression of patient treatment preferences. Nevertheless, discussion of patient preferences is unlikely because of physicians' reluctance, except in limited circumstances, to initiate a dialogue about life-sustaining measures. Because patients also are often unwilling to begin such discussions, better methods of facilitating discussion of CPR and other extraordinary health care measures must be sought.\r"

DESIGN: The educational intervention supplemented an ongoing bimonthly journal club. The effects on residents were studied prospectively before and four months following the intervention. SETTING: A community hospital internal medicine training program. PARTICIPANTS: All 14 residents: six in the first year, and four each in the second and third years of training. INTERVENTION: A one-hour seminar incorporating principles of adult education, including the use of multiple teaching modalities. The content was based on the critical literature reading guidelines published by the McMaster group. Reinforcement of learning objectives was achieved by learner participation, written assignments, active feedback, and follow-up in subsequent journal clubs. RESULTS: Residents improved their performances on objective testing of critical appraisal knowledge by 60% (p = 0.02). They reported improved ability to appraise original research articles critically (p = 0.01) and reported spending more useful time reading. Unaffected were the total time spent reading journals, the reasons for reading them, and the perceived value of journals in \"keeping up\" with advances in medical knowledge. CONCLUSION: Journal clubs are important to residents, and their effectiveness in teaching critical appraisal and promoting reading of the literature may be augmented by applying principles of adult education.\r"

Age- and sex-matched healthy controls showed a similar exposure to tobacco in years and a comparable distribution of tobacco habits. Although the mean exposure factor (duration times exposure) was greater in the tumor group, no intimate correlation between lip cancer and tobacco was demonstrated. However, an increased, although small, occurrence of herpes labialis lesions was found in cancer patients.

  ".W": "The functional and cosmetic outcome of 11 patients who had anterior arch mandibulectomy for stage II-IV oral cavity carcinoma and were reconstructed with AO stainless-steel or titanium plates was retrospectively analyzed. Although the complication rate was high, plate removal was uncommon. Patients were afforded good function and cosmesis. Severity of postoperative infection corresponded to a low preoperative absolute lymphocyte count, which suggests that increased preoperative diet supplementation may decrease the incidence of early infections. Improved mandibular function and esthetics may allow future patients to be offered early reconstruction routinely.\r"

  ".W": "Computed tomography (CT) was used postoperatively to assess the pterygomaxillary region in 12 orthognathic surgery patients who had had a Le Fort I osteotomy. Although pterygomaxillary separation was successful in all cases, in only 41.6% of the sides did fractures of the plate not occur. The incidence of low pterygoid plate fracture was 37.5% and that of high pterygoid plate fracture was 25%; 4.2% of sides showed a maxillary tuberosity fracture. Multiple fractures were observed in 8.3% of separated plates. Of 17 pterygoid plates judged clinically to be intact, only 10 were intact as assessed by CT. The significance of these findings and application of CT to evaluation of modifications to the Le Fort I osteotomy is discussed.\r"

Only one patient developed total necrosis of the flap; significant necrosis did not occur in any other patient. The anatomy of the flap and surgical technique are briefly presented.\r"

As the prestretch forces increased, the clinical strength of the wire diminished.\r"

  ".W": "The articular cartilage covering of the mandibular condyle and the articular eminence, as well as the tissue of the articular disc, may be affected by degenerative changes associated with osteoarthrosis. Degenerative changes of cartilage alter its physical properties and, as a result, affect its ability to withstand compressive and shearing stresses. Increased friction between the articular surfaces may impair joint movement and may elicit compensatory or pathologic responses of the cartilage and the adjacent tissues, such as capsule and ligaments, synovial membrane, subchondral bone, and associated musculature. In this review, these structural changes are described and related to common signs and symptoms of craniomandibular dysfunction, such as clicking, locking and instability, pain and tenderness, restricted ranges of mandibular motion, crepitation, deformity, muscle wasting, and changes of occlusion.\r"

The esthetic and anatomic basis, the surgical technique, and possible complications are discussed and two representative cases are shown. This technique has been used to treat 38 patients with various degrees of combined maxillary-zygomatic deficiency in the last 3 years. Based on this experience, it is concluded that this procedure provides a predictable esthetic result and excellent skeletal stability with few intraoperative and postoperative complications. Furthermore, the need for simultaneous bone grafting or alloplastic implants, as in the conventional Le Fort I, is virtually eliminated using this osteotomy.\r"

  ".W": "To compare two different mandibular reconstruction systems, a 5-cm angular resection was performed in nine adult sheep. The defect was reconstructed using either a classic AO plate or the AO-THORP reconstruction system. The animals were killed 5, 9, and 14 weeks after operation. Serial sections with the plates and screws in place were prepared and studied histologically and with microradiography and fluorescence microscopy. Twenty-six percent of the 2.7-mm AO cortical screws were adequately fixed. The corresponding percentage for AO-THORP hollow screws was 73%. The main advantage of the latter system is the screw-plate locking principle, which allows plate stability to be maintained even if bone is resorbed under the plate. Whether the existence of a screw lumen is an advantage has not yet been established.\r"
