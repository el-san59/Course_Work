These criteria should be considered to be contraindications to lumbar puncture.\r"

Multivariate analysis using the technique of logistic regression identified three variables, the Glasgow Coma Scale score, haemorrhage size and intraventricular extension of blood, which were most predictive of outcome. A model was developed from this analysis which accurately estimates the probability of good outcome and the risk of poor outcome based on data available on presentation. With additional validation, this model may be useful in choosing patients for surgical evacuation of haematomas.\r"

Its localization in the neoplasms was compared with that of fibronectin and glioma-mesenchymal extracellular matrix (GMEM) glycoprotein. In normal non-neural tissues type VI collagen was demonstrated in the interstitial connective tissue and in some basement membranes. In normal brain it was localized to the vasculature, leptomeninges, and pial-glial membrane. In neoplasms type VI collagen and fibronectin codistributed in the vasculature and stromal connective tissue. The GMEM glycoprotein, as identified by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 81C6, and a related glioma-mesenchymal matrix antigen identified by MAb 2A6, were expressed not only in the tumor vasculature and connective tissue, but also within the tumor parenchyma in association with glioma cells. The staining intensity was variable in 20 malignant gliomas and weak to absent in two pilocytic astrocytomas and six medulloblastomas. An oligodendroglioma and ependymoma both expressed the 2A6 epitope, but staining with MAb 81C6 was weak to absent. The antigens identified by MAb 81C6 and MAb 2A6 represent the only recognized extracellular matrix components, other than proteoglycans, that are associated with glioma cells in vivo. As prominent constituents of the pericellular matrix, they may be involved in recognized matrix functions such as the modulation of cell adhesion and migration.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if the amount of apo E released by rat peripheral nerve is increased following selective demyelination, in the absence of significant axonopathy. Using an immunoturbidimetric assay, release of apo E from excised sciatic nerve segments was measured during the phases of acute demyelination and remyelination caused by tellurium (Te) toxicity, during segmental demyelination in chronic lead (Pb) poisoning, and during Wallerian degeneration following nerve crush. Morphologic changes were examined in contralateral sciatic nerves by nerve-fiber teasing or by light and electron microscopy of transverse sections. As in previous studies, the amount of apo E released from the nerves was greatly increased following Wallerian degeneration due to nerve crush. In Te neuropathy, increased release of apo E was first detected on the fourth day of Te exposure, corresponding temporally to the acute onset of paralysis and segmental demyelination. Apolipoprotein E release rose steeply to a maximum of ten times the control values by day 9 and then gradually waned during the next five weeks, corresponding to a period of active remyelination and resolution of the neuropathy. In the demyelinating neuropathy of chronic lead poisoning, apo E release was increased four times over control animals after seven weeks of exposure, with less than 10% of teased fibers showing early paranodal demyelination and no evidence of remyelination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thus, a selective disruption of oligodendroglial function appears to occur. In order to investigate the in vitro cell tropism of BD virus, primary cultures derived from fetal and adult ovine CNS and peripheral nervous system were inoculated with BD virus. Infected cell types were determined by dual immunofluorescent labeling for viral and cell type specific antigens. Infection of all the major cell types represented in these cultures, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, fibroblasts, dorsal root ganglion neurons and Schwann cells was found. Oligodendrocytes were only infected earlier and appeared to remain infected longer than astrocytes and fibroblasts. Infectious virus was produced by all cultures and continued to be produced even after the disappearance of nearly all immunocytochemically detectable viral antigen within cells. These studies suggest that the selective dysfunction of the oligodendrocyte in BD is not based on a selective viral tropism.\r"

After one week, axons, dendrites, growth cone-like structures, synapses, and processes from astrocytes and microglia were present deep within the interstices of the implant. Morphometric analysis of synapses within the implant, support the qualitative impression of active neuronal ingrowth and de novo synaptogenesis by these sprouted elements. Astrocytic processes appear to comprise the major barrier to neuronal invasion of the implant. Several observations suggested that glia sometimes may facilitate neuronal ingrowth. These findings provide direct morphological documentation of axonal and dendritic plasticity in the mature rat neocortex. The work demonstrates a strategy that could be useful for further evaluating the cellular mechanism of in vivo neuronal regeneration.\r"

The inhibition of these processes with x-irradiation or parenteral corticosteroid administration was used to evaluate their contribution to the resolution of edema around a cortical freeze lesion in mice. The resorption of Evans blue, a marker of protein extravasation, was delayed in x-irradiated mice on the second day following a freeze lesion (p = 0.0075), which correlates with a delay in macrophage infiltration around the lesion. The specific gravity of the lesion and its border regions was significantly less in x-irradiated animals on day 7 than in controls (p = 0.00062), which correlates with a delay in new vessel formation around the lesion. Administration of corticosteroids from the time of production of the freeze lesion resulted in a specific gravity significantly less than control when measured eight days after the lesion (p = 0.01). Macrophages may participate by inhibiting the development of the macromolecular portion of vasogenic edema. The development of neovascularity correlates with the resorption of the aqueous portion of vasogenic edema. As with x-irradiation, corticosteroids administered from the time of freeze lesion inhibited the resorption of the aqueous portion of vasogenic edema, but they may suppress the spread of edema in this experimental model.\r"

Comparison of cell sizes found in the anatomic region of Clarke's column at two or three wk postoperatively with the cells found at 15 wk after transection and their respective control groups, shows a decrease in total cells found in operated rats 15 wk postoperative with a profound decrease in larger neurons in these rats. We did not detect a significant offsetting increase in smaller neurons. We believe the observed changes are due to death of large neurons and can find no evidence to support the contention that axotomized cells persist in a shrunken, atrophic state.\r"

In all patients, the results of the tests performed, including evoked potentials, CT scanning, oligoclonal bands in the CSF and myelography, were normal or inconclusive and did not lead to the correct diagnosis of the aetiology. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided the diagnosis of the causative process: multiple sclerosis in four cases, meningioma of the craniocervical junction or upper thoracic spinal cord in two cases, and upper cervical cord low-grade astrocytoma in one case. The patients with tumour could be treated effectively. Without MRI, however, the correct diagnosis would have been delayed. T2-weighted spin-echo scans provided maximal sensitivity for the detection of MS plaques, although they lacked specificity for a special disease. Several morphological criteria during MRI were helpful in differentiating Binswanger's disease, leucodystrophy and adrenoleucodystrophy from MS. It is concluded that at present MRI is the only non-invasive test with which to screen reliably the craniocervical junction and the upper cervical level, both of which are diagnostically difficult regions. The case histories also demonstrate that MRI is essential in all patients where a full clinical evaluation of the suspected spinal segment is not possible. \"Pure spinal MS\" is a misleading diagnosis and should not be accepted without confirmation by MRI. MRI has to be performed early enough to permit timely treatment of spinal and brain-stem disorders.\r"

  ".U": "88010094\r", 
  ".W": "Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were studied in a patient before and after the development of a cervico-medullary lesion. The first examination demonstrated normal subcortical generated potentials N13 and N14. The second examination, following a subarachnoid haemorrhage at the cervico-medullary junction, displayed a delayed and reduced amplitude P14/N14 peak on both sides. P14/N14 showed the same latency in all montages, using non-cephalic, cephalic and anterior neck references. The N13 component was not significantly changed in latency compared with the first examination. The latencies of the N13 peak were variable in the different montages. They increased from the lower (C7) to the upper (C2) neck, whereas the latency of the N13 onset was identical in all montages. This alteration might be caused by a delayed near-field activity at C2 overlapping the N13 component. These results fit the hypothesis of two major generators responsible for subcortical SEPs; a near-field N13 component at the level of the lower neck and a far-field P14 component arising from the level of the cervico-medullary junction. An additional minor near-field activity generated by the cuneate nucleus is suspected.\r"

Muscle biopsy showed some small angular fibres and scattered type 2B fibres with prominent tubular aggregates originating from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since the muscle fibres contracted at a lower concentration of caffeine, increased muscle fibre sensitivity to caffeine is probably related to muscle cramps in this disorder. Tubular aggregates are then secondarily formed in the muscle fibres.\r"

The authors suggested that the benign course might be related to the growth hormone deficiency and dwarfism. Other authors later supported this idea, having observed that in dystrophic mice and hamsters with congenital and experimentally induced pituitary dwarfism, respectively, pathological expressions of the dystrophy were markedly reduced. In this paper one case of Becker and one of limb-girdle dystrophy, each associated with short stature and growth hormone deficiency are described. In these cases the disease did not have a particularly benign course. It is concluded that caution is necessary, at least in certain cases, before an association between reduced muscular growth and the dystrophic process can be assumed.\r"

After stratification for disease-free interval and dominant sites of disease, patients were randomized to either CMF (cyclophosphamide [CYC], 100 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14; methotrexate [MTX], 40 mg intravenously [IV], days 1 and 8; 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], 500 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), or CAF (CYC, 100 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14; doxorubicin [DOX], 25 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8; 5-FU, 500 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), or CAFVP (CAF as above plus vincristine [VCR], 1.0 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8; and prednisone [PRED], 40 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14). Nonspecific immunotherapy with MER was administered in five sites at 100 micrograms or at the lowest tenfold dilution that produced a 1-cm indurated lesion. A total of 432 patients were entered, but 37 were disqualified, leaving 395 evaluable for treatment results and toxicities. One hundred thirty-five evaluable patients were randomized to chemoimmunotherapy until October 28, 1978. One hundred twenty-six evaluable patients were randomized to chemotherapy alone in the same time period. For the entire study, a total of 260 evaluable patients were randomized to chemotherapy. Chemoimmunotherapy patients were compared with the initial 126 chemotherapy patients. Chemotherapy regimens were compared among all 260 patients. Patient characteristics were similar between regimens and between chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy treatment groups. For patients on chemotherapy plus MER, there was no significant differences between the regimens for response frequencies: 43%, 41%, and 32%, respectively for CMF, CAF, and CAFVP. The comparable chemotherapy alone group had 36%, 58%, and 63% response, respectively. The response rates, adjusted for chemotherapy regimen, were 52% and 38% (P = .02) for chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy, respectively. MER was associated with painful ulcers and fevers. Thus, MER produced toxicity without response or survival benefit and further randomization after October 28, 1978 was to chemotherapy alone. For 260 evaluable patients on chemotherapy alone, the complete (CR) and partial responses (PR) were 37%, 55%, and 58%, respectively for CMF, CAF, and CAFVP. These response rates for CAF and CAFVP were significantly better than CMF (P = .01 and P less than .01, respectively). These comparisons were consistent within subgroupings such as dominant sites of disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective, randomized trial Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) evaluated CAF chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin + 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) v CAF plus tamoxifen (TCAF) in advanced breast cancer. Patients were stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status, dominant site of metastatic disease, menopausal status, and prior adjuvant therapy. Regardless of ER status or menopausal status, the addition of tamoxifen conferred no significant advantage in response rate, response duration, time to treatment failure (TTF) or survival over CAF alone. A secondary objective was to compare the response to CAF of ER positive (ER+) and ER negative (ER-) patients to determine if there was a differential response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Response rates of ER+ and ER- patients to CAF were identical (56%), but the response duration, time to treatment failure, and survival of ER+ patients were significantly longer than ER- patients. This lack of differential response implies that chemotherapy and hormonal therapy may compete for the same pool of ER+ cells. It also suggests that chemotherapy kills breast cancer cells indiscriminately, regardless of ER status.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the high response rates induced by chemotherapy, many patients with limited small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) relapse at the site of primary disease. Failure of radiotherapy to overcome this has led to the use of surgery as part of a combined modality approach. Between December 1981 and December 1985, 189 patients with SCLC were assessed for suitability for surgery after an initial three cycles of chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide). Fifty-seven were found to have limited disease, and of these, 19 were ineligible or unfit for surgery. Of the 38 eligible patients, 84% had an objective response to three cycles of chemotherapy and 25 were deemed suitable for surgery after restaging. At thoracotomy, four were inoperable, nine had a lobectomy, and 12 had a pneumonectomy. There was no evidence of viable SCLC in four resection specimens (one stage 1, two stage 2, one stage 3 at presentation), no viable SCLC but an entirely separate focus of viable poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma (SqLC) in one, and the remaining specimens contained viable SCLC. Survival of patients selected to undergo tumor resection was excellent (median survival, 33 months; plateau phase, 48% alive at 3 to 5 years), but survival of the entire group with limited SCLC was not dissimilar from that reported in previous series of limited-stage tumor treated with chemotherapy alone. Long-term survival appeared to be largely restricted to those with no evidence of viable SCLC at surgery (no viable SCLC, zero of five relapsed; viable SCLC, 13 of 16 relapsed and/or died). This prospective study confirms the feasibility of the combined modality approach, but suggests that any improvement in overall survival is likely to be small. Until the results from multicenter randomized trials are available, surgery, as part of a combined modality program, should be regarded as experimental.\r"

Tumor histologies were: 16 squamous cell, one mucoepidermoid, one adenocarcinoma, one neuroendocrine, four adenoid cystic, two acinic cell, one fibrosarcoma, and one melanoma. All primaries originated from tissues in the head and neck area. Nineteen patients had received prior treatment, including chemotherapy in 13; eight were newly diagnosed. Responses in 26 evaluable patients were two complete (CR), ten partial (PR), six minor (MR), and eight progressions. The median duration of response was 5 months, with a range of 2 to 11 months. Sites of progression were within the infused volume in 13 patients and to uninfused local-regional or distant sites in eight. The response rate in the subset of 15 patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer was 47%. Toxicity in the 26 patients included stomatitis in 88%, nausea and vomiting in 64%, myelosuppression in 15%, and grade 1 nephrotoxicity in 1%. A regional advantage for IA cisplatin and FUDR can be calculated based on total body clearance rates (CLTB) for these agents and estimates of external carotid artery (ECA) blood flow. However, frequent progression of disease outside the infused volume to regional and distant sites limits the usefulness of this approach in recurrent disease patients.\r"

In this study, regional abdominal HT was combined with intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin in canines to characterize temperature distributions, as well as pharmacokinetics and toxicity of IP cisplatin with and without HT. Cisplatin (65 mg/m2) in normal saline was administered IP with a two-hour dwell time in ten Beagle dogs. Five of the ten dogs were randomly selected to receive concurrent regional microwave-producing HT at approximately 41.5 degrees C (IP) for a 60-minute period. Systemic temperatures in heated animals ranged from 37 degrees C to 40 degrees C; IP temperatures ranged from 39 degrees C to 44 degrees C. Initial IP temperatures ranged from 39 degrees C to 44 degrees C. Initial IP cisplatin concentrations were ten to 22 times greater than serum levels; the IP drug half-lives were 133 +/- 9 minutes and 68 +/- 15 minutes in heated and unheated dogs, respectively (P less than .001). Total concentrations of serum and urine cisplatin did not differ between the heated and unheated controls. The area under the concentration v time curve for free, ultrafilterable cisplatin in serum in units of percent minutes was 40 +/- 8 in heated and 60 +/- 7 in unheated controls (P = .006). Except for transient nausea and vomiting, no evidence of serious toxicity was observed in serum chemistries or histopathologic sections at 21 days post-treatment. Experiments involving in vitro incubation of cisplatin in normal saline were performed as a function of saline temperature; these showed that the amount of reactive cisplatin metabolites formed increased linearly with temperature by approximately 30% from 38 degrees C to 44 degrees C. This study supports the hypothesis that, with IP temperature elevation, there is an increased rate of generation and retention of reactive metabolites of cisplatin in the peritoneal cavity relative to unheated controls. In spite of these differences in pharmacokinetics, no significant toxicity was encountered. This study provides a model for treatment of IP malignancy such as ovarian carcinoma with IP cisplatin and regional HT.\r"

The chemotherapy was administered as a 76-hour continuous infusion via a silastic central venous catheter and repeated every 28 days. The total response rate was 42% (25% complete and 17% partial). Median duration of response was 7 months. Areas of response were usually lung and lymph node metastases. Toxicity, mainly neutropenia, was acceptable. All patients relapsed. This combination chemotherapy results in a modest response rate for a malignancy about which there is little information regarding the treatment of disseminated disease. Future studies should determine the activity of this combination administered in a bolus fashion.\r"

Mean follow-up time was 76.6 months. Causes of death were compared with the expected risk, calculated from mortality statistics of the Netherlands' population. Sixty-seven patients died of progressive Hodgkin's disease, whereas 37 patients died of causes unrelated to advanced disease. Patients showed an increased risk of dying of leukemia and solid tumors (P less than .001), whereas the risk of dying of cardiovascular complications was not increased. The 10-year actuarial risk of dying of leukemia varied between 0% for patients treated with radiotherapy only and 5.7% for those needing salvage chemotherapy. The 10-year risk of dying of solid tumors was 0% for patients treated with chemotherapy and 6.5% for those receiving radiotherapy. Treatment-related fatalities were highest after combined modality therapy (P less than .025); the corresponding 10-year risk was 6.1%. Compared with younger ones, patients greater than or equal to 40 years had an increased risk of dying of causes unrelated to progressive Hodgkin's diseases. The actuarial risk of developing intercurrent fatalities at 10 years was 4.9% in patients less than 40 years, and 34.7% in those greater than or equal to 40 years (P less than .001). Compared with population based statistics, patients successfully treated for Hodgkin's disease still showed an increased risk of dying (P less than .001). Treatment modality, stage, and histologic subtype were not predictors of intercurrent death.\r"

The original Kiel classification consisting of low grade (LG) and high grade (HG) forms corresponded well to the LG and HG forms of the WF. When an expanded Kiel containing an intermediate grade (IG) composed of the original LG diffuse group was devised, this gave a much better separation of survival of the three grades as compared with the WF where the survival of IG and HG forms were nonsignificantly different. The main reason for this difference was the inclusion of the so-called centroblastic diffuse form in the HG Kiel, but in the IG according to the WF. In a \"modified\" WF analysis where this histologic entity was placed in the HG subgroup, the three survival curves then gave excellent separation like the expanded Kiel classification. Since the centroblastic diffuse form (and its analogous forms according to other classifications) has a poor prognosis, it is important that it be so recognized and treated accordingly with aggressive therapy. We propose either our expanded Kiel or modified WF classification of the three grade forms as an excellent predictor of survival.\r"

Parameters that may effect the type of treatment given during the initial episode of therapy in the center and the effect of these characteristics on survival were studied. In the univariate analysis, age, treatment, and distance traveled to the center were statistically associated with survival. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for potentially confounding covariates, blacks survive better than whites and the effects of sex and socioeconomic status (SES) on survival approach significance. Survival consistently improved with increasing distance traveled to treatment centers. This may be a serious confounding variable in assessing the results by both single and multiinstitution clinical trials.\r"

Rapid, anatomically accurate diagnosis is essential to the successful management of these patients. We compared spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conventional myelography in a series of 31 cancer patients being evaluated for myelopathy (N = 10), or back/radicular pain (N = 21). All patients were evaluated between April 1985 and July 1986, and underwent both studies within ten days of each other (median, two days). MRI was performed on a 0.5 Tesla Technicare unit with a body surface coil, and results compared with standard contrast myelography. All studies were reviewed separately and in a \"blinded\" fashion. MRI and myelography were comparable in detecting large lesions that produced complete subarachnoid block (five of ten patients with myelopathy, three of twenty-one patients with back/radicular pain). In 19 of 31 patients, smaller but clinically significant extradural lesions were found. In nine of 19 cases, these lesions were demonstrated equally well by both modalities; in nine of 19 cases, these lesions were demonstrated by myelography alone; in one of 19, a lesion was demonstrated by MRI alone. Given our current technology, myelography appeared superior to MRI as a single imaging modality. However, MRI may be an alternative in patients where total myelography is technically impossible or unusually hazardous.\r"

The areas from which a neoplasm could be removed by this approach included the sphenoid and clival bone; the medial half of the petrous temporal bone; the infratemporal fossa; the nasopharynx; the retro- and parapharyngeal area; the ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses; and the intradural clivus-foramen magnum area. The pathology of the neoplasms included benign tumors such as meningioma, malignant cartilaginous neoplasms such as chordoma, and other malignant lesions such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This approach offers many advantages over other anterior and lateral approaches to the lateral and posterior cranial base: these include minimal brain retraction; direct access to the ipsilateral petrous and upper cervical internal carotid artery; reconstruction of extensive cranial base defects, often with the use of a vascularized rectus abdominus flap; preservation of the hearing conduction mechanism when it is not involved by tumor; and the maintenance of excellent facial nerve function postoperatively. The use of an anterior extradural approach (transethmoidal) and of an intradural approach (frontotemporal or retromastoid), either concurrently or separately, is necessary in some patients to effect total tumor removal. The most serious complication in this series was the death of a patient due to postoperative infection and bilateral carotid artery rupture, which may have been avoided by the use of a rectus abdominis muscle flap for reconstruction. Among the 21 surviving patients, 18 had a good outcome, two had a fair outcome, and one with preexisting neurological deficits had a poor outcome. One of the surviving patients with a chordoma died of pulmonary metastases 1 year later, without evidence of local recurrence. The length of postoperative follow-up evaluation in these patients is insufficient to make any judgment about the effectiveness of this surgical approach in achieving a cure or long-term control of the tumors described.\r"

Twenty-two patients had high-grade gliomas (13 glioblastomas, six recurrent glioblastomas, two anaplastic astrocytomas, and one recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma) and one had a right frontal metastasis from a carcinoma of the lung. Hematoporphyrin derivative was administered to these patients in a dose of 5 mg/kg and, 24 hours later, they all underwent a craniotomy with radical excision of the tumor. The tumor bed was then irradiated with 630 nm of laser light from either an argon dye laser or a gold metal vapor laser for between 43 and 94 minutes, receiving total doses of 70 to 120 J/sq cm (six cases) or 120 to 230 J/sq cm (17 cases). The temperature of the tumor bed was kept below 37 degrees C by irrigation. Fifteen patients who developed new tumors underwent postoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy in 20 divided doses). There was no evidence of increased cerebral edema and no other toxicity from the therapy. All patients were discharged from the hospital within 18 days of surgery. Four of seven patients with gliomas have suffered a further recurrence at 12 to 16 weeks, and two of 15 patients with primarily treated gliomas experienced recurrence at 3 and 13 months following therapy. Fifteen patients have had no recurrence of their tumor and are alive and well at a median follow-up period of 7 months (range 1 to 16 months). It is concluded that photoradiation therapy using 5 mg/kg of hematoporphyrin derivative and 630 nm light at doses of up to 230 J/sq cm can be used as an adjuvant to surgery and radiotherapy with no additional complications.\r"

  ".W": "Only about 5% of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) are located predominantly within the ventricular system. Between July, 1981, and February, 1986, 15 patients were treated at the authors' institution for AVM's within the ventricular trigone. The mean age of this patient population was 24 years, and two-thirds were female. Intracranial hemorrhage was by far the most frequent presenting symptom and intraventricular hemorrhage occurred in 11 cases, with multiple episodes being documented in five. Arterial supply of the malformations was quite uniform, with the lateral posterior choroidal or posterior temporal branch of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) being the most frequent source. Venous drainage was similarly stereotypic, with predominant outflow into the galenic system in all but one patient. An interhemispheric surgical approach was used in eight patients, a middle or inferior temporal gyrus incision was performed in six, and a subtemporal route was chosen in a single patient. Operative results suggest that these lesions can be removed with reasonable safety. An interhemispheric approach is recommended if the nidus projects medially from the trigone and is observed medial to the P2-P3 junction of the PCA on angiography. A middle temporal gyrus approach is suggested if the nidus is lateral to the P2-P3 junction, even when the lesion is located in the dominant hemisphere. A subtemporal approach should be reserved for inferiorly projecting AVM's with cortical representation on the fusiform or parahippocampal gyrus in the nondominant hemisphere.\r"

Only three lesions had abnormal vasculature in the form of venous pooling or a capillary blush. The CT scans were positive in seven patients and detected 14 lesions, while high-field strength (1.5 Tesla) MRI was positive in each case and demonstrated 27 distinct lesions. On T2-weighted MRI, the combination of a reticulated core of mixed signal intensity (SI) with a surrounding rim of decreased SI strongly suggests the diagnosis of a cavernous malformation. Smaller lesions appear as areas of decreased SI (black dots). The sensitivity of MRI is based on magnetic susceptibility and possibly diffusion effects related to field heterogeneity that is more conspicuous on high-field imaging and caused by the presence of excessive iron (hemosiderin).\r"

After the Diamox injection, rCBF increased at all locations measured in all subjects. On average, rCBF increased 1.7 times. The following were found for rCBF in both resting and Diamox-treated subjects: 1) rCBF decreased significantly with increasing age; 2) slope and intercept for the regression of rCBF on age were largest for frontal detectors, intermediate for parietal detectors, and smallest for occipital detectors; 3) rCBF hyperfrontality was most noticeable in younger subjects; 4) in subjects of any age, 95% confidence intervals for rCBF were relatively large (expected value +/- 30%) and lower 95% confidence intervals for Diamox rCBF tended to overlap the upper 95% confidence intervals for resting rCBF; and 5) side-to-side percentage difference in rCBF did not have a significant regression on age and tended to be less than 10% to 20%. Diamox did not have an important effect on blood pressure, pulse rate, or respiratory rate. The normative data for the rCBF response to Diamox was used in evaluating 20 patients with cerebrovascular disease. Forty percent of these patients, all of whom exhibited angiographic evidence of potentially hemodynamically significant lesions, had normal rCBF at rest and after Diamox injection. Twenty percent had normal resting flows with abnormal Diamox-activated flows. Asymmetry in rCBF was the most sensitive indicator of a potential abnormality in cerebral perfusion. Thirty percent of the abnormal studies showed only significant asymmetry. It is suggested that rCBF studies at rest and after Diamox treatment, with age-related norms, may be useful in the management of patients with cerebrovascular disease.\r"

It is shown that on average the CSF formation rate tends to decrease with increasing ICP. It is also shown that the size of the ventricles increases as the ICP levels off toward normal values. The clinical implication of this is that a small or normal ventricular size in acute or subacute phases does not preclude defective CSF resorption.\r"

Because of the disturbing ranges in the incidence of stroke morbidity and mortality reported from the several institutional series studying carotid endarterectomy, the authors undertook a prospective review of 142 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed for symptomatic atherosclerotic occlusive vascular disease on the neurosurgical service. The University of Alabama Hospital. Preoperative risk assessment was performed in each case according to the Mayo Clinic classification system. The overall mortality rate was 1.4% and the major stroke morbidity rate was 0.7%, for a combined major morbidity and mortality rate of 2.1%. The incidence of minor neurological morbidity was 1.4%. There was no morbidity or mortality in the Grade I and II (low-risk) patient groups. This low combined major morbidity and mortality rate of 2.1% for carotid endarterectomy causes the surgical stroke-free survival curve to intersect the medical stroke-free survival curve at an earlier point in time, and thus demonstrates the greater reduction in risk of stroke which accrues over time for the surgically treated patient.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied a consecutive series of 75 patients with cerebellar hemorrhage diagnosed by computerized tomography (CT) scanning, and assessed the relationship of outcome to the CT appearance of the quadrigeminal cistern, which in some cases was obliterated by rostral displacement of the vermis resulting from the cerebellar mass. Obliteration of the quadrigeminal cisterns was classified on the CT scans into three grades: normal (Grade I), compressed (Grade II), or absent (Grade III). There were 43 patients with Grade I, 16 with Grade II, and 16 with Grade III cisterns. Of the 75 patients, 38 (88.4%) of those with Grade I, 11 (68.8%) of those with Grade II, and none of those with Grade III cisterns returned to their previous activities at 6 months or more after onset. A Grade I cistern predicted a good outcome whether the hematoma was evacuated or not, as long as obstructive hydrocephalus, if present, was relieved early. However, a Grade II cistern was not predictive of a good outcome unless the hematoma was evacuated within 48 hours after onset of the hemorrhage. A Grade III cistern invariably predicted an unfavorable outcome. It is concluded that the CT grade of quadrigeminal cistern obliteration is an accurate indicator of outcome and is highly useful in selecting appropriate treatment for patients with cerebellar hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of complete clot removal at times from 48 to 96 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on the development of chronic cerebral vasospasm was evaluated to determine whether there is a critical point after which clot removal is ineffective in preventing vasospasm. Thirty cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to one of five groups: sham-operated group, clot removal at 48 hours after SAH (48-hour group), clot removal at 72 hours after SAH (72-hour group), clot removal at 96 hours after SAH (96-hour group), and clot placement only (clot group). Standard microsurgical techniques were used to dissect bilaterally the major cerebral arteries free of arachnoid. An autologous blood clot averaging 4.2 gm was placed around the vessels in the subarachnoid space of the monkeys in the 48-hour, 72-hour, 96-hour, and clot groups. Physiological saline was instilled into the subarachnoid space of the sham-operated animals. Animals in the clot-removal groups underwent surgical clot removal at the determined times for each group. Two animals in each of the sham-operated and clot groups were subjected to reoperation at each of 48, 72, and 96 hours after SAH. The incisions were reopened and then simply reclosed. Neurological status, angiographic cerebral vessel caliber, and physiological status were evaluated before and 7 days after SAH induction. There were no significant neurological deficits in the sham-operated, 48-hour, or 72-hour groups. Two animals in each of the 96-hour and clot groups showed deterioration in level of consciousness developing on Day 4 or 5 after SAH induction. All the major cerebral arteries of the animals in the clot and 96-hour groups showed significant vasospasm (p less than 0.01) on Day 7. Animals in the 72-hour group had significant vasospasm (p less than 0.05) of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries but not the anterior cerebral arteries. There was no significant vasospasm (p greater than 0.05) in any of the cerebral arteries in the 48-hour group. Severity of vasospasm paralleled the duration of contact between the blood clot and the cerebral vessels. Evacuation of the subarachnoid hematoma later than 48 hours after SAH resulted in no significant reduction in the degree of chronic cerebral vasospasm. It is suggested that clot removal at early operation is likely to be useful only if it is performed within 48 hours of SAH.\r"

This question was studied in 32 anesthetized cats, 16 of which underwent a standard craniectomy (2.5 X 2.0 cm) in the left frontoparietal region. Brain tissue pressure, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and brain water content were measured from the same area of cortical gray and white matter, and intracranial pressure (ICP) was recorded from the cisterna magna. Brain tissue resistance, tissue compliance, and the pressure-volume index were analyzed in response to a bolus injection of saline into brain tissue or the cisterna magna. Cerebrovascular resistance was also calculated. In craniectomized animals 2 hours after surgery, ICP had fallen to 3.75 +/- 0.39 mm Hg, and cortical gray and white matter tissue pressure had fallen to 3.19 +/- 0.47 and 4.69 +/- 0.54 mm Hg, respectively (mean +/- standard error of the mean); these variables did not fall further over 4 hours. The pressure-volume index in the same animals increased significantly from 0.67 +/- 0.01 to 0.86 +/- 0.04 ml. Tissue compliance rose in the cortical gray matter but tissue resistance fell, approximating that found in subjacent white matter. There was no significant difference between animals with and without craniectomy in rCBF, cerebrovascular resistance, or brain water content in either gray or white matter. These findings indicate that in the cat craniectomy causes an increase in the compensatory capacity of the intracranial cavity to increased volume. The data also indicate that cortical tissue has high hydraulic conductivity and compliance when the skull is opened.\r"

An intraluminal intervascular splint made of water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol, which dissolved and disappeared within a few minutes after recirculation of blood, was used for precise \"intima-to-intima\" coaptation. No stay sutures or glue were required during the procedure. There was a 92% patency rate 24 hours after surgery, and the anastomosed vessels were still patent on the 7th and 30th postoperative days. Complications such as aneurysm formation or stenotic change were negligible. The fusion of the muscle layer and collagen fibers of the media in the anastomosis was confirmed histologically. A tensile strength test immediately following operation and 1 week later showed that this anastomosis was significantly better than that achieved with the usual manual suture method. The major advantages of this technique, combined with use of a water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol splint, are rapidity, consistency of results, and firm fusion with no residual foreign body.\r"

New unused materials were also examined for comparison. Surface changes in six systems could be observed under an operating microscope. Substantial quantities of a white deposit had adhered to the tubing in four of the shunts. These changes were most advanced in the galeal penetrative portion of the shunts and are believed to have been caused by mechanical stress. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed surface wrinkles, microscopic holes, and tiny particles, suggesting deterioration of the material itself. An energy-dispersive analysis using x-rays demonstrated that the surface deposits were due to mineralization of calcium phosphate and that the tiny particle growth was aluminum. These changes may be a consequence of the degradation of silicone rubber. A discriminant analysis of the mineralization was carried out; thus, the age of the host and the duration of system implantation could be correlated with the incidence of mineralization (p less than 0.1). A measurement of the physical properties showed progressive change with a remarkable deterioration in systems implanted for more than 5 years.\r"

Normal lung/heart ratio values were defined using an additional 45 subjects with less than 1% probability of coronary artery disease. The number of diseased vessels was the best discriminator between patients with increased ratios versus those with normal ratios. Double product at peak exercise, number of segments with abnormal wall motion, patient gender, and duration of exercise were also significant discriminators. Using discriminant function analysis these variables could correctly identify 81% of cases with increased lung/heart ratios and 72% of cases with normal ratios. These results indicate that an increased lung/heart ratio of thallium reflects exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction and affords a better understanding of why this thallium parameter is a powerful prognostic indicator in patients with chest pain.\r"

We documented through review of cines, computer analysis of gated cardiac blood-pool scintigraphy data, and correlation with echocardiograms that this phenomenon was artifact introduced by rotational movements of the heart. It is important for nuclear physicians to recognize this rotational artifact on the phase analysis image in order to avoid the erroneous misdiagnosis of wall motion abnormalities of the septum.\r"

  ".W": "The utility of radiophosphate bone scanning in the detection of complications following total knee replacement (TKR) is not yet fully established. A difficulty associated with the use of bone scanning is the persistent increased uptake seen around the prosthetic joint long after surgery, despite the absence of symptoms. In order to better characterize the time course of radiophosphate uptake, bone scans obtained 1 mo-12 yr after surgery were analyzed in 30 asymptomatic patients with 37 TKR. Uptake was graded 0-4+ in the femoral and tibial components. Scans of 18 implants were obtained 1 yr or less after surgery (Group 1), and 19 were obtained greater than 1 yr after surgery (Group 2). Mean uptake scores were as follows: femoral component Group 1 = 3.0 +/- 1.1; Group 2 = 1.8 +/- 0.9 (p less than 0.05); tibial component Group 1 = 3.2 +/- 0.8; Group 2 = 2.6 +/- 1.1 (not significant). Persistent increased uptake, particularly in the tibial component, reflects mechanical stresses peculiar to knee prostheses, and tends to undermine confidence in diagnosing loosening on the basis of a single study.\r"

The bowel uptake was present in all 33 patients ingesting food between 15 min and 3.5 hr before scanning. In those patients who had not eaten within 4 hr of the study, only 25% demonstrated bowel activity. The observation of bowel uptake is important in differentiating a physiologic phenomenon from pathologic accumulations of activity. Pathology should be ruled out when bowel activity is not located in the usual left flank and lower mid-abdomen, or is present in a fasting individual.\r"

This is the first 191Os/191mIr generator that combines the advantages of high 191mIr yield, extremely low 191Os breakthrough, and an eluate that does not require buffering prior to injection. These improvements in performance were accomplished through use of the chelate transdioxobisoxalatoosmate(VI) as the parent complex on the generator. The clinical result of the combination of higher yield and lower breakthrough is a 100-fold decrease in the estimated patient radiation dose compared with the same study performed with technetium-99m (99mTc), and the injectable eluate makes the generator easier to use. Acute and subacute toxicity studies performed on this generator eluate have shown no adverse effects attributable to the eluate.\r"

Uptake in NB was shown to be specific for MoAb 3F8 when contrasted with pooled mouse IgG or irrelevant IgG3 MoAb controls. Both small (50 mg) and large tumors greater than 2 g) showed radiolocalization. The percent injected dose uptake per gram tumor ranged from 8 to 50% and was inversely correlated with tumor size. Optimal tumor to normal tissue ratios were reached by 24-48 hr. There was no abnormal uptake in the reticuloendothelial system and the MoAb did not cross the blood-brain barrier. Based on the kinetics of the amount of radioactivity deposited in tissues, the relative radiation dose to normal organs was estimated to be 1% to 20% of the tumor dose. The MoAb 3F8 is useful for targeting radioactivity to human NB in vivo and the nude mice xenograft model may allow optimization of parameters that influence such biodistribution.\r"

Experiments in rats were carried out to determine how closely the movements of [125I]MIBG in the heart mimicked those of [3H]NE, and if the changes [125I] MIBG concentrations would reflect injury to, and function of, adrenergic neurons in the heart. Injury to adrenergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine substantially reduced the uptake of [125I] MIBG into the left ventricle, but the effect was less than that on uptake of [3H]NE uptake and concentration of endogenous NE. Similarly, when desmethylimipramine was given to inhibit the uptake-1 pathway of neurons, the reduction in uptake of [125I]MIBG was statistically significant but less than that of [3H]NE; part of this difference may be attributable to partial uptake of [125I]MIBG into neurons by a diffusion pathway. Substantial fractions of [125I]MIBG and [3H]NE were displaced from the heart by the sympathomimetic drug, phenylpropanolamine. When adrenergic neurons of the heart were stimulated by feeding of rats, the disappearance rates of [3H]NE and [125I]MIBG from the heart were significantly increased. Although not a perfect analog of [3H]NE, [125I]MIBG appears to enter and leave the heart in patterns similar to those of [3H]NE. Thus, movements of [125I]MIBG give indices of adrenergic neuron injury and function in the heart.\r"

Movements of [123I]MIBG into and out of organs were measured by quantitative scintigraphy in man. We perturbed adrenergic neuron function in several ways, and [123I]MIBG concentrations in the heart were subsequently altered in patterns consistent with the concept that [123I]MIBG resides mostly in adrenergic neurons. Uptake of [123I]MIBG into the heart was inhibited by the tricyclic drug, imipramine, and this agent also accelerated the rate of loss of [123I]MIBG. Phenylpropanolamine, a sympathomimetic drug that acts by displacing norepinephrine from neurons, increased the rates of loss of [123I]MIBG from the heart. Exercise was followed by a movement of [123I]MIBG into blood and urine. Generalized autonomic neuropathies were associated with marked diminutions of [123I]MIBG uptake into the heart. We conclude that quantitative scintigraphy in patients will enable determinations of regional disturbances in integrity (by measuring uptake of [123I]MIBG) and function (by measuring rates of loss of [123I]MIBG) of the adrenergic nervous system in the heart.\r"

First, since UR departments are seldom part of the nursing department, UR nurses are practicing outside the realm of nursing. What responsibility, if any, does the nursing department have to nurses practicing in the hospital, yet not in the nursing department? What can the nursing department do to help UR nurses maintain their identification with the profession and appreciate the strategic importance of their role, with its legal and financial ramifications? Second, UR is changing the established role of the primary care nurse. In your institution UR may already have taken the staff nurses' discharge planning function. It appears that several factors are contributing to this role change. Patient acuity has increased the time needed to administer physical care. The nursing shortage means more patients are assigned to each professional nurse and paraprofessionals are doing more patient care. There is less and less time left for the primary nurse to practice the professional attributes of nursing, primarily discharge planning. This function is shifting to the UR Department. Is discharge planning a function nurse executives wish to relinquish? Finally, we are entering another period of severe nurse shortages, where recruitment and retention of staff are paramount. Actively competing for our staff are the UR departments. Forty professional nurses work in three regional centers of the American Health Network, American Group Insurance Company (Dallas, Texas). In one hospital of 450 beds, nine nurses are employed by the UR department.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "ADP-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin-induced thromboxane B2 generation in diluted whole blood from rats fed a fat-free diet supplemented with 10% (by weight) hydrogenated coconut oil [essential fatty acid (EFA) deficient] were significantly lower than that in animals fed 10% safflower oil [(SFO) rich in linoleic acid] or 10% marine oil (rich in eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid). Plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly lower and liver function was impaired in the EFA-deficient group compared with the other two groups. Platelet responsiveness to ADP was restored when plasma from the EFA-deficient rats was replaced by plasma obtained from rats fed a nonpurified diet. ADP responsiveness and thrombin-stimulated thromboxane B2 production in diluted whole blood were also restored after 2 wk of injections of 100 mg ethyl linoleate every 48 h, and partially restored by injections of 100 mg ethyl alpha-linolenate. When ADP-induced platelet aggregation was examined in washed platelets, the impaired ADP aggregation (found when platelets of the EFA-deficient rats were suspended in their own plasma) was not observed at either high (9.5 microM) or low (1.0 microM) ADP concentrations. Although thrombin-stimulated thromboxane B2 production in washed platelets in the EFA-deficient rats was lower than that in the SFO-fed rats, the magnitude of aggregation was not different. In addition, inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by apyrase (0.06 U/mL) was identical in the two groups. These results suggest that impaired platelet aggregation in EFA deficiency is related more to plasma factors than to inherent platelet properties and that restoration of normal liver function is associated with normal platelet function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of enterohepatic circulation of cholesterol and bile acids in the hypocholesterolemic activity of soybean protein isolate (SPI) was compared with the activity of casein. Intact, sham-operated, jejunectomized or ileectomized adult rats were fed a cholesterol-free, purified diet containing either 20% casein or 20% SPI for 7 or 10 d. For the subsequent 7 d the diets were reversed. In intact rats the plasma cholesterol concentration (p-chol) was significantly higher when the casein diet was fed than when the SPI diet was fed. Within 3 d after the diet crossover, p-chol in each group of intact rats reached rapidly the same level as that in its previous counterpart. These rapid inherent responses of p-chol to the casein and SPI diets remained unchanged even when the jejunum or the ileum was resected, and p-chol in jejunectomized or ileectomized rats was similar to that found in sham-operated rats. The extent of the change in p-chol induced by exchanging dietary proteins was almost the same among intact, sham-operated, jejunectomized and ileectomized rats. These findings indicate that the interruption of enterohepatic circulation of cholesterol and bile acids is not the major factor involved in the differential effects of dietary proteins on p-chol.\r"

  ".W": "Protein-deficient diets (17, 10, 6.5 or 3% protein) and a 24% control diet were fed to growing chicks. A control group was pair-fed daily with each deficient group. Energy intake was lower in the 6.5 and 3% protein groups than in the other groups. However, weight gain, bone growth and feed conversion efficiency were lower with 10% protein or less. Relative thyroid weights were unaffected by dietary protein. Plasma T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) levels were significantly higher in all deficient groups, whereas plasma T4 (thyroxine) was lower. Plasma rT3 (reverse T3) was unaffected by the protein deficiencies, suggesting that enhanced conversion of T4 to T3 rather than to rT3 had occurred. Hepatic alpha-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GP) shuttle activity increased markedly in protein-deficient chicks. Efficiency of energy utilization was unaltered in chicks fed 17 or 10% protein but was higher in chicks fed 6.5 and 3% protein than in controls. All deficient chicks had more fat and less protein and water in the tissues. The lower feed conversion efficiency therefore represents almost entirely a shift in body composition toward fat and does not reflect a loss of energy as heat. We conclude that elevations in plasma T3 and in thyroid-controlled alpha-GP shuttle activity, although sensitive indicators of protein deficiencies, are not good predictors of altered thermogenic activity in protein-deficient chicks.\r"

The optimal concentration for growth with L-methionine ranges from 0.02 to 1.0 mM, whereas that for DL-MHA is 7.5 mM. At concentrations above 1.0 mM, L-methionine exhibits a toxic effect. Supplementing 1.0 mM L-methionine with DL-MHA allows greater growth than that provided by an equimolar concentration of L-methionine alone, and no toxic effect is seen at methionine source (DL-MHA) concentrations up to 7.5 mM. Early in the growth phase of cells where DL-MHA is the sole source of methionine, a 48-h lag period is observed over that seen in cells grown in the presence of 1.0 mM L-methionine. After the lag period, the MHA-supplemented cells double at the same rate as the methionine-supplemented cells. Studies with the purified isomers of D- and L-MHA indicate that only the D-isomer is utilized by these fibroblasts.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this work was to examine whether the nature of fiber may influence the cecal digestion in the rat fed hydrocolloids such as gums. Adaptation to a high fiber diet containing 15% guar gum (GG) or gum arabic (GA) was thus studied in rats previously adapted to a high starch fiber-free diet. Both gums elicited a marked enlargement of the cecum and a trophic effect on the cecal wall. The cecal pH dropped to 5.8, then plateaued to about 6.1. During the first days of adaptation, a part of GA escaped microbial degradation; thereafter the cecal pool of volatile fatty acids (VFA) was similar with both diets (approximately equal to 1000 mumol). GA promoted propionate-rich fermentations, whereas GG rather enhanced acetic and butyric fermentations. VFA absorption was higher with the gum diets than with the control diet, because blood flow increased in parallel to the weight of cecal wall. K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were absorbed in large amounts from the cecum, particularly in rats fed the GA diet. With this diet, high concentrations of nonsoluble Ca2+ and phosphate (but low concentrations of soluble phosphate) were found in the cecum. The study indicates that gums have potent effects on digestion in the large bowel, and that there are specific effects of the different types of gums.\r"

After 1, 2 and 3 d of an oral dose of 20 mg of alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol or both, the levels of the two vitamers were measured in plasma and tissues and in some cases in isolated microsomal and mitochondrial fractions from liver. Twenty-four hours after an oral dose of 20 mg gamma-tocopherol the levels of alpha-tocopherol in plasma and tissues remained constant and higher levels of gamma-tocopherol were found in tissues in which low alpha-tocopherol levels could be found such as in the LE group. In spite of this, it was enabled to remain there, after 2 and 3 d gamma-tocopherol had decreased levels in all tissues. When given in combination with alpha-tocopherol, the levels of gamma-tocopherol were lower than when gamma-tocopherol was given alone. Microsomes and mitochondria from livers of LE group bound five and nine times more alpha-tocopherol than gamma-tocopherol in rats dosed with equal amount of alpha- or gamma-tocopherol, respectively. These data indicate that the mechanisms that regulate the metabolism of vitamin E are highly specific for alpha-tocopherol. Moreover, the relative amount of alpha-tocopherol determined the levels of gamma-tocopherol in tissues. However, the retention of gamma-tocopherol in tissues did not depend on the presence of alpha-tocopherol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a single injection of ACTH (3 IU/100 g body weight) on the distribution of ascorbic acid (AA) and radiolabeled AA in 20 tissues was studied in adult male guinea pigs consuming 500 mg AA/kg diet. Saline- or ACTH-injected animals were simultaneously injected with [1-14C]AA, and killed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after injection. There was no significant difference between treatments in the weight of any tissue over the 6-h experimental period. As anticipated, the concentration of AA in the adrenals of animals injected with ACTH was 33% of that of animals injected with saline at 4 h. Unexpectedly, the concentration of radiolabeled AA in the adrenals at 0.5 h after ACTH injection was 172% of that after saline injection. The concentration of radiolabeled AA in the adrenal of the saline-injected animals increased slowly over time to reach a level similar to that of ACTH-injected animals by 6 h. There was no effect of ACTH on the level of AA or uptake in any of the other tissues examined. These results demonstrate that a single dose of ACTH markedly influences the retention of AA in the adrenal gland without similarly altering retention of AA in other tissues. Furthermore, ACTH treatment causes both accelerated uptake and release of AA into the adrenals.\r"

This drug has a structure that suggests that it could act as a chelating agent. To examine its effects on trace metal and mineral metabolism, 38 weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of five treatment groups. These were a high dose [(HD) 1750 mg/(kg X d)] group, HD pair-fed control (HDPF) group, intermediate dose [(ID) 875 mg/(kg X d)] group, ID pair-fed (IDPF) group and low dose [(LD) 87.5 mg/kg X d)] group. In a separate experiment, 20 female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of two treatment groups: a high dose cimetidine group [(HDFem) 1750 mg/kg X d)] and a pair-fed control group (PFFem). Cimetidine was administered intragastrically four times per week for 5 wk. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) found among groups for the male rats studied included higher plasma copper in the HD and the ID groups, higher plasma sodium, liver copper, heart calcium and heart zinc in the HD group and a lower percentage of fecal excretion of all the divalent metals studied in the HD and the ID groups than in their pair-fed controls. Pathologic examination of the liver revealed extensive fatty infiltration of liver cells, liver cell necrosis and disrupture of liver lobular architecture in the HD group. Cimetidine-dosed females had higher zinc in heart and plasma, higher copper in heart, kidney, liver, jejunum, ileum and uterus, higher manganese in stomach and ileum, lower iron in kidney and liver, lower kidney calcium and higher stomach calcium and lower liver magnesium compared with their pair-fed controls. Levels of liver and kidney metallothionein in the two groups were comparable. Male and female rats receiving high dose cimetidine experienced significant changes in tissue concentrations of some of the trace metals and minerals studied.\r"

After 1, 2 and 3 wk of lactation, litters from each group were killed and tissues analyzed for MT-I. The relatively mild degree of zinc deficiency, which had no effect on fetal viability or litter size and caused only slightly lower pup weight, caused significantly lower MT-I concentrations in pup liver, thymus, plasma and red cells, particularly in pups from dams receiving 6 mg zinc/kg. Maternal zinc supply is therefore a major determinant of MT-I concentrations in neonatal tissues, and assay of this protein in blood plasma and red cells may give a useful indication of zinc status.\r"

  ".W": "Using an animal model involving rats fed tetraethylorthosilicate, the minimal effective dietary concentration of ammonium chloride for reduction of silica urolithiasis was determined to be approximately 0.10 equivalents/kg diet. Ammonium sulfate appeared to be only slightly less effective. The lower incidences of urolithiasis were associated with urinary pH less than 7. A subprophylactic concentration (0.067 equivalents/kg diet) of ammonium chloride was factored with three levels of supplemental phosphorus (0, 0.15 and 0.30%) from Na2HPO4 to determine whether the antiurolithic effects of dietary phosphate and urinary-acidifying salts are synergistic. Phosphate had no effect on urinary pH. A 50% urolith incidence occurred in controls; the incidence was 25% (P = 0.08) with 0.15 and 10% (P less than 0.01) with 0.30% phosphorus. Urinary pH was 7.5 in controls compared with approximately 7.2 in rats given the subprophylactic level of ammonium chloride, but ammonium chloride alone had no effect on urolithiasis. However, complete protection from urolithiasis was provided by each of the two levels of phosphorus in combination with ammonium chloride. It is concluded that supplemental dietary phosphorus is most effective for protection against silica urolithiasis under conditions contributing toward urinary acidification due to a possible synergism between dietary phosphorus and urinary acidifying salts.\r"

Urine was collected and characterized for total radioactivity as well as for radiolabeled trimethylselenonium (TMSe). At lower doses of selenite (up to 500 micrograms/kg body wt), 30% of the administered dose was excreted. At higher doses of selenite, fractional urine excretion decreased as a function of the dose. The observed decrease in fractional urine excretion was not caused by changes in the absorption of the administered radiolabel. There was a direct relationship between the amount of the administered dose of selenite (up to 1500 micrograms/kg body wt) and the proportion of urinary [75Se] excreted as TMSe. Pretreatment with seleno compounds (10 or 100 micrograms Se/kg body wt as selenite, or selenomethionine) for 35 d before a challenge dose of [75Se]selenite did not influence the excretion of total [75Se] or of [75Se]TMSe in urine. Ingestion of a choline-deficient diet, which should deplete the availability of methyl groups, did not have any effect on excretion of total [75Se] or of [75Se]TMSe in urine after a challenge dose of [75Se]selenite (500 micrograms/kg body wt). The data presented here permit the following conclusions: 1) Production of TMSe is dose dependent, 2) production of TMSe from a single acute dose does not depend on the history of selenium intake and 3) rats fed a methyl-deficient diet are able to eliminate Se via formation of TMSe.\r"

Ceruloplasmin activity was significantly increased within 24 h and remained elevated for at least 72 h after a single injection of 13-cis retinoic acid. With daily injections of retinoic acid, the ceruloplasmin activity continued to increase for at least 4 d. After 4 d, the activity was four times control levels. In copper-deficient rats, the ceruloplasmin activity did not increase in response to retinoic acid unless copper was also given to these rats 8 h after retinoic acid. Actinomycin D blocked the retinoic acid-induced stimulation of ceruloplasmin activity in copper-sufficient rats, but in copper-deficient rats only about half of the increase was blocked when the rats were given copper or copper and retinoic acid. By use of pulse-labeling techniques, ceruloplasmin synthesis was shown to increase 1.5-fold after retinoic acid and this increase was blocked by actinomycin D. When vitamin A-deficient rats were repleted with 13-cis retinoic acid for 3 or 5 d, both the ceruloplasmin activity and synthesis were significantly stimulated when compared to the nonrepleted, deficient rats. Therefore, the dietary components, copper and vitamin A, play an important role in the regulation of plasma ceruloplasmin levels.\r"

Forty 3-wk-old rats were divided into groups receiving 30, 150, 300, 600 or 900 mu eq sodium/d for 5 wk. The minimal daily requirement for normal growth was 300 mu eq Na, or about 60 mu eq/g of new growth. Lower doses caused dose-related growth failure associated with a reduced ECFV. Analyses of carcass, muscle and bone composition were carried out. In sodium-deprived animals there was retarded growth of protoplasm, fat and bone; the mineral composition of muscle was not altered, whereas in bone calcium concentration was reduced. Plasma concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride remained normal. Pair-feeding indicated that sodium-deficiency growth retardation could not be attributed to starvation. Sodium-deficient animals ingested a greater amount of food per gram of weight gain, possibly reflecting an increased energy expenditure. Sodium deprivation initially permitted protoplasmic growth to proceed at a rate disproportionate to that of the ECFV. Subsequently, both continued to grow at a reduced but similar rate, suggesting that ECFV may be a controller of protoplasmic growth.\r"

Each individual's average intake of nutrients and standard deviation over the year were assumed to reflect his or her \"usual\" intake and day-to-day variability. Confidence intervals (P less than 0.05) for each individual's usual intake were constructed, and from these the number of days of dietary records needed for estimated individual and group intake to be within 10% of usual intake was calculated. The results indicated that the number of days of food intake records needed to predict the usual nutrient intake of an individual varied substantially among individuals for the same nutrient and within individuals for different nutrients; e.g., food energy required the fewest days (averaging 31) and vitamin A the most (averaging 433). This was considerably higher than the number of days needed to estimate mean nutrient intake for this group, which ranged from 3 for food energy to 41 for vitamin A. Fewer days would be needed for larger groups.\r"

The authors examined the practices of medical house officers in obtaining blood cultures, an important part of this evaluation, as well as the ability of these physicians to predict bacteremia in febrile patients. They studied all 344 medical inpatients who experienced episodes of fever during two 30-day periods, as well as all 50 cases of bacteremia detected during these and two additional 30-day periods. House officers drew blood for culture within one day after the onset of fever in 52% of fever episodes. In 20% of these episodes only one set of cultures (representing one venipuncture) was obtained. House officers estimated the likelihood of bacteremia to be 20% or less in 15 of 40 bacteremic patients. They failed to obtain blood cultures promptly in 10% of bacteremic episodes and in 27% of episodes where the cause of fever was a nonbacteremic bacterial infection. They obtained prompt blood cultures in only a bare majority of febrile episodes, frequently underestimated the likelihood of bacteremia, and inadequately sampled blood for bacteremia. In this study, clinical judgment was not an adequate substitute for routinely obtaining blood cultures for febrile medical inpatients.\r"

Medication-taking patterns were measured with a small pill dispenser that electronically records the time of medication removal. Blood pressure reduction was found to correlate better with the total number of doses the patient removed from the pill pack during a month than with any of four other compliance measures that were based on the timing of dose removal. Analysis also suggested that blood pressure is improved if patients ingest omitted doses to \"catch up\" to the prescribed regimen. It is concluded that a simple pill count may be the most clinically relevant definition of compliance for patients with hypertension being treated with only hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, and that such patients should ingest all prescribed doses, regardless of the time interval between doses.\r"

The intervention consisted of a brief orientation to cost containment issues, a pamphlet that outlined practical cost containment strategies and listed the charges for commonly ordered tests and services, and access to detailed interim patients' bills generated during the hospitalization. Two concurrent control services received no intervention. Over 1,600 admissions were evaluated. The geometric mean length of stay was 0.61 days shorter on intervention services compared with control (5.15 vs. 5.76 days, p less than 0.01). The geometric mean hospital charges were $388 less for intervention patients ($3,199 vs. $3,587, p less than 0.005). Neither patients' demographic characteristics nor case mix could explain the reductions. The authors conclude that a simple program utilizing information already in existence in most hospitals can result in a significant and meaningful reduction in length of stay and charges.\r"

The authors investigated the clinical status of 274 patients initially and six months after they sought care at one of three primary care sites. Through use of the highly structured Diagnostic Interview Schedule, they found that physicians assigned a depressive diagnosis to only a fourth of the patients so assessed by the structured interview. Nevertheless, the rates of persisting major depressive disorders at follow-up were found to be very similar for patients whom both the structured interview and the physician initially considered depressed and those so diagnosed by structured interview but not by the physician (25% and 31%, respectively). An analysis of factors associated with course of illness suggests that psychiatric status at the initial assessment and the number of assigned medical diagnoses rather than the physician's recognition and treatment of depression strongly predict continued affective disorder.\r"

Transcripts were scored for physician proficiency using expert-generated criteria and were content-analyzed to assess the process of communication and information content. Relevant patient disclosure was also scored from the transcripts based on expert-generated criteria. Findings were: 1) On the whole, physicians elicited only slightly more than 50% of the medical information considered important according to expert consensus, with a range from 9% to 85%. 2) Both open and closed questions were substantially related to patient disclosure of medical information to the physician, but open questions were substantially more so (Pearson correlations of 0.37 and 0.72, respectively). 3) Patient education, particularly information regarding prognosis, cause, and prevention, was substantially related to patient disclosure of medical information to the physician (Pearson correlations of 0.44, 0.36, and 0.34, respectively). 5) Finally, clinical expertise was only weakly associated with patient disclosure of medical information to the physician (Pearson correlation of 0.16).\r"

To accomplish this, data collected in the late 1970s by three national organizations were joined and analyzed with the aid of experts in internal medicine. Although graduate medical education has evolved since this information was gathered, it does provide a baseline for assessing the impact of changes on the cognitive skills of residents. The findings suggest that better program performance on the examination is associated with attracting more knowledgeable residents to begin with and that programs are able to maintain the advantage of their residents throughout training. Moreover, program characteristics have an impact on the cognitive skills of residents over and above what would be predicted by test scores at the end of medical school. Programs with better examination performance tend to provide residents an extensive, well-supervised educational experience stressing ambulatory care.\r"

Approximately two thirds of the smokers reported ever having been advised to stop smoking by their current physicians. In univariate and multivariate analyses, the presence of a smoking-related illness, the number of prior attempts to quit, and the duration of cigarette smoking were significantly related to delivery of smoking cessation advice by physicians. Knowledge of factors that affect the provision of advice to stop smoking can be used to enhance the physician's role in smoking intervention.\r"

In most patients, resting energy expenditure was above normal (range 95% to 153% of predicted values for age, sex, and weight as derived from the Harris Benedict equations), and was negatively correlated with pulmonary function (P less than 0.01) and nutritional status (P less than 0.01) when expressed as a percentage of body fat. Pulmonary status was positively correlated with nutritional status (P less than 0.01). We conclude that resting energy expenditure in patients with cystic fibrosis exceeds normal values and that the increase correlates with a deterioration in lung function and nutritional status.\r"

Chicken liver spread containing up to 420 IU/g vitamin A was the likely source of intoxication. Markedly elevated circulating retinyl ester levels have persisted in the surviving sibling for 3 subsequent years despite severe restriction of vitamin A intake. A therapeutic trial of the carbohydrate-derived complexing agent 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was initiated. Circulating retinyl esters transiently increased during the infusion (from 407 to 4791 micrograms/dL), and urinary total vitamin A excretion, undetectable before infusion, increased to 23 micrograms/dL after infusion. The frequency of hypervitaminotic episodes has decreased somewhat in the 2 years since the infusion, probably related to dietary vitamin A restriction. The occurrence of this syndrome in two brothers, while a sister ingesting the same diet remains completely healthy, suggests an inherited variance in tolerance to vitamin A intake.\r"

Modality survival rates at 36 months with CAPD, CCPD, or both were 20%, 93%, and 87%, respectively. Use of CCPD as the primary dilaytic method increased during the study period. The peritonitis rate was one episode per 11.8 patient treatment months and was similar with both CAPD and CCPD. Gram-positive organisms were cultured in 34% of these episodes of peritonitis. Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis was associated with a recurrence rate of 40% and led to catheter replacement in 45% of the episodes. Peritoneal membrane failure necessitating switching to hemodialysis was related to peritonitis in three patients. Of the 74 peritoneal catheters that required replacement, 70% were infected. Serial serum levels of urea nitrogen, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase remained stable, whereas serum creatinine level rose slightly over time. Episodes of hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia were observed at a frequency of one episode per 12.2, 4.6, and 2.5 treatment months, respectively. Blood transfusions were required in once per 1.5 and 3.3 treatment months in seven anephric patients and in 35 patients with their own kidneys, respectively (P = 0.05). In prepubertal patients who received CAPD or CCPD for greater than 1 year, little or no improvement in growth occurred in relationship to either chronologic or bone age.\r"

The clinical features, renal biopsy findings, and subsequent course were studied retrospectively in 48 children with such GBM changes to compare findings in those with and without a family history of nephritis and to determine the significance of the GBM changes in patients with nonfamilial disease. All 48 patients had hematuria. For 30, there was hematuria in at least one other member of the family (familial hematuria group); for 18, there was no familial incidence. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to clinical and pathologic findings. At the latest follow-up six boys with familial hematuria and three boys with nonfamilial hematuria had reduced renal function, and nine boys with familial hematuria and four boys and one girl with nonfamilial hematuria had neurosensory deafness. Our study results show that children with these GBM changes, with or without a family history of hematuria, tend to have a progressive course, with frequent occurrence of neurosensory deafness, and that the prognosis is more severe in boys. These observations suggest that such GBM changes in patients with nonfamilial hematuria may represent new mutations for hereditary nephritis.\r"

ANOVA comparison of cocaine, methamphetamine, and cocaine plus methamphetamine groups revealed no significant differences in perinatal variables. The Finnegan withdrawal scoring scheme demonstrated that all three groups of infants had altered neonatal behavioral patterns, characterized by abnormal sleep patterns, poor feeding, tremors, and hypertonia. Infants exposed to cocaine or methamphetamine or both were combined and compared with both narcotic-exposed and drug-free mother-infant pairs matched for known maternal risk factors. All drug-exposed groups had significantly higher rates of prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation and smaller head circumferences than did the drug-free comparison group. A significantly higher rate of placental hemorrhage occurred in the cocaine plus methamphetamine group. Stepwise multiple regression analysis assessed the independent contribution of maternal factors; cocaine or methamphetamine was adversely, negatively associated with gestational age, birth weight, length, and occipitofrontal circumference. The increased rate of prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and perinatal complications associated with perinatal exposure to cocaine or methamphetamine was greater than that predicted by coexisting risk factors and was consistent with the pharmacologic properties of these drugs.\r"

  ".W": "We created a model for studying the cardiovascular and pulmonary effects of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature lambs with respiratory distress. In 47 fetal lambs at 129 to 133 days gestation (term, 145 days), we infiltrated the ductus arteriosus with formalin and placed a mechanical occluder about it so that its patency could be regulated. Two days later the lambs were delivered, given sheep surfactant, paralyzed, and their lungs mechanically ventilated. These premature lambs could more than double their left ventricular output when challenged with increasing degrees of left-to-right shunts through the PDA. This was accomplished by an increase in stroke volume, not by an increase in heart rate. During the 40-minute observation period, there was no change in dynamic compliance or functional residual capacity while the ductus was patent. When the ductus was patent, there was a significant increase in arterial PaO2 (even with small left-to-right shunts) and a decrease in PaCO2 (with large shunts). Despite the heart's ability to handle the increased volume load of a PDA, there were significant alterations in individual organ blood flows, resulting from a combination of decreased perfusion pressure and localized vasoconstriction. The abdominal organs had significant reductions in blood flow even with small PDA shunts. This decrease in organ blood flow may explain some of the pathophysiologic manifestations of PDA in preterm infants.\r"

The concentrations of bupivacaine or lidocaine necessary to result in a 50% depression of the maximum upstroke velocity were about 10(-5) and 10(-4) M, respectively. The concentrations necessary to completely block the slow action potentials were about 10(-4) M for bupivacaine and 5 X 10(-4) M for lidocaine. The relative potencies of lidocaine to bupivacaine in abolishment of the slow action potentials are in the ratio of 1:5. These results suggest that local anesthetics do affect the slow Ca++ channel of ventricular muscle.\r"

Local ganglionic blocking doses (total of 5 mg per injection) of hexamethonium were injected into the pulmonary vein-atrial fat pad to block selectively right and left vagal inputs to the SAN region without interrupting vagal inputs to AVN. Conversely, hexamethonium injected into the inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial pad selectively blocked vagal control of arteriovenous conduction without interfering seriously with vagal control of SAN function. Vagal ganglia situated in pulmonary vein-atrial fat pad also exercise moderate but incomplete control of right atrial contractile force. Lesser vagal control of atrial inotropism is localized in the inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial fat pad. Ganglia situated in a large fat pad on the dorsal epicardial surface of the left atrium (left atrial fat pad) appear to play little or no role in SAN or AVN regulation, although some left preganglionic axons may pass through it en route to the AVN region. Vagal stimulation is associated with prompt and profoundly negative chronotropic and dromotropic responses, but in response to the same stimulation, a negative change in atrial contractile force is much slower in development and is much longer lasting. Such precise anatomical localization and differentiation of the intrinsic vagal regulation of SAN, AVN and contractile force opens new avenues of research on the neural regulation of cardiac performance.\r"

Treatment with either PB, 3-MC or BNF increased markedly the unbound intrinsic clearance of diflunisal. Saline-treated control rats showed a greater unbound intrinsic clearance of diflunisal than oil-treated controls indicating that repetitive treatment with oil had an effect on enzyme activity. Treatment with 3-MC and BNF appeared to cause a decrease in the biliary clearance of ether and ester glucuronide, but PB had little effect on the biliary clearance of glucuronides. Rats pretreated with PB showed a 3-fold increase in the fractional metabolite formation clearance of ether glucuronide and a 2-fold increase in the fractional metabolite formation clearance of ester glucuronide, suggesting differential effects of PB on ester and ether glucuronidation. A similar trend, but to a smaller extent, was also observed for 3-MC- and BNF-treated rats. These results suggest the possibility of selective induction of multiple forms of UDP-glucuronyltransferase involved in metabolism of diflunisal.\r"

  ".W": "The binding of [3H]leukotriene (LT) C4 to membranes from human bronchi has been characterized. The specific binding, measured at 4 degrees C, was very rapid, equilibrium being attained within 1 to 5 min. The binding was also rapidly reversible and saturable (maximum binding = 187 pmol/mg of protein). LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and the LT antagonist FPL 55712 competed with [3H]LTC4 for its binding sites, with the following IC50 values: 0.12; 2.3; 30; and 20 microM. Therefore, the binding sites displayed a higher affinity for LTC4 than for the other sulfidopeptide LTs. Computer-assisted analysis of either the saturation or the competition curves for LTC4 indicated the existence of two classes of binding sites with different affinities (Kd1 and Kd2 = 70 nM and 0.58 microM, respectively), in agreement with the curved semilog plot of the dissociation time course. CaCl2 or MgCl2 increased and GTP or 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate did not decrease the specific binding. In addition, the distribution of the binding sites for [3H]LTC4 along the human respiratory tree was investigated. At a fixed (10 nM) [3H]LTC4 concentration, membranes obtained from bronchi removed at different levels of the airway tree did not bind LTC4 in a significantly different amount. This is compatible with the finding that LTC4 receptors should be present on bronchi of various caliber, as both small and large airways respond to LTs.\r"

All three compounds increased heart rate in the former preparations, and their intrinsic activities relative to isoproterenol were 0.7, 0.65 and 0.45, respectively. The positive chronotropic effects of cicloprolol or xamoterol were competitively antagonized by betaxolol or propranolol; however, part of those induced by pindolol were resistant to these beta adrenoceptor antagonists. None of these compounds increased the spontaneous beating rate of isolated guinea pig atria; however, xamoterol only increased heart rate in isolated rat atria, and its intrinsic activity with respect to isoproterenol was 0.4. Pindolol, xamoterol and cicloprolol behaved as competitive beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists against isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in a pithed rat model. In order to mimic the intrinsic effects of the partial agonist drugs, control dose-response curves for isoproterenol were determined in pithed rats in which the base-line heart rate was elevated by thoracic spinal cord stimulation. In this in vivo preparation, xamoterol and pindolol were more potent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists than cicloprolol; however, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were selective for beta-1 adrenoceptors. In isolated spontaneously beating guinea pig right atria, cicloprolol and xamoterol were equipotent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists but were about 50 times less potent than pindolol. In isolated rat atria, the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist potency of xamoterol was greater (pA2 = 8.7) than in guinea pig atria (pA2 = 7.8). The potencies of cicloprolol and pindolol did not vary between these species. In catecholamine-depleted rats, high i.v. doses of cicloprolol had vasodilator activity that was partly mediated by beta-2 adrenoceptors. In carbachol-contracted guinea pig trachea, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were relatively inactive against isoproterenol-induced relaxation. In conclusion, cicloprolol and xamoterol, similarly to pindolol, behave as agonists and antagonists of beta-1 adrenoceptors. However, only cicloprolol and xamoterol show an elevated degree of selectivity toward the beta-1 adrenoceptor subtype.\r"

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potential mediator of some of these effects. We investigated the effects of PAF infusions in unanesthetized sheep and the effects of the PAF receptor antagonist L-652,731 [trans-2,5-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran] on the hematologic, hemodynamic and biochemical alterations produced by infusions of both ZAP and PAF. Infusions of 2 to 20 micrograms of PAF in 0.25% ovine serum albumin-saline produced pulmonary hypertension, hypoxia and dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and thromboxane synthesis. The effects of a 2 micrograms of PAF infusion were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those produced by a ZAP infusion. Pretreatment with aspirin (10 mg/kg) protected the sheep against the pulmonary vascular response to 20 micrograms of PAF and blocked completely the thromboxane synthesis. L-652,731 at a dose of 8 mg/kg blocked completely the neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, thromboxane synthesis, pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia induced by 5 micrograms of PAF, but this protective effect was not observed in animals infused with ZAP. These results indicate that PAF is probably not a mediator of the neutropenia, thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia which result from the infusion of ZAP into sheep.\r"

  ".W": "In the search of the most accurate animal model for studies on fat cell adrenoceptor regulation, the characterization of dog fat cell beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptor properties was carried out using selected radioligands and biological measurements of fat cell function. Moreover, the distribution of dog fat cell adrenoceptors and the functional consequences were explored in fat deposits from different anatomical locations (perirenal, omental and s.c. adipose tissue). Beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptors involved in the control of the lipolytic activity of dog fat cells exhibit pharmacological characteristics which are very similar to those defined in human adipocytes. However, in contrast with the results obtained in human adipocytes, there is a preponderance of beta over alpha-2 adrenergic binding sites, whatever the location of the fat deposits, in the dog. The higher values of the ratio beta-sites over alpha-2-sites were found in perirenal adipocytes whereas the lowest values of this ratio were found in s.c. deposits. A close positive relationship exist between alpha-2 adrenoceptor number, alpha-2 adrenergic responsiveness and fat cell volume. To conclude, beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptors exhibit similar pharmacological properties in dog and human fat cells. Variations according to the anatomical location of the fat deposits exist in both species. However, as opposed to human fat cells, it is evident that the balance between beta and alpha-2 adrenergic responsiveness is predominantly under the control of beta adrenoceptors in dog fat cells.\r"

Intrarenally administered pinacidil (0.4, 2.0 and 10 micrograms/kg/min) produced a dose-related increase of renal blood flow, without altering mean arterial pressure. The glomerular filtration rate significantly increased only with the highest dosage. Pinacidil caused a dose-related augmentation of urine formation and, when given at 10 micrograms/kg/min, increased urine flow and urinary excretion of electrolytes to about 10 times and 3 to 9 times over the respective control value. In comparison, hydralazine (4.0 and 20 micrograms/kg/min) produced no significant diuretic action and bradykinin, given at a dose (0.02 micrograms/kg/min) equipotent to pinacidil (10 micrograms/kg/min) with respect to increasing renal blood flow, was less effective. Pinacidil administration significantly increased the fractional excretion of phosphate. Thus, pinacidil-induced diuresis seems to be due mainly to the vasodilating effect on renal vessels, with some contribution from an inhibitory effect on sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubules.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine inhibits immunoglobulin E-dependent histamine release when preincubated with human basophil leukocytes before challenge. Two distinct mechanisms for this inhibition have been demonstrated. The first we suggest to be an A2-purinoceptor mediated mechanism. This effect, which is apparent with both 15- and 60-min preincubation periods, is mimicked by 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine, blocked by 8-phenyltheophylline but not dipyridamole and is associated with the ability of adenosine to elevate cyclic AMP. The second, which is mimicked by 3-deazaadenosine and is associated only with the longer 60-min preincubation period, is reversed by dipyridamole but not by 8-phenyltheophylline suggesting it to be an intracellular mechanism. Its enhancement by homocysteine thiolactone and reversal by exogenous S-adenosyl methionine suggests it to result from increasing intracellular S-adenosyl homocysteine levels. Our failure to detect increased 3H-methyl incorporation into chloroform-methanol extractable lipids after immunoglobulin E-dependent activation would indicate that inhibition of S-adenosyl methionine methylation reactions are an unlikely mechanism. As both prior stimulation of A2-purinoceptors and elevation of intracellular S-adenosyl homocysteine enhance and prolong the cyclic AMP response consequent upon immunoglobulin E-dependent activation, this represents a common mechanism by which histamine release may be suppressed.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate a physiological function of substance P (SP) present in the peripheral ending of sensory neurons, we determined immunoreactive SP (iSP) levels in the s.c. perfusate and the amount of edema evoked in rat paw by noxious heat stimulation. We found that immersion of rat paw into hot water (47 degrees C) for 30 min led to a significant increase of iSP in the perfusate and about 50% increase in paw volume. Neonatal pretreatment with capsaicin inhibited significantly the increase in both iSP and paw volume evoked by noxious heat stimulation. Acute and chronic denervation of the sciatic and saphenous nerves also inhibited the heat-evoked iSP release and edema remarkably. Intraplantar injection of SP evoked an increase in paw volume in dose-dependent manner. This increasing effect of SP on paw volume was more substantial than that produced by histamine. Simultaneous treatment with stem bromelain and emorfazone decreased significantly the heat-evoked iSP release and edema. These results suggest that 1) SP produced by noxious heat stimulation in the periphery may be released from the afferent fibers with small-diameter, 2) bradykinin may intervene in this SP release and 3) SP released in the periphery may be closely related to the edema formation of the thermal injury reaction.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacological effects of xamoterol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonistic activity, were examined in guinea pig cardiac preparations and compared with those of isoproterenol to assess possible mechanisms of its cardiac stimulant actions. Xamoterol produced a positive inotropic effect in the papillary muscles and a positive chronotropic effect in the spontaneously beating right atria in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum inotropic and chronotropic effects of xamoterol were about 33 and 35% of those of isoproterenol, respectively. Although xamoterol failed to produce a consistent increase in contractile force in the left atria, the positive inotropic effect of the agent was observed clearly in preparations obtained from reserpine-pretreated animals. The positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of xamoterol were antagonized by atenolol, but not by ICI 118,551. On the other hand, xamoterol antagonized competitively the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoproterenol. In papillary muscles the increases in contractile force induced by xamoterol and isoproterenol were depressed markedly in the presence of carbachol or adenosine. In all of left atria, right atria and papillary muscles obtained from reserpine-pretreated animals, xamoterol caused a significant elevation in cyclic AMP levels, while inhibiting the isoproterenol-induced increase in cyclic AMP levels. Computer-assisted analysis of concentration-response curves for the inhibition by xamoterol of the binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol in the membranes from guinea pig ventricles showed the existence of the 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate sensitive, highly affinity site of beta adrenoceptors for xamoterol, suggesting that xamoterol may induce the formation of a ternary complex with the beta adrenoceptor and a stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Isoproterenol (ISO) was used as a model substrate for the extraneuronal uptake of catecholamines. The accumulation of ISO when catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (EC 2.1.1.6) was inhibited by 3',4'-dihydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (U-0521) was decreased by ischemia to about 50% of the control value. Ischemia decreased the formation of 3-O-methyl-ISO, a major metabolite of ISO formed by COMT, to about 30% of that in the control hearts. The efflux of extraneuronally accumulated ISO in the heart with and without ischemia was measured. The diffusion constant calculated by the slope of the efflux rate of ISO or by the efflux rate divided by the amount of ISO remaining in the heart after ischemia was about 50% of the control. The experiments showed that ischemia suppressed the extraneuronal O-methylating system (extraneuronal uptake, COMT and diffusional flux) in the rat heart. Such suppression may lead to higher concentrations of local catecholamines in myocardial infarction.\r"

In the present investigation, the effects of (-)-desmethoxyverapamil on action potential (AP) and force of contraction in heart muscle preparations and on tension and 45Ca influx in vascular smooth muscle are described. In part, the effects were compared with the (+)-isomer of desmethoxyverapamil and the isomers of both verapamil and methoxyverapamil. In atrial and/or ventricular heart muscle preparations from guinea pigs, cats and man, (-)-desmethoxyverapamil decreased the force of contraction and shortened the AP duration. Slow response APs were depressed, whereas dV/dtmax of phase 0 of the AP remained unchanged. The rank order of potency of the (-)-isomers was as follows: desmethoxyverapamil greater than methoxyverapamil greater than verapamil. Potassium-induced contractures and 45Ca influx were depressed by the (-)-isomers of desmethoxyverapamil, methoxyverapamil and verapamil in the same potency rank order as observed in heart muscle. The (+)-isomers exerted qualitatively similar effects at about 10 to 200 times higher concentrations. Correspondingly, the increase in potency of the racemic mixtures of the drugs was accompanied by increases in stereoselectivity. It is concluded that (-)-desmethoxyverapamil is the most potent stereoselective calcium antagonist of the verapamil type with respect to its effects on heart and vascular smooth muscle.\r"

Properties of Na-K pump activity were determined by measurement of [3H]ouabain binding and 86Rb uptake by myotubes after incubation of myotubes in ethanol (217 mM) for up to 9 days. Chronic ethanol exposure caused an increase in Em, an increase in electrogenic pump component of Em and a decrease in depolarizing response to addition of ethanol to the myotubes. Chronic ethanol also produced increases in Na-K pump sites and in Na-K pump activity. Thus, chronic ethanol treatment causes a compensatory increase in amount and activity of the Na-K pump, and this results in an increased expression of the electrogenic pump component of Em. These effects may represent the membrane expression of tolerance to the depressant effects of ethanol.\r"

Ischemia was induced by lowering the afterload pressure of the perfused working rat heart. The activities of cathepsin D, beta,N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase were determined in the nonsedimentable and sedimentable fractions after centrifugation of the tissue extract to assess the subcellular distribution of lysosomal enzymes. After ischemia, decreases in the mechanical function and the tissue level of high-energy phosphates were observed. In addition, ischemia caused subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes from the lysosomes to the cytoplasm. Reperfusion of the ischemic heart did not restore the mechanical function and the level of high-energy phosphates completely. Diltiazem (2.21 X 10(-6), 1.11 X 10(-5) and 2.21 X 10(-5) M) was provided for the heart 5 min before the onset of ischemia. Diltiazem preserved high-energy phosphates in the ischemic heart, and inhibited the subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes being caused by ischemia, depending on its concentration. Reperfusion after ischemia with diltiazem recovered the mechanical function that had been decreased by ischemia. These results may indicate that diltiazem can protect the myocardium against ischemic damage.\r"

Myocardial pH (MpH) was measured by means of a micro glass pH electrode. MpH before partial occlusion was 7.52 to 7.66. Partial occlusion decreased the left anterior descending coronary artery flow by 49 to 68%, MpH by 0.58 to 0.76 and myocardial contractile force by 26 to 43%, and increased ST segment (surface electrocardiogram) by 3.2 to 11.7 mV. Lidocaine (injected i.v. 30 min after partial occlusion) decreased heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial contractile force, and attenuated the decrease in MpH during ischemia. Lidocaine in doses of 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg restored the myocardial [H+], that had been increased by partial occlusion, by 23, 38 and 50%, respectively. Even in the paced heart, lidocaine (10 mg/kg) attenuated the myocardial acidosis, although the degree of attenuation was smaller (36%). Partial occlusion elevated the ST segment even in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/kg of lidocaine. In the nonischemic heart, however, lidocaine (2, 5 or 10 mg/kg) did not change in MpH. It is concluded that lidocaine attenuates the myocardial acidosis during ischemia, and the primarily important mechanism of pH attenuation is not a decrease in heart rate.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to utilize a number of 5-HT agonists in order to provide insights into the general function of the serotonergic system in the regulation of central sympathetic pathways. The 5-HT1A agonists 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin and p-aminophenyl-ethyl-m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine produced a dose-related inhibition of sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) recorded from either the postganglionic inferior cardiac nerve or the preganglionic splanchnic nerve in chloralose-anesthetized cats. The sympatholytic effects of 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin and p-aminophenyl-ethyl-m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine were accompanied by hypotension and bradycardia. The effects of 5-HT1A agonists were reversed by the 5-HT1A antagonist spiperone. In contrast, spiperone alone produced decreases in blood pressure, heart rate and SND. The 5-HT1B agonists 1[3(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-piperazine, 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine and 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine all produced variable effects on SND. In some experiments, SND was increased by these agents, whereas it was decreased in others. The 5-HT2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane produced a marked increase in SND. A second 5-HT2 agonist, MK212, produced similar effects. The role of 5-HT receptor subtypes in mediating the 5-HT excitation of sympathetic neurons is discussed. It is suggested that 5-HT1A agonists inhibit SND through a process of disfacilitation by inhibiting the firing rate of 5-HT neurons. Possible mechanisms by which 5-HT2 agonists increase SND are proposed.\r"

J. Coates, D.G. Weetman and their co-workers have concluded that Sgd 101/75 is selective for a subtype of alpha-1 receptors, i.e., alpha-1s. The present studies have shown that Sgd 101/75 was a full agonist in the rat anococcygeus muscle and acts at alpha-1 adrenoceptors, as determined by Schild analysis of prazosin antagonism (pKB = 9.24 +/- 0.21, slope = 0.87 +/- 0.13). Alkylation experiments showed that the contractile effects of Sgd 101/75 were more sensitive to POB than the effects of NE. These experiments also allowed the determination of KA values for these agonists (Sgd 101/75 KA = 1.5 +/- 0.6 X 10(-5) M, NE KA = 2.6 +/- 1.0 X 10(-6) M). At 3 X 10(-8) M POB (10 min), the contractile effect of Sgd 101/75 was eliminated, whereas the concentration-effect curve for NE was shifted approximately one log unit to the right with a 20% decrease in maximal response. After similar POB treatment, incubation with Sgd 101/75 (60 min, 3 X 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-4) M) shifted the NE curve to the right in a concentration-dependent manner. Schild regression of these data yielded a pKB = 5.22 +/- 0.09 and slope = 0.87 +/- 0.08. This pKB (-log KB) showed that Sgd 101/75 was competing for the same receptor after POB treatment and before POB treatment (mean of -log KA = 4.92 +/- 0.12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For each experiment, subjects first sampled placebo and a dose of one of the drugs (mazindol: 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg; benzphetamine: 25 and 50 mg; phenylpropanolamine: 12.5, 25 and 50 mg; phenmetrazine: 25 and 50 mg; all p.o.). Subjects were then allowed to choose between drug and placebo on five separate occasions. The relative frequency with which active drug was chosen over placebo was used as an index of the drug's reinforcing efficacy. Subjective effects were measured with an experimental version of the Profile of Mood States, a short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory and a series of visual analog scales. The rank order for reinforcing efficacy was benzphetamine approximately phenmetrazine greater than placebo greater than phenylpropanolamine much greater than mazindol. Ratings of drug liking were positively correlated with number of drug choices for each drug. Benzphetamine and phenmetrazine produced subjective effects characteristic of amphetamine-like drugs and increased ratings of drug liking. Mazindol produced only dysphoric subjective effects and decreased ratings of drug liking. Phenylpropanolamine had no significant effects on subjective measures or drug-liking ratings. These findings are consistent with the presumed dependence potential of these compounds, and demonstrate the validity of this experimental paradigm for assessing the reinforcing effects of anorectics in normal human volunteers.\r"

CGS 15943A was devoid of intrinsic activity, and did not affect either histamine- or KCl-induced contractions of the smooth muscle strips. In the electrically stimulated guinea pig left atrial preparation, CGS 15943A antagonized the A1 receptor-mediated negative inotropic effects of R-phenylisopropyladenosine with a pA2 value of 7.4. In vivo, i.v. administration of CGS 15943A blocked the vasodepressor response to 2-chloradenosine in anesthetized normotensive rats with an ID50 of 0.024 mg/kg. In addition, p.o. administration of CGS 15943A (4.0 mg/kg) to conscious rats inhibited 2-chloroadenosine-induced decreases in diastolic blood pressure; maximal effects were observed 30 min after dosing, with a T1/2 of approximately 103 min. Therefore suggesting that CGS 15943A is an orally active antagonist of adenosine receptors. These results indicate that CGS 15943A antagonized both A1 and A2 receptor-mediated responses with a greater affinity toward the A2 than the A1 receptor subtype.\r"

The present study tested the hypothesis that the negative chronotropic action of ATP in the canine sinus node is dependent on its degradation to adenosine. Increasing doses of the following compounds were administered in the sinus nodal artery of 12 open chest dogs (either sex, 30-35 kg) anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg i.v.): adenosine, ATP, alpha,beta methylene-ATP (AMPCPP) and beta,gamma methylene-ATP (AMPPCP). Right atrial, His bundle and right ventricular electrograms as well as Lead II ECG and systemic arterial blood pressure were monitored continuously and recorded. The depressant effects of test compounds on the sinus node were assessed from the prolongation of sinus cycle length and the duration of junctional escape rhythm which they induced. Data were used to plot dose-response curves for the four test compounds. The order of potency was adenosine greater than or equal to ATP greater than or equal to AMPPCP much greater than AMPCPP = 0. In 3 of 12 dogs the emergence of junctional escape rhythm was observed after the highest dose of either adenosine, ATP or AMPPCP. In addition, aminophylline, a selective competitive inhibitor of adenosine at P1-purinoceptor site, reduced the effects of maximal doses of adenosine, ATP and AMPPCP by 52 +/- 7, 67 +/- 8 and 72 +/- 6%, respectively (each, P less than .05; AMPPCP vs. adenosine, P less than .05). The present data indicate that the negative chronotropic action of ATP is due to its rapid catabolism to adenosine and the action of adenosine at P1-purinoceptor sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent in vitro evidence suggests the existence of stretch-activated calcium channels in cerebrovascular smooth muscle. These channels, which may play a role in cerebral autoregulation, also appear resistant to antagonism by the benzothiazepine calcium antagonist diltiazem, an agent known to block potential-sensitive and receptor-operated calcium channels. If cerebral autoregulation involves stretch-sensitive diltiazem-resistant calcium channels, then autoregulation should remain intact during vasodilatation produced by diltiazem. The present study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Using a canine cerebral venous outflow preparation, experiments were first performed to determine the optimum dose and route of administration for diltiazem. Although continuous i.v. diltiazem (1-100 micrograms/kg/min) did not increase cerebral perfusion at any normotensive dose, i.a. (lingual artery) diltiazem at 10.0 micrograms/kg/min increased cerebral blood flow by 36% and decreased cerebrovascular resistance by 31% without significant effects on blood gas levels, cerebral oxygen uptake, cardiac output or mean arterial pressure. In autoregulation experiments, 10.0 micrograms/kg/min of diltiazem significantly attenuated but did not eliminate autoregulatory responses to increases (inflation of an aortic balloon) and decreases (hemorrhage) in cerebral perfusion pressure. Autoregulatory responses to increases and decreases in perfusion pressure were equally affected by diltiazem, but both were unaffected by i.a. saline. These data support the view that cerebral autoregulation involves both diltiazem-sensitive and diltiazem-resistant mechanisms. The diltiazem-resistant mechanisms, which may include the proposed population of stretch-sensitive calcium channels appear to account for up to one-half of the autoregulatory capacity in the cerebral circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Indirect evidence suggests that metabolism of procainamide (PA) may be necessary for generation of its autoimmunity-inducing capacity. Reactive metabolites of PA produced by hepatic mixed function oxidases have been identified by their capacity to bind proteins covalently. The present study extends these findings by comparing the toxicity of various chemically synthesized metabolites of PA to a variety of cell lines and primary cultures. PA and its N-acetyl- and N-acetyl-N-oxide-derivatives were nontoxic to S49.1 cells at concentrations up to 5 mM, whereas nitro-Pa (4-nitro-N-(diethylaminoethyl)benzamide hydrochloride) and azoxy-PA (bis-N,N'-(diethylaminoethyl)-4,4'-azoxydibenzamide) displayed partial cytotoxicity at 1 and 0.1 mM, respectively. (The therapeutic range of PA is 0.02-0.05 mM.). In contrast, hydroxylamine-PA (4-hydroxylamino-N-(diethylaminoethyl)benzamide hydrochloride) was highly cytotoxic, producing a TD50 between 0.002 and 0.045 mM among the eight cell lines tested. Hydroxylamine-PA sensitivity correlated with cell reducing capacity, suggesting that redox cycling contributes to cytotoxicity. The hydroxylamine metabolite of PA undergoes spontaneous air oxidation to the nitroso-derivative (nitroso-PA). When this oxidation was minimized by rapid manipulations or inhibited by ascorbic acid, cytotoxicity was reduced or eliminated, suggesting that the nitroso-derivative may be the toxic metabolite. Quiescent peripheral blood lymphocytes, especially T-cells, were relatively insensitive to hydroxylamine-PA when evaluated by dye exclusion 1 day after drug exposure. However, massive DNA strand breaks were detectable in these cells immediately after drug exposure, and resting lymphocytes treated with 0.01 mM hydroxylamine-PA died slowly during the subsequent week.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of changes in norepinephrine availability on alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness were determined in several regions of rat brain. Receptor density was determined from specific 125I-BE 2254 binding, and responsiveness was determined by norepinephrine-stimulated increases in inositol phosphate accumulation and in cyclic AMP accumulation in the absence or presence of adenosine in slices where beta adrenergic receptors had been inactivated. Adrenergic input was reduced by destroying noradrenergic neurons with DSP-4, depleting amines with chronic reserpine treatment or blocking alpha-1 adrenergic receptors with chronic prazosin treatment. All three treatments caused similar increases in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density in cerebral cortex but not in striatum or hippocampus. DSP-4 treatment increased the maximal cyclic AMP response to both norepinephrine and phenylephrine but did not alter the maximal inositol phosphate response or the maximal potentiation of the cyclic AMP response to adenosine. DSP-4 treatment also increased the potency of norepinephrine in activating all three responses in cerebral cortex. Adrenergic input was increased by chronic treatment with desmethylimipramine to block norepinephrine reuptake, chronic i.c.v. infusion of norepinephrine or chronic yohimbine treatment to block presynaptic autoreceptors. None of these treatments caused significant changes in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density or functional responsiveness in any region studied. The results suggest that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness in rat brain can be increased but not easily decreased. They also suggest that different brain regions are affected differently by alterations of adrenergic input and that the different responses are not coregulated.\r"

LY195115 and Cl-930 were the most potent vasorelaxant agonists (ED50 approximately 10(-7) M), whereas piroximone and amrinone were the least potent (ED50 approximately 10(-5) M). In addition to these positive inotropic agents, vascular relaxation was examined further for a series of novel dihydropyridazinones, and relaxant potencies correlated directly with the ability of these agents to inhibit an isozyme of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac muscle (SR-PDE) (r = 0.87, P less than .01). This excellent correlation suggests that vascular relaxation produced by these agents is related to their ability to inhibit a vascular enzyme similar or identical to SR-PDE. Furthermore, LY195115, milrinone and isomazole (10(-4) M) produced significant increases in both aortic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Time courses for these changes were consistent with a role for cyclic nucleotides in relaxation; however, differences between the relative increases in cAMP or cGMP produced by these drugs were evident. Removal of the aortic endothelium had no effect upon relaxation produced by milrione and only a modest (approximately 2-fold decrease in potency) effect on relaxation produced by LY195115 and isomazole, indicating that the relaxant effect of these cardiotonics is primarily an endothelium-independent event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor in membranes from rat submandibular gland was studied using radioligand binding assays with 125I-VIP and various unlabeled competing ligands. In addition to the necessity of working within the parameters under which all radioligand binding assays should be performed, binding studies with 125I-VIP, as with other peptide hormones and neurotransmitters, are subject to additional technical difficulties. Specific problems that were addressed included radioligand proteolysis, the identification of an effective protease inhibitor (leupeptin) and the deleterious effects of a commonly used inhibitor (bacitracin); avid radioligand absorption to incubation tubes that was eliminated by precoating of the tubes with a combination of polyethylenimine and an organosilane; and a disproportionate effect of increasing membrane protein concentration on affinity estimates. Under optimized conditions, the affinity (Kd) and density Bmax values for 125I-VIP obtained from saturation assays (76 pM, 2.0 pmol/mg) were in excellent agreement. Membrane protein (or receptor) levels beyond the linear portion of the receptor concentration curve are often used in radioligand binding assays. Results from 125I-VIP binding studies at elevated receptor concentrations revealed the predicted marked decrease in receptor affinity. In addition, the rank order potency of unlabeled ligands in inhibition binding assays was changed. The optimization of the assay for measuring VIP receptors in submandibular gland membrane provides a reliable method for studying the role of receptor regulation in stimulus-secretion coupling for this neuropeptide.\r"

Blockade of the negative chronotropic effect of bolus i.v. injections of 2-chloroadenosine, R-phenylisopropyladenosine and N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine was utilized as an index of antagonism at A1 receptors; blockade of the hypotensive effect of the same series of adenosine agonists was used as an index of activity at A2 receptors. In addition, blockade of the potentiating effect of adenosine on the hypertensive and chronotropic effects of nicotine was studied to assess further the role of A1 and A2 adenosine receptors in this response. The potent antagonist XAC displayed considerable A1 selectivity as demonstrated by blockade of adenosine receptor-mediated bradycardia at doses 5- to 10-fold lower than those antagonizing adenosine receptor-mediated hypotension. XAC also selectively blocked potentiation by adenosine of the positive chronotropic effect of nicotine, at doses which had minimal effects on the enhancement of the hypertensive effect of nicotine. The caffeine homolog 7-methyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine exhibited A2 selectivity as demonstrated by prevention of adenosine receptor-mediated hypotension at doses which only minimally attenuated the bradycardiac effect of adenosine analogs. Caffeine displayed no selectivity for A1 vs. A2 adenosine receptors. The results indicate that selective analogs such as XAC and F-methyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine will be useful probes for investigation of receptors involved in the physiological functions of adenosine.\r"

The simultaneous addition of somatostatin 14 and oxotremorine elicits a nonadditive convergent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Both L363 and oxotremorine nonadditively stimulate a high-affinity guanosine 5'-triphosphatase activity of hippocampal membranes. This stimulation could be operative in mediating the convergent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity elicited by the binding of specific ligands to somatostatin and muscarinic recognition sites present in hippocampal membranes. Because L363 competitively displaces muscarinic agonists fand antagonists from their specific recognition sites, one might infer that the two recognition sites interact functionally; that is, somatostatin reduces the efficacy of oxotremorine and/or vice versa.\r"

Saturation isotherms of the ventral and dorsal spinal cord yielded Kd values 1.9 to 2.3 nM for [3H]R-PIA and 18.1 to 19.5 nM for [3H]NECA. The Bmax for [3H]NeCA was approximately twice the Bmax for [3H]R-PIA in ventral and dorsal halves (267 vs. 128 fmol/mg of protein and 402 vs. 206 fmol/mg of protein, respectively). Displacement of specific [3H]NECA binding by the A2-selective agonist, 2-(phenylamino)adenosine, the relatively nonselective antagonist, theophylline and six A1-selective agonists, R-PIA, S-PIA, N6-(cyclohexyl)adenosine, N6-(cyclopentyl)adenosine, N6-(m-aminophenyl)adenosine and N6-(m-iodophenyl)adenosine, revealed two [3H]NECA binding components with the characteristics of A1 and A2 receptors. All curves best fit a two-site model when analyzed by the computer program LIGAND. R-PIA, N6-(cyclohexyl)adenosine and N6-(cyclopentyl)adenosine were the most potent displacers at the first site (Ki = 0.6-1.4 nM). All A1-selective agonists were poor displacers of [3H]NECA at the second site (Ki = 0.6-18.6 microM). The A2-selective agonist, 2-(phenylamino)adenosine, was as potent as R-PIA in displacing [3H]NECA from this site with a Ki value 0.57 microM. Finally, the A1 and A2 adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition and stimulation of adenylate cyclase were demonstrated directly in synaptic membranes prepared from the spinal cord.\r"

Marked reductions (30-60%) in the concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were observed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and midbrain at 2 weeks after a 4-day treatment regimen of MDMA or MDA; less consistent reductions in serotonin (5-HT) content were observed in these brain regions. In addition, both MDMA and MDA caused comparable and substantial reductions (50-75%) in the density of [3H]paroxetine-labeled 5-HT uptake sites in all brain regions examined. In contrast, neither MDMA nor MDA caused any widespread or long-term changes in the content of the catecholaminergic markers (i.e., norepinephrine, dopamine, 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid) or in the number of [3H]mazindol-labeled norepinephrine or dopamine uptake sites in the brain regions examined. These data demonstrate that MDMA and MDA cause long-lasting neurotoxic effects with respect to both the functional and structural integrity of serotonergic neurons in brain. Furthermore, our measurement of reductions in the density of 5-HT uptake sites provides a means for quantification of the neurodegenerative effects of MDMA and MDA on presynaptic 5-HT terminals.\r"

  ".W": "The administration of amphetamine to rats results in a relatively wide range of individual differences in responsiveness, both in the initial behavioral patterns as well as in the augmentation response to repeated administration. Therefore we examined the possibility that such differences might reflect intrinsic variation in neurochemical mechanisms regulating responsiveness to amphetamine. Animals were administered a transitional dose (1.75 mg/kg) of amphetamine with regard to the induction of locomotion and continuous stereotypy. On the basis of individual response profiles animals could be separated into two markedly different subgroups, one displaying continuous locomotion (S1), characteristic of lower amphetamine doses, and the other exhibiting a multiphasic pattern, including a prolonged focused stereotypy phase (S2), typically associated with higher amphetamine doses. Examination of regional brain monoamine and metabolite levels revealed distinguishing patterns between the subgroups only in the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems. With repeated amphetamine administration, the two prominent factors of the augmentation, the emergence of stereotypy and the enhancement of locomotion during the last half of the response, were dissociable between the subgroups. The emergence of stereotypy was confined to S1 animals, whereas only the S2 subgroup displayed the progressive increase in locomotion. Differences in the responsiveness of neurochemical systems to amphetamine rather than pharmacokinetic factors appear to underly the distinct behavioral profiles associated with the two subgroups. The results indicate that characterization of individual responses may be required to determine accurately the neurochemical mechanisms involved in the behavioral effects of amphetamine.\r"

Intravenous infusions of DPX (4.0 micrograms/kg/min) produced increments in HR, CCF and renal blood flow and decrements in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The sequential administration of atenolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) administered at a dose selective for beta-1 adrenoceptors, propranolol (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) and the DA1 dopamine receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) blocked the DPX-induced changes in HR, CCF, MAP and renal blood flow, respectively. After ganglionic blockade, the increments in HR and CCF produced by DPX (4.0 and 16.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) were reduced 90 and 76%, respectively, with little or no change in its hypotensive effect. In separate dogs, administration of the beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (0.55 microgram/kg i.v.) produced a comparable decrement in MAP but smaller increments in HR and CCF than produced by DPX (16.0 micrograms/kg i.v.). DPX (64 micrograms/kg i.v.) also produced greater increments in HR during cardioaccelerator nerve stimulation (1 Hz, 0.5 msec, supramaximal voltage) than before nerve stimulation. Therefore, we tested the effect of DPX (1.0, 4.0 and 8.0 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) on the increments in HR, CCF and MAP produced by norepinephrine (0.25 microgram/kg i.v.) and the indirect acting sympathomimetic amine, tyramine (60 micrograms/kg i.v.). DPX potentiated the increments in HR, CCF and MAP produced by norepinephrine and suppressed those produced by tyramine. Thus, the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of DPX in the intact dog are due primarily to baroreceptor-mediated stimulation and inhibition of neuronal uptake of norepinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine receptors in the 7315a transplantable rat anterior pituitary tumor were characterized using radioligand binding assays with [3H]spiroperidol ([3H]SPD) and assays of adenylate cyclase activity. Scatchard analysis of the binding of [3H]SPD yielded linear plots and a Kd value of 73 pM. Studies of the inhibition of the binding of [3H]SPD were performed with a series of competing ligands, including the antagonists domperidone, (+)-butaclamol and sulpiride and the agonists dopamine, bromocriptine and N-propylnorapomorphine. Inhibition curves for the antagonists gave Hill coefficients of approximately 1, consistent with the presence of only a single class of binding sites with a high affinity for [3H]SPD. In contrast, the Hill coefficient for dopamine was significantly less than 1. When assays were carried out in the presence of 300 microM GTP, the inhibition curve for dopamine was shifted to the right and the Hill coefficient increased to approximately 1. An effect of GTP on the affinity of a receptor for agonists is consistent with the existence of at least two agonist affinity states. Inhibition of the binding of [3H]SPD by the partial agonist bromocriptine was not affected when assays were carried out in the presence of GTP. The uniform low affinity of the selective serotonin antagonist ketanserin for these sites indicated that the radioligand was not labeling serotonin-2 receptors in this tissue. A good correlation was observed between the Ki values for competing ligands measured in the tumor and in homogenates of rat striatal tissue. Dopamine was shown to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the metabolism of angiotensin peptides by tissue angiotensinases, aminopeptidases A, B, M and leucine aminopeptidase have been identified as being particularly effective. Because the inhibitory actions of amastatin (AM) and bestatin (BE) are relatively specific for these aminopeptidases, we have examined the effects of these inhibitors on the binding, degradation and pressor activity of angiotensin II (AII) and angiotensin III (AIII). Within 30 min at 37 degrees C, significant metabolism of 125I-AII and 125I-AIII by homogenates of a block of tissue containing hypothalamus, thalamus, septum and anteroventral third ventricle regions of the brain was observed. A majority of 125I-AIII metabolism was due to soluble peptidases, whereas that of 125I-AII primarily resulted from membrane-bound peptidases. AM, BE and reduced incubation temperatures significantly decreased the metabolism of 125I-AII and 125I-AIII. After appropriate adjustments to reflect the proportion of intact radioligand bound, temperature- or inhibitor-induced decreases in metabolism were matched by corresponding increases in specific binding. Heat-treated bovine serum albumin, as a nonspecific peptidase inhibitor, had no effect on either the metabolism or binding of the ligands used. In accordance with their actions in vitro, i.c.v. administration of AM and BE prolonged the pressor activity of subsequently applied AII and AIII. Unexpectedly, the amplitude of the pressor response to AIII was increased by BE, whereas that to AII was decreased by AM. The results of this study indicate that the metabolism of AII and AIII by aminopeptidases is relatively specific and acts to modulate the actions of these peptides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anesthetic drugs, including barbiturates, chloroform, diethylether and ethanol, inhibited the binding of TBPS and enhanced the GABA-dependent influx of chloride. In the presence of bicuculline, barbiturates increased the binding of TBPS, but this action was not shared by other anesthetic agents. Inhibition of TBPS binding was found with drug concentrations that produce anesthesia in vivo, whereas augmentation of GABA action occurred at subanesthetic concentrations. Effects of a series of n-alcohols (methanol to decanol) were studied on TBPS binding and membrane fluidity (using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as a fluorescent probe). The potencies of the alcohols for inhibiting TBPS binding and fluidizing synaptic membranes were similar to their anesthetic potencies, but there were differences in the relative potencies of the drugs for inhibition of TBPS binding and membrane fluidization. These results, together with effects of assay temperature, suggest that effects of anesthetics on the GABA receptor-chloride channel complex were not due to changes in bulk membrane fluidity. Correlation of anesthetic potencies of chemically diverse agents with both inhibition of TBPS binding and augmentation of GABA-dependent chloride flux suggests a role for the GABA complex in anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The thermodynamic properties of pirenzepine (PZ) binding to membrane-bound and digitonin-solubilized muscarinic receptors (mAChR) from the rat forebrain and heart were evaluated. Apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of PZ were measured from saturation studies using [3H]PZ for forebrain membrane-bound mAChR and from inhibition studies of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding using unlabeled PZ, at five different temperatures from 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C. The Kd values of PZ binding to both membrane-bound and solubilized mAChR decreased with decreasing temperature whereas the maximum receptor density was unchanged. The heterogeneity of membrane-bound mAChR characterized by PZ binding to mAChR from both tissues disappeared upon digitonin-solubilization of the mAChR. The magnitude of changes of the Kd values with temperature was greater in the solubilized mAChR, suggesting that some constituents in the membrane constrained the affinity changes. The Gibbs free energy of PZ binding to membrane-bound and solubilized mAChR were both negative. The Gibbs free energy for membrane-bound receptors decreased (more negative) whereas those for solubilized receptors increased (less negative) with increasing temperature. The change in entropy was the apparent major driving force for PZ binding to membrane-bound receptors with the change in enthalpy also being favorable. The change in enthalpy was the apparent major driving force for PZ binding to solubilized receptors at all temperatures with the change in entropy being unfavorable above 17 degrees C in the rat forebrain mAChR and above 10 degrees C in the heart mAChR. Our results suggest an important role for the biomembrane microenvironment and possible topographical differences in the binding sites which may contribute to the mechanism of muscarinic subtypes.\r"

Correlation with histologic findings revealed the considerable diagnostic accuracy of the technique: its reliability approaches 100% when one deals with endometrial neoplasia, 87.5% with high-risk hyperplasia and 65.2% with low-risk hyperplasia. The diagnosis cannot rely on hysteroscopic examination only. A biopsy can be performed during the examination or immediately thereafter. In 54.1% of AUB patients, no endometrial changes could be detected on hysteroscopy and biopsy. Curettage, therefore, would have resulted in overtreatment of these patients. Moreover, the usefulness of dilatation and curettage in about half of AUB patients over 45 should be questioned seriously.\r"

Seven hundred forty-three multiple gestation pregnancies (1.2%) and 1,632 major congenital anomalies (2.7%) were identified. The corrected perinatal mortality rate was 13.8 deaths per 1,000 births. This study revealed that prematurity, postdatism, congenital anomalies, low Apgar scores and neonatal complications, including respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, persistent fetal circulation, intracerebral hemorrhage and seizure activity, were major factors contributing to mortality. This analysis suggests that a further reduction in mortality should follow a reduction in preterm deliveries and their sequelae and the early identification and management of maternal and fetal antenatal complications.\r"

Approximately half these volunteers (165) were nulligravidas, and 309 (97.5%) were white. Despite instructions on proper tablet usage, there were 416 cycles (8.9%) in which one or more tablets were missed. Only one pregnancy occurred, in a cycle in which a total of four tablets was missed, for an uncorrected Pearl index of 0.28 pregnancies per 100 woman-years of usage. No pregnancy resulted from method failure, indicating a 100% efficacy rate for Triphasil when taken properly. The mean length of the menstrual cycle with Triphasil was 27.9 days; the mean length of menses, 4.4 days; and the mean latency period, 2.1 days. Menstrual flow was average in 64.1% of the subjects, light in 34.1%, heavy in 1.3% and variable in 0.5%. Amenorrhea during the tablet-free interval occurred in only 0.6% of the 4,692 cycles in which Triphasil was used. Breakthrough bleeding occurred in 6.9% of first cycles and 3.2% of total cycles; spotting, in 10.7% of first cycles and 4.4% of total cycles. Other symptoms that occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 1% were acne (1.0%), appetite increase (1.2%), breast discomfort (2.8%), breast enlargement (1.3%), gastrointestinal symptoms (1.7%), simple headache (1.4%) and nausea (1.1%).

We developed a Functional Status Index (FSI) and assessed its validity in 47 patients with hip fracture by comparing it to the results of objective functional performance tests.

  ".W": "Faculty practice plans are under scrutiny at many academic medical centers as teaching hospitals seek ways to encourage their physicians to increase their clinical activities. Discussions with physicians at two medical schools yielded insights into the faculty members' perspective on faculty practice plans. Interviews disclosed that the physicians were satisfied with a practice plan if they felt their professional goals were in balance with the institution's goals. Changes in the plan can either sustain institutional values or introduce new priorities. In view of physicians' loyalty to a particular plan and their anxiety in the face of change, the authors suggest that it may be better to modify an established plan than to impose a new system. The physicians interviewed agreed that strong chairmen can work within any plan to reward faculty members for research, clinical, or administrative contributions and thus to determine a department's directions and character. In considering changes in a practice plan, chairmen, deans, and administrators need to weigh the faculty's values and commitments.\r"

This reliance on written examinations is due to their ease of use and perceived objectivity and occurs despite the fact that the examinations assess few components of clinical competence. Simulated patients can standardize the presentation of a patient problem; and, if the patients are employed in an assessment in a manner parallel to the design of written test items, the assessment can have an objectivity similar to that enjoyed by written tests. Such an assessment allows the major components of clinical competence to be tested. The results and feasibility of using simulated patients in a multiple-station assessment of an entire senior class in January 1986 are described. A second assessment was administered to a different senior class in December 1986. This latter assessment was designed in collaboration with another medical school that administered the same assessment to its senior students in March 1987.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to make the geographic distribution of physicians closer to the distribution of the population as a whole, in 1971 the states of Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho established the WAMI Program. In a departure from the Flexnerian model of medical education, the WAMI Program was organized to distribute the components of medical education throughout the region, both at the medical center at the University of Washington School of Medicine and at remote sites. In the present article, the authors describe the results of the first seven years of the program (1975-1981) in terms of the geographic and specialty distribution of the school's graduates before and after the establishment of the program. At the time of the study, 23 percent of the graduates with WAMI Program experience practiced in nonmetropolitan areas as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Only 13 percent of all U.S. physicians practiced in such areas in 1981, while 24 percent of the U.S. population lived there. In addition, 61 percent of the graduates with program experience were in primary care practice in contrast to 35 percent of all U.S. physicians. If all U.S. physicians behaved as these graduates do, the distribution of U.S. physicians would be reversed, with the proportion of physicians practicing primary care in nonmetropolitan areas being larger than the proportion of the population living in those areas.\r"

The focus of the study was on the recognition and recall of critical cues within cases as a function of problem difficulty and the organization of clinical information. Two clinical cases in two structural forms (typical and random) were designed, and the participants' written recall of the cases was analyzed using the techniques of discourse analysis. The results show that the physicians recalled significantly more critical cues than the medical students. However, when the case had a temporally ordered, underlying disease process, the random structure of the text disrupted both the physicians' ability to recall critical cues and the accuracy of their diagnoses. The medical students were unaffected by problem type or structural form in the amount of information they recalled. The results show that the physicians and medical students formulate the information from clinical problems differently, and this difference is due to the fact that the physicians recognize patterns of familiar problems with respect to critical cues but the students do not.\r"

These changes in student behavior occurred during a period in which the pharmacology faculty implemented changes that anticipated the recommendations of the Panel on the General Professional Education of the Physician and College Preparation for Medicine of the Association of American Medical Colleges. These changes included encouraging independent learning, reduced lecture time, and increased problem-solving.

Using an application of generalizability theory, which extends beyond classical test theory to establish estimates of multiple-error sources, the investigators calculated reliability-like coefficients for each of the services. The coefficients were .95 and .85 for the two general medicine services, .67 for cardiology, and .88 for hematology-oncology. These findings indicate that the questionnaire is a reliable instrument for assessing humanistic behavior and identifying reliable raters in groups of nurses.\r"

To analyze the frequency and risk factors for hypothermia and its effect on patient outcome, we prospectively studied 94 intubated injured patients at a regional trauma center during a 16-month period. Esophageal temperature probes were placed in the field or ER and core temperatures (T) were followed for 24 hours or until rewarming. Patients were designated as normothermic (greater than 36 degrees C), mildly hypothermic (34 degrees C-36 degrees C) or severely hypothermic (less than 34 degrees C) based on initial T. The risk factors for hypothermia evaluated included age, severity and location of injuries, blood alcohol level, blood transfusion requirements, and time spent in the field, ER, or OR. The average initial T was 35 degrees C, with no seasonal variation. Injury severity and survival correlated with severe hypothermia. Normothermic patients had an average ISS of 28 with a 78% survival. Severely hypothermic patients had an average ISS of 36 with a 41% survival (p less than 0.05). Patient age strongly correlated with outcome although there was no relationship between age and initial temperature. Sixty-two per cent of patients tested were positive for blood alcohol, and one half were legally intoxicated (BAC greater than 100 mg%). However, no consistent correlation was found between alcohol intoxication and initial temperature or patient survival. Blood transfusion requirements paralleled injury severity and patients receiving greater than 10 unit transfusions had significantly lower core temperature (p less than 0.05). The average temperature change was positive in the ER, OR, and ICU with time to rewarming correlating with the aggressiveness of warming measures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, the impact of body core hypothermia on outcome in 71 adult trauma patients with Injury Severity Scores (ISS) greater than or equal to 25 was analyzed. Forty-two per cent of the patients had a core temperature (Tc) below 34 degrees C, 23% below 33 degrees C, and 13% below 32 degrees C. The mortality of hypothermia patients was consistently greater than those who remained warm, regardless of index core temperature.

Mortality and the incidence of hypothermia increased with higher ISS, massive fluid resuscitation, and the presence of shock. Within each subgroup (i.e., greater ISS, massive fluid administration, shock) the mortality of hypothermic patients was significantly higher than those who remained warm. No patient whose core temperature fell below 32 degrees C survived.\r"

The data indicate a striking absence of autoregulation of NBF, but MBF, as expected, displayed close autoregulation. The vascular mechanisms which regulate resting NBF following hemorrhage differ from those in both muscle and skin: during hypotension, the calculated neurovascular resistance was unchanged, while the resistance in muscle fell and that in the skin increased.\r"

In the present study we review 51 consecutive injured loggers requiring transfer to a regional Level I trauma center. The average age was 34 years and the mode of injury in 67% was being struck by a falling or rolling log. Orthopedic intervention was required most frequently (49%), with neurologic injury in 43%. Two patients died (4%), both secondary to severe head injury, and both survived less than 24 hours. Importantly, while most severely injured patients survived, they required long hospitalizations and had a 58% permanent disability, with more than half of these being brain or spinal cord related. Although the overall number of workers involved in logging is small, the young average age, the work years lost, and the high risk of permanent disability support continued strong efforts to improve overall safety. Particularly, the high incidence of head injury argues strongly for improved and increased use of safety helmets, which may significantly impact the mortality and morbidity of logging accidents.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that rapidly expanded random pattern skin flaps demonstrate enhanced resistance to bacterial invasion from intradermal injection of Staphylococcus aureus in a porcine model. Sites for a 6 X 12 cm expanded, a 6 X 9 cm sham-expanded, and a 6 X 6 cm acute random pattern skin flap were outlined, but not elevated, on the backs of 14 white pigs. A 450-cc tissue expander inserted beneath the panniculus carnosus at the site for expansion was sequentially filled to the limits of skin viability each day for 5 days. At the sham site a tissue expander was similarly inserted but left unexpanded; the acute flap site was left undisturbed. On day 8, flaps were elevated, immediately sutured in place, and 0.1 ml of saline solution containing 10(7) Staphylococcus aureus inoculated intradermally at four corresponding sites in each flap and at three sites in normal skin. In seven animals these sites were at the proximal base of the flaps; in seven others the sites were distal. The resulting areas of erythema and skin ulceration were measured on each of the next 3 days and the measurements compared. At corresponding proximal sites, the mean area of erythema and ulceration measured over the next 3 days in expanded flaps (31.2 mm2) and in sham-expanded flaps (33.8 mm2) was significantly less than in acute flaps and control skin (47.5 mm2, 43.4 mm2, p less than 0.05). Measurements in the rapidly expanded flaps were not significantly different than those in the sham-operated expanded flaps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The clinical status of the patients in the field and in the E.R. was quantified by Trauma Score (TS) as well as Physiologic Index (PI), ranging in severity from 20 (clinically dead) to 5 (stable). The anatomic injury severity was expressed by Penetrating Trauma Index (PTI). Survival was analyzed according to the type of injuries: noncardiac and cardiac. The overall survival was 10%. There was only one survivor with noncardiac injuries. Sixty-nine patients had cardiac penetration, 33 in Group I (stabilization) and 36 in Group II (immediate transport). Despite attempts at stabilization, none of the patients in Group I showed an improvement in clinical status from the scene to the emergency room. There were a higher number of patients arriving at the E.R. with signs of life in Group II compared to Group I. In Group II patients, survival was significantly improved overall (p = 0.01), in patients with signs of life on arrival at the hospital (p = 0.02) and in patients with isolated right ventricular wounds (p = 0.01) compared with Group I. The anatomic injury severity (PTI) as well as the mode of injury in the two groups was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88011373\r", 
  ".W": "Exogenous steroid administration has been shown to increase post-traumatic nitrogen excretion in adults. Children sustaining head injuries and treated with steroids have previously been shown to have markedly increased total urinary nitrogen levels; the amount of nitrogen excreted is also directly related to the degree of injury, as evidenced by the Modified Injury Severity Score (MISS). It is unclear whether the increased protein breakdown in these patients is a result of the head injury or a result of the catabolic effects of steroids. Nineteen children aged 4-14 years, suffering head injuries, were prospectively studied. In ten children, management included steroid administration (1-1.5 mg/kg/day dexamethasone X 3-5 days); the remaining nine were similarly managed; however, without steroids. The groups were matched for age, weight, MISS, and Glasgow Coma Scale Score. The steroid-treated group showed a significantly higher urinary nitrogen excretion (mean, 256 +/- 24 mg/kg/day) than the nonsteroid-treated group (mean, 172 +/- 29 mg/kg/day) (p less than 0.02). These data suggest that steroids potentiate an already accelerated post-traumatic catabolic response seen in children with head injuries. Our data suggest that steroid use, which is common, mandates aggressive nutritional support in the management of children with head injuries.\r"

  ".W": "Of 210 multiple trauma patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 12 (5%) presented with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation with an FIO2 of 1.0 because of severe intrapulmonary shunting (IS). Five (42%) of these patients survived and two (17%) died because of their underlying respiratory failure. We found a mean of three etiologic factors in each patient to account for their IS. Nonsurvivors had a lower cardiac index than survivors when they first needed FIO2 of 1.0 and ARDS was more frequent among this group. All patients who survived were in severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in the first 5 days post-trauma; all patients who needed FIO2 of 1.0 later than 5 days post-trauma died. Data collected for patients with similar degree of respiratory failure in coronary care ICU (n = 18), in medical ICU (n = 19), and surgical ICU (n = 21) demonstrated that multiple trauma patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure were younger and were hospitalized and ventilated for longer periods of time. In multiple trauma patients, as for patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, death was seldom related to respiratory failure itself. We concluded that severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in trauma patients is usually of mixed etiologies. It is a serious cause of morbidity in these patients; however, mortality is seldom directly related to this condition. Severe IS occurring shortly after trauma is of better prognosis than late IS.\r"

The no-restraint group had more massive head injuries, thoracic injuries, and liver and spleen injuries than the restraint group. Classic \"seatbelt syndrome\" injuries were seen in the seatbelt group. The overall Injury Severity Scores were not significantly different between the groups. Despite mandatory legislation, many children do not use restraints, and many who do still suffer severe or fatal injuries. We conclude that better compliance with existing passenger restraint laws and more effective restraint systems are needed.\r"

The mortality rate was 16%, and no deaths were attributable to splenic injury. Indications for surgery were hemodynamic instability in 46% and positive peritoneal lavage in 40%. Group B included 22 patients, 17 of whom were managed nonoperatively with no deaths. Five patients eventually went to laparotomy. Fifty per cent of all patients had associated intra-abdominal injury but only 17% needed repair; 31% of patients were initially managed conservatively with a 77% success rate and no mortality.

Fracture location, cause of injury, neurologic deficit, and delay in diagnosis were all documented: 22.9% of cervical injuries, and 4.9% of the thoracolumbar injuries had a delayed diagnosis ranging from less than 1 day to 36 days. The causes of delayed diagnosis were: 1) failure to take X-rays, 2) fractures missed on X-ray, and 3) failure of patients to seek medical attention. Associated factors such as intoxication of the patient, multiple injuries, level of consciousness, or two levels of spinal injury contributed to the delayed diagnosis of these injuries. Certain \"at-risk\" populations for missed spinal injuries have been identified. In spite of delays in diagnosis, progression of an established neurologic deficit did not appear to occur in our study. However, the development of secondary deficits was significant in the delayed diagnosis group.\r"

Eight (11.9%) died in the thoracic group; all survived in the mediastinal group, for an overall mortality of 10.5%. Shock was associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the thoracic group (T) and infection was the most frequent complication for the entire group of patients under study.

Initial anterior external fixation aided in resuscitation of hemodynamically unstable patients and allowed early mobilization. Delayed posterior internal fixation avoided infection and hemorrhage but failed to achieve anatomic reduction of disrupted sacroiliac joints and sacral fractures. Followup examination confirmed maintenance of fixation and fracture healing but pain and persistent neurologic deficits were common findings. Lumbosacral nerve plexus injuries occurred in patients with fractures through the sacral foramina. Fixation of these fractures with sacroiliac screws and transiliac rods caused overcompression and the resulting foraminal encroachment may be a factor in the lack of neurologic recovery. In this study, delayed posterior internal fixation was not associated with perioperative morbidity and achieved better reductions than those obtained with external fixation alone. Delaying the fixation, however, increased the difficulty of obtaining anatomic reduction of certain posterior arch disruptions.\r"

The complexity of these residual percutaneous cases necessitated repeat endoscopic or fluoroscopic stone removal procedures in 20 per cent and ancillary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in 22 per cent, and led to a slightly higher complication rate than in our previous percutaneous series. Despite the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous methods still are necessary for comprehensive therapy of upper tract urolithiasis.\r"

Typical radiation exposures to the patient have been assessed from the experimental data. The total amount of radiation exposures a patient is likely to receive has been estimated to be approximately 26 roentgens, for example 21 roentgens from 3 to 4 minutes of fluoroscopic exposure and 5 roentgens from 8 frames of video spot filming. The scattered radiation has been found to be approximately 0.5 mR. per hour at 3 feet or 91 cm. from the center of the lithotriptor water tank.\r"

  ".W": "The results of 471 extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatments in 465 patients with solitary ureteral stones managed by several different techniques are reported. In situ treatment was performed in 123 cases without instrumentation and in 47 after placement of a ureteral catheter. Retrograde stone manipulation was performed in 245 cases immediately before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and an additional 56 were manipulated with ureteral stent placement at least 1 week before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. The success rate was significantly greater if the stone was manipulated into the kidney before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Significantly less energy (p less than 0.0001) was required for complete disintegration if the stone was free floating in the kidney. The need for subsequent procedures was significantly less (p less than 0.0001) for stones manipulated successfully into the kidney. Complications were infrequent, with the most common being ureteral perforation in 5.1 per cent of the cases, all of which were managed conservatively. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is the treatment of choice for proximal ureteral calculi because it is less morbid than percutaneous approaches and provides significantly better results than ureteroscopy. An attempt at manipulation of proximal ureteral calculi back into the kidney should be made before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\r"

Of these patients 6 showed a simultaneous aneurysm of the abdominal aorta verified either by computerized tomography, ultrasound, arteriography or during an operation. Of the patients 14 were operated on primarily because of ureteral obstruction, 2 because of aortic aneurysm and 1 because of rupture of the abdominal aorta. Advanced fibrosis with varying amounts of inflammation was detected in all 17 patients. The same histological pattern was present in patients with aneurysm of the abdominal aorta and in those without aneurysm. Accompanying vasculitis with destruction of the vascular wall was noted in 8 patients, including 6 with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. In 3 patients who underwent aneurysm resection as well as in 1 patient with aortic rupture the process extended into the aortic wall. The only patient with vasculitis and no aortic process suffers from severe rheumatoid arthritis. On the basis of the different histological findings we suggest that retroperitoneal fibrosis with vasculitis and aneurysm may represent a distinct pathological entity.\r"

Of the patients 1 woman and 2 men had bladder substitution: in 2 the bladder neck and urethra were preserved, and in 1 man radical cystoprostatectomy with preservation of the distal sphincteric mechanism was performed. All 3 patients currently are continent. In the 8 diversion patients an anti-incontinence mechanism was reconstructed with a segment of plicated ileum sutured to the abdominal wall. Six patients are completely dry between catheterizations every 4 to 6 hours, 1 man requires more frequent catheterizations, and the woman has refused self-catheterization and wears an external appliance. There were 18 ureterointestinal reimplantations performed successfully for upper tract protection, and 1 ureterocolonic reimplantation became partially obstructed and required percutaneous dilation. Reflux did not occur. This remodeled right colonic segment, reconstructed with interruption of the intestinal circular fibers, allows for storage of large urine volumes at reasonable pressures and it is a suitable alternative bladder substitution procedure. Plicated ileum has allowed for easy catheterization and it has been an adequate anti-incontinence mechanism when associated with this colonic reservoir.\r"

Six patients were treated for 1 to 3 weeks at 3 to 8 months postoperatively. The treatments reduced the frequency of spontaneous reservoir contractions, as well as the basal and contraction pressures of the reservoirs. The reservoir capacities were increased modestly. These alterations in reservoir dynamics were accompanied by a decrease in the cramping characteristically associated with reservoir distension and increased intervals between reservoir catheterization. Two patients who had incontinence after initially successful operations regained continence during treatment. No systemic side effects were observed, although dilution of the drug may be required to prevent reservoir irritability. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate instillations may prevent acute and possibly long-term pressure-related complications of continent urinary reservoirs constructed from intact cecum and ascending colon.\r"

  ".W": "We studied postoperatively 14 men who underwent urinary diversion with a Camey ileal bladder in association with radical cystoprostatectomy. Clinical and urodynamic evaluations revealed that the ileal bladder provides a moderate pressure reservoir (mean pressure at capacity 37 cm. water) and offers the patient reliable daytime continence. The mean capacity of 362 ml. allows for a voiding interval of 2.2 hours but it is not adequate for storage of urine produced through the night, so that nocturnal enuresis results universally. Even after 2 years of followup the tubular-shaped ileal reservoir maintained physiological contraction waves of segmentation and peristalsis typical of human ileum. Voiding is accomplished by abdominal straining and an intraluminal pressure of more than 50 cm. water is required to maintain the urine flow. Mean peak flow rate was 19 ml. per second. Reflux was prevented successfully in 86 per cent of the renal units. Metabolic acidosis was seen in 43 per cent of the patients. While the ileal bladder falls short of being the ideal form of continent urinary diversion, it offers a psychologically attractive technique to selected and highly motivated male patients faced with the need for urinary diversion.\r"

Some patients were followed by urine cytology and flow cytometry during treatment of tumors. There was a good correlation of the 3 parameters in relatively high grade tumors (II and III) but an inconsistent appearance of cells in the urine diagnosable by either urine cytology or flow cytometry for low grade lesions. High grade flat neoplasms may be detectable by urine cytology and flow cytometry before they are visible on endoscopy. Flow cytometry may indicate urothelial proliferation before it is apparent on urine cytology. Exfoliative benign lesions are diagnosed readily by the combination of urine cytology and flow cytometry. In benign and malignant lesions shedding of viable cells and, therefore, accessibility to urine cytology and flow cytometry are inconsistent. The need for repeated examinations in the case of low grade lesions suggests that the method is not reliable for single test screening programs but it is a valuable means of followup in cases of suspected or diagnosed disease.\r"

The distribution of blood groups was similar to that reported for the general population and to that of 100 consecutive patients with urolithiasis used as controls, and the distribution was not different among patients with superficial cancer (stages O and A) than in those with advanced disease (stage B or higher). However, among patients with superficial disease high grade (III or IV) lesions were more frequent in those with blood group O (36 per cent) than in those with other blood groups (13 to 18 per cent) (p less than 0.001). In addition, in patients with superficial cancer of all grades progression to advanced disease was significantly greater among those with blood group O (37 per cent) than in those with other groups (12 to 16 per cent) (p less than 0.05). More importantly, in patients with low grade (I or II) superficial cancer development of advanced disease was significantly more frequent among those with blood group O (24 per cent) than in those with other blood groups (0 to 7 per cent) (p less than 0.004). Our findings suggest that individual genetic factors influence the natural history of superficial bladder cancer. The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains to be elucidated.\r"

The interval to recurrence did not differ significantly among the 3 groups. The failure of a negative postoperative cytology study to predict a durable response to treatment by transurethral resection reflects the polychronotopic nature of superficial bladder tumors in this select patient population and suggests the need for adjuvant therapy.\r"

Subsequent tumor recurrence was defined as a positive biopsy or visible papillary tumors on cystoscopic examination. All 8 patients with a positive postoperative cytology study had tumor recurrence at a median interval of 4 months. Of the 9 patients with a suspicious study 7 (77.8 per cent) had recurrent tumor at a median interval of 7 months and 2 (22.2 per cent) had no evidence of disease at 16 and 19 months, respectively. Of the 34 patients with a negative postoperative cytology study 13 (38.2 per cent) had tumor recurrence after a median interval of 4 months and 21 (67.8 per cent) had no evidence of disease after a median of 25 months. The tumor recurrence rate in patients with a positive or suspicious postoperative cytology study was significantly greater than that of patients with a negative study (p equals 0.001, Fisher's exact test).

All patients underwent standard initial and subsequent evaluative procedures and the average followup was 62 months. Half of the patients had a history of stage Ta and/or T1 transitional cell carcinoma. The remainder had carcinoma in situ when first diagnosed (10 had carcinoma in situ only).

There were 18 patients who had a complete response following chemotherapy, 11 had a partial response (positive cytology) and 11 failed (persistent carcinoma in situ). Patients with a history of transitional cell carcinoma had a statistically significantly greater probability of achieving a complete response. Despite other types of treatments only 2 of 22 patients (partial response and failure) achieved a lasting complete response. Persistent partial response and failure resulted in progressive transitional cell carcinoma (stage T2 or greater, prostatic involvement and metastases) and only 1 of these survived for more than 5 years without cystectomy. None of our patients received bacillus Calmette-Guerin because it was not available during the time most of the patients were treated. While the lives and bladders in some patients may be spared by its use, failure to achieve a complete response indicates impending disaster and cystectomy should be considered seriously.\r"

Failure of this operation can be owing to persistent distal venous leakage consisting of venous shunts between the distal corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, which can be demonstrated by cavernosography. These shunts can be closed successfully by spongiosolysis, that is by dissecting the distal half of the corpus spongiosum and by isolating the tips of the corpora cavernosa. Of 5 patients who underwent spongiosolysis after previous ligation of the dorsal vein of the penis 4 regained erectile ability with the help of intracavernous injection of a vasoactive drug mixture (15 mg. per ml. papaverine hydrochloride plus 0.5 mg. per ml. phentolamine mesylate, 0.5 to 2 ml. per injection), which was necessary because of concomitant arterial lesions demonstrated by arteriography. The only failure proved to be persistent venous insufficiency of the deep dorsal vein of the penis. Since none of the patients had any serious complication spongiosolysis seems to be a safe procedure in the treatment of distal venous leakage.\r"

Of the patients treated with chemotherapy alone only 44 achieved a complete remission and 4 were salvaged with further therapy (1 chemotherapy and 3 radiation therapy). These 48 patients (92 per cent) remained free of disease at a followup of 30 to 471 weeks. Six prognostic factors were tested by univariate analysis (chi-square) and only the use of previous chemotherapy predicted for a lower complete remission rate (p equals 0.02). Renal toxicity (greater than 0.4 mg. per dl. increase in serum creatinine) occurred in 2 patients (4 per cent). Neurotoxicity occurred in 16 patients (31 per cent). No fatal toxicity occurred. Cyclophosphamide and weekly cisplatin were well tolerated in patients previously treated with radiation therapy and is the treatment of choice for patients with disseminated seminoma.\r"

  ".W": "The fate of 48 patients with clinical stage T3 prostatic carcinoma after attempted curative surgical management was studied. In 23 of these patients positive frozen sections of the lymph nodes were found at pelvic lymphadenectomy and orchiectomy was performed. The median interval to progression was 61 months. Radical prostatectomy was performed in the remaining 25 patients. In 4 of these patients positive lymph nodes were found on paraffin sections but no additional treatment was given. Over-all, total tumor removal as defined by negative lymph nodes and negative margins of resection could be achieved in 14 of the 48 patients (29 per cent). During the same period 34 patients with clinical state T less than 3 prostatic carcinoma were treated in a similar manner. Orchiectomy was done in 4 patients because of positive frozen sections of the lymph nodes and radical prostatectomy was done in 30, including 1 in whom positive paraffin sections of the lymph nodes were found but no additional treatment was given. An attempt was made to study the impact of several prognostic factors by comparing the probability of progression between patients with stage pT3 disease with (T3pT3N0) or without (T less than 3pT3N0) extracapsular tumor growth as determined by preoperative rectal examination (36 versus 27 per cent progression at 3 years), with or without positive margins of resection (45 versus 20 per cent progression at 3 years) and with or without involvement of the seminal vesicles (47 versus 18 per cent progression at 3 years). Our results suggest that a certain proportion of patients with clinical stage T3 disease will benefit from radical prostatectomy. This is to be expected especially in patients with stage T3pT3N0 cancer and negative margins.\r"

  ".U": "88011471\r", 
  ".W": "Delineation of the neurovascular bundles has made it possible to identify the branches of the pelvic plexus to the corpora cavernosa intraoperatively and to decide whether the bundles can be preserved or resected widely with the specimen. In the course of performing 312 radical retropubic prostatectomies the neurovascular bundle was widely excised unilaterally in 49 men with advanced clinical disease in whom, based on preoperative or intraoperative assessment, the bundle appeared to be involved by tumor. Because of this selection criterion these patients had higher clinical stage (52 per cent had clinical stage B2) and pathological stage (35 per cent had microscopic involvement of pelvic lymph nodes) disease than our previously reported series. In 38 patients the margins of resection were negative for tumor. In 11 patients despite attempts at wide excision of the lesion the surgical margins of resection were positive. In all 11 men with positive surgical margins there was extensive periprostatic extension of tumor and 8 had involvement of the pelvic lymph nodes. However, in none of the 11 patients with positive surgical margins were the margins positive only at the site where the bundle was spared, which shows that unilateral sparing of the neurovascular bundle did not compromise removal of tumor. Of the 29 men who were potent preoperatively and who have been followed for 1 year or longer postoperatively 20 (69 per cent) are potent. The return of sexual function correlated with age: 5 of 5 men (100 per cent) 40 to 49 years old were potent postoperatively compared to 8 of 10 (80 per cent) 50 to 59 years old and 7 of 14 (50 per cent) 60 to 69 years old. Histological evaluation of the resected specimens revealed that some of the men who were potent postoperatively had soft tissue and nerves resected in the region of the contralateral spared neurovascular bundle. By measuring nerves in the spared region of the neurovascular bundle we found that the role of the neurovascular bundles in potency is not owing to large nerves but to many nerves of varying size. In conclusion, potency can be maintained after radical prostatectomy in most patients in whom it is necessary to excise 1 neurovascular bundle widely without compromising the removal of tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Specimens of urethra were obtained from patients with cervical and thoracic spinal cord lesion with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and from patients with lower motor neurone lesion with detrusor areflexia, undergoing transurethral sphincterotomy. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in nerves associated with both the smooth and striated muscle components of the urethral sphincter were studied immunohistochemically and by immunoassay. In patients with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia following cervical and thoracic spinal cord injury, NPY- and VIP-immunoreactive varicose nerve fibres were seen in both the smooth and striated muscle components of the urethral sphincter. In the smooth muscle, NPY- and VIP-immunoreactive nerves did not appear to have any particular orientation, but in the striated muscle region they were found to run along the length of individual muscle fibres. In patients with detrusor areflexia following lower motor neurone lesion, while the pattern, density and fluorescence intensity of NPY- and VIP-immunoreactive nerves in the smooth muscle of the sphincter mechanism appeared the same as seen in patients with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, there was a marked increase in the density of these nerves in the striated muscle region of the sphincter mechanism. Quantitation of the peptides by immunoassay was consistent with the histochemical findings, with significantly higher levels of both NPY and VIP in the striated muscle of patients with lower motor neurone lesion, compared to those with cervical and thoracic spinal cord lesion, p = 0.04. NPY and VIP levels in urethral smooth muscle were in the same range in lower motor neurone lesion patients and cervical and thoracic spinal cord lesion patients. We conclude that there are increased NPY- and VIP-containing fibres in striated muscle of the intrinsic external urethral sphincter in patients with areflexic bladder compared with those with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.\r"

Rabbit bladders were irrigated antegrade via a ureterotomy for twenty hours. Tham E produced considerably more mucosal injury than did tham (p = 0.0001). The minimal advantage in rapidity of stone dissolution offered by tham E over tham is more than offset by the considerably increased potential for toxic side effects. The results suggest tham and not tham E should be used for irrigation to dissolve uric acid stones.\r"

The study was conducted with #18 french catheters fitted with a 30 ml. balloon since smaller size catheters frequently fell out spontaneously. The distinction between patients who were \"blockers\" and \"nonblockers\" was found to be clinically useful since \"nonblockers\", who constituted about half the population, did well regardless of type of catheter material used. Formation of encrustations and blockage was significantly less in \"blockers\" with silicone than with teflon-coated or latex catheters. The more rapid flow-time through silicone catheters appears to be related to a larger bore. Although this study supports the use of silicone catheters for \"blockers\" on long-term drainage the results should not be interpreted to imply that they are preferable to other types of catheters for short-term use or to changing less expensive catheters more frequently when needed.\r"

The synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and tropomyosin, were relatively constant throughout the course of prostatic regression. The rate of synthesis of androgen-dependent proteins declined rapidly from a high level of synthesis before castration to a non-detectable level by Day 3 postcastration. However, three proteins, which were either not synthesized (spot G and spot H) or synthesized at a very low level (spot I) before castration, were the major proteins synthesized by the prostate during early stages of its regression. The rate of synthesis of these proteins reached a peak by Day 4 postcastration, declined rapidly and remained at a low level thereafter. The respective molecular weights and isoelectric points for these three proteins were 33 Kd and 7.2 for spot G, 38 Kd and 5.3 for spot H and 64 Kd and 6.0 for spot I. Previous findings showed that prostatic regression in rats was associated with a surge of activities in proteolytic enzymes which peaked five to six days postcastration. The peak of synthesis of three proteins noted in the present study, therefore, preceded the peak of activities of proteolytic enzymes in the regressing prostate by one to two days. Testosterone replacement to animals at the time of castration prevented the synthesis of these proteins in the prostate. Since the synthesis of these three proteins in the ventral prostate is induced by androgen-depletion resulted from castration, they are considered as the castration-induced proteins.\r"

These factors have a high affinity for heparin sepharose and are eluted from the heparin-sepharose column, at 1.2 to 1.9 M NaCl. In normal prostates, the high affinity human prostatic growth factor occurred only in extremely small amounts. The high affinity growth factors stimulate DNA synthesis in 3T3, DU145, and LNCaP. Stimulation was significantly enhanced by 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 17 beta-estradiol in the androgen sensitive LNCaP cell line. SDS-PAGE and isoelectrofocusing confirmed that the partially purified factors had a molecular weight of 18 kDa and acidic isoelectric points of pH 3.6 and 4.7.\r"

Ileal, ileocecal, right colon and sigmoid segments were used in tubular and opened configurations. Our experience leads us to recommend opened ileal segment reconstruction in neurogenic bladder patients and those with weak anal sphincters generally, and open ileocecal or open right colon segments in patients with other etiologies. Continence was achieved in 53 patients, although secondary procedures, particularly at the bladder outlet, were required in 13. When ureteral reimplantation was required we achieved excellent success with normal-sized or mildly dilated ureters regardless of the operative technique used. Initial failures to prevent reflux in the face of marked ureterectasis using the ileocecal valve have been resolved by a modified technique of intussusception and fixation. An over-all favorable experience is reported, which we believe permits us to formulate certain rules that will improve the acceptability and success of bladder reconstruction in general.\r"

These studies were done to determine the choice of bowel segment to augment or replace the detrusor and the shape in which the bowel segment should be reconstructed. Eleven patients underwent tubular and 10 detubularized right colon cystoplasty, while 10 underwent tubular (Camey bladder) and 7 detubularized ileocystoplasty. Compliance curves were normal in nearly all patients except those who underwent tubular ileocystoplasty. Cystoplasty contractions were more common with tubular cystoplasty. These contractions appeared at a lower bladder capacity and were higher in amplitude in tubular cystoplasty patients. Detubularizing the bowel for bladder reconstruction appears to create a better low pressure capacitor with better compliance and fewer high pressure cystoplasty contractions.\r"

Gastrocystoplasty (4) or colocystoplasty (4) was constructed in 8 female mongrels. Acute intravenous saline and acid loading experiments were performed 2 to 4 weeks after cystoplasty. The mean solute excretion rates for sodium, chloride, phosphorus and ammonia exhibited opposite trends during acute saline and acid loading in this experimental model. The net flux of chloride, ammonia, phosphorus and sodium ions in the colocystoplasty animals was from the mucosa/urine surface to the serum (reabsorption). The opposite trend was true for the gastrocystoplasty. By not reabsorbing ammonium chloride, the gastrocystoplasty preserved an important renal mechanism for systemic acid elimination. This may help to prevent the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that can develop when urine comes in contact with small or large bowel segments.\r"

After preoperative urodynamic and clinical assessment, 10 children with neurogenic bladders underwent small bowel augmentation. Presenting clinical problems included incontinence and hydronephrosis. Urodynamic studies after small bowel augmentation demonstrated that bladder capacity increased an average of 184 per cent. Maximum intravesical pressures diminished considerably compared to preoperative values and no patient suffered significant uninhibited contractions. Nine children are totally dry and 1 has stress incontinence. Our initial findings demonstrate the efficacy of small bowel augmentation in the treatment of lower urinary tract neurogenic dysfunction owing primarily to alterations in detrusor function.\r"
