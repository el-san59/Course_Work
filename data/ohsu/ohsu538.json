  ".W": "We studied the effects of bronchoconstrictor stimuli administered selectively through isolated-perfused preparations of the bronchial and pulmonary circulations of 80 Sprague-Dawley rats. Dose-related contraction was elicited with infusion of acetylcholine (ACh), histamine, and serotonin (5-HT). Bolus infusion of 10(-5) mol ACh caused a 3.5-fold increase in pulmonary resistance (RL) after infusion into the pulmonary circulation (PC) and a 2.5-fold increase in the bronchial circulation (BC) (P less than 0.05 vs. control) that was blocked selectively in each circulation with atropine. Administration of 10(-5) mol 5-HT into the BC caused only a 45% increase in RL; the same dose of 5-HT caused a 5.1-fold increase in RL in the PC. A biphasic (increase at lower doses/decrease at higher doses) change in RL was elicited by histamine that was converted to dose-related constriction after H2-receptor blockade with cimetidine in both BC and PC. Response to exogenous ACh remained viable for greater than 5 h. Infusion of the mast cell degranulating agent, compound 48/80 (48/80), caused increase in RL that corresponded to quantitative recovery of histamine in the perfusates of both BC and PC. Histamine concentration in the perfusate increased from 47.2 +/- 31.8 (base line) to 624 +/- 60.1 ng/ml (2-fold increase in RL) in the BC and from 38.3 +/- 17.7 (base line) to 294.4 +/- 38.1 ng/ml (50% increase in RL) in the PC (P less than 0.001 vs. baseline concentration) after a 0.1-mg/ml dose of 48/80.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The right atrium, carotid artery, and femoral artery were cannulated, and the ductus arteriosus, aorta, and pulmonary artery ligated in neonatal baboons (Papio cynocephalus) under a combination of ketamine, diazepam, and pancuronium. The internal jugular vein was also cannulated retrograde to the level of the occipital ridge. We measured hemoglobin, pH, arterial and venous PO2 (both from the pump circuit and from the cerebral venous site), serum lactate and bicarbonate concentrations, and pump flow, and we calculated hemoglobin saturations, (DO2), O2 consumption (VO2), systemic O2 extraction, and cerebral O2 extraction. Six baboons were studied during each of two phases of the experiment. In the first, flow rates were varied sequentially from 200 to 50 ml.kg-1.min-1 with saturation maximized. In the second, flow was maintained at 200 ml.kg-1.min-1 and saturation was reduced sequentially from 100 to 38%. VO2 fell significantly below baseline at a flow rate of 50 ml.kg-1.min-1 and a DO2 of 8 +/- 2 (SE) ml.kg-1.min-1 in phase 1 and at DO2 of 12 +/- 5 in phase 2. Both systemic and cerebral O2 extraction rose significantly at a flow of 100 ml.kg-1.min-1 and DO2 of 17 +/- 4 ml.kg-1.min-1 in phase 1, whereas neither rose with decreasing DO2 in phase 2.

Before and after each exposure, pulmonary function and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were measured and symptoms were recorded. Ozone exposure was associated with a statistically significant decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1), percent FEV1 (FEV1%), and forced expired flow at 25-75% FVC (FEF25-75) in both normal and asthmatic subjects. However, comparing the response of asthmatic and normal subjects to ozone revealed a significantly greater percent decrease in FEV1, FEV1%, and FEF25-75 in the asthmatic subjects. The effect of ozone on FVC and symptom scores did not differ between the two groups. In both normal and asthmatic subjects, exposure to ozone was accompanied by a significant increase in bronchial responsiveness. We conclude that exposure to a high effective ozone dose produces 1) increased bronchial responsiveness in both normal and asthmatic subjects, 2) greater airways obstruction in asthmatic than in normal subjects, and 3) similar symptoms and changes in lung volumes in the two groups.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose was to characterize expiratory-related neural activities in eupnea and gasping. In decerebrate and vagotomized cats, activities were recorded from the phrenic nerve, spinal intercostal and abdominal nerves, and recurrent laryngeal nerve and its branches. Neural inspiration was defined by phrenic discharge. The spinal and laryngeal nerves discharged in inspiration, expiration, or during both phases. Gasping was induced by freezing the brain stem at the pontomedullary junction, exposure to asphyxia or anoxia, or ligation of the basilar artery and its branches. In gasping, peak phrenic activity typically increased as did inspiratory-related activities of laryngeal and spinal nerves. Expiratory activities were greatly reduced in gasping, with some activities being completely eliminated. Reductions of expiratory activity were more prominent for spinal than laryngeal nerves. Similar results were obtained in cats having intact vagi that were ventilated with a servo-respirator so that lung inflation paralleled phrenic activity. The concept that gasping differs fundamentally form other ventilatory patterns is discussed.\r"

The reduction in body temperature increased with pressure, up to 35 atm He, the maximum studied. Since the heat transfer of the He and Ne gas mixtures is different and both gases exert negligible anesthetic effects, the hydrostatic pressure most likely affects behavioral thermoregulation by affecting neuronal function.\r"

These regimens included no surgical repair with no immobilization and surgical repair with various periods of immobilization. The biomechanical, biochemical, and histological properties of the healing MCL were examined 6 and 12 wk postoperatively. At 6 wk, all healing MCLs had increased cellularity with decreased levels of total collagen and increased amounts of reducible Schiff base cross-links and type III collagen. Biomechanically, the varus-valgus (V-V) knee laxity was significantly increased, and no group achieved normal structural or mechanical properties. At 12 wk the histological appearance of the MCL became more normal but still had increased cellularity. Biochemically, the total collagen levels in experimental MCLs were not statistically different from the controls, but these MCLs still had high amounts of type III collagen and an even higher number of reducible cross-links. From knees in which the MCL was not treated, the V-V knee laxity and the ultimate loads of the femur-MCL-tibia complex achieved normal values. However, the stress-strain properties for these MCLs and those treated with repair and immobilization did not completely recover.\r"

Under low-PO2 perifusion, specific O2 consumption and heat production rates (MO2 and E, respectively) were flow-rate dependent. E values were all larger than those obtained on blood-perfused preparations at 28 degrees C. MO2 reached 0.47 mumol.min-1.g muscle-1 and E reached 4 mW/g. Normalized to 36 degrees C by means of activation energies determined from 30 and 36 degrees C measurements on nonperfused gracilis strips, these maxima correspond to three times the largest MO2 measured by other authors in blood-autoperfused gracilis. Increasing perifusion PO2 from 6.3 to 88 kPa sharply decreased MO2. These results confirm that MO2 of blood-perfused skeletal muscles in vitro (and a fortiori in vivo) is kept much below its maximum for a noncontracting organ; they also suggest that this maximum MO2 is not necessarily an effect of unphysiologically high PO2 in the tissue cells.\r"

  ".W": "Severe damage to the alveolar type I epithelial cell is a characteristic morphological feature of lung injury due to numerous cases. It is postulated that excess phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity might be responsible for these changes, as one of the naturally occurring products of this enzyme, lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) has been shown to cause selective injury to the type I pneumonocyte when it is instilled into the lower air spaces of the lung. To further investigate this potential mechanism of type I epithelial cell toxicity, we have measured the epithelial permeability-surface area product (PS) for [14C]sucrose as well as whole-lung lysoPC content at several times after instilling PLA2 (Naja naja venom) into either the air spaces or the perfusate of an isolated hamster lung preparation. As a molar percentage of total phospholipids, the normal hamster lung contains approximately 1.5% lysoPC, and this value is not affected by fluid filling of the air spaces or perfusion of the excised lung for periods up to 90 min. When 0.15 U/ml PLA2 is instilled into the air spaces, lung lysoPC content increases to approximately 2.5% and there are barely detectable increases in [14C]sucrose PS. With air space PLA2 concentrations of 0.30 U/ml, lysoPC content increases to between 4 and 5%, [14C]sucrose PS increases by greater than a factor of 10, and flooding of the alveolar spaces occur. Ultrastructural studies of similarly treated lungs show widespread but selective damage to the type I epithelial cells. These same biochemical and functional changes are not seen when the same concentrations of PLA2 are added to the lung perfusate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We determined whether a similar inhibitory effect operates in the airways of anesthetized guinea pigs in vivo with the use of Evans blue dye as a marker of plasma leakage. Stimulation of the vagus nerve significantly increased leakage of dye in trachea and main bronchi (by approximately 300 and 600%, respectively). Similar increases in leakage were seen in the presence of atropine and propranolol. Morphine (1-30 mg/kg iv) inhibited leakage in a dose-related manner with complete inhibition in the trachea at a dose of 30 mg/kg. The inhibition was blocked by the opioid receptor-antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg iv). Intravenous substance P significantly increased leakage but was not inhibited by morphine. We conclude that morphine inhibits neurogenic plasma leakage by presynaptic inhibition of release of neuropeptides from sensory nerve endings. If similar mechanisms are operative in human airways, inhibition of neurogenic plasma leakage by opioid drugs devoid of central effects may be of value in the therapy of asthma.\r"

Sound measurements were done during apnea at functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, and residual volume both with the lungs filled with air and with an 80% He-20% O2 (heliox) gas mixture. Three acoustic indexes were calculated from the output sound pulse: the peak-to-peak amplitude, the peak frequency, and the mid-power frequency. We found that the average values of all indexes tended to be greater in the upper than in the ipsilateral lower lung zones. In the upper zones, peak-to-peak amplitude was greater at total lung capacity and residual volume than at functional residual capacity. Replacing air with heliox did not change these results. These experiments, together with others performed during Mueller and Valsalva maneuvers, suggest that resonance of the chest cage is the predominant factor determining the transmission of sternal percussion sounds to the posterior chest wall. The transmission seems to be only minimally affected by the acoustic characteristics of the lung parenchyma.\r"

The output audio signals were recorded over the left and right upper and lower lung zones, posteriorly. Sound measurements were made during apnea at functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, and residual volume both after breathing air and an 80% He-20% O2 (heliox) gas mixture. We calculated the peak-to-peak amplitude, the peak frequency, and the midpower frequency of the output sound. We found no consistent variations in the values of these indexes due to lung volume or resident gas density. In all cases, the transmitted sound was most intense at the right upper zone. This could not be explained on the basis of technical factors but was probably the result of normal asymmetry of the mediastinal anatomy. These data suggest that sound introduced through the mouth of healthy individuals excites intrathoracic structures but is transmitted through the parenchyma in such a manner that it is not markedly affected by familiar physiological variables. This must be taken into account if objective acoustical tests of lung physiology are to be developed.\r"

After the exhaustive exercise bout, the blastogenic response to concanavalin A by spleen cells of untrained rats was extensively suppressed, whereas the response of the trained rats was only marginally suppressed. The suppressed immune competence of the untrained rats after the exhaustive exercise was associated with an increase in immune-suppressive activity of splenic lymphocytes. The macrophages of the untrained rats and of the control sedentary rats were slightly immune suppressive to normal spleen cells through a prostaglandin-dependent mechanism. The addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the blastogenesis cultures revealed that the spleen cells of untrained rats were unusually sensitive to the suppressive effects of PGE2. In contrast to the untrained rats, the marginal level of immune suppression in trained rats after the exhaustive exercise was associated with a lesser degree of lymphocyte-suppressive activity, an immune stimulatory activity by the splenic macrophages, and an insensitivity of the splenic lymphocytes to the suppressive effects of PGE2.\r"

Acoustic areas in a model constructed from a human nasal cast, in the nasal cavity of a cadaver and in 10 normal subjects and two patients with well-defined afflictions of the nasal cavity, were compared with similar areas obtained by computerized tomography (CT) scans, a specially developed water displacement method, and anterior rhinomanometry. We found a coefficient of variation of the areas of less than 2% by the acoustic method compared with 15% for the rhinomanometric measurements. Acoustic areas correlated highly to similar areas obtained by CT scanning (r = 0.94) and by water displacement (r = 0.96). In two patients the acoustic method accurately outlined, respectively, a tumor in the nose and a septum deviation. It is concluded that this method provides an accurate method for measuring the geometry of the nasal cavity. It is easy to perform and is potentially useful for investigation of physiological and pathological changes in the nose.\r"

The provocation doses of histamine, PGD2, and LTC4 required to produce a 12.5% decrease in baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, PD12.5) and to further this fall to 25% (PD25-12.5) were determined. On three subsequent occasions, subjects inhaled either the PD12.5 LTC4 plus vehicle or vehicle plus the PD25-12.5 of either histamine or PGD2, and FEV1 and maximal flow at 70% of vital capacity below total lung capacity after a forced partial expiratory maneuver (Vp30) followed for 45 min. From these results, predicted time-course curves for LTC4 with histamine and LTC4 with PGD2 were calculated. On two final occasions, airway caliber was followed for 45 min after inhalation of the PD12.5 LTC4 followed by the PD25-12.5 of either histamine or PGD2. During the first 9 min after LTC4-histamine and LTC4-PGD2, the decreases in airway caliber were greater than the calculated predicted response. This interaction, although small, was significant with LTC4-PGD2 for both FEV1 (P = 0.01) and Vp30 (P less than 0.05) and with LTC4-histamine for Vp30 (P less than 0.05) but not for FEV1 (P less than 0.05). We conclude that inhaled LTC4 interacts synergistically with histamine and PGD2 and that this effect, although small, may be a relevant interaction in asthma.\r"

The results indicate that supramaximal exercise alters the distribution of NH3 and lactate between plasma and RBC, thus changing the relations between plasma and whole-blood concentrations of these metabolites. The alteration of NH3 distribution may reflect changes in the pH gradient between plasma and RBCs.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of supranormal compared with normal hepatic glycogen levels on hepatic glucose production (Ra) during exercise was investigated in chronically catheterized rats. Supranormal hepatic glycogen levels were obtained by a 24-h fast-24-h refeeding regimen. During treadmill running for 35 min at a speed of 21 m/min, Ra and plasma glucose increased more (P less than 0.05) and liver glucogen breakdown was larger in fasted-refed compared with control rats, although the stimuli for Ra were higher in control rats, the plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose being lower (P less than 0.05) in control compared with fasted-refed rats. Also, plasma concentrations of glucagon and both catecholamines tended to be higher and muscle glycogenolysis lower in control compared with fasted-refed rats. Lipid metabolism was similar in the two groups. The results indicate that hepatic glycogenolysis during exercise is directly related to hepatic glycogen content. The smaller endocrine glycogenolytic signal in face of higher plasma glucose concentrations in fasted-refed compared with control rats is indicative of metabolic feedback control of glucose mobilization during exercise. However, the higher exercise-induced increase in Ra, plasma glucose, and liver glycogen breakdown in fasted-refed compared with control rats indicates that metabolic feedback mechanisms are not able to accurately match Ra to the metabolic needs of working muscles.\r"

Speculating that a reciprocal relationship between the timing of peak intramuscular and pulsatile arterial pressures should optimize blood flow through muscle and minimize cardiac load, we tested the hypothesis that heart rate becomes entrained with walking and running cadence at some locomotion speeds, by means of electrocardiography and an accelerometer to provide signals reflecting heart rate and cadence, respectively. In 18 of 25 subjects, 1:1 coupling of heart and step rates was present at one or more speeds on a motorized treadmill, generally at moderate to high exercise intensities. To determine how exercise specific this phenomenon is, and to refute the competing hypothesis that coupling is due to vertical accelerations of the heart during locomotion, we had 12 other subjects cycle on an electronically braked bicycle ergometer. Coupling was found between heart rate and pedaling frequency in 10 of them. Cardiac-locomotor coupling appears to be a normal physiological phenomenon, and its identification provides a fresh perspective from which to study endurance.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that adipose tissue lipolytic activity is increased in endurance-trained subjects. In women, adipose tissue is extensive and it was thought interesting to confirm that endurance training increases the capacity of female adipose tissue to mobilize lipids, and moreover to more fully understand the mechanisms involved. So, biopsies of fat were obtained from the periumbilical region of 13 trained female runners (T) and 17 sedentary women (S) and the in vitro response to catecholamines of the collagenase-isolated fat cells was studied. Glycerol release, chosen as adipocyte lipolysis indicator, was measured by bioluminescence for various epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. In both groups, these substances provoked an increase in lipolysis, but the response was significantly higher in T. In both groups, isoproterenol increased the lipolytic activity above basal concentrations at 10(-8) M and above. Lipolytic activity in T was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than the S control at 10(-7) M and above. Epinephrine plus propranolol decreased lipolysis in both groups, but at 10(-5) M, lipolytic activity was significantly lower in S than in T (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that in female subjects, endurance training increases the sensitivity of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue to the lipolytic action of catecholamines; this effect seems to be related both to a decreased efficiency of the alpha 2-adrenergic pathway and to an increased efficiency of the beta-adrenergic pathway. This latter effect seems to take place at a step beyond the receptor-adenylate cyclase system in the lipolytic cascade.\r"

Thirty-nine women [29 +/- 4 (SD) yr], performed submaximal and maximal exercise cycle ergometry during pregnancy (antepartum, AP, 26 +/- 3 wk of gestation) and postpartum (PP, 8 +/- 2 wk). Neither maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) nor maximal heart rate (HR) was different AP and PP (VO2 = 1.91 +/- 0.32 and 1.83 +/- 0.31 l/min; HR = 182 +/- 8 and 184 +/- 7 beats/min, P greater than 0.05 for both). Cardiac output (Q, acetylene rebreathing technique) averaged 2.2 to 2.8 l/min higher AP (P less than 0.01) at rest and at each exercise work load. Increases in both HR and stroke volume (SV) contributed to the elevated Q at the lower exercise work loads, whereas an increased SV was primarily responsible for the higher Q at higher levels. The slope of the Q vs. VO2 relationship was not different AP and PP (6.15 +/- 1.32 and 6.18 +/- 1.34 l/min Q/l/min VO2, P greater than 0.05). In contrast, the arteriovenous O2 difference (a-vO2 difference) was lower at each exercise work load AP, suggesting that the higher Q AP was distributed to nonexercising vascular beds. We conclude that Q is greater and a-vO2 difference is less at all levels of exercise in pregnant subjects than in the same women postpartum but that the coupling of the increase in Q to the increase in systemic O2 demand (VO2) is not different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One immersion was conducted at 1000 (AM) and one at 2200 (PM) so that diurnal variations could be evaluated. Fifty-four hours separated the immersions, which lasted up to 6 h; 9 days separated each air saturation dive. Blood was collected before and after immersion; urine was collected for 12 h before, during, and after immersion for a total of 24 h. Plasma volume decreased significantly and to the same extent (approximately 17%) during both AM and PM immersions. Urine flow increased by 236.1 +/- 38.7 and 296.3 +/- 52.0%, urinary excretion of Na increased by 290.4 +/- 89.0 and 329.5 +/- 77.0%, K by 245.0 +/- 73.4 and 215.5 +/- 44.6%, Ca by 211.0 +/- 31.4 and 241.1 +/- 50.4%, Mg by 201.4 +/- 45.9 and 165.3 +/- 287%, and Zn by 427.8 +/- 93.7 and 301.9 +/- 75.4% during AM and PM immersions, respectively, compared with preimmersion. Urine flow and K excretion were significantly higher during the AM than PM. In summary, when subjects are immersed in cold water for prolonged periods, combined with a slow rate of body cooling afforded by thermal protection and enforced intermittent exercise, there is diuresis, decreased plasma volume, and increased excretions of Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn.\r"

Mouse surfactant resolved in this way exists in three subtypes with similar phospholipid compositions. A \"light\" subtype of buoyant density 1.027 +/- 0.012 (SD) g/ml comprises 43 +/- 18% of the total alveolar lavage phospholipid, has little surface activity, and consists exclusively of small unilamellar vesicles. A \"heavy\" subtype of buoyant density 1.055 +/- 0.016 g/ml comprises 48 +/- 11% of the total, is surface active, and consists of small amounts of tubular myelin among large empty vesicles. A third component, called \"ultraheavy,\" comprises 9 +/- 4% of the total alveolar lavage phospholipid, has a density of 1.072 +/- 0.020 g/ml, is surface active, and consists of large aggregates of tubular myelin associated with lamellar bodylike structures. Labeling studies suggested that the ultraheavy material was labeled first and was of the same density as purified lamellar bodies. These results are consistent with the view that, in mice, surfactant is secreted into the alveolar compartment in an ultraheavy form, which evolves into the heavy and light forms.\r"

Volume displacements of the total chest wall surface, measured by summing the rib cage and abdominal signals, approximated measurements using volume-displacement, body plethysmography over the entire frequency range. Resistance (R) and elastance (E) of the diaphragm-abdomen pathway were several times greater than those of the rib cage pathway, except at the highest frequencies where diaphragm-abdominal E was small. R and E of the diaphragm-abdomen pathway and of the rib cage pathway showed the same frequency dependencies as that of the total chest wall: R decreased markedly as frequency increased, and E (especially in the diaphragm-abdomen) decreased at the highest frequencies. These results suggest that the chest wall can be reasonably modeled, over the frequency range studied, as a system with two major pathways for displacement. Each pathway seems to exhibit behavior that reflects nonlinear, rate-independent dissipation as well as viscoelastic properties. Impedances of these pathways are useful indexes of changes in chest wall mechanical behavior in different situations.\r"

  ".W": "We measured total chest wall impedance (Zw), \"pathway impedances\" of the rib cage (Zrcpath), and diaphragm-abdomen (Zd-apath), and impedance of the belly wall including abdominal contents (Zbw+) in five subjects during sustained expiratory (change in average pleural pressure [Ppl] from relaxation = 10 and 20 cmH2O) and inspiratory (change in Ppl = -10 and -20 cmH2O) muscle contraction, using forced oscillatory techniques (0.5-4 Hz) we have previously reported for relaxation (J. Appl. Physiol. 66: 350-359, 1989). Chest wall configuration and mean lung volume were kept constant. Zw, Zrcpath, Zd-apath, and Zbw+ all increased greatly at each frequency during expiratory muscle contraction; increases were proportional to effort. Zw, Zrcpath, and Zd-apath increased greatly during inspiratory muscle contraction, but Zbw+ did not. Resistances and elastances calculated from each of the impedances showed the same changes during muscle contraction as the corresponding impedances. Each of the resistances decreased as frequency increased, independent of effort; elastances generally increased with frequency. These frequency dependencies were similar to those measured in relaxed or tetanized isolated muscle during sinusoidal stretching (P.M. Rack, J. Physiol. Lond. 183: 1-14, 1966). We conclude that during respiratory muscle contraction 1) chest wall impedance increases, 2) changes in regional chest wall impedances can be somewhat independent, depending on which muscles contract, and 3) increases in chest wall impedance are due, at least in part, to changes in the passive properties of the muscles themselves.\r"

Animals given saline ran 116 +/- 9 (SE) min. At doses of 12.5 and 20 mg/kg, cocaine reduced endurance time significantly (34 and 74%, respectively). At rest the drug had no effect on liver or fast-twitch muscle glycogen but significantly reduced (20-40%) soleus glycogen at the two highest doses. However, at exhaustion, the quantity of glycogen depleted in the fast-twitch red and white vastus muscles was similar in all groups despite the reduced run times of the animals receiving a higher dose implying a greater rate of glycogenolysis due to cocaine. Blood lactate in the 20 mg/kg group (9.9 +/- 1.2 mM) at exhaustion was nearly twice that of the saline controls at exhaustion (5.1 +/- 0.6). Before exercise plasma norepinephrine (at doses of 2.5, 12.5 and 20 mg/kg) was higher than saline controls and remained higher (20 mg/kg groups) at exhaustion. We conclude that high doses of cocaine cause rapid muscle glycogen depletion and early fatigue. The mechanism by which cocaine causes these effects is not clear.\r"

Alveolar macrophages and neutrophils are probably directly involved in elastin degradation, but they may also indirectly influence elastin structure and function by altering other extracellular matrix components such as proteoglycans. In this study the mechanisms of proteoglycan degradation by human alveolar macrophages and neutrophils have been explored. Macrophages appear to utilize plasminogen in solubilizing 35SO4-labeled proteoglycans in extracellular matrix produced by neonatal rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Proteoglycan degradation by macrophages is significantly augmented in the presence of 1% human serum. In contrast, neutrophils apparently utilize intrinsic proteinases to solubilize extracellular matrix proteoglycans, and serum inhibits proteoglycan degradation by these cells. Persistent inflammation in the terminal airways of cigarette smokers may produce proteoglycan degradation and influence elastin fiber architecture where the earliest physiological and anatomic evidence of emphysema appears.\r"

Qualitative diagnostic calibration (QDC) is based on equations of the isovolume maneuver calibration (ISOCAL) and is carried out during a 5-min period of natural breathing without using mouthpiece or mask. In this situation, K approximates the ratio of standard deviations (SD) of the uncalibrated changes of AB-to-RC volume deflections. Validity of calibration was evaluated by 1) analyzing RIP waveforms during an isovolume maneuver and 2) comparing changes of tidal volume (VT) amplitude and functional residual capacity (FRC) level measured by spirometry (SP) with RIP values. Comparisons of VT(RIP) to VT(SP) were also obtained in a variety of postures during natural (uninstructed) preferential RC and AB breathing and with voluntary changes of VT amplitude and FRC level. VT(RIP)-to-VT(SP) comparisons were equal to or closer than published reports for single posture, ISOCAL, multiple- and linear-regression procedures. QDC of RIP in supine posture with comparisons to SP in that posture and others showed better accuracy in horizontal than upright postures.\r"

A hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), i.e., a hypoxia-induced increase in PAP over the entire range of Q studied, from 2 to 5 l.min-1.m-2, was elicited in all the animals. Surgical denervation of the carotid and aortic chemoreceptors in a first group of nine dogs increased PAP at the lowest Q of 2 and 3 l.min-1.min-2 in hyperoxia and increased PAP at all levels of Q in hypoxia, so that HPV was enhanced. Chemical sympathectomy in a second group of eight dogs increased PAP at all levels of Q to a comparable extent in hyperoxia and hypoxia so that HPV remained unchanged. Almitrine (8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 iv) in a third group of eight dogs increased PAP at all levels of Q in hyperoxia but had no effect on PAP/Q plots in hypoxia, so that HPV was inhibited. Almitrine had these same pulmonary vascular effects when administered to the chemodenervated and the sympathectomized dogs. Sham operation and a 2-h delay in a final group of five dogs had no effect on hyperoxic or hypoxic PAP/Q plots. We conclude that in intact dogs 1) the sympathetic nervous system reduces both hyperoxic and hypoxic pulmonary vascular tone, 2) stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors inhibits HPV, and 3) almitrine has direct pulmonary vasoconstricting effects in hyperoxia but not hypoxia.\r"

These responses occurred without altering factors that influence myocardial metabolism. Daily exercise significantly enhanced the coronary vascular sensitivity to each of the pharmacological agents. These results suggest that a nonspecific potentiation to pharmacological activation occurs after daily exercise. After left stellate ganglionectomy, intracoronary infusions of each pharmacological agent had similar effects on coronary blood flow velocity as presented for the intact dogs; however, daily exercise did not enhance the coronary vascular sensitivity to the pharmacological agents. These results demonstrate the need for an intact nervous system for the vascular adaptations associated with daily exercise.\r"

Static exercise, with its central volitional and skeletal muscle metabolic and mechanical afferent components, caused a rise in heart rate (HR, 32%), blood pressure (BP, 29%), and calf vascular resistance (calf R, 30%). During forearm occlusion after static exercise, HR returned to base line, the increase in BP was attenuated by 30%, and calf R remained elevated and unchanged. The percent change in calf R was correlated with forearm cellular pH (R = 0.56, P less than 0.001) but only weakly associated with PCr/Pi (R = 0.33, P less than 0.042). 30% MVC for 1 min followed by arterial occlusion (3 min) reduced PCr/Pi by 65% and pH by 0.16 U (P less than 0.05). Calf R was unchanged. Circulatory arrest alone (20 min) caused no change in either pH or calf R but large changes in PCr/Pi (50% reduction). We conclude that 1) there is an association between forearm cellular acidosis and calf vasconstriction during static forearm exercise and 2) large changes in PCr/Pi without concomitant changes in pH are not associated with changes in calf R.\r"

We compared the effects of phorbol esters known to activate protein kinase C, including phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDA), on monocyte adherence to bovine aortic EC. Human monocytes (purity 90 +/- 1% SE) were isolated by centrifugal elutriation to obtain monocytes not previously exposed to a surface. Kinetic studies revealed that 51Cr-labeled monocyte adherence to EC reached a plateau after a 45-min incubation. Concentrations of PMA between 10 and 1,000 ng/ml significantly decreased monocyte adherence to EC (26 +/- 10 and 35 +/- 8% decrease compared with control, respectively). Concentrations of PDA of 100 and 1,000 ng/ml had a similar inhibitory effect. In contrast, the chemotactic stimulus, zymosan-activated serum, significantly increased monocyte adherence (40 +/- 14% increase compared with control). Thus inflammatory stimuli have different effects on the adhesive interaction of monocytes to EC. This may provide a mechanism to selectively modulate monocyte egress from the circulation into extravascular inflammatory sites.\r"

To determine if cigarette smoke could alter endothelial permeability, we studied flux of radiolabeled albumin across monolayers of porcine pulmonary artery endothelium grown in culture on microporous membranes. Extracts (in either dimethylsulfoxide or phosphate-buffered saline) of cigarette smoke in a range estimate of concentrations simulating cigarette smoke exposure to the lungs in vivo caused a dose-dependent increase in albumin flux that was dependent on extracellular divalent cations and associated with polymerization of cellular actin. The effect was reversible, independent of the surface of endothelial cells exposed (either luminal or abluminal), and due primarily to components of the vapor phase of smoke. The effects occurred without evidence of cell damage, but subtle morphological changes were produced by exposure to the smoke extracts. These findings suggest that cigarette smoke can alter permeability of the lung endothelium through effects on cytoskeletal elements.\r"

This reduction, which was prevented by catalase, could not be explained by 1) changes in amino acid pools, 2) increased rate of degradation of newly synthesized proteins, 3) impaired poly(A)+ RNA synthesis and efficiency, 4) decreased rate of amino acylation. On the other hand, the increase in the monoribosome-to-polyribosome ratio suggested that translation was affected at the level of chain initiation. Further analysis indicated that 40S initiation complex formation was normal, whereas the assembly of 80S initiation complex was inhibited. Results from reconstitution experiments showed that both normal and treated ribosomes could support normal protein synthesis in the presence of normal initiation factors (IFs). In contrast, IFs from HX-XO lysates did not support normal protein synthesis with ribosomes from either source. Thus, the effect of XO treatment on protein synthesis appears to be an initiation defect related to decreased IF activity and/or availability.\r"

To determine what vascular segments were exposed to an LT-induced increase in intravascular hydrostatic pressure we measured pulmonary arterial (Ppa), pulmonary arterial occlusion (Po,a), venous (Po,v) and double occlusion (Pdo) pressures in isolated guinea pig lungs perfused with a cell-depleted buffered salt solution before and after injecting 4 micrograms of LTB4, LTC4, or LTD4 into the pulmonary artery. All three LTs increased airway pressures and also increased Ppa, Po,a, and Pdo. Histamine (15 micrograms) as well as serotonin (20 or 200 micrograms) had the same effect. In excised rabbit lungs, histamine and serotonin increased only Ppa, and Po,a. LTC4 had no vasoactivity. There are marked species variations with regard to the activity and site of action of histamine, serotonin, and LTC4 on the pulmonary circulation.\r"

Over a 10-wk period, the swimmers averaged 4,266 +/- 264 m/day swimming intermittent bouts of front crawl, kicking, or pulling. The training program induced an almost twofold increase in the mitochondrial marker enzyme citrate synthase. Po of the single fibers was not altered by either the training or 10-day intensive training programs, and no significant differences were observed in the Po (kg/cm2) of type I compared with the type II fibers. The type II fiber diameters were significantly larger than the type I fibers (94 +/- 4 vs. 80 +/- 2 microns), and although fiber diameters were unaffected by the training, the 10-day intensive training significantly reduced the type II fiber diameter. The type I fibers from the trained swimmers showed pCa-force curves shifted to the right such that higher free Ca2+ levels were required to elicit a given percent of Po (for values less than 0.5 Po). The activation threshold (pCa) for the onset of tension and the pCa required to elicit one-half maximal tension were not altered by the training in either fiber type. Fiber Vmax (measured by the slack test) was fivefold higher in type II compared with type I fibers (4.85 +/- 0.50 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.04 fiber lengths/s). The exercise-training program significantly increased and decreased the Vmax of the slow and fast fibers, respectively. The 10 days of intensified training produced a further significant decrease in the Vmax of the type II fibers. After a period of detraining, the Vmax of both fiber types returned to the control level. The force-velocity relation was not significantly altered in either fiber type by the swim training; however, the intensified training significantly depressed the velocity of the type II fiber at all loads studied. The Vmax changes with exercise training are likely explained by an exercise-induced expression of fast myosin in slow fibers and slow myosin in fast fibers.\r"

Total body water was estimated by tritiated water (TBWHTO) on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and then calculated from desiccation (TBWdes). TBWHTO was consistently larger than TBWdes for all groups. Differences were 10.9-16.9% on day 7 and 3.7-6.4% on day 28. On day 28, percent difference was higher in the slower-growing than the faster-growing groups. Nonaqueous hydrogen exchange was determined from tritium activity in the dried carcass. Less than 1% of the injected tritium exchanged with nonaqueous hydrogen during the equilibration period. Thus differences between TBWHTO and TBWdes in the younger animals could not be accounted for by nonaqueous hydrogen exchange but may have resulted from a larger loss of injected tritium, possibly in insensible water.\r"

The system uses two flowmeters in series to achieve a completely automatic flow calibration, and it uses breath-by-breath compensation for sample line transport delay. The accuracy of the system was measured over the range of VO2 and VCO2 from 100 to 800 ml/min by means of simulation. Accuracy was 0.54% for VO2 and 2.9% for VCO2. The system was further evaluated using two laboratory methods, the first method being comparison with a breath-by-breath system. As volunteers performed a maximum effort on a cycle ergometer, the mean difference in readings between the two systems was 17 ml/min for VO2 and 8.0 ml/min for VCO2. The correlation coefficient squared was greater than 0.96 for both. The second laboratory test was to use the system for 2 mo in a Human Performance Laboratory. Readings of maximum VO2 (VO2max) and anaerobic threshold were repeatable and consistent with the individual's activity level. The accuracy and convenience of operation will make this a valuable instrument aboard the Space Station.\r"

In four subjects, a primed continuous infusion protocol with L-[1-13C]leucine was used to determine whole-body leucine flux and oxidation. Whole-body protein synthesis was estimated from nonoxidative flux. Muscle protein synthesis rate was determined by measuring [13C]leucine incorporation into muscle samples obtained by needle biopsy. Testosterone increased muscle protein synthesis in all subjects (27% mean increase, P less than 0.05). Leucine oxidation decreased slightly (17% mean decrease, P less than 0.01), but whole-body protein synthesis did not change significantly. Muscle morphometry showed no significant increase in muscle fiber diameter. These studies suggest that testosterone increases muscle mass by increasing muscle protein synthesis.\r"

Although isoproterenol stimulated Cl- secretion, there was no effect of beta-adrenergic receptor activation on inositol phosphate accumulation. In contrast, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation but failed to induce Cl- secretion. Another Cl- secretagogue, prostaglandin E1, also failed to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation. These data suggest that inositol phosphate accumulation is neither sufficient nor required for stimulation of Cl- secretion in cultured canine tracheal epithelial cells.\r"

Immediately after the interruption of airflow, the mouth pressure suddenly increased (phase 1), followed by a slower rise in pressure (phase 2) within approximately 100 ms until the pressure reached the alveolar pressure. The pleural and alveolar pressures remained constant during this process. The first phase of the abrupt rise represented the pressure induced by the instantaneous interruption of the airflow itself. Analysis of the supramaximal flow (Vsupramax) observed after resumption of the airflow suggested that the choke point remained constant during the second phase of the mouth pressure after interruption of maximal flow (Vmax). From these results, examination of the second phase of the mouth pressure curve may provide useful information about the downstream segment of the airway.\r"

These effects are mediated primarily by an increase in central blood volume. Consequently, this redistribution and the resultant marked increase in cardiac output is associated with alterations in the circulating levels of several volume regulatory hormones, including plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone. Although the changes in these blood hormonal levels probably reflect perturbation of hormonal release, it is conceivable that the above-mentioned central hemodynamic modifications result in an altered splanchnic blood flow, thereby modulating hormonal clearances. We assessed the effects of immersion on hepatic blood flow by determining the pharmacokinetics of single doses of lidocaine administered intravenously. Seven normal male subjects were studied during a time-control period and during water immersion to the neck. The clearance of lidocaine was unaltered by immersion, suggesting that the presumed marked central hypervolemia and increased cardiac output was not associated with changes in splanchnic blood flow.\r"

These observations suggest that motor units may not be randomly distributed throughout the muscle but confined to localized subvolumes. In the present study, electromyographic (EMG) and glycogen depletion methods were combined to investigate the organization of motor units supplied by the primary branches of the phrenic nerve in the cat. Four primary branches are generally present, one branch to the crus and three branches to the sternocostal region. The gross motor-unit territory of each of the four phrenic primary branches was determined by stimulating each nerve separately, while recording from nine EMG electrodes distributed over the hemidiaphragm. Stimulation of the crural branch evoked activity in the ipsilateral crus, whereas stimulation of each of the remaining branches evoked activity in discrete but overlapping areas of the sternocostal diaphragm. A more precise analysis of the distribution and borders of the motor territories was obtained by mapping regions depleted of muscle glycogen due to stimulation of each primary branch for 90 min. Glycogen depletion results closely matched the EMG findings of a localized distribution of motor units served by single primary branches. Stimulation of the crural branch typically caused depletion of the ipsilateral crus, whereas the sternocostal branches each served a striplike compartment. In the majority of cases, the borders of the sternocostal compartments were relatively abrupt and consisted of a 1- to 2-mm transition zone of depleted and nondepleted fibers. These studies demonstrate that motor unit territories of the primary branches of the phrenic nerve are highly delineated. This compartmentalization provides the central nervous system with the potential for a more precise regional motor control of costal and crural diaphragm than previously suspected.\r"

Each subject was immersed three times over a 3-wk period. Each immersion followed 2.5 days of a specific dietary and/or exercise regimen designed to elicit low (L), normal (N), or high (H) glycogen levels in large skeletal muscle groups. Muscle glycogen concentration was determined in biopsies taken from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after each immersion. Intramuscular glycogen concentration before the immersion was significantly different among the L, N, and H trials (P less than 0.01), averaging 247 +/- 15, 406 +/- 23, and 548 +/- 42 (SE) mmol glucose units.kg dry muscle-1, respectively. The calculated metabolic heat production during the first 30 min of immersion was significantly lower during L compared with N or H (P less than 0.05). The rate at which Tre decreased was more rapid during the L immersion than either N or H (P less than 0.05), and the time during the immersion at which Tre first began to decrease also appeared sooner during L than N or H. The results suggest that low skeletal muscle glycogen levels are associated with more rapid body cooling during water immersion in humans. Higher than normal muscle glycogen levels, however, do not increase cold tolerance.\r"

Pulmonary vasoreactivity also varied with ages. Lungs at 0-4 days did not respond to hypoxia and responded poorly to prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). In contrast, lungs at 13-33 days had significant increases in delta Pm and the gradient across relatively indistensible arterial vessels during hypoxia and increases in all gradients with PGF2 alpha. Ventilation of fetal lungs reduced PVR, mainly because of a 50% reduction in delta Pm. Our results demonstrate that the magnitude and distribution of PVR relative to compliance varied as a function of perinatal age and that pulmonary vasoreactivity depended on postnatal age. The major effect of ventilating fetal lungs was on the middle region.\r"

Total work decreased from 20.5 +/- 0.7 kJ in bout 1 to 16.1 +/- 0.7 and 13.2 +/- 0.6 kJ in bouts 2 and 3. Glycogenolysis was 47.2 and 15.1 mmol glucosyl U/kg dry muscle during bouts 2 and 3, respectively. Lower accumulations of pathway intermediates in bout 3 confirmed a reduced glycolytic flux. In bout 3, the work done represented 82% of the work in bout 2, whereas glycogenolysis was only 32% of that in bout 2. Decreases in ATP and phosphocreatine contents were similar in the two bouts. Muscle [H+] increased from 195 +/- 12 to 274 +/- 19 nmol/l during bout 2, recovered to 226 +/- 8 nmol/l before bout 3, and increased to 315 +/- 24 nmol/l during bout 3. Muscle [H+] could not be predicted from lactate content, suggesting that ion fluxes are important in [H+] regulation in this exercise model. Low glycogenolysis in bout 3 may be due to an inhibitory effect of increased [H+] on glycogen phosphorylase activity. Alternately, reduced Ca2+ activation of fast-twitch fibers (including a possible H+ effect) may contribute to the low overall glycogenolysis. Total work in bout 3 is maintained by a greater reliance on slow-twitch fibers and oxidative metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that efferent sympathetic neural discharge is coupled with the development of muscle fatigue during voluntary exercise in humans. In 12 healthy subjects (aged 20-34 yr) we measured heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (AP), and noncontracting, skeletal muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in the leg (peroneal nerve) before (control) and during each of three trials of submaximal (30% of maximum) isometric handgrip exercise performed to exhaustion. In six of the subjects of eletromyographic (EMG) activity of the exercising forearm was also measured. HR and AP increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in the 1st min of exercise in all trials. In contrast, neither MSNA nor EMG activity increased significantly above control during the 1st min of exercise, but both parameters subsequently increased in a progressive and parallel manner (P less than 0.05). The overall correlation coefficient between MSNA and EMG activity (144 observations) was 0.85 (P less than 0.001). With successive trials the magnitudes of the increases in HR, AP, MSNA, and EMG activity were greater at any absolute point in time during exercise. These results indicate that sympathetic activation to noncontracting skeletal muscle is directly related to the development of muscle fatigue (as assessed by the change in EMG) during prolonged isometric exercise in humans. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that previous fatiguing contractions alter the time course of the sympathetic neural adjustments to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "At least two investigators have demonstrated a reduction in O2 extraction during induced hypothermia (Cain and Bradley, J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 1713-1717, 1983; Schumacker et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 63: 1246-1252, 1987). We hypothesized that administration of pentoxiphylline (PTX), a theobromine that lowers blood viscosity and has vasodilator effects, would increase O2 extraction during hypothermia. To test this hypothesis, we studied O2 transport in anesthetized, paralyzed, mechanically ventilated beagles exposed to hypoxic hypoxia during either 1) normothermia (38 degrees C), 2) hypothermia (30 degrees C), or 3) hypothermia + PTX (30 degrees C and PTX, 20 mg.kg-1.h-1). Measurements included arterial and mixed venous PO2, hemoglobin concentration and saturation, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), blood viscosity, and O2 consumption (VO2). Critical levels of O2 delivery (DO2, the product of arterial O2 content and cardiac output) were determined by a system of linear regression. Hypothermia significantly decreased base line cardiac output (-35%), DO2 (-37%), and VO2 (-45%), while increasing SVR and blood viscosity. Addition of PTX increased cardiac output (35%) and VO2 (14%), and returned SVR and blood viscosity to normothermic levels. Hypothermia alone failed to significantly reduce the critical level of DO2, but addition of PTX did [normothermia, 11.4 +/- 4.2 (SD) ml.kg-1.min-1; hypothermia, 9.3 +/- 3.6; hypothermia + PTX, 6.6 +/- 1.3; P less than 0.05, analysis of variance]. The O2 extraction ratio (VO2/DO2) at the critical level of DO2 was decreased during hypothermia alone (normothermia, 0.60 +/- 0.13; hypothermia, 0.42 +/- 0.16; hypothermia + PTX, 0.62 +/- 0.19; P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Open fractures were internally fixed primarily, and both comminuted and open fractures routinely had bone-grafting. Ninety-eight per cent of the fractures united, and 92 per cent of the patients achieved an excellent or satisfactory functional result. The rate of infection was 2.3 per cent. Refracture occurred after removal of a 4.5-millimeter dynamic-compression plate in two patients, but there were no refractures after removal of a 3.5-millimeter plate. The 3.5-millimeter-plate system gave excellent results in patients who had a fracture of the forearm, and it minimized the risk of refracture. Our results demonstrated that immediate plate fixation of an open fracture of the forearm, with a low rate of complications, is possible.\r"

No significant differences were found between the control and the spinal cord-injured group with regard to the cross-sectional area of the spinal canal; however, the differences between the two groups were significant with regard to mean sagittal and transverse diameters of the spinal canal. The sagittal diameters of the spinal canal of the control group were significantly larger than those of the spinal cord-injured group. Conversely, the transverse diameters of the spinal canal of the spinal cord-injured group were significantly larger than those of the control group. These findings suggest that certain patients may be predisposed to spinal cord injury, given sufficient trauma. It is not the total volume of space in the spinal canal that is the critical factor; rather, it is the shape. An index of shape is the ratio of the sagittal to the transverse diameter. The difference between the two groups, based on the ratio of sagittal to transverse diameter, was highly significant. Because this measure is a ratio, there is no need to evaluate an individual on the basis of measurements of absolute values.\r"

In five of the patients, the subluxation caused impairment of cranial nerves. One patient was tetraparetic. Six patients had a posterior fusion of the spine; of these, three also had laminectomy of the atlas. Operative treatment seemed to arrest the subluxation, but there was appreciable functional improvement in only four of the six patients. During an average of four years of follow-up, in the twelve conservatively treated patients, the cranial subluxation of the odontoid process progressed, on average, from 8.6 to 10.5 millimeters.\r"

The sixteen patients in Group I, who had less severe symptoms, were treated with a physical therapy program that was based on exercises to strengthen muscles. The eleven patients in Group II (three of whom had no success with physical therapy when they were originally in Group I) had a posterior capsulorrhaphy, with or without a bone block. According to an over-all rating, Group I had a rate of success of 63 per cent, and Group II had a rate of success of 91 per cent. The patients who had more severe ligamentous laxity were not more likely to fail either of the treatment programs. Although voluntary subluxation may be a subtle but important indicator of underlying emotional difficulties, it appears that, in the patient who is emotionally stable, the ability to voluntarily subluxate the shoulder posteriorly is not associated with a negative prognosis for either non-surgical or surgical treatment. Patients who have moderately disabling posterior subluxation of the shoulder should be treated with an intensive program that is designed to strengthen muscles. Patients who have symptoms that are severely disabling or who have had no success with non-operative treatment should be treated with posterior capsulorrhaphy. When the posterior aspect of the glenoid is severely deficient and when the posterior portion of the capsule or the infraspinatus tendon is attenuated, a bone block should augment the reconstruction.\r"

The average length of follow-up was 7.2 years (range, four to twelve years). Pronation, supination, and flexion of the elbow improved considerably, but extension did not change a great deal. The average rating of the elbow, according to the scoring system of Ewald et al., improved from 30 to 88 points, but the functional score, as defined by the American Rheumatism Association, improved in only four patients. Malarticulation or dislocation of the prosthesis occurred in ten patients (29 per cent). In two other patients, a deep infection developed, necessitating removal of the prosthesis. Ten prostheses (ten patients) had radiolucent lines on follow-up radiographs, but these lines were not associated with pain or loosening. Seven patients (seven elbows) had a transient ulnar-nerve palsy. The incidence of this complication was reduced from 30 per cent (five of seventeen patients) to 15 per cent (four of twenty-eight patients) when the lateral Kocher approach to the elbow was adopted.\r"

Preoperatively, all wrists were painful, with 96 per cent being moderately or severely so. Carpal subluxation was present in 79 per cent of the wrists. Postoperatively, pain recurred in 84 per cent of the wrists, but it was less severe (mild in 48 per cent, moderate in 35 per cent, and severe in 2 per cent). Sixty-eight per cent of the wrists fused spontaneously and were no longer painful. Of the twenty wrists (32 per cent) that did not fuse, 70 per cent were mildly or moderately painful. In patients who have rheumatoid arthritis, we found that palmar shelf arthroplasty was followed by a high rate of delayed spontaneous fusion and an unacceptably high rate of recurrent pain, although the pain was less severe.\r"

This was probably due to shortening of the patellar ligament after prolonged immobilization in a cast, interstitial scarring of the patellar ligament, and new-bone formation in the area of insertion of the patellar ligament. There was no correlation between the postoperative height of the patella and the need for subsequent revision to a total knee replacement.\r"

Alumina-ceramic implants were used as a control. A sixteen-millimeter segment of the middle of the shaft of the tibia was resected at a point distal to the junction of the tibia and the fibula. The defect was replaced by a fifteen-millimeter-long hollow, cylindrical implant that was fixed by intramedullary nailing using a Kirschner wire. Two groups of eight rabbits each (one group with a glass-ceramic implant and the other with an alumina implant) were killed twelve weeks after implantation. Two similar groups were killed twenty-five weeks after implantation. The segment of the tibia that contained the implant was excised and tension-tested. The load to failure of glass-ceramic implants containing apatite and wollastonite increased with time. The loads to failure of the glass-ceramic and alumina implants at twelve weeks after implantation were 19.8 +/- 7.06 and zero newtons, respectively. The loads to failure of glass-ceramic and alumina implants at twenty-five weeks after implantation were 126.4 +/- 32.54 and 19.6 +/- 13.92 newtons, respectively. No glass-ceramic implants broke. A calcium-phosphorus layer at the interface of the glass-ceramic and the bone was observed by scanning electron microscopy and electron-probe microanalysis. There was no interposition of soft tissue between the glass-ceramic and the bone, as observed by Giemsa surface staining.\r"

The ipsilateral foot was retained in six extremities that had a severe Type-1 or Type-2 deficiency. Medial transfer of the fibula (the Brown procedure) generally yielded less than satisfactory results; in ten of fourteen extremities, one or more additional operations were needed. Seventeen extremities were classified as having a Type-3 or Type-4 deficiency; Syme amputation was done in nine and Chopart amputation, in four. Despite satisfactory reconstruction of the ankle, a Syme amputation was necessary in most extremities that had a Type-4 deficiency because a major leg-length discrepancy was projected.

  ".W": "BIM 23014 (BIM) is a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analog. We studied the effects of this analog on the secretion of GH, TSH, and gastroenteropancreatic hormones [secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP)] in normal men. In the first protocol three BIM doses (125, 250, and 500 micrograms) and vehicle were administered sc in random order at 2000 h to eight normal young men. Plasma GH concentrations decreased during the first part of the night only after the highest dose (P less than 0.05). Plasma secretin levels did not change, while plasma motilin decreased after the 250- and 500-micrograms doses (P = 0.05 and P = 0.02, respectively), and plasma PP decreased after all three doses (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01, and P less than 0.01, respectively) during the first part of the night. In the second protocol, eight men received BIM, administered by constant sc infusion during the night in a dose of 2 mg/12 h, or vehicle, either alone or in association with a 10 ng/kg.min iv GHRH or vehicle infusion. Nocturnal GH secretion was suppressed by the BIM infusion (P less than 0.001). GH secretion, stimulated by GHRH infusion (P less than 0.001), was reduced by concomitant BIM infusion (P less than 0.001) and was pulsatile during the combined infusions. BIM infusion suppressed the physiological nighttime rise in plasma TSH levels. Plasma motilin and PP levels were reduced by BIM, when administered either alone or in combination with GHRH. We conclude that: 1) BIM is capable of reducing GH secretion when administered sc in a dose of 500 micrograms and of abolishing nocturnal GH secretion when constantly infused at a dose of 2 mg/12 h; 2) BIM, constantly infused, reduces the nocturnal rise in TSH secretion; and 3) motilin and PP secretion are more sensitive than that of GH to BIM, as they are reduced by a lower dose.\r"

The RU 486 concentrations in myometrium were similar in the five women studied, with a mean of 148 +/- 58 (+/- SD) ng/g (344 +/- 135 pmol/g). The adipose tissue RU 486 levels varied more, the mean concentration being 447 +/- 191 ng/g (1041 +/- 445 pmol/g). The serum RU 486 concentrations ranged from 175-899 ng/ml [mean, 396 +/- 259 ng/mL (922 +/- 603 nmol/L)]. In these women the nonprotein-bound fraction of [6,7-3H]RU 486 varied from 1.4-3.1% (mean, 2.3%). The approximate concentrations of the combined mono- and didemethylated metabolites of RU 486 were 1.4, 3.1, and 5.2 times higher in adipose tissue, myometrial tissue, and serum, respectively, than those of the parent RU 486. In vitro, rapid and nonsaturable accumulation of [6,7-3H]RU 486 from phosphate buffer into adipose tissue was inhibited by the addition of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, the specific serum transport protein for RU 486, to the buffer medium. Accumulation of [6,7-3H]RU 486 in myometrial specimens was poor. The enterohepatic cycling of RU 486 was assessed in four normal subjects by repetitive intake of charcoal subsequent to ingestion of 200 mg RU 486. Compared to other normal subjects, the serum levels and areas under the concentration curves were lower and t1/2 values shorter in the group given charcoal, suggesting that in vivo RU 486 may be partly pooled in the enterohepatic cycle. Our studies suggest that despite the low volume of distribution and the effective serum binding of RU 486, the myometrial and adipose tissue concentrations of RU 486 and its metabolites were similar (approximately 10(-9)-10(-10) mol/g) after oral intake of RU 486.\r"

  ".W": "We measured plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-casomorphin-8, a product of beta-casein hydrolysis which has opioid activity, by RIA in women during late pregnancy and lactation and in nonpregnant nonpuerperal women. Before RIA, the samples were acidified and extracted by reverse phase silica gel chromatography, which removed most of the beta-casein. Lactating women had a significantly higher mean plasma beta-casomorphin-8 concentration (2.66 nmol/L; n = 8) than women in late pregnancy (0.82 nmol/L; n = 8) and nonpregnant women (0.32 nmol/L; n = 5). The CSF beta-casomorphin-8 concentration also was significantly higher in lactating women (mean, 0.35 nmol/L; n = 8) than during late pregnancy (0.22 nmol/L; n = 8) or in nonpregnant women (0.15 nmol/L; n = 5). A positive correlation was found between plasma and CSF beta-casomorphin-8 levels in the entire study group. The milk beta-casomorphin-8 concentration, measured in five puerperal women, averaged 19.8 nmol/L. Thus, there is a decreasing concentration gradient between milk and plasma and between plasma and CSF. Chromatographic analysis revealed mol wt heterogeneity of the RIA-active material. In CSF at least three different components were detected, two of mol wt around 900-2,000 and one of approximately 12,000. One of the low mol wt components coeluted in several chromatographic systems with synthetic beta-casomorphin-8 (mol wt, 900). Such a component was not found in milk or plasma, in which the major activity was due to larger sized peptides. The major peaks in milk were around 1,500-2,000 and 12,000 mol wt, corresponding to the larger peaks in CSF. The results suggest that fragments of the milk protein beta-casein may cross the breast parenchyma-blood barrier into plasma and subsequently penetrate the blood-brain barrier to reach the central nervous system. Thus, mammary tissue may assume endocrine function during galactopoiesis, and beta-casein could be considered a prohormone.\r"

NT-like immunoreactivities in plasma were quantitated using 2 sequence-specific RIAs and gel filtration chromatography. During iv infusion of NT-(1-13) in 6 normal subjects, the median t1/2 was 1.7 min (interquartile range, 0.7-2.8), the MCR was 36 mL/kg.min (range, 21-54), and distribution space was 78.8 mL/kg (range, 56-91). The results were similar at infusion rates of 72, 144, and 288 pmol/kg.h (n = 6). During infusion of NT-(1-8) in 7 normal subjects, the median t1/2 was 8.3 min (range, 4.7-13.8), the MCR was 11.0 mL/kg.min (range, 6.7-21.7), and the distribution space was 142.6 mL/kg (range, 45.3-281.0). Significant peripheral arteriovenous extraction of NT-(1-13) was found at infusion rates of 144 and 288 pmol/kg.h. Extraction of NH2-terminal immunoreactivity was not significant. Intact NT was identified by gel chromatography in arterial plasma after lipid ingestion and iv infusion of NT-(1-13), but postprandially in only low concentrations. In 17 patients with various nonhepatic diseases, plasma intact NT levels were not different in blood sampled from the renal vein, inferior vena cava, brachial artery, or hepatic vein. In contrast, NH2-terminal immunoreactivity was significantly higher in hepatic venous than in systemic plasma. In 6 patients with hepatic disease, systemic plasma intact NT levels were increased, but even more so in hepatic venous plasma. These results demonstrate that metabolism of intact NT is rapid, and a significant peripheral arterio-venous extraction is present. Further studies are necessary to establish if the liver is a site of degradation of intact NT in man.\r"

The functional importance of lithium-sodium (Li-Na) countertransport in regulating sodium (Na) transport in vascular smooth muscle and kidney by Na-H countertransport and the potential effect of thyroid hormone on these processes led us to study Li-Na countertransport and other sodium transporters in RBCs of patients with thyroid dysfunction. Patients with untreated hypothyroidism (10) and hyperthyroidism (10) were studied, along with normal subjects (10). The mean value for Li-Na countertransport was significantly higher in the hypothyroid group [0.46 +/- 0.08 (+/- SE) mmol/L cell.h; P less than 0.05] and lower in the hyperthyroid group (0.15 +/- 0.04 mmol/L cell.h; P less than 0.05) compared to that in the normal subjects (0.25 +/- 0.03 mmol/L cell.h). When all groups were combined, significant negative correlations were found between Li-Na countertransport and serum T4 (r = -0.48; P less than 0.01), free T4 index (r = -0.42; P less than 0.05), and serum T3 (r = -0.38; P less than 0.05). Li-Na countertransport was positively correlated with serum triglyceride (r = 0.57; P less than 0.01), but not with serum cholesterol levels (r = 0.28; P = NS). The values became normal in subsets of the hypothyroid (n = 5) and hyperthyroid groups (n = 5) during treatment. We found a bidirectional effect of thyroid status on RBC Li-Na countertransport, which was reversible when serum thyroid hormone levels became normal. Changes in Li-Na countertransport, a pathway of Na-H exchange, may influence renal sodium handling and vascular tone in patients with thyroid disease and contribute to abnormalities such as hypertension that occur in patients with hypothyroidism.\r"

We treated 26 hyperprolactinemic women with this compound given as a single bedtime (hs) dose for up to 12 weeks. All had gonadal dysfunction, either amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, and 15 had galactorrhea. The initial and subsequent doses were administered in a randomized fashion; the initial dose ranged from 0.01-0.05 mg, and the dose at 12 weeks ranged from 0.03-0.09 mg. The women were evaluated every 2 weeks, and the dose was increased by 0.02 mg every 4 weeks if the serum PRL level was greater than 20 micrograms/L. Of the 26 women initially enrolled, 24 completed 12 weeks of therapy, and 2 discontinued therapy because of side-effects. Thirteen women (54%) had return of menses, and 12 (80%) had either a decrease in or disappearance of galactorrhea. Serum PRL concentrations decreased to a variable degree in all patients; 13 (54%) achieved a normal serum PRL level (less than or equal to 20 micrograms/L). The mean (+/- SE) pretreatment serum PRL concentration was 129 +/- 34, and it was 29.9 +/- 5.9 micrograms/L after 12 weeks of treatment (P = 0.005). The mean (+/- SE) percent reduction in serum PRL was 66.5 +/- 5.0% (median, 78.0%). A dose response was not demonstrated (r = -0.08; P = 0.70) among the 6 dose groups during the last 4 weeks of therapy. In 5 women, serum PRL levels, measured frequently for 24 h after treatment remained low. Side-effects after the initiation of therapy included nausea, headache, and morning fatigue in 10 women. These symptoms caused 2 women to discontinue therapy; they subsided in the other women. An optimal dose was not determined and will probably need to be determined by titration in each patient. CV 205-502, given once daily, appears to be a safe and effective alternative to other dopamine agonists in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia.\r"

AC activity was monitored by the conversion of [alpha-32P]ATP into [32P]cAMP under basal conditions and in the presence of several activators: NaF (10 mmol/L) plus forskolin (100 mumol/L); hCG (10 micrograms/mL); guanyl 5'-yl-imidodiphosphate [GMP-P(NH)P; 100 mumol/L]; and hCG (10 micrograms/ml) plus GMP-P(NH)P (100 mumol/L). The groups of human CL were midluteal (n = 10), late luteal (n = 4), following cycle (old CL; n = 5), and early pregnancy (6-11 weeks; n = 10). The groups of monkey CL were early luteal (n = 4), midluteal (n = 5), and pregnancy at term (n = 3). Luteal AC activity changed significantly during the menstrual cycle. In newly (less than 48 h after ovulation) formed CL, the enzyme was unresponsive to hCG, and total AC activity, as determined by NaF plus forskolin, averaged 86.5 +/- 28.9 (+/- SE) pmol cAMP/min.mg protein. As the CL developed, AC activity increased. Thus, in the midluteal phase, maximal hCG responsiveness in the presence of guanine nucleotide was 125 +/- 27 and 232 +/- 15 pmol/min.mg in human and monkey CL, respectively. No hCG responsiveness was detected in the late luteal phase or in the old CL. Maximal AC activity was also high in the midluteal phase (382 +/- 56 and 256 +/- 28 pmol/min.mg in human and monkey CL, respectively); the activity remained fairly high during the late luteal phase and then declined to less than 100 pmol/min.mg in the follicular phase of the next cycle. During early pregnancy, luteal AC was unresponsive to hCG stimulation, yet basal levels, maximal activity, and the characteristics of stimulation by nonhormonal activators were similar, if not identical, to those at the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. At term pregnancy, the enzyme remained unresponsive to hCG. However, basal activity and stimulation by NaF and forskolin were remarkably elevated, being between 2- and 7-fold higher than corresponding stimulations in the midluteal phase. We conclude that 1) AC activity in human luteal membranes is highly dependent on hormonal changes and functional state of the ovary, 2) the activity of luteal AC is similar in the CL of humans and cynomolgus monkeys, and 3) the AC system in the primate CL is functionally active during and at the end of pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we investigated whether this inhibitory effect on GH secretion persists during chronic pirenzepine administration, and if pirenzepine administration affects glycemic control. Nocturnal GH secretion was studied from 2300-0800 h before and after one month of pirenzepine administration (100 mg/day, orally, given at 2300 h) in 13 diabetic patients receiving their usual insulin treatment. GH secretion (GH area under curve) was blunted after pirenzepine administration [mean, 877 +/- 215 (+/- SE) vs. 1407 +/- 311 micrograms/L.min; P less than 0.002]. During pirenzepine administration, hemoglobin A1c significantly decreased (P less than 0.02), and 4 of the 13 patients had lower daily insulin requirements (5-23 U/day), but there was no significant change for the group as a whole. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of pirenzepine on GH secretion persists when pirenzepine is given chronically and that pirenzepine seems to improve the metabolic control of the patients.\r"

At entry into the study 18 women had amenorrhea, 8 had oligomenorrhea, and 4 had regular menstrual periods. The initial mean serum PRL levels did not differ in women grouped according to menstrual function. Nine women (35%) had improvement in clinical symptoms. Serum PRL decreased, and menstrual periods normalized more often in those who initially had oligomenorrhea or regular menstrual periods. In most amenorrheic women serum PRL levels did not decline, and menstrual symptoms did not improve. Six of 30 women had an increase in serum PRL, 14 had no change, and 10 had a decrease, in 6 of whom serum PRL was normal at the last observation. Twenty-seven women had serial radiographic studies. Four (15%) of the 13 women with initially abnormal radiographic findings had normal studies later, 2 had tumor progression, and 7 no change. Four of 14 women who had normal radiographic studies initially developed radiographic evidence of a pituitary tumor, although the radiographic changes were minimal, and no patient developed a macroadenoma or pituitary hypofunction. Increases or decreases in serum PRL did not accurately predict changes in tumor size. Prior estrogen use and previous pregnancies did not increase the likelihood of tumor appearance or enhance tumor growth. The clinical presentation of the patient was an important factor in predicting which patients had a decline in serum PRL and resolution of symptoms. We conclude that patients with hyperprolactinemia are unlikely to have progression of their disease and may, in fact, have clinical and radiographic improvement.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect of chronic clonidine administration on 24-h integrated GH secretion (IC-GH) in eight children (six boys and two girls; age, 6.0-13.0 yr) with constitutional growth delay (CGD). Clonidine was given orally in a daily dose of 0.1 mg/m2 at bedtime for 6 months; 24-h secretion studies were performed before and after 2 months of treatment. Clonidine caused a significant augmentation (P less than 0.02) of mean IC-GH from 2.6 +/- 0.4 (+/- SE) to 4.6 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L. The increase in IC-GH was mainly the result of increased GH pulse amplitude, which rose from 12.3 +/- 1.3 to 18.2 +/- 2.1 micrograms/L (P less than 0.01). The mean GH pulse amplitude was significantly higher (P less than 0.02) during sleep (15.9 +/- 2.4 micrograms/L) than during the awake hours (8.4 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L) before treatment. During clonidine treatment the mean GH pulse amplitude during the awake hours (15.0 +/- 3.8 micrograms/L) was similar to that during sleep (20.3 +/- 3.1 micrograms/L). GH pulse frequency was not altered by treatment during either the awake or sleep hours. The mean insulin-like growth factor I levels after 2 (1400 +/- 300 U/L) and 6 (1760 +/- 430 U/L) months of treatment were significantly higher (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.05, respectively) than the pretreatment value (920 +/- 240 U/L). After 2 months of clonidine treatment, growth velocity increased from 3.1 +/- 0.5 to 10.2 +/- 1.0 cm/yr (P less than 0.001), and after 6 months of treatment is was still significantly higher (7.0 +/- 0.7 cm/yr; P less than 0.02) than that before treatment. These results confirm the ability of clonidine to accelerate growth in children with CGD and indicate that clonidine is capable of increasing IC-GH levels. They also reinforce the view that many children with CGD have decreased endogenous GH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The aims of this study were to 1) evaluate the relative contributions of hypothalamic and ovarian oxytocin (OT) to peripheral serum concentrations and 2) determine the relationship between serum OT and ovarian steroid concentrations. Four groups of women were studied: 1) women with spontaneous cycles (n = 4) and normal serum estradiol (E2), progesterone, LH, and FSH levels; 2) in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients (n = 8) undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation; 3) agonadal oocyte-recipient patients (n = 6) receiving replacement E2 and P therapy; and 4) postmenopausal women (n = 21). Peripheral serum samples were collected daily during a menstrual cycle from the normal and agonadal women and for 6 days before ovulation in the IVF group. Serum immunoreactive OT was measured by specific RIA after Sep-Pak extraction; the assay sensitivity was 0.6 pmol/L. Serum OT in the women with normal cycles increased during the follicular phase, reaching a peak 1 day after the LH surge, and decreased in the luteal phase [days 7, 16, and 21, 10.7 +/- 3.5 (mean +/- SE), 25.7 +/- 5.7, and 13.2 +/- 2.5 pmol/L, respectively; P less than 0.05]. Serum OT levels were higher in IVF patients before ovulation than in women with spontaneous cycles, but lower than those in the agonadal women, who had a peak value (49.1 +/- 9.6 pmol/L; P less than 0.05) on day 13 of E2/progesterone replacement therapy. Serum OT was positively correlated (r = 0.68, normal women; r = 0.91, oocyte recipients) with serum E2 values during the first part of the cycle (P less than 0.01). A similar positive correlation between serum OT and E2 was found in the postmenopausal women (r = 0.83). We conclude that serum OT before and around the time of ovulation comes mainly from the pituitary, and not from the ovary, and is E2 dependent.\r"

  ".W": "The quantitation of human GH in a serum sample is not consistent among various commercially available immunoassays. We measured serum GH concentrations with four RIAs [Cambridge, Kallestad, National Hormone and Pituitary Program, and Radioassay Systems Laboratories (RSL)] and two immunoradiometric assays (IRMAs; Hybritech and Nichols). Serum GH concentrations measured by the RIAs were between 1.9 and 2.8 times higher than those determined by the Hybritech IRMA, whereas the concentrations measured by the Nichols IRMA were approximately 3.0 times higher than the Hybritech values. We evaluated the effects of differences in standards, assay diluents, and antibody specificity on GH measurement in the various assays. When GH standards from each of the assays were measured in the Hybritech IRMA, only the RSL standard was less immunoreactive than the other assay standards. Different assay diluents also resulted in varying GH values. In the RIAs, GH diluted in serum was more immunoreactive than GH diluted in phosphate-buffered saline-0.5% BSA. This enhanced immunoreactivity appeared to be due to a nonspecific effect generated by serum. The Nichols and Hybritech IRMAs provide standards diluted in horse serum. In the Nichols assay, GH diluted in human serum was more immunoreactive than GH diluted in horse serum, whereas the immunoreactivity of GH diluted in either serum was equal in the Hybritech IRMA. These IRMAs also differ in that the Nichols assay detected the 20K variant of GH, whereas the Hybritech assay did not. Considering these discrepancies, comparison of data obtained using different assays should be made carefully.\r"

  ".U": "89139760\r", 
  ".W": "Studies in six Arab individuals from Gaza with familial male pseudohermaphroditism (MPH) due to 17-ketoreductase deficiency revealed several metabolic aberrations associated with the disorder. Plasma LH, FSH, testosterone, and androstenedione concentrations were low in the two prepubertal patients. After hCG administration plasma androstenedione increased markedly. The four postpubertal MPH patients had very high plasma gonadotropin and androstenedione concentrations, the latter increasing further after hCG administration. Plasma testosterone concentrations in all six patients were moderately low or normal for age and increased little after hCG administration. Spermatic venous testosterone concentrations, measured in three adults, were within the normal range in two and low in one, while androstenedione concentrations were markedly elevated (15- to 32-fold) in all three patients. Kinetic analyses of progesterone and androstenedione metabolism were performed in testicular tissue of these patients and compared to the results in two control subjects. While testicular tissue from the two prepubertal patients metabolized progesterone only to androstenedione, and that to a limited extent, the tissue from the four postpubertal patients metabolized progesterone to 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxyprogesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone and metabolized androstenedione to testosterone. The Michaelis constants of these reactions were similar in the tissue from the MPH and the control subjects. The production of 16 alpha- plus 16 beta-hydroxyprogesterone was 5.4- to 10.3-fold greater, and 17-hydroxylase activity was 5.8- to 8.1-fold lower in the testes of the postpubertal MPH patients compared to values in the control subjects. The preference of androstenedione production through the delta 4- or delta 5-pathways was examined in the testes of two adult MPH patients using an equimolar concentration of [14C]progesterone and [3H]pregnenolone as substrates. While the flow of substrates in the control testes was equal or slightly greater through the delta 4-pathway, the delta 5-pathway predominated in the testes of the MPH patients. A large amount of dehydroepiandrosterone accumulated when NAD, the cofactor for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase, was omitted, supporting the contention that androstenedione was produced in the testes of the MPH patients mainly through the delta 5-pathway. Additional support for this suggestion was the finding that the 3H/14C ratio in androstenedione and testosterone produced from both substrates was 8 times higher in the testes from MPH patients than in those from the control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found no [125I]hCG binding in any of the corpora albicantia. Scatchard plot analysis for each CL revealed a linear binding plot indicative of a single set of LH/hCG receptors. The mean concentration of unoccupied receptors was 36 +/- 10 (+/- SE) fmol/mg protein in the early luteal phase (days 15-19; n = 5), 64 +/- 11 fmol/mg protein in the midluteal phase (days 20-25; n = 13), and 42 +/- 19 fmol/mg protein in the late luteal phase (days 26-30; n = 5). The concentrations of occupied receptors were 56 +/- 8, 46 +/- 6, and 54 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein in the early, mid-, and late luteal phases, respectively. Total (occupied plus unoccupied) receptor concentrations reached maximum levels of 110 +/- 11 fmol/mg protein in the midluteal phase. Ka increased progressively from 12 +/- 4 X 10(9) mol/L-1 in the early luteal phase to 19 +/- 7 X 10(9) and 21 +/- 8 X 10(9) mol/L-1 in the mid- and late luteal phases. We conclude that in normal CL, 1) total and unoccupied LH/hCG receptor levels parallel progesterone secretion; 2) changes in the binding affinity may be important in sustaining and/or rescuing the CL; and 3) loss of LH/hCG receptors is probably related to luteolysis.\r"

All patients had a history of obstetric shock or massive bleeding, and were receiving cortisol and/or L-T4 replacement therapy. None had any symptoms of diabetes insipidus. The mean basal plasma vasopressin level in the patients [0.6 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) pmol/L] was significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than that in normal adults (2.5 +/- 0.5 pmol/L; n = 12), whereas mean plasma osmolality values were similar in the two groups. During hypertonic saline infusion, the 10 hypopituitary patients had varying degrees of subnormal arginine vasopressin responses to the increase in plasma osmolality. Urine-concentrating ability after dehydration also was lower in the patients, although overt polyuria was absent at the time of this study. These results indicate that the osmoregulation of arginine vasopressin secretion is frequently impaired in postpartum hypopituitarism, suggesting neurohypophyseal damage.\r"

  ".W": "A 46,XY infant with perineoscrotal hypospadias and microphallus was identified in a family in which seven individuals have severe hypospadias that is inherited in a pattern compatible with an X-linked defect. The infant had small testes that were palpable in the labioscrotal folds, the proximal urethra was male in character, and there was no vagina. Serum testosterone rose from 0.5 to 5.1 nmol/L in response to hCG, and there was a negligible clinical response to a short term course of testosterone enanthate. A clinical diagnosis of male pseudohermaphroditism due to androgen resistance was made. Studies in cultured genital skin fibroblasts disclosed normal 5 alpha-reductase activity, a normal amount of high affinity dihydrotestosterone binding, and normal up-regulation of androgen receptors when monolayers were incubated with dihydrotestosterone or mibolerone. Fibroblast cytosol preparations contained a normal 7-8S sedimenting peak of androgen binding. However, androgen binding in monolayers decreased 60% when the assay temperature was raised from 30 to 41 C, and the dissociation rate of ligand from the receptor was enhanced 5-fold compared to the control value, establishing the diagnosis of androgen resistance due to a qualitative abnormality of the androgen receptor. Because of parental decision to raise the patient as a male, he was given two courses of high dose testosterone cypionate when he was 2.5 and 3.5 yr old (100 mg every 2 weeks for six doses). This treatment produced significant phallic growth, making it possible to undertake surgical correction of the hypospadias. We postulate that the impairment of androgen receptor function was overcome in part by the large dose of androgen.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has been found in the kidney, but its precise cellular localization is not known. Since there is evidence that IGF-I is an autocrine factor in many tissues and since murine mesangial cells have IGF-I receptors, we examined whether human mesangial cells produce IGF-I. Culture medium conditioned by mesangial cells was concentrated by reverse phase chromatography and applied to a Sephadex G-100 column equilibrated in a denaturing buffer. Two major species with apparent mol wt (MW) of 7,500 and 25,000 daltons were identified by IGF-I RIA. To determine whether the high MW species possessed IGF-I binding activity, appropriate fractions were desalted, incubated with [125I]Thr59-IGF-I for 2 h at 30 C, and applied to a Sephadex G-100 column equilibrated in a nondissociating buffer. The major peak of radioactivity was confined to a high MW region; there was no radioactivity in the fractions corresponding to 7,500 daltons. Further characterization of 7,500 dalton IGF-I immunoreactive species by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography showed that it coeluted with synthetic human IGF-I. Isoelectric focusing revealed it to have a pI between 8.1 and 8.5, corresponding to the pI of human IGF-I of 8.25. Northern blot analyses of poly(A)+ RNA from human mesangial cells and human liver using a cDNA probe for human IGF-I showed that a 2.0-kilobase transcript predominated in the mesangial cells, whereas the liver contained 1.1- and 2.0-kilobase species. Specific binding of IGF-I to mesangial cells was demonstrated, and competition curves indicated a rank order of potency (IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin) consistent with type I IGF receptors. We conclude that human mesangial cells 1) express IGF-I mRNA transcripts, 2) secrete IGF-I and IGF-I-binding activity, and 3) possess specific IGF-I receptors. These data suggest that IGF-I may act as an autocrine or paracrine factor that regulates glomerular cell functions.\r"

Sephadex G-50 gel filtration of tissue extracts revealed two immunoreactive peaks, the first in the void volume of the column, and the second in the elution volume of authentic IGF-I. The first peak was identified as IGF-I-binding protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after cross-linking with iodinated IGF-I. Isolated thyroid cell membranes contained high affinity IGF-I-binding sites of similar affinity and numbers in both normal and nodular thyroid tissue. The IGF-I content of six thyroid cancer extracts was higher than that of normal thyroid tissue, but the IGF-I content of thyroid tissue from six patients with Graves' disease and five patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis was similar to that in normal thyroid tissue. These data suggest that the stimulatory effect of TSH on thyroid cell proliferation could be mediated through IGF-I action and suggest that an increase in IGF-I production could sustain the goitrogenic process.\r"

Peripheral and ovarian venous blood samples were obtained from 34 nonpregnant women, 13 during the luteal phase and 21 during the follicular phase of their cycles, and from a 6-week pregnant woman. Plasma relaxin, oxytocin, and progesterone concentrations were determined by sensitive and specific RIAs. Plasma relaxin levels were not detectable (less than 0.16 microgram/L) in peripheral or ovarian venous plasma not draining a corpus luteum. The mean relaxin concentration in plasma draining an ovary with a corpus luteum was 0.41 +/- 0.09 (+/- SE) microgram/L. Oxytocin levels also were significantly higher in plasma draining an ovary with a corpus luteum (6.70 +/- 1.86 pmol/L) than in that draining the ovary with no corpus luteum (1.58 +/- 0.09 pmol/L; P less than 0.01) or in peripheral plasma (1.58 +/- 0.09 pmol/L; P less than 0.025). The mean progesterone concentration also was highest in plasma draining an ovary with a corpus luteum (210.2 +/- 50.5 nmol/L) compared with those in plasma from the contralateral ovarian vein (40.3 +/- 16.5 nmol/L P less than 0.005) and peripheral plasma (30.2 +/- 5.7 nmol/L; P less than 0.005) during the luteal phase. In a woman who was 6 weeks pregnant, plasma draining the ovary with a corpus luteum had 1.9 micrograms relaxin/L, but only 0.49 pmol/L oxytocin; the latter was similar to concentrations in noncorpus luteum-bearing ovarian venous plasma. These findings indicate that the human corpus luteum secretes relaxin, oxytocin, and progesterone. Both ovarian oxytocin and relaxin may function as paracrine or autocrine modulators of luteal function.\r"

Ten milligrams of CMI led to significant increases in plasma PRL and cortisol concentrations; plasma ACTH increased slightly but not significantly. In contrast, plasma GH, melatonin, and norepinephrine concentrations did not increase. Plasma PRL, ACTH, and cortisol levels increased significantly after 20 mg CMI; again, there were no significant changes in plasma GH, melatonin, or norepinephrine concentrations. All subjects tolerated the 10-mg dose well, but the 20-mg dose caused nausea in three of six subjects. Desmethylclomipramine, a metabolite that inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine, was not detectable in plasma after either CMI dose. These results support the hypothesis that serotonin is involved in the regulation of PRL, cortisol, and ACTH in humans.\r"

Several investigators have reported increases in serum immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) values after a few weeks or months of lithium treatment, and several cases of primary hyperparathyroidism developing during lithium treatment have been reported. To determine whether the increases in serum iPTH might be the result of increased renal retention of inactive PTH fragments rather than stimulation of parathyroid function, we measured plasma intact PTH by immunoradiometric assay and estimated parathyroid size by ultrasonography in men who had received short term (less than 6 months) or long term (greater than 3 yr) lithium treatment and in normal subjects. Serum ionized calcium was higher by 0.03-0.04 mmol/L in subjects treated short term (mean, 1.7 months) with lithium than in normal subjects, but plasma intact PTH and serum midregion iPTH values were not different. The absence of a reciprocal decrease in PTH values is compatible with a lithium-induced shift in the set-point for the inhibition of PTH secretion by calcium toward a higher calcium value. Both plasma intact PTH and serum midregion PTH values were higher in subjects during longer term (mean, 103 months) lithium treatment, and estimated parathyroid volume was 3-fold higher. Serum phosphate was lower, and serum chloride and plasma 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D values were higher in those treated with lithium long term, probably from the biological action of the increased PTH. We conclude that long term lithium treatment increases circulating biologically active PTH and causes parathyroid enlargement. Whether this chronic stimulus to parathyroid growth might lead to adenoma formation in certain susceptible individuals and whether a PTH-induced increase in skeletal remodelling occurs that might hasten the appearance of osteopenia remain to be determined.\r"

Interest in this concept has been increased because of the recent availability of nasal calcitonin for the management of osteoporosis. Plasma calcitonin and albumin-adjusted calcium levels were measured in 30 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and 41 normal women matched for age and sex. Both mean plasma calcitonin and mean albumin-adjusted calcium levels were higher in the postmenopausal osteoporotic women [calcitonin, 21.0 +/- 17.6 (+/- SD) vs. 9.8 +/- 10.2 ng/L (P = 0.003); calcium, 2.33 +/- 0.09 vs. 2.27 +/- 0.07 mmol/L (P = 0.002)]. This result indicates that fasting calcitonin deficiency is not a feature of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

  ".W": "We estimated the prevalence of persons with histologic dysplasia in at least one of two nevi examined by biopsy to be 53% in Utah's caucasians. This apparently high prevalence indicates that such lesions may represent a normal variant of a melanocytic nevus, perhaps those in the process of active proliferation. Regardless of the apparent ubiquity of these lesions, examination of biopsy specimens led to a grading scheme of histologic dysplasia that may reflect chronologic stages in the neoplastic development of melanocytic nevi. Comparison of these histologic findings with the clinical examination yielded the unexpected result that dysplasia and lesion size are independent of each other. Lesions 3 mm in diameter or smaller were as likely to be dysplastic as those much larger. There was, however, a statistically significant relationship between histologic dysplasia of a nevus examined by biopsy and the person's total number of melanocytic lesions. This finding indicates that the pathology grading scheme may be useful. The high prevalence of dysplastic nevi dilutes the clinical significance of a dysplastic nevus as an isolated finding and thereby lessens the importance of pathologic findings in the diagnosis of dysplastic nervus syndrome.\r"

Two patients had Hodgkin's disease and follicular mucinosis; both were younger than 20 years of age. Seven other patients were 20 years of age or younger. Two of the nine adolescent patients had persistent plaques of follicular mucinosis up to 18 years after diagnosis. Evaluation of biopsy specimens for lymphocytes, eosinophils, nonlymphoid cell infiltration, epidermal lymphocytic exocytosis, mucin deposition, and epidermal hyperplasia revealed no predominant feature that differentiated the group with benign disease from the group with mycosis fungoides. We conclude that no single clinical or histopathologic observation predicts which patients with follicular mucinosis will have a benign course and that evaluation of multiple clinical and histologic variables is necessary.\r"

When the test strip is taped on the skin, perspiration hydrates the film and transforms it to a gel, which causes the allergen to be released. The first panel of 12 allergens and allergen mixes is standardized and tested for stability in vitro and in vivo. The accuracy of the test panel has been certified in international multicenter studies by comparing it with present patch test techniques. A second panel of 11 more allergens was completed in 1988. The two test panels include the full standard panel of the North American Contact Dermatitis Group.\r"

Many clinical patterns occurred, including eight cases of inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus. A variety of other cutaneous abnormalities were found. Biopsies were performed in 41 cases. Three patients developed secondary tumors. One hundred nineteen of the patients were assessed for the presence of abnormalities in other organ systems. One or more abnormalities were demonstrated in 33% of patients, and in 5%, five or more abnormalities were detected. This study indicates that patients with epidermal nevi are at significant risk of having other abnormalities and warrant detailed initial assessment and close follow-up.\r"

In the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) Registry, 19,946 patients were analyzed to characterize baseline clinical, hemodynamic and angiographic features of patients dying from sudden cardiac death and to compare them with features of patients dying from other cardiac causes, of those dying from noncardiac causes and of survivors. Of the 11,843 medically treated patients, 1,621 died during a mean follow-up period of 5.0 years: death was sudden in 557 (34%), nonsudden but cardiac in 813 (50%) and noncardiac in 251 (16%). In 8,103 surgically treated patients, 824 deaths occurred during a mean follow-up period of 5.1 years: death was sudden in 204 (25%), nonsudden but cardiac in 390 (47%) and noncardiac in 230 (28%). In general, the patients (both medically and surgically treated) who died of cardiac causes, either suddenly or nonsuddenly, were similar to each other but significantly different from patients who either survived or died of noncardiac causes. Although patients with an increased risk of any type of cardiac death could be identified, there were no measures of angiographic or hemodynamic characteristics that were significantly different between patients with sudden cardiac death and those with nonsudden cardiac death. Identification of patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death will require approaches in addition to clinical, angiographic and hemodynamic assessment, such as electrophysiologic assessment or monitoring techniques to identify triggering mechanisms.\r"

From the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Multicenter Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS), detailed coding of coronary angiograms was available in 24,959 patients. Of these patients, 73 (0.3%) had major coronary artery anomalies: 70 had one coronary anomaly and 3 had two coronary anomalies. The most common anomaly involved the circumflex coronary artery (60%). In 69% of these, the circumflex artery arose from a separate ostium in the right coronary sinus, and in 31% it originated as a branch of the right coronary artery. The most common anomalous course was anterior or posterior to the great vessels but not between the great vessels. The major exception to this finding was an anomalous right coronary artery; 7 of 15 such arteries coursed between the great vessels. Anomalous circumflex coronary arteries had a significantly greater degree of stenosis than that in nonanomalous arteries in age- and gender-matched control patients (p = 0.02). Despite this difference, at 7 years there was no significant difference in survival by location or degree of stenosis in the anomalous artery.\r"

Twenty patients had atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia, whereas 34 had orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Supraventricular tachycardia was terminated in 24 (86%) of 28 patients given intravenous diltiazem compared with 5 (19%) of 26 given placebo (p = 0.0000014). Nineteen (95%) of 20 patients initially given placebo had termination of supraventricular tachycardia after receiving diltiazem. Overall, 43 (90%) of 48 patients receiving intravenous diltiazem had conversion of supraventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm; the median time to tachycardia termination was 2 min after initiation of a 2 min diltiazem infusion. All 20 patients (100%) with AV node reentrant tachycardia treated with diltiazem had conversion of tachycardia to sinus rhythm as did 26 (81%) of 30 patients with AV reciprocating tachycardia treated with diltiazem. Diltiazem prolonged refractoriness and slowed conduction of the AV node and thereby provided antiarrhythmic action to cause tachycardia termination. Diltiazem had no effect on the electrophysiologic properties of accessory AV connections. Adverse effects were seen in 3 (6%) of the 48 patients given diltiazem. For paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia initiated in the electrophysiology laboratory, it is concluded that intravenous diltiazem is safe and very effective for acute tachycardia termination when the AV node is part of the reentrant circuit.\r"

First, the reproducibility of repeat recordings (mean interval 28 +/- 36 days) of aortic jet velocity, made by two independent observers, was tested in 38 adults with aortic stenosis and unchanged clinical status. The two recordings of maximal velocity correlated well (r = 0.96, y = 0.88x + 0.46m/s, SEE = 0.21 m/s) with a mean coefficient of variation of 3.2%. Repeat recording of left ventricular outflow tract velocity by two independent observers in 10 other patients with aortic stenosis also correlated well (r = 0.94, y = 1.06x + 0.0 m/s, SEE = 0.06 m/s) with a mean coefficient of variation of 4.6%. Next, Doppler echocardiography was used to study 42 patients with aortic stenosis (mean age 66 years) over a follow-up interval of 6 to 43 months (mean 20). Maximal aortic jet velocity increased by 0.36 m/s per year (range -0.3 to +1.0 m/s per year). Mean transaortic pressure gradient changed by -7 to +23 (mean 8) mm Hg/year. Aortic valve area by the continuity equation (n = 25) decreased by 0 to 0.5 cm2/year (mean decrease 0.1 cm2/year). Some patients had a worsening of stenosis (decrease in valve area) even though they had no change or a decrease in pressure gradient, because of concurrent decreases in transaortic volume flow. Twenty-one patients (50%) developed new or progressive symptoms of aortic stenosis necessitating valve replacement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether two-dimensional echocardiography can identify patients with left ventricular thrombus after myocardial infarction who are prone to embolism, clinical and echocardiographic variables in 541 patients with a first infarction between 1979 and 1983 were studied prospectively. The first echocardiogram showed definite thrombus in 115 patients (Group 1, 21%) and no thrombus in 426 (Group 2, control). In Group 1, 27 patients (23%) had clinical evidence of systemic embolism related to the thrombus before referral (Group 1a) and 88 did not (Group 1b); these two groups were similar in age, gender and infarct location, but more Group 1a patients were within 1 month of the acute infarction. In both Groups 1a and 1b, the thrombus was found in apical views over asynergic zones, with no difference (p greater than 0.05) between the two groups in the size (average area from two views being 5.3 versus 4.5 cm2), type (protruding in apical views 30% versus 27%), location (apical 83% versus 86%; septal 11% versus 11%; posterior 4% versus 2%), extent of asynergy (31% versus 33%) and ejection fraction (33% versus 34%). However, the frequency of anticoagulant therapy was less (26% versus 63%, p less than 0.005), adjacent hyperkinesia greater (100% versus 49%, p less than 0.005) and thrombus mobility greater (81% versus 19%, p less than 0.005) in Group 1a than in Group 1b. Serial echocardiograms revealed a decreased size of the thrombus by 6 months in both Groups 1a and 1b, and little or no trace in 85% by 24 months. Thus, ventricular thrombus size, location and protrusion in apical views on echocardiography did not correlate with embolism. In contrast, thrombus mobility, the presence of adjacent hyperkinesia and thrombus protrusion assessed in multiple views appeared to be strong discriminators of thrombus prone to embolism. These echocardiographic features might provide a guide for the duration of anticoagulant therapy.\r"

To determine whether subgroups of mildly symptomatic patients with one or two vessel coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction have an increased risk of death or cardiac events during medical therapy, 53 consecutive patients with angiographically defined one or two vessel disease and impaired left ventricular function (ejection fraction 20% to 40%) were studied by exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and rest and exercise radionuclide angiography. All but two patients had previous myocardial infarction, and all were asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic during medical therapy. By univariate life table analysis, mortality during medical therapy was associated significantly with the ST segment response to exercise (p less than 0.05) and with both the exercise ejection fraction (p less than 0.05) and the magnitude of change in ejection fraction with exercise (p less than 0.005). In patients with an exercise ejection fraction greater than 30%, the probability of survival at 6 years was 97 +/- 3% (+/- SE) compared with a survival rate of 62 +/- 14% in the remaining subjects (p less than 0.005). Similarly, 6 year survival was 100% in patients whose ejection fraction increased from the value at rest but was only 74 +/- 10% in the remaining patients (p less than 0.005).

Alternatively, this disease may represent the coincidence of a common disease, hypertension, with a relatively rare cardiomyopathy. A consecutive series of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertension were studied and compared with age- and gender-matched patients with cardiomyopathy alone. Thirty-nine patients were identified as having hypertension; they ranged in age from 31 to 84 years (average 60 +/- 13); 82% were greater than 50 years old; 18 (46%) were women. When these patients were compared with the age-matched group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy alone, there were no clinical or electrocardiographic differences between the two groups. By echocardiography, the hypertensive and nonhypertensive groups had a similar incidence of systolic anterior motion (77 versus 64%, respectively), mitral annular calcification (31 versus 31%), septal thickness greater than 20 mm (56 versus 46%) and outflow tract gradient greater than 20 mm (59 versus 67%). A posterior wall thickness greater than 13 mm was more frequent in the hypertensive group (54%) compared with the nonhypertensive group (31%) (p = 0.02). The findings show that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with associated hypertension is a disease of the elderly. But, with the exception of thicker walls, the clinical and echocardiographic features of the patients with hypertension were indistinguishable from those of the age-matched and, hence, elderly group of patients with cardiomyopathy without hypertension. These findings suggest that hypertension may make hypertrophy worse, but that it is not the primary cause of the cardiomyopathy. Thus, the condition might be better termed \"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with hypertension.\"\r"

Doppler color flow imaging was performed in 47 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and left ventriculography. The jet area was measured as the largest clearly definable flow disturbance in the parasternal and apical views, and expressed as the maximal jet area, the mean of the largest jet area (average jet area) in two views or as the ratio of these measures to left atrial area. Correlation of all Doppler color flow measurements with angiographic grades of mitral regurgitation were comparable, maximal jet area being closest at r = 0.76. A maximal jet area greater than 8 cm2 predicted severe mitral regurgitation with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 94%, whereas a maximal jet area less than 4 cm2 predicted mild mitral regurgitation with a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 75%, respectively. All patients with an average jet area greater than 8 cm2 manifested severe mitral regurgitation. However, jet area measurements showed limited correlation with regurgitant volume and fraction (r = 0.55 and 0.62, respectively) for maximal jet area, and were not predictive of hemodynamic abnormalities, including those of pulmonary wedge pressure, stroke volume or ventricular volumes. Thus, in patients with mitral regurgitation, maximal jet area from Doppler color flow imaging provides a simple measurement that predicts angiographic grade, but manifests a weak correlation with regurgitant volume and does not predict hemodynamic dysfunction.\r"

Determination of the area has traditionally been accomplished at cardiac catheterization by the Gorlin equation. The valve area can also be estimated noninvasively with Doppler echocardiographic measurements of the pressure half-time, which is inversely proportional to the area. This method has gained widespread acceptance, but its accuracy has recently been questioned and factors other than reduction of orifice area appear to modify the pressure half-time. In the present study, the influence of left ventricular stiffness (defined as diastolic pressure rise per milliliter of mitral flow) and peak atrioventricular pressure difference on the pressure half-time was examined both in a hydraulic model and by review of data from 35 patients with mitral stenosis. Left ventricular stiffness less than 0.13 mm Hg/ml was considered normal. In the model study, the orifice area correlated only moderately with inverted pressure half-time (1/PHT) (r = 0.67). By multiple linear regression, inverted pressure half-time was shown to be dependent on valve area, chamber stiffness and peak pressure difference (R = 0.89), area and stiffness being most important (R = 0.85). In the clinical study, an increased ventricular stiffness was found in 22 of the 35 patients. The pressure half-time method overestimated the Gorlin-derived area by an average of 72% in these patients compared with only 10% in 13 patients with normal stiffness (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine the time course of recovery of left atrial mechanical function, serial two-dimensional, M-mode and transmitral pulsed Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed in 21 patients after elective direct current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation of 3 weeks' to 24 months' duration (mean 5 months). Over 3 months of follow-up, there were significant increases in both peak A wave velocity (p less than 0.005) and percent atrial contribution to total left ventricular filling (p less than 0.005). Compared with values in a normal control population, peak A wave velocity and percent atrial contribution to total left ventricular filling did not return to normal until 3 weeks after cardioversion in patients who remained in sinus rhythm. Left atrial dimension also decreased over the follow-up period (p less than 0.05) in patients with persistent sinus rhythm. These results may have important implications in guiding the appropriate duration of anticoagulant therapy after cardioversion, and in clinically assessing the hemodynamic benefit of restoring sinus rhythm in an individual patient.\r"

Accordingly, in the present study the dynamics of right atrial pressure-volume relations were examined (with the use of an impedance catheter to measure right atrial volume) in patients with and without an atrial septal defect. Right atrial pressure and impedance volume were measured in 16 patients at the time of cardiac catheterization with the use of a multi-electrode impedance catheter to provide continuous, on-line, pressure-volume data. Eleven patients without evidence of an interatrial shunt were examined during normal respiration and during the Valsalva maneuver and contrasted with five patients with an atrial septal defect documented by oxygen saturation step-up and echocardiographic studies. Right atrial pressure-volume diagrams in patients without an atrial septal defect exhibited the normal figure eight pattern, with an A loop (atrial contraction) and a V loop (passive filling), corresponding to the A wave and V wave of right atrial pressure, respectively. During inspiration, mean right atrial pressure decreased and mean right atrial volume increased, consistent with augmented venous return. With the Valsalva maneuver, right atrial pressure increased and both right atrial stroke volume and mean right atrial volume decreased compared with baseline. Patients with an atrial septal defect demonstrated baseline pressure-volume diagrams similar to those of patients without an interatrial shunt. However, no change in mean right atrial volume occurred with either respiration or the Valsalva maneuver despite changes in right atrial pressure similar to those seen inpatients without an atrial septal defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine predictors of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation by programmed electrical stimulation in patients with coronary artery disease and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, 14 clinical and angiographic variables were analyzed in 60 consecutive patients. All patients had angiographically documented coronary artery disease and symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias (sustained ventricular tachycardia in 21, ventricular fibrillation in 21 and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 18). Baseline programmed electrical stimulation while the patient was not taking antiarrhythmic drugs was performed with use of single, double and triple extrastimuli and burst pacing from two right ventricular sites. The variables analyzed were presenting arrhythmia; presence, frequency and complexity of ventricular ectopic activity on baseline 24 h electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring; greater than or equal to 70% narrowing in either the left anterior descending, proximal left anterior descending, right coronary or circumflex coronary artery (independently assessed); single, double or triple vessel coronary disease; anterior, apical or inferior wall motion abnormalities; segmental dyskinesia and ejection fraction. Thirty-seven patients (62%) had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (rate greater than 100 beats/min, duration greater than 30 s or requiring cardioversion) and two patients (3%) had ventricular fibrillation induced. Eleven patients (18%) had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (duration greater than or equal to 3 beats, less than 30 s) induced and 10 patients (17%) had no inducible arrhythmia (duration less than 3 beats). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis identified three independent variables predictive of inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias: sustained ventricular tachycardia as the presenting arrhythmia (p = 0.004), proximal left anterior descending artery lesion (p = 0.002) and anterior wall motion abnormality (p = 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sinus node rate was measured before induction of ventricular tachycardia (at 5 s intervals during tachycardia) and 5 s after termination of ventricular tachycardia. It increased from 85 +/- 12 beats/min to a maximum of 109 +/- 25 beats/min during stable ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001) and from 82 +/- 15 beats/min to a maximum of 105 +/- 34 beats/min during unstable ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001). During unstable ventricular tachycardia, the increase in sinus rate was more abrupt and was followed by a sharp decrease beginning before termination of the tachycardia and resulting in a slower rate after termination (56 +/- 15 beats/min) than before tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Stable ventricular tachycardia resulted in a continuous increase of sinus node rate, which remained higher after termination (102 +/- 15 beats/min) than before tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Autonomic mechanisms responsible for changes in sinus rate were evaluated by reinducing the ventricular tachycardia after beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol in 10 patients. Intravenous propranolol (mean dose 11 +/- 4 mg) had no effect on the magnitude of increase in sinus rate (+18 +/- 6 beats/min before and +17 +/- 7 beats/min after propranolol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence that chronic enhanced exogenous or endogenous catecholamine stimulation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may worsen hemodynamic status and prognosis. The cause of this deterioration may lie in myocellular calcium accumulation and microcirculatory disorders. In a prospective study, the calcium channel antagonist diltiazem was given to 22 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (60 to 90 mg three times daily) in addition to conventional therapy of digitalis, diuretics and vasodilators. Twenty-five patients received the conventional therapy and served as historical controls. Eight additional patients who were not originally included in this control group received adjunctive diltiazem treatment after initially receiving conventional therapy alone. The three patient groups were similar in all hemodynamic and anamnestic features. Only patients with reduced myofibrillar volume fraction on myocardial biopsy were included in the trial, because they could be expected to show hemodynamic deterioration. The mean survival time was 29 months in the control group, whereas no patient in the diltiazem group died over a mean follow-up period of 15.4 months (p less than 0.001). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 0.34 to 0.44 (p less than 0.001) and New York Heart Association functional class improved significantly in the diltiazem group and during the diltiazem period in the crossover patients, but deteriorated in the control group. The results suggest that adjunctive diltiazem treatment in dilated cardiomyopathy has beneficial effects on mortality, hemodynamics and symptoms.\r"

Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at baseline and during therapy with disopyramide alone, mexiletine alone and a combination of disopyramide and mexiletine. During single drug therapy, the dose of disopyramide was 602 +/- 152 mg/day and that of mexiletine was 738 +/- 144 mg/day. During combination therapy with smaller doses of disopyramide (524 +/- 134 mg/day) and mexiletine (652 +/- 146 mg/day), no patient had side effects. At baseline before therapy, the mean number of ventricular premature complexes per hour, was 608 +/- 757, of couplets per hour was 22.4 +/- 45.8 and of episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia/24 h was 219.7 +/- 758.2. The mean number of ventricular premature complexes per hour was reduced to 156 +/- 217 with disopyramide alone, 188 +/- 298 with mexiletine alone and 76 +/- 144 with combination therapy (p less than 0.05 for combination therapy versus disopyramide or mexiletine alone; p = NS for disopyramide versus mexiletine). Individually, an effective regimen (greater than 83% reduction in ventricular premature complexes and abolition of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) was found in 5 (24%) of 21 patients during therapy with disopyramide alone, in 3 (14%) receiving mexiletine alone and in 13 (62%) receiving combination therapy (p less than 0.05 for combination therapy versus disopyramide or mexiletine; p = NS for disopyramide versus mexiletine).

  ".W": "Saline contrast echocardiography was performed in 889 children from June 1976 through February 1988. One-third of these studies were in postoperative patients. A patent foramen ovale was identified by finding right to left shunting on venous contrast injection in 37% of 127 children studied with a structurally normal heart. The incidence of such shunting was greater at younger ages (55% younger than 1 month versus 22% older than 1 month). In most patients with an atrial or ventricular septal defect, some right to left shunting was demonstrable. The technique was useful in distinguishing different forms of atrial septal defect and identifying muscular ventricular septal defects that were difficult to image directly. The technique was used in the catheterization laboratory to aid in the identification of congenital coronary artery fistulas and was diagnostic in two cases of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. In patients with situs abnormalities, the technique was useful in identifying the systemic venous connections to the atria. Contrast echocardiography was also used in postoperative evaluations. The technique was useful in identifying patch leaks and residual defects after Senning, Mustard and Fontan operations, and after closure of atrial and ventricular septal defects. Most patients were found to have no superior vena cava obstruction by contrast echocardiography after the Senning or Mustard procedure. Contrast echocardiography continues to be a useful technique in the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of congenital heart disease, as well as in the postoperative evaluation of congenital heart surgery.\r"

Two patients had had previous surgery for coarctation; in the remaining 26 the coarctation had not been surgically treated. Twenty patients (71%) had a discrete type of coarctation; the remaining eight had a diffuse or eccentric stenosis. Angiographic studies of the aorta were performed before and immediately after angioplasty in all 28 patients; 16 (57%) of them also underwent angiographic reevaluation 10 +/- 2 months later. The pressure gradient decreased immediately after angioplasty and was unchanged at follow-up. Residual gradient at follow-up ranged from 0 to 40 mm Hg (mean 11 +/- 13). Patients with a discrete type of coarctation had a lesser residual gradient than did patients with other anatomic types of coarctation. Angiographically, the stenosis also decreased after angioplasty (68 +/- 10% versus 24 +/- 17%; p less than 0.01); a new small, but significant decrease was observed at follow-up (9 +/- 18%; p less than 0.05). A quantitative analysis of the aorta at different levels revealed no significant changes proximal and distal to the coarctation segment; however, at the level of coarctation, a significant (p less than 0.01) and homogeneous increment was observed after dilation that was unchanged at follow-up.

  ".W": "Doppler ultrasound is currently being widely applied to measure intracardiac pressure gradients noninvasively. In comparative invasive studies, it is generally assumed that pressure is effectively uniform distal to the stenosis. As the poststenotic jet expands, however, its velocity decreases, and pressure is recovered to the extent permitted by turbulence, so that the measured gradient will be lower if the distal catheter is positioned downstream from the vena contracta. This can lead to apparent Doppler \"overestimation\" of the pressure gradient because of this phenomenon of pressure recovery. This study demonstrates that pressure recovery can be important in a variety of clinical settings studied by in vitro models. Although most prominent in streamlined tunnels modeled after the obstruction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, these effects are important even for central stenoses at physiologic flow rates. Because precise catheter position is not always known or controlled, these findings suggest an important advantage for Doppler gradient estimation, because it provides the maximal gradient at the vena contracta, which determines the load on the proximal chamber.\r"

  ".W": "Because the extent of myocardial bulging after acute coronary occlusion is primarily dependent on wall tension, this study examined whether the decrease in systolic bulging with postextrasystolic potentiation was due to contractile reserve or to changes in loading conditions. Seven dogs were atrially paced at 100 beats/min after the sinus node was crushed and atrial extrasystoles were generated. The left ventricular minor axis diameter and segment lengths in the ischemic and nonischemic zones were measured with sonomicrometers. Wall tension was estimated using Laplace's law, and regional tension-length loops were determined. By 5 min after the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded, there was regional bulging. Postextrasystolic potentiation diminished the extent of bulging by increasing both isovolumic and ejection percent systolic shortening (isovolumic -9.1 +/- 2.0% to -5.9 +/- 1.7%, p less than 0.008; ejection 2.2 +/- 0.7% to 4.3 +/- 2.0%, p less than 0.008). The tension-length loops after coronary occlusion showed an exponential upstroke and almost superimposed downstroke consistent with passive movement. The loops were unchanged by postextrasystolic potentiation. Wall tension data showed that bulging was reduced because of a shift down the tension-length curve as end-systolic wall tension was reduced by augmented nonischemic contraction. Similar results were seen at 60 min of coronary occlusion. This study demonstrates that the decrease in bulging seen with postextrasystolic potentiation is due to changes in loading conditions and not to contractile reserve.\r"

Accordingly, the time-varying pattern of contraction within ischemic/infarct zones was studied with use of cross-sectional echocardiography in 17 dogs at 10 min to 6 weeks after acute experimental myocardial infarction. Left ventricular short-axis images were digitized from end-diastole to end-systole and endocardial fractional radial change along 36 evenly spaced rays was calculated. The circumferential extent of dyskinesia and the number of rays that exhibited maximal dyskinesia were determined for each decile of the normalized contraction sequence. Between 10 min and 1 week after infarction, the greatest circumferential extent of dyskinesia occurred between the 3rd and 4th deciles of the normalized contraction sequence. However, as the infarct matured, the greatest spatial expanse of dyskinesia was noted to occur progressively earlier in the contraction sequence (second decile at 6 weeks), and the extent of mid- to late-systolic dyskinesia decreased markedly. Whereas end-systolic dyskinesia was present in 30% to 50% of ischemic/infarct zone rays from 10 min to 48 h, end-systolic dyskinesia was no longer observed at 6 weeks. Similarly, the maximal amplitude of dyskinesia was most commonly observed during midsystole from 10 min to 48 h, but occurred progressively earlier as the infarct matured, falling during the first decile at 6 weeks after infarction. These data suggest that maximal circumferential extent and amplitude of dyskinesia occur progressively earlier in the systolic contraction sequence as the infarct matures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can provide a noninvasive means to evaluate changes in tissue lipid and, potentially, to characterize the ischemic insult. To determine whether lipids accumulate with a brief ischemic insult, myocardial lipid content was evaluated by 1H NMR spectroscopy of ex-vivo samples from seven dogs in a model of postischemic dysfunction created by 15 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Regional myocardial function was assessed by measuring segment length shortening with use of a pair of ultrasonic crystals placed in the ischemic zone and in the control zone. During the occlusion, all dogs had significant ischemia of the occlusion zone as measured by radiolabeled microspheres (0.08 +/- 0.08 versus 0.88 +/- 0.09 ml/g per min for the control zone), and all dogs developed systolic stretching of the ischemic zone segment. Myocardial lipid content was significantly elevated in the samples from the coronary occlusion zone (p less than 0.02). The increase in lipid signal may result from the ischemia-induced decrease in beta oxidation and resultant accumulation of fatty acyl esters (for example, fatty acids, triglycerides and acylcarnitines). In conclusion, this study shows that myocardium subjected to a brief (approximately 15 min) coronary occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion demonstrates a significant increase in NMR-detectable lipid content.\r"

To elucidate the metabolic fate of exogenous glucose entering reperfused myocardium, D-[6-14C] glucose and L-[U-13C] lactate were used to determine glucose uptake, glucose oxidation and the contribution of exogenous glucose to lactate production. The pathologic model under investigation consisted of a 3 h balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 24 h of reperfusion in canine myocardium. The extent and severity of myocardial injury after the ischemia and reperfusion were assessed by histochemical evaluation (triphenyltetrazolium chloride and periodic acid-Schiff stains). Thirteen intervention and four control dogs were studied. The glucose uptake in the occluded/reperfused area was significantly enhanced compared with that in control dogs (0.40 +/- 0.14 versus 0.15 +/- 0.10 mumol/ml, respectively). In addition, a significantly greater portion of the glucose extracted immediately entered glycolysis in the intervention group (75%) than in the control dogs (33%). The activity of the nonoxidative glycolytic pathway was markedly increased in the ischemically injured reperfused area, as evidenced by the four times greater lactate release in this area compared with the control value. The dual carbon-labeled isotopes showed that 57% of the exogenous glucose entering glycolysis was being converted to lactate. Exogenous glucose contributed to greater than 90% of the observed lactate production. This finding was confirmed by the histochemical finding of sustained glycogen depletion in the occlusion/reperfusion area. The average area of glycogen depletion (37%) significantly exceeded the average area of necrosis (17%). These data demonstrate enhanced and sustained activity of the nonoxidative glycolytic pathway after a prolonged occlusion with reperfusion in canine myocardium. Because glycogen stores remain depleted, exogenous glucose becomes an important myocardial substrate under these pathologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The object of this study was to test the hypothesis that administration of both serotonin S2 and thromboxane A2-prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) receptor antagonists provides significant protection against epinephrine-induced cyclic coronary artery flow variations in open chest, anesthetized dogs with severe proximal coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury. Three groups of dogs were studied. In Group 1 (n = 7) and Group 2 (n = 6), cyclic coronary flow variations were initiated after placement of a concentric constrictor around the left anterior descending coronary artery and were abolished by administration of either a thromboxane A2-prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist, SQ29,548 (SQ) (Group 1), or a serotonin S2 receptor antagonist, LY53,857 (LY) (Group 2). Cyclic flow variations were restored with an epinephrine infusion and the second antagonist (LY for Group 1; SQ for Group 2) was administered to abolish epinephrine-induced cyclic flow variations. The rate of epinephrine infusion was increased until cyclic coronary flow variations returned (n = 8) or significant hemodynamic changes occurred. Plasma epinephrine concentrations were determined during a control period of cyclic coronary flow variations, after epinephrine restored cyclic flow variations in the presence of either SQ or LY, and again after epinephrine restored cyclic flow variations in the presence of both SQ and LY. A third group of dogs (Group 3, n = 9) required both SQ and LY to eliminate the initial cyclic coronary flow variations and infused epinephrine restored cyclic flow variations (n = 8). Plasma epinephrine concentrations were determined during a control period and after cyclic coronary flow variation restoration with epinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A simple, minimally invasive procedure for monitoring cutaneous mast cell degranulation in vivo in man is described. Plasma histamine levels in venous blood draining the site of intradermal histamine, morphine, and antigen challenges were determined with a modified radioenzymatic assay. Elevations in plasma histamine above baseline levels of 0 to 0.6 ng/ml were measured after intradermal histamine; levels of 1.4 to 85.2 ng/ml were obtained after a 2 microgram intradermal challenge in 16 subjects. After antigen testing, peak plasma histamine levels ranged from 1.1 to 24.4 ng/ml (n = 9), and after morphine sulfate skin testing peak plasma histamine levels ranged from 2.3 to 12.7 ng/ml (n = 4). The time to achieve peak plasma histamine levels ranged from 2 to 10 minutes after histamine, from 5 to 15 minutes after antigen, and from 1 to 8 minutes after morphine challenges. Plasma levels returned to baseline within 30 minutes after histamine and morphine challenges but took more than 60 minutes for antigen challenges. With careful choice of the skin test site in relation to venous drainage, plasma histamine increases after either histamine or antigen were reproducible and reliable. Plasma histamine levels peaked 5 to 10 minutes before maximal development of the wheal-and-flare responses after histamine, antigen, or morphine skin tests. The wheal-and-flare skin tests continued to increase in magnitude despite rapidly declining plasma histamine levels. Thus skin tests eliciting reactions ordinarily seen in an allergist's office cause measurable increases in plasma histamine levels that can be used to directly monitor mast cell degranulation in man in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients were administered cephamandole parenterally and, if this was tolerated, a course of oral cephaloridine was administered. Only two patients responded to the cephamandole; none of the remaining patients reacted to cephaloridine. Benzylpenicilloyl RAST-inhibition studies with sera from three subjects who had not reacted to the cephalosporins demonstrated that cephamandole linked to proteins was capable of recognizing benzylpenicilloyl-specific IgE antibody. It is concluded that consideration of side chain structures can help to predict possible cross-reactions between penicillins and cephalosporins, but carefully controlled challenge tests are advisable before penicillin-allergic patients are treated with cephalosporins. In relation to cross-reacting potential, in vitro experimental studies are difficult to interpret and may in some circumstances overestimate the risk.\r"

  ".W": "Hyposensitization therapy with each of three sea squirt antigens, Gi-rep (molecular weight [MW] 106,000), Ei-M (MW 22,800), and DIIIa (MW 9980), have succeeded in 72%, 90%, and 36% of patients with sea squirt allergy, respectively, within the first year, and the effect has been maintained during subsequent 4-year maintenance therapy. All available sera from some of the hyposensitized patients were also examined for IgE and IgG titers against the most effective therapeutic antigen, Ei-M, and it was revealed that the Ei-M-specific IgG titer increased rapidly in the successfully hyposensitized patients, regardless of the therapeutic antigen used, except for a few patients. Furthermore, the high specific IgG titer, as well as the therapeutic effect, was maintained during the subsequent maintenance therapy. No such increase in the specific IgG titer was detected in all unsuccessfully hyposensitized patients. In contrast, the Ei-M-specific IgE titer was practically unchanged in all allergic patients, independent of the therapy. Therefore, the effect of the hyposensitization therapy was closely dependent on the induction of the specific IgG capable of competing with the specific IgE for a certain asthma-inducing antigen, like DIIIa. The apparently low therapeutic efficiency of DIIIa was attributed to its relatively low immunogenicity to induce the specific IgG.\r"

More than 90% of the eosinophils (purity greater than 93%) with a density between 1.095 to 1.105 gm/ml were defined normodense.

Isolation of eosinophils of patients with atopic asthma revealed a cell population with 65% to 70% hypodense cells that was independent of the total eosinophilic cell count. In vitro activation of normodense eosinophils, measured by an increase in superoxide production, induced quantities of hypodense eosinophils in the range found in patients with asthma. The amount of hypodense eosinophils induced by different stimuli was in the same order as the increase in superoxide production (antibiotic calcium ionophore A23187 greater than serum-treated zymosan greater than platelet-activating factor greater than N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl phenylalanine). During the stimulation of the normodense cells, no secretion of eosinophilic peroxidase or arylsulfatase B could be measured, even though hypodense eosinophils were produced. Enzymatic activity of arylsulfatase B within the eosinophils remained the same, before and after stimulation.

The effects of theophylline and enprofylline on the late cutaneous response (LCR) to compound 48/80 and antigen were studied in 29 patients enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the effect of the xanthines in mild asthma. Skin testing to a common environment allergen and compound 48/80 was performed during a baseline period and in the second phase of the study after stable drug levels were achieved, at least 6 weeks later. During baseline, the mean immediate wheal diameter (IWD) with antigen was 15.7 mm +/- 0.5, resulting in 27/29 LCRs with a mean wheal diameter of 37.1 mm +/- 5.2. The mean IWD with compound 48/80 was 16.1 mm +/- 0.7, resulting in 26/29 LCRs with a mean wheal diameter of 19.6 mm +/- 2.8. Repeat skin testing during treatment revealed no statistically significant changes in the LCR elicited by antigen or 48/80 in any of the treatment groups. There was little correlation between the size of the immediate wheal produced by antigen or 48/80 and the resulting size of the late response (r = 0.174 to 0.519). However, for the same IWD, the resulting late response was smaller with 48/80 than with antigen (p = 0.003). We conclude that (1) theophylline and enprofylline have no effect on the LCR to 48/80 and antigen and (2) for equivalent immediate wheal sizes, the resulting late response is smaller with 48/80 than with antigen.\r"

Even in this selected patient population, only two patients had symptomatic hypersensitivity to two legumes. Among patients with a positive prick skin test to peanut (N = 60), the mean wheal size was larger in patients with a positive versus a negative oral food challenge to peanut (p less than 0.001). Results of oral food challenges demonstrate that clinically important cross-reactivity to legumes in children is very rare. Clinical hypersensitivity to one legume does not warrant dietary elimination of all legumes. Results of prick skin tests should not be used to determine prolonged food restriction diets.\r"

To determine whether mast cells in the lumen of the airways of hyperreactive Basenji greyhound (BG) dogs differ from those of mongrel dogs with normal airway reactivity, we investigated the morphologic and functional characteristics of mast cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). BAL was performed in five BG and five mongrel dogs with 900 cc of a buffered salt solution. The recovered lavage fluid contained 115 +/- 19 X 10(6) and 116 +/- 14 X 10(6) (mean +/- SEM) cells in BG and mongrel dogs, respectively. The proportion of all mast cells within the recovered cell population as enumerated after fixation with basic lead acetate and staining with alcian blue was not different in BG and mongrel dogs and averaged 0.80 +/- 0.07% and 1.1 +/- 0.3%, respectively. Typical mast cells as identified after fixation with paraformaldehyde were rare; however, significantly more mast cells were found in mongrel (0.03 +/- 0.009%) than in BG dogs (0.004 +/- 0.002%; p less than 0.02). Mast cells recovered from BG and mongrel dogs were not different in their low spontaneous histamine release (2.0 +/- 0.5% and 2.9 +/- 0.8%), their histamine release on stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 (maximum release 44.8 +/- 5.7% and 41.5 +/- 3.9%), and their lack of response to compound 48/80 (maximum release 5.8 +/- 1.8% and 6.1 +/- 6.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Certain eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid are potent mediators of skin inflammation and modulators of certain T-lymphocyte activities. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether eicosanoids are present in biologically active concentrations in the skin of adult patients with AD. The levels of the cyclooxygenase product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the lipoxygenase products, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were determined in biopsy specimens obtained by keratome from lesional, perilesional, and clinically unaffected skin of patients with AD. Methods for identification of eicosanoids included reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassays. Eicosanoid levels were at the same level in normal skin and in uninvolved skin of AD. Compared with uninvolved skin, both lesional and perilesional skin contained markedly elevated concentrations of PGE2 and LTB4: PGE2, 97.2 +/- 15.6 ng/gm of lesional skin and 128.3 +/- 27.2 ng/gm of perilesional skin; LTB4, 5.2 +/- 1.6 ng/gm of lesional skin and 3.2 +/- 0.6 ng/gm of perilesional skin. Compared with uninvolved skin, the levels of 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were elevated sevenfold and elevenfold, respectively, in lesional skin, but did not reach biologically active concentrations. The results demonstrate that the inflammatory mediators PGE2 and LTB4 are present in lesional skin of atopic subjects in biologically active concentrations. Because these mediators are able to induce cutaneous inflammation and to modulate cellular immunity, they may be involved in the biochemical processes leading to AD.\r"

Over 13 days, 12 of 60 residents developed influenza. Prior influenza vaccination had been given to 94% of the residents. Protection from infection occurred in those tested who had antibody levels greater than or equal to 1:16 to the A/Leningrad (H3N2) antigen contained in the standard 1987-88 trivalent vaccine. However, five of 17 vaccinated residents who were tested had antibody levels less than or equal to 1:16 at the start of the outbreak. Amantadine (less than or equal to 100 mg/day) was given to all but one resident starting on the third day of the outbreak, and to employees starting on the sixth day of the outbreaks. Seven residents developed illness after the start of amantadine, although amantadine appeared to ameliorate their symptoms. Although amantadine was generally well tolerated by residents, employees receiving amantadine identified a high incidence of side effects and only 44% of employees took at least 70% of the prescribed amantadine. In our opinion, early detection and protocol-directed intervention probably abated a more severe influenza outbreak. Therefore we support existing recommendations that formal nursing home policies be established to ensure that residents and employees receive annual influenza vaccine and that chemoprophylaxis be used when outbreaks of influenza A are suspected.\r"

  ".U": "89140134\r", 
  ".W": "Mild to moderate hearing loss has been hypothesized to decrease performance on verbally-administered cognitive tests as an artifact of testing. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized trial of a written version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a cognitive screening instrument which, in its standard form, is primarily verbally administered. After baseline standard MMSE testing, 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's type dementia, 39 of whom (55%) had mild to moderate hearing deficits, and 32 of whom (45%) had normal hearing, were randomly assigned to receive either a written or standard MMSE. Hearing-impaired patients exhibited lower standard MMSE scores than hearing-unimpaired patients at baseline (P = .005). Contrary to expectation, however, on experimental administration, written MMSE scores were somewhat lower than standard MMSE scores in hearing-impaired patients (P not significant). Furthermore, written MMSE scores were slightly higher than standard MMSE scores in hearing-unimpaired patients (P not significant). These results suggest that the diminished cognitive performance associated with mild to moderate hearing loss is not necessarily an artifact of cognitive testing. In addition, these results provide preliminary evidence that a written MMSE is comparable to the standard MMSE and, thus, deserves further consideration for cognitive screening of profoundly hearing-impaired individuals.\r"

  ".W": "There are no large studies on long-term treatment of nursing home patients with pressure sores. A 4-year experience of treating 95 nursing home patients on air-fluidized beds was reviewed. Treated patients were elderly (median age 73 years) and neurologically impaired (79% with dementia, cerebral vascular accident, or anoxic encephalopathy). The index pressure sores (deepest truncal sore for each patient) were large (median surface area 35.3 cm2) and commonly located on the sacrum (41%) and trochanters (38%). Only 13 of 95 (14%) index sores healed completely, and only two small sores healed in less than 30 days. No others treated less than 30 days had greater than or equal to 50% reduction in sore surface area. Patients were grouped according to whether or not treatment was less than 30 days, and for those treated greater than or equal to 30 days, according to whether or not greater than or equal to 50% reduction in sore surface area occurred. None of the easily measured patient characteristics examined were associated with longer or more successful treatment. These results indicate that although air-fluidized beds can be used to treat pressure sores successfully, even in severely debilitated nursing home patients, no simple criteria can be used to predict which patients will benefit from this treatment. Because long periods of time are necessary for treatment [median trial length 79 days and 17 of 95 (18%) trials greater than 180 days], substantial patient-care expenditures result.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The five settings studied include a state mental health facility, a nursing home, a visiting nurse service, a senior center, and a control group of well elderly. The inclusion of the home care and control groups in this study provide new tests of the applicability of the FAI. The sample consisted of 125 elderly individuals with 25 subjects in each of the five groups. The FAI questionnaire was administered to the subjects and/or an informant when necessary. Results of a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that the more functionally impaired individuals were utilizing the more care-intensive settings. The FAI identified three distinct \"cluster groups\": an institutional cluster (state mental health facility and nursing home), a home care cluster (visiting nurse service), and a community cluster (senior center and control group). Analysis of the subscale scores reveals discrete differences between each of the groups. Implications of the study findings are discussed.\r"

People aged 65 and older with cognitive impairment were twice as likely as age-matched unimpaired elders to report sufficient symptoms of psychiatric disorders to qualify for a current diagnosis (16% vs 7%), and were also more likely to qualify for a lifetime diagnosis (25% vs 15%). We considered whether this excess could be due to random responses by the impaired, but found the rank order of their symptoms very similar to that of the unimpaired. Although dementia is thought to affect recent more than remote memory, the impaired were no less likely than the unimpaired to report disorders of recent onset. We also compared the cognitively impaired and unimpaired with respect to their reliability as assessed by reinterview one year later and found no significant difference. We conclude that there is no reason to believe that the excess of disorders in the mildly impaired is an artifact caused by their poorer performance as respondents. Interviewing the elderly person with cognitive impairment is a useful way of discovering concurrent disorders that may be treatable.\r"

To assess the progress of this effort, we surveyed physicians (284 in geriatric medicine and 91 in geropsychiatry) who graduated from U.S. geriatrics fellowship programs. Responses were obtained from 224 medicine (79% response) and 59 psychiatry fellows (65% response). Sixty-five percent of former geriatric medicine fellows report spending 10% or less time on teaching; 44% report doing no research, and 44% report spending more than half their time in patient care. Compared to other primary care specialties, the geriatricians reported caring for larger proportions of older patients and spending more time per patient visit. However, their role in teaching, research, and long-term care is minimal.\r"

The ability of these transfected cell lines to activate autoreactive T hybrids was markedly impaired whereas loss of Ag presentation to nominal Ag-specific T hybrids was more subtle. Ia-mediated transmembrane signaling as measured by PKC translocation from cytosol to nucleus after stimulation with anti-Ak antibody was greatly affected by truncation of the A beta and A alpha cytoplasmic domains. These results indicate an important role for the highly conserved cytoplasmic domain in Ia-mediated responses.\r"

  ".W": "A minor T cell determinant from pigeon cytochrome c, composed of residues 43 to 58 (p43-58), was synthesized along with a series of 48 analogs containing amino or carboxyl-terminal deletions or single amino acid substitutions. These peptides were analyzed functionally for their ability to elicit unique T cell populations on immunization of C57BL/10 mice and to stimulate a degenerate T cell clone capable of recognizing p43-58 in association with two different Ia molecules, A beta b:A alpha b and A beta d:A alpha d. These experiments allowed us to identify the residues in the determinant that are critical for T cell activation. Residues 50 and 52 had the dominant influence on T cell specificity, and residues 47, 48, 49, 51, and 53 had weak effects. Residues 46 and 54 were hardly recognized by the TCR at all, but appeared to influence the potency of the determinant by interacting with the Ia molecule. Finally, substitutions at positions 55 to 58 had no effect, but removal of these residues reduced the potency of the peptide, suggesting a contribution from the peptide backbone of this part of the molecule during T cell activation. An analysis of the spatial relationship of these dominant epitopic and agretopic residues suggests that this determinant does not assume a pure alpha-helical secondary structure when bound to the Ia molecule.\r"

We also elucidated that a limited number of non-H-2 genes of parental C3H/He or AKR/J mice that had been incorporated into the F1 hybrids determined the F1 resistance to the GAIS, and the present study was done to explore the mechanism implicated in this type of F1 resistance to GAIS. SC from B10.AL mice carrying an rH-2 (K:k I:k S:k D:d) haplotype but not SC from H-2K B10.BR (k k k k) mice induced GAIS of in vitro CTL responses to third-party alloantigens in H-2k/d (C3H/He x B10.D2)F1 recipients mice. Further, SC from H-2k/a (C3H/He x B10.A)F1 mice carrying heterozygous C3H/B10 non-H-2 background but not SC from the same H-2k/a (B10.BR x B10.A)F1 mice but carrying homozygous B10/B10 background induced GAIS in H-2k/d (C3H/He x B10.D2)F1 recipients. Although C3H/He-, B10.BR-, and C3H.OH (d d d k)-SC were incapable of inducing GAIS in (C3H/He x B10.D2)F1 (k/d k/d k/d k/d) recipients, they were all good inducers of GAIS in (C3H.OH x B10.BR)F1 (d/k d/k d/k k/k) recipients. Exactly the same pattern of co-operative non-H-2 AKR and H-2D region-gene control of GAIS was observed on GvHR induced in H-2k/d (AKR/J x B10.D2)F1 recipients. These results suggest that the non-H-2 genes of C3H/He or AKR/J strain inhibit the functional expression of certain antigenic determinant(s) when it is encoded by heterozygous but not homozygous gene(s) linked tightly to H-2D region of k haplotype. Thus, the F1 resistance to GAIS is mediated by immune response of F1 recipients who miss the antigenic determinant(s) against that expressed on cell surface of GvHR-inducing T lymphocytes.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to identify an encephalitogenic determinant of PLP for SJL mice. We immunized SJL/J mice with a synthetic peptide identical to residues 130-147 QAHSLERVCHCLGKWLGH of murine PLP, a sequence having an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation. Although it did not induce disease, an overlapping peptide containing residues 139-154 HCLGKWLGHPDKFVGI was encephalitogenic. Immunization with this peptide induced severe clinical and histologic EAE in 3 of 20 mice. T cell enriched ILN cells from these mice responded specifically (3H-thymidine incorporation) to this peptide as well as to shorter analogues of this domain containing serine in place of cysteine at residues 138 and 140. Immunization with the serine-substituted PLP peptides 137-151 VSHSLGKWLGHPDKF and 139-151 HSLGKWLGHPDKF induced severe, acute EAE in 4 of 9 and 15 of 15 SJL mice, respectively, and their T cell enriched ILN cells responded not only to the analogues, but also to the native PLP sequence 139-154. These results indicate that residues 139-151 of murine PLP is an encephalitogenic determinant for SJL mice. Furthermore, like the PLP encephalitogenic domain for SWR (H-2q) mice, this determinant is also a T cell epitope with a coding sequence at the end of an exon.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that the alpha'-chain of human activated form of the fourth (C4b) and third (C3b) component of C are cleaved by plasma or serum from vertebrate species spanning through 300,000,000 yr of evolution yielding fragments identical with those obtained with human plasma. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of this reaction. We chose barred sand bass plasma because this is the most primitive species analyzed possessing these activities. Barred sand bass plasma proteins were separated on a Sephadex G-200 column and the eluted samples analyzed for C4b and C3b cleavage. Individual fractions were inactive, but degradation was obtained when proteins of 380 and 155 kDa were combined. In contrast to the human regulatory proteins, the sand bass proteins require Ca2+ ions. K76COOH, an inhibitor of human factor I, inhibited the function of the 155-kDa but not of the 380 kDa-fraction. Thus it appears that the 155-kDa fraction functions as the C4b/C3b cleaving enzyme (I) and the 380-kDa material as its cofactor. Further purification of the 380-kDa fraction yielded a protein that by SDS-PAGE consisted of two noncovalently linked subunits of 110 and 42 kDa at a molecular ratio of 2:1. These two chains were antigenically distinct, and constitute domains of the same protein. The 110-kDa peptide binds C4b and not C3b but it fully expresses the cofactor function for the 155-kDa fraction on the cleavage of both C4b and C3b. Limited tryptic digestion of the 110-kDa domain demonstrated C4b binding activity in fragments of 34, 25, and 23 kDa. The activity of the 34-kDa fragment was the same as that of the undigested protein. Comparison of the amino acid composition of the barred sand bass cofactor and of human C4bp shows similar high content of cysteine and proline but not of tryptophan. It differs from human factor H in cysteine, serine, proline, and tryptophan. These studies indicate that regulatory proteins for the C4b and C3b C fragments may have appeared very early phylogenetically.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the changes in protein kinase C (PKC) which follow IgE-mediated activation of basophils. Exposure to 0.1 microgram/ml anti-IgE resulted in an increase in total cellular PKC (169 +/- 23% of control, histamine release (HR) = 33 +/- 7%, n = 12) which could be accounted for solely by the increase in membrane-associated PKC. These changes reached a maximum (280 +/- 48%) 1.0 min after challenge and declined to 190 +/- 38% after 5.0 min though histamine release was not complete until 5 to 10 min later. We found a good correlation between the increase in membrane-associated PKC and the eventual release of histamine (rs = 0.902). Donors whose basophils released less than 5% total histamine (n = 3, HR = 3 +/- 1%) showed a partial activation of PKC (173 +/- 18%) though much less than the remaining donors (increase in PKC = 346 +/- 59%, n = 9, HR = 43 +/- 7%). We observed no redistribution of cytosolic PKC at any time following exposure to anti-IgE. In contrast, 0.1 microgram/ml 2-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (HR = 36 +/- 3%, n = 3) promoted an increase in total cellular PKC, the loss of 31 +/- 4% of the cytosolic PKC and an 816 +/- 183% increase in membrane-associated PKC. Activation of PKC by anti-IgE was only partially dependent on extracellular calcium. In the absence of calcium, the increase in PKC was approximately 65% (n = 4) of that noted in the presence of 1mM calcium but these levels were sustained over much longer periods, failing to return to base line after 30 min. Higher than normal concentrations of calcium (5 to 10 mM) promoted rapid increases in PKC activity and accelerated the return to base line (back to prechallenge levels by 5 min). Suboptimal concentrations of anti-IgE (0.01 microgram/ml) attenuated the changes in membrane associated PKC and altered the kinetics of the response. The time required to reach maximum activity increased from 1.0 to 5.0 min with a corresponding decrease in the rate at which histamine was released. Higher concentrations of anti-IgE (1.0 microgram/ml) promoted a rapid increase in PKC (maximum increase in PKC = 501 +/- 59%, time = 0.5 min, HR = 28 +/- 2%) followed by an equally rapid return to base line levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89140360\r", 
  ".W": "TNF stimulated superoxide (O2-) release directly in human granulocytes in a dose-dependent manner (1 to 1000 U/ml), although its potency was weak. TNF-induced O2- release was inhibited by cAMP agonists or ionomycin, and was not accompanied with an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) and membrane potential changes (depolarization). These findings indicate that neither Ca2+ mobilization nor membrane depolarization is required for TNF-receptor-mediated cell activation. The pretreatment of human granulocytes with TNF enhanced O2- release and membrane depolarization in parallel stimulated by the receptor-mediated Ca2+-mobilizing agonists (FMLP, Con A, and wheat germ agglutinin) or the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, but not by PMA, a direct activator of protein kinase C. The optimal effect was obtained by pretreatment of cells with 100 U/ml TNF for 5 to 10 min at 37 degrees C, although the magnitude of enhancement varied according to the agonists used as subsequent stimuli. TNF did not affect an increase in [Ca2+]i stimulated by the Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, except Con A. Con A-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was enhanced by TNF in a dose-dependent manner. These diverse effects of TNF could be partly explained by the exclusive potentiation by TNF of the metabolic events triggered by an increase in [Ca2+]i.\r"

This IgG receptor was degraded by pepsin. A separate receptor, binding only mouse monoclonal IgG3 was observed on cultured parasites. A receptor binding rabbit, rat, and mouse IgM was found on cultured and peritoneal parasites, but not on blood parasites. This receptor did not bind IgG or IgA but it bound mouse and rat IgE as well as IgM. It was degraded by trypsin. IgG and IgM/IgE receptors were co-expressed on single parasites. They were not of host origin but synthesized by trypanosomes as shown by reexpression in vitro after proteolytic degradation.

  ".W": "Low-dose ultraviolet (UV) B irradiation suppresses contact hypersensitivity (CH) reactions and alters the antigen-presenting function of epidermal cells (EC) in mice. To identify the EC sources of immunosuppression in this system, we examined the effect of UVB on the capacity of EC to induce and to regulate CH to trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB). On day 0, cell sorter-purified populations of Ia+EC, Thy-1+EC, or Ia-/Thy-1-EC from CBA and C3H/HeJ mice were exposed to 200 J/m2 UVB from unfiltered FS20 Sunlamps, derivatized with hapten, and inoculated intravenously into syngeneic mice (5000 cells per inoculum). After 6 d, responsiveness was tested by challenging the left ear with 2% TNCB and measuring ear swelling responses. On day 14, regulation was tested by painting 7% TNCB on abdominal skin; after 6 d the right ear was challenged. Whereas mice which received haptenated unirradiated Ia+EC exhibited full CH responses without down-regulation, mice inoculated with haptenated irradiated Ia+EC displayed significantly diminished primary responses and, on subsequent immunization, displayed down-regulation. On the other hand, panels of mice that received haptenated unirradiated Thy-1+EC, and haptenated irradiated Thy-1+EC both showed hyporesponsiveness as well as down-regulation. Intravenous immunization with haptenated unirradiated Ia-/Thy-1-EC or with haptenated irradiated Ia-/Thy-1-EC led in each instance to immunologically \"null events.\" These findings indicate that UVB irradiation profoundly affected Ia+EC such that their capacity to sensitize for CH was not only abrogated, but that such treatment also resulted in down-regulation of CH responses. By contrast, the same phototreatment had no effect on the inherent property of Thy-1+EC to mediate down-regulation of CH. We conclude that Ia+EC are immunologically relevant targets of low-dose UVB radiation, and that two populations of irradiated EC, Ia+EC, and Thy-1+EC, have the potential to deliver down-regulatory signals in this model of immunosuppression.\r"

At low calcium, cells were dispersed without desmosomal cell-cell contact and the KIFs were mostly concentrated around the nucleus. After 15 min of the transfer, cells contacted each other and formed small colonies and the KIFs initiated to show a radial arrangement. In addition to the cell-cell contact formation and rearrangement of KIFs, the transfer induced fourfold increase of particulate-associated protein kinase C (C-kinase) activity. When 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (PMA), which specifically activates C-kinase, was added to the cells grown at low calcium medium, cell-cell contact formation and radial arrangement of KIF bundles almost identical to those induced by the transfer to high calcium medium were observed. These data suggest a correlation between an increase in C-kinase activity and formation of cell-cell contacts associated with rearrangements of KIFs.\r"

However, no significant differences in these reactive patterns were found between healthy volunteers and Pso patients. In the second experiment, anti-KIF-Abs in sera from Pso patients, pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP) patients, atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and healthy volunteers were determined by ELISA, using as substrate keratins purified from normal human stratum corneum and 48- and 50-kd keratins purified from psoriatic stratum corneum. The serum titers of anti-KIF-Abs against 48- and 50-kd keratins in Pso patients were significantly higher than those in PPP patients, AD patients, SLE patients, or healthy volunteers. The elevated titers of anti-KIF-Abs against the 48- and 50-kd keratins in sera of Pso patients showed a significant decrease with improvement of psoriatic lesions. The above results suggest that anti-KIF-Abs against 48- and 50-kd keratins in sera of Pso patients have some relevance to the severity of the disease and can be used as a marker for the evaluation of the disease activity of psoriasis.\r"

In addition, linoleic acid (18:2) is present in substantial quantities, implying that it is an important structural component. To investigate selectivity of fatty acid incorporation into epidermal lipids, we examined the metabolism of exogenous fatty acids in cultured human keratinocytes, grown at the air-medium interface to enhance differentiation. Keratinocytes were pulsed with [3H] oleic, [14C] stearic, [14C] palmitic, or [14C] linoleic acids; lipids were extracted and fractionated by thin layer chromatography. All fatty acids were taken up and incorporated into complex lipids in a dose-dependent manner that was linear over the first 60 min. These fatty acids were incorporated predominantly into phospholipids and triacylglycerols; their incorporation could be rank ordered: linoleic greater than oleic greater than or equal to palmitic greater than stearic acid. Less than 2% of each fatty acid taken up by keratinocytes was oxidized to CO2; therefore, these differences in utilization cannot be ascribed to differences in rates of beta-oxidation. In pulse-chase studies fatty acids incorporated initially into triacylglycerols, subsequently chased into phospholipids. [14C]Palmitic acid and [14C] acetate were incorporated into sphingolipids more efficiently than the other fatty acids studied. These studies demonstrate that 1) keratinocytes have the ability to incorporate exogenous fatty acids preferentially into complex lipids; 2) triacylglycerols provide a pool of fatty acids for phospholipid synthesis; and 3) palmitate and de novo synthesized fatty acid are preferably utilized for sphingolipid synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "In this study the synthesis of cholesterol sulfate is examined in relation to the process of squamous differentiation in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in culture. During the exponential growth phase, NHEK cells exhibit a relatively high colony-forming efficiency and appear undifferentiated on the basis of their morphology and expression of biochemical characteristics. At confluence, the cells undergo terminal differentiation that is characterized by the commitment to terminal cell division (reduction in colony-forming ability) and expression of the differentiated phenotype. An accumulation of cholesterol sulfate accompanies this program of differentiation. This accumulation of cholesterol sulfate parallels the increase in transglutaminase type I activity and the competence to form cross-linked envelopes, whereas it precedes the \"spontaneous\" formation of cross-linked envelopes. Increased cholesterol sulfotransferase activity appears to account for the increase in cholesterol sulfate. The cholesterol sulfate accumulation, as well as the increase in cholesterol sulfotransferase and transglutaminase activity, are inhibited by retinoids. However, the presence of retinoids does not prevent NHEK cells from undergoing terminal cell division at confluence. Two NHEK cell lines expressing SV40-large T antigen also undergo terminal differentiation at confluence and start to accumulate cholesterol sulfate. Two other, differentiation-defective cell lines do not exhibit an increase in cholesterol sulfate at confluence. These results show that epidermal keratinocytes in culture, like cells in the epidermis, accumulate cholesterol sulfate when undergoing squamous differentiation. This program appears to consist of a retinoid-insensitive step (commitment to terminal cell division) and a retinoid-sensitive step (expression of the squamous differentiated phenotype).\r"

In order to explore potential spectral markers characteristic of diseased tissue, perchloric acid (PCA) extracts of psoriasis and malignant melanoma tissues were compared with normal skin, and changes in melanoma after heat treatment were monitored. In psoriatic plaque extract, the spectral peak intensity ratios of Glu: Ser, creatine: Gly, and taurine: Ala were approximately three-fold compared with symptom-free or normal skin, whereas Val: Leu/Ile was one-half the normal skin ratio. In melanoma extracts, the phosphorylcholine (PC)/glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC): Ala, Glu: Ser, and lactate: Ala ratios were five-, three-, and two-fold higher, respectively, than normal skin and the Val: Leu/Ile ratio was two-thirds of normal skin. With heat treatment, PC/GPC: Ala and Glu: Ser ratios decreased, whereas lactate: Ala and Val: Leu/Ile ratios increased three-fold and one-third, respectively. Results indicate that 1H NMR spectroscopy is a sufficiently sensitive technique to distinguish normal from diseased skin. The main attraction of this technique lies in the possibility of non-invasive study of various skin diseases, malignant transformation of benign tumors, and responses to treatment. Several methodologic problems remain to be resolved before a meaningful interpretation of in vivo observations becomes feasible. Correlation of in vivo and in vitro findings is an essential step toward this goal.\r"

The internalization was visualized by immunogoldlabeling, and the reappearance of CD1a binding sites was shown by immunogoldrelabeling. The relabeling was distinguished from the labeling either by using two sizes of gold granules (15 and 5 nm) or by quantitative estimation with one size of gold granules, before and after the relabeling. This reappearance of sites is cycloheximide insensitive, and is evidenced, even if the transfer of gold particles to lysosomes is blocked by the monensin. These results suggest that the reexpression of CD1a antigens is due to antigens stored in the cytoplasm or to recycling of internalized sites. Some immunolabeled Birbeck granules were observed in continuity with the plasma membrane, which demonstrates their membrane origin and their involvement in the endocytosis process. However, the weak labeling of these organelles makes us believe that they are not specialized CD1a endocytosis structures.\r"

Positivity was recovered in follicular cells at the duct of the sebaceous gland and was maintained in the upper outer root sheath where those cells fuse with the keratinocyte basal monolayer. Changes were also detected on different phases of the hair cycle. Follicles in the catagen-telogen phase expressed a very low number of positive cells in the matrix. Positive labeling progressively increased when the follicle was at the initial anagen stage, reaching a complete staining pattern in hair at the anagen phase. These results suggest that the expression of this activation antigen on hair keratinocytes may be related to the proliferation, active metabolism, and/or activation states of these cell types.\r"

  ".W": "Intercellular lipid lamellae in the stratum corneum constitute the barrier to water diffusion and may also play a role in cohesion between corneocytes. The lamellae arise from stacks of lamellar disks that are extruded from the granular cells and then fuse edge-to-edge to form sheets. It has been proposed that each lamellar disk is formed from a flattened vesicle, and therefore consists of two lipid bilayers in close apposition. In the present study, electron microscopic examination of ruthenium-tetroxide-fixed stratum corneum from mouse, pig, and human skin revealed that the double bilayer pattern persists in the intercellular lamellae. In addition, distinctive patterning of the intercellular lamellae has led us to propose novel molecular arrangements of the intercellular lipids. These include interlamellar sharing of lipid chains to produce lipid monolayers between pairs of bilayers. The pattern reflects the provenance of the intercellular lamellae from lamellar granule disks and the nonrandom orientation of the lamellar lipids.\r"

The gene (gUHSK-704Eco) was isolated as a member of a gene cluster on a recombinant phage with a DNA insert of 18 kb that was isolated by screening a murine genomic library at low stringency with a synthetic oligonucleotide derived from a sheep high sulfur keratin gene (Powell, Nucleic Acids Res. 1983 11, 5327). The murine ultra-high sulfur keratin gene has no intervening sequence; the 558 nucleotide of the coding region specify 186 amino acids, of which 70 (37%) are cysteine. A Cys-Cys-Gln-Pro repeat is found 12 times within the coding region. RNA dot blots show that the ultra-high sulfur keratin gene is expressed during the hair cycle concomitant with the anterior-posterior temporal pattern of the normal murine hair cycle.\r"

  ".W": "We examine the effect of keratinocyte differentiation upon transient expression of a nonepithelial gene following DNA-mediated transfer. Cultures of primary epidermal keratinocytes were transfected with the reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The CAT gene was linked at the 5' end to the long terminal repeat (LTR) regulatory sequences from Rous sarcoma virus, and gene transfer was accomplished by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Transfected cells were fractionated on Ficoll 400 density gradients. The major finding of this study was that the larger, more differentiated cells displayed five- to seven-fold higher levels of CAT activity per cell than the smaller, less differentiated cells. The higher levels of CAT activity did not result from greater uptake of DNA because cells of all gradient fractions contained one to two copies of plasmid DNA per cell. Furthermore, the CAT gene linked to the regulatory sequences from another virus, SV40, gave the same result. We conclude that the CAT gene, when controlled by these viral regulatory sequences, is expressed more efficiently in differentiated keratinocytes. These results have important implications for the interpretation of future studies of gene expression in transfected keratinocytes.\r"

The intact whole follicles remained viable and regenerated whiskers which were later shed. The lower one-half or one-third follicle implants reorganized their base and produced a short, curled whisker. On the other hand, none of the upper one-half or two-thirds implants regenerated a dermal papilla, and no whisker production was observed. However, when a single dermal papilla which had been dissected out from another follicle was introduced into each upper follicle cavity in contact with the cut edge, a bulbar region emerged, and subsequently, a long, thick, medullated whisker developed from the implants. This technique should be useful in studying the induction and regeneration of adult mouse whiskers.\r"

  ".U": "89140398\r", 
  ".W": "Serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) is believed to be responsible for the transport of retinol from its storage site in the liver to vitamin A requiring target cells such as keratinocytes. We have used primary mouse keratinocytes as a model system to compare the uptake and metabolism of [3H] retinol delivered to them either free in solution or bound to RBP. RBP was purified from rat serum, loaded with [3H]retinol, and the [3H]retinol-RBP complex purified by affinity chromatography on human transthyretin-Sepharose. Keratinocytes incubated with either free [3H]retinol or [3H]retinol-RBP complex accumulated [3H]retinol in a time and temperature dependent manner. However, cells incubated with free [3H]retinol acquired 15- to 20-fold more ligand than if the retinol was delivered via RBP. The uptake of free [3H]retinol or [3H]retinol from RBP was not inhibited by excess unlabeled free retinol. The uptake of [3H]retinol from RBP was inhibited by high concentrations of holo-RBP, with half maximal inhibition occurring at 3 microM holo-RBP. However, no specific binding of 125I-labeled RBP to monolayers of keratinocytes or membranes prepared from them was found indicating the absence of a high affinity RBP receptor on keratinocytes. Surprisingly, 50% of the [3H]retinol delivered to the keratinocytes during a 30-min uptake period was released from them within 30-min irrespective of whether or not it was initially delivered to them as free [3H]retinol or bound to RBP. The remaining 50% was lost at a much slower rate, but only 20% remained 24-h after delivery. Studies on retinol metabolism demonstrated that 7%-12% of the total cell-associated [3H]retinol delivered during a 90-min uptake period was esterified (mostly as retinyl palmitate) whether or not it was given free in solution or bound to RBP. Additionally, [3H]retinol taken up by the keratinocytes during the initial 90-min incubation was not chased into a stable retinyl ester pool in a subsequent 9.5-h incubation, but instead, retinyl ester was lost from the cells with kinetics similar to those of total cell-associated radioactivity. These results suggest that a function of RBP is to protect cells from a rapid accumulation of the vitamin which occurs when it is delivered free in solution. However, the cellular fate and metabolism of retinol appears to be the same whether the vitamin is delivered free in solution or bound to RBP.\r"

Mast cells in clinically involved skin showed a wide morphologic spectrum including evidence of cellular activation. There was an increased amount of cytoplasm occupied by polysomes and mitochondria and less cytoplasm occupied by granules. Most granules were pale and swollen, suggesting active degranulation. In some cases it was difficult to distinguish a hyperactive mast cell with only a few granules remaining from a fibroblast which had acquired granules by transgranulation. This case illustrates the active participation of mast cells in acute scleroderma.\r"

Sections of skin biopsies from eight scleroderma patients were investigated using specific antibodies to TGF alpha, TGF beta, human PDGF, and sis-onc products for immunohistochemistry. Most significantly, deposition of PDGF was detected in the endothelial lining of small capillaries in association with certain mononuclear cells of the perivascular infiltrates. In particular, strong labeling was observed in the cytoplasm of macrophages. Smooth muscle also appeared to be specifically labeled. Similarly, sis-onc product localized in the same areas. No significant staining was observed with antibodies to TGF alpha. TGF beta was found rather diffusely throughout the dermal connective tissue and was only occasionally observed in capillaries of lesions. We conclude that the PDGF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of scleroderma.\r"

To study minoxidil's action on isolated follicles we developed and validated an organ culture system using mouse whisker follicles. Control follicles cultured without minoxidil showed macroscopic changes including kinking of the hair shafts and bending of the follicles. Necrosis was evident in the differentiating epithelial elements forming the cuticle, cortex, and inner root sheath. These abnormalities were eliminated or greatly reduced in minoxidil-treated follicles. The morphology of these follicles was consistent with the production of new hair during culture. Direct measurement demonstrated that minoxidil-treated follicles grew significantly longer than control follicles during the 3-d culture. Minoxidil increased the incorporation of radiolabeled cysteine and glycine in follicles compared with control treatment. Doses of minoxidil up to 1 mM caused increased cysteine incorporation, while higher doses were inhibitory. Experiments with labeled thymidine indicated that minoxidil induced proliferation of hair epithelial cells near the base of the follicle. Autoradiography also showed that cysteine accumulated in the keratogenous zone above the dermal papilla. These studies demonstrate that organ cultured follicles are suitable for determining minoxidil's mechanism of action and may be useful for studying other aspects of hair biology. The results also show that minoxidil's effect on hair follicles is direct. This suggests that minoxidil's action in vivo includes more than just increasing blood flow to hair follicles.\r"

Morphometric analysis showed a reduction of up to 75% in mean volume of meibomian acinar tissue from animals fed a high dose of 13-cis-retinoic acid. Clinical observations in these animals included alopecia and weight loss. Ocular complications included crusting of the eyelid margin and the external surface of the lid and erythema of the conjunctiva. The model supports previous observations by the authors that systemic 13-cis-retinoic acid affects meibomian gland structure in a laboratory animal. The ocular side effects described in this model suggest that future functional studies may yield important insights into the complex relationship between meibomian gland morphology and function, and events on the ocular surface.\r"

In this study, the epidermal content and localization of hyaluronate (HA), as well as its synthesis and disappearance in human skin organ culture, were characterized to test the idea that some of the RA influences on epidermal differentiation are associated with keratinocyte HA metabolism. RA stimulated the incorporation of 3H-glucosamine into HA by up to 60% at concentrations between 50 nM and 5 microM, while pulse-chase experiments revealed little change in its disappearance rate from epidermis. After 5 d in culture, the chemically quantified HA was more than doubled in the treated epidermis. The accumulation of HA was substantiated by light and electron microscopy with a specific probe prepared from the HA binding region of cartilage proteoglycan. The staining was particularly enhanced between the upper spinous cell layers, where the terminal differentiation into corneocytes normally takes place. A patchy, discontinuous staining was also seen in stratum granulosum and corneum layers, which are not stained at all in control cultures. The present study demonstrates that RA leads to an accumulation of HA in the superficial layers of epidermis by stimulating its synthesis in keratinocytes. This may account for the delay in terminal differentiation, and the weakened cohesion of the keratinocytes previously observed both in vivo and vitro.\r"

The wax ester, cholesterol ester, triglyceride, and free fatty acid classes were isolated from each sample and the fatty acid compositions were determined by capillary gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) prepared from each lipid class.

For the majority of straight chain fatty acid types, the data could be fitted to the equation y = a + b/[x + 1], which can be derived from simple assumptions concerning the origins of the various sebum components. The FAME from the wax esters were separated into saturated and monounsaturated fractions and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography to determine the concentrations of the different types of branched chain FAME present. In the wax esters, straight chain fatty acids tended to increase with increasing WE/[CH + CE], while terminally branched (iso and anteiso) fatty acids tended to decrease.

This activity (referred to as PK-II because it was the second peak of protein kinase activity eluted from a DEAE column) was partially purified from the supernatant of an epidermal homogenate by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Although histone was not a substrate for phosphorylation, in the presence of histone, endogenous proteins of Mr 105 and 95 kDa were phosphorylated. Activity was not affected by Ca2+/phospholipid, cAMP, cGMP, cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor, spermine, spermidine, calmodulin, EGF, or phorbol ester. Phosphorylation was specific for serine and threonine residues. A major peak of PK-II activity eluted from sepharose 6B with an apparent Mr of 100 kDa, suggesting that histone may stimulate autophosphorylation. The properties of PK-II resemble those recently described for a class of polypeptide-dependent protein kinases isolated from placenta, Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, and bakers' yeast. PK-II was significantly higher in psoriatic involved epidermis (32.6 +/- 11.6 pmol/min/mg protein) compared to psoriatic uninvolved epidermis (5.7 +/- 0.6 pmol/min/mg; p = 0.03) and normal epidermis (9.5 +/- 2.2 pmol/min/mg; p = 0.05). The function of histone stimulated protein kinase in epidermal function and its role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis remain to be explored.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary experience of the efficacy and safety of a new regenerating system for selective extracorporeal removal of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins is described. Four patients with familial hyperlipoproteinaemia were studied on 10 occasions. A system of two, parallel, dextran sulphate cellulose columns was used, and plasma was processed continuously by passage through one of the columns while the other was being regenerated. With this procedure, reductions of very low density and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 73 and 43%, respectively, could be achieved after treatment for 2.5-3 h (1000-3200 ml of plasma volume). No clinically relevant changes in the concentrations of other plasma proteins, including high density lipoproteins, were observed, and the treatment was well tolerated. We conclude that continuous selective apolipoprotein B apheresis is a safe and efficient lipid-lowering procedure which may be used both for metabolic investigations and for studies on possible regression of atherosclerosis.\r"

Two patients, whose multifocal bone granulomas appeared with a frequency of about 6 months, received 1.6 g day-1 oral clodronate for 6 months. Both patients had a reduction in serum calcium level which was accompanied by a decline in the fasting urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine and calcium/creatinine ratios and a slight increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Pain relief was observed in both patients. No new bone lesions were seen during the treatment and the old lesions healed. After discontinuing the therapy, however, new painful lesions appeared after 5 years in patient 1 and after 3, 4 and 5 years in patient 2. We suppose that clodronate delayed the appearance of new granulomas.\r"

Low serum potassium values (less than 3.6 mmol l) occurred in 7% of the CCU patients and low serum magnesium values (less than 0.70 mmol l-1) in 6%. Few patients had low values of both these ions (1.9%). In 49 patients the contents of these electrolytes in muscle biopsies were similar to the values of control subjects and were unrelated to treatment with diuretics. Serum calcium was determined in 444 of the patients and was above the reference range in 11 (2.5%). If we consider their concomitant parathyroid hormone (PTH) values, primary hyperparathyroidism was likely to occur in at least seven patients (1.5%). Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had mean PTH and electrolyte values similar to those of individuals without this disease. In conclusion, the present study indicates that clinically important disturbances of magnesium, potassium or calcium homeostasis are rare among unselected patients admitted to a CCU.\r"

Mean times of detection of the last positive specimen (greater than or equal to 300 ng/mL of benzoylecgonine equivalents) after cocaine administration varied among seven of the commercial tests from 16.9 to 52.9 h in the following ascending order: Toxi-Lab less than TDx = EMIT dau = EMIT st less than Abuscreen less than Coat-A-Count = Double Antibody. In contrast, a commercial spot test (KDI Quik Test) which was evaluated for detection of cocaine metabolite produced both false positives and false negatives for benzoylecgonine and was not considered to be a valid test for detection of cocaine metabolite. Half-lives of excretion of benzoylecgonine among four subjects varied from 5.9 to 7.9 h, and overall recovery of benzoylecgonine varied from 15.0 to 34.3% of the administered dose of cocaine.\r"

Statistical tests for clustering of fatal and nonfatal overdoses during this interval identified 7 heroin-related deaths that occurred on March 1 to 2 as a statistically significant cluster (p = 0.007). An extension of the analysis for clustering to a 15-month period identified 2 additional clusters, 1 of fatal overdoses and 1 of nonfatal ones. When all victims of fatal overdose in cluster intervals were combined and compared with all other heroin-related deaths, no significant differences were noted for levels of morphine or ethanol in blood. However, bile morphine concentrations of cluster decedents were significantly lower than those of noncluster decedents (p = 0.033), suggesting that these decedents were less tolerant to the effects of narcotics than the comparison group. Heroin concentrations in street-level heroin samples collected during clusters did not differ from those collected during comparison intervals. These data conflict with the traditional explanation of overdose clusters, which attributes these events to unusually potent street-level heroin.\r"

A number of objective chemical methods for determining PMI have been developed, the most widely used being accumulation of potassium in the vitreous humor. The authors previously have reported a chemical method for determining PMI from the predictable accumulation or clearance of the dopaminergic metabolite 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) in the putamen of the brain. They have extended their previous study to compare directly the accuracy of determining PMI from the level of 3-MT in putamen with the level of potassium in vitreous humor. The data indicate that 3-MT is at least as accurate as, if not more accurate than, potassium accumulation in vitreous humor, although 3-MT levels can be affected by the cause of death and drugs present at the time of death. Nevertheless, determination of both the 3-MT and potassium levels can afford the most accurate method of determining PMI; preliminary nomograms for determining PMI from both variables are presented.\r"

Using the kinetics of C3 cleavage in vitro described as dC/dt = -kC, where C is the concentration of native C3 at time t and k is a first-order rate constant, Arrhenius' equation, and another equation which assumes a linear drop of body temperature after death, the percentages of C3 cleavage were calculated. There was a significant positive correlation between the calculated percentages and the measured percentages of up to 10% in cadaveric blood. We found that the comparison between the calculated percentage of C3 cleavage for each optional postmortem interval and the measured percentage of up to 10% in cadaveric blood leads to the estimation of PMI. This approach is one step towards the development of an accurate method for determining PMI based on C3 cleavage, that is, on a first-order reaction.\r"

Cocaine use may cause the development of psychosis, with subsequent expression of suicidal ideations, and potentially even successful suicide. Cocaine dependence may also cause depression in the individual who is unable to control his or her craving for the drug, and suicide may be perceived as the only solution to a desperate problem. Despite the dramatic escalation of cocaine abuse and the potential toxicity of this drug, there have been no reports within the United States of cocaine being used as the agent to accomplish a suicide. Herewith are reported three cases in which depression and desperation over cocaine dependence were the motivations for successful suicide, which was accomplished through the intravenous injection of cocaine to the point of death. True cocaine suicide is probably only identified through the presence of objective scene information that unequivocally proves suicidal intent, such as notes or letters which contain information to this effect. A careful search of the scene of death in cocaine fatalities is mandatory, and diligent application of routine scene investigation principles may reveal that suicide through the use of cocaine is more widespread than first appearances would suggest.\r"

After examining the data that are leading to the evaluation, these evaluations require corroborated background information to look for developmental and genetic antecedents that might be consistent with substance abuse and dependence; inquiry into the history of substance use; and an examination of areas, in which problems from substance use can occur, namely in family and other social relationships, at work, in legal settings, in physical health, and in personal and psychiatric reactions, for example, in suicidal behavior. Then a physical exam and laboratory evaluation are conducted to look for medical evidence of substance use and complications therefrom, and a mental status exam is performed and psychological testing is obtained as required, for example, a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) or neuropsychological testing. When such an evaluation is essentially negative, the examiner can say, within the limits of the evaluation, that a psychoactive substance use disorder does not exist.\r"

Changes demonstrated considerable evidence of acculturation, psychiatric care seeking, and greatly reduced symptom levels for several symptom complexes. However, a large minority of subjects remain illiterate, unable to speak English, generally involved with other Hmong but not with the majority society, and/or have high symptom levels on self-rating scales. Regarding symptom changes, depression, somatization, phobia, and self-esteem symptoms improved the most with time and acculturation. On the contrary, anxiety, hostility, and paranoid symptoms changed little. Multiple regression analyses indicated that strong traditional ties (e.g., large household size, being an herbal healer), older age, marital problems, and medical complaints were most associated with high symptom levels.\r"

Half these men satisfied DSM-III criteria for PTSD in the year following repatriation. Eighteen (29%) continued to meet the criteria for PTSD 40 years later. Family history of mental illness and preexisting psychopathology were at best only weakly correlated with persistent PTSD symptoms. The strongest predictors of PTSD were proportion of body weight lost and the experience of torture during captivity. This study demonstrates that former POWs frequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder and that for one half of those who develop the symptoms, they persist for over 40 years. Familial risk factors and preexisting psychopathology are superseded by the overwhelming nature of the trauma. The persistence of the symptoms for many years is a reflection of the severity of the trauma.\r"

In addition, the most recent nocturnal panic was rated on measures of intensity, duration, and circumstances. Nocturnal panic occurred in individuals who were equally avoidant and distressed as individuals who did not experience nocturnal panic. However, nocturnal panickers experienced daytime panics and general somatic sensations more frequently than other panickers. The similarity of nocturnal panic to sleep apnea, dream-induced anxiety attacks, and night terrors is discussed.

Using Cox's proportional hazards model with a time-dependent covariate representing the local recurrence of the tumor, it was found that local recurrence is significantly associated with a shorter survival time (estimated relative risk (relative hazard) = 2.5, p less than 0.0001). The estimated 5 yr survival rate and median survival time for patients without a local recurrence were 44% and 42 months, respectively, while the corresponding figures for patients with a local recurrence were only 26% and 28 months. Hence, a local recurrence resulted in a relative decline in the estimated 5 yr survival rate of 41%. This strong relationship continued to hold even after adjusting for several other important, time-independent prognostic variables (stage, type of surgery, type of resection, signs of sarcomatous skin invasion, and presence of postoperative fever) in a multivariable analysis. Local control of high-grade soft tissue sarcomas is vitally important for successful management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although most clinicians agree that patients should be informed about treatment alternatives, little is known about the way patients perceive probabilistic information about treatment outcomes and how it influences the choices they make. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of level and framing of probability on preferences for cancer treatment alternatives in which tradeoffs between quantity and quality of life are made. 129 healthy volunteers and 154 cancer patients indicated their preferences for a toxic treatment over a non-toxic treatment at varying survival probabilities. Subjects responded to questions in one of three randomly assigned conditions: (1) a positive frame in which the probability of survival was given; (2) a negative frame in which the probability of dying was given; and (3) a mixed frame in which the probability of surviving and dying were both given. The cancer patients' preferences for the more effective toxic treatment was significantly stronger than the healthy volunteers. Both groups were significantly influenced by the level of probability that was presented. Preferences for the toxic treatment were weaker when the chance of survival dropped below 50%. This weakening preference below 50% survival was enhanced for subjects who responded in the negative frame. A negative frame or probability level below 0.5 would seem to stimulate a \"dying mode\" type of value system in which quality of life becomes more salient in decision making than quantity of life. The implications in eliciting informed consent from patients are discussed.\r"

In a life-table analysis, complications (severe events) developed in about 1% per year of patients with visualized gallstones and in about 2% per year of patients with nonfunction. During each of the first 5 years after diagnosis, all events, both severe and non-severe (including surgery for continuing mild symptoms) occurred in about 6% of the patients with mild symptoms accompanying either gallstones or nonfunction, and in about 4% of patients with asymptomatic gallstones. The annual probabilities for all events tended to decrease as length of follow-up increased. Among patients with stones and mild symptoms, women were more apt to develop any event than men (p = 0.02) and more obese patients were more likely to develop severe events than those who were thinner (p = 0.05). The patients in this study are probably more representative of outpatients with gallstones seen by most primary care physicians than are most groups investigated previously for prognosis. Their event rates are sufficiently similar to those used in published decision analyses, that they should not alter previous conclusions that early elective cholecystectomy will have little positive or negative effect on average life expectancy of patients with gallstones.\r"

  ".U": "89140909\r", 
  ".W": "An increasingly common public health problem is the perception that disease incidence has increased or a cluster of disease has occurred in a community. In most cases, the disease of concern is cancer and a local hazardous waste site or other environmental problem is involved. These problems can be difficult to investigate and public health officials are frequently criticized for their inability to address community concerns. This paper reports a case study of such a situation occurring in the Barlett-Green Acres (BGA) neighborhood of Randolph, Massachusetts. Study data were obtained by interviews in households of persons belonging to a list of alleged cancer cases initially supplied by residents and supplemented using records available in town and state public health offices. One objective of the investigation was to develop methods that may be of value in similar situations arising in other communities. From a list of names compiled prior to and during the investigation, 45 incident cases of cancer were identified and found suitable for analysis. An additional four cases were added from the Massachusetts Cancer Registry. The analysis showed the existence of a cancer cluster, but overall cancer incidence and mortality in the BGA neighborhood were not elevated. Residence history, disease site, and other features of the cancer cases were investigated using methods less sensitive to incomplete reporting than total incidence. No unusual features of the cancer data other than the initiating cluster were identified and no environmental hazard likely to impact the BGA neighborhood was discovered, hence we conclude that the most likely cause of the cancer cluster was random variation in cancer rates.\r"

  ".W": "Using data from 5489 cancer patients and 2647 patients without cancer we investigated whether parental age at the birth of the patient or the patient's rank within his sibship was related to the risk of cancer during adulthood. An increase of 10 years in maternal age was associated with an increase of 24% for the incidence of breast cancer (odds ratio = 1.24%; 95% CI = 1.09-1.41); the corresponding increase for paternal age was 19% (odds ratio = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.07-1.33). There was some evidence that the age of each parent may make an independent contribution to the risk of breast cancer. For certain types of genito-urinary cancers, the risk was higher when the parents were relatively young at the birth of the patient. These cancers included tumors arising in the prostate (odds ratios = 0.71 and 0.55 for maternal and paternal ages, respectively), testis (odds ratios = 0.57 and 0.52), penis (odds ratios = 0.37 and 0.45), kidney (odds ratios = 0.66 and 0.60), and bladder (odds ratio = 0.79 and 0.85). The associations for cancer of the prostate and bladder were stronger among patients who were diagnosed at a relatively young age. No statistically significant effects were found for birth order relative to adult cancers. The authors conclude that environmental factors that affect the parents or that operate in the perinatal period may have stronger influences on the incidence of adult cancers than have been previously recognized.\r"

Median survival for the epidemiologic series was 35-42 years, with no finer estimate possible. Observed survival was 3/5 expected survival after 35 years of illness. Survival in this series was similar to that from two other population-based reports. No significant difference was found between the sexes, though patients with onset at age 35 + had a significantly shorter survival than those with onset at age under 35 years. The much larger hospital series, where median survival was 30 years, demonstrated significant differences separately favoring females and young onsets. However, the ratios of observed to expected survival from population life tables were strikingly similar among all four subgroups defined by sex and age at onset. While overall there is a substantial reduction in the expectation of life in MS, the differential survival by sex and age appears to be a reflection of the expected survival by sex and age per se, and not that of the disease.\r"

Among these men, 151 cases of definite CHD occurred early (under age 60) and 135 cases occurred later in life (age 60 and over). Serum triglyceride was the only risk factor that was an independent predictor of early onset disease and not of late onset disease. While cigarette smoking was a predictor for both onset groups, the effect of smoking was greater in people who developed CHD earlier in life. Systolic blood pressure, alcohol intake, serum cholesterol and serum glucose were independent predictors for both onset groups, with no difference in effect between groups. The findings indicate that it is possible for some factors to affect CHD risk differently in terms of premature vs delayed onset of disease. The findings for serum triglyceride may account for some of the inconsistencies in reports regarding it as an independent risk factor for CHD. In general, however, most of the characteristics studied here had a similar effect on both early and late onset and thus remain important in the prevention of both premature and late onset of CHD.\r"

  ".W": "A phase I trial of intramuscularly administered recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) was conducted in 19 adult patients with advanced solid tumors. The agent was administered daily for up to five consecutive days every other week for two to four courses. Doses of rTNF ranged from 5 to 200 micrograms/m2/d. Dose-limiting toxicities were encountered at doses greater than 100 micrograms/m2/d. Toxicities included tenderness, erythema and induration at the site of injection, fatigue, fever, chills, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Moderate to marked reductions in WBC and platelet counts were observed regularly at the highest dose levels, but none were clinically significant. Hepatic enzyme elevation was seen frequently, and two patients developed hyperbilirubinemia. Only one of seven patients treated with doses greater than 100 micrograms/m2/d completed the planned course of therapy. Even at the highest dose levels, serum concentrations of rTNF could only rarely be detected in the serum. No therapeutic responses were observed. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of rTNF in this trial was 150 micrograms/m2/d, administered for two courses.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed an assay for the detection of malignant residual cells in the bone marrow from patients with B- or T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in clinical remission. This assay involves an immune selection step followed by immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis and allows the detection of one contaminating tumor cell out of 1,000 normal bone marrow cells. We have examined the bone marrow of 11 patients with adult ALL in remission over a 24-month period. Five patients relapsed in the bone marrow and one in the CNS. The assay allowed the detection of minimal residual disease in four of five patients that subsequently relapsed in the bone marrow, 1.5 to 9 months before the relapse became morphologically and clinically manifest. Residual disease was not found in the bone marrow from patients in continuous remission and from the single patient who relapsed in the CNS. We conclude that the ability of the assay described here to detect minimal residual disease with high specificity can provide information for further understanding of the biology of ALL and hopefully for the clinical management of patients with this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) accrued 1,745 patients with limited (LD) or extensive (ED) small-cell lung cancer (SCCL) to five separate trials between 1972 and 1986. We reviewed these data to evaluate the impact of pretreatment prognostic factors on outcome. In multivariate analysis, female gender was predictive of improved response (LD, P = .01; ED, P = .04) and survival (LD, P = .01; ED, P = .02). A performance status of 0 or 1 was associated with improved response rates in both subsets, but was statistically significant (P = .04) only for overall objective response in LD patients. Performance status was a highly significant predictor of survival in both LD and ED groups (P less than .001). Supraclavicular lymph node involvement, while still LD, had a borderline unfavorable impact on survival (P = .06) compared with a lesser extent of LD involvement. In ED patients, a decrease in survival rates was associated with an increased number of metastatic sites (P = .01). Changes in the patient population were noted with time: the percentage of women increased from 21% to greater than 35%; an increased number of metastatic sites was identified among ED patients; mean performance status improved for both LD and ED subsets. These trends reflect the changing demographics of lung cancer, improved lung cancer staging, and probably lead-time bias. Response rates, overall survival, and long-term (greater than 2-year) survival varied significantly among the five protocols, both before and after multivariate correction for identified prognostic variables. However, the changing character of the study population limits the ability to determine retrospectively how much improvements in therapy contributed to the positive changes in failure-free survival, overall survival, and long-term survival observed in our sequentially studied population.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to investigate the long-term survival and the probability of \"cure\" in a group of 644 patients treated by mastectomy for T1 breast carcinoma. After a median follow-up of 18.2 years, 23% were dead of recurrent breast carcinoma, 3% were alive with recurrent disease, and 74% had not experienced a recurrence. The probability of recurrence was directly related to the initial extent of the disease. Overall, 16% of recurrences and 25% of deaths due to disease occurred in the second decade of follow-up. The proportion of recurrences detected in the second decade was inversely related to the stage of the primary tumor at diagnosis. When stratified by tumor size, T1N0M0 patients with tumors 1.0 cm or less in diameter had a significantly better 20-year recurrence-free survival (86%) than did T1N0M0 patients with tumors 1.1 to 2.0 cm (69%). When observed and expected survival curves were compared by the method of Brinkley and Haybittle, it appeared that 80% of T1N0M0 patients with tumors 1 cm or less might be cured at 20 years, whereas for those in the 1.1- to 2-cm group, the proportion cured was indeterminate, but might be as high as 70%. A potentially cured group could not be identified among T1N1M0 patients, but an estimated 52% of these patients did not have a recurrence within the nearly 20-year follow-up period. These data are important when one considers the proper role of adjuvant therapy for stage I disease. Patients with tumors larger than 1 cm and those with axillary lymph node metastases may have an improved recurrence-free survival as a result of systemic adjuvant treatment, while women in the T1N0M0 group with an especially favorable recurrence-free survival, particularly those with tumors 1 cm in diameter or smaller, might be spared adjuvant therapy.\r"

Between 1984 and 1987, 98 stage I and II breast cancer patients were entered onto a behavioral study in Pittsburgh, approximately 70% of whom elected to have breast conservation surgery. Patients at both sites were assessed three to five days postsurgery, and again at 3-month's follow-up, using a well-validated mood measure, the Profile of Mood States (POMS). There were no demographic or disease differences between the two samples. In the Pittsburgh sample, using a repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) analysis, after adjusting for menopausal status and radiotherapy and chemotherapy toxicity, the conservation group was psychologically worse off (F = 2.7, P less than .03). For example, they were significantly more distressed over time (F = 5.5, P less than .02), and more depressed in general (F = 9.2, P less than .005). Using Karnofsky ratings, the two groups were identical in terms of disability at 3-month's follow-up. In contrast, for the NCI patients participating in the randomized trial, after adjusting for chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments, reported overall distress decreased over time (F = 17.4, P less than .0001) for all patients, irrespective of treatment group, and the between-groups MANCOVA was not significant. Thus, when comparing the two samples, when \"choice\" played a major role, the conservation patients were psychologically worse off--at least at 3-month's follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In an effort to provide long-term follow-up information, we evaluated retrospectively a group of 17 patients treated without mastectomy. Thirteen patients were treated with local excision, while four received excision and postoperative radiotherapy. Median follow-up is 100 months, with minimum follow-up 78 months. Five patients (29%) have recurred locally, at a median of 47 months following initial therapy. Three of the local recurrences were invasive carcinomas; two were DCIS. The patients recurring with invasive carcinoma progressed to disseminated disease and death, at a median of 131 months following their local recurrence. Of the eight patients followed for more than 9 years, four (50%) have recurred. Two patients have developed contralateral breast cancer, both treated by mastectomy. No recurrences have occurred in the group receiving radiotherapy. We conclude that long-term follow-up is required to accurately assess local recurrence rates in this disease, and that many recurrences will be invasive carcinomas. Since this lesion is virtually 100% curable by mastectomy, further analysis of long-term studies is warranted before recommending breast conservation to the majority of patients with DCIS.\r"

A retrospective review (1977 to 1986) identified 89 patients, 59 (66%) of whom had tumors originating in the colon, and 19 (21%) in the stomach. Normal bowel function was restored for a median of 102 days in 66 patients (74%) and all but four (94%) were discharged. Forty-one (46%) patients remained unobstructed until death. Twenty-three (26%) were not relieved by operation and died a median of 33 days later (P less than .005). Forty-eight (81.4%) of the 59 colon cancer patients and ten (52.6%) of 19 with gastric cancer (P less than .05) were benefited by the operation, although comparison of duration of function was less striking (P less than .1). In-hospital mortality was 13% and complications occurred in 44%. Obstruction recurred in 38% of those relieved by the initial operation. Normal bowel function was restored in six (46%) of 13 patients undergoing a second laparotomy (median, 158 days) and in six of 13 (46%) treated with nasogastric suction. Obstruction recurred again in four of the latter six patients (median, 39 days). Hospitalization averaged 31 days (median, 25 days) for the first procedure and 41 days (median, 39 days) for patients operated for recurrent obstruction. These results justify laparotomy for intestinal obstruction in known or suspected carcinomatosis, particularly of colonic origin, if performance status is compatible with a reasonable quality of life.\r"

All patients had received previous chemotherapy, and 50% of patients had received more than one combination regimen. When given for 21 consecutive days, the maximum-tolerated dose of oral VP-16 was 50 mg/m2/d. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxicity, and occurred between days 21 and 28. In most patients, blood counts had recovered sufficiently by day 35 to begin another 3-week course. WBC count nadirs of less than 1,000/microL occurred in four of 20 courses at this dose, and three patients required hospitalization for treatment of neutropenia and fever. Alopecia occurred in most patients; gastrointestinal (GI) and other toxicities were uncommon. Five of 16 patients with measurable tumor had partial responses of 3 to 4 months duration. Four of these five patients had malignancies that are usually unresponsive to VP-16 when administered by previously investigated schedules. This method of VP-16 administration is well tolerated, convenient, and may optimize antitumor efficacy by exploiting the schedule dependency of this drug. Phase II studies are necessary to define the level of activity of this schedule of VP-16.\r"

The specific activity of 5'-nucleotidase in n-3 PUFA-enriched hepatic plasma membranes was 1.6- to 2-fold higher than that in rats fed CNO or corn oil (CO). Lineweaver-Burk plots for 5'-nucleotidase in liver plasma membranes isolated from rats fed MO and CNO showed no significant differences in Km values but the Vmax was increased by 67% in MO-fed rats. Arrhenius plots showed a break point in 5'-nucleotidase activity at 28.3 degrees C and 30.8 degrees C in plasma membranes from MO- and CNO-fed rats, respectively. The implications of this in the generation of adenosine and its possible impact on physiological functions are discussed.\r"

Starvation-refeeding increased G6PDH level above that seen in ad libitum-fed animals (enzyme overshoot). A second episode of starvation-refeeding produced even higher levels of G6PDH activity (induction increment). Interposing a high fat diet (containing PUFA) between starvation and feeding the inducer diet abolished one-half to two-thirds of the overshoot. Feeding a high fat diet between the two starvations abolished the induction increment. Inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism were not able to reverse the PUFA effect. In another set of experiments it was shown that both linoleic and linolenic acid are equally effective in either reducing the overshoot or abolishing the induction increment. The evidence was interpreted as supporting a hypothesis that the PUFA effect does not require the formation of a specific end product of arachidonic metabolism in a direct way.\r"

During the absorptive period, plasma ammonia, plasma amino acids and brain amino acids were measured on d 1 and d 7 after feeding ammonium acetate. Food intake of rats fed 15% ammonium acetate was depressed on d 1 and increased to approximately 75% of the intake of the 6% casein-fed group by d 7. On d 1 plasma ammonia of the rats fed 5% ammonium acetate was 101 microM as compared to 56 microM for the rats fed 6% casein (P less than 0.05). On d 7, plasma ammonia of the rats fed 15% ammonium acetate was 240 microM (P less than 0.05) as compared to 44 microM for the rats fed 6% casein. In rats fed 15% ammonium acetate, after 7 d ornithine transcarbamylase and arginase activities were higher and argininosuccinate synthetase activity was lower (P less than 0.05) while carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity tended to be higher than that of rats fed 6% casein. The results suggest that rats adapt to ingestion of 15% ammonium acetate by some unknown neural mechanism rather than by increases in all urea cycle enzyme activities. Feeding ammonium acetate causes changes in plasma, brain and liver amino acid concentrations.\r"

In excess of 500 micrograms phylloquinone/kg diet was needed to prevent the most sensitive signs of vitamin K deficiency. Liver phylloquinone concentrations were shown to be correlated with dietary phylloquinone intake. Serum phylloquinone was not correlated with either diet or liver concentration of phylloquinone and did not increase with increased dietary intake until the liver contained sufficient vitamin to maintain optimal synthesis of vitamin K-dependent proteins. Because of the rapid loss of vitamin from the liver, prior ingestion of a high level of vitamin K had little influence on liver vitamin K concentrations beyond the first 2 d of a deficient period. When rats consumed a diet containing 500 micrograms phylloquinone/kg diet in 3 h, liver and serum phylloquinone concentrations fluctuated drastically following this feeding period. During the subsequent 24-h period, liver phylloquinone concentrations decreased to a level that would not support maximal activity of the hepatic vitamin K-dependent carboxylase.\r"

  ".W": "In previous work identification of urinary metabolites of 4'-deoxypyridoxine which had been oxidized in the 5'-position and long-term dilution of labeled urinary metabolites with unlabeled molecules suggested possible microbial contributions. In the current studies germfree guinea pigs were able to convert 4'-deoxypyridoxine to 4'-deoxy-5-pyridoxic acid demonstrating that the ability to oxidize the 5'-position is not restricted to microorganisms. Labelling curves for urinary pyridoxic acid in rats continuously fed [14C]pyridoxine since weaning were similar in conventional and germfree animals indicating that any vitamin B-6 synthesized in the intestinal tract was not readily absorbed and metabolized. Therefore, coprophagy did not make a detectable contribution to vitamin B-6 metabolism in rats receiving a nutritionally complete diet. The difficulty in achieving comparable labeling in adult animals is probably due to very slow turnover of portions of the vitamin B-6 pool and not to microbial production of vitamin B-6. The total pool calculated from the radioactivity in the germ-free rats averaged 16.2 +/- 0.8 nmol vitamin B-6 compounds/g body wt. Only 10% of the ingested label was recovered in the feces. In addition, only about 50% of the label excreted in the urine appeared as 4-pyridoxic acid in rats. These observations suggest that it may be difficult to quantitate the total urinary and fecal excretion of ingested vitamin B-6 without using tracers.\r"

Its structure was tentatively identified as adenosine-N6-methyl, propylthioether-N-pyridoximine-5'-phosphate. In the present study, 3B3 mouse-human hybridoma cells were incubated with radiolabeled precursor molecules, perchloric acid cell extracts were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and radioactivity in effluent fractions was measured. The results show that [G-3H]pyridoxine, [2,8-3H]adenosine, L-[35S]cysteine and L-[U-14C]serine are incorporated into the novel tumor product. These findings are interpreted to indicate that the correct structure of the novel product is adenosine-N6-diethylthioether-N'-pyridoximine-5'-phosphate. Further, these data demonstrate that tumor cells have evolved novel enzymatic steps for metabolism of vitamin B-6. The potential use of the novel metabolite as a marker for tumor genesis and establishment is especially significant, as the compound is peculiar to the neoplastic state.\r"

When severe signs of deficiency developed, tissues were analyzed for their zinc content to assess sites of depletable and mobilizable zinc stores. Weanling guinea pigs were fed low (less than 1 mg/kg) and adequate (100 mg/kg) zinc diets based on isolated soybean protein or autoclaved egg white. The first signs (stage 1) of vocalization due to handling, abnormal posture and skin lesions developed after approximately 4 wk. Severe (stage 3) signs followed after 5-6 wk. A single IP dose of ZnSO4 (50 mumol/kg) caused remission of signs within 4-5 d following which all signs regressed to stage 3 within 7 d. Analysis of 15 tissues from severely deficient guinea pigs showed that only plasma and bone had significantly lower zinc concentrations than tissues from comparable age-related controls fed a zinc-adequate diet. It seems unlikely that major soft tissues, such as muscle, brain, liver and skin, serve as mobilizable stores of zinc for other critical metabolic functions. Bone zinc is slowly mobilized but at a rate insufficient to maintain health or even life.\r"

  ".W": "To further characterize the role of ferritin in regulating iron absorption, uptake of an oral dose of 59Fe (0.2 mg Fe/kg body wt.) into duodenal and hepatic ferritin of control and iron-deficient (ID) rats was studied. Retention and uptake of 59Fe from Fe(II)-sulfate, Fe(III)-chloride, or Fe(III)-polymaltose were measured up to 28 h after dosing. Ferritin was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and 59Fe ferritin-iron by gel electrophoresis. Retention and liver content of 59Fe was higher in ID rats than in controls. The mucosa of ID rats, however, retained only one third of the amount of 59Fe retained by the mucosa of controls. The mucosal and hepatic ferritin levels were lower in ID rats than in controls. The percentage of orally administered 59Fe found in the liver ferritin was therefore higher in control than in ID rats. However, when expressed as per unit of ferritin, iron uptake was eight times higher in ID rats. In contrast, mucosa ferritin of ID rats contained one-third of 59Fe per unit of ferritin than that of controls. Assuming no change in the mechanism of iron uptake into ferritin of control and ID rats, the differential uptake of oral iron into mucosa and liver ferritin indicates either a different compartmentation of the tissue ferritin or differences in the iron transport processes, but mucosal ferritin does not withdraw iron from intestinal absorption.\r"

We have prepared inositol triphosphate (IP-3), tetraphosphate (IP-4), pentaphosphate (IP-5) and hexaphosphate (IP-6) by hydrolysis of sodium phytate and separation by ion-exchange chromatography and have studied their effect on zinc and calcium absorption. Using a suckling rat pup model, we found that liver uptake of 65Zn after 6 h was 5% of the total dose from solutions of IP-6, 19% from IP-5, 28% from IP-4, 29% from IP-3 and 31% from ZnCl2 (control). Non-absorbed calcium was 17%, 1.4%, 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.5% of the given dose of 45Ca, respectively. Thus, at a high degree of phosphorylation (IP-6, IP-5), zinc and calcium uptake was inhibited, while no effect was observed for the other phosphates. Consequently, total \"phytate\" analysis, which includes inositol phosphates with varying degrees of phosphorylation, can give misleading information with regard to mineral availability. In addition, even limited dephosphorylation of inositol hexaphosphate can have a positive effect on mineral absorption.\r"

Mean GSH-Px activity (EC 1.11.1.9) in milk from vegetarians was 146% of that in milk from nonvegetarians. A significant correlation between GSH-Px activity and Se concentration was observed (r = 0.76). Likewise a significant correlation was observed between milk linoleic acid content and GSH-Px activity (r = 0.68). In undialyzed samples from vegetarian women, most of the increased content of Se was found in fractions containing proteins of 100 kdaltons (kD) or more. The high glutathione peroxidase activity in milk from vegetarians was associated with selenoproteins in the 90 to 100 kD range. A distinct 40 kD Se peak was also detected in milk from vegetarians. There was no difference in Se intake between the two groups of women. Therefore, although data from the present study show that both the quantity and distribution of Se in human milk can be modified by the maternal diet, the increased Se content and GSH-Px activity in milk from vegetarians cannot be explained by an increased Se intake.\r"

The mean hepatic Mo concentration increased significantly in the rats supplemented with 0.1 mg Mo/l as compared to the nonsupplemented rats, but a further significant increase did not occur until the supplementation level reached 5-10 mg Mo/l drinking water. Hepatic copper concentration of the group given 0.1 mg Mo/l and hepatic iron content of the groups given 0.1 or 0.5 mg Mo/l were significantly higher than those of the other groups. The hepatic xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase activity was not significantly affected by Mo supplementation. The hepatic sulfite oxidase (SOX) activity of the group given 0.1 mg Mo/l was significantly higher than that of the nonsupplemented group. The SOX activities of all the other supplemented groups were at a significantly different level intermediate between the first two. The hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly higher in the group given 0.1 mg/l than in the other groups. These results indicated that molybdenum enzymes and SOD might not be participants in previously reported anticarcinogenic activity of Mo, as supplementation at the level of 0.1 mg/l had been observed to be inefficacious in inhibiting N-nitrosomethylurea-induced mammary tumor incidence.\r"

The products were then labeled extrinsically with 47Ca and administered to rats by gavage. The 47Ca to 45Ca ratio in bone and teeth averaged about 1.00 with either milk, yogurt, or CaCl2, but the ratio was about 1.04 when dosed with cheese curd. Ca absorption, determined by whole-body counting of 47Ca, was lower (P less than 0.05) in cheese curd (59%) than in either milk (69%), yogurt (72%), or CaCl2 (72%). Expressed as percent of dose, the absorption of 47Ca was highly correlated with bone 47Ca (r = 0.973) and with bone 45Ca (r = 0.946). Correlation between tibia 47Ca and tibia 45Ca was r = 0.923. For the dairy products tested, our results indicated that extrinsic 47Ca was absorbed similarly to intrinsic 45Ca. Moreover, the percent of radioactive dose retained in bone appears to be a valid indicator of relative bioavailability of food Ca.\r"

Pectin supplementation resulted in larger cecal surface areas and longer large intestines than those of rats fed fiber-free or cellulose-supplemented diets. All high protein diets resulted in total large bowel luminal ammonia (NH3 + NH4+) concentrations that were twice as high as their low protein counterparts (P less than 0.05). The effect of fiber on ammonia concentration depended on the fiber type. In the distal colon, pectin-fed animals had three times the ammonia concentration of the fiber-free animals, and 4-5 times the ammonia concentration of the cellulose-fed animals (P less than 0.001). Blood urea nitrogen values were higher in the high protein than in the low protein groups (P less than 0.05), and highest in the high protein/pectin animals (P less than 0.01). This study clearly demonstrates that luminal ammonia concentration is dependent upon both protein level and fiber type, and that a fermentable fiber (pectin), rather than decreasing colonic ammonia concentrations, actually increases them several-fold.\r"

While dietary added choline had no effect, abomasally infused choline increased daily milk and 4% fat-corrected milk yield 3.2 and 3.8 kg/d respectively. In experiment 2, effect of daily abomasal infusion of 0, 30, 60 and 90 g choline were studied using four mature cows in a 4 X 4 Latin square design. Fat-corrected milk and milk fat percent were 2.6 kg/d and 0.59 percentage units higher for cows infused with 30 g/d choline than for unsupplemented controls, with 60 and 90 g/d choline infusions showing smaller effects. In experiment 3, daily abomasal infusion of 0 or 40 g choline were studied using four mature cows in a switchback design. Choline infusion (40 g/d) increased daily milk 1.6 kg/d over control while having no effect on milk composition or feed intake.

The ICR and C57BL strains of mice were more susceptible than the A/Jax strain to biotin deficiency. In rats, no malformations were seen in the fetuses from biotin-deficient dams. In hamsters, embryonic lethality was very high in biotin-deficient dams, and teratogenicity of biotin deficiency was rather equivocal. The results of measurements of the maternal and fetal biotin content suggest that a possible underlying mechanism is a difference in the efficiency of the mother-to-fetus transport of biotin among these species.\r"

Carnitine derived from neonatal de novo synthesis remained relatively constant from birth throughout the 20 d period, ranging from 26% in liver to 50% in the heart at d 0. The contribution from milk carnitine rose rapidly after birth until d 5, at which time it became relatively constant, ranging from 40.8% in heart to 55.4% in kidney at d 20. The fetus is a major contributor to its own tissue carnitine. Nevertheless, the infant rat is dependent upon external sources of carnitine in order to maintain tissue carnitine levels.\r"

The capacity for hippurate synthesis was not significantly affected by fat accumulation, but ureagenesis from saturating ammonia and ornithine was diminished about 50% in all models when fat content rose above 12% wet wt of liver. Pyrimidine biosynthesis under these conditions was similarly diminished with fat accumulation. Ureagenesis was inhibited by sodium benzoate in hepatocytes from lean livers, but not in hepatocytes from fatty livers. Other results suggest that higher rates of ureagenesis than could be achieved with the fatty liver are required in order to demonstrate inhibition by benzoate. Incorporation of [14C]NaHCO3 into orotate was also inhibited by sodium benzoate, but in hepatocytes from fatty as well as lean livers. The metabolic basis for impairment of ureagenesis and pyrimidine biosynthesis in the fatty liver requires further study. That the capacity for hippurate synthesis was not significantly affected suggests a pathway-specific mechanism.\r"

To determine the effect of a 72-h fast on lumenal glycolipids, specifically the monosialoganglioside GM1, we quantitated cholera toxin (CT) binding and adenylate cyclase activity. The calculated number of specific sites for CT binding to microvillus membrane (MVM) from newborn rabbits fasted for 72 h was decreased in MVM from proximal small bowel (7 +/- 0.8 x 10(8)/micrograms protein) compared to 72-h control neonatal rabbits (18 +/- 3.3 x 10(8) micrograms protein). In distal small bowel there was no difference in the calculated receptor sites/micrograms MVM protein between fasted (8 +/- 1.7 x 10(8)) and fed (11 +/- 4 x 10(8)) groups. MVM prepared from proximal small bowel of fed animals bound significantly more CT than MVM prepared from distal small bowel of fed animals. The affinity for CT was the same in all MVM preparations. Neuraminidase treatment of MVM resulted in increased CT binding in fed and fasted rabbit proximal and distal MVM preparations, but the greatest increase occurred in MVM prepared from proximal small bowel from fasted animals. There was no difference in adenylate cyclase activity in fed, fasted, and proximal or distal small bowel crude membrane preparations. Refeeding (120 h) resulted in normalization of CT binding in MVM from proximal small bowel of fasted animals. We conclude a 72-h fast in neonatal rabbits resulted in decreased regional CT binding in MVM prepared from proximal small bowel of fasted animals, but no change in adenylate cyclase activity. Refeeding reverses CT binding abnormalities.\r"

This activity is subject to long-term regulation by diet and changes in acid-base status. The activity is increased during starvation or metabolic acidosis. In addition, an unidentified component of some standard chicken diets results in altered activity. Using a specific cDNA probe the abundance of PEPCK mRNA has been determined in chicken kidney in vivo and in vitro. The abundance of PEPCK mRNA in chicken kidney increases during starvation and is rapidly decreased after refeeding carbohydrate. In isolated kidney tubules the abundance of the mRNA is increased after incubation with glucocorticoids, dibutyryl cAMP or hormones acting via changes in the concentration of cAMP (parathyroid hormone, epinephrine). Phorbol esters or hormones acting via calcium-dependent mechanisms were without effect. The results support the hypothesis that in the chicken the kidney is the major site of gluconeogenesis from substrates other than lactate and thus plays an important role in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has demonstrated antitumor activity against a variety of tumors and is particularly cytotoxic to capillary endothelial cells, which are the presumed cell of origin of Kaposi's sarcoma. We evaluated the toxicity and clinical antitumor and antiretroviral effects of recombinant TNF administered at a once weekly dose of 100 micrograms/m2 intravenously for 8 weeks in five men with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and without prior opportunistic infection. One patient was removed from study at week 4 due to rapid progression of Kaposi's sarcoma, another patient with stage IV disease and a pretreatment CD4 count of 11 developed fever, hypotension, and pneumonia at week 7 and died 8 days after discontinuing recombinant TNF. No pathogenic organisms were isolated. He had marked eschar formation of his Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, particularly in areas previously exposed to radiation therapy. Uniform toxicities included fevers, rigors, and headaches during drug infusion that were ameliorated by prophylactic meperidine hydrochloride and acetaminophen. All experienced fatigue and three had arthralgias. One patient had transient hypotension which corrected with i.v. fluids. No significant hematologic, hepatic, or renal toxicities were seen. All patients had some progression of their Kaposi's sarcoma on study. There was no change in CD4 or CD8 count or in CD4:CD8 ratios. Serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen levels increased greater than 50% in three patients. We conclude that, as a single agent, at a dose of 100 micrograms/m2 recombinant TNF by i.v. infusion has no obvious antitumor or antiretroviral effects in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.\r"

  ".W": "A cohort of 2915 HIV-1-seronegative men from the four centers of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) was followed at 6 month intervals for 24 months to identify men who developed antibodies to HIV-1. Two hundred thirty-two men (8%) seroconverted. The highest attack rate was among men who reported practicing both receptive and insertive anal-genital intercourse. The attack rate among men who reported practicing receptive but not insertive intercourse was 3.6 times higher than among men practicing insertive intercourse although those practicing insertive only reported 38% more different partners. Only two men seroconverted who reported not practicing analgenital intercourse in the 12 month prior to the first antibody-positive visit. Because men were followed every 6 months, one of these men could have been infected within 6 months of the actual development of HIV-1 antibodies. The seroconversion rate was significantly lower among men who reported using condoms with all their partners. The results of this study (a) reaffirm that receptive anal-genital intercourse is the major route of infection among homosexual men of HIV-1, (b) suggest that there is a low risk of HIV-1 infection to the insertive partner in anal-genital intercourse, (c) suggest that infection may rarely occur through sexual activities other than anal-genital intercourse, (d) provide evidence that condoms as currently used by men in the MACS provide significant but not complete protection against HIV-1 infection, and (e) suggest that the number of men in the homosexual community engaging in high-risk behavior is declining.\r"

This paper presents nonparametric analyses of conditional distribution of latency based on data from 1,206 persons who developed AIDS as a result of contaminated blood transfusions. Among persons who develop AIDS within 8 years of infection, there are no significant differences in the distributions of males and females. The conditional latency distribution of infants is significantly shorter than that of other transfusion cases, yet considerably longer than has previously been reported.\r"

  ".W": "During a 6-month period in 1987, we examined patients clinically suspected of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) at the national hospital in Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, and found 20 cases that fulfilled the criteria for AIDS. The two most prevalent major symptoms were weight loss and diarrhea, and the most common minor symptoms generalized lymphadenopathy and generalized dermatitis. Six of 20 patients died within a couple of months. Nineteen of 20 patients were tested for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) antibodies and were shown to be HIV-2 seropositive. During the same time period, a seroprevalence study of HIV-2 and HIV-1 was carried out, including 2,122 patients or healthy persons in Bissau. Antibodies to HIV-2 were demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and verified by Western blot analysis in 8.6% (46/535) of prenatal women, in 7.9% (9/114) of women attending a family-planning clinic, in 4.4% (19/427) of applicants for scholarships, in 17.6% (16/91) of blood donors tested during the first 2 months and 5.3% (10/189) of blood donors tested during the following months, in 5.7% (2/35) of police officers, in 36.7% (11/30) of female prostitutes, in 15.8% (97/614) of outpatients suspected of having tuberculosis, and in 55.2% (48/87) of patients clinically suspected of AIDS or AIDS-related disease. One of 2,001 subjects tested had antibodies specific for HIV-1. Another subject had an antibody pattern compatible with both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
