The authors studied the changes in plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolysis in 40 patients with nonoperable Stage III and IV lung cancer after cytostatic chemotherapy. The results show significant postchemotherapy increases in fibrinopeptide A levels, as well as a decrease in fibrinolytic activity reflected by a drop in functional tissue activator. Also the authors studied the potential accumulative effect of three chemotherapy cycles. A significant increase in functional plasminogen activator inhibitor has been noted. Chemotherapy is apparently capable of conditioning a decrease in fibrinolytic activity in these cancer patients that could be related to the enhanced tendency to developing thromboembolic phenomena after cytostatic chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "As with other cardiovascular diseases, there are sufficient data to suggest significant gender-related differences in the prevalence and presentation of congestive heart failure and myocardial diseases. From animal studies, it is apparent that there are sex-related differences in intrinsic ventricular function and in the cardiovascular response to various stimuli, which are at least partly modulated through direct effects of sex hormones on the heart. Although similar data are not available in humans, it seems likely that similar gender-related differences in cardiac function exist and may in part account for the observed differences in myocardial diseases in men and women. Additionally, genetic factors may contribute to these differences, as X-linked disorders may present differently in males and females. An awareness of the impact of sex-related factors is clearly important in the evaluation of any patient presenting with heart failure or cardiomyopathy and may alter both diagnostic and therapeutic considerations, as well as broaden our basic knowledge and understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in myocardial dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the coronary thrombolytic efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and early intravenous heparin, 134 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to combination therapy or t-PA only. At a median of 2.78 hours from symptom onset, 64 patients received both t-PA (1.5 mg/kg/4 hr) and a bolus of 10,000 units heparin, whereas 70 patients received t-PA alone at the same dose. All patients underwent coronary angiography 90 minutes after initiation of therapy to determine infarct vessel patency status, after which time the control group patients were eligible to receive heparin. Baseline demographic and angiographic characteristics were similar for the groups. Infarct vessel patency was 50 of 63 (79%) for combination t-PA and heparin and 54 of 68 (79%) for t-PA alone. Bleeding complications, as reflected by need for transfusion, were similar in the two groups: 13% in the patients treated with t-PA and heparin compared with 18% in patients treated with t-PA only (p = 0.53). The only intracranial hemorrhage in the trial occurred in a patient initially treated without heparin. Fibrinogen at 50 minutes after therapy was 32% decreased from baseline for the t-PA and heparin-treated patients compared with a 39% decrease in the control group. Predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction was similar for the two groups: 49.0 +/- 10.1% versus 50.2 +/- 11.9% for combined versus t-PA only therapy, respectively. We conclude that early intravenous heparin does not facilitate the fibrinolytic effect of t-PA at the doses tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the contribution of venous effects to the hemodynamic changes caused by atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), the cardiac and peripheral effects of ANF were compared with those induced by the venoarterial vasodilator sodium nitroprusside. On 3 different days, eight healthy subjects received 2-hour infusions of either ANF, sodium nitroprusside, or placebo, by a single-blind crossover design. ANF was administered at a rate of 15 ng/kg/min for hour 1 and 50 ng/kg/min for hour 2; each infusion rate was preceded by a 50-micrograms bolus. The lower ANF infusion rate increased plasma cGMP fourfold, but only modest cardiovascular effects (small decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes) were noted. At the higher ANF infusion rate, left ventricular volumes and intravascular volume, as indirectly assessed by changes in hematocrit levels, decreased further, which resulted in decreases in stroke volume, cardiac index, and systolic blood pressure. No evidence for arterial vasodilation (no decrease in diastolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, or forearm resistance) was obtained, and no increase in sympathetic activity was noted. In contrast, sodium nitroprusside caused arterial vasodilation, an increase in cardiac index, and significant increases in sympathetic activity. We conclude that short-term increases in plasma ANF within the physiologic range primarily affect the venous vascular bed (by decreasing intravascular volume or by venodilation) without increasing sympathetic activity.\r"

A 90% stenosis was generated by external constriction, reducing blood flow to 40 +/- 10% of baseline. Localized thrombosis was produced by endothelial cell injury and instillation of thrombin and fresh blood. Intravenous infusion for 60 minutes of either 30 micrograms/kg/min rt-PA alone or 10 micrograms/kg/min scu-PA alone consistently produced coronary artery recanalization (six of eight dogs and five of five dogs, respectively) but was almost always associated with reocclusion during or shortly after the end of the infusion (four of six dogs and five of five dogs, respectively).

Combined infusion of 3.75 micrograms/kg/min rt-PA and 1.25 micrograms/kg/min scu-PA for 60 minutes did not consistently cause recanalization (one of four dogs).

Serum for fibronectin (Fn) and somatomedin-C (Sm-C) was collected and nitrogen balance (NB) was measured on days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the study period. Estimated energy and protein requirements were based, respectively, on the patient's calculated basal energy expenditure multiplied by a stress factor and urea nitrogen excretion (plus 4) during 24-h urine collections. Enteral feedings were started 5.3 +/- 3.8 days after injury; patients received an average of 33.2 +/- 3.9 kcal/kg.day and 1.5 +/- 0.4 g protein/kg.day. Fn concentrations increased significantly (p less than .05) from baseline on study days 7, 14, 21, and 28, whereas NB increased significantly (p less than .05) on study days 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Significant correlations were found between Fn and NB (r = .52, p less than .005), Fn and cumulative caloric intake (r = .54, p less than .005), and Fn and cumulative nitrogen intake (r = .62, p less than .005). There were no significant changes observed with Sm-C concentrations during the study period. Measurement of Fn concentrations appears to have potential as a nutrition support marker in traumatized patients, particularly in monitoring short courses of nutrition support. The role of Sm-C as a nutrition marker requires further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation (Sv-O2) has recently been introduced as a monitoring and management technique in critical care patients. To determine the impact of Sv-O2 monitoring on patient management and cost-effectiveness, we conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial of 99 consecutive patients receiving pulmonary artery (PA) catheters in the ICU. One group (n = 49) received an Edwards quadruple-lumen flow-directed PA catheter. Another group (n = 50) received the Oximetrix Opticath, a flow-directed PA catheter utilizing reflective fiberoptic oximetry for continuous Sv-O2 monitoring. Data recorded included APACHE and TISS scores, duration of stay, number of catheter days, incidence of catheter problems and changes, number of blood gases (arterial and venous), and ICU mortality. Additionally, the early warning capability of Sv-O2 monitoring was analyzed by comparing the severity and outcome of potentially adverse hemodynamic events in both groups. Statistical analysis by step-deletion multiple regression analysis and the unpaired Student's t-test demonstrated that use of the Opticath was not associated with a decrease in potentially adverse hemodynamic events, length of ICU stay, or mortality. In terms of cost-effectiveness, mixed venous oximetry is economically favorable in a charge-based reimbursement system, but economically unfavorable in a fixed-cost-based reimbursement system. Although continuous Sv-O2 monitoring has been shown to be accurate and reliable, it does not appear to be beneficial in all patients requiring PA catheterization.\r"

Patients were in stable clinical condition three days after weaning from the acute-phase ventilation. Healthy nonsmokers served as controls. Breathing patterns were recorded for 20-min periods during unloaded breathing (R0), then with small inspiratory resistive loads (R1 = 2.5 cmH2O L/s and R2 = 5.2 cmH2O L/s) applied in random order. Respiratory parameters were memorized in real time and blood gases measured continuously with a transcutaneous PO2/PCO2 monitor and compared periodically with arterial blood gases. Minute volume (VE) and respiratory rate decreased with no modification in blood gas values. In the COPD patients, R1 was too small to be perceived; when R2 was applied, no increase in TI was observed, and VT and VT/TI decreased. The VE could not be maintained despite a shortening of expiratory time. The COPD patients did not have significant increase of occlusion pressure (P0.1). Mean blood gas values did not change during the testing, but the coefficient of variation of tcPCO2 increased. During the critical period following weaning from artificial ventilation, COPD patients did not respond in the same manner as normal subjects to inspiratory resistive loads, but did not have modified gas exchange during the 20-min period.\r"

Effects of prostaglandins (PG) and oxygen radicals were studied separately on the NK cell activity in the presence of AM. Indomethacin, catalase, or thiourea did not reverse inhibition of NK cell activity, but superoxide dismutase (SOD) prevented this phenomenon. These results suggest that the inhibition of NK cell activity by AM may be caused by O2 release rather than PG, H2O2, and OH.\r"

The \"bellows\" effect of external chest compressions (ECC) might prevent this problem if the airway were kept open by TTO. In dogs, we investigated the utility of TTO delivered at 15 L/min by a percutaneously placed intratracheal catheter, plus ECC (TTO/ECC) as an alternative method of ventilation during CPR. TTO was applied to anesthetized, paralyzed dogs in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) at various rates of ECC and during ventricular fibrillation (VF) at an ECC rate of 80/min. During NSR and VF, hypercapnia did not develop and arterial oxygen saturations were maintained above 90 percent. During NSR, the PaCO2 decreased and the pH increased as the ECC rate increased. For many of the animals, coronary perfusion pressure remained above 20 mm Hg during VF, suggesting that these animals could be resuscitated to NSR. In another phase, after 15 min of VF using TTO/ECC, seven of nine animals were defibrillated. We conclude that ventilatory and hemodynamic support adequate to permit successful resuscitation to NSR is provided by the combination of TTO/ECC to apneic dogs during VF.\r"

Stimulation of electrogenic sodium absorption by alanine (10 mM) increased basal short-circuit currents more in piebald tissues than in tissues from normal mice, whereas stimulation of ion transport by carbachol (10 microM) evoked an increase in short-circuit current that was similar in the two groups. Alterations in intestinal mass, morphology, or Na+, K+-ATPase activity could not account for the increase in absorptive function characteristic of piebald mice.\r"

Extension of the culture period did not result in reduced immunogenicity of the nonislet material. Immunostaining of islet or nonislet tissue from the culture system failed to demonstrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II positive cells in the islet tissue, whereas the presence of MHC class II staining cells in the nonislet components was clearly demonstrable. These results demonstrate that the islet tissue obtained by culture isolation is free of cells capable of stimulating an allogeneic immune response and are consistent with the hypothesis that the absence of MHC class II positive antigen-presenting cells reduces the immunogenicity of the tissue and enhances the survival of allogeneic grafts.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro effects of the sulfonylurea glyburide on insulin binding and action were compared in adipocytes from control and nonketotic streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Adipose tissue from control and diabetic animals was maintained in the absence or presence of 2 micrograms/ml glyburide for 20 h. Insulin binding and insulin-stimulated glucose transport were examined in adipocytes prepared from this tissue. As expected, insulin binding was increased in adipocytes from diabetic animals. Exposure of tissue to glyburide did not influence insulin binding in either control or diabetic cells. Glucose transport activity of diabetic cells, assessed with 2-deoxyglucose, was decreased 30-40% in both the absence (basal) and presence of insulin compared with controls. Glyburide potentiated insulin's effects in both control (15-20%) and diabetic (30-40%) adipocytes. As a result, glucose transport activity in glyburide-treated diabetic cells was restored to a level similar to that of control cells not exposed to the drug. The mechanism by which glyburide potentiated glucose transport activity was examined with the D-glucose-displaceable cytochalasin B-binding technique to measure glucose-transporter concentration in membranes prepared from control and diabetic adipocytes exposed to the drug. Adipocytes from this model of diabetes are known to have a decreased cellular content of glucose transporters. The concentration of glucose transporters was decreased by 31% in plasma membranes from insulin-treated diabetic cells. There were corresponding decreases in diabetic microsomal and total membrane fractions. There was also a 40% decrease in the translocation of transporters from the microsomes to the plasma membrane in response to insulin in diabetic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A method is described in which the viability of isolated adult human islets of Langerhans can be assessed in vivo. The Rowett nude rat, made diabetic with streptozocin (STZ), has been used as the islet recipient in these studies. Although these animals are athymic and are able to accept xenogeneic grafts for prolonged periods, they are very susceptible to dehydration and infection once made diabetic. Therefore, a considerably shortened diabetes induction period was used. The basis of the study was to prepare pure adult human pancreatic islets that were cultured for 48 h. Nude rats were given 80 mg/kg i.v. STZ during islet isolation and were transplanted with 800-1000 islets under the renal capsule at 48 h. To monitor islet function, animals were bled regularly for random blood glucose measurements and were given a glucose tolerance test at day 20. The kidney containing the graft was removed on day 21 to allow histological assessment of the graft and to confirm that glucose control was due to the transplanted islets and was not secondary to reversion of the animal's own islets. Seven rats were transplanted, and five were deemed to have received viable human islets. Two rats that received islets from the same donor did not reverse their diabetes and were found by histology to have vacuolated islet structures with scant insulin-staining tissue under the kidney capsule. This method allows a definitive judgment of the ability of isolated adult human islets to reverse diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported previously that the plasma concentration of ascorbic acid (AA) is reduced in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats and can be normalized by treatment with the aldose reductase inhibitor tolrestat. This study was designed to investigate further the relationship between the polyol pathway and AA metabolism in diabetic rats. Disturbance of AA metabolism was demonstrable after 1 wk of diabetes. Dietary myo-inositol supplementation was effective in normalizing plasma AA levels, as was treatment with tolrestat. In untreated diabetes, despite low plasma AA concentration, there was increased urinary excretion of AA that was reversed by treatment with either tolrestat or myo-inositol. In contrast, AA supplementation normalized plasma AA concentrations while further increasing urinary AA excretion. The abnormality of AA metabolism was less severe in galactose-fed rats, which had normal plasma AA levels and only minor increases in urinary AA excretion. These studies demonstrated a disturbance in the regulation of plasma and urinary AA concentration in experimental diabetes and confirmed the relationship of AA with the polyol pathway. Because AA has many important biological functions, abnormalities of AA metabolism could be important in the pathogenesis of some diabetic complications. The interaction of the polyol and AA pathways suggests that this could be another site of action for aldose reductase inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "In humans, data on biotransformation enzymes in the intestine, and to a lesser extent in the liver, are rather scarce. Much knowledge about these enzymes is, therefore, obtained from animal studies. We were able to examine both small intestinal and hepatic tissue from a kidney donor and performed a systematic study on enzyme contents and distribution in these organs. In the small intestine the longitudinal distribution of cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, and bilirubin uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase declined from duodenum to ileum. Activity of 4-nitrophenol- and 4-methylumbelliferone UDP-glucuronosyltransferase increased or remained constant, respectively. Total and specific activity of most enzymes was much higher in the liver, except for bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and glutathione S-transferase, where the small intestine contained 28.6% and 7.4% of total hepatic activity, respectively. The relatively great amount of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity in the small intestinal mucosa of this patient, who probably suffered from Gilbert's syndrome, could indicate that under pathological conditions intestinal metabolism may contribute significantly to the clearance of bilirubin. With a monoclonal antibody, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms were immunodetectable in microsomes. In the liver, two bands, one of 57 kilodaltons and one in between 53 and 54 kilodaltons, were seen. In the proximal small intestine two isoforms (53 and 54 kilodaltons) were detected. However, in the distal small intestine where bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity was low, only one isoform (54 kilodaltons) was seen. This may indicate that bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity is correlated with the 53-kilodalton isoform. The presence of multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms in humans, similar to that described before in the rat, is further established by this study.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies have indicated that lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin B become redistributed within pancreatic acinar cells during the early stages of both diet- and secretagogue-induced acute pancreatitis. As a result, cathepsin B and digestive zymogens became colocalized within large cytoplasmic vacuoles. As cathepsin B can activate trypsinogen, this colocalization could result in intracellular digestive enzyme activation. The present study investigates the protective effects of gabexate mesilate (FOY) and camostate (FOY 305) on both of these noninvasive models of experimental pancreatitis. These esterase inhibitors prevented the hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema, and acinar cell vacuolization that characterize secretagogue-induced pancreatitis and the hyperamylasemia and mortality that characterize diet-induced pancreatitis. In addition, FOY and FOY 305 were found to significantly decrease the subcellular redistribution of cathepsin B that occurs in both models. These findings indicate that enzyme activity sensitive to inhibition by FOY and FOY 305 may be critical to the redistribution phenomenon that characterizes both of these models of pancreatitis.\r"

A luminal perfusate containing 56 mM glucose was compared with a control perfusate containing mannitol in two jejunal segments constructed in the same animal. Mucosal protein synthesis rates were determined when the tracer amino acid was administered intravenously and intraluminally. The results indicated that luminal glucose perfusion rapidly stimulated mucosal protein synthesis in the fed state by 20% and 37% with the labeled amino acid derived from the vascular and luminal compartment, respectively. A 16-h fast abolished the stimulatory effect of glucose when the labeled amino acid was given intravascularly but not intraluminally. These effects of glucose could be ascribed to a direct alteration of mucosal metabolism rather than to indirect systemic effects.\r"

In a control study ANF was administered without Ca2+ entry blockade or converting enzyme inhibition. Natriuresis rose from 239 +/- 38 to 605 +/- 137 mumol/min in the control study (p less than 0.05), from 330 +/- 53 to 943 +/- 152 mumol/min with Ca2+ entry blockade (p less than 0.05), and from 236 +/- 22 to 344 +/- 39 mumol/min with converting enzyme inhibition (NS). ANF induced a rise in maximal free water clearance, inulin clearance, and in the excretion of multiple electrolytes except potassium. Fractional lithium reabsorption fell. In general, these effects were stronger during Ca2+ entry blockade and blunted during converting enzyme inhibition. p-Aminohippurate clearance tended to decrease during the control study (NS), remained constant during Ca2+ entry blockade, and decreased significantly when ANF was infused during converting enzyme inhibition (p less than 0.05 vs. control and vs. Ca2+ entry blockade study). Blood pressure was lowered by Ca2+ entry blockade and, to a somewhat greater extent, by converting enzyme inhibition, but ANF administration induced no additional fall except for a short-term drop during Ca2+ entry blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Considerations for formula selection include the form and source of nutrients, cost, and goals of therapy. Administration may be by a bolus, intermittent gravity drip, continuous infusion, or cyclic infusion method. Selection of an appropriate access route should consider the length of therapy, medical condition, pathology of the gastrointestinal tract, and the infusion method. Discharge teaching should stress maintenance of the patency and tube position, accurate formula delivery, and proper use of equipment and supplies. Issues involving reimbursement and financial responsibility should be addressed before the home therapy is initiated. Home patients should be monitored and reassessed regularly to update the plan of care and goals of therapy. Vendors should be selected on the basis of their capability to meet the patient's needs. If all phases are implemented, home enteral nutrition is a safe and acceptable means of nutrient delivery.\r"

  ".W": "The response of T cells to minor lymphocyte-stimulating locus (Mls) determinants remains poorly understood with respect to the antigenic determinants responsible for T cell stimulation and the types of APC capable of stimulating the response. In this report, we demonstrate that highly purified dendritic cells (DC) as well as B cells have the capacity to stimulate Mls-specific responses. Unseparated spleen cells, purified DC, resting B cells, and activated B cells were compared for their capacity to stimulate several Mls-reactive T cell hybridomas. Whereas the entire panel of Mls-reactive T cell hybridomas was stimulated strongly by unseparated spleen cells and activated B cells, the hybridomas responded only weakly to purified DC or resting B cells. Activation of resting B cells with either B cell stimulatory factor-1 (1 day pre-treatment) or LPS/dextran (2 or 3 day pre-treatment) greatly augmented their Mls-stimulatory capacity. In contrast, the Mls-stimulatory capacity of DC was not augmented by a 1-day pre-treatment with either B cell stimulatory factor-1 or supernatant from the DC-induced primary anti-Mls-MLR. In the primary anti-Mls-MLR, both purified DC and LPS/dextran-stimulated B blasts were found to elicit vigorous T cell proliferative responses. Much weaker responses were elicited by unseparated spleen cells. The stimulation of the primary anti-Mls-MLR by purified DC was further confirmed by producing Mls-specific T cell clones which were preferentially stimulated by DC. Autologous (Mlsb) DC were found to markedly enhance the primary anti-Mls-MLR response to small numbers of Mlsa B blasts. Thus, DC possess other \"accessory cell\" properties that augment the primary anti-Mls-MLR despite the predicted low level of Mls determinant expression on DC based on the results obtained with Mls-reactive hybridomas. Possible accessory cell properties of DC relevant to this phenomenon are discussed.\r"

This presumably occurs via direct binding of peptides to class II molecules at the cell surface. More recently, it has been shown that viable target cells can present peptides and endogenous, but not exogenous, protein Ag in association with class I MHC molecules to CTL. We have derived CTL specific for a chicken OVA peptide (OVA258-276) recognized in association with H-2Kb. These CTL recognize target cells that endogenously synthesize OVA and cells \"loaded\" with native OVA but fail to recognize target cells in the presence of exogenous native OVA. Thus, OVA must be intracellularly located to be processed and presented for CTL recognition. It remains unclear, however, whether exogenous peptides require internalization and further processing by target cells or are able to associate directly with class I molecules at the cell surface for CTL recognition. We provide evidence that glutaraldehyde-fixed cells can present synthetic peptides to H-2Kb- and H-2Db-restricted CTL and that such presentation does not require internalization or processing. The peptides used range in size from 16 to 48 amino acids in length. In contrast, glutaraldehyde-fixed cells are incapable of presenting Ag to CTL specific for influenza nucleoprotein and OVA if the cells are fixed within 1 h of viral influenza infection or loading with OVA. Thus, CTL recognition of antigenic peptides appears to occur via direct binding of peptides to class I molecules at the cell surface and does not require any intracellular processing events.\r"

  ".W": "The study of T lymphocytes from pleural fluid and tissue of patients with tuberculous pleuritis provides an opportunity to evaluate the human immune response to infection at the site of disease activity. Therefore, we investigated the phenotype and function of CD4+ pleural fluid cells from patients with tuberculous pleuritis. Pleural fluid was enriched with CD4+CDw29+ T lymphocytes, which are thought to represent \"memory\" T cells. Immunoperoxidase staining of pleural tissue confirmed the predominance of CD4+CDw29+ T lymphocytes at the site of disease activity. CD4+ subpopulations were evaluated for their ability to contribute to a cell-mediated immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by assaying immune function in vitro. Pleural fluid-derived CD4+CDw29+ cells, but not CD4+CDw29- lymphocytes, proliferated vigorously and produced high levels of IFN-gamma when stimulated with purified protein derivative of M. tuberculosis. CD4+CDw29+ clones produced IFN-gamma specifically in response to purified protein derivative of M. tuberculosis but not to an irrelevant Ag, tetanus toxoid. IFN-gamma levels were markedly elevated in pleural fluid, compared to peripheral blood, suggesting production of this lymphokine in vivo at the site of tissue inflammation. The sum of these data indicate that, in tuberculous pleuritis, CD4+CDw29+ cells are concentrated at the site of disease activity, produce IFN-gamma and are likely to play an important role in the local human cell-mediated immune response to M. tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple low dose streptozotocin (STZ) is believed to induce immunologically mediated islet cell necrosis. We sought to establish whether this agent also increased MHC expression, as has been reported for other diabetes models. STZ (40 mg/kg/day for 5 days) produced increased levels of both class I and II MHC products in kidney, liver, heart, and pancreas. Class I expression was induced in renal tubular cells, Kupffer cells, hepatocytes, occasional cardiac myocytes, and cells within the pancreatic islet. In contrast, class II products were increased in dendritic cells, renal tubules, and cells within the pancreatic islet. Steady state mRNA levels for class I, class II, and beta 2-microglobulin correlate closely with the level of MHC products measured by radiolabeled antibody binding, suggesting that changes in MHC expression reflect changes in gene transcription. The effect is T cell dependent and inhibitable by cyclosporine. IFN-gamma is an essential mediator of the MHC induction; administration of a neutralizing antibody blocks the increase in expression. Furthermore, this antibody attenuates the hyperglycemic response to STZ, demonstrating a pathogenic role for IFN-gamma in mediating beta cell damage. We conclude that the MHC induction observed after low dose STZ is due to immunologic mechanisms, in particular the release of lymphokines such as IFN-gamma from T cells. The release of IFN-gamma and changes in MHC expression may be relevant to the injury seen with this agent.\r"

  ".W": "Human monocytes can be triggered to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by murine antibodies. In this study, a series of H chain isotype switch variant antibodies against glycophorin A on human RBC was used to study the influence of isotype on the induction of ADCC. Furthermore, it was studied whether the functional heterogeneity in responsiveness to IgG1 and IgG2b anti-CD3 antibodies, as found among different donors in T cell proliferation induction experiments, was reflected in ADCC. Whereas IgG2a induced ADCC to the same extent in monocytes from all donors, IgG1 showed a heterogeneous pattern, which corresponded to the heterogeneity in T cell proliferation studies. IgG1 anti-CD3 nonresponder monocytes could, however, be induced to ADCC by IgG1 antiglycophorin, although they needed a much higher antibody density on the target cell than did responder monocytes. IgG2b antiglycophorin at a high density induced ADCC in monocytes from all donors irrespective of responsiveness to IgG2b anti-CD3, whereas IgE and IgA antiglycophorin were barely effective in monocytes from all donors. By specific blocking with mAb, the FcR that were involved in ADCC directed by the various isotypes were characterized. ADCC by IgG2a was predominantly mediated by FcRI and could be specifically enhanced by culturing the monocytes with rIFN-gamma. ADCC by IgG1 was predominantly mediated through FcRII in both anti-CD3 responder and nonresponder monocytes. FcRII was also involved in ADCC by IgG2b, although other receptors seemed to contribute significantly to ADCC. When FcRII or FcRI were blocked, IgG1 and IgG2a could also functionally interact with FcRI and FcRII, respectively, provided that the target cells were sensitized to a high degree. These findings indicate that FcRI and both forms of FcRII can mediate cytotoxicity and that the specificity of human FcR for murine isotypes is relative.\r"

One antidextran with a reduced binding constant for dextran had the same combining site size as the parental mAb.

Antibodies with J kappa 4-containing L chains expressed the 10.16.1 (anti-alpha(1----6) dextran) idiotype. In contrast variants expressing L chains with J kappa 5 lost idiotype expression, except when oligosaccharide is present on VH; all antibodies with J kappa 5 L chains continued to bind dextran but with reduced affinity. The presence of carbohydrate in VH may alter the conformation of both paratope and idiotope. Alteration of H chain isotype did not appear to significantly alter the ability of the antidextran to bind Ag; an exception may be that switching V regions to the IgM C region may decrease the apparent affinity for Ag.\r"

  ".U": "89124366\r", 
  ".W": "Several chymotryptic-type protease inhibitors were found to inhibit both anti-CD3 mAb- and PHA-induced rise in Ca2+ and IL-2 production in Jurkat T cells. The magnitude of inhibition was a function of the effectors used to stimulate Ca2+ entry and depended on the concentration of the inhibitors. Neither tryptic-type protease inhibitors nor an elastase substrate prevented anti-CD3 mAb- or PHA-induced Ca2+ rise in Jurkat cells. The inhibitory effect of N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl-ketone on anti-CD3 mAb- and PHA-induced rise in Ca2+ resulted from a rapid increase in Ca2+ efflux. The inhibitors which were effective on Ca2+ mobilization also inhibited IL-2 production initiated by an anti-CD3 mAb in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and to a lesser extent by PHA or the calcium ionophore A23187. No inhibition of IL-2 production was observed when tryptic-type protease inhibitors or the elastase inhibitor were used. In addition, membrane preparations from Jurkat cells were found to hydrolyze the chymotryptic substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-paranitroaniline, an effect markedly inhibited by N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethylketone. Moreover, this inhibitor protected one potential endogenous substrate (Mr 38 kDa) from proteolysis. Taken together, these observations show that chymotryptic-type protease inhibitors block the responses generated by the binding of anti-CD3 mAb to Jurkat cells, and suggest that a chymotryptic-like membrane protease contributes to T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examined the potential role of IL-1 and TNF in granuloma formation. Mice were given i.v. injections of Schistosoma mansoni eggs or Sephadex beads to induce synchronous immune T cell-mediated (hypersensitivity type) or nonimmune (foreign-body type) granulomas, respectively. Granuloma macrophages isolated at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days of granuloma formation were evaluated for their capacity to produce IL-1 and TNF in response to 1 microgram/ml LPS. This was related to circulating levels of the acute phase protein, serum amyloid P (SAP) and expression of Ia Ag by monocytes and macrophages. Macrophages from nonimmune bead lesions were generally weak producers of IL-1 and TNF. In contrast, those from T cell-mediated egg lesions produced significant levels of both monokines. Moreover, there was a clear pattern of sequential monokine production such that IL-1 was produced in greatest amounts early (2 to 4 days), whereas TNF was produced later (8 to 16 days). Levels of SAP showed an initial sharp rise following particle embolization, then decreased rapidly in bead injected animals. However, mice with immune granulomas showed a prolonged elevation in SAP levels that corresponded to the period of maximal IL-1 production (2 to 4 days). Macrophage/monocyte Ia Ag expression was greatest at 8 to 16 days, corresponding to the period of TNF production. Bead injected animals showed low levels of Ia expression over the study period. These findings suggest that IL-1 may be important in the early recruitment stages of granuloma formation while TNF may take part in later maintenance or effector functions. The extent of production of both is likely influenced by the local or systemic milieu of lymphokines.\r"

Negative selection in vitro by use of mAb and C allowed phenotypic identification of the producer cells; most, if not all, carried Thy-1, and approximately one half expressed CD4, the other half, CD8. Depletion of cells in vivo by treatment of mice with mAb led to somewhat different results; again, anti-Thy-1 antibody eliminated essentially all IFN-gamma PC, but considerably more than 50% were either CD4+ or CD8+, suggesting regulatory interactions between these T lymphocyte subsets with regard to generation of the lymphokine.\r"

  ".W": "The P28-1 Ag induces a strong protective immunity toward Schistosoma mansoni infection in various experimental models. T lymphocytes of mice immunized with the recombinant P28-1 Ag were stimulated in vitro by schistosome Ag of different development stages and by three P28-1 Ag-derived synthetic peptides. The most significant stimulation was achieved with the 24-43 peptide. The use of two fragments of this peptide showed that the P28-1 T lymphocyte specificity concerned essentially the NH2 terminal sequence of the 24-43 peptide. Moreover, T lymphocytes specific for the 24-43 peptide were stimulated by both schistosome Ag and the recombinant P28-1 protein. The passive transfer of (Th + Ts) lymphocytes recovered from P28-1 Ag-immunized mice increased the IgG response to P28-1 and its peptides during infection but did not protect against a challenge infection, such as the passive transfer of anti-P28-1 sera. In contrast, P28-1 specific Th cell lines maintained in culture for 2 mo, passively transferred a strong protection (50%) to infected mice. Supernatants of P28-1-specific T cells obtained after stimulation with the corresponding Ag, were able to confer cytotoxic properties to platelets and macrophages. The presence of IFN-gamma for the cytotoxicity mediated by platelets and macrophage activating factor for the cytotoxicity mediated by macrophages in these supernatants is in a large part responsible for the parasite killing observed. Finally, a preliminary immunogenetic approach with H-2 congenic mice on BALB background showed that the P28-1 Ag T cell response was under the control of the MHC and that the H-2b haplotype determined a low response to P28-1 Ag and its peptides while H-2d and k haplotypes determined high responders.\r"

The map of this cluster of cosmid clones indicated that the rabbit VH and JH regions were separated by 63 kb.

The nucleotide sequences of the JH region and one of the DH segments have been determined. The DH segment has conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by 12 and 11 bp at the 3' and 5' sides, respectively, of the coding region and hence, appears to be a functional gene. The nucleotide sequence of the JH region revealed four functional JH gene segments and one JH pseudogene. Inasmuch as the JH region had previously been linked by contiguous overlapping clones with C mu, C gamma, C epsilon, and one C alpha gene, this VH-DH-JH cluster and the clones containing the Ig H chain C region genes represent 190 kb of contiguous germ-line DNA of the Ig H chain locus.\r"

Antigenic analysis with different antisera to catfish Ig resulted in the definition of cDNA clones encoding the catfish H chain. Sequence analysis confirmed that the catfish H chain was definitively identified, based on its similarities with chicken and mouse mu chains. Two clones were each shown to encode part of the CH2 domain, the complete CH3 and CH4 domains, the C-terminus, and a 184-bp 3' untranslated region before the poly(A+) tail. The conservation of domain size and structure is clearly evident. The two cysteines forming the intradomain disulfide bridge, as well as the tryptophans located within each domain, are absolutely conserved. There are four carbohydrate acceptor sites in the catfish H chain, only one of which is phylogenetically conserved. Of the six sequenced H chain clones, one was found to differ in a single base in the CH3, which results in the loss of a carbohydrate acceptor site. Whether this difference indicates isotypic variation between closely related genes or somatic mutation is unresolved. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicate that there is a approximately 24% similarity when the catfish H chain is aligned with mouse mu chains. This is considerably less than the approximately 40% amino acid conservation found between the chicken and mouse mu chain. The amino acid sequence of the catfish H chain is most conserved in the C-terminus (approximately 30%) and the CH4 (approximately 26%); there is less conservation in the CH3 (approximately 20%) when comparisons are made with mouse mu chain. The CH3 domain of the catfish H chain also has different hydropathy properties, when compared with the CH3 domain of the higher vertebrate mu chains. Finally, the sequence of the catfish H chain indicates an unusual arrangement of the cysteines that likely participate in intersubunit and inter-H chain disulfide linkages. The disulfide linkage of these cysteines during Ig polymerization may account for the unusual covalent architecture associated with the catfish tetramer.\r"

These two Bf transcripts in kidney or intestine are identical in structure except for a 300 bp 5' extension found in the 2.7-kb mRNA. The long Bf transcript originates from a tissue-specific alternative site of transcriptional initiation upstream of the initiation site for the 2.4-kb mRNA, as determined by primer extension and nuclease protection assays. The upstream initiation site lacks a typical promoter motif and is only 80 bp downstream from the terminus of the murine C2 gene. After stimulation in vivo with endotoxin, only the 2.4-kb mRNA increases in kidney indicating independent regulation of the two Bf transcripts. The differences in 5' untranslated region generated in these two Bf mRNA species may affect local concentrations of factor B protein in kidney and intestine by mechanisms depending on differential translation rates or stability of mRNA.\r"

Spleen cells from IL-2-treated neonatal mice and from neonatal mice that were treated in vitro with IL-2 transferred protection to neonatal mice. These cells, by adherence, silica, and asialo GM 1 antibody treatment, were shown to be macrophages. IL-2 treatment in vitro enhanced the neonatal macrophages' ADCC function and superoxide release. Similar protection was induced by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-treated spleen cells. Antibody to IFN-gamma ablated both IFN-gamma- and IL-2-induced protection by adherent spleen cells.

  ".W": "We analyzed the effects of 3'-azido-3'deoxythymidine (AZT) and alpha and gamma interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma) on transformation of human umbilical cord lymphocytes (HUCLs) by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). B lymphocytic outgrowth from HUCLs infected with EBV was monitored by focus formation; the presence of EBV genomes in transformed foci was confirmed by in situ cytohybridization and EBV nuclear antigen. The 50% inhibitory doses for preventing focus formation were 0.14 microM for AZT, 10 units (U)/mL for IFN-alpha, and 1 U/mL for IFN-gamma. To determine whether inhibition resulted from direct cytotoxic effects, we assessed the viability of nontransformed HUCLs exposed to the agents for 30 d. The nontoxic doses were 1 microM for AZT, 30 U/mL for IFN-alpha, and 3 U/mL for IFN-gamma. Combining IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma with AZT or IFN-alpha with IFN-gamma at nontoxic doses showed synergistic decreases in numbers of transformed foci. Transformation of HUCLs by EBV was sensitive to, but not abolished by, these agents at doses below those required for cell killing.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that in vitro exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to morphine results in suppressed respiratory-burst activity of monocytes and impaired interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by lymphocytes. To investigate the potential in vivo effect of an opiate on these cell functions, PBMC were obtained from patients maintained on methadone. These freshly isolated mononuclear cells had a significantly impaired capacity to generate superoxide anion (O2-) in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), while production of IFN-gamma by concanavalin A-stimulated cells was intact. After cell culture for 48 h, the defective O2- generating capacity was sustained. Also, culturing PBMC from healthy controls in the presence of methadone or morphine at concentrations as low as 10(-12) M caused significant suppression of PMA-stimulated O2- release. Because reactive oxygen intermediates produced by PBMC may participate in host defense against opportunistic pathogens in AIDS, these results underscore the need for investigations of the biological consequences of opiate-mediated immunosuppression.\r"

HLA-DR2 and DQw1 were associated with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (attributable risk = 36% and 39%, respectively), while DQw3 was associated even more strongly with the control group (preventive fraction = 57%). Antibody titers to the TB71 and TB72 epitopes of the 38-kDa protein, present only on tubercle bacilli, were strongly associated with DR2 (Pcorr = .001 and .024, respectively). The association of both the disease and the antibody response to the 38-kDa antigen of M. tuberculosis with Class II HLA genes HLA-DR2 indicates that Ir-gene-mediated regulation of the immune response to this antigen may be of pathogenic significance for the development of sputum smear-positive tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate nitrogen absorption in the absence of the pancreas, six patients with total pancreatectomy, all in stable nutritional and metabolic condition, underwent two periods of enteral nutrition identical in all respects except for the nitrogen source. Nitrogen source was either lactalbumin or its hydrolysate. The quantity and quality of calories infused simulated the patient's usual diet, which was a high-protein diet (2.0 +/- 0.4 gm/kg body weight). Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was discontinued during each period of enteral nutrition. All patients had greater nitrogen absorption during the enteral nutrition with lactalbumin hydrolysate than that with lactalbumin (91% +/- 2% vs 61% +/- 6% of nitrogen intake, p less than 0.02). Despite this difference in absorption, nitrogen balances during the two periods of enteral nutrition were not significantly different. This appeared to be caused by a urea production rate that was greater during the enteral nutrition with lactalbumin hydrolysate than the rate during that with lactalbumin (26 +/- 1 gm/24 hr vs 16 +/- 3 gm/24 hr, p less than 0.05). Plasma concentrations of amino acids and proteins did not differ significantly during the two treatments. In conclusion, the data suggest that (1) the intestine plays a significant role in protein digestion and that (2) enteral feeding with a protein hydrolysate could eliminate the need for a high-protein diet in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.\r"

Thiotepa was administered intravenously (IV) over two hours daily for three consecutive days followed in three to four days by marrow transplantation. The daily dose ranged from 60 to 525 mg/m2 (total dose, 180 to 1,575 mg/m2). A total of 71 patients with malignant melanoma were treated. Forty-three patients (61%) had received prior cytotoxic therapy and 28 were untreated. Sixty-two patients (87%) had melanoma disseminated to at least one visceral site, nine patients had skin and/or lymphatic metastases only. As of January 1, 1988 one patient was too early to be evaluated, 15 patients were inevaluable for tumor response, four patients had a complete response (CR), and 25 patients had a partial response (PR) to treatment. The response rates (95% confidence interval) for the 55 evaluable patients and for all 71 treated patients were 53% (40% to 65%) and 41% (30% to 53%), respectively. The median duration of response was 3 months, with a range of 1 to 31 + months. Three patients were alive and well without evidence of tumor more than 1 year after treatment. Analysis of patient subsets indicated that neither total dose, previous cytotoxic therapy, or sites of metastases influenced response rate. In this study, high-dose thiotepa has demonstrated a high response rate in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma with both PRs and CRs noted. Although most of the responses were not durable, 10% of the responses lasted more than 1 year. Future studies will evaluate additional methods for increasing the response rate and improving the duration of response.\r"

In eight cases, microvascular Doppler sonography was used to measure flow velocities and vasomotor reactivity to CO2 changes. Intravascular pressure recordings of the draining veins on the medullary surface were performed in nine cases. The flow velocities in dural AV fistula feeding vessels were not as high as has been shown in cerebral angioma feeders. The AV fistula feeders often showed low end-diastolic flow velocities as a sign of increased vascular resistance, even in the presence of a downstream AV fistula, thus proving disturbance of venous outflow from the spinal canal. After excision of the fistula, the circulation of the spinal cord vessels improved, with higher inflow and outflow velocities. In the veins formerly draining the fistula, no further flow could be recorded; however, they did not collapse, indicating that some pressure remained. The mean venous pressure in the dural AV fistulas was about 74% of the systemic arterial pressure. It increased concomitantly with the arterial pressure, which may explain the clinical deterioration that occurs during physical activity. Fistulas with a high shunt volume on angiography showed only moderately increased venous pressures and a more pronounced pressure drop compared to low-volume fistulas. The CO2 reactivity of vessels supplying the spinal cord could be demonstrated in all cases, and was normal before and after removal of the fistula.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large well-demarcated abnormality with hyper- and hypodense regions on T2-weighted images. The abnormality did not extend into the white matter. Histological sections of the biopsy specimen disclosed an organoid transcortical lesion composed of interlacing finger-like fascicles of vascularized fibromeninges. Most fascicles exhibited one or more central slit-like capillaries cuffed by fibroblasts and invaginated meningeal tissue arranged in a parallel or concentric manner. Typical psammoma bodies were evident throughout the lesion, as well as in the intervening, mildly gliotic cerebral cortex. Proliferative meningothelial cells were present in the overlying leptomeninges. The lesion in this case was a hamartoma rather than a neoplasm.\r"

Early signs of myelofibrosis with increase of reticulin were present in rachitic infants with anemia. In patients of the same age with iron deficiency anemia, the bone marrow reticulin findings were normal.

INTERVENTIONS: Either a human milk preparation (n = 7) or sterile water (n = 9) was administered by continuous nasogastric feeding (14 mL/kg/d) over a 2-week study period while the infants received parenteral nutrition. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Small intestine perfusion studies and biopsies were performed at the beginning and end of the study. Age, duration of prior illness, severity of malnutrition, glucose and water absorption, disaccharidase activities, atrophy of villi, and nutritional intake were comparable in both groups of infants. At the end of the 2-week study, improvement toward normal sucrase activity and intraepithelial lymphocytes was found in significantly fewer infants in the milk group than in the water group. No differences were noted in glucose and water absorption or in lactase and maltase activities as a function of the milk versus water treatment.

The records of these infants were reviewed to define the clinical characteristics of infants likely to develop hyperglycemia and to see whether insulin administration would allow goals for energy intake to be met. There were 76 surviving infants; 34 received insulin and 42 did not. Treated infants were smaller (767 +/- 161 vs 872 +/- 98 gm; p = 0.0004), were more immature (26.8 +/- 1.4 vs 27.7 +/- 2.0 weeks; p = 0.0115), and required mechanical ventilation longer (28 +/- 19 vs 17 +/- 15 days; p = 0.0196). There were no significant differences between the groups at 3, 7, 10, or 14 days for intravenously administered glucose or for total nonprotein energy intake at 3, 7, 10, 14, 28, or 56 days. Treated infants achieved an intake of 100 kcal/kg/day (419 kilojoules/kg/day) at 15 +/- 8 vs 17 +/- 11 days and regained birth weight at 12 +/- 6 vs 13 +/- 6 days (NS). There was no difference in percent change from birth weight at 7, 14, 28, or 56 days. Treated infants had a glucose concentration of 195 +/- 60 mg/dl (10.8 +/- 3.3 mmol/L) while receiving 7.9 +/- 3.0 mg/kg/min (43 +/- 17 mumol/kg/min) of glucose at the start of insulin infusion on days 1 to 14. Insulin was given for 1 to 58 days. The initial dose was 40 to 100 mU/gm of dextrose infused (57 to 142 nmol/mol) and then gradually decreased. Less than 0.5% of blood glucose values were 25 to 40 mg/dl (1.4 to 2.2 mmol/L). We conclude that insulin infusion improves glucose tolerance in extremely low birth weight infants and allows hyperglycemic infants to achieve adequate energy intake similar to that of infants who do not become hyperglycemic.\r"

Basal follicle-stimulating hormone values and both luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone peak responses to stimulation by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone were also suppressed, although basal luteinizing hormone values did not differ. Linear growth rate and the rate of bone age advancement decreased during leuprolide therapy. Side effects were minimal.

A substantial portion of these costs would offset current spending elsewhere in the health care system. Improvement of state packages and increased provider payment could result in sharp increases in costs.

X-ray films revealed a destruction lesion in the vertebral body of the 12th thoracic vertebra. On the plain thoracic computed tomography scan, the finding was a soap-bubble appearance with a linear high density area in the mass lesion which destroyed the vertebral body. Preoperative angiography showed no apparent feeding artery to the tumor tissue; preoperative myelography showed incomplete block at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra. A radical operation was carried out in one stage via a combined antero-posterior approach. In order to give radiotherapy immediately after operation, a vascular pedicled rib graft was made.

The fibrin sealant group from the prospective study was compared with historical matched control subjects for postoperative blood loss, need for resternotomy, blood products received, and hospital stay. It was also compared with historical nonmatched control subjects for the incidence of resternotomy and mortality. The results showed a 92.6% success rate for fibrin sealant in controlling bleeding within 5 minutes of application, compared with only a 12.4% success rate with conventional topical agents (p less than 0.001). Fibrin sealant also rapidly controlled 82.0% of those bleeding episodes not initially controlled by conventional agents. High-volume postoperative blood loss was significantly less (p less than 0.05) in the fibrin sealant group than in the matched controls. Additionally, resternotomy rates after redo operations were significantly lower in the fibrin sealant group (5.6%) than in the nonmatched historical control group (10%) (p less than 0.0089). There were no significant differences in hospital stay or blood products received between the fibrin sealant group and matched historical controls and no difference in mortality between the fibrin sealant group and nonmatched historical controls. There were no documented instances of adverse reactions, transmission of viral infection (hepatitis B, non-A/non-B hepatitis), or human immunodeficiency virus seroconversion. This study shows that fibrin sealant is safe and highly effective in controlling localized bleeding in cardiac operations. Fibrin sealant reduces postoperative blood loss and decreases the incidence of emergency resternotomy. These findings make fibrin sealant a valuable hemostatic agent in cardiac surgery.\r"

  ".W": "It is routine practice for many cardiac surgeons to probe internal mammary arteries to dilate them before their use. The effects of such probing on endothelium integrity, prostacyclin production, and vasodilation resulting from endothelium-derived relaxing factor and from prostacyclin were investigated in vessels isolated from mongrel dogs. Dose-dependent relaxation responses of isolated segments of probed and unprobed mammary arteries to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators methacholine, calcium ionophore (A23187), and melittin were determined in both the presence and absence of indomethacin. Prostacyclin production by probed versus unprobed vascular segments was determined under basal and A23187-stimulated conditions by radioimmunoassay for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and endothelial integrity was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Scanning electron micrographs of segments revealed marked endothelial cell disruption in probed versus unprobed vessels. The dose-dependent relaxation responses to all drugs studied were significantly impaired (p less than 0.05) in probed versus unprobed vessels in both the presence and absence of indomethacin. In addition, prostacyclin release as measured by production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was significantly (p less than 0.05) impaired in probed versus unprobed vessels under both basal and A23187-stimulated conditions. These results imply that routine probing of the internal mammary artery may damage endothelium, impair prostacyclin production, and impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation resulting from both prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

  ".W": "Ten dogs were subjected to defibrinogenation with an intravenous perfusion of ancrod (1 unit/kg) (Arvin, Knoll AG, Ludwigshafen, Federal Republic of Germany) over a 2 1/2 hour period. Six of them were subjected to extracorporeal elimination of carbon dioxide with a polypropylene membrane lung by means of veno-venous bypass. The remaining four dogs did not undergo extracorporeal circulation and served as control subjects. In both groups, ancrod administration itself resulted in a marked drop in alpha 2-antiplasmin (33% and 67%, respectively, of the baseline values) and in slight but significant decreases in factor II and plasminogen activities of 25% and 20%, respectively (p less than 0.05), in the group subjected to carbon dioxide removal. There were no significant changes in platelet number or factor V and antithrombin III activities. During the 6-hour bypass period, platelet count and antithrombin III and factor II and V levels decreased significantly. No bleeding was observed. Histologic examination of lung biopsy tissue showed no pathologic features. Analysis of the membrane of the artificial lungs revealed no fibrin deposits. In the control group, except for a drop in alpha 2-antiplasmin levels (54%), no significant changes in hemostatic parameters occurred during the corresponding 6 hours. We conclude that, despite the drop in coagulation factors and in alpha 2-antiplasmin activity during bypass, ancrod can be considered as a valuable alternative anticoagulant for extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal.\r"

  ".U": "89126469\r", 
  ".W": "After restoration of antegrade blood flow by coronary artery bypass grafting to a region of myocardium supplied by well-developed collateral vessels, there is regression of collateral supply to that region. There is controversy as to how rapidly this regression occurs, how soon collateral flow might return after an acute occlusion of the bypass graft, and how effective pharmacologic agents such as nitroglycerin might be in accelerating this return. To investigate this problem, 14 canine hearts were collateralized by Ameroid occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Regression and recovery of well-developed collateral function were studied after opening and closing an aorta-coronary bypass. Before bypass, peripheral coronary pressure was 82 +/- 2 mm Hg, retrograde flow 63 +/- 7 ml/min, collateral flow 21 +/- 2 ml/min, and collateral resistance 0.96 +/- 0.13 mm Hg/ml/min. One hundred minutes of bypass perfusion significantly decreased peripheral coronary pressure by 27%, retrograde flow by 52%, and collateral flow by 42%, and significantly increased collateral resistance by 319%. When the bypass was acutely occluded for 30 minutes, collateral resistance decreased spontaneously by 37%. When intracoronary nitroglycerin was administered for 5 minutes immediately after bypass occlusion, collateral resistance rapidly decreased by 72%, but subsequent collateral regression was not alleviated. Increased flow through regressed collateral vessels during retrograde flow diversion was associated with a decrease in collateral resistance. Results demonstrate rapid but not instantaneous regression and recovery of mature collateral function in response to requirements of collateral-dependent myocardium. Regressed collateral vessels can be dilated by nitroglycerin. Flow-dependent changes in collateral vascular tone appear to be responsible for early regression and recovery of collateral function.\r"

  ".W": "Because the pubertal growth spurt in boys appears to be mediated by both androgens and estrogens, we hypothesized that blockade of both androgen action and estrogen synthesis would normalize the growth of boys with familial male precocious puberty. To test this hypothesis, we studied nine boys (age range, 3.3 to 7.7 years) during treatment with an antiandrogen (spironolactone) or an inhibitor of androgen-to-estrogen conversion (testolactone), followed by treatment with both agents. After six months of observation without treatment, the first four boys received spironolactone for six months, followed by spironolactone and testolactone. The next five boys received testolactone for six months, followed by spironolactone and testolactone. Neither spironolactone nor testolactone, given alone, was satisfactory as a treatment for this condition. However, a combination of spironolactone and testolactone, given for at least six months, restored both the growth rate and the rate of bone maturation to normal prepubertal levels and controlled acne, spontaneous erections, and aggressive behavior. The combined therapy was associated with a significantly lower growth rate than testolactone alone (P less than 0.05) and a significantly lower rate of bone maturation than spironolactone alone (P less than 0.05). No important adverse effects were observed during combined treatment. Six of the nine boys continued to receive the combined therapy for an additional 12 months and maintained normal prepubertal rates of growth and bone maturation. The mean predicted height (+/- SEM) increased progressively during the combined treatment although the difference between the pretreatment and post-treatment predictions was not significant (169.5 +/- 2.8 at the end of treatment vs. 166.2 +/- 4.5 cm before treatment; P = 0.29). We conclude that blockade of both androgen action and estrogen synthesis with the combination of spironolactone and testolactone is an effective short-term treatment for familial male precocious puberty. Further study will be required, however, to assess the long-term outcome in boys who receive this treatment.\r"

We compared 16 normal women in the follicular phase, 5 normal men, 8 women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and 1 woman with polycystic ovary syndrome caused by a 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency. After 100 micrograms of nafarelin was given subcutaneously, serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone increased rapidly to peak levels within four hours. The women with polycystic ovary syndrome had a pattern similar to that of the men, with greater early luteinizing-hormone responses (30 minutes to 1 hour) and lower peak follicle-stimulating-hormone responses than normal women (P less than 0.05). Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome responded to gonadotropin stimulation with normal to increased production of plasma estrogens and increased levels of androstenedione at 16 to 24 hours (P less than 0.05). Elevated production of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone was found in all the women with polycystic ovary syndrome and in the men. These abnormal responses were unchanged by pretreatment with dexamethasone to suppress adrenal function. In the patient with the 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, both basal and stimulated plasma levels of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids before the enzymatic block were elevated, whereas plasma levels of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione--the steroids immediately beyond the block--were low. We conclude that women with polycystic ovary syndrome have masculinized pituitary and ovarian responses to stimulation by nafarelin. Our findings suggest that the regulation of the ovarian 17-hydroxylase and C-17,20-lyase activities is abnormal in such women.\r"

  ".W": "Canada and the United States have conducted a large-scale social experiment on the effects of alternative ways of funding expenditures for health care. Two very similar societies, with (until recently) very similar systems of providing health care, have adopted radically different systems of reimbursement. The results of this experiment are of increasing interest to Americans, because the Canadian approach has avoided or solved several of the more intractable problems facing the United States. In particular, overall health expenditures have been constrained to a stable share of national income, and universality of coverage (without user charges) eliminates the problems of uncompensated care, individual burdens of catastrophic illness, and uninsured populations. The combination of cost control with universal, comprehensive coverage has surprised some American observers, who have questioned its reality, its sustainability, or both. We present a comparison of the Canadian and American data on expenditures, identifying the sectors in which the experience of the two nations diverges most, and describing the processes of control. In any system, cost control involves conflict between providers and payers. Political processes focus this conflict, whereas market processes diffuse it. But the stylized political combat in Canada may result in less intrusion on the professional autonomy of the individual physician than is occurring in the United States.\r"

In lower vertebrates, disk assembly occurs with a diurnal rhythm with 2-4% of the outer segment length produced daily. We have discovered that in toad and fish retinas the level of mRNA for opsin, the most abundant protein in rod disks, fluctuates with a daily rhythm and is regulated both by light and by a circadian oscillator. The mRNA level rises before light onset, remains high during the light phase of a diurnal cycle and decreases four to tenfold during the dark phase. In constant darkness, mRNA elevation occurs during subjective daytime. At night, rod opsin mRNA can be elevated by exposure to light.\r"

The differential expression of the homoeotic genes of the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) and bithorax complex (BX-C), which determine segmental identities, is partly controlled by cross-regulatory interactions of loci within the two clusters and partly by trans-acting factors located outside the two complexes. One of the trans-regulatory genes, Polycomb (Pc), acts as a repressor of the ANT-C and BX-C. Mutations of Polycomb result in a complete depression of the homoeotic genes, leading to abdominal transformations of all body segments. Polycomb is part of a large class of trans-regulatory genes (Pc-group), estimated to comprise up to 40 loci. We have raised antibodies against the Polycomb protein, and, using an improved immunostaining technique, showed that the Polycomb protein binds to 60 discrete sites along the polytene chromosomes of salivary glands. These sites comprise the ANT-C and the BX-C as well as several locations of Pc-group genes. This is the first clear evidence for a direct interaction of Polycomb with homoeotic loci and other Pc-group genes.\r"

  ".U": "89127498\r", 
  ".W": "The enzyme peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) was recently discovered in mammalian tissues and purified from porcine kidney. It catalyses the slow cis-trans isomerization of proline peptide (Xaa-Pro) bonds in oligopeptides and accelerates slow, rate-limiting steps in the folding of several proteins. Here, we report the N-terminal sequence of PPIase together with further chemical and enzymatic properties. The results indicate that this enzyme is probably identical to cyclophilin, a recently discovered mammalian protein which binds tightly to cyclosporin A (CsA). Cyclophilin is thought to be linked to the immunosuppressive action of CsA. The first 38 amino-acid residues of porcine PPIase and of bovine cyclophilin are identical and the two proteins both have a relative molecular mass of about 17,000 (ref. 7). The catalysis of prolyl isomerization in oligopeptides and of protein folding by PPIase are strongly inhibited in the presence of low levels of CsA. The activities of both PPIase and cyclophilin depend on a single sulphydryl group. At present it is unknown whether the inhibition of prolyl isomerase activity is related with the immunosuppressive action of CsA.\r"

  ".U": "89127518\r", 
  ".W": "Arachidonic acid is released from cell membranes in response to receptor-dependent as well as receptor-independent stimulation in various cells, including cardiac myocytes. Arachidonic acid is converted to prostaglandins by cyclooxygenase and to leukotrienes by 5-lipoxygenase, metabolites which are very biologically active and modulate cellular functions such as platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction and neural excitation. The molecular mechanisms underlying their modulations are, however, still badly understood. Here, we report that the 5-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid activate the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-gated muscarinic K+ channel (IK.ACh): arachidonic acid activation of IK.ACh was prevented by the lipoxygenase inhibitors, nordihydroguaiaretic acid and AA-861; leukotriene A4 and C4 activated IK.ACh. The activation occurred in pertussis toxin-treated atrial cells and ceased when inside-out patches were formed but the patches were still susceptible to stimulation by GTP and to inhibition by GDP-beta-S. These results indicate that arachidonic acid metabolites may stimulate the G-protein in a receptor-independent way.\r"

  ".U": "89127519\r", 
  ".W": "Muscarinic receptors of cardiac pacemaker and atrial cells are linked to a potassium channel (IK.ACh) by a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. The dissociation of G-proteins leads to the generation of two potential transducing elements, alpha-GTP and beta gamma. IK.ACh is activated by G-protein alpha- and beta gamma-subunits applied to the intracellular surface of inside-out patches of membrane. beta gamma has been shown to activate the membrane-bound enzyme phospholipase A2 in retinal rods. Arachidonic acid, which is produced from the action of phospholipase A2 on phospholipids, is metabolized to compounds which may act as second messengers regulating ion channels in Aplysia. Muscarinic receptor activation leads to the generation of arachidonic acid in some cell lines. We therefore tested the hypothesis that beta gamma activates IK.ACh by stimulation of phospholipase A2. When patches were first incubated with antibody that blocks phospholipase A2 activity, or with the lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, beta gamma failed to activate IK.ACh. Arachidonic acid and several of its metabolites derived from the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, activated the channel. Blockade of the cyclooxygenase pathway did not inhibit arachidonic acid-induced channel activation. We conclude that the beta gamma-subunit of G-proteins activates IK.ACh by stimulating the production of lipoxygenase-derived second messengers.\r"

The octamer sequence motif 5'-ATGCAAAT-3', and its precise inverse, are strongly conserved in heavy- and light-chain gene promoters and are important determinants for the lymphoid-specific function of these promoters and of the heavy-chain enhancer. The heptameric sequence element with the consensus 5'-CTCATGA-3' (refs 3 and 4) is also required in addition to the octamer for full lymphoid-specific activity of heavy-chain promoters. Although these two elements have no sequence similarity, they are both recognized in vitro by the ubiquitous octamer transcription factor OTF-1 (reviewed refs 13 and 14) and the lymphoid-specific OTF-2 (reviewed in refs 15 and 16). Here we show that purified OTF-2 binds cooperatively to the immunoglobulin heptamer and octamer elements so that interaction with the octamer element facilitates binding of OTF-2 to the heptamer motif. More important, cooperativity in OTF-2 binding is closely mirrored by functional cooperation between the heptamer and octamer elements in activating transcription from the heavy-chain promoter in vitro.\r"

In this follow-up study (1985-1986), we have observed a nearly fivefold decrease in the incidence of hepatic fatality during a time when the overall use of valproate has increased significantly. The dramatically decreased incidence, from 0.93 per 10,000 (1/10,000) in 1978-1984 to 0.20 per 10,000 (1/49,000) in 1985-1986 appears to be due to changes in the prescribing patterns of physicians, prompted by greater awareness of low-risk versus high-risk patients. More patients are receiving valproate as monotherapy, considerably more low-risk patients are being treated with valproate, and fewer high-risk patients (0 to 2 years old) are being treated with valproate. During 1985-1986, no hepatic fatalities were reported in any patients above the age of 10 years, regardless of whether valproate was administered as monotherapy or polytherapy. The altered exposure pattern, with an increased use of monotherapy, appears to have had a positive impact on the number of hepatic fatalities (four among 198,000 patients treated during 1985-1986) and contributed to a decreased rate of valproate-associated hepatic fatality.\r"

Allelic sequence variation primarily affects the structure of the first external domains of alpha and beta component chains. Here we provide evidence for other types of allelic polymorphism for the genes encoding these chains. Sequences of two cDNA clones corresponding to HLA-DQB mRNAs from an HLA-homozygous cell line exhibit both alternative splicing and read-through of polyadenylylation. Furthermore, alternative splicing that deletes the transmembrane exon is associated with only a subset of HLA-DQB alleles, while the polyadenylylation-site read-through is found in a larger subset. This suggest that polymorphic cis-acting elements within the HLA-DQB gene control both processing steps. Proteins, presumably encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs lacking transmembrane exons, are immunoprecipitated with a monomorphic monoclonal antibody directed against HLA-DQ. These proteins are found in supernatants of cultured cell lines for which secretion is predicted, but not in those of cell lines that do not contain alternatively spliced mRNAs.\r"

Its physiological function is unknown, but in vitro studies suggest that Thy-1 may transmit activation signals to T cells and may play a role in the growth and/or differentiation of thymocytes [Kroczek, R. A., Gunter, K. C., Seligmann, B. & Shevach, E. M. (1986) J. Immunol. 136, 4379-4384; Kroczek, R. A., Gunter, K. C., Germain, R. N. & Shevach, E. M. (1986) Nature (London) 322, 181-184]. However, not all mouse thymocytes are Thy-1+ [Scollay, R., Wilson, A., D'Amico, A., Kelly, K., Egerton, M., Pearse, M., Wu, L. & Shortman, K. (1988) Immunol. Rev. 104, 81-120]. In addition, C3H-gld/gld mice accumulate large numbers of Thy-1- (and Thy-1+) T-cell antigen receptor-positive CD8- CD4- (double negative) T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. Our previous studies of these Thy-1- and Thy-1+ double negatives suggested that lack of Thy-1 expression correlated with diminished capacity to respond to T-cell stimuli. In this report, we describe a Thy-1- alpha/beta T-cell receptor-positive major histocompatibility complex-specific cytotoxic T-cell clone derived from C3H-gld/gld lymph node-residing cells. The data show that, at least in this system, Thy-1 (and CD8/CD4) expression is not required for growth, cytolytic activity, or expression of functional T-cell receptor complexes in vitro and raise the possibility that Thy-1 expression may not be obligatory in vivo for development of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors in gld mice.\r"

However, the exact mechanism of LDL oxidation has not been established. The present studies show that cellular lipoxygenase activity is involved in endothelial cell-induced oxidation of LDL. Inhibitors of lipoxygenase (but not inhibitors of cyclooxygenase) reduced LDL oxidation by as much as 70-85% under the conditions used. In contrast, the addition of pure (recombinant) superoxide dismutase inhibited by only approximately 25% under the same conditions. Oxidation of LDL by smooth muscle cells, on the other hand, was effectively inhibited by superoxide dismutase, as was Cu2+-catalyzed oxidation of LDL. When LDL was added to endothelial cell cultures within a dialysis bag, it did not undergo oxidative modification, suggesting that cell-LDL contact is necessary. We propose that an important element in cell-induced oxidation of LDL depends on (i) lipoxygenase oxidation of cellular lipids, followed by their exchange into LDL in the medium; (ii) direct lipoxygenase-dependent oxidation of LDL lipids during LDL-cell contact; (iii) or both.\r"

Little, however, is known about the cortical circuitry that underlies these functions in humans. In an attempt to learn more about these connections, we have traced projections of primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortex in the postmortem, fixed human brain, using the fluorescent dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate as an axonal marker. The results show that V1 makes a forward projection to layers 3 and 4 of V2, and V2 projects back to layers 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of V1. Some V2 injections also show an input to layer 4B of V1. Projections to 4B probably originate from cytochrome oxidase (CO)-reactive stripes that we have identified in V2. Differential connections between CO-rich (blobs) and CO-poor regions (interblobs) also exist within V1; blobs are connected to blobs and interblobs are connected to interblobs. The results show that the connections in human visual cortex are similar to those of nonhuman primates and that their organization is consistent with the concept of multiple processing streams in the visual system.\r"

Despite high nocturnal synthetic capacity, both melatonin content and release are low in the retina of the frog Xenopus laevis. We report here that cultured eyecups from Xenopus have the capacity for rapid metabolic breakdown of melatonin. Pharmacological analysis indicates that the initial step in this degradation pathway is deacetylation of melatonin by the enzyme aryl acylamidase (aryl-acylamide amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.13). This produces 5-methoxytryptamine, which is then deaminated by monoamine oxidase [amine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) (flavin-containing), EC 1.4.3.4], producing 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol. Inhibition of aryl acylamidase with eserine dramatically increases the release of endogenous melatonin by eyecups cultured at night, indicating that this pathway is the normal fate of retinal melatonin. Metabolism within the eye suggests a local neuromodulatory role for retinal melatonin, in contrast to the hormonal role of pineal melatonin.\r"

  ".W": "Combined use of chemical degradation, derivatization, and tandem mass spectrometry for rapid structural characterization of toxic cyclic peptides from blue-green algae at the nanomole level is described. Previously, all blue-green algal toxins were thought to belong to a family of seven-residue cyclic peptides, having the general structure cyclo-D-Ala-L-Xaa-erythro-beta-methyl-D-isoaspartic acid-L-Yaa-Adda-D-isoglutamic acid-N-methyldehydroalanine, where Xaa and Yaa represent variable amino acids of the L configuration and Adda is 3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyl-deca-4,6-dienoic acid. Structural characterization of two additional toxins indicates that further variability can exist within this family of naturally occurring toxic cyclic peptides. Isoaspartic acid and dehydroalanine can substitute for beta-methylisoaspartic acid and N-methyldehydroalanine, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Quiescent C3H-10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts that have not undergone any type of stress have a relatively low rate of 2-aminoisobutyrate (Aib) uptake by means of system A, which is primarily energized by the transmembrane Na+ chemical gradient potential. System A activity in these cells is not sensitive to ouabain or proton ionophores. In contrast, methylcholanthrene-transformed and confluent C3H-10T1/2 cells treated with 0.4 mM ouabain for 16-20 hr utilize the membrane potential generated by the Na+, K+-ATPase pump to drive Aib transport by means of system A as shown by the sensitivity of transport activity to ouabain and proton ionophores. Since glucose is present during the assay, the proton ionophores do not affect the availability of ATP, as indicated by the undiminished uptake of 86Rb+ by the Na+, K+-ATPase pump. As cells progress through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, they show an increased system A activity prior to entry into the S phase, which is also dependent on the electrogenicity of the Na+, K+-ATPase pump. There appears to be in all these cases a qualitative shift in the bioenergetic mechanism for the uptake of Aib as well as a marked quantitative increase in Aib uptake. The high activity after ouabain treatment was sustained in the transformed cells after removal of the ouabain, whereas in the confluent 10T1/2 cells the rate of uptake decayed rapidly, suggesting a difference in the mode of regulation. We conclude that transformed cells and normal cells in late G1 or under stress make use of the membrane potential generated by the Na+, K+-ATPase pump to drive amino acid uptake by means of system A.\r"

  ".U": "89128867\r", 
  ".W": "Phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor following activation of protein kinase C appears to negatively regulate EGF binding and the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity. We have identified two agents, the calcium ionophore A23187 and the non-phorbol tumor promoter thapsigargin, that similarly inhibit the EGF receptor binding and kinase activities through protein kinase C-independent pathways. Both agents activate protein kinases that phosphorylate the EGF receptor in A431 cells. To test the hypothesis that negative regulation of the EGF receptor always occurs through phosphorylation of threonine-654, a site uniquely phosphorylated by protein kinase C, we analyzed the tryptic phosphopeptides of EGF receptors isolated from cells treated with these agents. While limited phosphorylation of threonine-654 results from the A23187 treatment, no significant phosphorylation of this residue is detected after thapsigargin treatment. These results suggest that EGF receptor phosphorylation is a general mechanism for altering receptor properties and that site(s) of phosphorylation other than threonine-654 may negatively regulate the kinase activity as well as the binding of the EGF receptor.\r"

A 1.7-kilobase genomic clone contains a complete functional gene with two exons, encoding a 125-amino acid polypeptide of unknown function. The 5' flanking region of the gene contains a 13-base-pair IFN-stimulable response element (ISRE), homologous to the ISREs of the 6-16, ISG 15, and ISG 54 genes, which are predominantly inducible by IFN-alpha, beta. Analysis of constructs containing native and mutated ISREs suggests that this motif is essential for the response of 9-27 to IFN-gamma as well as IFN-alpha. Furthermore, the 9-27 (GGAAATAGAAACT) and 6-16 (GGGAAAATGAAACT) ISREs can each confer a response to both types of IFN when placed on the 5' side of a marker gene. Since the 6-16 gene does not normally respond to IFN-gamma, the context of the ISRE must determine the specificity of the response.\r"

In this paper, we report that these proteins are phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of RAS1 protein is demonstrated by treating with alkaline phosphatase as well as by labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. The phosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine residues and phosphorylated RAS1 protein is predominantly membrane localized. The phosphorylation of RAS2 protein is demonstrated by similar 32P-labeling experiments. The phosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine residues and phosphopeptide analyses suggest that only two major phosphorylated tryptic peptides are generated from the RAS2 protein. These results provide evidence for the phosphorylation of RAS proteins in vivo. Furthermore, our demonstration that the phosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine residues and that the RAS2 protein contains only two major phosphorylated tryptic peptides argues that the phosphorylation may be physiologically significant.\r"

West Nile virus infection of primary TGC monolayers from postcoital-day-3.5 preimplantation blastocysts induced paternal MHC antigen expression within 16 hr, as detected by immunogold labeling for electron microscopy. Induction is unlikely to have been mediated by secreted virus-induced interferons or other factors, as it occurred in the presence of high concentrations of anti-alpha/beta interferon antibodies and was not induced by virus-inactivated supernatants from MHC-induced primary TGC cultures. Attempts to induce MHC antigen expression with poly(I.C) or recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha in primary TGC cultures also failed. Thus, the apparent inhibition of MHC antigen expression in primary TGC during early implantation and their refractoriness to induction of de novo MHC antigen expression is not absolute. This may represent a maternal-and/or species-protective evolutionary device. As such, manipulation of this phenomenon may allow a conclusive assessment of the significance of inhibition of MHC antigen expression on trophoblast cells in the implanting semiallogeneic embryo.\r"

Cells exposed to arachidonic acid and the Ca2+ ionophore 23187 produced up to 180 times more LTs at the nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees C) than at the permissive temperature (37 degrees C). Induction of LT synthesis was detectable within 2 hr after temperature shift, whereas conventional macrophage markers became evident after 2-3 days. N-Formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, opsonized zymosan, and complement factor C5a induced LT synthesis in temperature-sensitive mutant-transformed cells only when the cells were maintained at 42 degrees C, and this effect was blocked by pertussis toxin. When cells were kept at 42 degrees C for 48 hr and then shifted back to 37 degrees C to induce retrodifferentiation, LT synthesis rates declined within 8 hr and reached near control values within 36 hr. Retrodifferentiation also led to decreased LT synthesis in response to N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, opsonized zymosan, and C5a. These results indicate that activation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway is a very early event in the macrophage differentiation pathway that is directly or indirectly controlled by the temperature-sensitive v-myb protein.\r"

We have developed a protocol for producing cytotoxic alloantisera in the cat following rejection of multiple surgical skin grafts. Of 59 cats subjected to grafting, 13 produced lymphocytotoxic antisera which had varying specificities among a panel of outbred cat cells. A population cluster analysis of the 13 alloantisera permitted the identification of six clusters of overlapping FLA specificities. Serological analysis of cells from 12 cat kindreds led to the definition of 24 allogeneic haplotypes, which segregate as a single Mendelian complex. Feline FLA antisera were characterized as class I or class II specific by immunoprecipitation of FLA gene products on lymphocyte cell surfaces. Abundant antigenic polymorphisms for both class I and class II MHC determinants were discovered, a result consistent with precedence in other species and the common expectation of the adaptive value of MHC variation. Development of feline MHC typing reagents and the definition of haplotypes for the cat hold promise for experimental analysis of valuable feline models for virus-induced immune deficiencies.\r"

In the putative antigen-recognition site, the rate of nonsynonymous substitution was found to exceed that of synonymous substitution, whereas in the second domain the former was significantly lower than the latter. In light of a previous theoretical study and parallel findings in class I MHC loci, we conclude that the unusually high degree of polymorphism at class II MHC loci is caused mainly by overdominant selection (heterozygote advantage) operating in the antigen-recognition site.\r"

In particular, such strains are killed by high-level expression of the LacZ hybrid protein. Previous results suggest that this overproduction phenotype is the consequence of a lethal jamming of the cellular protein export machinery and this hypothesis is supported by the observed accumulation of the precursor forms of many noncytoplasmic proteins within the moribund cell. Under conditions in which protein export is compromised, biochemical and immunocytochemical analyses indicate that these hybrid proteins can be found in transmembrane orientation. To identify the cellular component rendered rate-limiting by the LacZ hybrid protein under jamming conditions we have utilized signal sequence mutations, which block entry of the hybrid protein into the export pathway, and a dominant suppressor of these lesions, prlA4. Data obtained with a series of merodiploids heterozygous and homozygous for prlA+ and prlA4 show that PrlA is the component sequestered by hybrid jamming. Taken together, these results suggest that PrlA is a component of the export machinery that functions in the translocation of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane.\r"

We demonstrate that the mRNA is alternatively spliced so that an exon encoding a transmembrane domain is deleted. This gives rise to a 30-kDa molecule that is secreted and exists primarily as a monomer. mRNA corresponding to both forms is present in peripheral blood lymphocytes, Con A-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes, and three CD8+ T-cell lines, with the membrane form being the major species. However, differences in the ratio of mRNA for membrane CD8 and secreted CD8 exist. In addition, the splicing pattern we observe differs from the pattern found for the mouse CD8 gene. This mRNA is also alternatively spliced, but an exon encoding a cytoplasmic region is deleted, giving rise to a cell surface molecule that differs in its cytoplasmic tail from the protein encoded by the longer mRNA. Neither protein is secreted. This is one of the first examples of a different splicing pattern between two homologous mouse and human genes giving rise to very different proteins. This represents one mechanism of generating diversity during speciation.\r"

The PAI was higher (P less than .05) 4-6 hours after PTA compared with that on subsequent days. There was a trend toward greater platelet accumulation in vessels with extensive dissection. Platelet accumulation at the PTA site occurred with both doses of aspirin, with no differences between the two dosage groups. Twenty-one of 67 patients who underwent PTA in the femoropopliteal segment developed restenosis during a median follow-up of 14 months. The median PAI at 4-6 and 22-24 hours after PTA was significantly less in these 21 patients than in the 46 without restenosis. The data suggest that use of antiplatelet agents to prevent platelet deposition after PTA may not be useful for prevention of restenosis.\r"

A survey of 125 North American hospitals with experience in acute trauma care revealed that 96% obtain cervical radiographs as a routine or protocol study on all patients who have suffered major blunt trauma. To ascertain the cost-benefit effect of this practice, a prospective study was conducted during a 19-month period to compare the results of admission bedside clinical assessment of the cervical spine and the outcome of cervical radiography and computed tomography (CT) performed on 408 patients admitted with a history of major blunt trauma. Among these patients, there were 138 (34%) who were judged to be mentally alert and without symptoms referable to cervical spine injury. CT was performed after cervical radiography to adequately visualize the lower cervical spine (132 patients) or to clarify uncertain radiographic findings (six patients). One nondisplaced transverse process fracture of C-7 was detected (a prevalence of less than 1% of asymptomatic patients). The combined cost of cervical radiography and CT for the 138 asymptomatic patients was $59,202. These results call into question both the cost and clinical efficacy of routine or protocol-driven cervical spine imaging for all patients who have sustained major blunt trauma and support the value of careful bedside clinical assessment of the cervical spine in mentally alert blunt-trauma victims.\r"

It is also useful in treating the renovascular component of complex hypertension and may be indicated in severe renal artery stenosis (75%-99%), even in the absence of clinically demonstrable RVHTN. PTA has limited applications in the venous system and only short-term success in the treatment of stenoses in dialysis access fistulas. PTA often serves as an important adjunct to surgical revascularization by providing improved inflow or outflow. PTA is the procedure of choice when anatomically feasible in subclavian steal syndrome. The role of PTA in carotid artery disease, particularly atheromatous disease of the internal carotid artery, is uncertain. The same may be said of PTA for vertebral artery stenosis, although the overwhelming majority of vertebral artery stenoses are morphologically suitable for PTA. PTA and surgery are both effective in the treatment of abdominal angina. There are more data available to verify the long-term patency of thromboendarterectomy and bypass grafts than PTA for mesenteric ischemia. However, since the technical success for PTA is high and since coronary co-morbidity is the most common cause of perioperative mortality in surgical series, PTA should be seriously considered as the procedure of first choice. Serious complications of PTA occur in approximately 5% of cases. Two to three percent of PTA patients have complications requiring surgery or causing a prolongation or alteration of hospital course. The morbidity, mortality, and cost associated with PTA are low. The discomfort is minor, and postprocedural recovery rapid. The major limitations of PTA include its unsuitability for some lesions (long-segment occlusions and stenoses, orifice lesions, eccentric lesions) and postangioplasty restenosis. These problems are being addressed by ongoing laboratory and clinical research. In the near future, it is likely that endoluminal transmural sonography of the vessel wall will help guide our interventions.\r"

  ".W": "The RNA genome of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) appears to be made up of two parts: a small domain with a high degree of sequence conservation and structural features likely to promote replication; plus a second, larger domain that is less conserved and encodes the delta antigen. This report focuses on one of the several sets of data that have led to the proposal of this model: the existence of a novel structural element in HDV genomic RNA. This structural element lies within the highly conserved domain of HDV RNA and may be related to the local tertiary structure previously mapped to the central conserved region of the plant viroid genome. Both elements occur in regions with no apparent coding capacity and are distinctively responsive to ultraviolet (UV) light. Transcripts containing partial and full-length genomic sequences of HDV readily undergo a UV-induced crosslinking reaction, which establishes a covalent bond between two noncontiguous segments. By locking two segments of the overall structure into place, this crosslink has permitted the unbranched, rodlike model of HDV RNA to be examined and confirmed in the portion of the RNA analyzed. The clustering of the novel tertiary structure and the recently discovered self-cleavage sites into a highly conserved, but apparently noncoding, portion of the genome defines a viroid-like domain in HDV RNA and raises questions about the possible events leading up to the association of free-living RNAs with messenger RNAs and other RNA molecules.\r"

A low molecular weight endogenous peptide has been isolated and purified from rat brain. This peptide regulates up and down the cardiac and neuronal calcium channels, respectively. In cardiac myocytes, the peptide-induced enhancement of the L-type calcium current had a slow onset (half-time approximately 75 seconds), occurred via a G protein-independent mechanism, and could not be inhibited by alpha 1-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, or angiotensin II blockers. In neuronal cells, on the other hand, the negative effect had a rapid onset (half-time less than 500 milliseconds) and was observed on both T-type and L-type calcium channels.\r"

An IL-2 inducible B lymphoma line, in which the growth and differentiation responses are uncoupled, provides a model system for dissecting the signaling mechanisms operating in each response. This system was used to show that both signals are initiated by IL-2 binding to a single, unifunctional receptor complex. Moreover, both signals are transduced by a pathway that does not involve any known second messenger system and that can be blocked by a second T cell lymphokine, interleukin 4. These findings suggest that the pleiotrophic effects of IL-2 are determined by different translations of the signal in the nucleus.\r"

Eight to ten such G proteins couple a large number of receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters to at least eight different effectors. Although one G protein can interact with several receptors, a given G protein was thought to interact with but one effector. The recent finding that voltage-gated calcium channels are stimulated by purified Gs, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase, challenged this concept. However, purified Gs may have four distinct alpha-subunit polypeptides, produced by alternative splicing of messenger RNA. By using recombinant DNA techniques, three of the splice variants were synthesized in Escherichia coli and each variant was shown to stimulate both adenylyl cyclase and calcium channels. Thus, a single G protein alpha subunit may regulate more than one effector function.\r"

Extensive SBS was defined as a residual jejunoileum that was 25% or less than the normal expected length for each infant's gestational age. The cause of the SBS included gastroschisis (5), jejunal atresia (5), necrotizing enterocolitis (2), midgut volvulus (1), and congenital SBS (1). Infants had a mean residual jejunoileal length of 32 cm, which represented an average of 16% of normal expected jejunoileal length for gestational age. The most significant complications were associated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN): catheter sepsis (13/14 infants); cholestasis (8/14); central venous thrombosis (4/14); and cholelithiasis (3/14). The survival rate was 86%; two infants died of end-stage liver disease. Eight of 12 survivors (67%) have had intestinal adaptation develop and have discontinued TPN; three are maintained with combined TPN-enteral feeding; and one receives only TPN. Mean cost of the initial hospitalization was $315,000 with an average stay of 450 days. Survival and eventual enteral alimentation may be expected for most neonates with extensive SBS despite significant morbidity.\r"

Aggregates of hepatocytes and pancreatic islets were obtained from Wistar-Furth rats by an automated method of collagenase digestion. Approximately 8000 Wistar-Furth hepatocyte clusters (100 to 300 micron diameter) were transplanted beneath the renal capsule of Lewis rats with or without the addition of 800 pancreatic islets. Recipients received subcutaneous injections of cyclosporine A (CsA): 30 mg/kg on days 0, 1, and 2, 10 mg/kg on days 3 to 7, and 10 mg/kg every other day for days 8 to 28. In the absence of CsA recipient treatment, all the allografts were rejected within 7 days. The combined hepatocyte-islet allografts in recipients treated with CsA showed maintenance of morphologic integrity of both hepatocytes and islet cells 1, 2, and 4 weeks after transplantation, whereas in the absence of pancreatic islets, the hepatocellular aggregates degenerated despite CsA treatment, leaving only a thin rim of hepatocytes immediately adjacent to the renal parenchyma. It can be concluded that in immunosuppressed recipients hepatocyte-islet renal subcapsular allografts survived despite the presence of an intact liver, which indicates a possible role of trophic factors released locally from the islets.\r"

Angioscopy provided a cross-sectional view of the vessel lumen with clear visualization of the thrombus. Thirty minutes after nt-PA infusion, the percent luminal obstruction decreased from 74 to 61 in nt-PA alone (p less than .025), from 77 to 37 in nt-PA plus heparin (p less than .005), and from 79 to 25 in nt-PA plus batroxobin (p less than .005). Fifteen minutes after drug infusion, plasma fibrinogen levels decreased to 89% of preinfusion value in nt-PA alone, to 84% in nt-PA plus heparin, and to less than 5% in nt-PA plus batroxobin.

  ".W": "Twenty patients with recurrent symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia were studied to estimate the efficacy of flecainide in the long-term treatment of these arrhythmias and to evaluate the prognostic value of programmed electrophysiologic stimulation. All patients had their arrhythmia inducible at baseline evaluation. Nine patients had a Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, five had a concealed bypass tract, and two had dual atrioventricular (AV) nodal pathways. In the remaining patients there was an intraatrial reentry circuit. Previous medication was no to five antiarrhythmic drugs (mean 2.4 drugs). At baseline, a circus movement tachycardia was induced in 12, AV nodal tachycardia was induced in two, atrial tachycardia was induced in three, atrial fibrillation was induced in five, and a flutter was induced in two patients. After flecainide, 2 mg/kg intravenously in 10 minutes, six patients no longer had their arrhythmia inducible. In the WPW patients, atrial fibrillation was no more inducible. In 65% of the patients there was no recurrence during a follow-up period of 11 +/- 10 months. None of the six patients who no longer had their arrhythmia inducible had a recurrence of the tachycardia over a period of up to 3 years. Seven of the other 14 patients (who still had their arrhythmia inducible) had a recurrence of the tachycardia. Positive and negative predictive values are 50% and 100%, respectively. We conclude that flecainide prevents recurrences of supraventricular tachycardias in 65% of patients with inducible supraventricular tachycardias during a mean follow-up of 11 months. Programmed electrical stimulation has a high negative predictive value in this setting. Flecainide is especially effective in preventing atrial fibrillation in patients with WPW syndrome.\r"

However, physiologic effects of this endogenous ANH have not been demonstrated. To determine whether the rise in ANH during SVT is associated with either a natriuresis or kaliuresis, urine sodium and potassium levels were measured in five patients at baseline and during SVT simulated by rapid atrioventricular pacing. Plasma ANH levels increased from 149 +/- 35 pmol/L at baseline to 187 +/- 31 pmol/L (p = 0.007) during SVT. Plasma vasopressin and renin levels were unchanged. Urine sodium levels increased 49% from 1.54 +/- 0.66 mEq/hr at baseline to 2.29 +/- 0.89 mEq/hr (p = 0.044) during SVT, and urine potassium levels increased 22% from 4.14 +/- 0.10 mEq/hr to 5.04 +/- 1.25 mEq/hr (p = 0.018). Urine sodium and potassium levels returned to baseline values 1 hour after pacing. Thus elevated plasma levels of ANH during SVT are associated with both a natriuresis and kaliuresis, which may represent physiologic effects of the endogenously secreted hormone.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels, which were elevated before the valvuloplasty, decreased significantly in all 10 patients at 15 minutes after the valvuloplasty and reached lower plateaus at 30, 45, and 60 minutes after the procedure. In the seven patients studied for a longer period, both plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels and the left atrial pressure remained reduced 24 hours after the valvuloplasty. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels before and 30 to 60 minutes after the valvuloplasty were positively correlated to simultaneously determined left and right atrial pressures. These results indicate that atrial stretch caused by increased atrial pressure is an important stimulus for atrial natriuretic peptide release in man. \"De-stretching\" of the myocytes of the atria results in rapid inhibition of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether heart rate contributes to release of three new peptide hormones synthesized in the heart, right ventricular pacing at rates of 100, 125, 150, and 180 bpm was performed in six dogs with measurement of the plasma concentration of these peptides at each pacing rate while right atrial and systemic blood pressures were simultaneously monitored. These three peptides of the 126-amino-acid prohormone of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), consisting of amino acids 1-30 (pro ANF 1-30), 31-67 (pro ANF 31-67), and 99-126 (ANF), increased incrementally at paced heart rates of 125, 150, and 180 bpm (r = 0.8, p less than 0.001). Right atrial pressure decreased with increasing heart rate but systemic blood pressure did not decrease until the heart rate was 180 bpm, at which time these peptides had obtained their maximal circulating concentrations. After pacing, mean right atrial pressure and levels of ANF returned to prepacing values within 30 minutes. Mean arterial blood pressure, on the other hand, increased throughout the 120-minute period after pacing. At 2 hours after pacing, levels of pro ANFs 1-30 and 31-67 were elevated compared with prepacing values. These data demonstrate that, at heart rates of 125 bpm and above, pro ANF 1-30, pro ANF 31-67, and ANF (99-126) are simultaneously and incrementally released in direct proportion to heart rate. The sustained elevation in pro ANFs 1-30 and 31-67 seen 2 hours after pacing suggests that they may contribute to the prolonged diuresis seen after cardiac pacing or tachycardia.\r"

Sixty-one of 502 patients (12%) required hospitalization for CHF in the 1-year follow-up.

  ".W": "The present study investigated whether the lack of enzyme increase is reason enough to exclude necrosis in patients with ischemic heart disease who develop electrocardiographic sustained ST-T changes in the absence of Q waves. In 15 consecutive patients with angina who developed sustained ST-T changes during hospitalization, the presence of myocardial necrosis was investigated by a prospective multiparametric approach. Serum enzymes and myoglobin, pyrophosphate uptake, 2-dimensional echocardiography, perfusion scintigraphy, left ventriculography and coronary angiography were evaluated. According to creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB peak at twice the upper normal value, the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction applied only to 40% of patients. However, myoglobin was positive in 80% and a perfusion defect could be documented by an electrocardiographic gated microsphere technique in 100% of patients. The positivity of myoglobin increased to 100% and of creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB to 87 and 60%, respectively, when a peak value twice the individual lowest value was considered for positivity. The 100% presence of perfusion defects associated with the high prevalence of both positive pyrophosphate uptake (87%) and regional dyssynergies (87 and 73%, respectively, by left ventriculography and echocardiography) strongly suggest that sustained (greater than or equal to 7 days) ST-T changes in this population were indicative of myocardial necrosis. Thus, by conventional enzymatic approach, diagnosis of non-Q-wave infarction can be missed in a sizable number of patients and present important clinical implications.\r"

  ".W": "The antianginal efficacies of nifedipine (40 to 120 mg/day) and diltiazem (120 to 360 mg/day) were studied in 21 normotensive patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Patients received each agent titrated to maximum tolerated doses for 6 weeks, after a 2-week placebo baseline period. The maximum tolerated dose for nifedipine was 72 +/- 8 (standard error) mg/day and for diltiazem 297 +/- 20 mg/day. Two patients discontinued nifedipine early because of side effects. Duration of symptom-limited treadmill exercise was longer during the nifedipine (556 +/- 43 seconds) and diltiazem periods (546 +/- 39 seconds) compared with placebo baseline (474 +/- 41 seconds, p less than 0.02). Compared with placebo, nifedipine caused a significant increase in heart rate both at rest standing and at peak exercise. Nifedipine decreased resting systolic blood pressure but had no effect at peak exercise. In contrast, diltiazem caused a significant decrease in heart rate at rest but had no effect on blood pressure at rest or at peak exercise. Thus, nifedipine and diltiazem have differential effects on heart rate and systolic blood pressure suggesting different modes of action. However, despite the increase in exercise duration, neither nifedipine nor diltiazem increased the heart rate-systolic pressure product during maximum exercise. This suggests that the antianginal effects of the 2 agents probably are mediated via reduction of myocardial oxygen demand at submaximal exercise. In addition, diltiazem appears to be better tolerated than nifedipine.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the association of qualitative and quantitative measurements of the myocardial infarct-related coronary narrowing with subsequent recurrent ischemia/reocclusion after successful thrombolysis, 47 patients treated with high-dose (150 mg) tissue plasminogen activator over 6 to 8 hours were studied in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. No patient underwent emergent coronary angioplasty. All patients had Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 2 flow or higher at the baseline (90-minute) angiogram; 31 patients had a protocol 24-hour catheterization as well. Eighteen patients had recurrent ischemia/reocclusion whereas 29 had an uneventful hospital course. There was no significant difference in baseline clinical characteristics between the 2 groups. Twenty-five (86%) of those with an uneventful course had TIMI grade 3 flow at baseline angiogram compared with 56% of patients with recurrent events. No significant difference in angiographic morphologic characteristics was found between the 2 groups at baseline catheterization. At 24 hours, however, none of the patients who subsequently had recurrent events had a concentric narrowing, while 13 (58%) of them had a complex morphology. In contrast, quantitative parameters of minimal lumen diameter, percent area stenosis and percent diameter stenosis at baseline and 24 hours were not significantly different between those who did and did not have recurrent ischemia/reocclusion. These findings suggest that the degree and quality of coronary flow at baseline catheterization are more important determinants of sustained patency and event-free hospitalization than are quantitative dimensions or coronary morphology. In addition, narrowings that fail to become concentric within the first 24 hours are more likely to be associated with subsequent ischemia or reocclusion during the early periinfarct period.\r"

Before starting the exercise, a right-sided cardiac catheterization was performed to measure hemodynamic parameters before and during exercise. All patients had normal increases in cardiac output for the level of exercise performed and the peripheral vascular resistance diminished appropriately. An increase in the right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressures during exercise could be explained by increased venous return. After the baseline testing, rest and exercise hemodynamics were repeated 2 hours after the administration of 400 mg of dilevalol, a new beta blocker. For the next 2 weeks the patients received 400 mg of the study drug twice a day, with repeat studies obtained thereafter. As with other beta blockers, dilevalol decreases the heart rate and cardiac output on exercise, but, in addition, it induces a decrease in the resting systemic vascular resistance. This action is similar to its isomer, labetalol.\r"

Because eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), found in menhaden oil, competitively inhibits cyclooxygenase, we fed two groups of guinea pigs diets, in which the fat source was either menhaden or safflower oil, for 6 wk. A third group was allowed the safflower oil diet ad libitum. Menhaden oil-fed animals showed enhanced survival compared with safflower oil control animals 20 h after endotoxin (87 vs 63%, p less than 0.05). Ad libitum-fed safflower oil animals survived least well, with 47% alive at 20 h (p less than 0.005 vs menhaden oil group). We conclude that feeding animals a diet whose predominant lipid source is fish oil significantly improves survival after endotoxin. Dietary fat should be viewed not only as a caloric source but as a pharmacologically active substance that can have profound effects on the host's response to toxic insults.\r"

On day 11, a 4-h infusion of L-carnitine (125 mumol/kg) was performed in both groups. The effect of supplementation was evaluated by indirect calorimetry, N balance, and repeated measurements of plasma lipids and ketone bodies. Irrespective of continuous or acute supplementation, respiratory quotient and fat oxidation were similarly maintained throughout the study in both groups whereas N balance appeared to be more favorable without carnitine. We conclude that carnitine-supplemented TPN does not improve fat oxidation or promote N utilization in the postoperative phase.\r"

Acute hypervitaminosis A may occur after ingestion of greater than or equal to 500,000 IU (over 100 times the RDA) by adults or proportionately less by children. Symptoms are usually reversible on cessation of overdosing. Factors influencing chronic hypervitaminosis A include dosing regimen, physical form of the vitamin, general health status, dietary factors such as ethanol and protein intake, and interactions with vitamins C, D, E, and K. Both excess and deficiency of vitamin A in pregnant animals was shown to be teratogenic. In humans, congenital malformations associated with maternal over-use of high doses of vitamin A were reported but no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Deficiency of the vitamin during pregnancy has also been associated with congenital abnormalities. Reported incidences of vitamin A toxicity are rare and have averaged fewer than 10 cases per year from 1976 to 1987.\r"

Ca absorption was measured by a double-isotope technique and the kinetic indices were obtained by a deconvolution method.

With (+), Ca absorption in NL subjects was identical with that from water solution; in LD subjects it increased (23%, p less than 0.02).

Microscopic observation of sperm was found in 33 (13%) of the 260 samples, with 50% of the boys exhibiting sperm in at least one specimen. No further cumulative gain in detecting spermaturia occurred after the seventh urine collection. The median age of spermarche was computed by logistic regression analysis to be 14 years. Three urine collections from each boy were assessed for gonadotropin levels. At age 14 years mean follicule-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone excretion were, respectively, 857 and 503 mIU/h, into the reported adult daytime range. Spermarche is a midpubertal event associated with age-appropriate gonadotropin production.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if high-frequency jet ventilation is beneficial in neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension, we compared the ventilator settings, blood gas concentrations, and outcome of infants who met established criteria for a high predictive mortality. During a six-year period, 14 neonates who had severe respiratory failure and hypoxemia while receiving conventional ventilation were treated with high-frequency jet ventilation. Twenty-three comparable infants meeting the same criteria were treated exclusively with conventional ventilation. After initiation of high-frequency jet ventilation there was a significant reduction in mean airway pressure and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2). In contrast, neonates treated exclusively with conventional ventilation continued to have higher airway pressures and PaCO2. However, there was no difference in the alveolar-to-arterial oxygen gradient, air leakage, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or duration of assisted ventilation or oxygen supplementation. Furthermore, mortality was comparable in both groups of infants. These preliminary observations suggest that high-frequency jet ventilation can reduce airway pressure and PaCO2 in neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension but does not appear to improve outcome.\r"

Currently, many states have adopted diagnosis related group (DRG) prospective \"all payer systems\" using the federal model. All payer systems, whereby Medicaid, Blue Cross, and other commercial insurers pay by the DRG mode, prevent cost shifting between payers. New York state has used an all payer system since Jan 1, 1988. This study simulated DRG all payer methods for a large sample (N = 16,084) of pediatric patients for a three-year period using the New York DRG all payer reimbursement system now in effect. Medicaid pediatric patients had (adjusted for DRG weight index) a longer hospital stay and greater total hospital cost compared with pediatric patients from Blue Cross and other commercial payers. Medicaid pediatric patients also had a greater severity of illness compared with patients from Blue Cross and other payers. Pediatric patients in all payment groups (ie, Medicaid, Blue Cross, and other commercial insurers) generated financial risk under the DRG all payer scheme. Medicaid pediatric patients generated the greatest financial risk, however. These data suggest that state and private payers may be under-reimbursing for the care of the hospitalized pediatric patient using the DRG prospective hospital payment scheme. Health care financing policy for pediatric patients may limit both access and quality of care.\r"

Intravenous infusions of either prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (n = 5) or placebo (n = 5) were begun after 60 minutes of stable pulmonary hypertension. The effects of these interventions on cardiopulmonary hemodynamics were studied. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) increased similarly in both groups during the first 60 minutes of GBS infusion. By two hours after intervention, PAP was significantly lower in the animals given PGE1 (20 +/- 4 vs 32 +/- 5 mm Hg for PGE1 vs placebo). The ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance followed a pattern analogous to PAP, increasing with the GBS infusion, indicating selective pulmonary vasoconstriction. The pulmonary vascular resistance/systemic vascular resistance ratio decreased after intervention in the group given PGE1 only (0.25 +/- 0.08 vs 0.50 +/- 0.12 for PGE1 vs placebo), indicating selective pulmonary vasodilation. Transient systemic hypotension was noted at one hour after initiation of PGE1 infusion. Prostaglandin E1 infusion selectively improved GBS-induced pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia in newborn piglets with only transient systemic hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "A major cause of anxiety in parents of hospitalized children is insufficient information about hospital procedures. In an effort to determine the extent to which parental anxiety could be diminished and knowledge and satisfaction enhanced in regard to total parenteral nutrition (TPN), we developed a booklet that describes the mechanics of TPN administration and related procedures. When informal discussions were held between parents and members of the nutritional support team during four alternating periods (every five to six months), parents of first-time recipients of TPN either did not receive the booklet (period 1, n = 20; period 3, n = 30) or received it (period 2, n = 23; period 4, n = 27). Within one week of TPN initiation, parents in both groups completed the Spielberger State-Trait anxiety scale, an attitude questionnaire, and a quiz on TPN. No differences between groups were found in ethnic background, socioeconomic status, severity of illness, age of children, or route of TPN administration. Predisposition to anxiety was also similar between the groups. In contrast, acute situational anxiety was significantly greater in the group with no booklet than in the booklet group. Parents in the no-booklet group demonstrated less comfort in the care of their children and less knowledge about TPN than did the booklet group. Written information provided to parents decreased their anxiety and increased satisfaction with patient care more successfully than did verbal communication. Such a booklet may reduce parentally induced anxiety in the child and facilitate parent-hospital staff interactions.\r"

The cDNA encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha-subunit from his lymphocytes, transformed by infection of Epstein-Barr virus, was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence determination revealed that the gene had a deletion of four nucleotides at the second codon upstream from the termination codon. This deletion would lead to a reading-frame shift and make a new termination codon at the 33d codon downstream from the \"normal\" termination codon. An S1 nuclease-protection experiment confirmed the presence of mRNA with its deletion in the patient. Amplification, by the polymerase chain reaction method, of the genomic-DNA region from his peripheral blood cells showed that the deletion was localized in an exon and that it was not caused by an abnormal splicing at the intron/exon junction. This is the first report on cloning a defective gene of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.\r"

Ia antigen expression was induced on isolated B10.BR murine islet parenchymal cells by culturing them for 5 days with lymphokine supernatants containing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or with recombinant murine IFN-gamma + recombinant tumor necrosis factor. Ia positivity was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. Islets cultured for 5 days without cytokines were Ia-negative. Purified B10.BR islets allografted into the portal veins of C57BL/6J mice do not reject, which allowed the authors to determine whether aberrant expression of Ia on parenchymal cells has a deleterious effect on allograft survival. Ia-positive or Ia-negative islets were transplanted via the portal vein into diabetic C57BL/6J mice. All mice remained normoglycemic until they were killed at 30 to 60 days. Well-granulated islet allografts were identified histologically in all mice. The experiment was repeated using Balb/cJ mice as donors. Purified Balb/cJ islets are rapidly rejected by C57BL/6J mice. Induction of Ia expression on Balb/cJ islets significantly improved allograft survival. These findings indicate that Ia-positive islet cells do not induce rejection in these allograft models but may actually have a protective effect.\r"

One day after exposure to dengue virus, the cell-associated PAI-2 activity in the infected monocytes was 562 +/- 9 mU/10(6) cells (mean +/- SE) compared to 206 +/- 56 mU/10(6) cells for uninfected monocytes. Supernatants of the infected cells also showed greater than 2-fold increase in PAI-2 activity. This increase in cell-associated and supernatant PAI-2 activity was maintained during 4 days of culture. UK activity was not detected in control and infected cells nor in their supernatants. PCA activity was the same in control and dengue virus infected monocytes when measured during 4 days of culture.

No correlation was found between egg excretion and antibody levels against the circulating antigens. Antigen was detectable only in patients excreting greater than 500 eggs per gram of feces.\r"

  ".W": "Baboons (Papio anubis) were injected in the leg muscle with 18,000 20 Krad irradiated schistosomula of Schistosoma haematobium. Four protocols were followed: single, primary injection; single injection into animals primed by patent S. haematobium infection; secondary vaccine injection following an earlier injection; and single injection following praziquantel treatment of infected animals. Injection of the putative vaccine elicited localized mixed inflammatory infiltration at the site of injection which was both intense and prolonged. Three grades of tissue reaction were seen: the relatively mild primary response; the response in infected animals which had enhanced tissue eosinophilia; and the response in animals primed by prior injection and drug-treated prior infection. The latter 2 showed intensification of eosinophilia, stellate abscesses in the lesion centers, and perischistosomular Hoeppli precipitates. Intramuscular lesions peaked at 14 days for the primary response and at 7 days for all secondary responses. Traces of the milder lesions persisted beyond 4 weeks; more severe reactions healed more rapidly. Some schistosomula survived for 14 days in the milder reactions. A few larvae were deposited in the skin by backflushing of the injectate which produced local inflammation. Compared to mice, live schistosome vaccines injected into baboons elicited greater local inflammation; however, while evidence suggested that sporadic vaccine schistosomula did reach the lymphatic nodes draining the injection sites, no systemic lesions were found and the injection sites healed in approximately 5-6 weeks without permanent damage.\r"

Nude mice formed small granulomas that were poor in eosinophils and connective tissue. Nude mice reconstituted with cells enriched for L3T4+ or Lyt2+ cells formed granulomas similar in size to those in intact mice, but granulomas in mice given Lyt2+ cells contained few eosinophils and had significantly less collagen than did granulomas in mice given L3T4+ cells. The same was true at 10 weeks. Mice reconstituted with null cells were examined at 7 weeks and formed granulomas similar to those in mice given Lyt2+ cells. By 10 weeks after infection, granulomas had decreased to the same minute size in all groups of mice. Fibrosis increased at weeks 7-10 in all groups of mice.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that hospitalized patients referred to a general surgical service from a medical service for a surgical procedure would have higher hospital costs and longer lengths of stay per diagnosis-related group (DRG) than patients admitted directly to the general surgical service. Hospital costs by DRG, exclusive of physician's fees, were analyzed for all adult general surgical admissions treated at our hospital from January 1, 1985 to March 31, 1986 (3,028 patients) to yield a population of patients in those DRGs with patients referred to general surgery from medicine (1,495 patients). Patients within each DRG were then disaggregated by either direct admission to general surgery (1,412 patients) or referral to the general surgical service from the medical service (83 patients). Mean cost per patient was 146.5 percent higher for referral patients than for direct admission patients, as was the total length of stay. Mortality was higher for referral patients than for direct admission patients. Factors analyzed which contributed to this greater resource utilization and higher mortality were (1) a greater severity of illness, (2) higher diagnostic costs, and (3) delays in diagnosis or treatment. The DRG payment for referral patients also produced a substantial deficit for the hospital, whereas direct admission patients produced a profit of +1,105,596. This data suggests that direct admission to the surgical service of patients likely to need surgery might lower their hospital costs and improve the quality of their care.\r"

PEG can, however, be associated with serious complications and death. This is a report of three patients who developed life-threatening abdominal wall abscesses and four patients who died after PEG insertion. The patients ranged in age from 30 to 80 years, four female and three male. Complicating medical conditions included cirrhosis, diabetes, heart-lung transplantation, neurological dysfunction, and psychosis. The four patients who died were all noted to have had unsatisfactory adhesion between the gastric serosa and the anterior abdominal wall, resulting in large gastric defects where the PEG had been placed and intraperitoneal contamination with gastric contents and feedings. Three additional patients developed abdominal wall abscesses requiring operative debridement. The patient considered to be high risk for surgical gastrostomy may be a higher risk for PEG. Alternatives to PEG should be considered in patients with poor nutritional status or debilitating medical conditions, or in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and steroid use. Psychosis and dementia should be considered relative contraindications to PEG because these patients may dislodge the gastrostomy tube, resulting in severe wound infection and, possibly, death.\r"

DESIGN: Before-and-after trial with 3-month treatment periods. SETTING: Outpatient lipid clinic at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Sixteen patients with hypertriglyceridemia recruited from the General Internal Medicine Clinics. Five had concomitant hypercholesterolemia (type IIb). INTERVENTION: Fish oil supplementation at two doses. After basal measurements, 9.8 g/d omega-3 fatty acids were provided for study months 1 to 3, and 3.9 g/d were provided for study months 4 to 6. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood was drawn monthly and plasma was analyzed for levels of triglycerides, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1, and glucose and glycohemoglobin. During therapy with the higher dose, mean plasma triglyceride levels were reduced from 3.65 +/- 0.35 mmol/L at baseline to 1.85 +/- 0.20 mmol/L at 1 month, but increased by 30% to 2.40 +/- 0.30 mmol/L by the third month of therapy (P less than 0.05): this increase could not be explained by changes in body weight or compliance. Plasma triglyceride levels continued to increase with low-dose therapy and remained only 11% below baseline values by the sixth month of therapy (P = not significant). Although fish oil therapy increased HDL cholesterol levels (+18% at high dose; 99% CI, 5% to 31%), favorable changes were not seen in LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, or apolipoprotein A1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil concentrate at high doses followed by low-dose maintenance therapy cannot sustain the initial large plasma triglyceride reductions. Moreover, the efficacy of the higher dose becomes less pronounced after the first month of therapy. This reduced efficacy during prolonged therapy, and the lack of beneficial effect on apolipoprotein and LDL cholesterol levels, may limit the practical benefit of fish oil in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, open-label, preliminary trial of methotrexate along with standard medications for 12 weeks. SETTING: Referral-based gastroenterology practice. PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients with refractory inflammatory bowel disease (14, Crohn disease; 7, chronic ulcerative colitis); 17 taking variable doses of corticosteroids and 14 on sulfasalazine or metronidazole. Of the 21 patients, 10 had previously failed azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine trials. INTERVENTIONS: Sulfasalazine and metronidazole were continued and prednisone dose was tapered according to clinical response. Methotrexate was given as a 25-mg intramuscular injection weekly for 12 weeks, then switched to a tapering oral dose if a clinical and objective improvement was noted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen of twenty-one patients (11 of 14 patients with Crohn disease, 5 of 7 patients with chronic ulcerative colitis) had an objective response as measured by disease activity indices (modified Crohn's Disease Activity Index, 13.3 to 5.4 [P = 0.0001], Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index, 13.3 to 6.3 [P = 0.007]). Prednisone dosage decreased from 21.4 mg +/- 5.6 (SEM) to 5.5 mg +/- 2.0; P = 0.006 and 38.6 mg +/- 6.35 to 12.9 mg +/- 3.4; P = 0.01, respectively. Five patients with Crohn colitis had colonoscopic healing and 4 had normal histology at 12 weeks. In contrast, none of the 7 patients with ulcerative colitis had normal flexible sigmoidoscopies, despite histologic improvement in 5. Side effects included mild rises in transaminase levels in 2 patients, transient leukopenia in 1, self-limited diarrhea and nausea in 2 patients, and 1 case each of brittle nails and atypical pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: Although this pilot study is encouraging, further work is needed before methotrexate can be recommended for inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1975 to 1988) and extensive bibliographic reviews of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed the literature and selected 169 articles considered most relevant for the definition of the endocrinologic abnormalities, elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms, or delineation of therapeutic interventions. DATA EXTRACTION: The authors independently assessed study quality and data concerning endocrinologic abnormalities, pathogenic mechanisms, and therapy of the polycystic ovary syndrome. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: The polycystic ovary syndrome may be best defined as functional, gonadotropin-dependent ovarian hyperandrogenism. The polycystic ovary syndrome results when a primary defect increases one of three variables: the ratio of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone to follicle stimulating hormone, the ratio of the intraovarian concentrations of androgen to estrogen, or follicular atresia. An increase in one of these variables can then induce successive abnormalities in one or more of the remaining two variables in a to-and-fro manner. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that several causes exist, each of which can produce the clinical syndrome by a to-and-fro interaction among pathogenic mechanisms. Treatment objectives for the syndrome include amelioration of hirsutism, induction of ovulation, and weight reduction.\r"

Despite recommendations by federal advisory committees, the secretary of Health and Human Services has proposed no major changes to DRGs along these lines. We analyze resource consumption in any of the 88 non-complicating condition (CC)-stratified medical DRGs using the DRG prospective \"all payor system\" in effect at our hospital. Analysis of 12,340 medical patients by payor (Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, and commercial insurance) in these non-CC-stratified medical DRGs for a three-year period demonstrated that patients with more CCs per DRG for each payor generated higher total hospital costs, a longer hospital length of stay, a greater percentage of procedures per patient, higher financial risk under DRG payment, and a higher mortality, compared with patients in these same DRGs with fewer CCs. These findings suggest that new prospective DRG all payor systems may be inequitable to certain groups of patients or types of hospitals vis-a-vis the non-CC-stratified medical DRGs. Health policy leaders should be encouraged to stratify many medical DRGs by the numbers and types of CCs to more equitably reimburse hospitals under DRG all payor systems.\r"

The absence of four features, deep invasion, a prominent diffuse growth of glycogen-rich clear cells, significant nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity, argued against the diagnosis of clear-cell adenocarcinoma, which has a predilection to occur within urethral diverticula. Alertness to the possible presence of nephrogenic adenoma within a urethral diverticulum in a patient with predominantly gynecologic symptoms and knowledge of its morphologic variations is essential to prevent its misdiagnosis as clear-cell adenocarcinoma.\r"

To this end, we examined plasma samples from 21 patients who initially presented with a prolonged prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time or both for the presence of lupus anticoagulants. We used a battery of coagulation tests, including both immediate and two-hour mixing studies, a platelet neutralization procedure, a tissue thromboplastin inhibition test, and dilute Russell viper venom times. Two patients (10%) had only a prolonged prothrombin time, seven (33%) had only a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, and in 12 (57%) both were abnormal. In 15 patients, inhibition was evident on immediate assay of equal-volume mixture studies of patient plasma and normal pooled plasma, but in three additional patients it was evident only after a two-hour incubation. Fifteen of 18 samples showed correction of the abnormal screening study when platelets were used as a source of phospholipid. Both the tissue thromboplastin inhibition test and dilute Russell viper venom times were sensitive assays, being abnormal in 20 of 21 and 13 of 14 samples, respectively. In four patients, discordance of studies necessitated specific coagulation factor levels being measured to confirm the presence of the inhibitor. Because of the variable effect of the inhibitors on all currently available assay procedures, we would suggest that any evaluation will require a laboratory to have a battery of tests available before such an inhibitor can be excluded.\r"

The antioxidant supplements of ascorbic acid and alpha tocopherol resulted in a significant decrease in tumor formation when compared with control groups. In contrast, the beta carotene group showed no difference in tumor formation, and canthazanthin, a non-provitamin A carotenoid, resulted in an increase in tumor formation when compared with controls. In addition, the K-gel powder control diet (a carrier medium for alpha tocopherol acetate) had a significantly higher rate of tumor formation than the regular chow and placebo beadlet control diets.

This study evaluated the NK sensitivity of murine NRBs (C1300 and TBJ) in the regulation of NRB growth and determined the effects of recombinant (r) interferon gamma and recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2). Both basal (8% +/- 3% specific cytotoxicity) and induced (20% +/- 3%) NK lyses of C1300-NRB were observed. In vivo depletion of NK cells with anti-asialo GM-1 significantly enhanced growth of C1300-NRB and decreased survival. Treatment with r-interferon gamma or rIL-2 on days 1 through 3 after C1300-NRB inoculation significantly prolonged the mean tumor latency period, decreased the tumor growth rate, and enhanced in vitro NK killing of C1300-NRB and YAC-1. The effects of r-interferon gamma and IL-2 were abrogated by pretreatment with anti-asialo GM-1. These results demonstrated that NK cells form one important component of regulation of a murine NRB, but immunomodulation with potent lymphokines requires cooperation of more than one cell type.\r"

  ".W": "Infections, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed heart and heart-lung transplant recipients, frequently involve the central nervous system and can produce devastating neurologic sequelae. Between 1980 and 1987, a total of 363 heart transplant and 54 heart-lung transplant recipients at the University of Pittsburgh sustained 13 intracranial infections two to 143 weeks after transplantation. Computed tomography demonstrated well-defined Nocardia and Aspergillus abscesses in four patients. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal in all cases studied, including in those patients in whom culture confirmed meningitis. Computed tomography-guided stereotactic surgery was used to diagnose and aspirate two nocardial brain abscesses. The prognosis for patients with central nervous system infections was related to their overall condition at the time of diagnosis. Both patients with nocardial abscesses and one patient with Listeria leptomeningitis survived, but all ten other patients died because of extensive multisystem infectious complications.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that histamine receptors mediate increased blood-retinal barrier permeability in experimental diabetes, 51 rats were made diabetic by streptozocin injection (65 mg/kg; jugular vein) and were held for four weeks. The seven animal groups were as follows: untreated controls; untreated diabetic rats; diabetic rats receiving diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl); diabetic rats receiving cimetidine hydrochloride (Tagamet); diabetic rats receiving diphenhydramine and cimetidine; diabetic rats receiving purified pork insulin (Iletin II); and diabetic rats receiving insulin and diphenhydramine. All treatments were given during the last week. Blood-retinal barrier permeability was assessed through measurement of the vitreous content of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated to bovine serum albumin (FITCBSA) after 20 minutes of FITCBSA circulation. Vitreous FITCBSA content of the diabetic group was 64% greater than control content. Diabetic rats treated with either diphenhydramine or diphenhydramine and insulin had respective decreases of 43% and 40% in vitreous FITCBSA content. The vitreous content of the diabetic group receiving insulin was lowered 37% below untreated diabetic values, while the vitreous FITCBSA content of the diabetic group receiving both insulin and diphenhydramine was reduced 63%. These data indicate that retinal histamine H1-receptor activation may be partially responsible for initial blood-retinal barrier leakage of macromolecules into the vitreous and that this abnormal leakage can be prevented both by diphenhydramine and by insulin. Histamine H1 receptors may play an important role in mediating increased blood-retinal barrier permeability in experimental diabetes.\r"

Of 39 competencies, the faculty members judged that 33 should be included in medical school curricula. Those rated most important were competencies in the use of enteral and parenteral feeding techniques in patient therapy, the improvement of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and knowledge of the role of nutrition in the identification and management of selected disease states. There was significant agreement in ratings and curriculum placements by preclinical and clinical faculty members.\r"

To explore the idea that a higher cytosolic free Ca2+ (Cai2+) may be responsible for a blunted cGMP response to ANP, we examined the effect of raising Cai2+ by the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 or K+ depolarization on the ANP-induced cGMP response. Treatment of VSMCs from the SHR, Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), or American Wistar (WIS) rats with A23187 or high K+ resulted in a uniform reduction of the ANP-cGMP response in 1.8 mmol/L Ca2+ medium but not Ca2+-free medium. We conclude that a higher level of Cai2+, probably at the domain adjacent to the membrane, may inhibit ANP-induced activation of the particulate guanylate cyclase, and that this may be the cause of the blunted cGMP response of SHR VSMCs to ANP.\r"

Knowledge of optimal doses, duration of pain relief, and time between drug administration and pain relief is inadequate. Many studies indicate that the relief of pain is often incomplete after treatment with narcotic analgesics. There is often a need for alternative treatments. Large randomised studies consistently show that beta blockade, initially given intravenously and then orally, relieves pain and reduces the need for analgesics. Studies also indicate that early administration of streptokinase and glyceryl trinitrate relieves pain. There is evidence that drugs that limit ischaemic damage also relieve pain.\r"

Four children (body weight less than 5 kg) had congenital heart malformations and were studied during controlled mechanical ventilation, whereas the remainder (n = 34) who were healthy, breathed spontaneously. Anaesthesia was maintained with oxygen in air (FIO2 0.45) and halothane through a non-rebreathing circuit. Minute ventilation was measured by pneumotachography, E'CO2 with an in-line infra-red carbon dioxide meter and gas concentrations with a mass spectrometer. There were no differences in VO2 and VCO2 between children with and without heart disease. VO2 was related to body weight by the equation: VO2 = 5.0 x kg + 19.8 (r = 0.94) and VCO2 to body weight by the equation: VCO2 = 4.8 x kg + 6.4 (r = 0.94). There were no differences between VO2 or VCO2 before and after the start of surgery. In 11 of 21 patients weighing less than 10 kg, a reduced VCO2 was noted, giving respiratory quotients of less than 0.7. It is speculated that this age-dependent variation of VCO2 may result from partial inhibition of lipolysis in brown adipose tissue produced by halothane.\r"

In approximately 15% of persons with hemophilia, treatment with exogenous F.VIII is complicated by the development of anti-F.VIII antibodies which block F.VIII coagulant activity. These antibodies have been termed inhibitors. To localize epitopes recognized by inhibitors, we used a lambda gt11 library which expresses small random fragments of F.VIII as fusion proteins. One epitope has been mapped to the 25-amino acid sequence lys-338 through asp-362 of F.VIII (E338-362). Immunoaffinity-purified antibodies that react with this epitope neutralize F.VIII:C activity. E338-362 is adjacent to an enzymatic cleavage site at arg-372 which is important in F.VIII activation. Hence, an antibody binding to E338-362 would probably block this cleavage and thereby block activation of F.VIII.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-gamma, beta, and alpha genes has been analyzed in 29 patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by northern blotting analysis. In addition, the configuration of the TCR-alpha gene was examined using newly developed genomic J alpha probes capable of detecting TCR-alpha gene rearrangements involving joining (J)alpha regions up to 85 kilobase (kb) from constant (C)alpha. In this study, TCR-alpha gene rearrangements were detected in 16 of the 29 patients. Thus, the frequency of TCR-alpha gene rearrangements in B precursor ALL was as high as with TCR-gamma (15 of 29) and was higher than observed for TCR-beta (nine of 29). Truncated transcripts were frequently observed in cells with rearrangements of the TCR-beta or alpha gene. In contrast, TCR-gamma transcripts were detected in only one patient despite the high incidence of TCR-gamma gene rearrangements. Results presented here suggest that although expression of TCR genes was weak in B-precursor ALL cells compared with T-lineage cells, these genes experience both transcriptional and recombinational crossover in B-precursor ALL. The results also suggest that neither transcription nor gene rearrangement, when examined alone, are sufficient to assign T or B lymphocyte lineage in lymphoblastic leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Two distinct types of T-cell receptors (TCR), designated alpha beta and gamma delta, have been identified on the surface of T cells. In the adult, T cells bearing the gamma delta TCR are a minority and they have the phenotype CD3+, CD4-, CD8-/+. By using appropriate probes, rearrangements of the TCR alpha, beta, and gamma genes have been extensively investigated in a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders. Because the TCR delta gene has been cloned only recently, no comparable information exists with respect to this in human leukemias. We report the analysis of the TCR delta gene configuration in 21 T-cell acute and chronic leukemias, 40 B-cell leukemias, 4 acute myeloid leukemias of difficult classification, and 12 normal controls. The TCR delta genes were structurally modified in all T-cell disorders and in germ-line configuration in all controls and all but one case of non-T-cell leukemias tested. In one case of T-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CD3+, CD4-, CD8+) we found rearrangement and expression of TCR gamma and delta (but not alpha and beta), suggesting that leukemic transformation took place in a cell bearing a TCR gamma delta rather than a TCR alpha beta. In two cases of pre-T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, only delta was rearranged out of the three TCR genes tested. This finding is in keeping with the suggestion that the TCR delta gene might be the first to rearrange in T cell ontogeny, and that its mode of rearrangement may play a role in the subsequent choice of the cell between production of a TCR alpha beta or gamma delta. Thus, TCR delta chain gene analysis can provide novel information of the clonal nature of T-cell disorders, particularly if the analysis of the beta and gamma genes has not been helpful.\r"

Cholera toxin did not have an effect on the latter two assays. Pre-treatment of human neutrophils with pertussis toxin did not affect the binding of GM-CSF to its surface receptor.

  ".U": "89135012\r", 
  ".W": "Each of three individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed a pleomorphic malignant neoplasm in which a precise histopathologic diagnosis could not be rendered. In each case, the tumor cells expressed leukocyte common antigen and a variable constellation of antigens associated with B- and T-cell activation (HLA-DR, T9, T10, BL2, BL3, Ki-24, BLAST-2). They lacked all B cell, T cell, myeloid, and monocyte lineage-restricted antigens, resulting in their classification as hematopoietic neoplasms of uncertain lineage. However, antigen receptor gene rearrangement analysis demonstrated that each of these three neoplasms exhibited clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain and kappa light chain gene rearrangements and lacked T-cell receptor beta chain gene rearrangements and therefore were B cell-derived non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) representative of an equivalent, relatively mature stage of B-cell differentiation. In contrast with most AIDS-associated NHLs, each of these three neoplasms lacked c-myc gene rearrangements and contained Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins and/or sequences. These studies demonstrate that these three AIDS-associated neoplasms of uncertain lineage exhibit a strikingly similar constellation of distinctly uncommon morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic characteristics that distinguishes them substantially from the vast majority of NHLs that have been reported to occur in association with AIDS. The consistent presence of EBV proteins and/or DNA sequences suggests that the Epstein-Barr virus played a pathogenetic role in the development of these three AIDS-associated neoplasms. Finally, these studies further illustrate the utility of antigen receptor gene rearrangement analysis in the diagnosis and classification of hematopoietic neoplasms of uncertain lineage.\r"

All 3 were female children who had peripheral lymphadenopathy without organomegaly and underwent complete remission with or without chemotherapy. Their tumors were characterized histologically by predominant large cells, at times showing phagocytosis, and immunologically by peripheral T-cell phenotype and expression of Ki-1 antigen and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Since the same translocation has been reported in the literature in 4 patients with malignant histiocytosis (MH), and our patients had histologic features suggestive of that disease, it is likely that many tumors previously interpreted as MH are actually phagocytic large T-cell lymphoma carrying this translocation.\r"

The case notes for the last visit of 519 patients were analysed. The amount of diagnostic activity was similar for those who died and for the survivors. A higher proportion of women who died than of women who survived received treatment at the last follow up visit, and 2.6 times as many of those dying within one week of the last visit were given chemotherapy as were survivors with recurrent disease. Resources devoted to diagnostic investigations and treatment of cancer in terminally ill patients could be better used for care of the patients. This would be more likely to improve the patients' quality of life and conserve resources.\r"

The technique was used to detect human papillomavirus types 11 and 16 simultaneously in cellular DNA recovered from cervical smears in 38 women referred for colposcopy to evaluate cytological abnormality and 10 women with no history of cytological abnormality. The polymerase chain reaction was shown to be both specific and sensitive in detecting human papillomavirus DNA such that a single human papillomavirus molecule was detected in 10(5) cells. Of the 38 women with cytological abnormality, all were positive for human papillomavirus on testing with the polymerase chain reaction; 36 were infected with human papillomavirus type 16 and 22 dually infected with human papillomavirus types 11 and 16. Seven of the 10 women with no cytological abnormality were also infected with human papillomavirus type 11 or 16. The use of the polymerase chain reaction will facilitate epidemiological investigation of the aetiological role of human papillomavirus in cervical neoplasia. This preliminary analysis suggests that the prevalence of human papillomavirus infection is greater than previously reported.\r"

The prevalence of diabetes adjusted to 1987 demographic estimates was 11.2% in Asian men and 8.9% in Asian women whereas it was 2.8% in white men and 4.3% in white women. The excess of diabetes in Asian subjects was predominantly of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and no significant differences in body mass were found to account for the higher prevalence. Diabetes had not been diagnosed previously in at least 26% of the white and 30% of the Asian diabetics screened, and it is estimated that in this community the condition remains undiagnosed in 42% of white and 40% of Asian diabetics.\r"

Experimental investigations of the effects of night duty on young doctors are few and have given inconclusive results. To measure the effects of long hours of work and reduced sleep on cognitive performance and mood 20 house officers (14 men and six women; mean age 25, range 24-35) were examined for 35 minutes in one session towards the end of a normal working day and in a second session at the same time after working for up to 31 continuous hours with reduced sleep. The order of the sessions was counterbalanced across the subjects. Each session comprised a series of cognitive tests: choice reaction time, vigilance reaction time, and haptic sorting tests and completion of a profile of mood states and a general questionnaire. After night duty there was a significant slowing in cognitive processing together with a decline in reaction times in the vigilance test. Loss of sleep contributed only to increased variability in the choice reaction time. Significant deleterious changes in mood after night duty occurred in all the mood scales after night duty. Continuous working may adversely affect the cognitive function and mood to the detriment of the welfare of doctors and their patients.\r"

On the basis that the aetiology of the sudden infant death syndrome may lie in an unusual response to a trivial intercurrent respiratory infection a necropsy study was carried out investigating pulmonary immunoglobulins in 16 victims of the syndrome and a series of infants (controls) who had died of non-pulmonary causes. Compared with the controls victims of the sudden infant death syndrome had grossly raised concentrations of IgG, IgM, and to a less extent IgA in lung lavage samples. In addition, pulmonary interstitial and terminal airway cells expressing these immunoglobulins were identified far more often in victims than controls. The study failed to determine whether the increased immunoglobulin concentrations were a consequence of an unusual response to a trivial infection or an expression of otherwise altered immunological control in the respiratory tract. Epidemiological evidence and the findings of this study suggest that the respiratory tract is the prime target organ in the sudden infant death syndrome.\r"

There was considerable overlap between symptoms of heartburn and upper abdominal pain, with over half of patients with dyspepsia experiencing both. One in four of these patients had consulted their general practitioner during that time. The proportion of patients with dyspepsia who consulted their general practitioner varied widely among the eight doctors who participated in the study, from 17% to 45%. Frequency of symptoms tended to fall with age, particularly in men, while the proportion of patients with dyspepsia who sought medical advice increased with age. Almost one in five of the 2066 patients had been investigated with radiology or endoscopy at some time, and 143 (7%) of them claimed to have had a diagnosis of peptic ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "The numbers of patients being admitted to hospital with aortic aneurysms have increased recently. A study was carried out to try to find out whether this was a true increase in incidence or whether it could be attributable to more accurate diagnosis and better surgical techniques. From analyses of routine statistics it was found that from 1950 to 1984 age standardised mortality rose 20-fold in men to 47.1 per 100,000 population and 11-fold in women to 22.2 per 100,000 and that this was mainly due to more deaths from abdominal aneurysms. Hospital admissions of men with abdominal aneurysms were found to have increased steadily from 1968 to 1983, but the increase for women admitted did not begin until 1978. An increase in both emergency and elective admissions and only a marginal fall in deaths in hospital (from 45% to 39%) suggest that admissions for abdominal aneurysms increased across a wide range of severity of disease. It is concluded for the following reasons that the true incidence of aortic aneurysms, particularly abdominal aneurysms, has been increasing in England and Wales: the trends are not wholly compatible with advances in diagnosis and surgery, there are inconsistencies by age and sex, and increases have occurred in the number of complicated as well as uncomplicated cases.\r"

Eight patients proved to have vascular graft infection and indium uptake was seen along the length of the graft in six. Two patients with open wound infections and synthetic grafts had localized uptake only on leucocyte scanning. Four patients, all of whom had negative scans were not thought to have infected grafts after further investigation using digital subtraction angiography and computed tomography scanning. These patients have been followed up for a median period of 19 months (range 5-25 months) and have remained symptom free. Initial experience with 111In-labelled leucocyte scanning has been encouraging, both in diagnosis and in planning the management of patients with graft infections.\r"

Cancer registry data on 1,774 patients from 63 hospitals were used to investigate whether the preoperative level of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was a prognostic indicator of survival for cancers diagnosed between 1976 and 1978. A direct relationship was found between the preoperative level of serum CEA and both the thickness and stage of the tumor at initial diagnosis. For Stage B2/3 colorectal cancer, the actuarial survival curves corresponding to normal, elevated, and markedly elevated CEA levels were significantly different (p less than 0.0001). The five-year survival rates for these patients were 61, 50, and 32 percent, respectively. Similar trends for patients with Stage C2/3 cancer were observed (p = 0.0058). The corresponding five-year survival rates were 44, 30, and 26 percent, respectively. Using a statewide cancer registry system, the analysis suggested that the preoperative level of serum CEA was an indicator of survival in patients with colorectal cancer, independent of the stage of disease at diagnosis.\r"

The grade of regression was classified according to a four-stage scale. Tumor regression was elevated as good (Grades 1, 2) and bad (3, 4) response to combined preoperative therapy. After a follow-up of 18 to 30 months, 14 of 41 patients have experienced a locoregional recurrence; all these patients were bad responders (Grades 3, 4) to preoperative radiochemotherapy. There was a statistically significant correlation between tumor regression grade and probability of survival (P less than 0.001). The authors conclude that the prognosis of patients with pretreated SCC of head and neck depends on the histologic grade of tumor regression.\r"

  ".W": "Discontinuous density sucrose gradient centrifugation was used to isolate membrane vesicles from the left ventricle of three normal subjects (one prospective organ donor and two traffic victims whose hearts were obtained 1 hour after death) and nine patients undergoing cardiac transplantation as a consequence of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Sarcolemma-enriched subcellular fractions, detected in the interface between 8.55% and 25% sucrose, were identified by the increased activity of Na+,K+-ATPase and by enrichment in beta-adrenergic receptor density. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors was lower in vesicles from diseased hearts (610 +/- 71 fmol/mg protein) than in vesicles from normal hearts (1,410 +/- 226 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.01). alpha 1-Adrenergic receptors were identified in these membrane vesicles by [3H]prazosin binding. Specific binding of [3H]prazosin was about 50% of the total binding at 1 nM, and alpha 1-adrenergic binding sites were saturable at approximately 3 nM. Scatchard analysis revealed 58 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein (KD = 0.90 +/- 0.08 nM) in pathological hearts and 30 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein (KD = 0.90 +/- 0.03 nM) in normal hearts (p less than 0.01). The displacement curve of (-)-norepinephrine in membrane vesicles from normal hearts delineated one subpopulation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors; the addition of 0.1 mM GTP did not cause right shift. In membrane vesicles from diseased heart, the displacement curve of (-)-norepinephrine disclosed two subpopulations of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. A right shift that occurred after addition of GTP showed that in this case alpha 1-adrenergic receptors were functionally coupled with GTP-binding protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of the stimulation of autonomic nervous system, hemodynamic factors, and humoral factors (epinephrine, angiotensin, vasopressin, and brain extracts) on the release of ANP under basal conditions and during increased atrial pressure produced by acute volume loading in pithed rats were examined. In conscious rats, acute volume expansion by 0.9% of saline (4 ml) increased the plasma immunoreactive ANP (IR-ANP) concentrations by a factor of 4 (140 +/- 30 pg/ml vs. 521 +/- 140 pg/ml, p less than 0.001, n = 8), whereas volume-induced ANP release was blocked in pithed rats (75 +/- 9 pg/ml vs. 99 +/- 13 pg/ml, NS, n = 7). The ANP versus right atrial pressure curve shifted to the right, indicating that much smaller amounts of IR-ANP were released in pithed than in conscious rats for each given increase in right atrial pressure. Electrical vagal and sympathetic nerve stimulation or changes in heart rate had no effect on plasma IR-ANP concentrations and failed to restore the volume-load-induced release of ANP in pithed rats. When extracts of anterior pituitary lobe, brain cortex, or hypothalamus were infused, no effect on volume-expansion-induced plasma IR-ANP levels was seen. In contrast, acute volume expansion caused a fourfold increase in levels of circulating IR-ANP in pithed rats that received posterior pituitary extracts, and the ANP versus right atrial pressure curve shifted markedly to the left. Infusion of a V1 antagonist blocked the volume-expansion-induced ANP release produced by the posterior pituitary extract. When [Arg8]-vasopressin (0.025 or 0.05 micrograms/kg/min) was infused to pithed rats, mean arterial pressure increased but basal plasma IR-ANP did not change significantly. However, acute volume expansion in the presence of vasopressin infusion (0.05 micrograms/kg/min) increased the amount of circulating IR-ANP by a factor of 4 (113 +/- 14 pg/ml vs. 414 +/- 43 pg/ml, p less than 0.001, n = 8). Thus, for a given increase in right atrial pressure, a similar amount of IR-ANP was released in the pithed rat during the vasopressin infusion as in the normal conscious animal. V1 antagonist blocked the increase in mean aterial pressure as well as the increase of plasma IR-ANP produced by [Arg8]-vasopressin. In addition, volume expansion during intravenous epinephrine (1.75 micrograms/kg/min) and angiotensin (1.0 micrograms/kg/min) doubled plasma IR-ANP levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ten-second coronary occlusion without subsequent flow restriction resulted in marked reactive hyperemic responses (Doppler flow probes), mean flow debt repayment was 481 +/- 55%. When the 10-second coronary occlusions were followed by a 20-second partial restriction that allowed normal preocclusion coronary inflow, the subsequent reactive hyperemia was significantly augmented, mean flow debt repayment was 938 +/- 91% (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with ANP (3 micrograms/kg) did not alter the flow debt repayment after a 10-second occlusion without restriction (474 +/- 30%, NS) but attenuated the augmentation of reactive hyperemia resulting from the 20-second inflow restriction, flow debt repayment (613 +/- 66%, NS). Regional myocardial blood flow to the ischemic region was measured during restricted inflow after a 10-second coronary occlusion before and after ANP pretreatment. Before ANP, subendocardial flow decreased (0.54 +/- 0.04 ml/min/g) and subepicardial flow significantly increased (1.03 +/- 0.12 ml/min/g) when compared with the nonischemic zone (subendocardial, 1.03 +/- 0.09 ml/min/g; subepicardial, 0.87 +/- 0.09 ml/min/g, p less than 0.05), indicating maldistribution of the restricted inflow.

  ".W": "A reduced coronary flow reserve has been reported in patients with ischemialike symptoms and normal coronary arteries. In 13 such patients, both coronary vasomotion and flow reserve were studied. The luminal area of the proximal and distal third of the left anterior descending and left circumflex artery were determined by biplane quantitative coronary arteriography using a computer-assisted system. Patients were studied at rest, during submaximal supine bicycle exercise (4.0 minutes, 116 W), and 5 minutes after sublingual administration of 1.6 mg nitroglycerin. Heart rate, mean pulmonary pressure, and mean aortic pressure as well as the percent change of both proximal and distal luminal area were determined. In 10 of the 13 patients, coronary sinus blood flow was measured by coronary sinus thermodilution technique at rest and after dipyridamole infusion (0.5 mg/kg in 15 minutes) 10 +/- 5 days after quantitative coronary arteriography. Coronary flow ratio (dipyridamole/rest) and coronary resistance ratio (rest/dipyridamole) were determined in these patients. Patients were divided into two groups according to the behavior of the coronary vessels during exercise (vasodilation, group 1; vasoconstriction, group 2). Coronary vasodilation of the proximal (luminal area +26%, p less than 0.001) and distal (+45%, p less than 0.001) artery was observed in seven patients (group 1) during exercise and after sublingual nitroglycerin (+46%, p less than 0.001; and +99%, p less than 0.001, respectively). In group 2 (n = 6), however, there was coronary vasoconstriction of the distal vessel segments (-24%, p less than 0.001) during exercise, whereas the proximal coronary artery showed vasodilation (+26%, p less than 0.001) during exercise. After sublingual nitroglycerin, both vessel segments elicited vasodilation (distal coronary, +44%, p less than 0.001; proximal coronary artery, +47%, p less than 0.001). Coronary flow ratio amounted to 2.5 in group 1 and 1.2 in group 2 (p less than 0.05) and coronary resistance ratio to 2.7 in group 1 and to 1.2 in group 2 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Thus, among patients with ischemialike symptoms and normal coronary arteries, there is a group of patients (group 2) with an abnormal dilator response of the distal coronary arteries to the physiologic dilator stimulus of exercise and a reduced dilator capacity of the resistance vessels after dipyridamole (abnormal coronary vasodilator syndrome). The nature of this exercise-induced distal coronary vasoconstriction is not clear but might be due to an abnormal neurohumoral tone that may cause or contribute to the blunted vascular response during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS), patients early (6-60 days) after acute myocardial infarction (MI) with ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) of over 10 per hour were randomized to receive, unaware, therapy with one of four antiarrhythmic drugs (n = 402) or placebo (n = 100). Treatment success was defined as 70% or more decrease in VPC rate and 90% or more decrease in VPC runs. If the first active drug was ineffective, a second drug was given. If placebo was ineffective, a second placebo was given. To determine whether or not baseline clinical characteristics predict the response to antiarrhythmic therapy, 10 baseline variables were selected for investigation: age, prior MI, time from CAPS MI to randomization, ejection fraction, baseline VPC frequency, presence of runs (greater than or equal to 3 consecutive VPCs, greater than or equal to 100 beats/min), beta-blocker therapy, digitalis therapy, MI transmurality, and MI location. At the end of the first drug treatment, apparent treatment success in patients receiving placebo was associated on univariate analysis with absence of prior MI, with trends for younger age and Q wave MI, whereas in patients receiving active therapies, higher ejection fraction and younger age were associated with better suppression. In the encainide and flecainide treatments, where the greatest response was observed, absence of prior MI, higher ejection fraction, and younger age were associated with more successful treatment. In a multivariate analysis with these variables, ejection fraction and age remained significant for all active therapies, absence of prior MI and ejection fraction remained significant in the encainide and flecainide treatments, and absence of prior MI in the placebo treatment. Few variables except ejection fraction were associated with VPC suppression during the 1-year follow-up, and only lower ejection fraction and older age related to loss of long-term suppression. Thus, there are only a few independent baseline clinical variables (notably, ejection fraction) that substantially affect antiarrhythmic drug efficacy in suppressing VPCs in patients early after MI. Some variables, however, may be associated with spontaneous arrhythmia variability, leading to an apparent (placebo) response. These findings will be helpful in designing and interpreting treatment studies in patients after MI.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the relation between synthesis, atrial storage, and plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and it examined plasma ANP levels and hemodynamic output in response to volume expansion in a rat model of myocardial infarction and failure. Arterial ANP concentrations did not correlate linearly with infarct size, but they did show an abrupt increase when infarct size exceeded 30% of the left ventricle, similar to the abrupt increase of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure with infarct size greater than 30%. Consequently, a close relation was found between plasma ANP levels and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (n = 23, r = 0.89, p less than 0.001). Atrial ANP content per gram of tissue but not ANP content per pair of atria was reduced in rats with large infarcts (greater than 40%, p less than 0.05 vs. control animals). ANP mRNA level per pair of atria (related to total atrial RNA), determined by liquid hybridization (controlled by northern blot analysis), was increased by 38% in infarcted rats (p less than 0.05 vs. controls), but the ratio of atrial ANP mRNA relative to atrial beta-actin mRNA levels was not increased. Right and left ventricular ANP mRNA level increased by 90% and 380%, respectively, far exceeding the concomitant increase in beta-actin mRNA (+26% in the left ventricle). Plasma ANP increased with volume loading in controls and rats with moderate infarcts but not in rats with large infarcts despite a similar increase in right atrial pressure (compared with control animals); thus, the relation of delta ANP/delta right atrial pressure exerted by volume loading decreased in rats with large infarcts. Similarly, the response of cardiac output and renal blood flow (determined by radioactive microspheres) to volume loading was attenuated in rats with large infarcts. Thus, in this model of chronic cardiac failure, the activation of the ANP system is closely coupled with the increase in intracardiac pressures without correlating linearly to the extent of myocardial loss. Second, in severe cardiac failure, additional stimulation such as volume loading may elicit only an attenuated ANP secretion response, for example, due to saturation of the ANP receptor sensing system or to a limited transformation rate of pro-ANP. Third, the increase in atrial ANP synthesis and the increase in atrial ANP gene expression seems limited; however, substantial specific ANP gene expression occurs in the ventricles, which, in turn, may contribute to increased plasma ANP levels in chronic heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "After addition of a low concentration of thrombin to normal plasma, a progressive and significant increase in crosslinked fibrin polymers was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate agarose gel electrophoresis, reaching 27% of total fibrinogen and fibrin before gel formation. As measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody specific for an epitope near the gamma gamma crosslink site, increased immunoreactivity of plasma did not occur after adding thrombin despite formation of crosslinked fibrin polymers, which indicates that the antibody does not recognize the epitope in the polymers. Addition of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) to plasma resulted in a more rapid degradation of fibrin polymers than of fibrinogen, indicating that the fibrin specificity of t-PA is retained with soluble fibrin. Coincident with degradation of plasma crosslinked fibrin polymers, plasma DD immunoreactivity increased 70-fold from 50.3 +/- 4.5 (mean +/- SD) to 3,560 +/- 1,235 ng/ml. The presence of increased crosslinked fibrin polymers produced by adding thrombin to plasma significantly increased maximum immunoreactivity after t-PA-induced degradation to 18,500 +/- 11,780 ng/ml. The increase in DD immunoreactivity was dependent on t-PA concentration; no elevation occurred below 0.01 micrograms/ml, and maximal increases occurred above 100 micrograms/ml. Analysis of gel electrophoretic patterns of thrombin and t-PA-treated plasma samples suggests that the DD reactivity of t-PA-treated plasma is mainly due to degradation of soluble crosslinked fibrin polymers. Our findings indicate that plasmic degradation of soluble fibrin polymers in plasma may be an important source of fragment DD during thrombolytic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We postulated that an increase in the biological effectiveness of somatostatin (SRIF) accounts, at least in part, for the decrease in basal and GRF-induced ovine GH (oGH) secretion observed around birth in the ovine fetus and neonate. To test this hypothesis, SRIF (SRIF-14; given as 30 micrograms/kg iv bolus, followed by 2 micrograms/kg.min for 75 min) was infused into chronically catheterized fetal and neonatal lambs, and the oGH response induced by GRF [GRF-(1-44) amide; 1 microgram/kg] in the presence of exogenous SRIF was compared to the oGH response induced by GRF in saline-infused controls. In fetuses of 115-122 days gestation, SRIF had no detectable effect on the oGH response to GRF [peak incremental oGH response (mean +/- SEM), 527 +/- 124 vs. 562 +/- 103 ng/ml in controls]. In neonatal lambs (3-17 days old), SRIF completely suppressed the immediate oGH response to GRF (peak incremental response, 0.8 +/- 1.3 vs. 111 +/- 34 ng/ml in controls; P less than 0.02). In late gestational fetuses (126-139 days old), a transitional pattern was observed (peak incremental oGH response, 207 +/- 56 vs. 324 +/- 30 ng/ml in controls; P less than 0.04). In the second part of this study, we explored, in the neonatal lamb, the hypothesis that SRIF withdrawal plays a role in pulsatile GH secretion and that the amount of GRF to which the somatotrope is exposed before SRIF withdrawal is a major factor in determining the amplitude of GH bursts. SRIF (SRIF-14; a 30 micrograms/kg bolus, followed by 2 micrograms/kg.min) was infused iv for 40 min, GRF [GRF-(1-44) amide; 1 microgram/kg] was injected iv 20 min after starting the SRIF infusion, and the oGH rise after SRIF withdrawal was evaluated. In one series of controls GRF was replaced by saline, and in the other SRIF was replaced by saline. The oGH rise during recovery after SRIF alone was lower than that after the combined administration of SRIF and GRF (peak oGH increment, 8 +/- 3 vs. 38 +/- 12 ng/ml; P less than 0.04). The amplitude of the GH pulse after SRIF and GRF was similar to the immediate oGH response to GRF alone. These studies show that SRIF is unable to suppress the immediate oGH response to GRF in the ovine fetus, and that the suppressive effect of SRIF on the immediate oGH response to GRF increases gradually in late gestation and sharply at birth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89136882\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of this study was to establish the mechanism by which adrenalectomy promotes the antilipolytic effect of the adenosine analog (-)-N6-(R-phenyl-isopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA) in rat fat cells. This action of adrenalectomy was not specific for R-PIA, since it was also observed with nicotinic acid and was prevented by phosphodiesterase inhibitors. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of R-PIA and nicotinic acid toward isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was unaltered by adrenalectomy regardless of whether phosphodiesterase inhibitors were present. Whatever the conditions used, however, the cAMP levels in adrenalectomized rat adipocytes were one quarter to one third of those in sham-operated rats and remained below the limit over which variations in cAMP had no more influence in lipolysis. Both total and particulate low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase activities per adipocyte were decreased in adrenalectomized rats, but the stimulatory responses of the particulate enzyme to R-PIA remained unchanged. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation studies revealed a marked decrease in the total amount of the alpha-subunits of Go and the adenylate cyclase inhibitory regulatory protein Gi after adrenalectomy. However, the inhibitory dose-response curves of adenylate cyclase to R-PIA, nicotinic acid, GTP, guanylylimidodiphosphate, and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) were unaltered by adrenalectomy, indicating that the inhibitory function of Gi is unimpaired by adrenalectomy. Lastly, adrenalectomy resulted in a 60% reduction of the Mn2+-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity/adipocyte, which indicates that adrenalectomy causes a defect in adenylate cyclase catalytic activity. Thus, enhanced antilipolytic effects of R-PIA induced by adrenalectomy do not involve increased function of the adenosine receptor Gi-coupled adenylate cyclase inhibitory pathway, but are related to abnormally low intracellular cAMP levels due to defective adenylate cyclase catalytic activity.\r"

  ".U": "89136885\r", 
  ".W": "We previously reported that systemic administration of the recently described GRF peptide antagonist (N-Ac-Tyr1,D-Arg2)GRF-(1-29)-NH2 to adult male rats would suppress the pulsatile release of GH. In the present study, we have sought to determine whether this same antagonist would be efficacious in immature male rats to block spontaneous GH secretion and, as a result, retard several parameters of somatic growth. Indwelling Silastic catheters were placed into the jugular veins of immature male rats (120-140 g) at 29 days of age. After a recovery period of 48 h, beginning at 1000 h, 100-400 micrograms/kg GRF antagonist or its vehicle (controls) were injected iv immediately after withdrawing an initial blood sample from conscious undisturbed animals. Subsequent samples were obtained every 20 min until 1520 h. Red blood cells were resuspended in a restorative volume of saline and reinjected after each blood sample. Results showed that both doses of antagonist prevented the two major periods of episodic GH release observed in controls. For example, mean plasma GH (+/- SEM; nanograms per ml) at 1120 h was 9.0 +/- 2.7 in antagonist-treated rats and 37.1 +/- 5.1 in controls (P less than 0.05). Mean plasma GH (+/- SEM) at 1340 h was 10.8 +/- 3.7 in antagonist-treated rats and 38.8 +/- 9.6 in controls (P less than 0.05). Injection of 400 micrograms/kg of the structurally related VIP antagonist (N-Ac-Tyr1,D-Phe2)GRF-(1-29)-NH2, iv failed to suppress spontaneous GH release. GRF antagonist (100 micrograms/kg) was next administered twice daily iv for 4 days to 31-day-old rats in metabolic cages. This treatment essentially arrested the normal rapid body weight gain, significantly suppressed increases in body and tail lengths, and reduced increases in heart and kidney weights (P less than 0.01). Food intake and fecal output were unchanged by antagonist treatment and, therefore, did not contribute to the observed effects. These results support the idea that a number of tissues and organs are stimulated by the pulsatile secretion of GH and that a peptidic GRF receptor antagonist is useful in blocking episodic GH release in immature animals. As a consequence, this specific antagonist is effective in suppressing numerous aspects of somatic growth.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known regarding how the guinea pig (GP) compares with the rat in terms of TSH economy. To develop a heterologous RIA for GP TSH, rabbits were injected with GP TSH. In one rabbit (anti-gpTSH-8), antibodies that bound 125I-labeled bovine (b) TSH and rat (r) TSH but not 125I-labeled bLH or rPRL were generated. The binding of anti-gpTSH-8 to [125I]bTSH was inhibited in a parallel manner by bTSH over a range of 0.047-5.42 ng, rTSH over a range of 0.24-25 ng, and dilutions of GP pituitary extracts. This system, with bTSH as the standard, was employed as the basis for a heterologous TSH RIA (GP TSH RIA). The cross-reactions of rTSH and bLH in the GP TSH RIA were 45% and 7%, respectively. Rat and bovine FSH, GH, and PRL had little or no cross-reaction. GP pituitaries were incubated in vitro and dosed with LHRH and TRH. The GP TSH RIA detected an 11-fold increase in TSH in the medium in response to TRH and no change in immunoreactivity in response to LHRH. In contrast, a RIA for bLH detected a 25-fold increase in LH in the medium in response to LHRH and no increase in response to TRH. The TSH content in GP pituitaries was significantly lower than that in the rat (GP, 16.8 +/- 1.6 ng/mg; rat, 80.3 +/- 6.2 ng/mg; P less than 0.05) as were serum TSH concentrations (GP, 0.8 +/- 0.4 ng/ml; rat, 4.5 +/- 1.1 ng/ml; P less than 0.05). Thyroid hormone administration (T4 Rx) in both GP and rat produced a significant reduction in pituitary TSH content (GP control, 4.8 +/- 0.4 ng/mg; T4 Rx, 2.1 ng/mg; P less than 0.05; rat control, 52.4 +/- 4.0 ng/mg; T4 Rx, 20.5 +/- 1.6 ng/mg; P less than 0.05) and TSH release (GP control, 9.4 +/- 2.3 ng/ml; T4 Rx, 4.3 +/- 1.5 ng/ml; P less than 0.05; rat control, 357 +/- 81 ng/ml; T4 Rx, 133 +/- 27 ng/ml; P less than 0.05) from incubated hemipituitaries. Thyroidectomy in the rat was associated with a decrease in pituitary TSH content, but no change in pituitary content was found in thyroidectomized GPs. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of estimating GP TSH with a heterologous RIA that employs polyvalent antiserum against GP TSH as the first antibody and bTSH as the tracer and standard.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We attempted to determine if granulosa cells from different maturational states had different responses to these agonists and antagonists. Cells were cultured in serum-free medium 199 supplemented with insulin (10 micrograms/ml), transferrin ( 5 micrograms/ml), and androstenedione (2.5 X 10(-7) M) for 48 h. Levels of progesterone (P) and estradiol (E2) were determined in spent medium by RIA. We found that FSH, forskolin, and cAMP all stimulated secretion of E2 and P in a dose-dependent manner in both developmental groups. When TPA was added alone to cultures, P levels were stimulated at low doses of TPA but inhibited at higher doses in granulosa from both sized follicles, whereas cells from both small- and medium-sized follicles demonstrated reductions in E2. TPA was also found to inhibit FSH-, forskolin-, and cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in cells from the two groups of follicles. The stimulatory effects of any of the secretagogues on E2 secretion were inhibited by TPA to a significantly greater extent in granulosa cells from small follicles. Although inhibition of FSH- and forskolin-induced P secretion by TPA was also greater in granulosa cells from small follicles, cAMP-treated cells did not show this differential inhibition. Thus, it appears that modulators of the protein kinase-C system regulate steroidogenesis differently in granulosa cells from small and medium follicles. These differences may involve alterations in the interplay between the protein kinase-C and cAMP pathways.\r"

Experimental rats received PDS-TE implants for an initial 8-week period; control rats received empty implants. By 8 weeks of PDS-TE treatment, rats became severely oligospermic, and the T concentration within the seminiferous tubule fluid (STF) was reduced approximately 80% (from 57.8 ng/ml in controls to 9.6 ng/ml). After the initial 8-week PDS-TE treatment, PDS-TE implants were removed from one group of rats; a second group of PDS-TE-implanted rats received an additional PDS-T implant of 24 cm. Eight weeks after the removal of PDS-TE implants or the implantation of additional T, testis weight and numbers of advanced spermatogenic cells were restored to those of control rats. The STF T concentration 8 weeks after the removal of PDS-TE implants also was restored to that in control rats. In contrast, the STF T concentration increased to only 40% of control values in the rats that received an additional T implant. Despite this 60% reduction in T concentration compared to the control value, advanced spermatogenic cell number was restored to a value indistinguishable from that of intact controls. These observations indicate that spermatogenesis can be quantitatively restored in PDS-TE-implanted rats with exogenously administered T, and moreover, that this restoration does not require the high T concentration found in the STF of intact control rats.\r"

To further elucidate the mechanism of this inhibitory action of the antibody, the involvement of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins was studied using islet cell-activating protein (IAP) and cholera toxin. When FRTL-5 cells were pretreated with IAP and incubated with the antibody, the inhibitory activity of the antibody on cAMP production was completely abolished. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of the antibody on TSH- or forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was also abolished by IAP preincubation. The inhibitory activity of the antibody by pretreatment of the cells was also reversed by the addition of IAP. Coincubation of FRTL-5 cells with the antibody and cholera toxin reduced the cAMP inhibitory action of the antibody. Similar results were obtained with anti-fGM1 pretreatment before cholera toxin stimulation. These results provide evidence that anti-fGM1 antibody acts via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins in inhibiting cAMP production in FRTL-5 cells.\r"

Immunization resulted in the formation of CRF antibodies, as indicated by binding of [125I]iodo-rCRF and attenuation of the plasma corticosterone responses to ether stress. Rat spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma P3 cells, and a hybridoma clone (PFU 83) was selected according to its capacity to bind [125I]iodo-rCRF and inhibit rCRF-induced ACTH release from cultured rat pituitary cells. PFU 83 antibodies (IgG2a subclass) are directed to the extreme C-terminal part (amino acids 38-39) of rCRF and bind with an affinity constant of 21 nM. In vitro, PFU 83 causes a parallel shift to the right of the rCRF dose-ACTH response curve, with an apparent affinity of 10 nM. PFU 83 neither binds nor blocks the ACTH-releasing activity of oCRF. Intravenous administration of PFU 83 ascites (generated in nude mice) to Wistar rats caused a dose-dependent inhibition of ether-induced ACTH secretion. Full blockade of the ACTH response to ether was found at a dose of 10 nmol PFU 83/rat. Based on the dynamics of rCRF binding and its in vitro and in vivo effects, we conclude that the rCRF-blocking bioactivity of PFU 83 is due to binding of PFU 83 to native rCRF and formation of a biologically inactive complex. Finally, we found that PFU 83 did not affect resting or ether-induced alpha MSH secretion, indicating that CRF does not play a major role in the control of alpha MSH secretion.\r"

This 68.4K high density lipoprotein (HDL) corresponds to the minor approximately 67K HDL subfraction that we recently demonstrated as binding most of the HDL-associated T4. Since we have recently found that lipids inhibit the binding of T4 to apolipoprotein A-I, the very low lipid content (16 mol/mol) of this 68K HDL relative to that (greater than 100 mol/mol) of high mol wt HDL subfractions may account for the preferential binding of T4 to the low mol wt subfraction.\r"

In the females, age-related decrease in the serum TSH concentration was not observed, but decreases in serum T3 (2.1-1.4 ng/ml) and T4 (59-48 ng/ml) were observed. However, the serum T4 level of the oldest group (19 yr old) significantly increased as compared with the 11-yr-old group (56 ng/ml). In the males, age-related decreases in the serum TSH, T3, and T4 were observed. Furthermore, significant increases in serum TSH concentrations after injection of TRH were detected. The oldest group (16 yr old) showed the highest response among the five different age groups tested. However, the highest responses of T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland after TRH injection were obtained by the 10-yr-old group. The results suggest that the sensitivity of the thyroid gland to TSH and/or the productive or releasing capacities of T3 and T4 in the thyroid gland decreased with increasing age in this primate species.\r"

  ".U": "89136907\r", 
  ".W": "In the male rhesus monkey, the negative feedback regulation of gonadotropin secretion by the gonad involves a specific inhibitory action of a testicular hormone on FSH release at the level of the anterior pituitary gland. Neither circulating testosterone (T) nor estradiol appears to be able to account for the testicular inhibition of FSH in this species. The purpose of the present study was to begin to examine the role of gonadal peptides in this regard. To this end, an episodic pattern of activity in the pituitary-Leydig cell axis was restored in seven hypothalamus-lesioned male rhesus monkeys with a chronic and unchanging intermittent iv infusion of GnRH (0.1 microgram/min for 3 min every 3 h). This preparation, known as the hypophysiotropic clamp, has been described in detail previously. Charcoal-extracted porcine follicular fluid (pFF) was used as the source of gonadal peptides. In five animals, initiation of combined T replacement and pFF treatment (10-15 ml, sc, every 12 h for 8 days) maintained circulating FSH at concentrations similar to those observed before gonadectomy. Withdrawal of pFF treatment for 8 days while maintaining T replacement resulted in a progressive and dramatic rise in plasma FSH concentrations. Reinitiation of pFF treatment resulted in a return of circulating FSH concentrations toward precastration control values. Changes in LH secretion throughout the experiment were unremarkable. In an attempt to assess any nonspecific effects of porcine protein on gonadotropin secretion, the remaining two animals received charcoal-extracted pig serum instead of pFF. In these animals circulating FSH concentrations rose 7- to 8-fold during the 8 days of combined T replacement and pig serum treatment. These findings provide evidence to support the view that a testicular peptide, most probably inhibin, plays a major role in the negative feedback regulation of gonadotropin secretion in the monkey by exerting an inhibitory action on FSH secretion directly at the level of the anterior pituitary gland.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined whether granulosa cells (GC) secrete transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta)-like activity using cell cultures prepared from diethylstilbestrol-primed female rats. Our results indicate that a significant level of active as well as latent TGF beta activity is found in defined GC culture medium as assessed by 1) potentiation of FSH-induced differentiation of rat GC, 2) neutralization of its activity by anti-TGF beta immunoglobulin, 3) inhibition of DNA synthesis in mink lung epithelial cells (CCl 64), and 4) activation of latent TGF beta activity by either acid or heat treatment. TGF beta production was more pronounced when the cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated plates. There was no difference in the level of TGF beta secretion by GC preparations derived from either diethylstilbestrol-primed immature or normal immature rats or adult rats. Furthermore, rat GC-conditioned medium contained much more TGF beta activity than medium from normal rat kidney cells (NRK 49-F), human prostatic adenocarcinoma cells (PC-3), or porcine GC. Rat thecal/interstitial cell culture medium contained activity comparable to that of GC medium. We conclude that rat GC preparations secrete a high level of TGF beta activity in vitro. Taken together with previous results, this indicates the possibility that TGF beta may be an autocrine regulator as well as a paracrine one within the ovarian follicle. Moreover, because of the high level of TGF beta activity produced, the rat GC culture system appears to be a useful experimental model for further exploring relationships between TGF beta production and its action.\r"

  ".W": "Pituitary gonadotropin responses to GnRH were measured using both in vitro and in vivo methods to investigate the contribution of increased pituitary responsiveness to GnRH in generating the rise in serum gonadotropin levels after gonadectomy. We compared in vitro GnRH-stimulated secretion rates of LH and FSH of perifused pituitaries obtained from intact female (metestrous) and male rats, and rats gonadectomized 2 or 6 days earlier. GnRH pulses (peak amplitude, 50, 500, or 5000 ng/ml; frequency, one per h) caused significant dose-dependent increases in gonadotropin secretion rates. However, gonadectomy resulted in decreased secretion rates of LH and FSH. Similar findings were observed for in vivo serum gonadotropin responses to a single iv injection of GnRH (males received 250 or 1000 ng; females received 1000 or 4000 ng). These results indicate that increases in serum LH and FSH levels 2 or 6 days after gonadectomy are not mediated by increased responses of the rat anterior pituitary to GnRH. We have also shown that perifused pituitaries from proestrous and diestrous rats exhibit significantly higher GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion rates than pituitaries from metestrous and estrous rats. Therefore, we tested the effect of in vivo pretreatment with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) or testosterone (T) in both female and male rats on the in vitro secretion of LH and FSH. Rats were gonadectomized and received a sc Silastic implant containing E2, T, or no steroid as a control 6 days before perifusion. Perifused pituitaries received pulses of GnRH (peak amplitude, 50 ng/ml; frequency, one per h). In vivo pretreatment with E2, but not T, caused significant increases of in vitro LH and FSH secretion rates for pituitaries of both sexes. Overall, our data demonstrate that gonadectomy does not cause increases in LH and FSH secretory responses to GnRH, and that prior exposure to E2 in vivo has a major stimulatory influence on the in vitro secretion of both gonadotropins regardless of sex.\r"

In the present study, we documented a significant elevation of plasma SRIF-like immunoreactivity in 72-h fasted rats compared to that in fed controls (129.0 +/- 17.9 vs. 38.2 +/- 5.8 pg/ml; P less than 0.01) and used this model of high SRIF tone to further delineate the interrelation between GRF and SRIF in physiological regulation of pulsatile GH secretion. We examined pituitary GH responsiveness to GRF, both in vivo and in vitro, after 72-h exposure to nutritional deprivation and high SRIF secretion. In vivo, GRF-induced GH release was markedly enhanced in the face of high circulating SRIF; freely moving, starved rats released 4- to 8-fold more GH than fed controls in response to rat GRF iv. In vitro, both basal and human GRF-induced GH release were augmented 2- to 4-fold in perifused dispersed anterior pituitary cells of starved rats compared to those in fed controls, and this enhanced responsiveness persisted in the presence of 10(-9) M SRIF. These results demonstrate that SRIF not only inhibits GH secretion stimulated by GRF, but that under different temporal conditions SRIF may act in a paradoxically positive manner to sensitize pituitary GH responsiveness to GRF. Such a cooperative interaction of the two peptides may be necessary to optimize pulsatile GH release. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that the temporal patterning of hypothalamic GRF/SRIF signals to pituitary somatotrophs may be the major determinant for pulsatile GH secretion and, ultimately, body growth.\r"

  ".W": "Factors have been identified that influence the integrity of the barrier generated by Sertoli cells (SC) in culture in a two-chambered assembly. The permeability of the barrier was assessed by determining rates of equilibration of [3H]methoxyinulin or [86Rb]Cl across the Sertoli cell monolayer. The complete system consisted of a confluent monolayer of SC maintained on an extracellular matrix (Matrigel)-coated filter together with peritubular cells on the opposite side of the filter. In confirmation of previous results, levels of plasminogen activator (PA) activity secreted were increased by treatment of SC with FSH or with cAMP derivatives [(Bu)2cAMP (dbcAMP)]. PA levels in the culture medium were inversely related to times required for 50% equilibration of [3H]methoxyinulin across the SC monolayer. Thus, elevated PA levels, elicited by stimulation with FSH or dbcAMP, were associated with a decreased integrity of the barrier generated by SC preparations maintained in serum-free medium in the complete system. The increase in permeability of the barrier in SC elicited by FSH dbcAMP could be prevented, however, by the addition of various antiproteases. FSH actions on barrier function were complex. Effects of FSH that favored barrier integrity were most readily detected when proteolytic activity was inhibited. The addition of intact serum increased the integrity of the barrier, but acid-treated serum depleted of antiproteases had no such effect. We advance the hypothesis that proteases are implicated in modulation of the formation and maintenance of the seminiferous tubule barrier by SC.\r"

Also, measures were made of ADPRT in endometrial nuclei isolated from rats during the estrous cycle, days 1-7 of pseudopregnancy, and days 5-7 of pseudopregnancy after decidual induction on day 4. E treatment produced an increase in ADPRT activity, DNA content, tissue mass, and total protein. P alone did not affect ADPRT activity or DNA content. Enzyme activity and DNA content measured after E plus P treatment were significantly lower than those after estrone treatment and higher than those in vehicle-treated controls. The parallel stimulation of ADPRT activity and DNA synthesis by E supports a role for ADPRT in cellular proliferation. The blockade of E-stimulated ADPRT activity by P is consistent with a previously proposed model of hormonal regulation of rat uterine pyridine nucleotide metabolism. In endometrium from cycling rats, ADPRT activity did not change between metestrus and proestrus, but declined on estrus. After a rise on day 1 of pseudopregnancy, ADPRT activity remained stable through day 5 and declined on day 6. The relatively constant enzyme activity during the cycle and early pseudopregnancy, when hormone levels undergo great changes, may reflect an additional level of control in intact animals not observed in ovariectomized hormone-treated rats. Decidual ADPRT activity declined on day 5, 1 day after uterine trauma, and increased on day 6. This pattern of enzyme activity is consistent with the initial phase of cytodifferentiation, followed by rapid proliferation during early decidualization.\r"

  ".W": "A plasma fraction rich in thyroid hormone-binding globulin (hTBG, human thyropexin) was injected iv into rabbits in order to see whether thyroid hormone concentrations in plasma would increase by return of T3 and T4 from the extravascular space. For this purpose, both [125I]T3 and [131I]T4 were simultaneously injected. After 1 h, or after 16 h in another series of experiments, 50 mg hTBG were injected iv. Thereafter, the mean radioactivity of both [125I]T3 and [131I]T4 in the plasma rose, and reached its peak 20-30 min after hTBG injection; [125I]T3 and [131I]T4 returned to the preinjection value slowly, after more than 3 h. When hTBG was injected 15-16 h after the radioactive hormones, the mean radioactivity of [125I]T3 reached its peak about 1 h after hTBG injection and returned to the base value after approximately 5.5 h, [131I]T4 reached its peak about 1 h after hTBG injection and returned to the base value within 12 h. After injection of hTBG, total T4 and T3 concentrations in plasma increased about 3- to 5-fold over the base values. At the same time, the percentage of both, free T4 and free T3 dropped instantly whereas absolute free T4 and free T3 values remained almost constant. After injection of 500 mg transthyretin (hTBPA), a similar flux of [125I]T3 and [131I]T4 was observed, whereas 500 mg human serum albumin were ineffective. These marked effects of injected hTBG and hTBPA on the serum levels of [125I]T3, [131I]T4, and total T3 indicate that reentry of T3 and T4 into the intravascular compartment is an important component of thyroid hormone distribution and transport. As can be anticipated from the animal experiments, the efficiency of plasmapheresis or hemofiltration methods may be improved by previous application of large doses of hTBPA or hTBG in cases of thyrotoxicosis.\r"

  ".U": "89136926\r", 
  ".W": "Since iodide (I-) inhibits TSH stimulation of cAMP formation, which mediates most of the effects of the hormone, it has been assumed that this accounts for the inhibitory action of iodide on the thyroid. However, TSH stimulation of 32P incorporation into phospholipids and stimulation of thyroid metabolism by other agonists, such as carbachol, phorbol esters, and ionophore A23187, is not cAMP mediated. The present studies examined the effect of iodide on stimulation of glucose oxidation and 32P incorporation into phospholipids by TSH and other agonists to determine if the inhibition of cAMP formation was responsible for the action of iodide. Preincubation of dog thyroid slices for 1 h with iodide (10(-4) M) inhibited TSH-, (Bu)2cAMP-, carbachol-, methylene blue-, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-, ionophore A23187-, prostaglandin E1-, and cholera toxin-stimulated glucose oxidation. I- also inhibited the stimulation by TSH, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, carbachol, and ionophore A23187 of 32P incorporation into phospholipids. The inhibition was similar whether iodide was added 2 h before or simultaneously with the agonist. I- itself sometimes stimulated basal glucose oxidation, but had no effect on basal 32P incorporation into phospholipids. The effects of iodide on basal and agonist-stimulated thyroid metabolism were blocked by methimazole (10(-3) M). When dog thyroid slices were preloaded with 32PO4 or [1-14C]glucose, the iodide inhibition of agonist stimulation disappeared, suggesting that the effect of iodide involves the transport process. In conclusion, I- inhibited stimulation of glucose oxidation and 32P incorporation into phospholipids by all agonists, indicating that the effect is independent of the cAMP system and that iodide autoregulation does not only involve this system. Oxidation and organification of iodide are necessary for the inhibition. The ability of iodide to decrease glucose and 32PO4 transport may play an important role in thyroid autoregulation.\r"

  ".W": "Lactation is associated with a suppression of pituitary GnRH receptors (GnRH-R), and removal of the suckling stimulus for 24 h causes a 4- to 5-fold increase in GnRH-R. These studies were designed to examine the time course of recovery of GnRH-R after pup removal and to determine the roles that GnRH and PRL may play in modulating GnRH-R during lactation and after pup removal. All studies were performed on day 10 postpartum using ovariectomized rats suckling eight or zero pups. GnRH-R had more than doubled by 8 h after pup removal and had increased 4-5 times 16 h after pup removal to reach levels observed in nonsuckled controls. The increase in GnRH-R after pup removal resulted in a significant increase in pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. Maintenance of hyperprolactinemia after pup removal, by injecting ovine PRL, reduced the increase in GnRH-R by about 50%. Simultaneous administration of GnRH with ovine PRL restored GnRH-R to control levels. Administration of a potent antiserum to GnRH at the time of pup removal completely blocked the up-regulation of GnRH-R 24 h later. In the presence of the suckling stimulus and hyperprolactinemia, administration of pharmacological doses of GnRH caused a complete restoration of GnRH-R to levels observed in nonsuckled controls. Inhibition of suckling-induced PRL secretion with CB-154 caused a 2-fold increase in GnRH-R, and this effect could be completely reversed by simultaneous treatment with ovine PRL. These studies show that the suppression of pituitary GnRH-R during lactation appears to be due primarily to inhibition of GnRH secretion. After pup removal, recovery of GnRH-R occurs very rapidly, with recovery (4- to 5-fold increase) being completed by 16 h. Endogenous GnRH secretion is absolutely necessary for the up-regulation of GnRH-R to occur. The decrease in PRL levels after pup removal contributes to this process, most likely by causing an increase in GnRH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), PRL, and gonadotropins in different cell types of the monkey pituitary was examined by immunocytochemical (ICC) labeling of pituitary cell cultures. Dispersed monkey pituitary cells were cultured on extracellular matrix and in serum-free medium for 6-14 days. Individual cultures were singly stained for ER, PR, PRL, LH, and FSH or double labeled for PR and one of the protein hormones. ICC reaction product localizes over the nuclei of cells that are positive for the steroid receptors, whereas reaction product localizes over the cytoplasm of cells that are positive for the protein hormones. Sixty-one percent of the parenchymal cells were positive for PRL, while 1-3% were positive for LH or FSH. Sixty-two percent of the parenchymal cells were ER positive. ER staining was localized over the nuclei of two morphologically distinct cell types. One cell type is smaller and more prevalent than the second cell type. Based on single staining for each of the protein hormones, we propose that the smaller cells are lactotropes, and the larger cells are gonadotropes. PR-positive cells averaged 7.7% of the parenchymal cells. Double ICC staining for PR and the protein hormones demonstrated that PR localize in the nuclei of gonadotropes, but not lactotropes, of monkey pituitary cell cultures. The absence of PR in lactotropes is consistent with our observation that progesterone has no direct effect on PRL secretion in monkey pituitary cell cultures. In contrast, the presence of PR in gonadotropes suggests that progesterone may act directly at the pituitary to modulate gonadotropin secretion in the primate. In conclusion, ER are present in both lactotropes and gonadotropes. PR are present in gonadotropes, but not lactotropes, of the primate pituitary.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in chronic heart failure (HF), the biosynthesis and storage of ANF in cardiac and noncardiac tissues and the level of plasma ANF were measured in rats exhibiting minimal [2-fold rise in left ventricular end diastolic pressure; myocardial infarct (MI) scar length, 25% left ventricle (LV)] and moderate-severe (3-fold rise in left ventricular end diastolic pressure; decreased contractility (dp/dtmax); MI scar length, 47% LV) chronic HF 30 and 60 days after coronary arterial ligation. In rats with moderate-severe HF (30 days post-MI), the cardiac ANF mRNA concentration (determined by dot blot analysis) increased in three heart chambers [LV, 6-fold; left atria (LA), 3-fold; right ventricle (RV), 2-fold], cardiac immunoreactive ANF (IRANF; determined by RIA) concentration increased on the left side (LV, 7-fold; LA, 33%), but was unchanged (RV) or reduced on the right side (right atria, 33%), and plasma IRANF increased 3-fold above sham control values. Excluding the LV (used for MI scar length), the pattern and magnitude of change in ANF mRNA concentration in moderate-severe HF at 60 days were similar to those at 30 days; the cardiac IRANF concentration at this time was the same (LA) or less than (RV, 66%) sham values, and plasma IRANF increased 6-fold above respective sham values. Generally, the changes in the concentrations of cardiac ANF message and peptide and levels of circulating ANF peptide were smaller in rats with minimal HF. The minute quantities of ANF mRNA and IRANF detected in noncardiac tissues (lung, liver, pituitary, aortic arch, brain, kidney, and salivary gland) were unaltered by HF. These findings show that chronic HF, as defined by hemodynamic and histological measurements, specifically and continuously stimulates atrial as well as ventricular ANF biosynthesis; levels of plasma and cardiac ANF are increased early in HF, but with time are subject to modulation. The cardiac ANF system is the prime locus for the effects of HF, as noncardiac ANF biosynthesis and storage are undisturbed by chronic HF.\r"

  ".W": "Microinjection of synthetic GRF into the cerebroventricles or hypothalamus of the rat produces a number of neural effects, including the suppression of GH secretion, possibly representing a negative ultrashort loop autoregulation of GRF and/or stimulation of somatostatin neurosecretion. To demonstrate that such neuromodulation acts physiologically through endogenous GRF activity, the peptidic GRF antagonist (N-Ac-Tyr1,D-Arg2)GRF-(1-29)-NH2 was used to block the action of GRF on its presumed receptors in the hypothalamus. First, to establish the efficacy of the antagonist to block GRF receptors in the anterior pituitary, we injected the antagonist iv at doses of 2, 20, and 50 micrograms or saline (controls) into conscious male rats fitted with jugular cannulae. Sequential blood sampling every 15 min for 6 h between 1000-1600 h showed that 50 micrograms antagonist, iv, significantly suppressed the two periods of spontaneous release of radioimmunoassayable GH in controls in the morning and afternoon. A dose of 20 micrograms, iv, lowered mean plasma GH between 1400-1500 h (P less than 0.025), while the 2-microgram dose was without effect. The GRF antagonist was then microinjected into the third ventricle (3V) of conscious male rats at doses of 0.5 and 8.0 ng in 2 microliter sterile saline. The 8.0-ng dose of 3V antagonist elicited a 3-fold increase in the morning peak of GH (nanograms per ml): 3V antagonist, 159.0 +/- 62.0; 3V control, 51.0 +/- 21.9 (P less than 0.05). The 0.5-ng dose was without effect. Finally, we observed that pretreatment with the GRF antagonist 3V (10 ng), followed 15 min later by 10 ng rat GRF administered 3V, completely blocked the GRF-induced suppression of pulsatile GH release observed earlier. Both the systemic and central effects of the antagonist were specific to the control of GH, since PRL concentrations were unaltered. These results 1) have demonstrated the ability of a peptidic GRF antagonist to specifically suppress pulsatile GH release after its systemic administration, presumably by acting on pituitary GRF receptors, and 2) support the notion that GRF receptors are also present in the hypothalamus and are available for the physiological mediation of GRF-induced inhibition of GH release by a central mechanism.\r"

The peptide was isolated from 1.5 x 10(10) cultured bovine chromaffin cells by reversed phase and ion exchange HPLC. It is chromatographically and structurally distinct from atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), which we formely identified in chromaffin tissue. This new Aldosterone Secretion Inhibitory Factor (ASIF) is predominant in cultured chromaffin cells and cross-reacts with ANF receptor sites involved in the inhibition of aldosterone production in zona glomerulosa cells. The sequence of this 35-amino acid peptide includes the shorter fragment isolated from porcine brain confirming its neuropeptide character. ASIF might be involved in concert with ANF in the paracrine regulation of aldosterone secretion and the presence of both peptides in cultured chromaffin cells indicates that this system can be used as a model for studying natriuretic neuropeptide production.\r"

  ".W": "Basal insulin supplementation has been used as a therapy for patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) who require insulin. To determine whether basal insulin supplementation in addition to lowering postabsorptive plasma glucose concentration also improves the postprandial pattern of glucose disposition, glucose metabolism after ingestion of a solid mixed meal was assessed in obese patients with NIDDM before and after treatment with ultralente and compared with glucose metabolism observed in nondiabetic subjects. Splanchnic uptake of ingested glucose clearance was assessed by including [2-3H]glucose (a tracer that only minimally cycles through glycogen) in a solid mixed meal. Postprandial gluconeogenesis was estimated by measuring the rate of incorporation of carbon dioxide into glucose. Net glucose and lipid oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry. Both splanchnic uptake of ingested glucose (27 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 2 g) and postprandial hepatic glucose release (51 +/- 5 vs. 24 +/- 3 g) were greater (P less than .001) in diabetic than in nondiabetic subjects. Although the percentage of postprandial hepatic glucose release accounted for by glucose synthesis from bicarbonate was similar in the two groups (25 +/- 2 vs. 35 +/- 5%), the absolute rate was greater in the diabetic patients (13 +/- 1 vs. 8 +/- 1 g; P less than .05). Postprandial glucose oxidation and glucose disposal (measured either isotopically or by the forearm-catheterization technique) were similar in both groups. However, total lipid oxidation was increased in the diabetic patients. (P less than .05). Two weeks of basal insulin supplementation lowered fasting glucose concentrations (from 219 +/- 22 to 144 +/- 21 mg/dl; P less than .01) and integrated postprandial glycemic response (from 814 +/- 68 to 621 +/- 72 min.mg.ml-1) but not to normal. Although circulating insulin concentrations were two- to threefold greater (P less than .02) after 3 mo of basal insulin supplementation, the postprandial pattern of glucose metabolism remained essentially the same. Basal insulin supplementation decreased (P less than .05) both splanchnic uptake of ingested glucose and hepatic glucose release. The addition of a preprandial injection of soluble insulin to basal insulin supplementation further suppressed (P less than .05) postprandial hepatic glucose release, thereby further improving postprandial glucose tolerance. These studies indicate that initial splanchnic glucose clearance, hepatic glucose release, and new glucose synthesis, as well as extrahepatic substrate metabolism, are altered in NIDDM after ingestion of a mixed meal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Freshly isolated or low-temperature-cultured BALB/cJ islets were transplanted beneath the kidney capsules of C57BL/6J recipients. The recipients were treated with NIC alone (500 mg.kg-1.day-1), DFX alone (4.2 mg/day x 14 days), or NIC + DFX. Only recipients treated with NIC + DFX, receiving cultured islets, showed a mean graft survival time significantly longer than control mice receiving freshly isolated or cultured islets. Control CD-1 mice treated with multiple low doses of STZ developed insulitis and diabetes. Treatment with NIC alone, DFX alone, or NIC + DFX decreased the severity of hyperglycemia relative to the controls. Treatment with DFX alone was more effective than NIC alone or NIC + DFX. Only the group treated with DFX alone had a lower incidence of diabetes (mean plasma glucose level greater than 200 mg/dl) than the controls after 4 wk. Histologically, islets from control mice showed severe insulitis, islet destruction, and absence of stainable insulin, whereas islets from DFX-treated mice showed only mild peri-insulitis and a relative preservation of beta-cell granulation. Our study showed that NIC and DFX partially protect islets from immune destruction in allograft rejection and in low-dose STZ-induced insulitis. Apparently, hydroxyl radicals play important roles in both of these models.\r"

Rewarming at 200 degrees C/min and removal of DMSO with 0.75 M sucrose preceded 48 h of culture and retesting. Recovery postthaw by microscope count on duplicate aliquots was 94.2 +/- 3.5% of prefreeze counts and by triplicate assay of extractable insulin was 90.0 +/- 22.3% on day 0 and 74.1 +/- 12.6% after a 48-h culture. Nonfrozen islets increased basal insulin secretion 7.7 +/- 2.8 times after stimulation with 300 mg/dl glucose in perifusion, whereas islets frozen-thawed and cultured 48 h increased 6.2 +/- 0.8 times (NS). Peak stimulated insulin release was 0.92 +/- 0.14 microU.islet-1.min-1 before storage and 0.73 +/- 0.14 microU.islet-1.min-1 (79% of control, NS) after freeze-thaw and a 48-h culture. Total insulin secretion (area under curve) was 66% of prefreeze values at 48 h. Immunocytochemical stains revealed preservation of islet morphology postthaw. Electron microscopy showed intact cellular and nuclear membranes and intracellular organelles. Frozen-thawed islets harvested 14 days after renal subcapsular xenografting in nude mice were revascularized and well granulated. Cryopreservation can achieve prolonged storage of large numbers of human islets with high recovery numerically and functionally, making this a feasible approach for future trials of human islet transplantation.\r"

This paper explores lung aeration and lung water dynamics in seven fetal lambs between 139 and 142 days of gestation delivered by caesarean section and ventilated on a constant-volume respirator. After caesarean section and instrumentation, fetal lambs were quickly transferred to a warm X-ray table and connected to a volume-cycled respirator. X-ray fluoroscopic images of the chest commenced before the first breath and were recorded on video tape. After 1 h of ventilation, measurements were made of pulmonary blood volume, and lung samples were taken for wet weight and dry weight analysis. Fluoroscopic image brightness was calibrated by comparison with images obtained from a water wedge, which extended across the X-ray field. Thus image brightness was related to \"equivalent water path length\" through the thorax. Within a defined lung field, image brightness increases as the amount of lung water in the path of the X-ray beam is reduced. This occurs rapidly at first and then more slowly over the remaining hour. There was considerable variation between the reduction of liquid in the lung fields examined within the one animal, as well as the absolute amount of fluid that had been cleared during the 1st h.\r"

Despite these differences, lactating women had significantly lower nitrogen balances compared with the nonlactating women (-4.0 +/- 37.8 vs. +44.7 +/- 30.8 mg.kg-1.day-1). No significant differences in amino acid flux, oxidation, or incorporation into protein were detected during fasting conditions in the two groups of women. However, significantly positive associations were noted between dietary intakes and the variables of protein metabolism in the lactating women. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the disposition of dietary nutrients into maternal body stores or milk production will enhance the determination of nutrient requirements in lactating women.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed respiratory muscle response patterns to chemoreceptor stimuli (hypercapnia, hypoxia, normocapnic hypoxia, almitrine, and almitrine + CO2) in six awake dogs. Mean electromyogram (EMG) activities were measured in the crural (CR) diaphragm, triangularis sterni (TS), and transversus abdominis (TA). Hypercapnia and normocapnic hypoxia caused mild to marked hyperpnea [2-5 times control inspiratory flow (VI)] and increased activity in CR diaphragm, TS, and TA. When hypocapnia was permitted to develop during hypoxia and almitrine-induced moderate hyperpnea, CR diaphragm activity increased, whereas TS and TA activities usually did not change or were reduced below control. Over time in hypercapnia, CR diaphragm, TS, and TA were augmented and maintained at these levels over many minutes; with hypoxic hyperventilation CR diaphragm, TS, and TA were first augmented but then CR diaphragm remained augmented while TS and, less consistently, TA were inhibited over time. Marked hyperpnea (4-5 times control) due to carotid body stimulation increased TA and TS EMG activity despite an accompanying hypocapnia. We conclude that in the intact awake dog 1) carotid body stimulation augments the activity of both inspiratory and expiratory muscles; 2) hypocapnia overrides the augmenting effect of carotid body stimulation on expiratory muscles during moderate hyperpnea, usually resulting in either no change or inhibition; 3) at higher levels of hyperpnea both chemoreceptor stimulation and stimulatory effects secondary to a high ventilatory output favor expiratory muscle activation; these effects override any inhibitory effects of a coincident hypocapnia; and 4) expiratory muscles of the rib cage/abdomen may be augmented/inhibited independently of one another.\r"

In control, four out of six dogs showed PIIA [8-10% of expiratory time (TE)]; all showed delay of diaphragm [19% of inspiratory time (TI)], delay of abdominal muscle activation (21% of TE), and PEEA (24% of TI). Hypercapnia decreased PIIA (4-9% of TE), maintained diaphragm delay at near control values (23% of TI), increased PEEA (36% of TI), eliminated delay of abdominal muscle activation (4% of TE), and decreased end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). Hypocapnic hypoxia increased PIIA (24-25% of TE), eliminated diaphragm delay (3% of TI), eliminated PEEA (3% of TI), reduced delay of abdominal muscle activation (14% of TE), and increased EELV. Most of these effects of hypoxic hypocapnia vs. hypercapnia on the within-breath EMG timing parameters corresponded to differences in the magnitude of expiratory muscle activation. These changes exerted significant influences on flow rates and EELV.\r"

We studied the effects of two levels of brain hypoxia without carotid body stimulation, produced by inhalation of CO, on ventilatory (VI) and genioglossal (EMGgg) and diaphragmatic (EMGdi) responses to CO2 rebreathing in awake, unanesthetized goats. Neither delta VI/delta PCO2 nor VI at a PCO2 of 60 Torr was significantly different between the three conditions studied (0%, 25%, and 50% carboxyhemoglobin, HbCO). There were also no significant changes in delta EMGdi/delta PCO2 or EMGdi at a PCO2 of 60 Torr during progressive brain hypoxia. In contrast, delta EMGgg/delta PCO2 and EMGgg at a PCO2 of 60 Torr were significantly increased at 50% HbCO compared with either normoxia or 25% HbCO (P less than 0.05). The PCO2 threshold at which inspiratory EMGgg appeared was also decreased at 50% HbCO (45.6 +/- 2.6 Torr) compared with normoxia (55.0 +/- 1.4 Torr, P less than 0.02) or 25% HbCO (53.4 +/- 1.6 Torr, P less than 0.02). We conclude that moderate brain hypoxia (50% HbCO) in awake, unanesthetized animals results in disproportionate augmentation of EMGgg relative to EMGdi during CO2 rebreathing. This finding is most likely due to hypoxic cortical depression with consequent withdrawal of tonic inhibition of hypoglossal inspiratory activity.\r"
