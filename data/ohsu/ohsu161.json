  ".W": "Although meiotic gene conversion has long been known to be accompanied by crossing-over, a direct test of the converse has not been possible. An experiment was designed to determine whether crossing-over is accompanied by gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nine restriction site heterologies were introduced into a 9-kilobase chromosomal interval that exhibits 22 percent crossing-over. Of all the exchange events that occurred, at least 59 percent of meiotic crossovers are accompanied by gene conversion of one or more of the restriction site heterologies. The average gene conversion tract length was 1.5 kilobases. An unexpected result was that the introduction of as few as seven heterozygosities significantly altered the outcome of recombination events, reducing the frequency of crossovers by 50 percent and increasing the number of exceptional tetrads. This alteration results from a second recombination event induced by repair of heteroduplex DNA containing multiple mismatched base pairs.\r"

Antibodies from human serum to Sm proteins were used to show that four snRNAs (snR7, snR14, snR19, and snR20) can be immunoprecipitated from yeast extracts. Three of these four, snR7, snR14, and snR20, have been shown to be analogs of mammalian U5, U4, and U2, respectively. Several regions of significant homology to U1 (164 nucleotides) have now been found in cloned and sequenced snR19 (568 nucleotides). These include ten out of ten matches to the 5' end of U1, the site known to interact with the 5' splice site of mammalian introns. Surprisingly, the precise conservation of this sequence precludes perfect complementarity between snR19 and the invariant yeast 5' junction (GTATGT), which differs from the mammalian consensus at the fourth position (GTPuAGT).\r"

The flexibility and allostery of this receptor was examined by placing sulfhydryl groups as potential cross-linking sites at targeted locations in the protein. Seven different mutant receptors were constructed, each containing a single cysteine residue at a different position in the primary structure. Intramolecular disulfide bond formation within oligomers of these mutant receptors is shown to trap structural fluctuations and to detect ligand-induced changes in structure. The results indicate that the receptor oligomer has a flexible, dynamic structure which undergoes a global change upon aspartate binding.\r"

The subsequent regeneration of sympathetic axons into the iris of one eye bathed by the INO antibody, which inhibits neurite growth in vitro, was compared with the regrowth of sympathetic axons into the iris of the animal's other eye, which contained control antibody. Antibodies were released within the eye by implanted hybridoma cells. Neurite regeneration was measured by assaying [3H]norepinephrine uptake into freshly explained irides. The blockage of the function of the INO antigen by the antibody resulted in a decreased rate of axonal regeneration, thus suggesting the involvement of the INO antigen in the process of neurite regeneration in vivo.\r"

Internal deletions were created in the region of the nucleotide fold. A set of deletions that collectively span 145 contiguous amino acids yielded active enzymes. Further extensions of the deletions yielded inactive or unstable proteins. The three-dimensional structure of an evidently homologous protein suggests that the active deletions lack portions of a segment that connects two parts of the nucleotide fold. Therefore, the results imply that removal of major sections of the polypeptide that connects these two parts of the fold does not result in major perturbation of the nucleotide binding site.\r"

In a series of rabbits with medullary damage, the authors attempted selectively to interrupt the pathways that mediate proprioceptive input. Unilateral lesion of the dorsal column and posterior horn of the spinal cord was performed using three different techniques: coagulation with laser, stereotaxic microcoagulation, and longitudinal electrocoagulation. Of 32 operated rabbits, 17 developed scoliosis, exhibiting clear pathologic damage of the spinal cord. Electrophysiologic study, including EMG and analysis of the tonic -- vibratory reflex, was performed on 10 rabbits with medullary damage (scoliotic and non-scoliotic) and 12 matched controls. The data suggest disturbance of the sensory afferences that control the postural tone and consequent muscular imbalance, expressed as reduced activity in the muscles of the convex side. This work supports the view that loss of proprioceptive neural impulses caused by medullary damage can induce scoliosis.\r"

After 3 days of therapy, piroxicam patients showed a statistically greater amount of pain relief in the lying (P less than 0.001), sitting (P less than 0.01), and standing (P less than 0.01) positions, but after 7 days the difference between treatments was no longer significant. After 1 week's therapy, however, the requirement for additional analgesic was significantly lower in the piroxicam group (P less than 0.05), and more piroxicam than placebo patients (42 versus 28) had returned to work (P less than 0.05). Toleration was excellent in most patients, with only 13% of the piroxicam and 17% of the placebo group reporting adverse effects of mainly mild or moderate severity. The profile of the adverse effects was similar for both treatments. Piroxicam can provide effective relief of acute low-back pain with good toleration; it should be considered for use in the initial treatment of this condition.\r"

THC was complicated in 17 of 58 patients or 18 of 68 attempts due to bacteremia or fever in four, subcapsular hematoma in two and Ring catheter shearing and apical pneumothorax in one each. THC related deaths occurred in four patients. In uncomplicated THC, the mean hematocrit value decreased from 35.9 +/- 5.8 (n = 39) to 34.1 +/- 4.8 (n = 39) (p less than 0.02). Of THC attempts, 8.8 per cent failed; before THC, ultrasonography (UTZ) in most of these showed no dilation of the bile ducts. THC showing dilated ducts had a significantly higher (p less than 0.01) bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels (14.8 +/- 8.7 milligrams per cent, n = 46 and 414 +/- 283.9 units, n = 46) compared with the THC showing no dilation (5.29 +/- 5.45 milligrams per cent, n = 13 and 235 +/- 294.1 units, n = 13). Of the 30 patients given ampicillin and gentamicin before THC, only three had bacteremia develop; two of six who were untreated and nine of 47 of those pretreated with other antibiotics had bacteremia develop. Of seven instances of stones of the common bile duct found at operation, computed tomography diagnosed zero of seven; UTZ, two of seven, and THC, seven of seven. No THC gave a misleading diagnosis. Eighteen palliative transhepatic drains were attempted with the THC (15 successfully). A significant (p less than 0.01) 50 per cent decrease in the bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels were obtained by catheter drainage but neither test returned to normal. THC is not a benign procedure and should be done only if bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase, or both, are elevated above 5 milligrams per cent and 200 units, respectively, and UTZ shows dilated biliary ducts. Pretreatment with antibiotics and operating room availability are important to limit THC morbidity.\r"

Nineteen of 21 lesions weighing more than 300 milligrams were identified, whereas only 50 per cent of the lesions weighing less than 300 milligrams could be seen. The scans demonstrated 12 of 14 lesions with C-terminal parathyroid hormone levels of more than 900 picograms per milliliter but only 60 per cent of the lesions that produced levels of less than 900 picograms per milliliter.

This anatomy was compared with 14 additional autopsies performed upon older children. There was no significant difference in diameter between the internal jugular and subclavian venous system, on either the right or left side. In the infant, the right and left subclavian veins entered the central system at an acute angle. The left innominate vein joined the right innominate vein at a right angle. These angulations become less acute after one year of age. This adult configuration may account for the relative ease of central venous cannulation through the percutaneous subclavian approach in the older patient. In contrast, the external and internal jugular veins entered centrally in almost a straight line even in the infant. The findings of this study suggest that the internal and external jugular veins should be considered as safe and reliable portals for percutaneous entry into the central venous system in infants. In the infant less than one year of age, the difficult patient (for example, those with thrombocytopenia or severe pulmonary failure) or when the surgeon is less familiar with the infraclavicular approach, the veins of the neck may, in fact, be the site of choice. Additionally, we believe that a surgeon should not hesitate to switch to the internal or external jugular site after unsuccessful attempts at percutaneous entry into the subclavian vein.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of estrogen receptors in human meningiomas has long been a controversial issue. This may be explained, in part, by apparent heterogeneity of estrogen binding sites in meningioma tissue. In this study, estrogen receptors were determined in 58 meningiomas with an enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies against human estrogen receptor protein (estrophilin) and with a sensitive radioligand binding assay using 125I-labeled estradiol (125I-estradiol) as radioligand. Low levels of estrophilin immunoreactivity were found in tumors from 62% of patients, whereas radioligand binding activity was demonstrated in about 46% of the meningiomas examined. In eight (14%) tissue samples multiple binding sites for estradiol were observed. The immunoreactive binding sites correspond to the classical, high affinity estrogen receptors: the Kd for 125I-estradiol binding to the receptor was approximately 0.2 nM and the binding was specific for estrogens. The second, low affinity class of binding sites considerably influenced measurement of the classical receptor even at low ligand concentrations. The epidemiological and clinical data from patients with meningiomas, and the existence of specific estrogen receptors confirmed by immunochemical detection, may be important factors in a theory of oncogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "87320104\r", 
  ".W": "During the years 1970 to 1985, 463 patients with obliterative atherosclerosis at the femoropopliteal level underwent elective surgery. The operation performed was an autologous saphenous vein bypass using the reversed technique. The vascular surgical treatment was documented in reasonable detail (both baseline and follow-up) in accordance with the documentation system of the Austrian Society of Vascular Surgery. On-line data entry with use of SAS data-base management software was used. The patency curves were estimated in accordance with the Kaplan-Meier method; possible differences were checked by means Breslow's and Mantel's tests. The preoperative clinical status (claudicants, n = 200; limb salvage, n = 263) influenced the postoperative results in a statistically significant manner (Breslow p less than 0.01; Mantel p less than 0.03). All the other risk factors analyzed (site of distal anastomosis above versus below the knee, n = 231, and n = 232, respectively; Breslow p less than 0.58, Mantel p less than 0.58. Presence [n = 122] or nonpresence [n = 341], of diabetes mellitus [Breslow p less than 0.77, Mantel p less than 0.68]; smoking habits [nonsmokers, n = 93, smokers n = 370, Breslow p less than 0.68, Mantel p less than 0.69;]) did not reach statistical significance. Anticoagulant treatment (n = 101) had no effect (Breslow p less than 0.93, Mantel p less than 0.72), even when the therapy was restricted to cases with disease at advanced clinical stages (stages III, IV; n = 50; Breslow p less than 0.55, Mantel p less than 0.95). On the basis of these analyses, a prospective trial was initiated in 1979. Eighty-eight patients were studied; those in group I (n = 42) received dicumarol, and those in group II (n = 46) were controls who did not receive anticoagulant treatment. At present, the median follow-up time is at 30 months. Treatment with dicumarol favorably influenced graft patency (Breslow, p less than 0.03, Mantel p less than 0.07; one-tailed tests). The patients' preoperative clinical status affected the results of surgery (Breslow p less than 0.03, Mantel p less than 0.02; one-tailed tests). In relation to the preoperative clinical status, a therapeutic effect was observed in stages III and IV (n = 45; Breslow p less than 0.03, Mantel p less than 0.07; one-tailed tests), while no effect of therapy was demonstrable in claudicants (n = 43; Breslow p less than 0.3, Mantel p less than 0.4; one-tailed tests).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The functional outcome in these animals was compared with animals that received intrasplenically autotransplanted pancreatic islet cell preparations from unstored pancreases. Normoglycemia was restored in 15 of 20 (75%) dogs that received freshly prepared islets. Two of five dogs (40%) whose pancreases were stored in CS for 3 hours became normoglycemic, as did 2 of 5 dogs (40%) whose pancreases were stored for 3 hours in SGF. When 6-hour storage was used only 1 of 5 dogs (20%) whose pancreases were stored in CS and 1 of 5 dogs (20%) in whom SGF was used for storage became normoglycemic. Normoglycemia occurred in only 2 of 16 dogs (12.5%) whose pancreases were stored for 24 hours (one in SGF and one in CS). The results indicate that islet cell preparation should be performed immediately after pancreatectomy. The failure thus far of clinical islet allotransplantation may be due, at least in part, to functional deterioration during preservation of the donor pancrease before isolation of islet cells.\r"

  ".U": "87320108\r", 
  ".W": "We attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of neutrophil (PMN) activation after burn injury. We previously reported prolonged elevations of PMN cell surface complement (C) opsonin receptor levels after burn trauma with a corresponding period of depressed PMN chemotaxis to C5a, which suggests that the C product, C5a, was responsible for PMN activation. However, a lack of direct correlation of C activation with C receptor levels soon after injury raised the possibility of a second PMN-activating substance. We therefore investigated the effect of endotoxin (LPS) on the expression of the C receptors (CR1 and CR3) by normal human PMNs. Concentrations from 0 to 50 ng/ml of LPS 026:B6 caused a dose response increase in the PMN surface expression of CR1 and CR3 as assessed by monoclonal antibody binding and indirect immunofluorescence. The relative CR1-dependent fluorescence rose from a mean of 50 to 385 and CR3 from 50 to 300. Chelation by ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) did not influence this dose response, thus ruling out the possibility of C activation by LPS--an inference supported by the lack of complement activation observed with these concentrations of LPS in normal serum. A similar dose response was obtained in the absence of other cell types or serum, which implies a direct effect that mimicked that of C5a. To determine the mechanism of the later, prolonged C activation after burn injury, we next examined C activation products in 22 patients with burn injuries. Elevations of plasma C3a desArg were present and persisted for 50 days. Elevations were at maximum levels on days 9 through 13 postburn (mean +/- standard error of mean [SEM], 496 +/- 47 ng/ml versus normal 113 +/- 32; p less than 0.01). These were accompanied by elevations of C4a desArg (917 +/- 154 ng/ml versus normal 424 +/- 50; p less than 0.01), which are indicative of classic pathway activation. Finally, we examined PMN function, phagocytosis and percentage killing of Staphylococcus aureus, and found PMN function to be unaltered in the 22 patients. Thus PMN activation after burn injury appears to be caused by LPS soon after injury and by C5a later after injury and affects only selected PMN functions.\r"

Internal carotid stenosis was found in 38% (21 of 56) of subjects and lower extremity arterial disease in 42% (23 of 55). The strongest predictor of internal carotid stenosis was lower extremity arterial disease. Independent risk factors for lower extremity arterial disease were smoking, internal carotid stenosis, and age. A measure of extent of carotid plaque was found to correlate with age, carotid stenosis, male sex, history of smoking, and total cholesterol. The high prevalence of peripheral vascular disease in this population may be related to their age and blood pressure. The high correlation between carotid stenosis and lower extremity arterial disease suggests that persons with peripheral vascular disease should be assessed and treated for atherosclerotic disease in general.\r"

Only 3 of 56 patients had hemodynamic obstruction of flow at the carotid artery bifurcation, and 41 of 56 had no evidence of any atherosclerotic disease. Other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease were present in 24 of 56 patients, but only 1 had a prior cerebrovascular event. The pathophysiology of transient global amnesia appears to differ from the pathophysiology of classical transient ischemic attacks in that there is no clear relation between transient global amnesia and the presence of extracranial atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.\r"

The average difference from the mean of duplicate SPT results was 5.94 percent of the optical density value. The data also demonstrated a linear and overlapping relationship between the scores of manual IAHG tests and SPT optical density values. The accuracy of the SPT declined slightly as the concentration of red cell samples increased; the optimum concentration of immunoglobulin used in the preparation of the solid phase was about 275 mg per l. The 97.5th percentile of negative tests occurred at the same optical density (0.13) when serums from either healthy donors or hospitalized patients were tested. Compatibility tests completed on 1304 blood samples from donors and 437 serum samples from hospitalized patients showed that 1.38 percent of results were SPT-positive and manual IAHG-negative, and 5.37 percent were SPT-negative and manual IAHG-positive. The lowest possible score in the manual test was allocated to 97.14 percent of the latter group, indicating good correlation between the two techniques.\r"

The automated water-path system is soothing to small children, maintains the body temperature of infants, and avoids direct transducer contact. Sedation is not necessary. Excellent resolution, shorter scan time than computed tomography, and greater flexibility of patient and transducer positioning allows much more complete imaging information.

  ".W": "One hundred and eleven carotid vessels in 56 patients were analysed by high-resolution duplex ultrasound. Vessels were graded as normal, 25, 50 or 75% stenotic and 100% occluded and the results were compared with similarly graded biplanar angiograms. There was absolute agreement in 68.5% of the vessels, agreement within one grade of severity of disease in 27.0%, while poor correlation was obtained in 4.5%. The results of ultrasound and angiography were also related to the surgical specimens obtained after thrombendarterectomy of 23 vessels in 20 patients. Good agreement was obtained between the three methods in 20/23 vessels. In one case ultrasound was better than angiography, in another case the reverse was true and in a third case both methods overdiagnosed a plaque. It is concluded that duplex ultrasound will work in the hands of a clinician and is a reliable non-invasive screening method for carotid artery disease leading to a more optimal selection of candidates for angiography.\r"

We have therefore studied the effect of dietary calcium on blood pressure in two groups of women. In a cross-sectional study 103 early postmenopausal women were stratified into three groups according to daily calcium intake calculated from a questionnaire. Both diastolic and systolic blood pressures were identical in the three groups. We thereafter conducted a prospective placebo-controlled trial on the effect of calcium supplementation. Twenty-eight healthy women were randomized to placebo treatment (n = 14) or calcium supplementation 2,000 mg daily (n = 14) for one year. In both groups BP remained at initial levels throughout the study and was identical in the two groups at measurements every three months. We thus conclude that calcium supplementation has no effect on BP in normotensive subjects on a high calcium diet.\r"

Insulin was given as an i.v. infusion of 2.4 U/h over 180 min alone, or together with metoprolol (3.0 mg i.v. bolus followed by an i.v. infusion of 4.8 mg/h) in random order. Blood glucose, counter-regulatory hormones, hypoglycemic symptoms and the cardiovascular responses were assayed over 240 min. Metoprolol did not significantly modify the blood glucose levels. The plasma levels of free insulin, however, were elevated by approximately 20% (p less than 0.01) by metoprolol during hypoglycemia and the plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone and cortisol were enhanced by the drug. Sweating was increased by metoprolol, while other symptoms were unaltered. We conclude that metoprolol administered acutely does not aggravate prolonged hypoglycemia in diabetics with blunted response of glucagon. Moreover, exaggerated responses of counter-regulatory hormones, provoked by metoprolol, may compensate for the inhibitory effect of this drug on insulin clearance.\r"

  ".W": "In three different diabetes centers the use of insulin at a strength of 40 IU/ml (U40) and 100 IU/ml (U100) in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment of insulin dependent (Type I) diabetic patients was compared in a randomized cross-over design. Forty-six Type I diabetic patients, all previously treated with CSII for at least one year, completed consecutively two 13-week periods of treatment with U40 and U100. Body weight and insulin requirements were identical at the end of the two periods. Slightly higher levels of glycemia were recorded during U40 when compared to U100 treatment: mean blood glucose was 142 +/- 34 (SD) vs. 133 +/- 34 mg/dl (2 p less than 0.01). The same tendency was observed in the mean glycosylated hemoglobin value (6.84 +/- 1.35 vs. 6.65 +/- 1.13%, 2 p greater than 0.1). There were no significant differences between U40 and U100 in the number of catheters used and the number of catheter blockages reported, while the development of subcutaneous nodules at the insertion sites was significantly more frequent during U40 treatment. It is concluded that the implementation of insulin in the strength of 100 IU/ml is as effective as the use of insulin in the strength of 40 IU/ml for CSII therapy, and might even be associated with slightly improved glycemic control and less subcutaneous side-effects.\r"

To examine the influence of physical inactivity on insulin sensitivity, we measured oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) and insulin response to glucose in 18 patients immobilized to bed for six weeks after acute spine fracture. The results were compared to those of nine chronically immobilized spinal cord injury patients and to eight healthy mobile controls. During the first week after trauma both glucose and insulin responses in the OGTT were two- to three-fold above normal (p less than 0.01). The index of insulin resistance (glucose area X insulin area) was seven-fold greater than in healthy controls (p less than 0.001). After three weeks' immobilization insulin resistance had declined by 30-35% (p less than 0.05) being then at the level observed in chronically immobilized subjects. After remobilization the insulin resistance was further decreased but remained still 2.3 times higher than in controls. Thus, trauma causes a manifold increase in insulin resistance, which is reduced but not normalized during the subsequent immobilization and remobilization.\r"

In Study I, 60 females were treated for a two-month period with general dietary advice, providing a mean daily energy intake of 1,400 kcal. In addition, the fibre group received a 5 g dietary fibre supplement. In Study II, 45 females were treated for a three-month period with a similar programme, in which the recommended daily energy intake was 1,600 kcal and the fibre supplement 7 g/day. In both groups weight changes, hunger ratings, blood pressure, defecation pattern and possible side-effects were recorded every second week. Before treatment mean body weight was 95.4 kg (Study I) and 99.3 kg (Study II). Six patients dropped out of Study I, and four out of Study II. In Study I mean weight loss, 7.0 kg, in the fibre group was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than 6.0 kg in the placebo group. In Study II mean weight loss in the fibre group of 6.2 kg was significantly higher than the 4.1 kg in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). No significant difference in hunger feeling between the groups was found. Systolic blood pressure was reduced in all four groups at the end of the treatment, whereas diastolic blood pressure was reduced only in the fibre group in Study II. The results suggest that dietary fibre is of additive value in the treatment of moderately obese patients. The fibre supplement, however, needs to be comparatively high.\r"

When normal, these vessels had hypoechoic or anechoic lumina, sharply echogenic walls, and characteristic Doppler flow patterns that varied with changes in intrathoracic pressure. Most thrombosed vessels had poorly defined walls and echogenic lumina. All had absent flow on Doppler analysis. Duplex Doppler sonography was positive in all 10 patients subsequently shown to have venous thrombosis by venography or CT. One false-positive result occurred in a technically limited study. Sonography has the advantages of portability, ease of performance, and high patient acceptance. Duplex Doppler has advantages over either continuous-wave Doppler or imaging sonography alone. Our experience suggests that duplex Doppler sonography should be the initial diagnostic study in evaluating suspected thrombosis of the upper extremity thoracic inlet veins.\r"

Thirty-eight shunts were patent, and in 33 of these, the shunt was directly visualized and flow was observed with Doppler sonography. Eight shunts were obstructed. After a successful portosystemic shunt procedure, flow in the shunted splanchnic vein was directed toward the shunt and the systemic vein. We studied the intrahepatic portal venous circulation in all of the patients; we found that in the presence of patent portosystemic shunt, portal flow is hepatofugal. This reversal of blood flow occurred in all but four patients. In the end-to-side portacaval shunt, where the portal vein is ligated, blood in intrahepatic portal branches presumably reaches the shunt through perihepatic collaterals. In the presence of a thrombosed shunt, intrahepatic portal venous flow was hepatopetal. To our knowledge, this is the first noninvasive in vivo study of intrahepatic portal circulation after portosystemic shunt surgery. The duplex Doppler evaluation of portosystemic shunts appears to be reliable and should be the method of choice for shunt patency assessment in patients with recurrent signs of portal hypertension. In addition to demonstrating flow at the site of the anastomosis, the Doppler study may yield an easy and reliable sign of shunt patency: reversed flow (hepatofugal flow) in the intrahepatic portal veins probably signals a patent shunt, even if the site of the anastomosis cannot be visualized directly by sonography.\r"

The results of the imaging procedures performed in eight patients treated in this fashion were retrospectively analyzed. All of the patients had angiography; seven had MR imaging and two had Doppler sonography. The demonstration of shunt patency, stenosis, or occlusion by MR and Doppler sonography was confirmed by angiography in all cases. We conclude that MR imaging may serve as an accurate screening method to assess shunt patency and to determine which patients require angiography to obtain hemodynamic data. Doppler sonography may also be a useful screening method, but additional data must be obtained to assess its role in evaluation of shunt patency.\r"

Four new patients are presented here, all of whom had cerebral manifestations due to elevated blood-ammonia levels. One patient, initially misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder, had multiple small portohepatic venous shunts in the peripheral hepatic parenchyma that were believed to be congenital in origin. The other three patients with clinical evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension had large tubular shunts between the posterior branch of the portal vein and the inferior vena cava. Shunts of this type were considered to be the collateral pathways developed in the hepatic parenchyma as a result of portal hypertension. The diagnosis of intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts was established by angiography in all four patients. Sonography and CT failed to show the multiple small shunts, but did provide diagnostic information concerning the large tubular shunts. Intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt can be the cause of hepatic encephalopathy. One should be familiar with the typical radiographic manifestations of this condition to prevent misdiagnosis as a psychiatric or neurologic disorder.\r"

The outcome of these pregnancies was unfavorable in 15 cases (71%) and correlated well with the relative and absolute size of the hematoma, severity of vaginal bleeding, change in hematoma size on follow-up examination, and presence of pain. There was no significant correlation between the outcome and the echogenicity of the hematoma, presence of placental margin elevation, gestational and maternal age, gravidity, or parity. All hematomas extended to the margin of the placenta. Subchorionic hemorrhage is a frequent cause of first and second trimester bleeding and has a grave prognosis. Familiarity with the varied sonographic appearances and meticulous sonographic examination with special attention to the placental margins can be helpful in the diagnosis.\r"

Underlying causes of joint disease included ischemic necrosis (20 grafts), osteochondritis dissecans (nine), chondromalacia patellae (10), and posttraumatic osteochondral fracture with degenerative disease (two). Congruity with the adjacent native articular surface and the opposite side of the joint was evident on immediate postoperative radiographs in all patients, and proved to be critical to the ultimate success of the procedure. On follow-up radiographs over a period of 2-28 months, successful incorporation of the allograft was characterized by progressive loss of the relative increased density of the graft, in association with diminished lucency related to new bone formation at the graft-native bone interface, as well as maintained alignment. Graft failure was associated with positional changes including collapse, persistent increased density, and poorly defined fragmentation that occasionally simulated infection radiographically and resulted in intraarticular bodies. Resurfacing of diseased articulations with osteochondral shell allografts constitutes a potentially desirable alternative to total joint arthroplasty, particularly among younger patients. Consequently, an awareness of the expected radiographic alterations associated with graft incorporation and failure is important.\r"

Previous procedures on these thigh collections included seven operations and 12 nondiagnostic ward aspirations. All collections were shown by sonography to be either anterior or anterolateral. Two cases referred for drainage were posteromedial; sonography showed these to be mycotic pseudoaneurysms. The abscesses were either anechoic or hypoechoic, and occasionally had debris and septations. Abscesses associated with underlying osteomyelitis abutted the femur; those related to other causes generally were more superficial within muscle or fascial layers. Sonographically guided catheter drainage successfully cured all patients, even those in whom ward aspiration or formal surgery had been unsuccessful. Sonography is a simple and inexpensive method of imaging and guiding the drainage of thigh abscesses. Percutaneous catheter drainage is the treatment of choice in cases in which simple emergency room or ward incision and drainage are inadequate.\r"

Differences in the physical state of water within tissues determine the extent to which the motion of water is restricted by binding to hydrophilic macromolecules (e.g., protein), which in turn causes variable amounts of T1 and T2 shortening. Understanding these concepts and knowing the location in the body of free water, cellular tissues, fat, collagen, bone, and tissue iron improve the radiologist's ability to extract useful information from MR images.\r"

In group II, however, peak acceleration was 12 +/- 2 m/sec/sec on day 1 and increased to only 15 +/- 4 m/sec/sec on day 6 (NS). These results indicate that LV performance, based upon peak acceleration of blood in the ascending aorta, improves markedly within 6 days in patients suffering their first MI uncomplicated by CHF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A new agent for use in contrast echocardiography that is capable of passing through the pulmonary circulation and opacifying the left ventricular cavity after intravenous injection was evaluated in a canine model. Air-filled albumin microbubbles were produced by sonication. A Coulter counter was used to size and count the resultant microbubbles in vitro. The microbubbles had diameters sufficiently small (less than 9 micron) to permit transpulmonary passage. A total of 72 injections were made into the forepaw vein of five closed-chest dogs. Simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiographic images of the right ventricle and the left ventricle were recorded and digitized on an off-line computer. Of the 72 injections, 59 (82%) were suitable for digitization. Forty of the 59 digitized injections (68%) demonstrated left ventricular contrast enhancement. Indicator-dilution curves were generated from plots of intraventricular gray level VS time, and the curve widths and areas under the curves were determined. The ratio of total indicator curve area for left to right ventricular cavity was 0.39 for the 40 successful injections, indicating transpulmonary transmission of 39% of the contrast effect. Injection of bubbles with mean size less than 6 microns resulted in a larger median left ventricular curve area than those with bubbles averaging from 6 to 9 microns. Injections demonstrating successful left ventricular contrast opacification had larger right ventricular curve areas than those that were not successful. Blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial blood gases were not significantly altered by repeated intravascular contrast injections. Postmortem examination of hearts, lungs, livers, and kidneys revealed no histologic changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Uncertainties associated with EPS include a lack of consensus with respect to stimulation protocol, end points for VT suppression during drug testing, significance of induced polymorphic VT or VF, and timing of EPS after myocardial infarction. Despite methodologic shortcomings in most clinical studies, a useful body of knowledge has emerged. In cardiac arrest survivors, incidence of inducible sustained VT ranged from 35% to 75%. Where induced VT (sustained or nonsustained) was successfully suppressed, recurrent arrhythmic events occurred in 0% to 33% of patients over a 1- to 5-year follow-up period. Failed regimens correlated with a high risk of arrhythmic recurrence. EPS also helps to select patients for the implantable defibrillator or electrocardiac surgery. In conclusion, EPS appears empirically useful in the management of cardiac arrest survivors with coronary artery disease; its value in other disease entities is uncertain.\r"

New data suggest that the presence of silent ischemia, like symptomatic ischemia, is indicative of an increased risk of future cardiac events. Ordinarily, patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease are evaluated first for the presence of myocardial ischemia by performing exercise ECG, used as a test of both diagnosis and prognosis. In those patients who have an \"intermediate\" probability of cardiac event after exercise ECG, prognostic assessment may be enhanced, by using either radionuclide stress testing, to assess the extent and severity of potentially inducible ischemia, or ambulatory ECG, to assess the frequency and duration of spontaneously occurring ischemia. The indications for testing and type of test to be used are highly dependent on a number of clinical factors, not the least of which are the nature of the population to be evaluated and the exercise ECG response. We have proposed an overall approach for prognostic testing that considers the potential strengths and limitations of each form of testing. This potential approach now requires prospective evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-four patients with reproducible exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias were enrolled in an open-label, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of oral nadolol therapy. There were 53 men and 11 women ranging in age from 19 to 75 years (mean 53.9). The severity of arrhythmias varied from frequent ventricular premature beats to nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardias. Using serial treadmill exercise tests, patients underwent dose titration for 1 month and were followed up for 3 to 6 months. Depending on drug tolerance and response to treadmill exercise testing, the single daily required dose of oral nadolol ranged from 20 to 240 mg (average 66). Twenty-three (36%) of the patients experienced a total of 30 adverse effects of nadolol therapy; however, only 9 (14%) patients had to be withdrawn from the study. The adverse effects observed were those commonly associated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and all were dose-dependent and reversible. At the last patient visit, the severity of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias was significantly decreased compared with pretreatment in 36 (75%) of 48 evaluable patients. Eighteen (38%) of the patients demonstrated total suppression of arrhythmias. This was accompanied by significant increases from pretreatment in both the mean duration of symptom-limited exercise (+1.02 +/- 0.41 minutes, p less than 0.05) and the mean time of exercise required for arrhythmia induction (+1.80 +/- 0.66 minutes, p less than 0.01), a significant decrease from pretreatment in the mean peak exercise double-product (-4,775, p less than 0.001) and a decrease in the incidence of exercise-induced ST-segment depression (-33%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Findings of a few clinical studies suggest that beta blockade in combination with digitalis therapy may be of benefit in these patients. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 8-week study of 32 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, the effects of digoxin therapy alone were compared with a combination of digoxin and nadolol. Criteria for entry into the study included ventricular rate at rest greater than or equal to 80/min or greater than or equal to 120/min with exercise, and serum digoxin levels within the therapeutic range. After digoxin dose titration to produce therapeutic levels, digoxin dosage remained constant throughout the balance of the study. After a 2-week, single-blind placebo lead-in period, patients were randomized to receive either digoxin plus placebo or a combination of digoxin and nadolol. The dose of nadolol/placebo was titrated from 20 to 120 mg daily as tolerated. Twenty-four hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings, symptom-limited exercise treadmill tests and serum digoxin and nadolol levels were obtained at the end of the single and double-blind treatment periods. Comparing endpoint with baseline, results from Holter recordings showed that patients treated with a combination of digoxin and nadolol had significant (p less than 0.001) decreases in 24 hour average (78 +/- 4 to 63 +/- 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the third week, the patients were referred to a university hospital, where the patency rate of the infarct-related artery was studied by selective coronary arteriography and left ventricular function by radionuclide angiography. Fifty-five patients received heparin and 52 streptokinase within a mean period of 190 minutes after the onset of symptoms. Seven patients in the heparin group and 4 in the streptokinase group died in hospital. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery was identical in both groups (69% in the heparin group vs 68% in the streptokinase group). Left ventricular ejection fraction was not statistically different (0.44 +/- 0.13 in the heparin group vs 0.45 +/- 0.12 in the streptokinase group). Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in patients with a patent infarct-related artery than in patients with an obstructed infarct-related artery (0.49 +/- 0.12 vs 0.41 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.01).

Carvedilol, 25 mg, produced smaller, directionally similar changes in exercise performance, which did not reach statistical significance except for time to 1 mm of ST depression. Both drugs in the 50-mg dose reduced ST-segment depression similarly at maximal and submaximal work levels and lowered heart rate and rate-pressure product at maximal and submaximal work. Carvedilol, 50 mg alone, significantly lowered maximal systolic pressure and rate-pressure product at 1 mm of ST-segment depression. Despite some evidence of vasodilator activity for carvedilol, there was no significant difference in antianginal efficacy with a conventional beta-blocking drug.\r"

At baseline, age, diuretic use and presence of other rest electrocardiographic abnormalities were significantly associated with the prevalence of VPCs. Among diuretic users at baseline, those with lower serum potassium levels were most likely to have VPCs. Over the follow-up period among nonhypertensive persons the relative risk (SI/UC) for the occurrence of VPCs during follow-up was 0.83, and for hypertensives this relative risk increased linearly from 1.08 to 1.42, with higher levels of diastolic blood pressure at entry (p less than 0.01 for linear trend of relative risk estimates). This was due to an increasing risk among the SI group, and the risk was independent of the presence or absence of rest electrocardiographic abnormalities at baseline. The relative risk estimate, diuretic vs no diuretic, for development of VPCs was approximately 1.2 (p = 0.04) for SI men and 1.1 (p = 0.35) for UC men. The reduction in serum potassium level was greater for those with VPCs, and regression analysis showed that low serum potassium levels were significantly associated with the incidence of VPCs in both study groups. These data confirm and quantify the relation between diuretic drugs and VPCs and suggest that at least 1 mechanism of diuretic-induced VPCs is potassium depletion.\r"

Patients from both groups with early acute illness, before day 5, had a significant reduction in the population of OKT3+ (p less than 0.001), OKT4+ (p less than 0.02) and OKT8+ cells (p less than 0.002), but normal OKT4/OKT8 ratios compared with age-matched control subjects. These abnormal values quickly returned to normal levels during week 2 in patients with normal coronary arteries. In contrast, patients in whom coronary aneurysms developed within 3 weeks of the onset had an imbalance between OKT4 and OKT8 during week 2, characterized by a decrease in the number of OKT8+ cells and an increase in the number of OKT4+ cells, resulting in a high OKT4/OKT8 ratio (p less than 0.01). Three patients in whom large coronary aneurysms developed had ratios higher than 4.50. Follow-up analysis of T-cell subsets from individual patients with coronary aneurysms showed that the OKT4/OKT8 ratio during the acute stage was reduced during the convalescent stage (p less than 0.005). In contrast, the ratio in patients with normal coronary arteries was normal during the course of the illness. These observations suggest that an immune regulatory process operating in coronary aneurysm formation is present.\r"

Twenty-six patients received propranolol, 40 mg, or matching placebo 3 times daily, alone or in combination with ethmozine, 600 to 900 mg/day in 3 equally divided doses, for 1-week periods separated by matching placebo. As determined by 48-hour weekly Holter monitoring, the mean reduction in ventricular premature complex (VPC) frequency was significantly greater with ethmozine (86%) and with ethmozine plus propranolol (90%) than with propranolol (41%) (p less than 0.05). Seventy-five percent of patients had more than a 70% reduction in VPCs with ethmozine plus propranolol, although 70% of patients had an equal degree of suppression with ethmozine alone. Only 2 patients (10%) had the same degree of VPC suppression with propranolol. The results were similar for reductions in pairs of VPCs and VT runs. Two patients discontinued propranolol because of adverse effects, but no patient discontinued ethmozine or combination therapy. Adverse effects were not more frequent with combination therapy. Ventricular function as assessed by echocardiography during drug dosing showed no significant changes from placebo. Ethmozine alone or in combination with propranolol was effective in suppressing VPCs for as long as 1 year in patients who responded. It is concluded that ethmozine alone or in combination with propranolol is well tolerated. Propranolol does not appear to enhance the efficacy of ethmozine.\r"

  ".W": "The relation of body fat distribution to plasma levels of glucose and insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test was examined in 355 Black and White school-age children. Both central and peripheral fat were similarly related to fasting, 30-min, and 1-h glucose. Unlike peripheral fat, central body fat was more strongly related to the 1-h insulin response (r = 0.35 vs 0.26); this association remained significant for central fat independent of peripheral fat (r = 0.18). The strong relation of central fat to insulin response was noted in both races and sexes but not in either sexually immature or relatively thin children. These findings indicate that, even in early life, a central body fat pattern relates positively to insulin response to glucose load. Thus, knowledge of body fat localization may help identify persons most susceptible to hyperinsulinemia in early life.\r"

Serum samples were obtained at fasting time zero and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min postprandial. Mean areas of the glucose curves above fasting decreased with increasing protein dose. Protein-containing meals produced significantly lower (p less than 0.01) areas than the protein-free meal and the relationship between blood glucose area and protein dose was significant (p less than 0.001). Protein-containing meals produced significantly greater (p less than 0.01) insulin areas compared with the protein-free meal. However, no differences in insulin areas among the protein-containing meals were observed. These data support previous studies showing a blood glucose moderating and insulin-enhancing effect of protein ingestion.\r"

If the desirability of frozen section tissue immunophenotyping is anticipated, these lymphomas would be distinguished from PTGC by monotypic staining for light chains.\r"

Tubular epithelial cells of fetal and adult kidney demonstrated a complex pattern of glycosubstances, as detected by staining with most of the lectins. The dysplastic tubules of WIT and WIT heterotransplants resembled distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of adult kidney, as detected by staining with lectins that reacted exclusively with these portions of the nephron. A simpler lectin affinity profile was observed with blastema of normal fetal kidney and blastema of WIT and WIT heterotransplants. Thus, fetal, adult, and tumor tubules and fetal and tumor blastema resemble each other in terms of lectin binding patterns.\r"

Various poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasms, lymphomas, melanomas, and sarcomas were studied with the use of the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technic. All three antibodies had similar staining profiles, however, some differences were noted. The MAK-6 and CAM-5.2 antibodies illustrated stronger staining for some grade III transitional cell carcinomas, whereas the AE1:AE3 was variably positive to negative in all cases. Three renal cell carcinomas were positive with all three antibodies, two were negative with all three, and one had scattered positive cells with MAK-6 only. All lymphomas and plasmacytomas were negative with MAK-6 and CAM-5.2, however, AE1:AE3 faintly stained two of three plasmacytomas and two of the seven large cell lymphomas. Two out of three hepatomas evaluated were strongly positive with CAM-5.2 and MAK-6 and variably positive with AE1:AE3. The third case had both positive and negative cells with all three antibodies. In conclusion, MAK-6 antikeratin antibody is as useful as AE1:AE3 and CAM-5.2 for identification of poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasms.\r"

Beta 2-microglobulin amyloid (AB2M) was found in multiple organs, i.e., bone, subendocardium, gastrointestinal blood vessels, tongue, and carpal tunnel connective tissue. AB2M displayed characteristic amyloid features on conventional light and polarized microscopic examination after congo red staining. However immunostaining with anti-amyloid A protein, kappa, and lambda antisera were negative. The studied material reacted positively with beta 2-microglobulin antisera, identifying AB2M in all three cases. Ultrastructural study revealed an unusual curvi-linear fibrillar configuration. AB2M appears to be a new subtype of systemic amyloidosis secondary to renal failure and long-term hemodialysis.\r"

In 182 subjects with known hematologic disorders, the correct diagnosis was listed first in 134 and second or third in an additional 40. Subjects with iron deficiency, heterozygous thalassemia, immune thrombocytopenia, anemia of chronic disease, reactive thrombocytosis, acute infection, and chronic leukemia had the disorder identified as the most likely one by the analytic program with both sensitivity greater than 80% and specificity greater than 98%. Subjects with acute leukemia, folate deficiency, sickle cell anemia, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and chronic liver disease had the disorder identified as most likely by the program with a sensitivity less than 80%. In a different 11 cases with known hematologic status, a panel of 37 physicians identified the disorder(s) or normality only 72% of the time, whereas the analytic program listed the correct diagnosis first in 10 of 11 (91%).

The authors studied 20 yolk sac tumors and 21 seminomas to investigate the utility of immunohistochemical markers in this differential diagnosis. All yolk sac tumors stained positively for cytokeratin (CK) but so did 43% of seminomas. The CK positivity of yolk sac tumors was generally more diffuse and intense, however, there was an overlap in the spectrum of intensity of CK positivity in yolk sac tumor and seminoma. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was a less sensitive (55%) marker for yolk sac tumor than CK, but AFP was quite specific in this differential diagnosis because no seminoma stained for AFP. Alpha-1-antitrypsin was not a very useful marker because of poor sensitivity and specificity. The interpretation of light microscopic patterns remains of paramount importance in the differentiation of solid yolk sac tumor from seminoma.\r"

Results were compared with those obtained by both conventional viral cultures and histologic examination. CMV was identified by centrifugation culture in 52 (25%) specimens at 16 hours after inoculation, including 39 lung specimens and 12 gastrointestinal specimens. One additional esophageal specimen was positive (53 of 208 specimens; 25.5%) at 36 hours. In contrast, CMV was recovered from only 50 of these 53 specimens by conventional cell culture at a mean of 11 days after inoculation. Forty-three of the 208 specimens (20.5%) were positive for CMV when examined by histologic methods, including light microscopy and tissue immunofluorescence. All 43 were positive by centrifugation culture. Specimens that were positive by centrifugation culture but negative by histologic methods included three lung specimens and seven gastrointestinal specimens. The technic of centrifugation culture is more sensitive for diagnosis of invasive CMV infection by the examination of affected tissue than either conventional viral culture or histologic technics, including tissue immunofluorescence, and more rapid than conventional culture or routine histologic examination.\r"

With increased life span due to kidney transplantation, ten to 25 years of cystine accumulation has resulted in pancreatic complications in individuals with cystinosis. We noted severe hyperglycemia in five posttransplant patients, three of whom remained insulin-dependent diabetics several years after transplant. The clinical findings were not consistent with steroid-dependent or insulin-resistant diabetes. Pancreatic cystine deposition was detected histologically and biochemically on post-mortem examination of two other patients. We conclude that hyperglycemia may be anticipated in the immediate posttransplant period in cystinotic patients and that some patients will require insulin therapy years later. The use of cystine-depleting agents should be considered in posttransplant cystinosis as an attempt to prevent potential damage to the pancreas and other organs from cystine deposition.\r"

The DSS, as administered by us, significantly overestimated gestational age compared with the standard gestational age (mean +/- 1 SD: 34.2 +/- 2.9 vs 32.5 +/- 3.9 weeks, respectively) in preterm infants. To illustrate, the gestational ages of 13 newborns (52%) in the total study group were each overestimated by more than two weeks. This percentage increased to 75% among the 16 infants whose gestational ages were less than 34 weeks (by standard gestational age). When the standard gestational age was underestimated by the DSS, this difference never exceeded two weeks. These findings suggest that the present system of postnatal assessment of gestational age in preterm infants needs further investigation.\r"

Additional studies revealed hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (serum values: sodium ion, 139 mmol/L [139 mEq/L]; chloride, 113 mmol/L [113 mEq/L]; bicarbonate, 18 mmol/L [18 mEq/L]), a normal glomerular filtration rate, a subnormal renal threshold for bicarbonate reabsorption, and normal serum thyroxine, growth hormone, and cortisol values. Renal excretion of potassium ion was subnormal for the prevailing serum concentration of potassium ion but was increased normally by infusion of sodium sulfate. The serum aldosterone concentration was appropriate for a normokalemic subject, despite marked suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) (supine/upright: aldosterone, 140/580 pmol/L [5/21 ng/dL]; PRA, 0.0/0.03 ng/L X s [0.0/0.1 ng/mL/h]). Treatment with chlorothiazide and sodium chloride resulted in correction of the abnormal electrolyte concentrations and an increase in linear growth velocity. Serum aldosterone concentrations did not change significantly during treatment, even though the PRA had increased (supine/upright: aldosterone, 110/920 pmol/L [4/33 ng/dL]; PRA, 0.89/2.17 ng/L X s [3.2/7.8 ng/mL/h]). In this patient, we conclude that (1) hyperkalemia was due to inadequate renal excretion of potassium ion; (2) the serum potassium ion concentration was the major stimulus to aldosterone secretion before treatment; (3) suppression of PRA was more likely due to hyperkalemia than to extracellular volume expansion.\r"

In infused patients there was improvement in bilirubin (p = 0.001), AST (p = 0.008), and serum albumin (p = 0.016). Improvement in functional mass by galactose elimination capacity was significant at the p = 0.052 level. Hyaline was initially present in six of eight pairs of biopsies in both groups. After treatment, five of six pairs in controls but only one of six pairs in the infused group still had hyaline (p = 0.03). This latter finding, if confirmed in larger groups, may be of considerable clinical importance. It is suggested that 3- to 4-wk trials of such protocols may require a longer duration of follow-up in greater numbers of patients to detect important advantages of amino acid-glucose infusions which are only implicit in these findings.\r"

  ".W": "Modern views of the pathogenesis and natural history of nephrotic syndrome have changed substantially since the early studies by Cotugno and Bright. Contrary to beliefs held 20 years ago, we do not possess a unique satisfying explanation for the induction, maintenance, and resolution of nephrotic edema, and many concepts firmly established as \"classic\" are now being revised or reconsidered. These include the relationship between urinary protein losses and hypoalbuminemia, which is complicated by several factors such as daily protein intake, albumin catabolism, and the possible role of albumin loss at extrarenal sites. The influence of lowered plasma albumin on the decrease in plasma volume is also quite complex, due to technical difficulties in measuring plasma volume and turnover of radio-labeled albumin. The most contentious areas are how sodium and water retention are initiated and maintained and the relationship between hypoalbuminemia, plasma oncotic pressure, and edema. While aldosterone excretion and plasma concentrations are elevated in nephrotic patients, data on the renin-angiotensin system are controversial and the renal handling of sodium is related to a host of factors including glomerular filtration rate, altered proximal tubular reabsorption, and the role of vasodilators or vasoconstrictors. The complications of nephrotic syndrome are protean and relatively common. Among those are acute renal failure, thrombosis, infections, and hyperlipidemia. Since the introduction of percutaneous biopsy, the spectrum of lesions underlying nephrotic syndrome has widened considerably, the most common being minimal change, especially in children. There are very few prognostic indicators by which response to treatment may be predicted and these include persistent microscopic hematuria.\r"

  ".W": "This review deals with various immunopathogenetic mechanisms of renal diseases. Although immune-complex nephritis was long thought to be the result of deposition of circulating immune complexes, recent studies have revealed the importance of in situ formation. In experimental Heymann nephritis, an antigen (gp 330) has been localized on glomerular epithelial cells, and antibodies reactive with gp 330 have been eluted from glomeruli; deposits appear to result from shedding of complexes from the podocyte surface into the basement membrane. In human disease, it seems likely that mesangial and subendothelial deposits most often result from deposition of circulating immune complexes, whereas subepithelial deposits are formed mainly in situ. Cell-mediated immune mechanisms are capable of producing glomerular injury, as shown in experimental models. In humans, Wegener's granulomatosis and idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis may involve such mechanisms. In certain forms of experimental and human tubulointerstitial nephritis, cell-mediated immunity also seems to play an important role.\r"

The study of recurrent GN is considered of great interest because of the possible insight into the nature of the original disease and the opportunity to observe the evolution of the disease in sequential biopsies of the transplant. The two major forms of de novo GN were membranous GN and IgG linear deposits along glomerular and tubular basement membranes. Transplant glomerulopathy, although distinctive morphologically, may resemble membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) or thrombotic microangiopathy.\r"

Antithrombotic therapy for these conditions included intravenous and oral anticoagulants and later antiplatelet agents, all of which remain in use today. Subsequent research sought a thrombolytic agent that could lyse a clot directly. Intravenously administered streptokinase and urokinase were found to act on the inactive proenzyme plasminogen to produce the active enzyme plasmin that could safely and effectively lyse fresh fibrin clots. These agents have proved effective for the treatment of myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism, as well as peripheral arterial and venous thromboembolic conditions. Recent efforts have been directed toward a search for clot-specific agents that would avoid the systemic lytic state associated with the use of urokinase and streptokinase. Three clot-specific plasminogen activators are currently being evaluated: recombinant tissue-specific plasminogen activator, anisoylated streptokinase plasminogen activator complex, and pro-urokinase.\r"

From 1983 to 1986, there were five major trials of these agents in acute myocardial infarction: the Western Washington Intracoronary Streptokinase Trial, the Dutch Interuniversity Group Trial, the Italian Group for the Study of Streptokinase in Myocardial Infarction Trial, the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial, and the Intravenous Streptokinase in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial. This review considers each of these randomized, prospective trials in terms of design, mean time to therapy, lysis rate, reocclusion and in-hospital reinfarction, bleeding complications, in-hospital mortality, late survival, left ventricular function, and post-infarction morbidity. Findings from these trials indicate that thrombolytic therapy, if given less than four to six hours after onset of symptoms, improves the mortality rate and reduces post-infarction morbidity. Bleeding, a major cause of morbidity, can be managed by careful patient selection and clinical observation.\r"

  ".U": "87323284\r", 
  ".W": "This study examines the effect of glipizide therapy in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) previously treated with a low-dose insulin regimen. To determine the comparative safety and efficacy of these two treatment regimens, 135 patients with NIDDM who received low-dose insulin (40 units per day or less) were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter trial. After a four-week period of continued insulin therapy, therapy was converted to the second-generation oral sulfonylurea, glipizide. This report includes efficacy data on 79 patients with NIDDM who completed an eight- to 10-week course of glipizide therapy. A majority of these patients were obese (more than 120 percent of ideal body weight), with a mean age of 61.4 years, and a mean duration of diabetes of 10.0 years. Conversion from low-dose insulin resulted in no deterioration in overall glycemic control as reflected by an unchanged glycosylated hemoglobin at 16 weeks. Seventy patients (89 percent) attained fair glucose control and continued an additional 12 weeks of glipizide maintenance therapy. Subgroup analysis by fasting plasma glucose criteria demonstrated that 44 percent of these patients had statistically significant improvements in glucose control with glipizide as compared with insulin therapy. As this study showed, many patients with NIDDM currently receiving treatment with low-dose insulin can have maintained and some even improved glucose and lipid parameters when therapy is converted to glipizide. The rate of hypoglycemic adverse reactions corrected for duration of treatment in all 135 patients was 0.32 event per patient-month of therapy with insulin as compared with 0.12 event per patient-month of therapy with glipizide. When issues of efficacy, safety, and convenience are considered, it might be more appropriate to administer an oral sulfonylurea to patients with NIDDM rather than proceeding to therapy with insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of glipizide alone and glipizide preceded by a short course of insulin therapy (10 weeks) was studied in 69 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in a 10-month study. The patients were obese, had poor glycemic control, and, in all patients, first-generation sulfonylurea therapy had failed. The majority were Mexican-Americans, an ethnic population with a high incidence of NIDDM and insulin resistance. Plasma glucose levels were monitored using the eight-point [Saarstedt] series. In the group receiving glipizide alone, mean fasting plasma glucose levels decreased from 255.9 mg/dl at baseline to 228.7 mg/dl at the end of the study; two-hour postprandial glucose levels decreased from 280.1 to 260.5 mg/dl; glycosylated hemoglobin decreased from 9.1 to 7.4 percent; and post-Sustacal C-peptide levels increased from 0.7 to 1.0 pmol/ml. In the group receiving insulin/glipizide, mean fasting plasma glucose levels decreased from 241.1 mg/dl at baseline to 217.0 mg/dl; two-hour postprandial glucose levels increased from 267.2 to 279.0 mg/dl; glycosylated hemoglobin decreased from 9.1 to 7.5 percent; and post-Sustacal C-peptide levels increased from 0.6 to 1.0 pmol/ml. At the end of 10 weeks, insulin administration was associated with a more rapid decrease in the levels of fasting plasma glucose, two-hour postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin, but there was no significant difference between the two therapies by the end of the study. Both regimens had a positive influence on reducing the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio. More patients in the group receiving insulin/glipizide withdrew from the study, which may have been due to difficulties associated with insulin administration. In conclusion, there does not appear to be a prolonged effect of insulin treatment on the post-receptor defect. Some patients in whom first-generation oral agents fail may not have to be given permanent insulin therapy, especially those with fasting plasma glucose levels of less than 200 mg/dl. There was no overall difference between these treatments with respect to glycemic control or lipoprotein profiles. In the interests of simplifying both therapy and monitoring, enhancing patient compliance, and achieving cost reductions, therapy with glipizide alone ultimately may be sufficient for cases in which immediate control is unnecessary (for example, patients with asymptomatic hyperglycemia, and in the absence of hyperlipidemia and vascular disease).\r"

Its consequences include microvascular and macrovascular disease, both of which appear to evolve from a common background of obesity and physical inactivity. The current study was undertaken in obese patients with NIDDM to see whether improvements could be made in glycemic control as well as in many cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, and physical inactivity) that are typical of this condition. Fifteen obese insulin-using patients with NIDDM (average body mass index, 34.0) were treated with a 500-calorie formula diet for eight to 12 weeks. Administration of insulin and diuretics was discontinued at the onset of the study. A eucaloric diet was begun at eight to 12 weeks and maintained until Week 24. A behaviorally oriented nutrition-exercise program was instituted at the beginning of the study. Glipizide or placebo was added (randomized) at Week 15 if the fasting plasma glucose level in patients exceeded 115 mg/dl. Patients lost an average of 22 pounds over the course of 24 weeks. Frequency and duration of physical activity increased significantly from baseline, as did the maximal oxygen consumption rate. Glycemic control by 15 weeks (without insulin) was similar to baseline (with insulin). With the addition of glipizide at Week 15, both fasting plasma glucose and glucose tolerance improved significantly. This improvement was not observed with placebo. In addition, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by about 10 mm Hg. There were no significant changes in the levels of serum lipids or glycosylated hemoglobin. In conclusion, a multifaceted intervention program, employing weight reduction, exercise, diet, and glipizide therapy, can be instituted in insulin-using patients with NIDDM, with improvement in glycemic control and in certain risk factors (hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity) for cardiovascular disease.\r"

The risk for developing IDDM is associated closely with the presence of the HLA type DR3 and/or DR4. The risk is greatest for those with both DR3 and DR4. Recent evidence indicates that the DR antigens are only expressed in the beta cells of individuals who are developing IDDM. Activation of the DR antigen in beta cells apparently plays a role in the pathogenesis of IDDM. A process that turns off the expression of the DR antigen may stop the destruction of the beta cells. Preliminary evidence indicates that total suppression of beta cell function with an artificial pancreas (Biostator) significantly prolongs beta cell function well beyond that reported for immunosuppressive drugs. The Biostator may work by total suppression of beta cell function, which turns off the expression of the DR antigen with a resultant cessation of beta cell destruction.\r"

Almost simultaneously, marrow from an MHC-matched donor corrected the immunological deficiency of a patient with Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS). In the first successful treatment of X-linked SCID the match was imperfect and, although SCID was cured, a graft vs. host reaction caused pancytopenia. A second BMT from the same donor successfully treated a complicating aplastic anemia. Subsequently, it has been possible to cure most patients with SCID who are in reasonably good condition at the time of BMT without other manipulation if a matched sibling donor is available. Successes are reported from Holland, France, Italy, England, Scandinavia, Japan, Germany, and from many centers in the United States. Similarly, BMT is used to correct SCID due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency or nucleoside phosphorylase (NP) deficiency, which underlie two forms of SCID. Bone marrow transplantation using HLA-matched sibling donors can now treat, successfully, at least eight genetically separable forms of SCID. Highly lethal defects of phagocytic function (including LFA-1, MO-1, CR-3 deficiencies, IL-2 and IL-1 receptor deficiencies), defects of killing after phagocytosis (as in chronic granulomatous disease, WAS, and Kostmann's Syndrome), and certain inborn errors of metabolism can be cured by BMT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The propositus underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a normal histocompatible sibling. Two and a half years later, the propositus has not developed the intellectual and neurologic impairment demonstrated by the first sibling, although nerve conduction has continued to worsen. These results suggest that the induction of normal enzyme levels by BMT may be retarding or inhibiting CNS deterioration. These results, confirming earlier results of others, are sufficiently promising to warrant a larger scale critical trial of BMT early in the course of MLD.\r"

However, clinical and laboratory parameters were either too insensitive or too nonspecific to be useful in identifying most cases of shigellosis or in excluding the likelihood of its presence. Patients with mild clinical presentations, regardless of etiology, experienced resolution of disease sooner than those with moderate to severe presentations (p less than 0.01), but withholding therapy from patients with mild presentations resulted in 48% of these patients remaining ill at the end of 48 hours. Based on these findings, the authors advise empiric use of antimicrobial agents in travelers with diarrhea associated with fever, bloody stools, or fecal leukocytes, and for all travelers with moderate and severe diarrhea. If therapy is withheld from patients with initially mild presentations, a proportion might still require therapy, possibly an antimicrobial agent, for optimal control of symptoms.\r"

With the use of the standard definition of febrile morbidity (temperature of greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F during any two 24-hour periods after the first postoperative 24 hours) the postoperative morbidity rate was 15% during 1967 to 1973, 5.4% during 1974 to 1979, and 0.7% during the period 1980 through 1986.

Multiple biometric parameters were obtained, including the transverse cerebellar diameter by use of the electronic calipers of the machine. A prenatal diagnosis of intrauterine growth retardation was made in all cases based on: (1) the transverse cerebellar diameter being consistently correlated with gestational age as predicted by the last menstrual period, whereas most of the other measurements were consistently discrepant with the transverse cerebellar diameter by more than 2.5 weeks (i.e., more than 2 SD above the mean), and (2) the estimated fetal weight of all fetuses being equal to or less than the tenth percentile for gestational age. Neonatal examination confirmed all fetuses to be growth retarded with birth weights at or below the tenth percentile for gestational age. These findings indicate that growth of the transverse cerebellar diameter is unaffected by intrauterine growth retardation; thus this sonographic measurement may serve as an independent and reliable correlate of gestational age against which potential deviations of growth may be compared.\r"

The predictive accuracy of a 30- to 33-week abdominal circumference measurement was tested, using the ninetieth percentile as the discriminant point. The study consisted of 201 patients with gestational diabetes who maintained weekly fasting glucose levels less than 100 mg/dl and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels less than 120 mg/dl with dietary management alone. The predictive accuracy of a 30- to 33-week fetal abdominal circumference measurement was 96.4% for ruling out macrosomia and 56.3% for predicting macrosomia. Patients with fetal abdominal circumference measurements greater than the ninetieth percentile at 30 to 33 weeks had a significantly increased incidence of cesarean section for failure to progress, shoulder dystocia, and birth trauma, whereas patients with abdominal circumference measurements less than or equal to the ninetieth percentile were at no greater risk than the general population. These results suggest that patients with non-insulin-dependent gestational diabetes with fetal abdominal circumference measurements less than or equal to the ninetieth percentile at 30 to 33 weeks are not at increased risk for macrosomia, cesarean section, or birth trauma at term, as long as their weekly glucose testing remains within normal limits. Efforts to decrease the incidence of macrosomia and its attendant risks should focus on those gestational diabetic patients whose fetal abdominal circumference greater than the ninetieth percentile at 30 to 33 weeks.\r"

To test the hypothesis that diminished cord Wharton's jelly incurs risk of peripartum cord compression in addition to decreased amniotic fluid, 68 patients with confirmed gestational age greater than or equal to 41 weeks were evaluated prospectively with semiweekly nonstress tests and weekly ultrasound examinations. Amniotic fluid volume was assessed, and umbilical cord diameter was measured and then correlated with the quantity of Wharton's jelly at delivery, determined by cord circumference. A significant correlation between cord circumference and umbilical cord diameter was observed, even in those patients with decreased amniotic fluid volume. Either an amniotic fluid volume less than 3.8 cm or an umbilical cord diameter less than 1.6 cm was associated with significant cord compression patterns. Peripartum morbidity was greatest in the presence of a smaller cord and decreased fluid, suggesting a synergism between these two factors for the risk of cord compression in prolonged pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "The presence or absence of fetal breathing movements may be helpful in differentiating between true and false preterm labor. We attempted to demonstrate the clinical utility of this simple ultrasonic observation in predicting short-term delivery outcome during suspected preterm labor. A total of 50 pregnancies between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation with presumed preterm labor were observed in a prospective manner. During 20 minutes of observation with real-time ultrasound at the time of admission, fetal breathing movements were observed in 33 patients and considered absent in the remaining 17 patients. In those pregnancies with absent fetal breathing movements, true labor with subsequent delivery occurred in 16 patients. Of the 33 pregnancies with fetal breathing movements present, 29 continued for greater than 48 hours. It appears that the absence of fetal breathing movement is a reliable indicator of imminent preterm delivery, irrespective of fetal membrane status (p less than 0.0001). The observed mean sensitivity and specificity of this phenomenon in predicting short-term delivery outcome are 96.6% +/- 3.3% (mean +/- SD) and 80.0% +/- 8.9%, respectively. A multivariant statistical model based on the frequency of contractions, white blood cell counts, initial cervical examination results, and premature rupture of membranes could successfully predict delivery outcome in 40% to 75% of cases. The addition of fetal breathing movement analysis to the model allowed for the correct prediction of outcome in 90% of the cases.\r"

The ratio calculated by comparing the fetal thoracic circumference to abdominal circumference was obtained in all cases within 10 days of delivery. This ratio correlated strongly with neonatal outcome. Multivariate regression models of neonatal outcome were developed to analyze the relationship of gestational age at which premature membrane rupture occurred, the duration of premature rupture, date of birth, and prenatal diagnosis. The addition of the thoracic circumference to the abdominal circumference ratio increased significantly the proportion of explained variability. Application of this ratio should be considered in evaluating fetal status in oligohydramnios and in the expectant management of premature rupture of membranes.\r"

We examined Group B Streptococcus growth in aseptically obtained amniotic fluid in vitro after altering its zinc, phosphorus, and meconium contents. Zinc and phosphorus levels were calculated in amniotic fluid and in meconium. Separate solutions of zinc and phosphorus were added to yield concentrations of 0.7, 7.0, 70, and 700 mumol. The solutions were incubated with Group B Streptococcus III 893 and Escherichia coli C5 strains, and 24-hour growth curves were plotted. Meconium, 0.5 mg/ml, was added to each amniotic fluid + zinc and amniotic fluid + phosphorus solution, and growth curves were plotted. The rate of proliferation of Group B Streptococcus varied directly with the zinc concentration (700 = 70 greater than 7 greater than 0.7 mumol) and inversely with the phosphorus content (700 less than 70 less than 7 = 0.7 mumol). Meconium enhanced the proliferative effect of zinc and hindered the inhibitory effect of phosphorus. Thus one possible mechanism whereby meconium enhances bacterial growth in amniotic fluid may be by alteration of zinc-to-phosphorus ratios.\r"

The medians of the growth fractions of the tumor cells in all histologic subtypes of Hodgkin's disease varied between 78% and 83%. In none of the cases investigated did we find a growth fraction below 50%. Furthermore, mononucleated Hodgkin cells as well as multi-nucleated Reed-Sternberg cells showed a similar Ki-67 labeling index, indicating that both tumor cell types belong to the proliferating pool of this malignancy.\r"

In all cases a large number of cells (mean, 58.75%; range, 35-80%), recognized as thymocytes by morphology and lack of cytokeratin expression in a combined immunohistochemical assay, exhibited nuclear Ki67 staining. These findings differ from the reactivity pattern observed in age-matched nonneoplastic thymuses where lower growth activity of cortical thymocytes was observed (15-20% Ki67+ cells). Intensive thymocyte proliferation in thymomas may represent one of the factors which lead to autoimmunity in myasthenia gravis and thymomas.\r"

Phenotypic and functional subsets of circulating monocytes have been described, but few similar studies have analyzed M phi s in human tissues. By use of immunohistochemical techniques and a large number of monoclonal antibodies, the presence and distribution of phenotypic subpopulations of M phi s and dendritic cells in human spleen were assessed. The results of this study show that different subsets of M phi s and dendritic cells are present in the spleen and that some of these occupy discrete microanatomic locations. In the red pulp (RP) certain groups of antigens are expressed by different proportions of uniformly distributed M phi s in the cords. On the other hand, some antigens are present on M phi s that form clusters of variable size within the red pulp. M phi s in the splenic marginal zone (MZ) share some antigens with red pulp M phi s, but in addition express CR3, Mo-2, 61D3, and 63D3. These antigens are found on only a few RP M phi s. MZ cells expressing one antigen shared with RP M phi s (Leu-3a,b) and one present largely on the MZ cells (63D3) form clusters around small vessels; these structures resemble the so-called splenic ellipsoids that may play a role in the trapping of circulating antigens. Phagocytic M phi s (tingible body M phi s) of the white pulp follicular germinal centers were also shown to differ from RP and MZ cels with respect to the expression of the antigens detected by anti-FcR, Leu-M3, Mo-2, 25F9, and anti-CR3. The unique topographical and surface antigenic features of dendritic cells were confirmed by this study. Furthermore, these cells were found to share a number of antigens with RP, MZ, and white pulp M phi s, which suggests that they may be derived from a common progenitor. The presence of phenotypic subpopulations and variation in distribution among human splenic phagocytic cells and dendritic cells may be indicative of functional specialization.\r"

By indirect immunoperoxidase in frozen tissue sections, FU3 and FU4 revealed strong staining of perivascular mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts. In the spleen FU3 stained perivascular cells of the ellipsoids and the marginal zone of the lymph follicles. Macrophages in granulation tissues as well as monocytes and other blood cells in normal peripheral blood were uniformly negative for the antigen detected by FU3. Among various soft-tissue tumors, MFH and liposarcoma reacted strongly with FU3 and FU4, but synovial sarcoma revealed no reaction with either of the antibodies. Immunoelectron-microscopic studies demonstrated positive reactions with FU3 and FU4 on the surface of MFH cell membrane, which suggests that these antibodies recognized cell surface antigens. In conclusion, MFH shares antigenicity with perivascular mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts as well as liposarcoma. MFH and liposarcoma may have a common origin from the perivascular mesenchymal cells that are supposed to have a potential for multidirectional differentiation.\r"

Reticuloendothelial siderosis was absent, as occurs in primary hemochromatosis. Studies of iron metabolism were performed antemortem in two of the siblings and ante-, post- and internatally in their mother, who showed hyperferremia antenatally. The only finding in the affected family suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis was the commonly associated HLA haplotype (A3, B7) in the mother and an infant. Liver morphology, including immunocytochemistry and ultrastructure, was similar in the 5 infants and suggested that liver disease commenced as massive necrosis in midfetal life. Histologic grading and chemical assays for iron and copper on liver and spleen of the 5 index cases were compared with 26 controls; placentas were compared with 12 control placentas. Hepatic iron concentration, but not hepatic copper concentration, was significantly increased in index cases, compared with controls. Hepatic iron to copper ratio was significantly increased in index cases, compared with controls, but this ratio was unaltered in spleen and placenta. Total hepatic iron, but not total hepatic copper, was significantly increased in index cases, compared with a subgroup of 11 controls of low gestational age, similar to the fetal stage when liver disease commenced in utero. The results suggest that, irrespective of the fetal liver disease being genetic or acquired, hepatic iron overload was directly involved in pathogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "87323488\r", 
  ".W": "Dunning R3327-H rat prostate adenocarcinoma cells, when grown in syngeneic (Copenhagen) rats or nude mice, produce tumors with prominent hypercellular stroma. The authors have previously demonstrated the presence of anomalous steroid-sensitive cells in both the epithelium and stromal compartments of this model system. In order to better understand the histogenesis of these cells, the authors studied samples of the tumor which were radiolabeled overnight with tritiated dihydrotestosterone (3H-DHT). Frozen sections of the tissues were thaw-mounted onto autoradiographic emulsion-coated slides to permit silver grain identification in association with nuclei of androgen-sensitive cells. Surprisingly, numerous silver grains were found to be associated with nuclei of large cells within the stroma. Therefore, these cells were termed \"epithelioid\" pending confirmation of their origin. To further define these cells and their relationship to the surrounding matrix, autoradiograms have now been examined immunohistochemically with antibodies directed against the basement membrane glycoprotein, laminin, as well as antibodies specific for intermediate cytoskeletal filaments. Following identification of acinar basement membranes, epithelioid cells were identifiable both in the stroma and in the acinar epithelial cell layer. Histochemical staining with acid phosphatase, a marker for prostatic epithelium, was performed and shown to be present in acinar epithelial cells as well as in epithelioid cells. Additionally, fluorescence-activated cell sorting was employed to characterize the DNA content of cell types within the H tumor. Epithelioid cells were found to be in highest concentration in an aneuploid peak with a ploidy of approximately 6N. The autoradiographic, immunohistochemical, cytometric, and ultramicroscopic studies suggest that 1) epithelioid cells are epithelial derived stromal cells; 2) these epithelioid cells arise by pathologic division of aneuploid neoplastic precursor cells of approximately 3N ploidy, which are found within the prostatic epithelium; and 3) the resulting 6N cells degrade the basement membrane locally, invade the stroma, and populate it. Here, they can be distinguished from fibroblasts by their size, acid phosphatase activity, and hormone receptor content. Thus, the term \"epithelioid\" is inappropriate; and these cells should be regarded simply as large neoplastic epithelial (LNE) cells. The presence of this cell type suggests that this tumor subline represents a useful naturally occurring model for the study of the initial stages of neoplastic transformation.\r"

The present study was designed to compare the glandular and stromal elements of the relapse phase with the histologically distinct early and intermediate phases of tumor progression. Morphometric analysis revealed significant differences between all three groups in the percentages of total tumor occupied by the epithelial component. At all three time periods, high-power inspection of autoradiograms prepared after incubation of the tissues with radioactive dihydrotestosterone revealed large cells in the stroma, especially in the intermediate phase. Immunohistochemistry further revealed evidence of invasion across the prostatic acinar basement membranes by similar cells. These studies lead the authors to postulate a mechanism by which hormone-independent cells in the epithelium repopulate the stroma, causing a recapitulation of the original morphology of the tumor in the postremission period. They propose that prostate tumor response to estrogen therapy can be operationally defined in three phases: involution, rebound, and relapse. They infer that further knowledge of the timing of these phases may permit early selective use of specific therapeutic strategies which will be able to balance the clinical risk with the known behavior of the neoplasm during progression of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "In 15 cases of Hodgkin's disease, the authors studied the DNA content of isolated nuclei from deparaffinized tissue by using multiparameter flow cytometry. An antinucleolar antibody preparation was employed as well as a secondary antibody that had been conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. By simultaneously quantitating nucleolar fluorescence and DNA content, rare but distinct aneuploid populations were detected among the nuclei with brightly stained nucleoli. DNA aneuploidy was found in each case when this multiparameter analysis was used, but was detected in only 1 case when DNA content was analyzed alone. With the multiparameter analysis, two to four aneuploid populations were found in each case. These populations exhibited incremental duplications of DNA content that suggested endopolyploidy, ie, replication of DNA without accompanying nuclear division. The aneuploid stem line was hypodiploid or hypotetraploid in 6 cases, hyperdiploid in 7 cases, and near-triploid in 2 cases. These various abnormalities in ploidy showed only some correlation with histologic subtypes. Cell sorting showed that some nuclei with more than four or nearly eight times normal DNA content resembled nuclei of typical Reed-Sternberg cells. Many nuclei with an intermediate aneuploid DNA content resembled nuclei of mononuclear Reed-Sternberg cells. The near-diploid and near-triploid nuclei corresponded to nuclei of cells which were not readily recognizable as neoplastic in histologic sections. It is concluded that multiparameter analysis of DNA content can provide further insights into the neoplastic cells in Hodgkin's disease and may offer an objective basis for studying heterogeneity in this disorder.\r"

The Indian child understands the environment through intuitive, visual, and pictorial means, but success in the Anglo school is largely dependent on auditory processing, abstract conceptualization, and language skills. This difference compounds existing problems of poverty, dislocation, alienation, depression and intergenerational conflict and can partially account for the higher rate of emotional and behavioral problems among Indian adolescents.\r"

These nine cases involved four polytetrafluoroethylene and five Dacron grafts. There were five graft thromboses, one instance of limb loss, two graft infections, two deaths, and 13 separate surgical procedures related to the perigraft seroma. Histologic studies revealed a fibrous pseudomembrane lining the perigraft seroma wall and immature fibroblasts lining the graft. Sera from three patients with perigraft seroma, five patients with well-incorporated prosthetic grafts, and three healthy volunteer subjects were tested for in vitro evidence of fibroblast inhibition against fibroblast tissue cultures derived from the pseudomembrane of a perigraft seroma. Control fetal calf serum, sera from all three healthy subjects, and sera from all five patients with well-incorporated grafts allowed fibroblast proliferation. In contrast, sera from all three patients with perigraft seroma inhibited fibroblast growth. Furthermore, sera collected 1, 2, and 3 months after graft removal from one patient and serum collected 3 months after spontaneous resolution of a perigraft seroma from another patient failed to inhibit fibroblasts. We have concluded that patients with perigraft seroma have a high rate of graft and limb loss and require multiple reoperations. The pathogenesis of perigraft seroma appears to involve a humoral fibroblast inhibitor which prevents maturation and proliferation of perigraft fibroblasts, leading to poor graft incorporation. The decrease of inhibition below detectable levels after graft removal or spontaneous resolution of the perigraft seroma suggests that the graft may induce host production of the inhibitor. Effective therapy of perigraft seroma may include fibroblast modulation, removal of the inciting graft, or both.\r"

Ascending contrast venography was performed in 15 postphlebitic limbs for assessment of valve location.

The short saphenous vein was harvested for a free vein graft in 31 patients. In the remaining five patients, the short saphenous vein was used in situ for popliteal-to-distal artery bypass. In four patients, the distal anastomosis was performed to the distal anterior tibial artery and in one patient, to the distal posterior tibial artery. Valves were excised with valvulotomes and deep fistulas were easily ligated. A medial incision for vein exposure was the preferred approach. We suggest that the short saphenous vein be considered more often for use as an arterial bypass conduit when the greater saphenous vein is not available, before submitting to nonautogenous bypass or primary amputation.\r"

  ".U": "87323791\r", 
  ".W": "Measurement of pleural fluid pH has diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic implications in exudative pleural effusions (Table II). A parapneumonic effusion with a pleural fluid pH below 7.2 indicates an empyema is forming which necessitates chest tube drainage in all patients, whereas a pleural fluid pH over 7.3 does not require drainage. If the pH of a parapneumonic effusion is 7.2 to 7.3, serial pleural fluid pH measurements with clinical observation will help to determine the need for chest tube drainage. A pleural fluid glucose level of below 60 mg/dl and a lactic dehydrogenase level over 1,000 IU/dl in conjunction with a pleural fluid pH of 7.2 to 7.3 indicate an impending empyema. These findings are consistent with our clinical experience in patients with parapneumonic effusion. Tuberculous pleural effusions had a pleural fluid pH below 7.4 in all reported patients. This pH may be of value in distinguishing tuberculous pleural effusions from recent malignant effusions, which tend to have a higher pleural fluid pH, particularly if used in conjunction with other pleural fluid values, cell counts, and other clinical parameters. In patients with malignant pleural effusions, a pH of less than 7.3 is usually seen in those effusions present for several months and is associated with a lower glucose level and a higher white cell count and lactic dehydrogenase level. Results of cytologic study of the pleural fluid and pleural biopsy are often positive, there is poor response to sclerosing agents, and the prognosis is poor. A rheumatoid pleural effusion most often has a pleural fluid pH below 7.3. A pleural fluid pH below 6 is seen almost exclusively in esophageal rupture but rarely with empyemas, whereas a pleural fluid pH below 7 occurs in esophageal rupture, empyema, and rheumatoid pleural effusions. In pleural effusions secondary to congestive heart failure, the pH is almost always greater than 7.4 unless systemic acidemia coexists, in which case the pleural fluid pH is within 0.04 units of the simultaneous arterial pH. The major value of pleural fluid pH is to determine the need for chest tube drainage in parapneumonic effusions and to determine the response to sclerosing agents in patients with malignant pleural effusions. As with all diagnostic tests, the results should be interpreted in the context of other diagnostic tests of the pleural fluid and clinical aspects before diagnostic or therapeutic decisions are made.\r"

The ADH-independent pathway of ethanol metabolism by neural cells appeared to be dependent on one or more isoenzymes of cytochrome P-450. The data emphasize the possibility that the neurotoxicity of ethanol may be related to a relatively high ethanol-metabolizing capability of neural tissue and particularly of neuroglial cells.\r"

The consumptions during the treatment period were compared to those of the preceding one (basic). Decrease of ethanol and solid food intake and increase of that of water in UChB rats and only a decrease of solid food intake in UChA rats were observed. These effects cannot be ascribed to blocking of dopaminergic or noradrenergic synapses, since this dose of AMPT inhibits the in vivo synthesis of both catecholamines.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated whether female offspring of alcohol-treated mothers are, themselves, more or less susceptible than control offspring to the deleterious effects of alcohol on the outcome of their own pregnancy. One group of pregnant C57BL mice was fed a liquid diet containing 25% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) and another group was pair-fed an isocaloric (0% EDC) control diet. A third group was fed lab chow ad libitum (LC). The female offspring resulting from those matings were subsequently mated upon reaching 90 days of age. These pregnant mice were then separated into three prenatal treatments (25% EDC, 0% EDC, and LC). On gestation-day 19, second generation fetuses were removed by cesarean section, weighed, and sexed. Results indicated that number of implants, live births, and percent prenatal mortality did not differ between groups. However, fetal weight was lower in groups prenatally exposed to ethanol than in controls, regardless of the prenatal history of the mothers, themselves. More importantly, the data suggest that offspring of alcohol-treated mothers who do not consume alcohol themselves during their own pregnancy may still have a tendency to have offspring of lower birth weight. On the other hand, if mothers prenatally exposed to alcohol do consume alcohol during their own pregnancy, the impact of fetal weight suppression is even greater than expected for in utero alcohol exposure alone. These effects may be due to the fact that mothers who were prenatally exposed to alcohol weighed less than controls at the time of becoming pregnant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subjects were to respond whether a target letter was present at the global or at the local level. In the Neutral Bias condition target letters occurred randomly and equally often at the global and local levels. In the Global Bias condition, 79% of the targets occurred at the global and 21% at the local level. In the Local Bias condition, 79% of the targets occurred at the local and 21% at the global level. Subjects indicated by pressing a key which of two target letters had appeared on that trial. Subjects received either a placebo drink, a drink containing 0.7 ml of Alcohol per kg body weight, or a drink containing 1 ml of Alcohol per kg body weight. Placebo subjects were better at detecting letters at the global than at the local level in the Global Bias condition, better at local than global in the Local Bias condition, and about equally good at both levels in the Neutral Bias condition. Alcohol had no effect on detection of letters at the local level in any of the bias conditions but reduced detection of letters at the global level except when subjects were biased globally. The data suggest that alcohol does not affect attentional capacity. Instead, alcohol seems to affect either how attentional capacity is allocated or the global processing mechanism itself.\r"

In 10 alcoholic liver disease outpatients attending clinic in whom plasma ethanol concentrations ranged from 32-304 mg/dl, the correlation of plasma ethanol determined directly by gas chromatography and indirectly by skin vapor analysis was slope = 0.93, intercept = 1.8, r = 0.94. In controlled studies, skin vapor measurements are comparable with breathalyzer determinations; they may be performed in situations where breathalyzer measurements are inconvenient or where continuous monitoring is desirable.\r"

Adult offspring of pair-fed and chow-fed dams served as nutritional and normal controls, respectively. Pentobarbital (6.25-25.0 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5-10.0 mg/kg) produced significantly greater dose-related hypothermic responses in females than males. Following either pentobarbital or diazepam administration female prenatally ethanol-exposed (E) rats responded with a greater fall in body temperature than the controls. Significantly greater hypothermia occurred in both male and female E rats than in controls when ethanol (1.5 g/kg) was administered together with pentobarbital or diazepam. However, the drug combinations did not produce additive effects on body temperature in any prenatal treatment group. Pentobarbital produced acute cross-tolerance to ethanol while diazepam potentiated ethanol's effect. These studies confirm and extend our previous findings of enhanced hypothermic responses to ethanol in adult rats exposed to ethanol in utero and indicate that maternal alcohol consumption produces long-term effects on the central thermoregulatory systems of offspring.\r"

Animals were studied after 6 weeks of treatment with either ethanol (ETH) or isocaloric dextrose saline (DEX) injections. The amount of surfactant retrieved by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was evaluated by measuring the quantity of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) in the fluid. The amount of DSPC recovered from the ETH animals (40.9 +/- 10.4 micrograms/ml of BAL fluid, mean +/- SD) was significantly lower than from the DEX animals (82.7 +/- 18.6 micrograms/ml of BAL fluid, p less than 0.001). This decrease in surfactant was associated with impairment of the opsonic activity from BAL fluid in the ETH versus DEX animals using a standard assay of bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus) killing with normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes and BAL fluid as an opsonin. We conclude that in the guinea pig model of alcoholism, surfactant deficiency occurs and has physiologic importance in reduced bacterial killing.\r"

The animals were killed 12 hours after ethanol administration and liver weight to body weight ratios and hepatic ascorbic acid concentrations determined. Acute ethanol administration resulted in a 12-fold increase in SGOT levels in animals with hepatic ascorbic acid concentrations at or below 16 mg/100 g of liver. A marked reduction, 60%, in this increase was observed in animals that had concentrations of hepatic ascorbic acid above 16 mg/100 g of liver.

Three liquid diets were formulated ranging in protein content from suboptimal to supraoptimal (18%, 25%, or 32% of total calories) in terms of pregnancy requirements, while ethanol was held constant at high levels (36% of total calories). In addition to the alcohol group (A), both pair-fed (PF) and ad libitum-fed control (C) groups were included in each diet regimen. Basal levels of corticosterone and the adrenocortical response to stress were measured in dams on days 11, 16, or 21 of gestation. Plasma levels of corticosterone-binding globulin (CBG) were also measured on gestation days 16 and 21. Maternal adrenal weights, basal corticosterone levels, the adrenocortical response to stress, and the corticoid stress increment were all significantly increased in A compared to both PF and C females. Plasma CBG levels of A females were similar to or less than those of PF and C females. Thus alcohol consumption significantly increased maternal pituitary-adrenal activity as early as day 11 of gestation and these effects on hormonal function increased as gestation progressed. This adrenocortical hyperactivity was relatively unaffected by maternal nutritional status and thus appears specific to alcohol.\r"

Hence, the development of the ability to absorb and metabolize alcohol in the rat was examined by administering an acute dose (2.5 g/kg) of ethanol in milk formula by intragastric intubation to rats of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 21, 30, and 60 days of age. Each animal in a particular litter was assigned a different time point following intubation when its blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was determined from a tail blood sample. At all ages tested, maximum BACs occurred between 1.25 and 1.5 hr following intubation. However, maximum BACs decreased with age from 155 mg/dl in 1-day-old rats to 111 mg/dl in 60-day-old rats. Furthermore, the rate of alcohol clearance was slower in the younger rats. By linear regression analysis, the elimination rate of alcohol in 1-day-old rats was estimated to be 7.5 mg/dl/hr which increased to 42.2 mg/dl/hr in 60-day-old-rats. By 8 hr following intubation, rats that were 21 days of age and older had completely cleared the alcohol, whereas the younger rats (1-15 days of age) had not. No consistent sex differences were seen in either the maximum BAC or clearance rate. Since developmental changes in the ability to clear alcohol occur throughout the first 60 postnatal days in the rat, controlling for these changes is essential when looking for critical periods of an organ's vulnerability to damage by alcohol.\r"

To examine whether the fibrogenic activity can be detected by blood tests, we evaluated whole antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) of procollagen type III N-terminal peptides (P-III-P), RIA of these peptides using Fab fragments (Fab-P-III-P), and RIA of the laminin P1 peptide in alcoholics within 1 week of alcohol abstinence. The Fab-P-III-P levels in subjects with perivenular fibrosis were significantly higher than those in patients with simple fatty liver. Values in 63% of subjects with perivenular fibrosis exceeded the upper limit of the fatty liver group. Patients with simple fatty liver had significantly lower values than nonalcoholic controls. Serum levels of P-III-P and laminin were elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and correlated well with the degree of inflammation. With abstinence, Fab-P-III-P levels increased in all alcoholics. P-III-P values increased in patients with normal P-III-P values on admission. By contrast, the values of laminin decreased during abstinence. Therefore, to interpret serum levels of Fab-P-III-P, P-III-P, and laminin, the duration of abstinence must be taken into consideration. P-III-P, Fab-P-III-P and laminin measurements in the serum within 1 week of abstinence can contribute to the detection of alcoholic liver disease and the determination of its stage.\r"

Significant differences in the two groups were noted at the end of the study.

The majority of treated patients felt that acupuncture had a definite impact on their desire to drink, whereas only a few control patients noted this effect (p less than 0.015). The results of this study suggest that acupuncture may be able to interdict the cycle of alcoholic recidivism. Further investigation is needed to define the role of acupuncture in the treatment of alcoholism more precisely.\r"

Drinking status was determined from interviews of the subject and a household contact each 2 months and from the analysis of eight blood samples or 39 urines submitted at intervals during the year. Liver status was monitored each 2 months by obtaining serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and AST. Sensitive criteria were arbitrarily selected to identify about 1/5 of the patients with episodic elevations of liver tests. There was no relationship of liver test elevations to disulfiram treatment. However, the elevated AST related significantly to drinking status (p = 0.004) as did elevated bilirubin (p = 0.044), but not elevated alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.146). Two hundred one patients had liver test elevations at least one time and were continued on drug, four were dropped. One hundred seventy-nine of these patients were drinking, 22 were abstinent, and four were indeterminant. It is concluded that patients on disulfiram with minor liver test abnormalities are usually drinking.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of iron and other compounds known to be toxic because of the production of oxygen radicals, e.g., paraquat and menadione on the generation of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) by microsomes from chronic ethanol-fed rats and their pair-fed controls was determined. In the absence of any additions, or in the presence of ferric-chloride, -ADP or -EDTA, microsomes from the ethanol-fed rats showed a 2-fold increase in the production of .OH. Paraquat and menadione increased the generation of .OH by microsomes from the ethanol-fed and the pair-fed controls to an identical extent and thus these promoters of oxidative stress were not any more effective in interacting with microsomes after ethanol treatment. Under all conditions, .OH generation was sensitive to inhibition by catalase, implicating H2O2 as the precursor of .OH, whereas superoxide dismutase was without any significant effect. A working scheme to accommodate aspects of the interaction of iron, menadione and paraquat with microsomes with the subsequent production of .OH is described. The fact that .OH generation by microsomes in the presence of several sources of iron such as unchelated iron or ferric-ADP is elevated after chronic ethanol consumption could contribute to the hepatotoxic effects of ethanol. Studies on iron metabolism by liver cells and the effect of ethanol on the disposition of this critical trace metal are needed to further evaluate the role of oxygen radicals in the actions of ethanol.\r"

In order to provide details of these effects, the cortical cell numbers and the cerebellar layer volumes were studied in adult rats fed alcohol for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months and compared with respective age-matched controls. Significant decreases of granular and molecular layer volumes were found after 3 and 6 months of alcohol feeding, respectively. No significant differences were found in the Purkinje cell layer volume. Neuron countings showed that granule cells and molecular layer interneurons were the earliest and most severely affected populations. A decrease in the number of Purkinje cells was observed only after 18 months of alcohol consumption and Golgi cells were not significantly reduced. Thus, we concluded that cerebellar neurons have a selective vulnerability to alcohol which might alter the balance between excitatory and inhibitory limbs of the cerebellar circuitry.\r"

  ".W": "The effects on regional myocardial blood flows (RMBF) and hemodynamics due to ethanol administered before and after acute coronary artery ligation (CAL) in 18 anesthetized dogs were studied. Ethanol was administered to seven dogs (group I) prior to CAL and to six dogs (group II) after CAL; five dogs (group III, control) received only saline before and after CAL. Uniform blood ethanol levels (180 +/- 30 mg/dl) were maintained in groups I and II after initial ethanol administration. In these groups the heart rate and rate-pressure product (which reflects myocardial oxygen consumption) remained stable, but pulmonary arterial pressures were elevated. Other hemodynamic parameters remained stable in all groups. Ethanol caused a significant transmural increase of RMBF (p less than 0.001) in both groups I and II. In group II the increase was significant in both nonischemic and ischemic tissues, with no apparent redistribution of flow among the myocardial layers. The percentage increase of RMBF due to ethanol was highest in group II nonischemic tissue (95-107%) compared to the corresponding ischemic tissue (57-60%) and the group I myocardial tissue (36-47%) prior to CAL (p less than 0.001). The observed differences between ethanol pre- and posttreatments suggest different interactions between ethanol and catecholamines. The results also confirm that vasodilatory reserve is present in the acutely ischemic myocardium and that the local availability of ethanol is important for coronary vasodilatation.\r"

Temperature-dependent phase transition also was determined, as were comparisons between ESR parameters, at the 1st and 5th week after alcohol withdrawal. Ethanol-induced fluidity was significantly greater in membranes of control subjects compared with alcoholic patients. Baseline fluidity did not differ and the temperature at which the phase transition occurred was not significantly different between the two groups. The resistance of membranes of alcoholic patients to fluidization by ethanol was unchanged after 5 weeks of withdrawal. Comparisons between ethanol-induced fluidization at the 1st and 5th week after withdrawal were not significantly different. These studies demonstrate differences in ethanol-induced fluidization between alcoholic patients and control subjects that are consistent with earlier ESR studies using an animal model.\r"

The measures of frequency, quantity, and density (heavy drinking once or more a month) significantly intercorrelate, and the self-reported alcohol consumption by this sample is satisfactorily stable and consistent with nationwide sales figures. None of the drinking measures was associated with twin type (zygosity), and only density correlated with age. Similarity of drinking habits among twin brothers was evaluated as a function of their genetic resemblance and age, the frequency of their social contact with one another, and the interactions of these terms. The effects were estimated from hierarchical linear regressions of a double-entry data matrix from which each twin's drinking was predicted from that of his twin brother, and that pair's age, zygosity, cohabitation status, and frequency of social contact. Significant genetic variance was found for each of the drinking measures with heritability estimates ranging from 0.36 to 0.40. Co-twins in more frequent social contact with one another reported greater similarity in their use of alcohol, but heritable variance remained after the effects of age and social contact were removed from both mean levels and co-twin resemblance. Reported frequency of passouts yielded significant, but equivalent, correlations in both MZ and DZ twins and no evidence of genetic influence.\r"

  ".W": "The magnitude of prostaglandin [16,16-dimethylprostaglandin E2 (DMPGE2)] protection against ethanol action has been evaluated by studying the intracellular events leading to synthesis, modification, intracellular retention, and secretion of mucus glycoprotein in the rat gastric mucosal cell culture. When metabolic activity of the cultured cells was expressed as the amount of radioactive tracer in purified mucus glycoprotein, it was found that ethanol at low concentration (0.1 M) caused an 8- to 9-fold increase in proline and a 5- to 6-fold increase in palmitic acid incorporation into mucus glycoprotein; however, at 1.5 M ethanol, the synthetic processes ceased to function. In the presence of DMPGE2 (10 ng/ml), a 2-fold increase in proline and a 3-fold increase in palmitic acid incorporation into mucus glycoprotein were observed. A simultaneous addition of DMPGE2 (10 ng/ml) and ethanol (0.1-1.5 M), or pretreatment with DMPGE2 (10 ng/ml) for 20 min followed by the addition of ethanol (0.1-1.5 M), resulted in the stabilization of glycoprotein synthesis and secretion, and in restoration of the function at the level observed with DMPGE2 alone. The addition of 10 ng/ml of DMPGE2 caused a 32% increase in mucus glycoprotein secretion and an 11% increase in the intracellular content of the glycoprotein. The amount of mucus apoprotein precursor rose by 18%, and the fatty acylation of the synthesized peptides was up by 38%. Addition of DMPGE2, together with ethanol, prevented depletion of the intracellular glycoprotein stores. As observed with ethanol alone, the secretion was elevated by 16-27%, whereas the intracellular glycoprotein stores remained similar to those of controls. The synthesis of the mucus apoprotein precursor was highly sensitive to ethanol, and addition of DMPGE2 only partially prevented its inhibitory action. Pretreatment with DMPGE2, however, eliminated ethanol toxicity, and the precursor pool level remained elevated (28-30%) at all concentrations of ethanol tested. The fatty acylation, although positively affected by DMPGE2, decreased steadily with increments of ethanol concentration. The results show that DMPGE2 stabilizes the cellular membrane processes and thus imposes control over mucus glycoprotein synthesis, secretion, and its intracellular retention.\r"

Finally, within the alcohol group, alcohol history was found to significantly correlate with nighttime mean and minimum SaO2 and absolute SaO2 desaturation. This preliminary study finds evidence that chronic alcohol abuse may predispose an individual to nighttime hypoxemia, and, inferentially, to sleep apnea. However, the effect is modest and it will need to be confirmed in larger, more carefully controlled studies.\r"

Our data fail to substantiate that pyridoxine-deficient animals are more susceptible to the hepatotoxic effects of ethanol than pair-fed pyridoxine-sufficient controls. Furthermore, the addition of pyridoxine to hepatocyte cultures fails to prevent in vitro cytotoxicity of added ethanol. Pyridoxine deficiency may augment ethanol-induced enhancement of hepatic urea synthesis. These data suggest that pyridoxine deficiency may contribute to the abnormal plasma amino acid profiles and nitrogen balance of chronic alcoholics, but that it does not potentiate ethanol-induced liver injury.\r"

However, the data indicate that there is little support across research groups for any specific relationship and, at best, the effect of alcohol consumption accounts for only a small proportion of variance. Consideration of test validity suggests that the principal measure of ability used in this research is not capable of elucidating cerebral deficit. Further, the pattern of observed correlations is not consistent with the assumption that the putative effects of social drinking involve deficits less severe but similar in type to those seen in chronic alcoholics. Instead, an association between innate ability, demographic variables, and drinking behavior in the general population is the most parsimonious explanation of all the data.\r"

Postoperatively, patients received a 24-hour intramuscular infusion of either saline (n = 20), ketorolac 1.5 mg/hour (n = 21) or ketorolac 3.0 mg/hour (n = 20). Cumulative morphine requirements were measured using a patient-controlled analgesia system which delivered intravenous increments of morphine on demand. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scores. Arterial blood gas analyses were performed pre-operatively and on the first postoperative day. Patients who received low and high dose ketorolac infusions required less morphine than the control group (p less than 0.05 and p = 0.06, respectively). This was associated with significantly lower pain scores. Patients who received the higher ketorolac dose had significantly less postoperative increase in arterial carbon dioxide tensions than controls. This study suggests that ketorolac tromethamine is a useful analgesic drug with significant morphine sparing properties.\r"

Changes in hepatic arterial blood flow and portal blood flow, as well as total hepatic blood flow during halothane anesthesia were more closely associated with changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output than during anesthesia with isoflurane or fentanyl. Halothane or isoflurane administered in concentrations that decreased MAP by approximately 30% were accompanied by decreases in hepatic oxygen delivery (DO2th) averaging 46% during halothane and 31% during isoflurane anesthesia and parallel decreases in hepatic blood flow. In concentrations that decreased MAP by 50%, halothane and isoflurane decreased DO2th 61 and 37%, respectively. DO2th was maintained (statistically insignificant, 23% increase) during both doses of fentanyl administered (20 micrograms/kg followed by 0.17 microgram . kg-1 . min-1, and 50 micrograms/kg followed by 0.42 microgram . kg-1 . min-1). Hepatic oxygen uptake increased 50% during fentanyl and was maintained at baseline levels during both doses of halothane and isoflurane anesthesia. Oxygen content in hepatic venous blood was maintained at baseline levels during fentanyl and isoflurane administration and was decreased by both concentrations of halothane anesthesia. The hepatic oxygen supply demand ratio was maintained at baseline levels after both doses of fentanyl and during isoflurane administered in a concentration that decreased blood pressure 30%; the ratio decreased during isoflurane administered in a concentration decreasing blood pressure by 50% and during both doses of halothane anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After sufentanil injection, good postoperative analgesia was obtained, with a linear analog score (LAS) of less than 5 starting 5 min after injection and lasting for more than 6 hr. Linear analog scores obtained during coughing (LASC) and during movement (LASM) were less than 5 after 10 min and lasted for more than 4 hr. Respiratory rate decreased significantly for 2 hr after sufentanil injection. After morphine, pain relief started after 20 min and lasted for more than 12 hr. Respiratory rate decreased after 30 min. Sedation was greater after sufentanil than after morphine. PaCO2, which increased significantly 1 hr after sufentanil, did not change after morphine. Peak expiratory flow significantly improved for 2 hr after both sufentanil and morphine, whereas forced vital capacity improved for 4 hr after sufentanil and 8 hr after morphine administration. Forced expiratory volume did not change with either drug. It is concluded that 5 mg morphine injected epidurally provides longer lasting analgesia than does 50 micrograms sufentanil, but that in the first hours analgesia is better after sufentanil. Injection of either drug was accompanied by remarkable cardiovascular stability.\r"

  ".W": "The noncontroversial fact regarding ECT seems to be that controversy exists in almost every area of its use, its art, and its science. The nature of the treatment itself, its history of abuse, unfavorable media presentations, special attention by the legal system, uneven distribution of use among facilities and practitioners, and lack of certified standards for psychiatric training in ECT have tended, in the past 2 decades, to swing the pendulum towards the use of tricyclic and other antidepressant agents for the treatment of severe depression. Despite recommendations for continual review of data and of clinical and research experience, few pertinent reports by anesthesiologists have appeared. Guidelines for the anesthesiologist have not been established. Due to the pervading presence in earlier studies of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis, it is futile to compare findings of unmodified ECT to modified ECT. More recent studies relating especially to cardiovascular abnormalities have also been difficult to evaluate because of widely varying formats, use of different agents and dosages, continuance or discontinuance of psychotropic drugs, and variability of ventilation and concentrations of oxygen. ECT is a modality that has not outlived its usefulness. With proper pretreatment, selection and evaluation of patients, use of appropriate modification techniques, and careful clinical management and monitoring during treatment, ECT can be both safe and effective, even in relatively high-risk patients. ECT provides an exciting challenge for concerned physicians to explore the role of brain function and behavior, and the effects of seizures on neuroendocrine mechanisms, neurohumoral mechanisms, cerebral metabolism, the blood-brain barrier, and ion transport systems. It may lead to further understanding of the action of general anesthetics, CNS depressant drugs, and the effects of stimulation of the central autonomic nervous system and the endocrine systems. A close interaction between basic and clinically oriented researchers holds the key to designing studies that can answer these critical questions, rather than continuation of studies that merely generate more data.\r"

During the operation and the postoperative period various hemorheological and hemostasiological alterations acquire clinical significance: 1. hyperreagibility of platelets with increased aggregation and adhesion tendency 2. changes in fibrinogen, albumin, and globulin concentrations, which affect viscosity and red cell aggregation 3. impairment of red cell deformability 4. increase in clotting factors 5. disturbance of fibrinolysis characterized by diminution of plasmatic plasmin and increase in antiplasmin activity In addition, anesthetic techniques have also been shown to affect hemorheological and hemostasiological parameters. The complex pattern of pathohemorheological and hemostasiological changes shows that thromboembolism in the course of surgical interventions is provoked by multifactorial disorders. Thrombosis prevention should, therefore, counteract both hemorheological and hemostasiological disturbances. Since pathohemorheological and pathohemostasiological changes are already detectable before, and increase during operation, preventive measures should start before the surgical intervention to obtain maximum benefit. Therapeutic possibilities for the avoidance of these multifactorial disturbances are discussed with particular reference to pentoxifylline, which satisfies the complex requirements of a hemorheologically and hemostasiologically active therapeutic agent.\r"

Assays were done singly to simulate the in-office use of the machine. Their respective coefficients of variations (CVs) were 6.96%, 5.50%, and 5.23%, which compared favorably with the established CVs for the Emit of 6.7%, 5.8%, and 6.1% respectively at comparable test concentrations. Two hundred and fifty-one sera were assayed in parallel on both machines in eight batches. Linear regression analysis of these data showed a slope of 0.995, intercept of 0.468, and a correlation coefficient of 0.945. These data suggest that the Seralyzer values compared favorably with the Emit values.\r"

Histamine inhalation challenges were performed before (control) and 45, 150, and 300 minutes after zindotrine (200 and 300 mg), or the corresponding dose of placebo was administered orally in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion. When compared to the control state, the 300-mg zindotrine dose markedly lowered histamine airway responsiveness as indicated by a significant (P less than .01) increase in the inhaled histamine dose necessary to provoke a 20% decrease in the forced expired volume in one second (PD20FEV1) 45 minutes after drug administration. The PD20FEV1 then decreased linearly over time but remained higher than the control PD20FEV1 value (P less than .05) during the entire observation period. The 200-mg zindotrine dose failed to affect the PD20FEV1.

As newer therapeutic agents become available to treat the various reactions to stings caused by these animals, an accurate diagnosis of the type of reaction the patient experiences and of the offending species will be necessary. Fatal reactions may be caused either by anaphylaxis or by the action of toxins in the venom on the heart, respiratory center, or kidneys. Cutaneous eruptions after envenomation may be local, generalized, exaggerated, recurrent, delayed, persistent, or occur at sites distant from the primary sting. Fat atrophy, pigmentary changes, vasospasm, and contractures with gangrene can occur after jellyfish stings. Identification of the envenoming animal can be made by actual visualization, examination for nematocysts on skin scraping, or serologically. It may also be predicted based on knowledge of location, time, and environmental circumstances of the encounter. First-aid measures designed to prevent additional nematocyst rupture are species-specific. Anaphylaxis should be prevented by the appropriate lifesaving measures. Other syndromes, caused by the toxins of the venom or mediated by humoral or cellular immune mechanisms, should be treated specifically.\r"

  ".W": "Sea snakes are the most abundant venomous reptiles, found throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Divided into two subfamilies, Laticaudinae and Hydrophiinae, all sea snakes are poisonous. Venoms are highly toxic, as indicated by low LD50 values in test animals. Toxic compounds include presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins. Similarities in phylogeny are reflected in immunodiffusion patterns, immunoelectrophoresis, cross-neutralization by antivenin against heterologous venoms, and amino acid composition. The clinical syndrome following a bite is largely neurotoxic and myotoxic, with rare hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Proper emergency field therapy and timely administration of antivenin can be lifesaving. Hemodialysis may be useful when antivenin is not available.\r"

  ".W": "Bromelain is a plant proteinase derived from the stem of the pineapple plant that has been used successfully to debride the eschar from third-degree burn injuries. Its applicability to frostbite eschar removal was extrapolated and investigated. Third-degree frostbite lesions were produced on swine using supercooled air as the freezing media, and the resulting eschars were treated with a bromelain preparation. In the initial trial, no debridement other than that of the superficial layers of the eschar was noted. The experiment then was repeated with the introduction of third-degree burn injuries as a control to validate the efficacy of the enzyme preparation. Although the burn injuries debrided to a graftable bed after two applications of the enzyme, the frostbite injuries remained unaffected. It was concluded that the patent vasculature, resulting tissue edema, and lack of coagulation of proteins found in the freeze injury are sufficient to inactivate the bromelain enzyme before tissue digestion and dissection can be effected.\r"

When the total amount of work achieved by the running rat prior to exhaustion was plotted against the rate of heat storage, a heretofore unrecognized relationship emerged. These new data suggest that physical exhaustion and heat exhaustion represent opposite ends of a continuum related to the rate of heat storage. Changes in thermoregulatory and/or physical performance can be estimated by a two-dimensional shift in the work-output/thermal storage ratio. Potassium depletion reduces thermoregulatory/physical performance; a combination of atropine plus diazepam appears to improve it. The role of the cholinergic nervous system in eliciting alterations in thermoregulatory and physical ability is reviewed; endurance training, shivering, acclimatization, set-point theory, the anticholinergic syndrome, lithium intoxication, and choline deficiency are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87324371\r", 
  ".W": "Immunologic tests for detection of snake venom and venom antibodies have important clinical applications. Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) provide adequate specificity and sensitivity. The former is much more widely used because it is inexpensive, relatively easy to perform, and uses stable reagents. Some ELISA systems will detect 0.5 ng of venom; however, a sensitivity of 10 to 100 ng is more usual. Minimum running time is 30 to 45 minutes; with longer times, greater sensitivity can be attained. Wound aspirate, serum, and urine are the most suitable materials for venom detection. ELISA has been used for clinical diagnosis of snakebite, to monitor antivenom dose, to study clinical syndromes associated with envenomation, to detect venom in forensic cases, and to evaluate first aid techniques. The indirect ELISA usually is used for detecting and titrating venom antibody. This is potentially useful in epidemiological studies of snakebite incidence, in evaluating potency and paraspecific activity of antivenoms, and in studying response to venom immunogens. Current ELISA systems involving snake venoms have low specificity, and most cannot reliably differentiate venoms of related snakes. Venom antibody detection assays are less satisfactory than those for venom; nonspecific reactions and cross-reactivity are unacceptably high. Methods for improvement of snake venom immunodiagnosis are discussed.\r"

Health effects include the well-recognized altitude-specific syndromes of acute mountain sickness and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Emphasis is placed in this article on altitude-aggravated illness or those preexisting conditions that may be adversely affected by reduced O2 availability at high altitude. Examples from studies of pregnant women and their infants at high altitude are reviewed to demonstrate the effect of high altitude on maternal and fetal well-being. Increased maternal ventilation and ventilatory response to hypoxia during pregnancy at 10,200 ft (3,110 m) and 14,200 ft (4,329 m) raised arterial O2 saturation, helped to preserve arterial O2 content at levels present when nonpregnant, and correlated positively with the offspring's birth weight. Fetal growth retardation and an increased incidence of the complications of pre-eclampsia and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia at high altitude suggested that altitude may aggravate complications of pregnancy and prenatal life. Other conditions that may be aggravated at high altitude are reviewed. Virtually all studies on altitude-aggravated illness have been conducted on permanent residents. Future studies should seek to determine whether high altitude aggravates pre-existing conditions among the large and growing number of high-altitude visitors.\r"

Data from human studies and animal models indicate that active immunization and B cell function are unimpaired, whereas T cell function is blunted following exposure to hypoxia.

Descent to lower altitude is still considered the treatment of choice, but an increased role for medical therapy is emerging. Acetazolamide is currently the drug of choice for prevention of AMS, and probably HAPE as well. Numerous studies have demonstrated the drug's effectiveness when it is started 12 to 24 hours before ascent. Suggestions for indications, dosage, and regimen vary with different authors. Lower dosage offers adequate protection with fewer side effects. Acetazolamide has still not been adequately studied for treatment of altitude illness. Oxygen effectively treats HAPE and mild AMS, but is not as useful for cerebral edema. Dexamethasone recently was found effective for treatment of AMS, including early cerebral edema, but not for advanced cerebral edema. Side effects limit its use for prophylaxis, but dexamethasone offers an alternative to acetazolamide for those with sulfa intolerance.\r"

The history and clinical presentation of HAPE, as well as the known underlying pathophysiology, are reviewed. For instance, in HAPE there is an association with blunted respiratory drives to hypoxia and accentuated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Recent data show that HAPE is a high permeability leak of protein into the alveolar space associated with an influx of alveolar macrophages. These data have been obtained recently by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the field setting of Mt McKinley at 4,400 m. The approach to recognition and treatment that involves primarily descent and/or oxygen is discussed.\r"

Two antihistamines, orally administered chlorpheniramine maleate (CM) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (DH) administered by intranasal spray, were used under double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled conditions to assess both tolerance and efficacy in volunteers with experimental rhinovirus (RV) colds. In the initial trial, CM (4.0 mg per treatment) was ingested 4 times daily for 4 days beginning 24 h after intranasal inoculation of RV type 29 in susceptible volunteers. In the second trial, DH was sprayed intranasally 4 times daily (2 mg per treatment) for 5 days beginning 24 h after inoculation of RV type 39. Clinical colds occurred in 60% of the CM group (n = 13) and 73% of the placebo (n = 15) in the first study, and in 66% of the DH group (n = 12) compared with 81% in the placebo group (n = 11) in the second. Both CM and DH were well tolerated but had no significant effects on nasal symptoms or nasal mucus production. The findings provide additional evidence against an important role for histamine in the pathogenesis of nasal symptomatology in rhinovirus colds.\r"

Twelve patients were studied during an active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and 12 patients were studied during allograft rejection or during a stable phase after renal transplantation (control subjects). No patients had pulmonary symptoms nor abnormal chest radiographs or arterial blood gas determinations. During an active CMV infection, DLCO was significantly reduced compared with the measurements made during allograft rejection or during a stable phase after renal transplantation. This was true both with (p less than 0.01) and without (p less than 0.01) correction for the hemoglobin concentration. Serum C3d levels were increased in 8 of the 12 patients with a CMV infection, but not in any of the patients in the control group. In 8 patients with a CMV infection, measurements were made of the anaphylatoxin C3a, and were found to be significantly higher than the levels in the control population (p less than 0.01). We conclude that our data are consistent with pulmonary dysfunction in every patient with an active CMV infection. The concomitant findings of complement activation and formation of anaphylatoxins suggest a causal relationship of the complement activation and a decreased DLCO, although further studies are warranted to determine the exact role of complement in the pulmonary events during an active CMV infection after renal transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We also examined changes in pharyngeal area resulting from the application of positive intrapharyngeal pressure in sitting and supine posture. We found that (1) pharyngeal cross-sectional area at FRC was similar in both groups, (2) decrease in pharyngeal area with assumption of supine posture was also similar in both groups (21 +/- 11% in patients with OSA versus 15 +/- 13% in nonapneic control subjects), and (3) pharyngeal distensibility was significantly higher in apneic snorers than in nonapneic control subjects (0.090 +/- 0.039 cm H2O-1 in apneic snorers versus 0.032 +/- 0.027 cm H2O-1 in nonapneic control subjects; p less than 0.005).

This simple mixture, suspended at 15 mg lipid X ml-1 water, has appropriate in vitro characteristics for a lung surfactant substitute. As determined by static pressure volume relationships performed after 30 min ventilation, lungs treated with Exosurf accepted significantly more gas at maximal inflation (36 versus 15 ml X kg-1 body weight) and had significantly greater volumes during deflation that did saline-treated control lungs; lungs treated with natural rabbit surfactant (SAM) had significantly larger volumes at maximal inflation (65 versus 35 ml X kg-1) and during deflation than did the Exosurf-treated lungs. After 30 min of ventilation with oxygen and fixation at 10 cm H2O pressure, the ratio of air space to tissue space was determined by a point-counting technique, and mean linear intercepts were measured for air spaces. Exosurf-treated lungs were intermediate between SAM and saline-treated lungs in both measurements. With positive pressure ventilation to maintain a tidal volume of 6.5 to 7.5 ml X kg-1, total compliance was significantly greater and inspiratory pressure significantly lower in both SAM- and Exosurf-treated animals than in saline-treated control animals, although the lungs of the SAM-treated animals were more compliant than the lungs of animals treated with Exosurf. During the first minute of positive pressure ventilation, lungs treated with SAM or Exosurf expanded equally rapidly, both expanding more rapidly than the saline-treated lungs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 2 groups were similar with respect to age, gender, and severity of illness. In patients with initially high EVLW, EVLW fell to a greater extent in PM than in RM patients (18 +/- 5 versus 4 +/- 8% decrease, p less than 0.05). This difference was even greater in patients with heart failure. No adverse effects on oxygenation or renal function occurred in following the protocol. Mortality for the groups as a whole was similar, but was significantly better (p less than 0.05) for PM patients with initially high EVLW and normal Ppaw (predominantly patients with sepsis or the adult respiratory distress syndrome). For both groups, patients with an initial EVLW greater than 14 ml/kg had a significantly greater mortality than did those with a lesser amount of EVLW: 13 of 15 (87%) versus 13 of 32 (41%), p less than 0.05. We conclude that management based on a protocol using EVLW measurements is safe, may hasten the resolution of pulmonary edema, and may lead to improved outcome in some critically ill patients.\r"

Although the physiologic and biochemical consequences of oxygen toxicity have been described in newborn and adult animals, there have been no controlled observations in prematures. We compared the physiologic and morphologic effects of prolonged hyperoxia with those of clinically appropriate oxygen in premature baboons with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) supported with conventional positive pressure ventilation and continuous distending airway pressure (PPV/PEEP). Twenty-one premature baboons were delivered at 140 days gestation, intubated and resuscitated, and supported with PPV/PEEP and standard NICU techniques for 11 days. The FIO2, PaO2, PaCO2, pHa, ventilator and airway pressures, and blood pressure were intermittently measured and recorded. The physiologic observations could be divided into 3 distinct phases. During Phase 1 (0 to 42 h) there were no significant intergroup differences, and (a/A)PO2 and IO2 (oxygenation index; (a/A)PO2/Paw) remained stable. In Phase 2 (43 to 96 h) there was a rapid improvement in (a/A)PO2 and IO2 in both groups, but the response in the hyperoxic animals was significantly dampened. During Phase 3 (97 to 264 h) there was continued improvement in the \"prn\" animals, which contrasted with progressive deterioration in those exposed to FIO2 1.0. Five of 11 \"prn\" and 3 of 10 FIO2 1.0 baboons developed air leaks during Phase 1 or early Phase 2. Four of 10 of the hyperoxic animals died after the late onset of air leak. Pathologic changes of BPD were found in all FIO2 1.0 animals surviving more than 6 days but in none of the \"prn\" long-term survivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relationship between lung anatomy and pulmonary mechanics in acute respiratory failure (ARF), 20 patients with ARF underwent computerized tomography (CT) at 3 levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (5, 10, and 15 cm H2O). The static pressure-volume curve of the total respiratory system and the lung volumes (helium dilution method) were also measured. By knowing the lung volumes and analyzing the CT number frequency distribution, a quantitative estimate of normally aerated, poorly aerated, and nonaerated lung tissue was obtained at each level of PEEP. The recruitment was defined as the percent increase of normally aerated tissue from 5 to 15 cm H2O. We found that the different compliances (starting compliance, inflation compliance, and deflation compliance) were correlated only with the amount of normally aerated tissue present in the range of pressures explored by a given compliance (5 cm H2O for starting compliance and 15 cm H2O for inflation and deflation compliances). No relationship was found between the compliances and the poorly aerated and nonaerated tissue. The specific compliance was in the normal range, whereas the amount of recruitment was related to the ratio of inflation compliance to starting compliance. Our data suggest that (1) the pressure-volume curve parameters in ARF investigate only the residual healthy zones of the lung and do not directly estimate the \"amount\" of disease (poorly or nonaerated tissue), (2) the pressure-volume curve may allow an estimate of the anatomic recruitment, and (3) the residual normally aerated zones of the ARF lung seem to maintain a normal intrinsic elasticity.\r"

  ".W": "Prostacyclin and PGE1 show promise in treatment of many forms of pulmonary hypertension. Their clinical use can be expected to increase as their pulmonary vasodilating effects become better known. There is as yet no unequivocal reason to choose one agent over the other, but several observations suggest that prostacyclin will eventually be preferred. First, prostacyclin appears to have a shorter half-life (1 to 2 min), which means that any drug-induced adverse effects will disappear more quickly. Although it is commonly said that up to 80% of PGE1 is metabolized with one passage through the lungs, in one study 34% of intravenously administered radiolabeled PGE1 remained in the bloodstream 20 min after administration. Second, prostacyclin causes less severe and less prolonged rebound platelet activation after discontinuation. Third, prostacyclin has been shown to reduce resting pulmonary vascular tone and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in virtually every published study in every species tested at every stage of development (fetal, newborn, and adult life); results with PGE1, although very impressive, have been less consistent. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that PGE1 is a powerful pulmonary vasodilator in most clinical situations complicated by pulmonary hypertension. Further, PGE1 is available for clinical use, while prostacyclin remains an investigational drug. Thus, it is likely that PGE1 will become the \"nitroprusside\" of the lesser circuit for intensive care use, a position PGE1 will hold alone at least until prostacyclin becomes available. Chronic infusions of prostacyclin may prove particularly useful in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension awaiting heart-lung transplantation. Eventually, orally available prostacyclin and PGE1 analogs will offer a new therapeutic avenue in many diseases complicated by chronic pulmonary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), in which no cause for a rise in pulmonary artery pressure can be found, is characterized by a \"restriction\" of the peripheral pulmonary vascular bed. Treatment is directed at the consequences of this, namely, the low cardiac output. Oral anticoagulants appear to improve prognosis, as in other low cardiac output states, by preventing intravascular coagulation. Oral vasodilators are not uniformly successful in improving cardiac output. Acute intravenous infusion of prostacyclin (PGI2) lowers both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance in normal subjects and patients with PPH. Long-term infusion in patients with a poor prognosis, that is, with a PA saturation O2 less than 63%, has, in an uncontrolled study, improved symptoms and rate of maximal oxygen consumption (V max O2) during progressive exercise testing. Its more general use in PPH awaits controlled studies, but there is a possibility that, in addition to its vasodilator properties and the ability to impede platelet aggregation and adherence, PGI2 long term may influence the progressive nature of PPH.\r"

Design: Randomized control trial. Setting: University-affiliated general hospital. Patients: Of 111 consecutive patients considered, 103 had acute proximal or calf vein thrombosis confirmed by ascending venography and met all other eligibility criteria. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous or intravenous heparin. The subcutaneous regimen consisted of an initial dose of 15,000 U, adjusted thereafter to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time to 50 to 70 seconds. The continuous intravenous regimen was begun as a bolus injection of 5000 U, followed by an infusion of 1250 U/h, adjusted to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time at 50 to 70 seconds. Measurements and Main Results: There was no significant difference in the rate of new pulmonary embolism between the two groups, as defined by new high-probability defect on repeat ventilation-perfusion scintigrams of the lung in 96 (93%) of the patients after 7 to 10 days of treatment. Five of forty-seven patients in the subcutaneous group and 5 of 49 in the intravenous group developed pulmonary embolism (95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference, -13.1% to 12.2%). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the frequency of hemorrhagic complications. Five of fifty-one patients in the subcutaneous group and 5 of 52 in the intravenous group had hemorrhagic complications (95% CI for the difference, -11.2% to 11.6%). Conclusion: Adjusted subcutaneous calcium heparin may be an effective and safe alternative to continuous intravenous calcium heparin in the initial treatment of acute proximal deep vein thrombosis.\r"

Alternating chemotherapy was cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine alternating with etoposide (100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3) every 3 weeks for six treatment cycles. Two hundred eighty-nine patients were eligible and evaluable for response to therapy and survival. Best response was higher in patients on alternating chemotherapy (complete plus partial response, 80% compared with 63.2%; p less than 0.002). Progression-free survival for patients on alternating chemotherapy was superior (p less than 0.0001) as was overall survival (p = 0.03). Major toxicities were equally frequent in both treatment groups. These results show a modest superiority of alternating chemotherapy over standard therapy in extensive small cell lung cancer.\r"

Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were compared after subcutaneous injections of 0.2 U/kg body weight of regular biosynthetic human insulin or regular purified pork insulin in a double-blind randomized crossover trial. Meal glycemic excursions improved after the administration of biosynthetic human insulin, when compared with purified pork insulin (p less than 0.05 at 150, 180, and 210 minutes postprandially). Serum free immunoreactive insulin concentrations were significantly higher after injections of biosynthetic human insulin, and the rate of incremental rise during the first 30 minutes was also greater. Insulin antibody studies showed a strong negative correlation between peak insulin levels and the association constant for the high-affinity-binding insulin antibodies. We conclude that biosynthetic human insulin is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than is purified pork insulin, a characteristic that results in improved postprandial metabolic control.\r"

This effect was relatively selective, since the immediately adjacent cholinergic neurons in the striatum did not show a change of similar magnitude. The shrinkage of these basal forebrain neurons may account for the decline of cholinergic innervation that occurs with age. In the material that we examined, aging did not influence the number of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, only their size. It seems, therefore, that the age-related changes in cholinergic function (and their putative behavioral consequences) are not associated with a substantial component of irreversible cell death.\r"

This was also assessed in the concentrated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of most of these patients, as well as in sera of 60 blood donors (BD). Standardized amounts of serum IgG and CSF IgG were used in ELISA. For sera, higher reactivity with HTLV-I was found in all four patient groups compared with the BD group, but no significant differences were observed among the four groups. There was higher reactivity with HTLV-I in the CSF of patients with MS, AM, and GB compared to findings in patients with TH. Ten serum (2 MS, 3 GB, 3 TH, 2 BD) and 3 CSF (1 MS, 1 GB, 1 TH) specimens considered positive by ELISA for HTLV-I were found negative on confirmatory Western blot analysis. We extended this study to analyze the in vitro production of anti-HTLV-I-IgG antibodies by the 24-hour cultivation of unstimulated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and CSF of 6 additional patients with MS directly in HTLV-I antigen-coated wells of microtiter plates. This was followed by determination of specific antibodies by ELISA in the same wells. No antibody production was measurable. Our data do not favor the hypothesis of an HTLV-I-related human retrovirus in the etiology of MS.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1980, RP chromatography has been the principal analytical technique used for cephalosporins. This technology offers selectivity, accuracy, and ease of use. Most of the methods rely on protein precipitation and, to a lesser extent, solid-phase isolation or extraction procedures. The proper selection of a method depends on the analytical constraints imposed by the overall objective of the study. For example, pharmacokinetic datum interpretation mandates that the method be validated and provide specific and accurate results. LC is the preferred technique, since it not only meets these specifications but may also distinguish between the drug and metabolites. Those chromatographic methods which quantify several different cephalosporins are not desirable for pharmacokinetic datum interpretation, since accuracy and precision are usually compromised in order that many different drugs may be quantified in a single analysis. The proper selection of sample preparation method is dependent on the presence of potential interferences and the acceptable lower limit of quantitation. Protein precipitation methods offer ease of sample preparation but may suffer from nonselectivity. Solid-phase isolation and extraction procedures may increase selectivity and improve the limit of quantitation. Although LC provides specific and accurate results, clinical laboratories may prefer to use the less specific methods for therapeutic drug monitoring. In this case, microbiological, enzymatic, and fluorimetric methods offer improved sample throughput but less specificity. However, these methods should not be used for drugs that may have a low margin of safety or if the patient is on multiple-antibiotic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In trial 1, lozenges containing either zinc gluconate (23 mg of elemental zinc) or placebo were given 36 h after nasal inoculation of rhinovirus type 39 and administered eight times per day for 5 days. All of the volunteers had early cold symptoms at the time that treatment was begun. In trial 2, the same lozenge regimen was used, beginning 2 h after nasal inoculation with rhinovirus type 13, and continued for 7 days. Zinc therapy did not reduce the severity or duration of cold symptoms or the frequency or duration of viral shedding in either trial. Viral titers were measured in trial 2 and were shown to be unaffected by zinc therapy. Nasal mucus weights and the numbers of paper tissues used were slightly higher in zinc recipients. A statistically significant increase in levels of zinc in serum was documented in zinc recipients after 5 days of therapy. These data suggest that zinc gluconate lozenge therapy is not therapeutically useful in the treatment of rhinovirus colds.\r"

  ".W": "The response of Streptococcus pyogenes to amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin; Beecham Group) therapy of a mixed streptococcal-staphylococcal infection was studied in a surgical wound in mice. A superficial wound was produced on the backs of anesthetized mice, and a suture infected with S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, or a mixed inoculum of both organisms was inserted. Oral therapy was started 4 h after infection and continued for 3 days. Both amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were effective in eliminating the streptococci from the pure wound infection. In contrast, amoxicillin failed to eliminate the streptococci from a mixed infection in which a beta-lactamase-producing strain of S. aureus was also present, wound counts reaching 10(7) streptococci per wound by 80 h, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanic acid reduced the count to less than 33 streptococci per wound by 24 h. Numbers of S. aureus were also reduced by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy, controlling the infection, whereas amoxicillin was ineffective. Also of significance was the fact that successful therapy was achieved with blood and tissue concentrations of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of the same order as those measured in humans. These results show that amoxicillin therapy failed to eliminate S. pyogenes from a wound infection in the presence of a beta-lactamase-producing strain of S. aureus and suggest the potential of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in the treatment of mixed bacterial skin infections involving beta-lactamase-producing organisms.\r"

Of the compounds studied, pyrazofurin and 3-deazaguanine emerged as more potent inhibitors of respiratory syncytial virus than ribavirin. Based on their inhibitory effect on the cytopathogenicity of respiratory syncytial virus in HeLa cells, the average 50% effective dose of pyrazofurin and 3-deazaguanine for eight strains was 0.07 and 1.65 micrograms/ml, respectively; that of ribavirin was 5.82 micrograms/ml. The cytotoxicity of these compounds for HeLa cells was examined by monitoring the incorporation of radiolabeled uridine into cellular RNA. The selectivity indexes of pyrazofurin and 3-deazaguanine exceeded that of ribavirin by 70- and 11-fold, respectively. Pyrazofurin, 3-deazaguanine, and ribavirin inhibited both viral antigen expression and syncytium formation in HeLa cell cultures, as assessed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. In these assays, pyrazofurin and 3-deazaguanine again proved more potent than ribavirin. 2,5-Diamidinoindole and carbodine were less potent than ribavirin. Various other compounds, i.e., 3-adenin-9-yl-2-hydroxypropanoic acid isobutyl ester, 3-deazauridine, 3'-C-methyluridine, 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, 5-cyanoimidazole-4-carboxamide, and its ribofuranosyl derivative, did not inhibit the cytopathic effect of the Long strain of respiratory syncytial virus at concentrations greater than or equal to 125 micrograms/ml. Tubercidin, 5-chlorotubercidin, xylotubercidin, neplanocin A, thiosemicarbazone R, and 3-methylquercetine were too toxic to HeLa cells for their inhibitory effects on respiratory syncytial virus to be examined.\r"

The inhibitory activity occurred between pH 3 and 5 and was heat stable. Bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli was demonstrated at a dilution of 1:128. The inhibitory substance was distinct from lactic and acetic acids. It had a low molecular weight (less than 1,000) and was soluble in acetone-water (10:1). Because of these characteristics, the inhibitory material could not be considered a bacteriocin; it most closely resembled a microcin, which has been associated previously with members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.\r"

Six users of zinc reported nausea (versus no placebo users), and eight reported an unpleasant taste or aftertaste (versus one placebo user). No benefit was observed among the users of zinc acetate. The mean duration of symptoms in users of the zinc was 12.1 days, compared with 7.7 days in those who used the placebo.

Endomysial antibodies were present in 65% of patients with DH maintained on a normal diet and were absent in those on a gluten-free diet and in those with other diseases and in normal controls. Reticulin antibodies of the IgA class were disease specific for DH and occurred in only 25% of such patients.

IgA-class reticulin antibodies occurred primarily in those patients with DH who had high titers of endomysial antibodies. None of the 20 such patients who were negative for endomysial antibodies had IgA-class reticulin antibodies.

Because the risk of these patients becoming hypertensive is between 10% and 20% and because renin activity may play a part in the pathogenesis of the hypertension, PRA and blood pressure were studied in 98 of the original group after five years of follow up. Two patients could not be traced, and other factors that might influence blood pressure or PRA led us to exclude 13 others, 10 of whom were girls taking oral hormonal contraceptives. Increased PRA was found in 11 of the remaining 85 patients but not in five of the eight patients with increased PRA in the first study. Of eight children identified as hypertensive in the follow up study, only three had had increased PRA five years previously. In normal children PRA decreases with age. In the initial study this tendency was less pronounced in children with renal scars, and in the follow up study it was reversed. This was also confirmed by PRA standard deviation scores, which showed a significant increase in PRA during the five years. PRA tends to rise in patients with pyelonephritic scars as they grow older. There was no direct correlation between blood pressure and PRA, plasma creatinine concentration, or degree of scarring. Analysis of blood pressure standard deviation scores, however, suggested an excessive rise in blood pressure during the five years.\r"

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis reveals similar 2-year survival rates for shunt (65%) and sclerotherapy (61%) groups. Only two of 10 sclerotherapy failures have been salvaged by surgery. Posttherapy quantitative hepatic function, frequency of encephalopathy, and cumulative medical costs were similar for both groups. Hepatic portal perfusion and portal pressure at 1 year were better maintained by sclerotherapy than by distal splenorenal shunt. In conclusion, endoscopic sclerotherapy and shunt surgery provide similar results with respect to survival, hepatic function, frequency of encephalopathy, and costs. Sclerotherapy is an acceptable, but not superior, alternative to shunt surgery for treatment of variceal hemorrhage.\r"

In the first study reported here, small volumes (less than or equal to 12 mL/kg) of 3% NaCl were given to patients who were having surgery for severe injuries. The 3% NaCl restored blood pressure, pH, and urine output with approximately one half of the cumulative fluid requirement of patients who received isotonic fluids (p less than 0.05). In a second study, 7.5% NaCl/dextran 70, 250 mL, was given in a prospective, randomized, and double-blinded trial to injured patients in the field. Blood pressure in the hypertonic/hyperoncotic group increased 49 mmHg during transport (p less than 0.005); blood pressure in patients given lactated Ringer's solution increased 19 mmHg (NS). Survival favored the hypertonic/hyperoncotic group. The 7.5% NaCl/dextran 70 solution appears particularly promising for treatment of injured patients in the field.\r"

  ".W": "Sutureline blood flow was measured with laser Doppler velocimetry in colonic anastomoses created with the stapler, manual suturing, or a combination. Blood flow was always reduced in the sutureline compared with normal mucosa. Of all the anastomoses studied, tight stapling reduced sutureline blood flow the most, whereas the two-layered manual anastomosis or stapling reinforced with sutures were somewhat less ischemic. Stapling adjusted to bowel wall thickness impaired flow only moderately. It was possible with practice to outperform the stapler by single-layered manual anastomosis using fine sutures. In humans, stapled ileocolostomy had a higher sutureline blood flow than the two-layered manual anastomosis. In view of the existing clinical experience of safe stapling without adjustment for bowel wall thickness, a low sutureline blood flow is probably tolerated to a considerable degree in humans. However, this study clearly shows that tight stapling can reduce sutureline blood flow unduly, whereas superior blood supply can be attained by attention to staple closure height relative to bowel wall thickness.\r"

Tetrahydrocortisol is the most potent of the naturally occurring angiostatic steroids. It is a metabolite of cortisone that circulates in the blood, appears in the urine, and was previously believed to be biologically inactive. Both the plasma form and the urinary form are antiangiogenic. The mechanism of action of these steroids depends on their ability to specifically alter basement membrane turnover in growing capillary blood vessels. These steroids represent a prototype of angiogenesis inhibitors that may find potential therapeutic use as adjuncts to anticancer therapy, and in diseases dominated by abnormal neovascularization, i.e., angiogenesis-dependent diseases.\r"

The relationship of patient survival to human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) (A and B loci) compatibility was studied in 164 consecutive cyclosporine-treated patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation between 1980 and 1986 at Stanford University Medical Center. All patients receiving a transplant within this time frame were included except those for whom HLA typing was unavailable. A mismatched antigen was defined as an antigen present in the donor but not in the recipient. The actuarial four-year survival (Cutler-Ederer) for the 19 patients with 0 or 1 mismatch was 88 +/- 8%; for the 39 patients with 2 mismatches, 70 +/- 12%; for the 73 patients with 3 mismatches, 59 +/- 7%; and for the 33 patients with 4 mismatches, 54 +/- 14%. Both actuarial and linear rate analyses revealed no significant correlation between HLA mismatching and rejection rate, likelihood of death from rejection, or length of time to first episode of rejection. Patients with 3 or 4 mismatches had significantly (p less than 0.05) more infections than those with fewer mismatches. By actuarial analysis, a trend toward a higher number of deaths from rejection and infection was observed in the groups with 3 and 4 mismatches, but it did not achieve statistical significance. The data demonstrate that well-matched HLA grafts are associated with better long-term survival and fewer infections in cardiac transplant patients.\r"

In the remaining patients, the repair was carried out by interposing Gore-Tex patches (4 patients) or open tubular grafts (6 patients) using a simplified method, which is described. The 2 deaths, 1 intraoperative and 1 postoperative, were unrelated to the technique. There were no additional perioperative complications. Direct aortic cross-clamping and repair by direct suture or open tubular graft, as described, greatly simplify the correction of acute traumatic rupture of the aorta, and their use is strongly recommended.\r"

Several complex techniques have been designed for its management (e.g., resection of coarctation with either retrograde subclavian flap or carotid subclavian angioplasty). However, residual gradients are frequent. Recently, a new technique of extensive end-to-end anastomosis was described that has the advantages of leaving the left subclavian artery intact and resulting in a wide anastomosis. The present report details a modification of this technique, which more extensively dissects the arch branches and clamps the aortic arch almost 50% of the way across the innominate branch. The descending aorta is mobilized to the diaphragm. Anastomosis is completed with 7-0 PDS or polypropylene sutures. This type of repair has been performed in 7 patients, with a maximum residual gradient at the end of the procedure of 5 mm Hg. These modifications represent an excellent option to the surgeon in the management of this difficult clinical entity.\r"

Blood pressure was lowered from a mean of 189 +/- 2.0/92 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 161 +/- 2.8/78 +/- 1.7 mm Hg with captopril therapy, and therapy with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide produced similar reductions (156 +/- 2.7/78 +/- 1.7 mm Hg). Two patients on triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide therapy withdrew because of side effects, while only minor side effects were observed with captopril therapy. Therapy with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide produced significant elevation of urea, creatinine, and uric acid, while captopril therapy produced no biochemical or hematologic changes. A single daily dose of captopril alone was sufficient to normalize the blood pressure in 31 (75%) of 40 patients. Captopril appears to be a promising monotherapy for the elderly with mild to moderate hypertension.\r"

This article summarizes the results of various studies of BP control: population surveys, assessments of usual practice, worksite programs, large-scale special projects, and quality assurance programs. The evidence suggests that patient characteristics and behaviors explain much of the poor BP control in patients under care. The most important of these patient factors is compliance. However, other factors associated with poor BP control are excessive alcohol intake, life stress, lower income, younger age, black race, male sex, and unmarried state. In evaluating BP control, the clinician and researcher must also be aware of various measurement effects that may lead to erroneously high BP readings.\r"

Among them were 25 with sustained atrial fibrillation and 13 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. All patients were symptomatic and refractory to therapeutic doses of at least two conventional drug trials, and patients with atrial fibrillation had relapsed from electroversion. Amiodarone hydrochloride was administered in doses of 5 mg/kg intravenously, then 600 to 800 mg/d for seven to ten days, followed by 200 to 400 mg/d. Holter recordings were obtained every one to three months. The effect of amiodarone on the ventricular rate during sustained atrial fibrillation was evaluated in 18 patients and decreased from 99/min (range, 72/min to 143/min) at baseline to 75/min (range, 60/min to 102/min) at follow-up before conversion. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm occurred in 19 patients (76%), including 11 with and eight without direct-current cardioversion. During long-term treatment, sinus rhythm was sustained on an average of 16 months (range, three to 27 months) in 20 patients (53%). This included 11 of 25 patients with sustained atrial fibrillation and nine of 13 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with only four of these patients relapsing. Four patients (11%) developed intolerable side effects, but no serious toxic effects were encountered, perhaps because of the relatively low doses of amiodarone hydrochloride that were used (average, 232 +/- 80 mg/d). Amiodarone is a safe and effective alternative to standard therapy in patients with refractory sustained or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\r"

Conservative therapy is generally ineffective and penicillamine therapy can be complicated by serious side effects. To our knowledge, we report the first clinical use of captopril in the treatment of homozygous cystinuria in two siblings. In the first patient, a 70% reduction in cystine excretion was observed after 26 weeks of therapy with 150 mg/d of captopril. Discontinuation of use of the drug resulted in a return to baseline cystine excretion, further loss of renal function, and nephrotic range proteinuria. Repeated treatment with captopril stabilized renal function, reduced proteinuria, and returned cystine excretion to near normal levels. In the second patient, cystine excretion was reduced by 93% after nine weeks of therapy with 75 mg/d of captopril. No adverse side effects were observed in either patient. Formation of the captopril-cysteine disulfide accounts for part of the reduction in cystine excretion but other mechanisms probably contribute. Because captopril-cysteine disulfide is 200 times more soluble than cystine, long-term captopril therapy may be useful in the treatment of cystinuria.\r"

Randomization resulted in two comparable patient groups. Ranitidine treatment was significantly more effective than placebo treatment in decreasing the frequency and the severity of heartburn during both daytime and nighttime assessment periods. There was a significant correlation between improvement in heartburn symptoms and decrease in antacid consumption; hence, patients receiving ranitidine consumed significantly fewer antacid tablets. Among patients with endoscopic esophagitis at baseline, the overall change in endoscopic classification after six weeks of therapy was significantly better for the ranitidine-treated patients. The ranitidine-treated group had less evidence of erosions and ulcerations as well as greater healing. There were no differences between the groups with respect to changes in esophageal mucosal sensitivity to acid perfusion or changes in histologic grading of esophageal mucosal biopsy specimens. The ranitidine safety profile was similar to that of previous studies. We conclude that, in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, ranitidine therapy, 150 mg twice daily, markedly reduced the heartburn symptoms of reflux disease and significantly improved the endoscopic appearance of the esophageal mucosa.\r"

The groups did not differ significantly in most physician characteristics, estimated survival and cure probabilities, importance of most treatment goals, uncertainty about treatment choice, or most attitudinal responses. Although equally involved with and cognizant of the value of clinical trials, the modified radical group expressed more skepticism about the ability of trial results to be transferred to practice and to take sufficient account of patient uniqueness, indicating greater focus on variation than mean results. Trial results might be more readily adopted if they are reported in accessible data-bases, incorporating patient characteristics potentially relevant to treatment choice.

These psychiatric side effects appeared after one to three months of therapy, usually improved within three to four days of decreasing the dose of interferon alfa, and invariably resolved once therapy was stopped. The organic personality and affective syndromes tended to occur in patients who received the highest dose of interferon alfa, who had relatively mild hepatitis, and who lost weight during interferon treatment. Delirium tended to occur in patients with severe hepatitis who had previous evidence of organic brain injury or dysfunction or previous drug and alcohol abuse. Failure to recognize these side effects quickly and to treat them with supportive therapy and modification of the dose of interferon alfa could result in limitation of therapy and serious personal and interpersonal consequences.\r"

The patients presented extensive and symptomatic bone involvement from multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and other metastatic tumors. The treatment consisted of aminohydroxybutylidene diphosphonate, 2.5 mg/d intravenously for five days, or dichloromethylene diphosphonate, 300 mg/d intravenously for seven days, followed by 100 mg/d intramuscularly for ten days. Twelve patients treated with aminohydroxybutylidene diphosphonate and 16 patients treated with dichloromethylene diphosphonate were assessable and were followed up for one to six months. Therapy with aminohydroxybutylidene diphosphonate showed a quicker action in reducing bone pain and reduced significantly more the serum calcium level than did therapy with dichloromethylene diphosphonate. Aminohydroxybutylidene diphosphonate therapy also affected urinary calcium levels and hydroxyproline excretion more markedly than did dichloromethylene diphosphonate, although the differences are not statistically significant. However, the biochemical indexes rebounded more quickly in patients treated with aminohydroxybutylidene diphosphonate, indicating that the loading amount (only 12.5 mg) used in this preliminary study is insufficient to sustain a prolonged effect. The effectiveness and lack of side effects render aminohydroxybutylidene diphosphonate an attractive treatment for malignant bone resorption.\r"

  ".U": "87325310\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1977 and 1985, gentamicin was the only formulary aminoglycoside at the Buffalo Veterans Administration Medical Center. During this time, there was a significant increase in the amount of gentamicin purchased. Amikacin represented 11% or less of the total aminoglycoside purchased in the same period, but purchases of this agent also significantly increased. Because of this long-term use of gentamicin, a retrospective analysis of gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates was performed. The results of this review revealed no significant change in the overall incidence of gram-negative bacteremia; approximately 75% of these bacteremic episodes were hospital acquired. The mean yearly gentamicin-resistance rate of gram-negative blood isolates was 13.2% (range, 6% to 18%) with no significant change in the rate for the period reviewed. However, for certain strains there were fluctuations in the percentage of resistance from year to year, suggesting that clusters of infections due to these organisms had occurred. Bacteremic infection due to resistant organisms was a major contributor to the overall level of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates. Amikacin resistance among gram-negative blood isolates was rare. In conclusion, despite the predominant use of gentamicin there was no change in the gentamicin resistance rate among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates during a nine-year period. The rate of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates appeared to be related to outbreaks/clusters of infections due to resistant strains rather than the frequency of use of gentamicin.\r"

Varying degrees of decreased ionized calcium were observed in all cases and can be attributed to the chelation of calcium by the citrate added during blood transfusions, the inability of the patient to metabolize citrate by the liver during the anahepatic phase of the transplant, and hemodilution of the blood volume with the perfusion prime during venovenous bypass. Calcium chloride was administered when necessary as guided by ionized calcium measurements to restore concentrations to levels that maintain adequate cardiac output. Because of the serious hemodynamic consequences of severe hypocalcemia, regular monitoring of ionized calcium concentration is necessary during this procedure. Total calcium levels are not reliable for this because they do not reflect the extent of anion binding.\r"

Six (6.4%) men had severe atherosclerosis (75% to 90% cross-sectional area luminal narrowing) in one or more coronary arteries; five of the six had fibrous plaques, and one had a complicated plaque. Our prevalence is similar to that reported previously (5%). Therefore, to determine whether the decrease in the incidence of severe coronary atherosclerosis today is the result of decreased plaque formation in the young, we will need to examine at least 772 men to detect a 50% decline with 85% to 90% confidence.\r"

Of 245 total deaths, a slide and chart review of all 116 autopsied cases (47%) identified the major causes of death as pneumonia (n = 43), sepsis (n = 32), hemorrhage (n = 15), peritonitis (n = 11), meningitis (n = 7), and pulmonary embolism (n = 5). Eighty-five (73.3%) of these patients died of complications directly associated with immunosuppression, almost all (n = 82) as a result of infection. Organisms most frequently identified at death were gram-negative bacilli (n = 72), Candida species (n = 23), cytomegalovirus (n = 17), enterococcus (n = 14), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 11), Aspergillus species (n = 10), Pneumocystis carinii (n = 5), and mycobacteria (n = 5). Significant associations were found between bolus steroid antirejection therapy and infection with Aspergillus cytomegalovirus. Diabetics had a higher incidence of fungal infections and bowel perforation than nondiabetics. During this 20-year period, overall one-year actual patient survival rates for the four respective five-year intervals increased dramatically (69.9%, 68.2%, 83.3%, and 91.8%), but the normalized death rate showed a smaller decrease for infectious vs noninfectious causes.\r"

The underlying cytotrophoblast was negative for these same serum proteins. In the hydatidiform mole, these findings were profoundly different. The syncytiotrophoblast lost its immunoreactivity to albumin, IgG, transferrin, and, less frequently, to alpha 1-AT. Furthermore, the underlying cytotrophoblast became immunoreactive to albumin, alpha 1-AT, IgG, transferrin, ferritin, orosomucoid, and, sometimes, to alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. This altered immunohistochemical pattern suggested a notable change in the pinocytotic activity of the trophoblast in the placenta during molar degeneration. The absence of pinocytosis in the syncytiotrophoblast for several proteins can be explained by the partial loss of specific membrane receptors. The contemporaneous appearance of numerous serum proteins in the cytotrophoblast could indicate an activation, not only proliferative, but also functional, in the germinative cytotrophoblast. Diagnostically, this histochemical finding in the hydatidiform mole, which was quite different from that seen in normal placentas during the first trimester of pregnancy, could provide additional evidence concerning trophoblastic abnormalities in the chorionic villi during molar degeneration.\r"

Renal biopsy was performed on four of the siblings (three brothers and the sister). Renal tissue from all three brothers who underwent biopsy showed similar glomerular lesions, characterized by striking cloverleaf expansion of glomerular lobules by an acellular hyaline material and segmental mesangial cell proliferation. Electron microscopy showed massive mesangial and subendothelial deposits and occasional areas of glomerular basement membrane splitting with round inclusions. The renal biopsy specimen of the sister was normal on light and electron microscopy and negative for immunoglobulins and complement on immunofluorescent staining. Immunofluorescence microscopy on one of the male siblings was negative for immunoglobulins and complement. No other physical or serologic abnormalities could be established. To our knowledge, this is a unique form of familial glomerulopathy that has not been previously described.\r"

The value of intermediate filament typing in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell tumors of the urinary bladder is discussed, and a review of the literature on the subject is presented. It is postulated that the retained capacity for continued differentiation displayed by this tumor may account for the relatively better prognosis observed for this patient.\r"

Most cloacal-derived tissues were tested with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against hCG and subunits. The previously described hCG-like positivity was found to be exclusively related to the free alpha-subunit of hCG. Moreover, alpha-chain immunoreactivity was more broadly distributed in most cloacal-derived tissues, including those from the anal canal. In the anal canal, alpha-chain was an excellent marker of the anal transitional zone. alpha-Chain-immunoreactive endocrine cells were normal and nonneoplastic constituents of these tissues; they corresponded to a subpopulation of serotonin cells. In addition, certain prostatic argyrophil cell carcinomas might be exclusively alpha-subunit producing.\r"

The presence of cytokeratin and EMA in chordoma implies the epithelial nature of the tumor and is extremely helpful as a differential marker for chordoma.

Ovarian cancer treated by a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy was the most frequent underlying disease of 20 patients (58%) followed by carcinoma of the cervix (eight [24%] of the patients). The median latent period between irradiation and surgery was eight months after the combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy, and 12 months after radiotherapy alone. Thirty operations (81%) were done for small-bowel stricture, four for fistula, and three for perforation. Bypass was performed in 17 patients and resection in 16. Complications (fistula, peritonitis, perforation) occurred after 13 operations (35%). All three patients who developed peritonitis died (mortality, 8.1%): two after resection and one after bypass. Suture-associated complications occurred in three (23%) of 13 cases after single-layer and in three (35%) of 17 cases after two-layer anastomoses. Ten patients are still alive two to 76 months (median, 32 months) after operation, six of them free of tumor. All are underweight and suffer from diarrhea (four to 12 stools per day). Pernicious anemia developed in all six patients surviving more than two years.\r"
