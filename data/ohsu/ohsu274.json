A total of 572 newborn infants who met these criteria were randomly allocated to one of two groups. All infants underwent oropharyngeal suctioning with a DeLee catheter while the head was still on the perineum. In group I (n = 308) suctioning of the trachea under direct vision was performed instantly at birth; in group II (n = 264) this procedure was not done. There was no mortality among infants in the study, but morbidity, mainly pulmonary and laryngeal disorders, occurred in six of 308 group I infants and in none of the group II infants (P less than 0.025). Immediate tracheal suction is not a harmless intervention, and should be considered superfluous in a vigorous term neonate born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid.\r"

Pulmonary mechanics, mechanical power of breathing, and VO2 were measured at the beginning and end of each study period. In the placebo group, all infants had elevated VO2 (7.4 +/- 1.4 mL/kg/min) and carbon dioxide production (6.6 +/- 1.2 mL/kg/min), increased airway resistance (59 +/- 30 cm H2O/L/sec), decreased dynamic compliance (0.073 +/- 0.024 mL/cm H2O/cm), increase respiratory rate (52 +/- 11), and increased mechanical power of breathing (2.22 +/- 1.05 kg.cm/kg/min). Treatment with theophylline, diuretics, and theophylline plus diuretics resulted in a significant improvement in pulmonary mechanics and mechanical power of breathing, but not in VO2. These results suggest that the increased VO2 in infants with BPD is not secondary to increased mechanical power of breathing.\r"

  ".W": "To test whether polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) might be associated with protection against oxygen toxicity in newborn experimental animals, we performed two series of experiments. In the first series, adult female rats were fed one of three diets--regular Rat Chow, a high-PUFA (safflower oil-based) diet, or a low-PUFA (palm oil-based) diet--for several weeks before and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Newborn offspring of the three diet groups had similar antioxidant enzyme activities and surfactant development. Offspring of dams fed the high-PUFA diet had total lung lipid fatty acids characterized by increased linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6) and arachidonic acid (20:4 omega 6) and a significantly increased PUFA/saturated fatty acid ratio, compared with offspring of dams fed the regular diet or low-PUFA diet; associated with this increased PUFA pattern was markedly superior survival (80 of 84 (95%) vs 56 of 84 (67%) for regular-diet offspring, P less than 0.01) after 7 days in greater than 95% oxygen. Conversely, offspring born to dams fed the low-PUFA diet had decreased lung PUFA content and inferior tolerance to prolonged high O2 exposure (survival 38 of 84 (45%)). In the second experimental series, the postnatal provision of high PUFA rat milk to offspring born to dams fed the low-PUFA diet (via \"cross-nurturing\" by high-PUFA diet dams) rapidly increased their lung lipid PUFA and improved their hyperoxic survival (44 of 50 vs 25 of 50 for low-PUFA diet newborn animals kept with their low-PUFA mother rats, P less than 0.01). These studies suggest that increasing lung lipid PUFA can confer a protective effect against the toxic effects of hyperoxia on the newborn animal lung.\r"

Mean birth weight of the infants was 829 +/- 217 g, mean gestational age at birth was 26.6 +/- 2.9 weeks, and mean postnatal age at the start of therapy was 2.4 +/- 1.0 weeks. Serial determinations of furosemide pharmacokinetic parameters were performed during 2 weeks to 3 months of long-term therapy. Plasma half-life was prolonged in infants less than 31 weeks postconceptional age (gestational + postnatal age), frequently exceeding 24 hours. All infants less than 29 weeks postconceptional age whose dosing schedule was once every 12 hours accumulated furosemide to potentially ototoxic levels. Furosemide renal clearance increased and plasma half-life decreased in association with increasing postconceptional age. Furosemide secretory clearance was very low in patients less than 31 weeks postconceptional age, resulting in a reliance on glomerular filtration to deliver drug to its main site of action within the lumen of the loop of Henle. Thus elevated plasma levels may be required to ensure adequate luminal delivery and adequate diuresis in these infants with low secretory clearance. Nevertheless, the current dosing schedule (once every 12 hours) of furosemide should be modified to once every 24 hours in infants of low postconceptional age to avoid possible toxic effects.\r"

The mean +/- SD enprofylline serum elimination half-life was 1.06 +/- 0.20 hours, considerably shorter than the half-life reported in adults. The mean steady-state volume of distribution was 0.55 +/- 0.05 L/kg. The mean clearance rate was 0.44 +/- 0.06 L/hr/kg. The mean enprofylline serum concentration at steady state was 1.7 +/- 0.5 mg/L. The mean peak to trough ratio was 3.02 +/- 1.31. On the first and ninth study days, 87% +/- 8% and 90% +/- 16%, respectively, of the dose of enprofylline was recovered as unchanged drug in the urine.

Salicylate bioavailability was impaired during the acute phase of the disease (47.7% +/- 6.6%), and increased significantly thereafter to 75.1% +/- 9.3%. During the febrile phase there was a significant correlation between salicylate bioavailability and steady-state serum concentrations. Salicylate renal clearance was significantly higher during the febrile phase (14.45 +/- 2.5 mL/kg.h), compared with the nonfebrile phase (7 +/- 1.6 mL/kg.h, P less than 0.05). The change in salicylate clearance could be explained by decreased protein binding in the acute phase (82.5% +/- 1.9%) with substantially more free salicylates caused by significantly lower serum albumin concentrations. Changes in urine metabolites during the acute and subacute phases were consistent with the changes in dose administered (100 mg/kg in the acute phase vs 10 mg/kg in the subacute phase). The pattern of metabolites excreted in the urine of children with Kawasaki disease receiving 100 mg/kg was similar to that in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis receiving the same dose.\r"

Due to additional antenatal complications, of which 8.0% were hypertension and/or diabetes, 48.4% of the postdate pregnancies were classified as at risk. As expected, high-risk women experienced a higher incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes than did low-risk women. The incidence of meconium staining, low five-minute Apgar scores and perinatal mortality increased beyond term and was found most commonly in infants from high-risk pregnancies, especially those involving hypertension and diabetes mellitus. These results suggest that high-risk pregnancies probably should not enter the postdate period since their doing so places the infant at serious risk.\r"

  ".W": "In order to obtain information necessary for optimum delivery of services, data were collected on the nature of the services provided at a family planing clinic. Clinic visits were divided into initial, annual, routine, problem, supply, educational and unknown. An analysis of the \"problem\" visits was undertaken to assess various epidemiologic aspects of such visits and to identify areas of clinic efficiency that could be improved. Problem visits were defined as any visits for which the patient had a presenting complaint. Age, level of education, method of contraception and parity were statistically associated with problem visits. When compared to Pill users, diaphragm users, intrauterine device users and non-users had a higher-than-expected number of problem visits. Less educated women and teenagers had a lower-than-expected number of problem visits when compared to more educated and older women. Socioeconomic status and problem visits were not statistically associated. Problem visits required more time, utilized more medical services and resulted in more referrals to the gynecology clinic than did other visit types. As a result of this analysis, we have increased our educational efforts for patients at high risk of problem visits and have instituted a special problem-oriented family planning clinic in which a full complement of house staff and ancillary personnel are available. This arrangement makes the uncomplicated family planning clinic run more smoothly and efficiently and obviates the need for time-consuming and cost-ineffective referrals.\r"

These women were evaluated before and three months after surgery with multichannel urodynamic testing. Forty percent of the 50 women with prior incontinence surgery remained incontinent after the cystourethropexy even though 94% of them had undergone anatomic correction. This result was not statistically different from the 28% failure rate in patients without prior incontinence surgery. Forty-two percent of the 62 women who had previously undergone hysterectomy failed cystourethropexy despite anatomic correction in 95%. This finding was significantly different from the 17% failure rate in women without prior hysterectomy (P less than .025). This retrospective analysis suggests that prior hysterectomy may place women at increased risk of continued incontinence following cystourethropexy despite anatomic correction of urethrovesical junction descent. Contrary to the results of other investigators, women with prior incontinence surgery in this study were not found to be at significantly greater risk of incontinence after cystourethropexy.\r"

Those patients with other infertility factors were included in the study only if the factors were correctable and ultimately determined to be noncontributory. Life-table analysis was used to compare pregnancy rates between the two groups over a 12-month period that started immediately after laparoscopy in the untreated group and after completion of danazol therapy in the treated group. The cumulative pregnancy rate (+/- SEM) was 37.2 +/- 8.4% in the danazol group (n = 37) and 57.4 +/- 10.4% in the untreated group (n = 36) (NS, P greater than .10). This prospective, randomized study showed danazol to be ineffective in improving pregnancy rates over doing nothing at all in patients with minimal endometriosis.\r"

The risk factors of age, duration of infertility, size and number of fibroids, and menorrhagia did not appear to influence the success rate or increase the complication rate.

We found that the endometrium was maintained in an inactive phase in 100% of the women given continuous daily progestin but in only 25% of those given cyclic progestin. Bleeding occurred in 100% of subjects given cyclic progestin and in 50% of those given continuous progestin; however, bleeding episodes diminished with time in those on continuous progestin. A hormonal regimen that leads to reduced or absent bleeding and an inactive endometrium is preferable for postmenopausal women if estrogen therapy is to be used for the long term after menopause.\r"

To characterize the ultrastructural details of the synovial cells of these mice, knee joints from MRL/1, MRL/n, and BALB/c mice were examined by light and electron microscopy. Since the proliferating synovial cells of MRL/1 mice resemble the previously described proliferative synovial cells seen in histopathologic specimens from early rheumatoid arthritis, further study of these cells may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of early joint tissue destruction in human rheumatic disease.\r"

Inhibition of zymosan stimulated O2- release was only attributable in a minor degree to inhibition of expression of surface receptors (MO-1), and appeared to be mainly due to inhibitory effects on more distal components of the activation pathway.

Eighteen patients completed at least 3 months' treatment. Six of the 7 patients with early RA (less than 3 years) improved; their median erythrocyte sedimentation rate fell from 43.5-10 mm/h (p = 0.036) and median serum C-reactive protein from 40-0 mg/l (p = 0.036). Eleven patients with longer histories of RA did not improve. Our results suggest rifampicin with or without isoniazid may be effective in RA.\r"

Sucrose gradient sedimentation shows that in the absence of photosensitization, the interaction of procainamide with DNA did not modify DNA sedimentation in alkaline or neutral sucrose gradients. In contrast, when a photosensitized DNA procainamide mixture was placed on sucrose gradients, the peak appearing on alkaline sucrose gradient after treatment with endonuclease was shifted toward the lower molecular weights, indicating that strand breaks had developed in the photosensitized procainamide DNA. Incubation of a [32P] labeled photosensitized procainamide-DNA complex with a repair endonuclease and DNA polymerase I released the label in the acid soluble fraction, indicating that only the photosensitized procainamide-DNA complex was susceptible to the endonucleolytic attack. There was only negligible release of the label in the acid soluble fraction without exposure of the DNA-procainamide mixture to light. The incorporation into DNA of [3H]-TTP (tritium labeled triphosphates) in presence of DNA polymerase I was inhibited when the photosensitized procainamide-DNA complex was used as substrate. However, after treatment of the photosensitized DNA complex with the repair endonuclease, the incorporation of [3H]-TTP was increased and reached values close to that observed with DNA unexposed to light, suggesting that the endonuclease functions as a repair enzyme.\r"

In 4 of 6 antiphospholipid antibodies, an inverse association with renal disease was observed.

Further studies are needed to determine how many antibody families cause these activities and to elucidate whether certain SLE subgroups possess differing specificities for each of the phospholipids.\r"

The presence of aCL was associated with lupus anticoagulant activity (p less than 0.001), positive VDRL (p less than 0.05), and lower mean platelet counts (p less than 0.05) and C3 levels (p less than 0.05). Both aCL and lupus anticoagulant activity were associated with positive Coombs' (p less than 0.01) and low C4 (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). Analysis of red blood cell (RBC) eluates and absorption studies using fixed RBC suggested that some aCL may act as anti-RBC antibodies, likely directed at membrane phospholipid epitopes. Furthermore, we hypothesize that complement may participate as a cofactor maximizing lupus anticoagulant activity.\r"

IgM containing fractions were prepared by chromatography and assayed for hidden RF by the hemolytic method and ELISA. Ten patients were seropositive by LFT. All of them gave positive tests on the serum for RF with the SCAT, nephelometry, and ELISA, and on the IgM containing fractions by the hemolytic assay and ELISA. Seventeen patients seronegative by LFT were positive for hidden RF by the hemolytic test and ELISA on the IgM containing fraction. When unfractionated serum was used, 15 were positive by ELISA. Three patients were seronegative and also negative for hidden RF by the hemolytic assay and ELISA. Thus, only 2 of 30 patients had discordant results between the hemolytic assay on the IgM containing fraction and the ELISA on the serum. Our results indicate the ELISA on the serum in conjunction with the LFT offers a simple, rapid, alternative test for hidden 19S IgM RF in JRA patients.\r"

However, the growth of advanced subcutaneous tumors, arising from inoculation of either the original in vivo LL line or a tissue culture-adapted cell line (LLTC) derived from the LL line was delayed significantly by FAA treatment. Comparison, by clonogenic survival assays, of the cytotoxic effect of FAA on LLTC cells demonstrated that most cell killing occurred between 2 and 8 hours following in vivo exposure but occurred to a much lesser extent and at later times following in vitro exposure. FAA was inactive against LLTC cells growing in vivo in diffusion chambers, suggesting that a host cellular component was necessary for activity. FAA was found to induce hemorrhagic necrosis in the advanced LL tumors, as well as in a number of human tumor xenografts growing in athymic mice. The human cell lines from which the xenografts were derived, as well as the LL tumor lines and P388 leukemia lines, were inhibited by FAA in vitro. However, the ranking of FAA activity in vivo did not parallel that observed in vitro. Together, these observations strongly suggest that FAA has an indirect mode of antitumor action.\r"

For exploration of the potential clinical importance of this observation, the effects of administering the combination of chlorpromazine and bleomycin in vitro and in vivo against the transplantable B16 melanoma were studied. The toxicity of the combination to bone marrow and lungs was also determined. Combined chlorpromazine and bleomycin therapy reduced the concentration of chlorpromazine required to inhibit cellular growth of B16 melanoma cells by greater than half (25 vs. 60 microM). Against the transplanted tumor, after 3 weeks of treatment the tumor sizes (in cubic millimeters) were 540 +/- 100 (vehicle), 520 +/- 120 (chlorpromazine), 170 +/- 10 (bleomycin), and 80 +/- 20 (bleomycin + chlorpromazine, P less than .01 vs. bleomycin alone). The median time required to reach a tumor size of 100 mm3 was 15 days for vehicle and chlorpromazine, 17 days for bleomycin, and 26 days for chlorpromazine and bleomycin together. The doubling time of the tumor was also increased 3.5-fold above control with the two-drug combination. At doses of bleomycin and chlorpromazine that increased antitumor activity, no pulmonary fibrosis, measured histologically and biochemically, was detected. At higher doses of bleomycin, the addition of chlorpromazine diminished lung fibrosis. The combination of drugs was not more toxic to hematopoietic precursors than chlorpromazine alone. These studies suggested that the addition of a phenothiazine to bleomycin can augment the therapeutic efficacy of bleomycin in vivo without substantially increasing its toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of a low methionine intake on the chemopreventive efficacy of selenomethionine versus selenite was compared in the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced mammary tumor model in rats. Animals were fed from weaning a purified 20% casein diet with or without 0.3% methionine supplementation. Selenomethionine or selenite, at a final concentration of 3 ppm of selenium (Se), was added to the diet starting 5 days after DMBA administration. Control rats continued to receive the basal diets which contained 0.1 ppm of Se. Results of the carcinogenesis experiment indicated that suboptimal dietary methionine significantly reduced the protective effect of selenomethionine in cancer prevention. In contrast, the efficacy of selenite was not affected. In rats given 3 ppm of selenomethionine, tissue Se was actually higher in those fed a diet with a suboptimal amount of methionine than in those with an adequate intake of methionine. On the other hand, dietary methionine did not influence the level of tissue Se in animals given selenite. An increase of dietary methionine to 0.6% did not enhance the efficacy of selenomethionine in cancer protection but would allow the use of a higher level of selenite without the accompanying adverse effects. The biological significance of Se utilization under suboptimal or adequate methionine intake was also assessed using the glutathione peroxidase assay in the liver of Se-deficient rats given graded levels of Se as either selenite or selenomethionine. The enzyme study demonstrated that low dietary methionine decreased the nutritional biopotency of selenomethionine in restoring glutathione peroxidase activity but not that of selenite. These experiments suggest that adequate methionine intake is required for the utilization of selenomethionine for nutritional and anticarcinogenic purposes.\r"

Epithelial cells in the villi of small intestine, colon, and stomach were rich in the P-glycoprotein gene transcript. Observations were consistent with the idea that the P-glycoprotein plays a role in detoxification by pumping potentially harmful compounds into the lumen of digestive tracts in animals.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-one consecutive patients with advanced breast cancer (defined as metastatic disease) and 20 normal age- and sex-matched controls were admitted to a prospective study designed to assess muscle electrophysiology. Nutritional status, lean body mass, and ultrasonographic measurement of the triceps brachialis, sternomastoid, and adductor pollicis muscles were determined in patients and controls. In addition, tumor mass and performance status were determined in the patient group. Electrophysiology of the adductor pollicis muscle was assessed during isometric voluntary maximum effort and during electrical stimulation via the ulnar nerve (80-120 V, 50-100 msec). Nutritional status, lean body mass, and ultrasonographic measurements of the triceps brachialis, sternomastoid, and adductor pollicis were not significantly different between patients and controls. Maximum strength after supramaximal stimulation at 50 Hz was 34 +/- 15 N in patients, versus 40 +/- 9 (P less than .01) N in controls. Relaxation velocity was 336 +/- 149 N/sec in patients, versus 507 +/- 251 (P = .02) N/sec in controls. Fatigue (% of initial strength after 30 sec of stimulation) was 67% +/- 22% in patients, versus 79% +/- 17% (P = .03) in controls. Muscle electrophysiology did not correlate with tumor mass or performance status. It was concluded that patients with advanced breast cancer have abnormal muscle electrophysiology that is not due to abnormal nutritional status or decreased muscle mass. More research is needed to better characterize this disorder and to better define its cause.\r"

It proved useful in patients with bleeding from a large surface area or from deep parenchymal injuries, even those extending into the hilum. No deaths occurred in the splenic salvage patients. There was no difference in postoperative complications among the splenectomy, conventional splenorraphy, or mesh wrap splenorraphy groups. However, workup of persistent postoperative fevers in two splenic wrap patients revealed perisplenic fluid collections on CT scan. Aspiration yielded sterile fluid. Possible cause and effect relationship is being studied in the dog lab. We conclude that splenic wrapping is both a safe and efficacious method of splenic preservation.\r"

Of 479 trauma patients (80% of the total) who were followed for a full year, 57% had no activity restrictions, 16% had some limitation with either a major or minor physical activity, but did not have any difficulty with mobility or self care, and 27% were limited in either mobility or one of the five basic self-care activities. Further analyses show that of the 262 individuals who were working full-time before the injury, 57% had actually returned to full-time employment within the year. Factors in addition to type and severity of trauma that influence return to work were higher educational level, white collar employment, higher preinjury income, and the presence of supportive individuals among family or friends. Recovery as defined by functional status and return to full-time work is analyzed by body region and severity of the principal injury sustained.\r"

Seventy-five per cent of the injuries were caused by motor vehicle accidents, with the remainder due to falls (17%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (4%), altercations (2%), or falling objects (2%). The Injury Severity Score (ISS) averaged 32 +/- 14 S.D. in all survivors versus 60 +/- 14 S.D. in those who died. Eighty-three patients (58%) required mechanical ventilation. Thirty-six patients died (25%). Isolated pulmonary contusion or flail chest had a mortality of 16% each. However, the mortality more than doubled when there was a combined pulmonary contusion and flail chest (42%). More than half of all deaths were directly attributed to central nervous system injuries with another third due to massive hemorrhage. Factors that were associated with a higher morbidity and mortality included severe associated thoracic injuries, a high ISS, the presence of shock, falls from heights, and the combination of pulmonary contusion and flail chest.\r"

This study examined the influence of physiologic, injury site, and injury mechanism criteria on the diagnosis of major trauma in 2,057 trauma patients. Because the Trauma Score was found to be a highly specific indicator of major trauma (98.7%), the strategy adopted for isolating the factors that minimize inappropriate triage was to determine which, alone or in combination, are the most effective in identifying patients with major trauma among those with high Trauma Scores (greater than 12). Based on this analysis, a set of triage guidelines was developed. The application of these guidelines to the study population indicated an undertriage rate of 4.1 to 6.3% and an overtriage rate of 16.8 to 21.3%, depending on the definition of major trauma.\r"

A preoperative emergency center arteriogram was performed in 63.2% of patients, and physical examination alone prompted operation in 36.8%. Eight patients underwent immediate amputation; the remaining 212 patients were found to have 225 arterial (63.9%) and 127 venous (36.1%) injuries. More than 50% of patients were noted to have both arterial and venous injuries. Arterial repair was most commonly accomplished by segmental resection with an end-to-end anastomosis (28.4%) or insertion of a graft (38.8%). Venous repair was most commonly accomplished by lateral venorrhaphy (48.8%), ligation (19.7%), or insertion of a conduit (18.1%).

Twenty-two arterial injuries were repaired, the majority (17) by saphenous vein bypass. Three tibial vessels were ligated. All major venous injuries were repaired. No synthetic material was used. Vascular repair took precedence in all but two cases. After repair, the vascular surgeon assisted with stabilization. Thirteen limbs required fasciotomy; nine required subsequent debridements and later plastic reconstruction. Limb salvage was 96%. More important, 21 patients can ambulate independently on the injured extremity (84%).

Thirty four per cent of the patients had no peritoneal drainage and an abscess rate of 1.8%, 18% had only closed suction drainage and 0% abscess rate, 15% had only open sump drainage and a rate of 8.3%, 14% had only open Penrose drainage with a rate of 8.7%, and 19% had a combination of both open Penrose and sump drainage with a rate of 22.5%. Certain findings or conditions were related to the development of postoperative sepsis. Gunshot wounds were associated with a 9.9% abscess rate, blunt trauma with 3.8%, and stabbings with 0%. Patients who presented in shock were at a threefold increased risk for intra-abdominal abscess formation, those who needed blood transfusions of greater than 6 units were at a tenfold increased risk, those with major liver injuries were at a sixfold increased risk, and those with a total of three or more abdominal organs injured were at a threefold increased risk for abscess formation. There was no significant relation between presence of gastrointestinal perforation and subsequent abscess formation. For patients without the specific risk factors mentioned above, the probability of developing an intra-abdominal abscess is low. This group of patients would therefore benefit little from the presence of a drain, but might very well be harmed by the introduction of external contaminant bacteria into the peritoneal cavity by the drain itself.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During ongoing flow cytometric studies of burned patient blood leukocytes, it was noted frequently that large numbers of granulocytes were present along with the mononuclear cells at the plasma/Ficoll-Hypaque (F-H) interface following centrifugation over F-H. Since differential WBC counts are not routinely performed on F-H interface cells, it is possible that many previous immunologic studies of burned patients have greatly overestimated numbers of lymphocytes recovered. The present study sought to quantify the extent to which granulocyte contamination of F-H separated cells occurs following burn injury. Blood from 15 thermally injured patients (7-55% total body surface area burn) was studied serially at 24 hr, 48 hr, and weekly thereafter through 6 weeks postburn (PB). Controls were age-matched normals (No. of control bloods = 59). Three-part differential cell counts (lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes) were performed on both F-H interface cells and RBC-lysed whole blood. Counts were performed by light scatter analysis on a flow cytometer. Except at 48 hr, at every time studied through 4 weeks PB, there was significant contamination of F-H interface cells with granulocytes. At 24 hr PB, 41 +/- 9% of the interface cells were granulocytes while at 4 weeks, PB 24 +/- 8% of the interface cells were granulocytes. The data did not support the interpretation that this increase in F-H interface granulocytes was simply reflective of the granulocytosis commonly observed after burn. Thus artificial generation of granulocytosis by addition of extra normal leukocytes to normal blood resulted in complete separation of granulocytes from mononuclear cells following centrifugation over F-H.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This paper describes such a study, made possible by two recent developments: first, the availability of a large data file, the Fatal Accident Reporting System, which gives information on more than one third of a million people fatally injured in traffic crashes; second, a new technique, the double-pair comparison method, which, by focusing on vehicles containing two occupants, at least one of whom is killed, allows appropriate inferences to be made from such data. Fatality risk versus sex and age was determined for ten categories of vehicle occupants (unbelted car drivers, helmeted motorcycle passengers, etc.). Similar effects were found for different occupants, indicating that basic physiologic response (not confined to traffic fatalities) is being measured. It is found that fatality risk is about 25% greater for females than for similar aged males from about age 15 to 45 years. At younger and older ages males are more at risk. For both sexes, fatality risk is least at age 20 years. At age 70 it is about three times what it is at age 20.\r"

To avoid this problem we investigated the presence of the fat embolism syndrome in patients with an 'isolated' fracture of the femoral shaft. Two groups were distinguished: those who had an open fracture or a closed fracture treated operatively within 24 hours after the accident (decompression group), and those who were treated initially conservatively (nondecompressed group). Clinical fat embolism occurred only in patients in the nondecompressed group (3.5%). They showed significantly higher initial temperatures, lower pulse rates, a progressive hemoglobin decrease, and a fracture localization more proximal (p less than 0.025) than the other patients in the nondecompressed group; they also showed significantly different pathophysiologic patterns from the patients in the decompressed group. Although the pathophysiologic mechanism of the onset of clinical fat embolism remains unclear, initial temperature elevations in combination with 'typical' fracture localization and fracture type appear to have a predictive value.\r"

Of the 25 survivors who responded to the questionnaires, 44% reported either inability to return to work or substantial interference with daily living due to their injuries. Inexperience riding the vehicle, prior use of alcohol, and lack of protective riding apparel were frequently cited as contributing factors in these injuries.\r"

The energy level at the moment of trauma and the cervical sagittal spinal canal size are of great importance for the survival prognosis and also probably for the genesis of various degrees of neurologic deficits.\r"

Mean age was 8.2 years and mortality was 3.5%. Mean I.S.S. of survivors was 8.1 in comparison to 59.7 for nonsurvivors. Linear regression coefficient determined from analysis of these variables produced a slope of -3.7 with a statistically significant correlation of P.T.S. to I.S.S. (p less than 0.001; r2 = 0.89). Analysis of the mortality for each cohort of patients with the same P.T.S. identified three categories of mortality potential. Children whose P.T.S. was greater than 8 had a 0% mortality. Children whose P.T.S. was between 0 and 8 had an increasing mortality related to their decreasing P.T.S. (r2 = 0.86), and children whose P.T.S. was below 0 had 100% mortality. This study documents the direct linear relationship between P.T.S. and injury severity, and confirms the P.T.S. as an effective predictor of both severity of injury and potential for mortality.\r"

Standardized courses for first-hour management (ATLAS) have been widely accepted. A teaching format based upon video recording of every resuscitation has been developed. Tapes are reviewed by the staff and by the individuals involved in a particular resuscitation. In a weekly resuscitation review conference, actual footage is presented to the trauma team members, specific aspects of a resuscitation are critiqued, and supplemental didactic information is presented. Legal problems have been avoided by making the review and conference a part of the quality assurance process. Patient anonymity is preserved by positioning the video camera at the foot of the resuscitation bed. Tapes are erased after each conference. Video recording allows analysis of: 1) priorities during the resuscitation; 2) cognitive integration of the workup by the team leader; 3) physical integration of the workup by the team leader; 4) team member adherence to assigned responsibilities, resuscitation time, errors or breaks in technique; and 5) behavior change over time. In 3 1/2 years, more than 2,500 resuscitations have been recorded. Over a 3-month period, average resuscitation time to definitive care decreased for age- and injury severity-matched patient groups cared for by one team. Resuscitations have become more efficient and adherence to assigned responsibilities better. Weekly review of resuscitation contributes to improved technique and trauma care.\r"

Twenty-five patients in Group I (40%) had a measureable pulse and/or blood pressure when EMS personnel arrived at the scene and subsequently \"died\" before their arrival at the trauma center. RT was also uniformly unsuccessful in this subgroup. Eighteen patients in Group I (29%) suffered cardiac arrest following their arrival at the hospital. Three of these patients (16.6%) were successfully resuscitated and two (11%) survived to leave the hospital. There were four traumatic full arrests in Group II (40%) and all four died.

Bed rest in the control group led to increases in hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red cell DPG and ATP levels, and plasma concentrations of total proteins, globulins, and fibrinogen, with attendant increases in whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, blood viscosity, relative blood viscosity with hematocrit adjusted to 45%, and viscometric aggregation index, and the viscosity of red cell suspensions in Ringer's solution at 45% hematocrit decreased at low shear rate. The patient group, despite the postoperative lowering of their hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and total plasma proteins and a consequent decrease of whole blood viscosity, revealed disproportionate increases in blood viscosity, relative blood viscosity, and viscometric aggregation index. These rheologic changes, which reflect an enhanced red cell aggregability, may contribute to complications of thrombophlebitis. Enforced inactivity, when superimposed on the effects of trauma, blood loss, transfusion with bank blood, and the low-flow state, would exaggerate these rheologic problems. The results suggest that management of total hip replacement patients should include hemorrheologic considerations (e.g., preoperative intentional hemodilution) and early postoperative activity.\r"

Twelve underwent nonpenetrating cardiac impact alone at 12 m/sec with a contact compression of 2 cm. Eleven underwent cardiac impact after having received intravenous alcohol (blood level of 197 +/- 37 mg/100 ml) (mean +/- SD). Three dogs experienced ventricular fibrillation immediately after impact and died: of these, two underwent impact alone and one underwent impact following ethanol. These three dogs were eliminated from the study. All of the dogs had some form of complex arrhythmia during the first 10 minutes of observation, the average cumulative duration of which during the first 10 minutes following trauma was greater among dogs that received ethanol. No complex arrhythmias other than ventricular premature contractions or ventricular tachycardia were observed after the first 10 minutes following impact. During the first 2 hours of observation following cardiac impact, dogs that received alcohol before trauma showed more single premature ventricular contractions (p less than 0.03), couplets (p less than 0.01), triplets (p less than 0.02), runs of 4-20 beats (p less than 0.05), and total number of premature ventricular contractions (p less than 0.05) than dogs that underwent trauma alone. Following the first 10 minutes, ventricular irritability increased with time until approximately 1 hour, and then there was a gradual reduction of the frequency of arrhythmias in both dogs that received alcohol and those that did not. In conclusion, nonpenetrating cardiac impact in dogs that previously received ethanol was associated with greater ventricular irritability than in dogs that underwent impact alone.\r"

The relationships between initial ICP and GCS, between initial ICP and GOS, between maximal ICP and GCS, and between maximal ICP and GOS were examined statistically. The correlation was significant in each case, but particularly so between maximal ICP and GOS. Thus morbidity and mortality may be dependent upon maximal ICP. Catheterization of the subarachnoid space presents little difficulty using a Tuohy needle for epidural anesthesia as an introducer. Though the catheter is very fine (1.0 mm in outer diameter), failure of waveform occurred in only 2.1% of all patients. The procedure can be easily performed at the bedside, is safe, inexpensive, and useful for the management of severe head injuries. Meningitis was recognized in 4.7% of all patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acute head injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage on the cardiovascular system (CVS) are well known, but data are lacking on the effects of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) on the CVS. The clip compression SCI rat model was used to measure changes in the mean systemic arterial pressure (mSAP), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), total peripheral resistance (TPR), and central venous pressure (CVP) after SCI. Three groups of five animals each were anesthetized with chloralose-urethane: one group underwent only the surgical procedures including laminectomy, and the other two received either a 2.3- or 53.0-gm injury at the T1 spinal cord segment for 1 minute. The CO was measured using the thermodilution technique. CVS parameters were measured before injury, and then at designated times for 135 minutes after SCI. Analysis of variance and paired t-test with significance at p = 0.05 were used for analysis. There were no CVS changes as a result of anesthesia, operative time, or laminectomy alone. Cardiovascular system (CVS) changes occurred after the 2.3- and 53.0-gm. injuries but were significantly different only in the 53.0-gm injured animals. In this group mSAP increased from a preinjury value of 105 +/- 8 mm Hg to 178 +/- 11 mm Hg as a result of SCI, followed by a prolonged period of hypotension (46 +/- 15 mm Hg) lasting until 135 min post SCI. The CO after SCI also decreased from 394 +/- 22 to 218 +/- 29 ml/min/kg with the TPR reaching a minimal level at 45 min post SCI (265 +/- 23 to 213 +/- 29 mm Hg/ml/min gm wt), after which it returned to preinjury values. There were no significant changes in the CVP in either group. In the 53.0-gm group significant bradycardia (492 +/- 7 to 356 +/- 44 beats/min) was observed by 45 min and continued to decrease until 135 min after SCI. Thus the CVS showed two major alterations after severe SCI: post-traumatic hypotension, and a parallel decline in CO. There were no major changes in TPR, HR, or CVP, although HR ultimately declined. These findings suggest that the decline in CO was not entirely due to decreased sympathetic tone, but may also have resulted from direct myocardial injury, similar to that demonstrated after head injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Most of these injuries could be prevented if the driver and occupants of motor vehicles wore seatbelts or used other restraining devices. The injuries produced when an unrestrained occupant of a motor vehicle is ejected from that vehicle or impacts on a hostile surface at high speed occur in a reproducible pattern. The types of injuries sustained by drivers and front seat passengers are different and specific enough to allow one to identify drivers and passengers with confidence. Because of severe life-threatening injuries to the central nervous system, and thoracic and abdominal viscera, other serious injuries may be overlooked. Knowledge of the mechanism of injury and the role of the victim (i.e., driver or passenger) should lead to the prompt radiographic evaluation of all areas at risk. Our findings are based on a study of 250 drivers and 250 front seat passengers involved in motor vehicle accidents. We found distinct common injury patterns and radiographic findings in drivers and front seat passengers.\r"

Multivariate analysis of clinical parameters was utilized in attempt to predict which patients would have abnormal IVP's and which would eventually require genitourinary operation. Thirty-four patients (25%) demonstrated abnormalities on IVP; however, no combination of clinical findings (including degree of hematuria) could reliably predict which patients would have abnormal IVP's. On the other hand, in 90% of the patients, the necessity for genitourinary operation could be reliably predicted based on: presence of blood at the urethral meatus, degree of hematuria, patient age, Injury Severity Score, and number of rib fractures. We conclude that to detect IVP abnormalities, IVP's need to be performed on all blunt trauma patients with hematuria. However, patients likely to have injuries requiring operative repair can be predicted. Those patients unlikely to have genitourinary injury requiring repair, therefore, may have IVP performed on a nonurgent basis.\r"

No patient developed genu recurvatum deformity or leg length discrepancy due to the injury. Open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice in displaced intra-articular fractures.

  ".W": "Hyperglycemia among adult trauma patients with head injuries is a recognized phenomenon which has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis when it takes the form of nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia. It is not known to what extent a similar phenomenon occurs in pediatric patients, although it is known that a child's physiologic response to injury, particularly to neurologic injury, is often different than an adult's. This study was undertaken to characterize the hyperglycemic response of children with closed head injury compared to children with a non-head injury, and to measure the extent to which the presence of hyperglycemia is associated with a poor outcome among children with severe head injury. Records for all children ages 2 to 12 years admitted to a major regional trauma center with closed head injury over a 6-year period were compared to the records of a control group of children hospitalized for a non-head injury. The hyperglycemic response was more common among those with head trauma, occurring in 40% compared to 5% of the controls (p less than 0.001); however, the level of hyperglycemia could not be associated with any indicator of outcome. The entity known as nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia did not occur in any of these patients. Apparently, the hyperglycemia associated with closed head injury in children is transient, does not need to be treated with insulin therapy, and in contrast to what has been demonstrated in adult trauma patients, does not predict patient outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Unlike previous reports, in 123 patients with abdominal injury or surgery significant and persistent hypokalemia was observed only after traumatic or surgical injuries of the liver. On the contrary, in all other extrahepatic abdominal trauma or operations kalemia was normal. This discrepancy may be related to the much greater abundance, in comparison with other abdominal organs, of adrenergic endings present in the liver. Trauma to or surgery of the liver stimulates such fibers, which locally release proportionally large amounts of norepinephrine. The consequent stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors enhances the transfer of potassium from the blood into the cells, even if the affinity of norepinephrine for such receptors is less than that of epinephrine. The frequent finding of kaliuria at the upper normal levels may suggest an accessory role of aldosterone in causing and maintaining this hypokalemia.\r"

Persons involved in collisions with other powered vehicles had 36% more fractures and higher ISS than those involved in accidents where no collision occurred with a powered vehicle. Female passengers, sitting sideways, and involved in collisions, sustained fewer injuries than did a comparable group of male passengers who sat astride; the ISS of female passengers was also lower.

The first consecutive 3,620 extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatments with the HM3 Dornier lithotriptor at our institution resulted in 24 hematomas in 21 patients, for an incidence of 0.66 per cent. Various factors associated with treatment were examined. The number of shock waves (up to 2,000) and voltage up to 24 kv. did not correlate with the development of hematoma. Coagulation studies were normal in all patients with hematomas. There was no correlation of patients size and weight, or stone size, number or location with the occurrence rate of perinephric hematoma. Patients with pre-existing hypertension, particularly those with unsatisfactory control of hypertension, had a significantly increased incidence of perinephric hematoma. The incidence of hematoma in hypertensive patients was 2.5 per cent and it increased to 3.8 per cent in patients with unsatisfactory control of hypertension. Therefore, pre-existing hypertension is a significant risk factor in the occurrence of post-extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy bleeding. The incidence of perinephric hematoma also was increased in patients with pre-treatment urinary tract infection and those who underwent simultaneous bilateral treatment. Management of post-extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy bleeding generally is conservative although a third of the patients required transfusion.\r"

Overestimation of creatinine clearance may result in aminoglycoside overdosage and resultant nephrotoxicity. Three newer prediction equations have been developed from creatinine clearances measured in neurologically abnormal patients. These 6 equations were tested in 77 male and 9 female spinal cord injury patients (48 quadriplegics and 38 paraplegics, including 38 with acute and 48 with chronic injuries). The equation developed by Sawyer and Hutchins was superior to 2 other equations developed in spinal cord injury patients and 3 equations developed in neurologically normal patients. However, creatinine clearances predicted by this equation were within 30 ml. per minute of measured creatinine clearances in only two-thirds of the spinal cord injury patients. Errors ranged from overestimation by 95 ml. per minute (151 per cent) to underestimation by 106 ml. per minute (45 per cent). The potential for large errors in creatinine clearance prediction necessitates measurement of creatinine clearance as soon as possible when renal excreted and toxic pharmaceuticals are administered to spinal cord injury patients.\r"

We evaluated retrospectively the experience at our institution with rigid ureteroscopy from January 1983 to July 1986 in an attempt to identify clinical situations or techniques that tended to increase the incidence of either success or complications. We determined that ureteroscopic complications were rare in procedures performed for diagnosis compared to those performed for calculi (2 of 33 or 6 per cent versus 27 of 99 or 27 per cent, p less than 0.025). The likelihood of failure or complication was greater for stones above than for those below the pelvic brim (15 of 25 or 60 per cent versus 26 of 75 or 35 per cent, p less than 0.05). Major complications were more common early in our experience (9 of 63 or 14 per cent versus 2 of 69 or 3 per cent for the combined years 1983 and 1984 compared to 1985 and 1986, p less than 0.05). Our success rates in the treatment of calculous disease were similar to those reported previously, and they were somewhat better for stones located below (62 of 75 or 83 per cent) than for those above (17 of 25 or 68 per cent) the pelvic brim. Based on our findings we conclude that carefully performed diagnostic ureteroscopy has little potential for major complications, ureteroscopy for stones above the pelvic brim should be avoided when possible, and an increased rate of complications and failures is expected early in any series owing at least partly to the learning curve effect.\r"

Furthermore, 10 per cent of this group died of renal failure and 23 per cent lost 1 kidney each. In 26 patients with an ileal conduit 69 per cent of the renal units evaluated were abnormal. Only 1 patient died of renal failure but 27 per cent lost 1 kidney each. Of 32 patients with primary bladder closure 31 had preservation of renal function. Twelve of 18 patients (67 per cent) in whom vesical neck reconstruction had been completed had total urinary continence and 3 (17 per cent) had partial continence.

The multidisciplinary findings correlated well with the intracavernous dose needed for full erection. The group without pathological hemodynamic findings (36 patients) needed an average of 0.67 ml. and the group with pathological inflow (107) needed an average of 1.07 ml. In the venous insufficiency group (57 patients) only 18 achieved full erections with an average of 2.1 ml. (39 achieved tumescence only to 3 ml.). The results show that standardized intracavernous injection of a vasoactive substance mixture is a useful method to evaluate penile hemodynamics. This pharmacological test appears to be effective in the differential diagnosis of nonvascular and vascular erectile dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The American Medical Systems inflatable penile prosthesis has undergone periodic design changes to improve device reliability and longevity while maintaining a high degree of patient and partner satisfaction. Previous data reported from this institution did not consider these frequent design changes and the assessment of device reliability incorporated consecutive cases involving several different designs. This study was designed to evaluate followup data on 120 patients who received the model 700 inflatable penile prosthesis, permitting assessment of device reliability of a single design. Two groups were evaluated: a pre-fix group of 57 patients and a post-fix group of 63 patients. Over-all, 11.7 per cent of the total group required revision (21 per cent of the pre-fix and 3.2 per cent of the post-fix groups). Careful life-table analysis of the results with the current model 700 device (post-fix) reveals that this model has a 97 per cent chance of maintaining normal mechanical function for 3 years. Further assessment of these patients in the future will provide additional data on long-term reliability of this design.\r"

The remaining 2 patients were treated with inflation for 8 weeks with resolution of the curvature. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first reported complications produced by abnormal scar tissue outside of the inflammatory pseudocapsule after implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis.\r"

We analyzed 70 serum specimens from patients with suspected or known prostatic carcinoma by both assays. Results from the assays showed close linear correlation (r equals 0.988) but the Pros-Check assay yielded values 1.85 times those of the Tandem-R test. The proportional bias between assays is owing to differences in the values assigned to calibration standards in the assays, and it demonstrates a need for improved standardization of prostate specific antigen assays. Important consequences of the bias between assays are that different normal ranges apply and that values from the 2 assays cannot be compared directly.\r"

  ".U": "88172661\r", 
  ".W": "The usefulness of prostate specific antigen to predict final pathological stage was studied in 178 consecutive patients. Prostate specific antigen was determined preoperatively in all patients by a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay. All pathological specimens were examined for capsular penetration, seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node involvement. Prostate specific antigen correlated directly with capsular penetration (p less than 0.002), seminal vesicle involvement (p less than 0.02) and lymph node involvement (p less than 0.05). However the diagnostic accuracy of an elevated serum antigen level on an individual basis was only 55 per cent for capsular penetration and 50 per cent for seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node involvement. With a log-linear regression model, the half-life of prostate specific antigen was calculated to be 3.15 +/- 0.09 days. From the equation PSA (t) equals PSA (2) e[-0.2197(t-2)], prostate specific antigen can be used to detect residual cancer on day t in the immediate postoperative period. With respect to long-term followup, 127 patients have been monitored for longer than 2 months postoperatively with prostate specific antigen (mean followup 2 years, range 2 months to 8.6 years). Of the 101 patients who had favorable pathological findings at operation (organ-confined cancer or capsular penetration only) 92 (91 per cent) had a followup antigen concentration in the female range (0.0 to 0.2 ng. per ml.), whereas only 5 of 26 men (19 per cent) with either seminal vesicle involvement or lymph node involvement had an antigen value that was less than 0.2 ng. per ml. All patients with a documented clinical recurrence (8 of 127, 6 per cent) had an elevated followup serum prostate specific antigen concentration. These findings suggest that preoperative levels of prostate specific antigen are not sufficiently reliable to predict final pathological stage on an individual basis in patients with early prostatic cancer, and that the antigen is a sensitive tumor marker for the detection of residual disease after radical prostatectomy and subsequent recurrence of tumor on long-term followup.\r"

Intervals from surgery to testing ranged from 3 to 30 months, with an average of 9 months. All patients achieved some degree of tumescence. In response to intracavernous papaverine injection only 1 patient (5 per cent) obtained an erection equivalent to the preoperative state. Of 18 patients who were fully potent preoperatively 8 (44 per cent) achieved an erection less than normal but judged to be sufficient for intercourse by the examining physician. Twelve patients, including 2 who were not fully potent preoperatively, had erections of poor quality insufficient for vaginal penetration. The results suggest that in most of these patients postoperative erectile dysfunction is predominantly vasculogenic in origin. Thus, factors other than injury to the neurovascular bundles may be responsible for postoperative impotence.\r"

However, impotence remains an unavoidable complication in some patients. It is in such patients that we have chosen to evaluate the technique of intracavernosal injection of a papaverine/phentolamine mixture to obtain erections. After classical radical prostatectomy potency was restored by the injection technique in 12 of 14 patients (85 per cent). Three patients who failed to attain erections initially had successful results with larger doses. Two patients who failed to achieve erections had the lowest penile brachial index values and 1 in whom priapism developed had the highest value, indicating that this may be a useful technique to determine the initial dosage of the injection.\r"

Of 47 biopsies of acetowhite (the whitish change that occurs when an epithelial surface is stained with acetic acid) lesions there were 26 cases of histologically confirmed condylomata, 9 of koilocytotic atypia and 12 with false positive results. There were 25 men whose sexual partners had cervical condylomata and cervical dysplasia. In this subgroup, considered to be at higher risk for flat condylomata, the screening method revealed 15 cases of condylomata, 6 of koilocytotic atypia and 4 in which no changes by acetic acid could be found. The extensive involvement of genital skin with flat condylomata in this subgroup raises doubts as to the practicality of treatment. Nevertheless, before treatment is rendered a punch biopsy for confirmation of the screening test is advised.\r"

Likewise, 3 patients underwent augmentation for an inadequate bladder capacity and dry interval of less than 2 hours after bladder neck reconstruction and epispadias repair. Of these 7 patients 3 had undergone 2 previous bladder neck reconstructions, while 4 had undergone 1 prior repair. Five augmentations were performed for an inadequate bladder capacity before any type of continence procedure had been done. Nine patients underwent adjunctive procedures in addition to bladder augmentation, including a Young-Dees-Leadbetter procedure in 4, an artificial urinary sphincter in 3, transureteroureterostomy and psoas hitch in 1, and a Mitrofanoff procedure and bladder neck closure in 1. Of the 12 patients 11 are continent, although 9 require intermittent catheterization. There were no major complications. However, 1 artificial urinary sphincter was removed for erosion 2 years after placement. Augmentation cystoplasty has provided prolonged stability of the upper tracts and continence in these patients, and it has proved to be a successful alternative to urinary diversion in this select group of exstrophy failures.\r"

Twelve mature beagles with enlarged prostates were divided into two groups of similar age, prostatic size, and prostatic histology. Dogs were given either CGS-16949A at a dosage of 2.5 mg./kg./day p.o. (n = 6) or an oral placebo (n = 6) for 25 weeks. Treatment with aromatase inhibitor had no significant effect on prostatic weight nor on total DNA content when compared to controls (p greater than 0.1). Semen volume did not change with treatment, and prostatic tissue concentrations of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 5 alpha-androstan-3 alpha,17 beta-diol (3 alpha-diol) were similar for the treated and control beagles (p greater than 0.1). Protein concentration in the ejaculate, however, was significantly greater for the dogs receiving CGS-16949A (p less than 0.01). Histologically, there was no difference in the incidence or type of BPH between the two treatment groups. Beagles treated with aromatase inhibitor, however, did have a more severe inflammatory infiltrate of the prostatic parenchyma than the control dogs (p less than 0.01). The mean serum testosterone concentration for the beagles treated with aromatase inhibitor was 10 times greater than that for the control animals (p less than 0.01). The endocrine effect of this aromatase inhibitor in the male canine is presented in the preceding paper. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of endogenous aromatase activity is not an effective treatment for spontaneous BPH in the intact canine.\r"

Using both direct radio-ligand studies and the inhibition of receptor binding by subtype-selective pharmacological antagonists, we have studied the distribution of subtypes of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the urinary bladder of the rabbit and man. Alpha adrenergic receptors were quantified by direct binding of tritiated prazosin (alpha-1), yohimbine (alpha-2), and the non-selective alpha adrenergic ligand dihydroergocriptine (DHE). These studies demonstrated that the distribution of alpha receptor subtypes in the bladder base (for both rabbit and human) is approximately 80% alpha-1 and 20% alpha-2. Beta receptor subtypes were identified by the inhibition of the non-selective ligand 3H-dihydroalprenalol (DHA) by the beta-1 selective inhibitor ICI-89 and the beta-2 selective inhibitor ICI-118. Initial studies demonstrated that the beta adrenergic density of the bladder body was 92 fmol per mg. protein for the rabbit and 32 fmol per mg. protein for human bladder body. Inhibition of DHA binding by ICI-118 demonstrated a single class of receptor with an IC50 of approximately 0.013 microM for both rabbit and human. Inhibition of DHA binding by ICI-89 also demonstrated one class of receptors with an IC50 of approximately 9.0 microM for both species. These results indicate that there are primarily beta-2 receptors in the rabbit and human bladder body. Although the number of muscarinic subtypes in existence is currently being re-evaluated, there are at least two which can be identified by the selective muscarinic agent pirenzepine (PZP). The brain has been shown to contain both high and low affinity PZP sites. Using both direct PZP binding to the bladder body, and the inhibition by PZP of the non-selective radio-ligand quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB), we have demonstrated that both the rabbit and human bladder body have no observable high affinity PZP-selective binding and the inhibition of 3H-QNB by PZP demonstrated that there was only the low-affinity PZP binding site. Although receptor subtypes in the bladder have been the subject of numerous investigations, this is the first study describing the distribution of both adrenergic and cholinergic receptor subtypes in both the rabbit and human.\r"

  ".U": "88172689\r", 
  ".W": "Dogs, 8.5 to 10 kg. in weight, were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (35 mg./kg.), intraperitoneally. Penile erection as indicated by an increase in the intracorporal pressure (ICP-increase) was produced by electrical stimulation of the right cavernous nerves. Drugs were administered into the internal pudendal artery (IPA) and femoral vein. A low dose (0.2 to 0.4 microgram/kg.) of clonidine, an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist, which could not affect either ICP or systemic arterial pressure (SAP) through an intravenous route, did suppress the ICP-increase markedly via direct injection into the IPA which supplies the penile blood flow. By intra-IPA injection, yohimbine (2.5 micrograms/kg.), an alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, remarkably restored the ICP to the erection state. By intravenous injection, clonidine at a dose of 1.6 to 3.2 micrograms/kg. also profoundly reduced the ICP-increase, but only negligibly lowered the SAP. The IPA blood flow (IPAF) decreased coincidentally when the ICP-increase was effectively reduced by either intravenous or intra-IPA injection of clonidine. These findings suggest clonidine could act locally in the penile structure to suppress penile erection, possibly resulting from a penile vasoconstriction involving alpha 2 adrenoceptor. Whether this vasoconstriction is caused by a direct alpha 2 stimulating effect on the vascular smooth muscle or by an alpha 2 presynaptic inhibition of the vasodilator nerve (cavernous nerve) endings has been discussed.\r"

Many of the renal cell carcinomas continued to express MDR1 gene at high levels, reflecting the increased expression of MDR1 RNA in normal kidneys. In other urogenital tumors, the MDR1 RNA levels were low reflecting low MDR1 RNA levels in normal bladder, prostate and testis. For comparative purposes, we performed in vitro chemosensitivity testing on many tumor samples using soft agar culture techniques. Vinblastine sensitivity in vitro inversely correlated with MDR1 RNA levels (p less than 0.01). Moreover, mean sensitivity of seven renal cell carcinomas to vinblastin was significantly lower than that of the other seven cancers (p less than 0.05). As for doxorubicin, mean sensitivity of six renal cell carcinomas was lower than the others (p less than 0.1). These results suggest that the high MDR1 RNA levels in renal cell carcinomas are associated with intrinsic multidrug-resistance.\r"

In an attempt to gain more information regarding this interaction, the binding of urinary proteins to calcium oxalate crystals formed in urine in vitro was studied. 0.1 M calcium chloride and 0.1 M sodium oxalate were added to an aliquot of urine collected from five non-infected, non-stone forming males. The resulting calcium oxalate crystals were centrifuged and the pellet demineralized with 5% EDTA. Gel filtration chromatography was used to isolate the protein fraction from the urine samples before and after crystallization of calcium oxalate. The proteins recovered from the crystals and urine were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Many, but not all of the urinary proteins were bound by the crystals. Albumin, seen to the most abundant urinary protein, was absent or markedly diminished in all instances, and the second most abundant urinary protein, PC-30, became the predominant protein component of the crystals. An unidentified protein with approximate molecular weight of 22,000 daltons and isoelectric point of 6.4 was highly concentrated by the crystals even when undetected in the urine. The study suggests that the binding of urinary proteins to calcium oxalate crystals formed in urine in vitro is not a random event but rather a selective phenomenon.\r"

However, the delayed complication of diffuse arterial narrowing causing severe ischemia has received little emphasis, perhaps because follow-up arteriography is not always performed. This report describes five patients--women 43 to 62 years of age--with progressive leg ischemia discovered 2 to 4 months after embolectomy with the balloon catheter. Angiography showed a characteristic pattern of severe, smooth narrowing of that portion of the artery in which balloon embolectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of arterial specimens, available in two of the five patients, revealed marked intimal cellular proliferation, which narrowed the arteries severely without evidence of thrombosis, significant atheromatosis, or active arteritis. The cause appears to be intimal damage by the balloon. Embolectomy with the balloon catheter should be done especially carefully in relatively young women.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial stenosis occurring after balloon catheter embolectomy may be caused by myointimal hyperplasia (MIH). This study investigated the effects of shear force and repeated catheter withdrawals on the development of MIH after embolectomy. The procedures were performed in the common carotid and common femoral arteries of 18 anesthetized dogs. During catheter withdrawal, the balloons were filled gradually to produce shear forces rising smoothly from 50 to 200 gm. Four weeks after embolectomy, the vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ with 2% glutaraldehyde and were excised. The thickness and circumferential extent of MIH were measured in cross sections from segments of the vessels exposed to shear forces of 50, 100, and 200 gm. Sixty-nine of 72 arteries remained patent. Low shear force (50 gm) consistently elicited less MIH than did higher shear forces (p less than 0.05). At each level of shear force, repeated withdrawals resulted in greater circumferential extent of MIH than did single withdrawals (p less than 0.005). Although clinically it usually is necessary to perform multiple passes during balloon embolectomy, these data suggest that, in humans, attempts should be made to perform a minimal number of catheter withdrawals at low shear force to minimize the subsequent development of MIH.\r"

As a first step toward developing a reliable guidance system, laser-induced surface fluorescence and a fluorescent probe were used to differentiate plaque from normal arterial wall. The aortas from four normal New Zealand white rabbits and six atherosclerotic rabbits were studied in vitro. Rabbits from each group received 2.5 mg/kg of hematoporphyrin derivative intravenously 24 hours before death. Segments of the aortas were irradiated with a helium-cadmium laser, and the tissue surface fluorescence spectra were recorded with an optical multichannel analyzer. A plaque index, based on the resulting spectra, was calculated for each specimen of aorta. The spectra from normal aorta without hematoporphyrin derivative, normal aorta with hematoporphyrin derivative, and from plaque of atherosclerotic rabbits without hematoporphyrin derivative showed the same wavelength dependence. The plaque index values were not significantly different from one another. However, in plaque from atherosclerotic rabbits given hematoporphyrin derivative, the spectrum was markedly different, showing a broad spectral peak at 632 nm. This spectral peak corresponds to the spectral peak of hematoporphyrin derivative and was only seen in the plaque of atherosclerotic rabbits given hematoporphyrin derivative. The plaque index for these specimens was significantly different from all other specimens (p less than 0.001). This difference in fluorescence spectra and plaque index could be incorporated into a guidance system for laser angioplasty.\r"

Transcutaneous PO2 (tcPCO2), foot-chest tcPO2 index, transcutaneous PCO2 (tcPCO2), foot tcPO2/tcPCO2 index (tcPO2/tcPCO2), ankle Doppler systolic pressure (AP), and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) were determined in 89 revascularized limbs. The measurement of tcPO2 and foot-chest tcPO2 was found to be more sensitive to degrees of severity of limb ischemia and more closely associated with the outcome of revascularization than AP and ABI. TcPCO2 and tcPO2/tcPCO2 were not useful in assessment of the vascular patient undergoing reconstructive surgery. Before operation, tcPO2 less than or equal to 22 torr and foot-chest tcPO2 less than or equal to 0.46 indicate severe limb ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. After operation, tcPO2 less than or equal to 22 torr and foot-chest tcPO2 index less than or equal to 0.53 indicate that revascularization is likely to fail. We conclude that tcPO2 monitoring, as a metabolic test of actual tissue perfusion, is a more reliable indicator of preoperative limb ischemia and postoperative outcome of revascularization than hemodynamic, Doppler-derived pressure tests.\r"

In four sham-operated dogs, infrarenal pressure was maintained; reinforced cannulas, capable of resisting clamp compression, were placed within the aorta and the inferior vena cava. Suprarenal and infrarenal arterial pressure and renal blood flow were continuously monitored. Blood samples taken before clamp application and at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after clamp removal were assayed for adenosine, inosine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine. On clamp removal suprarenal pressure immediately dropped from a preclamp pressure of 114 to 82 mm Hg but returned to preclamp values within 1 minute. Renal blood flow was significantly reduced after clamp release, reaching a nadir of 39% of preclamp flow. This reduction persisted despite a normalization of arterial pressure. Summed plasma purines were significantly elevated 1 minute after clamp removal. Sham-operated dogs showed no significant alterations in arterial pressure, renal blood flow, or plasma purine levels. This study demonstrates a significant non-alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated reduction in renal blood flow and a coincident increase in purine degradation products after removal of an infrarenal aortic cross-clamp.\r"

Endothelial cell (EC) seeding of such grafts has been shown to improve measurably their ability to resist a bacteremic challenge several weeks after implantation, presumably by reducing the amount of thrombus-free area (TFA) on their luminal surface. However, no investigators have reported the impact of EC seeding on the ability of chronically implanted vascular prostheses to resist a late bacteremic challenge. Bilateral common carotid interposition grafts were placed in 15 adult mongrel dogs with a 4 mm internal diameter, experimental, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) prosthesis. One animal died shortly after operation and the grafts in two dogs thrombosed, thereby leaving 12 animals with at least one patent graft for subsequent study. At a mean interval of 45 weeks after implantation, five dogs (seven patent grafts) were challenged with an intravenous infusion of 3 X 10(8) radiolabeled Staphylococcus aureus; bacterial adherence and the TFA of the graft's luminal surface were determined for each of the patent grafts. There was no statistically significant difference in bacterial adherence or TFA between EC-seeded and control grafts. At a mean interval of 53 weeks after implantation, the remaining seven dogs (14 patent grafts) received a similar bacterial infusion and the animals were allowed to recover. Five days later, the grafts were harvested and cultured. Once again, there was no significant difference in the infectibility of EC-seeded vs. control grafts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was performed between May 1982 and March 1987 to assess the value of intraoperative prereconstruction angiography (IPA) in limb salvage. Eligibility was limited to patients with rest pain, ischemic ulcers, or gangrene limited to the toes: only candidates for infrapopliteal bypass were included. Seventy-eight such patients were examined with preoperative angiography. Delayed films, selective catheterization, reactive hyperemia, or vasodilators were used routinely. In only 11 of 78 patients (14%) was the runoff adequately visualized, demonstrating the tibial vessels and the pedal arch. The remaining 67 patients (86%) (with nonreconstructable disease by currently accepted outflow criteria) had surgical exposure of a tibial or pedal artery for IPA. In 56 of these patients (84%) good runoff was demonstrated and bypass was performed. The reconstruction rate was 86% (67 of 78 patients), significantly higher than the 33% rate reported by others. The operative mortality rate was 2.8% (2 of 78 patients). We concluded that in severe ischemia preoperative angiography is often inadequate in demonstrating runoff, even with adjunctive measures to dilate the outflow vessels. IPA through the tibial and pedal vessels eliminates all of the proximal vascular resistance, thereby providing a \"completion angiogram\" before reconstruction. This in turn extends reconstructability to many patients who would otherwise undergo primary amputation.\r"

Spontaneous and arachidonate-stimulated prostaglandin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Endothelial integrity was analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Prostaglandin production in blood vs that in saline solution was 1821 +/- 1264 and 1259 +/- 719 pg/cm2/min at control and 6705 +/- 3702 vs 6264 +/- 3409 pg/cm2/min, respectively, after stimulation. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at any time point. Thromboxane levels were also indistinguishable between groups. Microscopy revealed 70% endothelial loss in blood vs 95% for saline solution.

This study attempts to determine a safe margin for laser graft thrombectomy. An 18 watt argon laser with a 2 mm metal-encased sapphire tip fiberoptic system was used. Specimens such as autogenous vein, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and Dacron grafts as well as polypropylene and PTFE sutures were harvested from amputated human legs. Laser energy was delivered from the tip of the fiberoptic system while perpendicular to and in direct contact with these materials. The effects were examined histologically and compared by determining the bursting pressure of the grafts and the breaking strength of the sutures. The results indicate that seven sections of autogenous vein grafts and 11 sections of PTFE grafts were perforated by laser delivery of 32.9 +/- 9.9 and 50.0 +/- 7.1 joules, respectively, whereas two sections of Dacron grafts were easily perforated after only 10 joules was delivered. The bursting pressure of PTFE and autogenous vein grafts after laser application was determined to be more than 300 mm Hg. The breaking strength of 6-0 PTFE sutures was compared before and after receiving 200 joules by contact laser application. No significant difference was found; in a before laser application the breaking strength was 585.0 +/- 9.6 gm compared with 560.0 +/- 16.4 gm after laser application (n = 4, p greater than 0.1). However, 6-0 polypropylene sutures were easily melted after receiving 10 joules of laser energy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although heparinization has been recommended, its action in an experimental model of I-R has not been evaluated. We investigated the ability of heparinization to decrease I-R injury in 10 anesthetized dogs (nonheparinized, n = 5; heparinized, n = 5), subjecting one gracilis muscle to 6 hours of ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion while the identically prepared contralateral muscle served as a nonischemic control. Skeletal muscle infarction was determined by Tc-PYP uptake. Endothelial permeability was quantified by measurement of skeletal muscle 125I-Alb activity after intravenous injection. Interstitial hydrogen ion (H+) accumulation was determined by a miniature pH electrode inserted into the gracilis muscle. Isotopic activities from the ischemic muscle were calculated as a percentage of the contralateral nonischemic muscle (mean +/- SEM). Nonheparinized ischemic muscles had an increase in the activities of Tc-PYP and 125I-Alb of 684% +/- 149% and 742% +/- 130%, which were reduced to 218% +/- 54% and 378% +/- 85% by heparinization, respectively (p less than 0.05). During ischemia, the nonheparinized muscles accumulated 1223 +/- 121 nmol of H+ compared with 785 +/- 95 nmol in the heparinized animals (p less than 0.01). This significant reduction in I-R injury may be causally related to diminished endothelial permeability and H+ accumulation.\r"

The optimization of conditions that permit regeneration of these attachment forces may allow rapid establishment of a durable, biocompatible EC monolayer. We examined the effects of three major factors, protein substrate, EC incubation time, and shear stress, on the attachment kinetics of human adult ECs to two different polymers. ECs were incubated up to 30 minutes on polymers (PS or PET) coated with extracellular matrix proteins: collagen I/III, fibronectin, collagen IV/V, laminin, gelatin, or saline control. After incubation, continued attachment in the presence of shear stress (created in a rotating disc device) between zero and 90 dynes/cm2 for 30 minutes was evaluated. Maximal adherence was observed on all substrates by 30 minutes. Therefore, after a 30-minute incubation, the percentage of cells attached (postshear ECs/preshear ECs/preshear ECs X 100) was measured as a function of shear stress. ECs attached to a matrix of fibronectin or collagen I/III demonstrated shear-resistant adherence after as little as 5 minutes of static incubation before initial shear exposure. By 30 minutes, more than 90% of the ECs on both matrices demonstrated the ability to remain attached in the presence of 90 dynes/cm2 of shear stress. We conclude that forces that attach ECs to surfaces are affected by temporal factors (incubation time) and substrate composition and may be quantified with a defined shear stress detachment assay. Understanding and manipulating these temporal physiochemical parameters should allow one to re-create an optimal EC monolayer on a blood-contacting surface.\r"

Subsequently, the intima of the graft thickens on account of SMC proliferation only where an overlying endothelial layer is present. SMCs in normal endothelialized artery proximal and distal to the graft show no detectable proliferation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility that growth factors released from the graft endothelium or SMCs regulate SMC proliferation. PTFE grafts (4 mm I.D., 60 micron internodal distance) were placed in the aortoiliac circulation of baboons and removed at 2 weeks. The grafts were perfused ex vivo with tissue culture medium (Ham's F12 + 25 mmol/L HEPES and 2% calf plasma-derived serum) at 2.5 ml/hr for 5 hours. Perfused native carotid, aorta, and femoral arteries served as controls. After this period of perfusion, graft and arterial endothelium was intact as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The mitogenic activity (thymidine incorporation) of the perfusates was measured in an assay with quiescent 3T3 cells and baboon aortic SMCs and corrected for the surface area of the perfused vessels. These studies demonstrated markedly increased mitogenic activity in the perfusates of grafts compared with perfusates of native vessels. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the vascular wall cells in healing grafts can produce factors that regulate smooth muscle cell growth.\r"

We recommend that ATLL be seriously considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, lymphatic leukemia, or hypercalcemia.\r"

We describe 30 patients with normal renal function referred to our clinic during the years 1970 through 1987 for evaluation of hematuria, usually microscopic, in whom prior urologic and radiological studies had failed to determine the cause of bleeding. Urinary sediment from the patients and first-degree relatives revealed hemoglobin and red blood cell casts; the inheritance pattern was consistent with autosomal dominant transmission. During follow-up for up to 18 years, renal function remained normal, thus confirming the diagnosis of benign familial hematuria. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy and Alport's syndrome were less common than benign familial hematuria and could be differentiated from it by history, physical examination, and routine laboratory testing. Since benign familial hematuria is a common disorder in adults with hematuria and normal renal function, urinary sediment from patients and family members should be examined before extensive urologic and radiological procedures are performed.\r"

Those with hematologic diseases accounted for 43% of the patients but used 86% of the platelets. Sixty-eight percent of the transfusions were given to prevent bleeding and 32% were given to treat active bleeding. Ninety-two percent of therapeutic transfusions but only 22% of prophylactic transfusions met guidelines established by the Transfusion Therapeutics Committee of the University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinics, Minneapolis. However, 78% of prophylactic platelet transfusions that did not meet the guidelines involved patients with at least one clinical factor that their physicians believed placed them at an increased risk of bleeding. Following this analysis, the guidelines were modified and applied prospectively to requests for platelets. This resulted in a 14% decrease in the number of platelet units used during the following year. We conclude that published recommendations for platelet transfusions do not reflect the complex nature of many patients' conditions and that the use of guidelines developed by the medical staff can alter the use of platelet transfusions.\r"

  ".W": "In 1981, sixteen cases of nosocomial legionellosis occurred among 456 patients admitted to a new hematology-oncology unit (35 per 1000 admissions). Monoclonal antibody typing and restriction endonuclease plasmid analysis identified a unique strain (09,04) of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 isolated from both patients and water outlets. Continuous hyperchlorination of the hot and cold water began in January 1982, and chlorine levels of 3 to 5 mg/L have been maintained most recently. Water samples have been consistently negative for Legionella for more than five years. Four sporadic cases of nosocomial legionellosis have occurred in the hematology-oncology unit during the same period (one per 1000 admissions) associated with a different strain of L pneumophila serogroup 1 (09,00). The environmental reservoir(s) of L pneumophila serogroup 1 in these cases has not been identified. Levels of trihalomethanes (potential carcinogens) were high (greater than 100 micrograms/L) when chlorine levels of hot water exceeded 4 mg/L. Some corrosion damage to the water distribution system has occurred: the average number of leaks per month increased steadily from zero in 1982 to 5.2 in 1986. The chlorinator installation costs were +75,800, and annual operation expenses were +12,500. Continuous hyperchlorination is a promising but still experimental technique for control of nosocomial legionellosis. In our experience, epidemic disease has been controlled, but sporadic cases have continued to occur.\r"

Seventy patients and eleven control subjects were studied. In diabetic patients with normal urinary albumin excretion (less than 30 mg/24 hr), fractional IgG clearance was two to three times higher than in control subjects, whereas fractional clearance of the anionic plasma proteins IgG4 and albumin was similar to that of control subjects. These alterations indicate an increase in anionic pore charge within the glomerular basement membrane concomitant with an increase in either pore size or impairment of tubular reabsorption. Diabetic patients, whose urinary albumin excretion has started to rise (30 to 100 mg/24 hr), had unchanged fractional IgG compared to patients with normal albumin excretion, while fractional IgG4 and albumin clearances were increased three- to fourfold; indicating unchanged glomerular pore size, but a decrease in anionic pore charge. In patients demonstrating urinary albumin excretion of greater than 100 mg/24 hr fractional IgG clearance increased to the same extent as fractional albumin clearance, indicating an increase in large pore area. Fractional beta 2-microglobulin clearances were similar to that of control subjects in the different patient groups indicating unchanged tubular reabsorption of proteins. Thus, the increase in large pore area seen in patients with clinical nephropathy is preceded by loss of anionic charge in the glomerular basement membrane. It is likely that this loss of anionic charge is due to loss of heparan sulphate-proteoglycan.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that theophylline increases both renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during the initiation phase of post-ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) in rats. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine the effects of theophylline during the maintenance phase of ARF, five days after initiation. Clearance techniques were used to measure renal function in a control group of pentobarbital anesthetized rats (group C) and in three experimental groups, five days after subjecting the left kidney to a thirty-minute period of complete ischemia. Group SS received saline during both the ischemic episode and the clearance measurements; group ST received saline during ischemia and theophylline, acutely, during the clearance measurements; group TS received theophylline during ischemia and saline during the clearance measurements. In comparison with the values for the control group (group C), RPF and GFR of the post-ischemic left kidneys of group SS were approximately half normal. In groups ST and TS, RPF and GFR of the left kidneys were higher than in group SS. Collectively, these results demonstrate that pretreatment with theophylline during the initiation phase of ischemia-induced ARF leads to increased RPF and GFR during the maintenance phase, and that acute theophylline treatment during the maintenance phase acutely increases RPF and GFR. Since increases in GFR were associated with increases in RPF, and since theophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that adenosine-mediated hemodynamic changes play a pathogenic role in ischemia-induced ARF in rats.\r"

We studied functional effects--influence of sex, litter size, diuresis, creatinine clearance, G-kidney concentration, and kidney morphological alterations--in rat neonates on day 1 of life. After G and N, the creatinine clearance of the neonates was decreased according to the dosage given to the mother. Whatever the aminoglycoside, kidneys presented proximal tubular alterations (close to those observed in adults) at protonic microscopy and, with electron microscopy, some modifications of distal tubules and of mature and immature glomeruli. It is concluded that the developing kidney can be altered after treating pregnant mothers with aminoglycosides. This model of in utero-induced nephrotoxicity is dose-dependent. Mature and/or immature structures could be affected. The toxicity of the investigated antibiotics could be asserted as G greater than or equal to N greater than A.\r"

Both groups were either given vehicle or 1.4 IU/day recombinant human growth hormone (GH) by s.c. osmotic minipump, or 2.5 IU twice daily intraperitoneally for 14 or 20 days, respectively. Compared to uremic rats infused with vehicle, infusion of GH significantly (P less than 0.01) improved growth; that is, it increased gain of weight (delta 27.0 +/- 7.7 g vs. 11.6 +/- 4.9 g) and length (delta 1.8 +/- 0.3 cm vs. 1.12 +/- 0.44 cm) in ad libitum fed uremic rats. This was accompanied by increased food utilization ratio (0.146 vs. 0.065 g weight gain per g food intake). A similar increment of growth and food utilization ratio was also observed in GH versus solvent infused controls, either pairfed as for the uremic animals or fed ad libitum. Despite administration of GH, growth was not completely restored to normal in uremic animals. Circulating immunoreactive IGF I was not significantly increased by GH infusion in either uremic animals or controls. Histological analyses of the proximal tibia showed increased rate of longitudinal growth, as evaluated by tetracyclin-labeling, and increased volumetric density of primary spongiosa with unchanged width of primary spongiosa trabecules when GH was infused in uremic animals. The data suggest that growth impairment in the uremic rat is partially responsive to GH, and this is not accompanied by an increase of circulating IGF I. Therapeutic trials with recombinant GH in uremic children appear justified.\r"

Sequential dextran sieving studies were performed after two weeks of nephritis in 10 uninephrectomized rats at their basal elevated blood pressure levels (154 +/- 3 mm Hg) and at lowered renal perfusion pressure of 105 to 110 mm Hg, achieved by adjusting a ligature around the aorta above the origin of the renal artery. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased from 1.35 +/- 0.24 to 0.95 +/- 0.19 ml/min (P less than 0.002), while urinary protein excretion (factored for filtration rate) declined from 0.69 +/- 0.2 to 0.39 +/- 0.1 mg per ml GFR (P less than 0.002) at the lower perfusion pressure. A companion protocol documented a modest reduction in renal plasma flow (RPF) from 4.96 +/- 0.48 to 4.44 +/- 0.63 ml/min (P less than 0.05) and a decline in glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (delta P) from 43 to 33 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) during the ligature maneuver. In the hypertensive state, fractional clearances of neutral dextrans (theta ND) with molecular radii exceeding 40 A were elevated in nephritic rats as compared to uninephrectomized non-nephritic controls. With reduction in renal perfusion pressure. Theta ND uniformly declined toward control values and remained significantly elevated only for molecular radii exceeding 55 A. The calculated fraction of glomerular filtrate passing through a non-size discriminatory shunt, pathway was 0.93% during the hypertensive period and was reduced at lower perfusion pressures to 0.52% (to be compared to 0.19% in controls).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested a role for thromboxane in the progression of renal disease. The current study evaluated the role of this arachidonic acid metabolite in a model of renal disease which bears many biologic similarities to that in the kidneys of patients with chronic progressive renal failure. The model is that induced by ferritin-anti-ferritin immune complex nephritis in Dahl-salt sensitive rats rendered hypertensive by a high salt intake. Rats with this model of renal disease were chronically given a thromboxane synthetase antagonist OKY-046 or a placebo treatment from 16 to 29 weeks of age. Sequential observations of serum creatinine and 24-hour urinary protein excretion showed an ameliorating effect of OKY-046 on these renal parameters. Histologic examination of the kidneys also showed significantly less glomerular sclerosis in OKY-046 treated animals. The efficacy of OKY-046 was monitored by measurements of serum TXB2 levels and of glomerular production of TXB2 (and other prostaglandins); amounts of TXB2 were significantly reduced in the OKY-046 group. It is concluded that blockade of thromboxane generation has been successful in ameliorating the functional and structural lesions in this model of renal disease, providing further support to the thesis that thromboxane is an important mediator in events leading to eventual chronic renal failure and sclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic (30 weeks) structural and functional changes were correlated in diphenylthiazole (DPT)-induced polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in rats. DPT induced two different types of progressive tubular changes: cystic transformation and hyperplastic/atrophic tubular changes. Cystic changes diffusely involved collecting tubules in the outer medulla and cortex, and they were progressive over 30 weeks. Hyperplastic/atrophic changes occurred as clusters of tubules in the cortex and involved between 25% and 50% of tubular profiles after 12 and 30 weeks of drug treatment. Thus, the two types of tubular change were independent of each other and represent different cellular responses to the drug. DPT treatment induced no detectable light- and electron-microscopic or histochemical alterations in glomeruli or renal blood vessels. Renal functional changes consisted of: (1) early (4 weeks) and persistent impairment of concentrating ability; (2) a progressive drop in creatinine clearance and elevation in BUN; and (3) the late onset (30 weeks) of moderate proteinuria. These findings suggest that cystic as well as hyperplastic-atrophic tubular changes contribute to the loss of tubular and renal function in DPT-induced PKD. Both types of tubular lesions may have a role in the development of impaired renal function in other forms of experimental and clinical PKD.\r"

Rats were subjected to either (1) 25% liver ligation, creating a focus of ischemic tissue which was left in place; (2) 25% liver resection; or (3) sham liver ligation. Gentamicin, 80 mg/kg bid, was administered for two days after surgery to all three groups. A fourth group was subjected to 25% liver ligation but no gentamicin therapy. Only rats subjected to partial liver ligation plus gentamicin treatment developed ARF, manifested by azotemia (BUN 80 +/- 2; creatinine 1.63 +/- 0.21; mg/dl) and tubular necrosis. This occurred in the absence of any discernible reduction in arterial blood pressure, renal blood flow, excessive weight loss, or ascites formation. The partial liver ligation-gentamicin group had 70% higher renal gentamicin concentrations than the liver resection-gentamicin controls (P = 0.01). To assess whether factors released from necrotic liver might account for these findings, additional rats were infused with: (1) 1 ml of a soluble liver extract alone; (2) 1 ml of liver extract plus gentamicin; or (3) 1 ml of saline plus gentamicin. Only the liver extract/gentamicin group developed ARF (BUN 88 +/- 13; creatinine 1.46 +/- 0.25). This occurred in association with a 110% increase in renal gentamicin uptake (P less than 0.03). In separate experiments, 5 ml liver extract infusions caused ARF (BUN 118 +/- 7; creatinine 2.1 +/- 0.18) without gentamicin treatment. In conclusion, a focus of liver necrosis can predispose to experimental gentamicin nephrotoxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

BCAA infusion caused moderate renal vasoconstriction, a slight increase of GFR and a progressive rise of the filtration fraction (FF), whereas the amino acids mixture induced a significantly higher increase of GFR and a state of renal vasodilatation without altering the FF. The volume expansion with 0.9% saline did not cause any notable hemodynamic modification except for reduced FF. This study demonstrates that whereas a state of hyperfiltration and hyperemia is specifically induced by an amino acid mixture independently of volume expansion and osmolar load, the administration of BCAA provides nitrogen without renal hemodynamic stimulation.\r"

Local recurrences were seen in 15.2% of the patients following total thyroidectomy and in 16.2% following hemi-thyroidectomy; distant metastases were seen in 10.7% and 11.2%, respectively. Beyond the seventh year of follow-up the cumulative survival was similar following total thyroidectomies, hemi-thyroidectomies, and thyroid resections. Unless grossly malignant residues were left behind, the impact of the surgical procedure on prognosis in papillary thyroid cancer seems minor.\r"

In 175 assays greater than 50% inhibition of colony formation, defined as in vitro sensitivity, was observed for at least one drug. The percent inhibition of the most active single agent closely approximated the percent inhibition of the combination. This relationship was maintained for all tumor types and combinations tested. Resistance in vitro to each drug in a combination predicted resistance to the combination. However, our data suggest that the higher activity of combination chemotherapy relative to single agents is due to an increased probability of finding an agent to which the tumor is sensitive, rather than to a synergistic interaction between drugs.\r"

A reverse ratio of lactate dehydrogenase (LHD) isoenzyme in the cell line and nude mouse-grown tumors was seen predominantly with LDH-V. Chromosomal analysis revealed a heterodiploid stem line with a modal number of 50. Sera of urinary bladder cancer patients reacted with membrane antigens of the TSGH-8301 cells, suggesting the existence of tumor-associated antigens in the cells.

The male:female ratio was 2.7, and the median age was 63 yr for patients with sacrococcygeal and 35.2 yr for those with nonsacral chordomas. After pathologic reassessment, distinct cytologic patterns were found: physaliphorous, syncytial, and mixed subtypes, with variable degrees of cytologic atypia. However, no evident difference in survival was documented in relation to these cytohistologic features. Four cases had a prior traumatic fracture, and the pathogenetic role of trauma is stressed. Eight cases were operated with adequate surgery and only three recurred, whereas of 11 inadequate operations, 10 developed local relapse. However, follow-up for recent adequate operations is short. Radiation therapy seemed to be effective with adjuvant or palliative aims. No chemotherapeutic regimen achieved any result; one case had a short complete remission after cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum + vinblastine + bleomycin (PVB). This analysis confirms the possibility of achieving radicality with high resection of the sacrum for lesions confined below the second sacral vertebra. Nonsacral chordomas were all unresectable. The best treatment for unresectable lesions seems to be palliative surgery plus radiotherapy.\r"

Both 125I and 211At deliver lethal doses of irradiation to melanoma cells when administered as 125IUdR and 211At-AMT. The alpha decay of astatine-211 is more effective however, needing only a fraction of the cellular radioactivity of 125IUdR to effect comparable clonogenic survival. Compared with 125IUdR, 125I-AMT is not cytotoxic because the range of the low energy electrons released does not interact with DNA. Uptake of radiolabeled AMT by melanotic cells is enhanced by theophylline. This preliminary evidence suggests that 211At-labeled melanin precursors may be exquisitely cytotoxic to B16 melanoma cells.\r"

  ".W": "The progression of preneoplasia into lung cancer can be serially studied in a new canine model that is simpler and more cost effective than previously reported methods of orthotopic endobronchial carcinogenesis. Short segments of bronchus, obtained by pneumonectomy, were placed on the back of 10 dogs in the form of subcutaneous bronchial autografts. These autografts (12 to 14 per dog) became vascularized and lined with normal respiratory epithelium. Four to 12 weeks after autograft implantation, 10% methylcholanthrene in crystalline form was put into 57 autografts and 10% methylcholanthrene in a silicone polymer sustained-release implant was placed into 54 autografts. Ten autografts without carcinogen (one per dog) served as controls. Serial samplings of each autograft during 9 to 97 weeks of carcinogen exposure showed the neoplastic progression from normal bronchial cells to invasive cancer through stages such as atypical squamous metaplasia and carcinoma in situ. To date, cancers have been histologically proved in 60 autografts; 36 were induced by implants and 24 by the crystalline form. Thirty-nine cancers were epidermoid, and the remainder were either adenocarcinomas (n = 3) or poorly differentiated spindle cell cancers (n = 18). The sustained-release implant method resulted in larger autografts with a greater tendency to progress to cancer than the crystalline carcinogens (p greater than 0.025). Therefore, the sustained-release implant is now considered the preferred method. Measurement of nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid by image analysis of nine histologic cancers demonstrated hyperploidy. Deoxyribonucleic acid from the L1 repeated sequence family was demonstrably hypomethylated in spindle cell tumors. Curettement of individual autografts yielded sheets of respiratory epithelium from which 43.5 to 409.5 micrograms of deoxyribonucleic acid was isolated. For the first time, deoxyribonucleic acid from each stage of the neoplastic progression in non-small cell lung cancer is available in adequate quantities for serial biochemical and therapeutic analysis.\r"

The bovine pericardial xenograft was modeled after a similar type of prosthesis manufactured by Shiley Inc. (Irvine, Calif.). The late mortality rate in this series was only 1.8% per annum and the actuarial survival rate was 73.0% +/- 12% at 10 years. There was a very acceptable low incidence of thromboembolism of 0.41% per annum without the need for permanent anticoagulation. This is similar to the clinical reports with other tissue valves. The main question is the durability of the tissue prosthesis or, in other words, the freedom from valve-related clinical complications. In this series, the expected actuarial valve durability rate was 75.0% +/- 8.8% at 10 years. Whether this will continue to hold up over the next follow-up period is unclear. Certainly other tissue prostheses have shown significant degeneration rates beginning after the sixth year that have risen progressively thereafter. In any case, given the relatively low probability of thromboembolic phenomenon without anticoagulation, the trade-off of a prosthesis that may not be as durable as the mechanical ones is certainly acceptable.\r"

Regurgitation was the reason given for explantation of all the Ionescu-Shiley valves. The other two valves were removed for technical reasons. All the Ionescu-Shiley valves had commissural tears and there was concomitant gross calcification in 10 of the 16 valves. In addition, an apparent increase in cusp area had caused \"leaflet sagging\". The explanted leaflets were thicker and stiffer than leaflets from an unimplanted valve. These features were confirmed directly with an animal model of subcutaneous implantation. Examination with an electron microscope revealed that these changes in mechanical properties seemed to be linked to fiber separation and infiltration by an amorphous proteinlike matrix. The durability of the glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardium depended on a number of factors. Early and midterm failure appeared to be stress induced. Predisposition to high mechanical stresses near the stent was exacerbated by the changes induced by the host environment. This problem was aggravated further in the Ionescu-Shiley valves by stress concentrations around the hole associated with the holding suture. In the long term, collagen disruption associated with leaflet flexure was followed by secondary calcification at the boundary between the intact and disrupted material.\r"

All 25 patients had positive preoperative diastolic ventricular pressures. Negative ventricular diastolic pressure was detected immediately postoperatively in all 25. The lowest left ventricular negative diastolic pressure was -38 mm Hg, and the lowest right ventricular negative diastolic pressure was -28 mm Hg. Intravenous administration of volume (blood) reduced the right ventricular negative diastolic pressure significantly (from -14.8 +/- 9.2 to -6.4 +/- 6.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and decreased right ventricular rate of pressure rise from 1100 +/- 320 to 380 +/- 180. Left ventricular negative diastolic pressure was not significantly affected (from -17 +/- 11 to -14.7 +/- 11 mm Hg). Left ventricular negative diastolic pressure disappeared spontaneously 6 to 9 hours postoperatively in association with a spontaneous decrease of left ventricular rate of pressure rise (from 3450 +/- 610 to 2100 +/- 660 mm Hg/sec). We conclude that negative right and left ventricular pressures are common findings immediately after surgical relief of outflow obstructions. Hypercontractility is the main reason for these phenomena. Volume load reduces the right ventricular negative diastolic pressure, but has insignificant effect on left ventricular negative diastolic pressure. The pathogenesis of the hypercontractility is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic data on 92 patients with severe isolated aortic stenosis were reviewed to determine the incidence and mechanism of pulmonary hypertension. The status of each of these patients was determined 1 to 8 years after diagnosis by cardiac catheterization. Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure: group 1 (less than or equal to 30 mm Hg), 46 patients; Group 2 (31 to 50 mm Hg), 31 patients; and Group 3 (greater than 50 mm Hg), 15 patients. The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension was 50% (46/92) and that of severe pulmonary hypertension, 16% (15/92). There was no significant difference in age, aortic valve gradient, or valve area among the three groups. There was a significant positive correlation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (group 1, 15.5 +/- 7.2 mm Hg; group 2, 23.3 +/- 8.1 mm Hg; and group 3, 29.5 +/- 5.8 mm Hg; R = 0.56, p less than 0.01). There was also a significant negative correlation in left ventricular ejection fraction (group 1, 67.5% +/- 14%; group 2, 62.3% +/- 13.8%; and group 3 49.9% +/- 18.3%; R = 0.43, p less than 0.01). Of the 92 patients, 85 had aortic valve replacement with four (4.7%) hospital deaths. Follow-up showed excellent symptomatic relief in all three groups. Thirteen of the 15 patients in group 3, with severe pulmonary hypertension, had aortic valve replacement. There were no hospital deaths and only one noncardiac death at follow-up in Group 3 patients, and 11 of the 12 surviving patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I. We conclude that pulmonary hypertension is common in isolated aortic stenosis and is related to an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, frequently with preserved systolic function. Surgical results are excellent.\r"

Sheep (30 kg) were subjected to 1 hour of regional myocardial ischemia by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and assigned to a control (n = 8) or experimental group (n = 5). Control animals were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and the heart arrested with potassium cardioplegia. The left anterior descending artery was released and two additional doses of 100 ml of cardioplegic solution were infused during the total cross-clamp time of 30 minutes. The animals were then weaned from bypass after 1 hour and beating, working reperfusion maintained for an additional 4 hours. The experimental group followed the same protocol except that the cardioplegic solution contained diltiazem (1.4 mg/L). Segmental myocardial function was determined by pairs of ultrasonic crystals in the area at risk, control segment, and minor axis. Global contractility was determined from maximum derivative of left ventricular pressure and cardiac output. The area at risk was determined by injecting monastral blue dye into the left atrium with the left anterior descending artery briefly reoccluded, and the area of necrosis was determined by measuring with a planimeter non-triphenyltetrazolium chloride stained areas in the sectioned left ventricle. After 5 hours of reperfusion, not only did the diltiazem group demonstrate better global contractility as defined by the derivative of left ventricular pressure (1853 +/- 292 versus 979 +/- 191, p = 0.05) but, in addition, the systolic shortening in the ischemic area improved significantly when compared with the control group (9.4 +/- 4 versus 2.13 +/- 0.77, p = 0.05). The group receiving diltiazem cardioplegia had an area of necrosis to area at risk ratio of 31.4% +/- 3%, which was significantly better than this ratio in the control group of 60.75% +/- 7% (p = 0.01). Diltiazem cardioplegia results in improved global and segmental contractility and limits the infarct size after occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and surgical reperfusion.\r"

An isolated working heart model was used. Sets of six hearts from immature (3 to 4 weeks, 500 gm) and mature (24 weeks, 2 kg) rabbits were subjected to 60, 90, or 120 minutes of ischemia. Myocardial protection consisted of infusion of cardioplegic solution every 30 minutes at 4 degrees C in a dose of 10 ml/kg of animal weight and maintenance of hypothermia at 10 degrees C by immersion in a cold saline bath. The percent recovery of preischemic aortic flow was lower in the immature than the mature hearts after 90 minutes (60.3% +/- 7.4% versus 101.8% +/- 4.3%) and after 120 minutes (57.4% +/- 10.6% versus 91.1% +/- 13.6%) of ischemia (results expressed as mean value +/- standard error of the mean, p less than 0.05). There were no differences between the mature and the immature hearts in the recovery of heart rate, left atrial pressure, mean aortic pressure, or glycogen stores. Adenosine triphosphate levels measured at the end of the experiment were not different from control in the immature hearts subjected to 60 or 90 minutes of ischemia, but did decline after 120 minutes of ischemia (18.5 +/- 0.8, 16.9 +/- 1.3, 16.6 +/- 0.6 versus 12.3 +/- 1.8 mumol/gm dry weight, p less than 0.05). Adenosine triphosphate levels in the mature hearts were lower than control in hearts subjected to 60, 90, and 120 minutes of ischemia (18.0 +/- 1.2 versus 13.6 +/- 1.1, 12.8 +/- 0.9, 13.7 +/- 1.5 mumol/gm dry weight, p less than 0.05). Multidose St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia does not provide adequate preservation of hemodynamic function in the immature rabbit heart, even though myocardial high-energy stores are well preserved. Additional work is necessary to clarify the mechanism of this finding and to develop appropriate methods for protection of the immature myocardium.\r"

This study was undertaken (a) to determine the optimal temperature of blood cardioplegia and (b) to study the effect of hematocrit levels in blood cardioplegia. A comparison of myocardial preservation was done among seven groups of animals on the basis of variations in hematocrit levels and temperature of oxygenated cardioplegic solution. The experimental protocol consisted of a 2-hour hypothermic cardioplegic arrest followed by 1 hour of normothermic reperfusion. Group 1 received oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution at 10 degrees C. Groups 2 through 7 received oxygenated blood cardioplegic solution with the following hematocrit values and temperatures: (2) 10%, 10 degrees C; (3) 10%, 20 degrees C; (4) 10%, 30 degrees C; (5) 20%, 10 degrees C; (6) 20%, 20 degrees C; and (7) 20%, 30 degrees C. Parameters studied include coronary blood flow, myocardial oxygen extraction, myocardial oxygen consumption, and myocardial high-energy phosphate levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate during control (prearrest), arrest, and reperfusion. Myocardial oxygen consumption at 30 degrees C during arrest was significantly higher than at 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C, which indicates continued aerobic metabolic activity at higher temperature. Myocardial oxygen consumption and the levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate during reperfusion were similar in all seven groups. Myocardial oxygen extraction (a measure of metabolic function after ischemia) during initial reperfusion was significantly lower in the 30 degrees C blood group than in the 10 degrees C blood group at either hematocrit level and in the oxygenated crystalloid group, which suggests inferior preservation. The hematocrit level of blood cardioplegia did not affect adenosine triphosphate or myocardial oxygen consumption or extraction. It appears from this study that blood cardioplegia at 10 degrees C and oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia at 10 degrees C are equally effective. Elevating blood cardioplegia temperature to 30 degrees C, however, reduces the ability of the solution to preserve metabolic function regardless of hematocrit level. Therefore, the level of hypothermia is important in blood cardioplegia, whereas hematocrit level has no detectable impact, and cold oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia is as effective as hypothermic blood cardioplegia.\r"

After 1 hour of occlusion, the animals were randomized to receive either routine potassium cardioplegia or cardioplegia with superoxide dismutase and catalase. Global hemodynamics measured by maximum rate of pressure rise showed significant improvement after 5 hours of reperfusion in the group treated with superoxide dismutase and catalase (1843 +/- 163 versus 979 +/- 191, p less than 0.001). Regional myocardial function was measured by ultrasonic crystals implanted in the ischemic area and in a nonischemic control segment. The percent systolic shortening or bulging was calculated. At end of reperfusion in the animals treated with superoxide dismutase and catalase, there was active shortening in the ischemic area after reperfusion of +9.2% +/- 0.4% versus 2.1% +/- 0.8% in untreated animals (p less than 0.001). Infarct size measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining showed significant difference (p less than 0.001) between animals treated with superoxide dismutase and catalase (0.9% +/- 0.1%) and control animals (61% +/- 70%). Superoxide dismutase and catalase given in the cardioplegic solution before reperfusion of an acutely ischemic area of myocardium enhances recovery of contractile function and results in a significant reduction in infarct size, which suggests improved salvage of the ischemic myocardium.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether this modality was equally effective in altering reperfusion damage after a period of ischemic arrest. Fourteen pigs were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and subjected to 2 hours of ischemic arrest with multidose potassium crystalloid cardioplegia supplemented with topical and systemic hypothermia (28 degrees C). During arrest, the mid-left anterior descending artery was occluded with a snare, which was released immediately after aortic unclamping. In seven pigs, a 7F balloon-tipped catheter was positioned in the coronary sinus and pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion was performed for 60 minutes after aortic unclamping. Seven other pigs served as controls. Parameters measured included stroke work index, ejection fraction, and myocardial pH in the distribution of the distal left anterior descending artery. Pigs treated with pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion had a significantly higher myocardial pH (6.99 +/- 0.06 versus 6.67 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.01), ejection fraction (50% +/- 2% versus 33% +/- 6%, p less than 0.01), and stroke work index (0.87 +/- 0.07 versus 0.61 +/- 0.05 gm-m/kg, p less than 0.01) after 60 minutes of reperfusion compared with those of the group not treated in this way. We conclude that pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion effectively reverses reperfusion damage after periods of ischemic arrest.\r"

Thirteen adult mongrel dogs underwent normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. A posterorlateral right atriotomy was performed that encircled the upper right atrium but excluded the atrial pacemaker complex. The incision was extended anteromedially to the tricuspid valve anulus just anterior to the membranous interatrial septum and inferiorly just posterior to the os of the coronary sinus and the tricuspid valve anulus. Postoperatively, electrophysiologic data confirmed (1) that the body of the right atrium was electrically isolated from the remainder of the heart, (2) that the sinoatrial node continued to function normally, and (3) that the sinoatrial node remained in continuity with the left atrium and ventricles. Right atrial tachycardia was simulated by rapid right atrial pacing and was confined to the isolated right atrium. Moreover, the simulated tachycardia did not affect normal sinus rhythm or normal atrioventricular conduction. It is concluded that isolation of the right atrium with preservation of normal sinoatrial node function and continuity is feasible. This technique offers an alternative to the current surgical approaches for management of refractory supraventricular tachycardias that arise in the right atrium.\r"

Hemodynamic data recorded under these four conditions showed that (1) during sinus rhythm, synchrony of right atrial contraction had no significant effect on any of the hemodynamic parameters studied and (2) conversion from propagated right atrial tachycardia to confined right atrial tachycardia resulted in an increase in mean arterial pressure (65 +/- 5 to 78 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) and stroke volume index (9 +/- 1 to 19 +/- 3 ml/beat/m2, p less than 0.005) with a decrease in left atrial pressure (9 +/- 2 to 5 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and right atrial pressure (6 +/- 1 to 5 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Moreover, cardiac hemodynamic performance remained within normal limits for up to 14 weeks. Thus the right atrial isolation procedure does not adversely affect cardiac hemodynamics despite the loss of synchronous right atrial contraction during sinus rhythm, and the procedure prevents hemodynamic deterioration during right atrial tachycardia.\r"

All patients received one of five models of the Bjork-Shiley valve. The follow-up was 99.6% complete and covered 10,658 patient-years (mean 6.4 years). An autopsy was performed in 72% of all fatalities. Early mortality was 5.5%. The early mortality rate for patients undergoing isolated, elective aortic valve replacement between 1979 and 1983 was 2.3%. Five-, 10-, and 15-year actuarial survival rates (early mortality excluded) were 85%, 70%, and 54%, respectively, and complication-free survival rates at the same time intervals were 78%, 59%, and 42%. Eighteen percent of the late deaths were considered valve related. Anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was the single most common valve-related complication (1.4/100 patient-years) and the most common valve-related cause of death (0.3/100 patient-years). The incidences of embolism and valve thrombosis were closely related to the efficacy of the anticoagulant program. Fourteen of 19 valve thromboses occurred among 180 patients without anticoagulants. The incidences of embolism and valve thrombosis among 1573 patients with continuous anticoagulant treatment were 0.7 and 0.06/100 patient-years, respectively. Six strut fractures occurred, all in convexo-concave valves. There was no mechanical failure among the Monostrut valves. The incidence of \"prosthetic failure\" (ie, valve-related complications [not leakage] necessitating reoperation or causing the patient's death) was 0.6/100 patient-years. The incidence of embolism and prosthetic failure was similar for the different valve models, and these long-term results might therefore be considered representative for all Bjork-Shiley aortic valves.\r"

  ".W": "To observe microembolic events in the central nervous system during cardiopulmonary bypass, we subjected 21 patients undergoing elective coronary operations to retinal fluorescein angiograms 5 minutes before cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued. Patients with diabetes or clinically evident cerebrovascular disease were excluded. Bubble oxygenation and nonpulsatile perfusion were used for bypass. After 31 to 167 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass, all 21 (100%) patients had retinal microvascular occlusions indicative of microembolism. Control fluorescein angiograms obtained preoperatively and in five patients immediately before bypass but after aortic cannulation showed retinal perfusion. During bypass there was a mean of 3.5 (range 1 to 7) blocked arterioles of less than 50 micron caliber and a mean of 6.3 (range 1 to 10) focal areas of capillary nonperfusion per 30-degree field of retina centered on the macula per patient. Repeat studies 30 minutes after discontinuation of bypass showed partial reperfusion with occlusions in four of the five (80%) patients and a decrease in the mean total microembolic count from 12.6 to 4.8 (38%). In later studies at a median of 8 days postoperatively, only two of 16 (12.5%) patients had persistently occluded retinal vessels. The total microembolic count did not correlate with bypass time (r = 0.14) and was not reduced by arterial line filtration with a Pall 40 micron filter (Ultipore) in a subgroup of 11 patients. Twenty patients completed four standardized psychometric tests. Retinal microvascular occlusions were more numerous in those patients with a psychometric deficit (n = 7) than in those with no deficit (n = 13; p = 0.075). In a dog model of cardiopulmonary bypass, eight of nine (88.9%) had retinal microvascular occlusions after 10 to 90 minutes of bypass. Retinal histologic studies revealed intravascular platelet-fibrin microaggregates 20 to 70 micron in diameter and focal ischemic changes in seven of the nine (77.8%) dogs. Six dogs undergoing sham bypass had normal retinal perfusion and histologic findings. This study demonstrates a very high incidence of microvascular occlusions in the territory of the internal carotid artery during bypass consistent with a microembolic origin. The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain.\r"

Its blood supply is excellent and is capable of inducing neovascularity. Based on the right gastroepiploic artery, it reaches anywhere in the thorax or neck. Its bulk helps to fill infected spaces. Thirty-seven patients have been treated with the pedicled omentum. In 16 patients the goal was preventive, to avoid bleeding, anastomotic leakage, or infection or to provide a source of fibroplasia or neovascularity. In eight patients with cervical exenteration the flap protected against innominate artery erosion and esophageal leakage, generally in an irradiated field. In six patients it permitted primary healing of heavily irradiated trachea--formerly unlikely. It was also used to provide coverage of a chest wall prosthesis in two patients. In 21 patients the omentum was used to obtain healing in the presence of infection. Bronchopleural fistulas were successfully closed in eight of nine patients. Six mediastinal infections that developed after cardiac operations were successfully treated. Four unusual vascular infections necessitated the use of omentum. Two patients had closure of esophageal perforations buttressed with omentum. This series demonstrates the efficacy of the omentum in the management of complex cardiac, vascular, esophageal, tracheal, bronchial, pleural, and chest wall problems.\r"

Eleven of 13 perforations could be managed conservatively. In one child with extrapleural effusion, tube drainage was performed. The only death in this series occurred in a child who was brought for treatment after a 60-hour delay. Thoracotomy and multiple abscess drainage eventually proved unsuccessful. On the basis of our experience with children with esophageal perforation or with complications after esophageal atresia repair, we conclude that management of esophageal perforation in children differs substantially from therapy in adults and necessitates restrictive treatment guided by clinical symptoms.\r"

Eighty-four patients (78%) had previous aortic valve operations. Concomitant cardiac procedures were done in 34 patients (32%). The 30-day mortality rate was 14% (15 patients). The cumulative follow-up period was 180.3 patient-years. The late mortality rate was 6.1% per patient-year (11 patients). The patients were not given anticoagulants postoperatively, but the entire group has been completely free from thromboembolism. The actuarial 5-year survival rate including operative deaths was 72%. The freedom from valve-related death at 5 years after operation is 86% and freedom from reoperation at 5 years is 96%. The use of homografts for replacement of the aortic valve and root in patients with complex lesions affecting these structures has shown encouraging early and late results, with regard to both survival and valve performance.\r"

The longest follow-up is 18 years 7 months, and the cumulative total follow-up is 1130 patient-years (pt-yr). The overall 30-day mortality rate is 6.6% (16 patients), with no deaths after 1976, and the late mortality rate is 1.7%/pt-yr (19 patients). The actuarial survival rate is 57.3% +/- 9.6% at 19 years. No anticoagulation has been used and there have been no thromboembolic episodes. The incidence of bacterial endocarditis is 1.2%/pt-yr (14 patients), and its actuarial event-free rate is 74.2% +/- 8.1% at 19 years. Reoperation because of failure of the pulmonary autograft was performed on 36 patients, 27 of whom needed valve replacement. The incidence of pulmonary autograft replacement is 2.5%/pt-yr, and its actuarial event-free rate is 48.5% +/- 13.7% at 19 years. For reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, 186 aortic homografts, 26 pulmonary homografts, 16 autologous fascia lata valved conduits, 7 autologous pericardial conduits with or without a valve, and 6 xenograft valved Dacron conduits were used. Thirty-one patients were reoperated on, mostly because of degeneration of this material. Pulmonary rather than aortic homografts are now favored for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract Because of its satisfactory long-term result without the need for anticoagulation, as well as its safety as an established surgical procedure, this operation can be recommended to a wider range of patients.\r"

Low birth weight adversely affects survivorship. Hypoxia or heart failure accounts for most deaths within the first month and before the atrial switch (Mustard) repair. Most of the few deaths late postoperatively are sudden and they appear to occur particularly in patients who have junctional rhythm. A progressive increase in the prevalence of junctional rhythm has been a risk of the atrial switch repair, and only 76%, 65%, 59%, 56%, and 53% of patients can be expected to be free of this by 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after repair. Important right ventricular dysfunction late after an atrial switch repair, with its adverse affect on the patients' functional capacity, appears to be present in up to 10% of patients after the atrial switch repair, but may not be an immutable risk of this type of repair. About 90% of patients, essentially all of those who do not have right ventricular dysfunction, can be expected to be in New York Heart Association class I or II late postoperatively.\r"

Mortality rates, likewise age-adjusted, were 0.7 overall and 1.1 and 0.3 for male and female subjects, respectively. These rates are similar to those from tumor registries, a finding that suggests that reporting of these tumors is relatively complete. The similarity of the incidence and the mortality rates is consistent with the high case-fatality rate. A comparison of the Olmsted County cases with Mayo Clinic referral cases provides some evidence for referral bias, as the referral patients were significantly younger and had significantly more high-grade tumors.\r"

Although the patients denied the use of salicylates, all of them had therapeutic blood levels of salicylates. A salicylate level should be determined in patients with severe ulcer disease that is resistant to medical therapy or that is recurrent after appropriate surgical therapy when the presence of hypergastrinemia or hyperchlorhydria has been definitely excluded. A low serum level of uric acid can also be a clue to the abuse of salicylates.\r"

All 50 patients had a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy or had complications of anticoagulation for deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary emboli. The percutaneous placement was accomplished in the angiographic suite with use of local anesthesia and was well tolerated by all patients. Only three complications related to the percutaneous approach occurred during the short-term follow-up (3 months to 1 year). These complications were deep venous thrombosis of the leg in two patients and misplacement of the filter in one patient. The three patients tolerated these complications well. We conclude that placement of Greenfield vena caval filters can be readily accomplished by means of percutaneous entry. Our experience demonstrated minimal associated morbidity and no mortality.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively reviewed a 20-year experience with 59 carotid body tumors in 55 patients examined at our institution in order to determine the long-term results of surgical resection, including the rates of distant metastasis, local recurrence, and long-term survival. Complete surgical excision was possible in 52 of the 55 patients (95%). Perioperative mortality was only 2% (1 of 59 procedures), and no operative deaths occurred during the last 10 years of the study. Survival of patients after resection of a carotid body tumor was equivalent to that for sex- and age-matched control subjects. Only one patient (2%) had development of metastatic disease during long-term follow-up. Three patients (6%) had recurrence of the carotid body tumor after complete excision. All recurrent tumors were observed in patients with multiple paragangliomas or a family history of cervical paragangliomas. Therefore, we advocate early surgical resection of all carotid body tumors in low-risk patients. Such early resection maximizes the possibility of cure and minimizes the risks of neurovascular complications associated with large and neglected tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Chest pain in a young person is often caused by chest wall tenderness, associated with mitral valve prolapse, or attributed to psychologic factors. Ischemic cardiac pain may be overlooked because of its rare occurrence in this age group. A 35-year-old woman complained of substernal chest pressure precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. The symptom had been noted for 15 years. Worsening of the symptom during dancing prompted her to seek medical advice. She had no other illnesses, was taking no medications, was a nonsmoker, and had no family history of coronary disease. Physical examination disclosed a grade 1 (on the basis of 1 to 6) systolic ejection murmur, an ejection click, and a grade 2 diastolic murmur. An exercise test produced symptoms at 4 minutes. Coronary arteriography showed the absence of a left coronary ostium and filling of the entire coronary system from the right ostial injection through collateral vessels from the right coronary artery. Surgical repair was recommended. Operative intervention showed a dysplastic bicuspid aortic valve with a membrane that covered the left coronary ostium. Excision of the membrane reestablished antegrade blood flow to the left coronary system. A follow-up exercise test revealed normal findings. Because chest pain in a young person is rarely ischemic in origin, benign or noncardiac causes are usually considered; however, if the history suggests ischemic pain, the possible presence of unusual cardiovascular abnormalities should not be disregarded.\r"

Cigarette consumption was similar in the two groups. The cadmium workers had an excess of abnormalities of lung function and of radiographic changes consistent with emphysema. Classification of the cadmium workers by exposure categories based on either estimated cumulative cadmium exposure or liver cadmium measured by neutron activation analysis showed that abnormalities of lung function were greatest in those with the highest cumulative cadmium exposure or liver cadmium. The difference in the transfer coefficient (KCO) between cadmium workers and referents increased linearly with increasing cumulative exposure without evidence for a threshold. The estimated mean decrement in KCO for a cadmium worker employed 5 or more years with a cumulative exposure of 2000 yr.microgram.m-3 (exposure to the current UK control limit of 50 micrograms.m-3 for a working lifetime of 40 yr) lies between 0.05 and 0.3 mmol.min-1.kPa-1.l-1 (95% confidence interval). This decrement is consistent with the functional and radiological changes of emphysema observed in this group of workers.\r"

In 8 of 9 cases of broad complex supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) the arrhythmia was terminated, converted into a narrow complex SVT, or atrioventricular block was induced. In all 9 cases of narrow complex SVT, the arrhythmia was stopped, or atrioventricular block was induced. The arrhythmia was stopped in only 1 of 17 cases of ventricular tachycardia. 6 patients with atrial fibrillation and ventricular pre-excitation were given adenosine, with no effect on mean ventricular rate (averaged over 3 s), although a significant, but short-lived, reduction in minimum RR interval was observed (from 242 ms, SD 45, to 217 ms, SD 39). The mean dose of adenosine required to stop the arrhythmia or to induce atrioventricular block in broad complex SVT (0.14 mg/kg, SD 0.04) was higher than in narrow complex SVT (0.11 mg/kg, SD 0.04). No adverse haemodynamic effects were observed in any patient, and large doses were tolerated by the patients with ventricular tachycardia. The data show that adenosine has a useful role in the diagnosis and treatment of regular broad complex tachycardia.\r"

Multivariate analysis was used to delineate the prognostic roles of several clinical features at diagnosis. A multiple regression analysis was applied to an exponential model for survival-time distribution, which proved to fit the data accurately. Several clinical characteristics were studied and those that could singly discriminate survival significantly were chosen as predictive variables for the multiple regression. These were: sex, age, stage, histological subtype, presence of constitutional symptoms, mediastinal mass, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and haemoglobin and serum albumin concentrations. ESR, stage, histological subtype, and age proved to be the best prognostic factors, while sex and albumin had minor value. The presence of symptoms, mediastinal bulk, and haemoglobin were not so important. A linear equation for the six variables was derived to calculate the estimated median survival time for any given patient. This equation was validated on an external group of 179 similar patients.\r"

The mean time taken by the patient unit to dial and activate the base station was 20.3 seconds. The mean defibrillator charge time was 5.5 seconds to 50 joules and 9.3 seconds to 360 joules. A total of 84 synchronised and 5 unsynchronised shocks were delivered satisfactorily. Lay persons were trained to use the patient unit, and were able to operate the device at home. This device has the potential for rapid defibrillation of patients who develop ventricular fibrillation outside hospital.\r"
