  ".U": "91118926\r", 
  ".W": "From the collection described by Abidi et al., 102 yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) with human DNA inserts more than 300 kb in length were assigned to chromosomal band positions on early metaphase chromosomes by in situ hybridization using the biotin-avidin method. All the YACs hybridized within the Xq24-Xqter region, supporting the origin of the vast majority of the YACs from single human X-chromosomal sites. With assignments precise to +/- 0.5 bands, YACs were distributed among cytogenetic bands to roughly equal extents. Thus, there is no gross bias in the cloning of DNA from different bands into large YACs. To test band assignments further, hybridizations were carried out blind, and band positions were then compared with (1) probe localizations in cases in which a reported location was present in one of the YACs; (2) cross-hybridization of a labeled YAC with others in the collection; and (3) hybridization to a panel of DNAs from a series of hybrid cells containing Xq DNA truncated at various regions. Of 31 cases in which YACs contained a probe with a previously reported location, 28 in situ assignments were in agreement, and 14 other assignments, including one of the three discordant with probe localization, were confirmed by YAC cross-hybridization studies. Results with a group of nine YACs were further confirmed with a panel of somatic cell hybrid DNAs from that region. Five YACs hybridized both to Xq25 and to a second site (four in Xq27 and one in Xq28), suggestive of some duplication of DNA of the hybrid cell and perhaps in normal X chromosomes. The in situ assignments are thus sufficient to place YACs easily and systematically within bins of about 7-10 Mb and to detect some possible anomalies. Furthermore, on the basis of expectations for random cloning of DNA in YACs, the assigned YACs probably cover more than 50% of the total Xq24-Xq28 region. This provides one way to initiate the assembly of YAC contigs over extended chromosomal regions.\r"

  ".W": "Since the cloning of the cDNA for X-linked ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) in 1984, diagnostic accuracy of OTC deficiency for prenatal and carrier detection has been greatly improved by the use of linkage analysis. However, the use of RFLP-based diagnosis is limited in this and in other new mutation diseases. Here we report both the use of direct mutation detection by new PCR-based techniques and our experience with linkage-based diagnosis in 18 families. We have previously reported the use of chemical mismatch cleavage to detect mutations first in amplified mRNA and then in genomic DNA of patients. This technique has now been utilized for prenatal diagnosis. Primers for specific amplification of OTC exons 1, 3, 5, 9, and 10 have been developed and been employed to map deletions of the OTC gene in two families. These primers also have been used to detect alterations in the TaqI sites found in exons 1, 3, 5, and 9. Four novel mutations of the OTC gene leading to abolition of a TaqI site in the OTC cDNA were discovered. One of these mutations is in exon 1; two lie in exon 3; and one is in exon 9. In addition, we have used the PCR products as probes to identify the exon-specific bands seen on Southern blots and to map the polymorphic BamHI and MspI sites, which are commonly used for linkage analysis. This information will facilitate the interpretation of altered band patterns seen in deletion cases and in cases of point mutations affecting restriction sites. Utilization of the appropriate combination of these molecular techniques permitted accurate diagnostic evaluations in 17 of 18 families.\r"

  ".U": "91118930\r", 
  ".W": "The gene causing cystic fibrosis (CF) has been recently cloned, and the major mutation (delta F508) accounting for approximately 70% of CF chromosomes has been uncovered. We have identified at the 3' end of intron 6 in the CF gene a 4-bp tandem repeat (GATT) that exhibits interesting features. First, PCR screening of 103 normal individuals revealed that the repeat exists only in two polymorphic allelic forms, either as a hexamer or a heptamer. These two alleles are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and predict a heterozygote frequency of 41% (p[seven repeats] = .71; q [six repeats] = .29). Second, the allele with six repeats was found linked to delta F508 on all 76 CF chromosomes investigated, demonstrating strong linkage disequilibrium and suggesting that delta F508 had originated on the gene bearing six repeats. Third, when the repeat alleles are linked to the DNA markers XV2c and KM19, extended haplotypes are generated. These new haplotypes become informative in situations in which prenatal diagnosis cannot be performed solely with XV2c and KM19. Since this repeat marker is located in the CF gene and would be very less likely to recombine with the gene, it can serve as a valuable DNA marker for haplotype analysis. A possible crossover, however, was identified between XV2c and KM19, transferring delta F508 to a different haplotype.\r"

The data set is based on 4,730 histologically confirmed breast cancer cases aged 20 to 54 years and on 4,688 controls who were frequency matched to cases on the basis of both geographic region and 5-year categories of age, and it includes family histories, obtained through interviews of cases and controls, of breast cancer in mothers and sisters. Segregation analysis and goodness-of-fit tests of genetic models provide evidence for the existence of a rare autosomal dominant allele (q = .0033) leading to increased susceptibility to breast cancer. The effect of genotype on the risk of breast cancer is shown to be a function of a woman's age. Although, compared with noncarriers, carriers of the allele appear to be at greater risk at all ages, the ratio of age-specific risks is greatest at young ages and declines steadily thereafter. The proportion of cases predicted to carry the allele is highest (36%) among cases aged 20-29 years. This proportion gradually decreases to 1% among cases aged 80 years or older. The cumulative lifetime risk of breast cancer for women who carry the susceptibility allele is predicted to be high, approximately 92%, while the cumulative lifetime risk for noncarriers is estimated to be approximately 10%.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) has a complex pattern of genetic inheritance. In addition to genes mapping to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), several lines of evidence point to the existence of other genetic susceptibility factors. Recent studies of the nonobese diabetic mouse (NOD) model of IDDM have suggested the presence, on mouse chromosome 9, of a susceptibility gene linked to the locus encoding the T-cell antigen, Thy-1. A region on human chromosome 11q is syntenic to this region on mouse chromosome 9. We have used a set of polymorphic DNA markers from chromosome 11q to investigate this region for linkage to a susceptibility gene in 81 multiplex diabetic pedigrees. The data were investigated by maximization of lod scores over genetic models and by multiple-locus affected-sib-pair analysis. We were able to exclude the presence of a susceptibility gene (location scores less than -2) throughout greater than 90% of the chromosome 11q homology region, under the assumption that the susceptibility factor would cause greater than 50% of affected sib pairs to share two alleles identical by descent. Theoretical estimates of the power to map susceptibility genes with a high-resolution map of linked markers in a candidate region were made, using HLA as a model locus. This result illustrates the feasibility that IDDM linkage studies using mapped sets of polymorphic DNA markers have, both for other areas of the genome in IDDM and for other polygenic diseases. The analytic approaches introduced here will be useful for affected-sib-pair studies of other complex phenotypes.\r"

A total of 3,500 cosmids were isolated by colony hybridization with labeled human genomic DNA. DNA was prepared from 130 of these cosmid clones and examined for RFLP. In 62 of them, polymorphism was detected with one or more enzymes; four RFLPs were VNTR systems. All polymorphic clones were assigned to one of 22 intervals obtained by mapping on a deletion panel of 15 somatic hybrid cell lines containing parts of chromosome 11; 11 clones were finely mapped by in situ hybridization. Although RFLP markers were scattered on the whole chromosome, they were found predominantly in the regions of R-banding. These DNA markers will contribute to fine mapping of genes causing inherited disorders and tumor-suppressor genes that reside on chromosome 11. Furthermore, as one-third of the cosmid clones revealed a band or bands in Chinese hamster DNA, indicating sequence conservation, this subset of clones may be useful for isolating biologically important genes on chromosome 11.\r"

Pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis using localized chromosome 6 probes and chromosome 16 probes in 12 unrelated TCS families with multiple affected siblings excluded the TCS locus from proximity to both translocation breakpoints.

None of the DMD or intermediate patients demonstrated an immunoreactive dystrophin band when immunostained with an antiserum specific for the carboxy terminus of the protein. In contrast, dystrophin was detected in both BMD patients by the antiserum specific for the carboxy terminus. Quantitative studies indicated that the relative abundance of dystrophin in patients with a severe (DMD), intermediate, or mild (BMD) phenotype may overlap, therefore suggesting that differential diagnosis of disease severity based entirely on dystrophin quantitation may be unsatisfactory. Our results suggest that a differential diagnosis between DMD and BMD would benefit from examination of both the N terminus and C terminus of the protein, in addition to measurements of the relative abundance of the protein.\r"

Nuclease S1 probe protection experiments with mRNA demonstrated that the pro alpha 2(I) chains were shortened because of a deletion of most or all of the 54 nucleotides in exon 6, the exon that contains codons for the cleavage site for procollagen N-proteinase. Sequencing of genomic clones revealed a single-base mutation that converted the first nucleotide of intron 6 from G to A. Therefore, the mutation was a change, in the -GT-consensus splice site, that produced efficient exon skipping. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridizations demonstrated that the proband's mother, father, and brother did not have the mutation. Therefore, the mutation was a sporadic one. Analysis of potential 5' splice sites in the 5' end of intron 6 indicated that none had favorable values by the two commonly employed techniques for evaluating such sites. The proband is the fourth reported proband with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome VII with a single-base mutation that causes skipping of exon 6 in the splicing of RNA from either the COL1A1 gene or COL1A2 gene. No other mutations in the two type I procollagen genes have been found in the syndrome. Therefore, such mutations may be a common cause of the phenotype. The primers developed should be useful in screening for the same or similar mutations causing the disease.\r"

Two-point analysis with a DNA probe for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), which maps to Xq13, suggested linkage to the disorder by a lod score of at least 2.60 at a recombination fraction of zero. The disease in this kindred appears to be clinically and genetically distinct from that in previously reported families with X-linked hereditary ataxia or spastic paraparesis. No mapping data are available for inherited X-linked sideroblastic anemia without neurologic abnormalities. However, structural alterations of band Xq13 may be involved in the development of idiopathic acquired sideroblastic anemia. No alterations in the restriction patterns of two X-linked genes involved in erythrocyte formation-i.e., a DNA-binding protein (GF-1) and 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS)-were detected in DNA from affected males, arguing against a large deletion in either of these candidate genes.\r"

  ".U": "91118943\r", 
  ".W": "Maple syrup urine disease in humans results from inherited defects in branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial multienzyme complex. A variety of genetic changes may produce this phenotype by affecting the function of any of the three complex-specific subunits. The varied clinical expression observed in patients may be partially explained by the defects in the involved subunit. Here we report localization of the gene for the branched chain acyltransferase component of the complex to human chromosome 1 and describe a proband who is a compound heterozygote at this locus. One allele, inherited from the father, produces transcripts with 124 nucleotides deleted from the coding region. The deletion is not found in the branched chain acyltransferase gene, implying that the deleted transcripts arise by an error in transcript processing. Cells from the patient's mother contain 50% of the normal amount of mRNA for the subunit, and the proband has inherited this nonexpressing allele from her. As a result, the proband produces no acyltransferase protein and therefore has greatly impaired complex activity. A phenotypically normal sibling is shown to be genetically similar to the mother having inherited the mother's nonexpressing allele and the father's normal allele.\r"

The tentatively calculated number of copies for this cDNA appeared to be about four times as many as that of the antithrombin III gene specified by a single locus in the human haploid genome. Southern analysis using H-protein cDNA probe demonstrates a deletion of the 5.0-kb SacI fragment in the genome of a patient with an atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia in whom there was an inactive H-protein. This SacI fragment was also deleted from the genome of one of seven patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia resulting from the lesion of glycine decarboxylase. The remaining six patients had common aberrations identified with the 5.2-kb EcoRI and 5.5-kb SacI fragments. Although implication of these defective fragments in pathogenesis is unclear at present, it is suggested that rearrangements occur in multiple genomic loci of patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia and that this H-protein cDNA can be used for carrier screening.\r"

It was discovered in Hutterites, a reproductively isolated religious sect, and is also present in Australian aborigines and a sample of Chicago residents. A two-allele model is consistent with the segregation pattern observed in five kindreds within our initial study group. This polymorphism, provisionally designated SPPM-158, appears as a horizontal (charge-based) doublet in silver-stained ISO-DALT high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis gels. It is a low-concentration polypeptide (approximately 1 mg/dL) that has an apparent MWSDS of 43.6 kD and an isoelectric point of approximately 5.5. We infer that it circulates as a multimer or in a high-molecular-weight (greater than 200 kD) complex with other proteins because it is not observed in normal body fluids derived from physiologically ultrafiltered plasma such as amniotic fluid, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid; however, it is present in urine of patients with glomerular proteinuria. The high heterozygosity rates imply utility of this new serum protein marker for both forensic and population studies.\r"

The technique uses hybridization of sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes to DNA sequences that have been amplified by PCR. The nucleotide sequences of the two hypervariable segments of the mtDNA control region from 52 individuals were determined; these sequences were then used to define nine regions suitable for SSO typing. A total of 23 SSO probes were used to detect sequence variants at these nine regions in 525 individuals from five ethnic groups (African, Asian, Caucasian, Japanese, and Mexican). The SSO typing revealed an enormous amount of variability, with 274 mtDNA types observed among these 525 individuals and with diversity values, for each population, exceeding .95. For each of the nine mtDNA regions significant differences in the frequencies of sequence variants were observed between these five populations. The mtDNA SSO-typing system was successfully applied to a case involving individual identification of skeletal remains; the probability of a random match was approximately 0.7%. The potential useful applications of this mtDNA SSO-typing system thus include the analysis of individual identity as well as population genetic studies.\r"

The normal Japanese sequence is identical to--and the chimpanzee sequence differs by only three nucleotides from--a previously published normal Caucasian sequence. In contrast, the two human mutant sequences each differ from the normal apo C-II gene sequence by several nucleotides, including deletions. The data suggest that both mutant alleles arose greater than 500,000 years ago. It is shown that a defective allele can persist in a population for only a short time if a bottleneck occurs. Therefore, the antiquity of the two alleles suggests no severe bottleneck during human evolution. Moreover, the fact that one allele is from Japan and the other is from a Venezuelan Caucasian family is more consistent with the multiregional evolution model of modern human origins than with the complete replacement or \"out of Africa\" model.\r"

In order to find out whether this marked resistance against malaria has a genetic basis, we have now determined in these populations the prevalence of candidate protective genes and have performed in-vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum in both Tharu and non-Tharu red cells. We have found significant but relatively low and variable frequencies of beta-thal, beta S, G6PD (-), and Duffy (a-b-) in different parts of the Terai region. The average in-vitro rate of invasion and of parasite multiplication did not differ significantly in red cells from Tharus versus those from non-Tharu controls. By contrast, the frequency of alpha-thalassemia is uniformly high in Tharus, with the majority of them having the homozygous alpha-/alpha-genotype and an overall alpha-thal gene (alpha-) frequency of .8. We suggest that holoendemic malaria has caused preferential survival of subjects with alpha-thal and that this genetic factor has enabled the Tharus as a population to survive for centuries in a malaria-holoendemic area. From our data we estimate that the alpha-thal homozygous state decreases morbidity from malaria by about 10-fold. This is an example of selection evolution toward fixation of an otherwise abnormal gene.\r"

Genetic distances are closer to linguistic than to geographic distances. Gene-frequency change across 12 linguistic boundaries is significantly more rapid than at random locations. The zones of sharp genetic variation correspond to physical barriers to gene flow and to boundaries between dialect families, which overlap widely. However, two linguistically differentiated populations appear genetically differentiated despite the absence of physical obstacles to gene flow around them. The Po River is associated with abrupt genetic change only in the area where it corresponds to a dialect boundary. At most loci the genetic population structure seems affected by linguistic rather than geographic factors; exceptions are the systems that were subject to malarial selection in geographically close but linguistically heterogeneous localities. Gene flow appears to homogenize gene frequencies within regions corresponding to dialect families but not between them, leading to the patchy distributions of allele frequencies that were detected in an earlier study.\r"

We have found that the mutations underlying Tay-Sachs disease in Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews are different. Analysis of a Moroccan Jewish Tay-Sachs patient had revealed an in-frame deletion (delta F) of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons that are present at positions 304 and 305 in the alpha-subunit sequence. The mutation impairs the subunit assembly of beta-hexosaminidase A, resulting in an absence of enzyme activity. The Moroccan patient was found also to carry, in the other alpha-subunit allele, a different, and as yet unidentified, mutation which causes a deficit of mRNA. Analysis of obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families showed that three harbor the delta F mutation, raising the possibility that this defect may be a prevalent mutation in this ethnic group.\r"

By experimentally intervening at a community level to modify risk behavior norms, it may be possible to promote generalized reductions in HIV risk practices within a population. METHODS. We trained persons reliably identified as popular opinion leaders among gay men in a small city to serve as behavior change endorsers to their peers. The opinion leaders acquired social skills for making these endorsements and complied in talking frequently with friends and acquaintances. Before and after intervention, we conducted surveys of men patronizing gay clubs in the intervention city and in two matched comparison cities. RESULTS. In the intervention city, the proportion of men who engaged in any unprotected anal intercourse in a two-month period decreased from 36.9 percent to 27.5 percent (-25 percent from baseline), with a reduction from 27.1 percent to 19.0 percent (-30 percent from baseline) for unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Relative to baseline levels, there was a 16 percent increase in condom use during anal intercourse and an 18 percent decrease in the proportion of men with more than one sexual partner. Little or no change was observed among men in the comparison cities over the same period of time. CONCLUSIONS. Interventions that employ peer leaders to endorse change may produce or accelerate population behavior changes to lessen risk for HIV infection.\r"

Using an anonymous, mailed questionnaire on substance use, we surveyed 500 physicians, 510 pharmacists, and 974 of their students. The physicians and pharmacists were selected randomly from the state society's membership lists, and students selected were from local school lists. Follow-up surveys were sent to nonresponders at two-week intervals. RESULTS. The physicians and medical students did not drink especially heavily and were no more vulnerable to alcoholism than were their counterparts in pharmacy and other professions. Physicians differed from pharmacists in their style of drinking (greater frequency, smaller quantity), but not in total amount of alcohol consumed. Drinking habits among physicians were not associated with medical specialty or type of practice, but were positively related to gender (males drank more than females) and to age (older doctors were more apt to qualify as heavy drinkers than were younger doctors). CONCLUSIONS. Physicians were no more likely to abuse substances nonmedically than were other professionals. Any group in which alcohol use is nearly universal incurs a risk of abuse and impairment that cannot be ignored.\r"

Serum lipids were measured in blood collected by venipuncture at baseline, four weeks, and eight weeks. Baseline mean total cholesterol (TC) levels were 6.56 mmol/L and 6.39 mmol/L for intervention and control groups, respectively. After eight weeks, mean serum total cholesterol of the intervention group was lower by -0.40 mmol/L, and mean net difference in TC between the two groups was 0.32 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.09, 0.54). Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was similarly reduced with mean net difference of 0.25 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.02, 0.48) between the two groups. Mean soluble fiber intake increased along with slight self-imposed reductions in mean total fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol intake in the intervention group. Neither group changed mean body weight. Daily inclusion of two ounces of oats appeared to facilitate reduction of serum total cholesterol and LDL-C in these hyperlipidemic individuals.\r"

  ".W": "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has proposed a surveillance case definition for work-related carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The case definition requires the presence of median nerve symptoms; one or more occupational risk factors; and objective evidence of CTS including one of three physical examination findings or nerve conduction tests diagnostic of CTS. We evaluated the performance of the NIOSH case definition, restricting our analysis to cases in which physical examination findings served as the objective criterion. Nerve conduction studies were used as the gold standard. Seventy-eight workers were studied; 38 percent had CTS. The NIOSH case definition had sensitivity of 0.67 (95% CI = 0.57, 0.77), specificity of 0.58 (95% CI = 0.47, 0.69), and positive and negative predictive values of 0.50 (95% CI = 0.39, 0.61) and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64, 0.84), respectively. Overall 38 percent of subjects were classified incorrectly. In a sample with a prevalence of 15 percent, as might be encountered in high risk workplaces, the positive predictive value would be 0.22. In conclusion, when physical examination findings serve as the objective criterion the performance of the case definition is modest reflecting the limited diagnostic value of its component tests and indicating that effective screening for CTS awaits improved diagnostic techniques.\r"

The potential fragmentation of the specialty is the most significant problem currently faced by general surgeons. Other areas affecting the future of general surgery are discussed, including residency requirements, manpower analyses, and physician reimbursement.

In these countries, the Workmen's Compensation Board restricts treatment privileges to trauma surgeons. In Switzerland and Holland, general surgeons in regional hospitals and to some extent also in university centers have largely remained responsible for trauma, including fractures. In Great Britain, as in other major European countries like France, Italy, and Spain, trauma of the locomotor system is the domain of orthopedic surgeons, with multiple trauma and body cavities remaining the responsibility of general surgeons. Overall, there is a general tendency to create integrated trauma care systems within large hospital settings. Although an experienced general surgeon can function as the leader of the trauma team, such implementation has, for the most part, not occurred.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic response to injury occurs after a diverse group of surgical injuries including major surgical intervention, shock, infection, and sources of inflammation such as pancreatitis. The response is mediated by the macroendocrine system, the autonomic nervous system, and the cell-cell communication system. The clinical manifestations include now well-described clinical, physiologic, and metabolic characteristics. The approach of aggressive source control, invasive circulatory resuscitation, and nutrition/metabolic support has been associated with an overall reduction in morbidity and mortality. In those patients who do not respond to this approach, the disease process progresses to multiple organ failure syndrome with its associated high mortality. Altering the route of feeding, preventing single nutrient and generalized nutrient deficiency, and reducing nosocomial infections with selective gut decontamination have not significantly altered the course or outcome of the disease process in this latter group of patients with persistent hypermetabolism. The available data support the position that this persistent hypermetabolism represents abnormal metabolic regulation resulting in persistence of the inflammatory response with associated suppression of the immune defenses. A number of research approaches are being taken to understand and modulate this abnormal state of regulation. Because of the role of specific nutrients in these regulatory processes, beyond their role in classic nutrition support, nutrients such as arginine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and RNA are being evaluated for their ability to modulate inflammation and to improve immune function. Preliminary results are encouraging.\r"

Choledochoscopic biopsies and incisional biopsies have given the highest yield of positive diagnoses.

There is no specific diagnostic test for ARDS; the condition is characterized by interstitial lung edema, reduction in lung compliance, alveolar and small airway closure, decrease in functional residual capacity, and persistent hypoxia with increasing amounts of pulmonary blood flow coursing through nonventilated or poorly ventilated alveoli. Recent studies have emphasized the roles of macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in lung defense and injury. Advances in understanding the pathophysiology of ARDS have produced little significant change in the clinical management of the syndrome. There is no specific treatment for ARDS. The cornerstone of therapy is the early recognition and elimination of initiating factors such as sepsis. ARDS is not a single disease process, but appears to represent a final common pathway for the manifestation of a variety of lung injuries. The goal of therapy is to eliminate the predisposing condition and support the patient. New modes of ventilatory and pharmacologic therapy are presented.\r"

  ".W": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) can be thought of as the third component of the autonomic nervous system. It is a vast network of neurons widely dispersed throughout the gut. The ENS is a dominant regulator of gut function through the action of peptide and non-peptide neurotransmitters. The most intensively studied roles of the ENS have been the regulation of secretory processes, such as gastric acid secretion, and motility. It is clear, however, that the ENS plays a broader role in the regulation of other gut functions, including mucosal defense, the gut immune response, and sphincter function. Alterations in the regulation of gut function by the ENS are likely or suspected in a number of conditions, including achalasia, Hirschsprung's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Chagas' disease, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, biliary dyskinesia, tachygastria, and irritable bowel syndrome. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of these troublesome conditions makes effective therapy more likely in the future.\r"

While the search for better targeted immunosuppressive regimens continues, we must seek to improve our ability to both diagnose and treat those infections that do occur after transplantation. Viral infections in general, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in particular, represent an area in which substantial progress is being made. Improvement in diagnostic modalities has allowed more rapid and precise identification of CMV infection and disease, and the use of antiviral agents that possess activity against CMV has allowed both prophylaxis and treatment of this frequently life-threatening disease. The prophylactic use of presently available agents in combination and the development of less toxic, more potent anti-CMV agents should serve to further lessen the impact of CMV disease upon the field of solid organ transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this paper is to describe the technique, indications, and results of the Roux operation as used in the treatment of postgastrectomy syndromes. A Roux gastrojejunostomy with a 40-cm Roux limb is the procedure of choice for alkaline reflux gastritis, because it virtually eliminates reflux of bile and pancreatic juice into the stomach. The slow transit through a Roux limb can also be used to good advantage to slow gastric emptying in patients with dumping. Patients with delayed gastric emptying respond to the combination of near-total gastric resection, which removes the atonic gastric remnant and speeds emptying, and Roux-Y gastrojejunostomy, which prevents reflux esophagitis and provides a reservoir for ingesta in the upper gut. After all Roux operations, however, the Roux limb may slow emptying so much that pain, fullness, nausea, and food vomiting result, the so-called Roux stasis syndrome. Prevention of the Roux stasis syndrome with an \"uncut\" Roux limb and the treatment of the syndrome by using electrical pacing to suppress the ectopic pacemakers that emerge in the limb offer possible new solutions to this vexing problem.\r"

The value of the germfree approach to surgical problems has been utilized in studies of a variety of gastrointestinal problems, shock, cancer, immunology, burns, wound healing, and in direct patient application. Patients have been maintained in isolator environments for prevention of infection, for operative procedures, for treatment of extensive burns, and for management of immune-suppressed individuals.

Bowel atrophy and cecal bacterial overgrowth have both been implicated in the pathophysiology of bacterial translocation in many of these models. To further define the etiology of bacterial translocation resulting from dietary manipulations, rats were fed a elemental/defined-formula diet (DFD) for 2 weeks ad libitum and then randomized to either intestinal decontamination with a nonabsorbable antibiotic (neomycin) or no antibiotic treatment. Neomycin treatment significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced the incidence of bacterial translocation after DFD, in association with a significant reduction in the number of cecal gram-negative bacteria. Neither loss of bowel mass after DFD nor bowel composition was affected by oral neomycin. Bacterial translocation after DFD would thus appear to be the result of cecal bacterial overgrowth rather than a loss of a physical intestinal barrier due to atrophy.\r"

We also surveyed all anaesthetists in three major hospitals to ascertain their techniques for this method of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced in all patients with thiopentone and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. The first group received 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide as carrier gases, a second group a few normal breaths of 100% oxygen during thiopentone administration followed by 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide, while a third group received 100% oxygen after loss of eyelash reflex until spontaneous breathing was established. No patient received positive pressure ventilation before spontaneous breathing was established. Six of the 10 patients in the first group became hypoxaemic compared to none in the second group, and three patients became hypoxaemic in the third group. Thirty-seven percent of anaesthetists who responded to the survey either did not apply positive pressure ventilation before establishment of spontaneous breathing, or only did so if apnoea was prolonged. Only one anaesthetist fully pre-oxygenated patients lungs. We conclude that to avoid the likely occurrence of hypoxaemia during induction of mask anaesthesia, a minimum of a few breaths pre-oxygenation is necessary.\r"

The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was 31%. The higher the scores in the palm test, the more difficult was the laryngoscopy. The correlation coefficient between these two factors was r = 0.6 (p less than 0.001).

All patients self-administered intravenous morphine using a patient-controlled analgesia device. There was a highly significant difference in mean morphine consumption between the groups (72 mg as compared with 22 mg). Visual analogue pain scores tended to be lower in the bupivacaine group throughout and this was significant at 2 hours. Respiratory function measurements were not significantly different between the groups. The mean peak venous plasma bupivacaine concentration after the sixth dose was 3.03 micrograms/ml and no symptoms suggestive of local anaesthetic toxicity occurred. It is concluded that this regimen can provide effective and continuous analgesia after cholecystectomy and that combined administration of interpleural bupivacaine and systemic morphine is more effective than morphine alone in the immediate postoperative period. The doses of bupivacaine required for optimal use of the technique lead to significant total plasma bupivacaine concentrations within 24 hours.\r"

They can achieve a potential 'stored volume' if occluded and they may, as part of the administration set, retard fluid administration. Seven antireflux systems currently available were tested in conjunction with three patient-controlled analgesia pumps. The systems' volume, time to occlusion alarm and flow rates were measured. Results showed that the sets with low stored volumes were less efficient as administration sets. A potentially dangerous bolus could result after release of occlusion if sets with large stored volumes were used in conjunction with pumps that utilised concentrated solutions of opioid. This study has identified the ideal antireflux valve system.\r"

The Ohmeda 9000 pump has undergone bench testing and detailed evaluation in clinical practice using a variety of syringe sizes and makes. It is capable of accurate delivery over a range of infusion rates provided the recommended manufacturers' syringes are used with the appropriate pump setting. The pump was easy to use and reliable in clinical research and routine clinical practice. It should find its niche as the first genuinely 'anaesthetist-friendly' infusion pump.\r"

Eighty ASA 1 and 2 patients aged 18-65 years were asked to list the advantages and disadvantages of using patient-controlled analgesia. The most important advantage as perceived by patients was the reduced time spent by nurses in giving medication, but there was concern that direct personal contact would also be lessened. Preservation of self control, autonomy, rapid onset of analgesia, ability to titrate analgesia and lack of injections were seen as an advantage. Addiction and machine faults were seen as minimal problems. Preservation of patient-nurse contact is of great importance to ensure success of postoperative analgesia.\r"

A bolus dose of 0.02 mg/kg (1 ml) and a lockout interval of 10 minutes were the initial settings. The dose used, pain and sedation scores, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded. Ages ranged from 5-15 years (mean 9.6) and the method was used for a mean of 48 hours after operation. Morphine requirements averaged 26 (micrograms/kg)/hour (SD 10.6). Pain control was good and sedation minimal. Adverse effects were few and minor. Education of patients, parents and nurses is essential for its success and safety. The technique is an effective and safe means of providing good quality analgesia in school age children.\r"

The quality of sleep was assessed at 0700 hours from responses to a questionnaire, and psychomotor function by comparing paper and pencil (p-deletion) and Maddox Wing tests with reference values from the day before. The three hypnotics were equally effective as sleep medication for time until onset of sleep, duration of sleep and condition upon awakening, whereas zopiclone provided significantly fewer (p less than 0.05) spontaneous awakenings. The p-deletion test did not differ in any of the three groups from the reference values. The ocular imbalance test in all three groups was significantly different (p less than 0.01) from control. The lormetazepam group scored significantly better (p less than 0.05) than the zopiclone group. No side effects were seen.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports the intraoperative use of contrast and Doppler echocardiography techniques to diagnose patent foramen ovale (PFO). Fifty patients without known atrial septal defects undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery were studied. A 5-MHz esophageal echocardiographic probe was used to image the fossa ovalis (FO) and 10 ml agitated saline was injected into the right atrium during apnea. Echocardiographic contrast was then injected during end-inspiration at 20-cmH2O airway pressure. When opacification of the right atrium was complete, the airway pressure was released. During these maneuvers, color and pulsed-wave Doppler interrogation of the atrial septum were also performed. Right-to-left passage of saline contrast across the interatrial septum was seen in 11 of 50 patients (22%). Doppler echocardiography demonstrated a PFO in 2 patients without contrast evidence of shunting. Thus, the combination of contrast and Doppler echocardiography identified a 26% (13 of 50) prevalence of PFO, approximating the previously reported autopsy rate of 25%. These contrast and Doppler techniques may be useful in detecting patients at risk for paradoxical emboli and in identifying candidates for closure of the PFO.\r"

Propofol in a dose of 1-3 mg.kg-1 was injected in an antecubital vein over 10-30 s. Successful induction was defined by loss of eyelash reflex occurring within 50 s of the conclusion of propofol injection and followed by subsequent acceptance of face mask without excessive movement. The effective dose of propofol resulting in loss of eyelash reflex in 50% (ED50) and 95% (ED95) of children were 1.3 (1.1-1.4) and 2.0 (1.7-2.6) mg.kg-1 (95% confidence interval). The corresponding ED50 and ED95 for a successful induction that included acceptance of face mask were 1.5 (1.3-1.7) and 2.3 (2.1-3.0), respectively. There was a 6.6% incidence of mild to moderate pain on injection and a 12.7% incidence of involuntary movement. Apnea (cessation of breathing greater than 20 s) was seen in 21% of patients. Blood pressure decreased by more than 20% of baseline value in 48% of patients who received halothane (1-3%) after the bolus injection of propofol. It is concluded that propofol is an effective induction agent in children. A dose of 2.5-3.0 mg.kg-1 is recommended to ensure a smooth transition to an inhalational maintenance technique. The use of antecubital veins is associated with a low incidence of pain on injection.\r"

We determined the clinical efficacy of a high- and a low-dose clonidine regimen on sedation, hemodynamic parameters, anesthesia, and analgesia. The low-dose clonidine group of patients (n = 14) received a 7-cm2 clonidine transdermal patch (Catapres-TTS #2), which was supplemented with oral doses of clonidine approximately 3 micrograms.kg-1 on the evening prior to surgery and on the morning of surgery. The high-dose clonidine group (n = 14) received a 10.5-cm2 clonidine transdermal patch (Catapres-TTS #3) with oral clonidine approximately 4.5 micrograms.kg-1 at bedtime and 6.0 micrograms.kg-1 on the morning of surgery. Placebo-treated (control) patients received the same occlusive patch without active ingredient and oral placebo tablets at bedtime and on the morning of surgery. Preanesthetic medication included midazolam 50 micrograms.kg-1 intramuscularly (im). Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil 30 micrograms.kg-1 intravenously (iv), thiopental 3 mg.kg-1 iv, and vecuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 iv, and was maintained with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and a continuous infusion of alfentanil 0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Isoflurane was added when the blood pressure exceeded 110% of the patient's prestudy value. For pain relief postoperatively, the patients received morphine, 1-2-mg iv boluses, via a patient-controlled analgesia pump. The low-dose clonidine patient group had mean plasma clonidine concentrations that varied from 1.47 ng.ml-1 (preoperative) to 1.32 ng.ml-1 (postoperative day 2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Central body temperature, which usually is well controlled, typically decreases more than 1 degree C during the 1st h of general anesthesia. This hypothermia has been attributed partially to an anesthetic-induced peripheral vasodilation, which increases cutaneous heat loss to the environment. Based on the specific heat of humans, heat loss would have to increase more than 70 W for 1 h (in a 70-kg person) to explain hypothermia after induction of general anesthesia. However, during epidural anesthesia, sympathetic blockade increases heat loss only slightly. Furthermore, thermoregulatory vasoconstriction in unanesthetized humans decreases heat loss to the environment only 15 W. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the hypothermia that follows induction of general anesthesia does not result from increased cutaneous heat loss. Heat loss and skin-surface and tympanic membrane temperatures, before and after induction of isoflurane anesthesia, were measured in five minimally clothed volunteers. Peripheral skin blood flow was evaluated with venous-occlusion volume plethysmography and skin-surface temperature gradients. Cutaneous heat losses in watts were summed from ten area-weighted thermal flux transducers. Tympanic membrane temperature, which was stable during the 30-min control period preceding induction, decreased 1.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C in the 50 min after induction. Isoflurane anesthesia decreased mean arterial blood pressure approximately 20%. Average skin-surface temperature increased over 15 min to 0.5 degree C above control. Heat loss from the trunk, head, arms, and legs decreased slightly, whereas loss from the hands and feet (10.5% of the body surface area) doubled (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We determined the peak plasma concentrations after intranasal administration of midazolam and compared this to plasma concentrations achieved after intravenously administered midazolam in 18 children between the ages of 14 months and 5 yr, who underwent elective closure of an asymptomatic atrial septal or ventricular septal defect. Preanesthetic medication was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Induction of anesthesia was with halothane in N2O and O2 via mask, and tracheal intubation was performed after the administration of fentanyl or sufentanil plus pancuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with these agents, and augmented with halothane or isoflurane. As soon as arterial access was established, the patient received 0.1 mg/kg of either intranasal or intravenous midazolam. Midazolam concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Intranasal midazolam achieved its peak plasma concentration of 72.2 +/- 27.3 ng/ml in 10.2 +/- 2 min. Ten minutes after the administration of midazolam, the mean plasma concentration in the intranasal midazolam group was 57% of the concentrations in the group receiving midazolam intravenously. These results confirm the clinical impression that intranasal administration of midazolam rapidly achieves sedative plasma concentrations in children.\r"

Oxygen uptake was measured continuously over the first 3 postoperative hours with a mass spectrometer system. Circulatory variables, esophageal temperature, and skin temperature were measured over the first 6 postoperative hours. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, rate pressure product, and norepinephrine concentration were decreased in the clonidine group (P less than 2 x 10(-4)). There were no differences among groups in the incidence of shivering and in the rate of increase of esophageal temperature. By contrast, oxygen uptake was lower in the clonidine group (P = 4 x 10(-4)). This contrasting pattern may be secondary to a reduction in the intensity of mean muscular tremor in the clonidine group.\r"

The most common complications in the OB claims were (percentage of all OB claims): maternal death (22%), newborn brain damage (20%), and headache (12%). In contrast, the most common complications in the nonobstetric (non-OB) group were (percentage of all non-OB claims): death (39%), nerve damage (16%), and brain damage (13%). The group of OB claims contained a proportionately greater number of minor injuries, such as headache, backache, pain during anesthesia, and emotional injury (32%) compared to the non-OB claims (4%). Complications due to aspiration and convulsions were more common among the OB cases. The standard of care was judged to have been met in 46% of OB and 39% of non-OB claims. This difference is not statistically significant. Claims involving general anesthesia were more frequently associated with severe injuries and resulted in higher payments than did claims involving regional anesthesia. Payments were made in a similar proportion of OB and non-OB claims (53 and 59%, respectively). For cases in which payments were made, the median payment for OB claims was significantly greater ($203,000) than for non-OB claims ($85,000; P less than or equal to 0.05).\r"

After subarachnoid administration of 3 ml 0.5% bupivacaine in 8% glucose, a deuterium-labeled analog (13.4 mg) was administered intravenously. Blood samples were collected for 24 h. Plasma concentrations of unlabeled and deuterium-labeled bupivacaine were determined with a combination of gas chromatography and mass fragmentography. Biexponential functions were fitted to the plasma concentration-time data of the deuterium-labeled bupivacaine. The systemic absorption was evaluated by means of deconvolution. Mono- and biexponential functions were fitted to the data of fraction absorbed versus time. The maximal height of analgesia and the duration of analgesia at T12 increased with age (r = 0.715, P less than 0.001; r = 0.640, P less than 0.01, respectively). In 18 patients the systemic absorption of bupivacaine was best described by a biexponential equation. The half-life of the slow systemic absorption process (r = -0.478; P less than 0.05) and the mean absorption time (r = -0.551; P less than 0.02) decreased with age.

After induction of anesthesia with sodium thiopental 3-5 mg.kg-1, a bolus of atracurium 0.2 mg.kg-1 was delivered by the controller; this was followed by an infusion calculated by the controller to maintain the electromyogram (EMG) at a setpoint of 90% neuromuscular blockade. The average overshoot for the controller was 10.1% and the mean steady-state error 3.0%. The mean infusion rates for atracurium to maintain 90% blockade were calculated for each anesthetic group, with the inhalation anesthetics at 1 MAC. Infusion rates for N2O/morphine, halothane 0.8%, enflurane 1.7%, and isoflurane 1.4% at 90% blockade were 5.7 +/- 0.6, 4.9 +/- 0.3, 3.5 +/- 0.3, and 4.1 +/- 0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, respectively (mean +/- SE).

The other infusion rates at 90% blockade have not been reported previously, but correspond to the known potencies of these inhalation anesthetics for augmentation of neuromuscular blockade. This controller performed well in comparison to previously developed controllers, and in addition was used as a research tool for rapid estimation of infusion rates.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients (7 men and 1 woman, 45-68 yr old) scheduled to undergo thoracotomy were given, preoperatively, 15 micrograms sufentanil in the lumbar intrathecal space for a study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma kinetics of sufentanil. Multiple samples of plasma and CSF from the lumbar region were obtained through indwelling catheters for 12 h and analyzed for sufentanil by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived by noncompartmental analysis. In plasma, the maximal concentration of sufentanil appeared after 0.65 +/- 0.17 h (mean +/- SEM). No equilibrium was reached between the sufentanil concentration in CSF and plasma, but the CSF/plasma concentration ratio declined from approximately 140 at 2 h to about 15 at 10 h. Extrapolation indicates that another 10 h would be required before the concentration in CSF would equal that in plasma. The mean residence time (MRT) of sufentanil in CSF was 0.92 +/- 0.08 h and in plasma was 6.8 +/- 0.6 h. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) in the subarachnoid compartment was 1.54 +/- 0.39 ml/kg, and the clearance from the CSF was 27 +/- 5 microliters.kg-1.min-1. The intrathecal administration of 15 micrograms sufentanil at the beginning of the operation did not produce analgesia that lasted into the postoperative period. Most patients had urinary retention, but none experienced any serious complications. This study demonstrates that the lipophilic opioid sufentanil undergoes rapid clearance from CSF and absorption to plasma after intrathecal administration. These pharmacokinetic characteristics are slower for the less lipophilic opioids meperidine and morphine. The rapid pharmacokinetics of sufentanil explain its rapid onset of action and short-lasting effects.\r"

  ".W": "In seeking a means to reverse local anesthetic block of peripheral nerve, we examined the actions of veratridine (VTD), an agent known to antagonize competitively the binding of local anesthetics to Na channels. The actions of VTD, a steroidal alkaloid \"activator\" of voltage-gated Na channels, were studied in the rabbit vagus nerve by two methods. In one, the effects of VTD on compound action potentials (APc) propagating through a \"veratrinized\" segment (11-mm) of nerve were measured by extracellular recording. Single volleys of impulses were unaffected by VTD, but trains of impulses, triggered by repetitive stimulation, were selectively diminished. This \"use-dependent\" reduction was greatest for the C-fiber component of the APc, less for B-fibers, and inconsequential for A-fibers. Use-dependent inhibition was enhanced by higher stimulation frequency and by increased VTD concentration, and reversed rapidly when stimulation ceased. If the nerve sheath remained intact, the rate of VTD action was far less than in desheathed nerves, but the effects were the same. In the other experimental system, membrane potentials were measured in the veratrinized region of the nerve by a sucrose-gap method. Repetitive stimulation, particularly of C-fibers, produced a cumulative VTD-induced depolarization (VID) that was sustained over several seconds and during which the C-fiber APc was selectively reduced. We propose that this local, use-dependent VID provides the means to inhibit impulses propagating through the veratrinized region. The preferential effect of VTD on C-fibers suggests its possibilities as a relatively selective agent for block of impulse trains in nociceptive afferents.\r"

Isometric twitch contractions were obtained at lengths ranging from the shortest length yielding the greatest active force development under isometric conditions (Lmax) to 86% of Lmax, in two consecutive protocols: first in [Ca2+]o ranging from 0.45 to 2.25 mM, and then in [Ca2+]o 2.25 mM before, during, and after exposure to incremental concentrations of halothane (n = 9 muscles), enflurane (n = 9 muscles), and isoflurane (n = 9 muscles), each in steps of 0.25 MAC to total concentrations up to and including 1.5 MAC. Each of the three anesthetics caused a concentration-dependent decrease in developed force. The relative extent of the negative inotropic effect was not different at various muscle lengths. Because myofibrillar Ca2+ responsiveness (Ca2(+)-affinity of troponin C) decreases at shorter muscle lengths, the results suggest that an alteration in myofibrillar Ca2+ responsiveness by volatile anesthetics is minor relative to the anesthetic-induced decreased intracellular Ca2+ availability in ventricular myocardium.\r"

To assess labetalol's actions in a setting of uterine vasoconstriction, saline or labetalol (1 mg/kg) was infused into maternal venous catheters in 12 pregnant ewes receiving continuous maternal intravenous infusions of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increased maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 120 +/- 4% of control and decreased uterine blood flow to 45 +/- 6% of control. Labetalol, but not saline, altered these parameters: it decreased MAP to 101 +/- 3% and increased uterine blood flow to 70 +/- 7% of prenorepinephrine values. In the second protocol, to assess the degree of labetalol-induced fetal adrenergic blockade, 7 pregnant ewes received, on separate days, saline or labetalol (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg) via a maternal venous catheter. Maternally administered labetalol produced minor (less than 12%) decreases in maternal and fetal MAP, without significantly altering heart rate (HR). At each labetalol dose, the degree of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, determined by phenylephrine and isoproterenol challenge, was greater in the ewe than in the fetus. In the near-term pregnant ewe, intravenous (iv) bolus administration of labetalol ameliorated the effects of increased circulating norepinephrine on maternal MAP, uterine blood flow, and fetal pH and arterial O2 tension (PaO2), and produced less adrenergic blockade in the fetus than in the mother.\r"

  ".W": "Seven dogs were chronically instrumented for measurements of mean aortic blood pressure and cardiac output and for simultaneous measurements of hepatic, portal, and renal blood flows. Each animal was studied on two separate occasions, awake and during 1.2, 1.4, 1.75, and 2.0 MAC isoflurane and enflurane. Both anesthetics induced tachycardia; to a greater degree than isoflurane, enflurane lowered mean aortic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner (-37, -45, -48, and -62% vs. -19, -25, -41, and -44%, respectively) and cardiac output (-20, -26, -41, and -48% vs. -3, -5, -11, and -15%, respectively). With isoflurane, cardiac output decreased only at 1.75 and 2.0 MAC, and portal blood flow did not change significantly, whereas hepatic arterial blood flow increased at 1.75 and 2 MAC (by 28 and 33%, respectively). With enflurane, no significant changes were recorded in hepatic arterial blood flow, whereas portal blood flow decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Except at 2 MAC, hepatic circulation did not differ between anesthetics. Likewise, neither anesthetic significantly changed renal blood flow, except for enflurane at 2.0 MAC, which was associated with a 35% reduction. Both anesthetics led to similar systemic, hepatic, and renal vasodilations. Our data suggest that high concentrations of enflurane are associated with decreases in portal, total hepatic, and renal blood flows, most likely as a result of an anesthetic-induced cardiac depression.\r"

  ".W": "The question as to whether reduction of plasma catecholamine concentration contributes to the beneficial effects of upper thoracic epidural anesthesia on survival during hemorrhagic shock was examined. Twenty-six dogs were anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide, and blood was withdrawn to reduce the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to 40 mmHg. The 12 dogs in group A received both upper thoracic epidural anesthesia before the hemorrhage and intravenous infusion of epinephrine (450 ng.kg-1.min-1) and norepinephrine (150 ng.kg-1.min-1) during hemorrhage. The 14 dogs in group B received none of these. At 20 min after the start of the bleeding, plasma catecholamine concentrations were increased in both groups more than ten-fold. There were no significant intergroup differences with respect to these concentrations at any point during the experimental period. During the 100-min period of hemorrhage, 1 of the 12 animals in group A and 10 of the 14 in group B died. A significant difference in survival was seen between the two groups over the 100-min hypotensive period (P less than 0.01 by the generalized Wilcoxon test). These results suggest that the survival benefit of upper thoracic epidural anesthesia cannot be explained simply by differences in the level of catecholamines in the plasma, and that perhaps differences in the level of catecholamines at the nerve endings or other factors may be more important.\r"

  ".W": "To provide new insights into the effects of volatile agents on the basic regulatory events involved in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and stimulus-secretion coupling, the well-characterized clonal rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was chosen as an experimental model. This cell line possesses nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, L-type voltage-operated channels (VOCs), and receptor-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCs). A PC12 variant, defective in nicotinic response, made it possible to study the influx-independent inositol trisphosphate-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release that is triggered by muscarinic receptor stimulation. [Ca2+]i was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. Dopamine and norepinephrine secretion were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. High K+ and nicotinic-receptor-induced [Ca2+]i increase and catecholamine secretion were inhibited by halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, and methoxyflurane in a dose-dependent manner; half-maximal inhibition (IC50) occurred within the clinically relevant concentration range. The inhibition was reversible after wash-out of anesthetic; was not restricted to dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type VOCs; and could not be overcome by increasing extracellular Ca2+. The inhibitory mechanisms of volatile anesthetics therefore differed from those of classical organic Ca2(+)-channel blockers, a difference also reflected by the differing Hill coefficients found for both substance groups. In contrast, the muscarinic-receptor-evoked internal Ca2+ release remained unimpaired, and secretion even increased under anesthetic exposure. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence that volatile anesthetics depress the Ca2+ influx through at least two independent Ca2+ channels, one of which proved insensitive to the dihydropyridine Ca2(+)-channel blocker nifedipine. This is particularly noteworthy, since dihydropyridine-insensitive N-type VOCs, so far found exclusively in neurons, are assumed to play a dominant role in synaptic transmission, which, although resistant to dihydropyridine inhibition, is effectively blocked by volatile anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "In dogs (n = 11) anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (to an isoelectric EEG), the authors investigated the influence of thoracic aortic cross-clamping (AXC) on systemic hemodynamics and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) with concurrent measurement of total brain flow (tCBF) and regional (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar) spinal cord blood flow (SCBF). The effect of phlebotomy (to control the hemodynamic consequences of AXC) on tCBF and SCBF was assessed. Radioactive microspheres were injected at four time periods in each animal: 1) at baseline; 2) with application of the AXC; 3) after phlebotomy, to reduce the proximal mean arterial pressure (MAPp) to baseline values; and 4) 2 min after removal of the AXC (mean AXC time 68 +/- 6 min). With application of the AXC, the MAPp, central venous pressure (CVP), and CSFP significantly increased (104 +/- 6 to 156 +/- 6 mmHg, 3.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.2 +/- 0.7 mmHg, and 3.3 +/- 0.7 to 5.2 +/- 0.8 mmHg, respectively), while distal mean aortic pressure (MAPd) significantly decreased (98 +/- 6 to 14 +/- 1 1 mmHg). Phlebotomy (24 +/- 3 ml.kg-1) significantly decreased MAPp (to 106 +/- 6 mmHg), CVP (to 1.6 +/- 0.6 mmHg), and CSFP (to 1.2 +/- 1.1 mmHg). The CSFP changed in parallel with the changes in CVP, a result suggesting that the alterations in CSFP depended on cardiac preload. The spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP; SCPP = MAPd - CSFP) was unchanged after phlebotomy, since both MAPd and CSFP decreased. The tCBF and cervical SCBF were unchanged when MAPp increased by 50% with application of the AXC; this indicated that autoregulation was intact.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Volatile anesthetics are potent bronchodilators, but the site of action for the dilation is unclear. To determine the site of action of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane on the peripheral vagal motor pathway, isolated strips of canine trachealis muscle were stimulated before and during exposure to halothane at 0.3, 1.0, 1.7, or 2.4 MAC, enflurane at 1 MAC, or isoflurane at 1 MAC. The sites and methods of stimulation were: 1) postsynaptic nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the intramural parasympathetic ganglia, with 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP); 2) postganglionic cholinergic nerve fibers, with electrical field stimulation (EFS); and 3) muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the smooth muscle, with acetylcholine (ACh). The concentration-response curve to DMPP was significantly shifted to the right by 0.3 MAC halothane, whereas 0.3 MAC halothane had no significant effect on the concentration-response curves to ACh and EFS. At concentrations greater than 1 MAC of halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane, concentration-response curves to all three stimuli were shifted significantly to the right; i.e., the contractile responses to ACh, EFS, and DMPP were reduced. At all concentrations of halothane the force of contraction was significantly more reduced during stimulation with DMPP than during stimulation with ACh, and at halothane concentrations greater than or equal to 1.7 MAC the response to EFS was significantly more reduced than that to ACh. We conclude that halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane attenuated airway constriction by several mechanisms, including 1) reduced excitability of the postsynaptic nicotinic receptors of the intramural parasympathetic ganglia and 2) an effect on the smooth muscle and/or on the muscarinic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Epinephrine causes an increase in myocardial and cerebral blood flow during CPR, but the influence on regional venous PCO2 and pH is as yet unknown. Fourteen pigs were allocated to receive either 0.9% saline (n = 7), or 45 micrograms/kg epinephrine (n = 7) after 5 min of ventricular fibrillation and 3 min of open-chest CPR. Blood samples were obtained during CPR from the aorta, pulmonary artery, great cardiac vein, and sagittal sinus before and 90 s and 5 min after drug administration. Regional blood flow was measured with tracer microspheres. Plasma catecholamines were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography in arterial blood. PCO2 90 s after drug administration in arterial, mixed venous, myocardial venous, and cerebral venous blood were (means +/- SD) 36 +/- 8, 67 +/- 9, 74 +/- 14, and 79 +/- 19 mmHg in the control group and 35 +/- 11, 62 +/- 12, 73 +/- 10, and 71 +/- 14 mmHg in the epinephrine group. pH values 90 s after drug administration in the same blood samples were 7.29 +/- 0.11, 7.11 +/- 0.09, 7.04 +/- 0.09, and 7.07 +/- 0.10 in the control group and 7.31 +/- 0.13, 7.17 +/- 0.07, 7.08 +/- 0.08, and 7.07 +/- 0.12 in the epinephrine group.

  ".W": "The effects of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel current (ICa) were compared in canine ventricular cells by the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. ICa was elicited in each cell by progressively depolarizing pulses, from -80 or -40 mV to more positive membrane potentials. The peak amplitude and inactivation rate of the inward current were analyzed before, during, and after the external application of equianesthetic concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 MAC) of halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane. The concentrations of these agents in the Krebs' solution were as follows (percentage in the gas phase): halothane 0.36, 0.68, and 1.50%; isoflurane 0.50, 1.00, and 1.90%; and enflurane 0.66, 1.36, and 2.39%. Halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane rapidly reduced peak ICa amplitude at all voltages studied, resulting in a depression of the entire current-voltage relationship for ICa activation. This depression was concentration-dependent and completely reversible upon wash-out of the anesthetic agents. Quantitatively, the three anesthetic agents produced a similar inhibition of peak ICa at approximately equianesthetic concentrations. Inactivation of ICa during 200-ms depolarizing pulses was not affected by two lower concentrations of the anesthetic agents, but was accelerated by the highest concentration of enflurane used. These findings suggest that the negative inotropic and chronotropic actions of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane on the ventricular myocardium are related, at least in part, to their inhibition of ICa at the sarcolemma. However, since all three anesthetic agents depressed ICa amplitude similarly, their quantitatively different effects on cardiac performance are due most likely to differences in actions at other cellular sites.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to determine the percent delivery by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) of a preparation of salbutamol (albuterol) to the distal end of either pediatric-size tracheal tubes or a narrow-gauge catheter. A bench model consisting of a swivel actuator; 3.0-6.0-mm ID tracheal tubes all 16 cm in length or a 19-G (standard wire gauge) catheter; mesh filters; and a continuous flow of dry air was used. Six actuations of salbutamol (100 micrograms each) were delivered during each experiment, and each experiment was repeated nine times. The delivery efficiency (DE) was the ratio of the net increase in weight of the filter, positioned at the distal end of the tracheal tube, to the net weight increase of the entire apparatus. We found that the DE (mean +/- SD) of salbutamol at the end of the tracheal tube was significantly less with a 3.0-mm ID tube (2.5 +/- 7.0%) than it was with a 4.0-mm (10.8 +/- 8.3%), 5.0-mm (10.7 +/- 7.2%), or 6.0-mm (12.3 +/- 8.4%) tube (P less than 0.05). To improve the DE of salbutamol aerosol, a 19-G catheter (0.7 mm ID) was inserted through the elbow connector and passed down the tracheal tube until the tip of the catheter approximated the distal tip of the tube. The DE of salbutamol in tracheal tubes (less than or equal to 12.3%) increased dramatically (97%; P less than 0.001) when a 19-G catheter was used. We conclude that the DE of salbutamol by MDI through 3.0-6.0-mm ID tracheal tubes is low but may be dramatically increased by actuating the canister into a 19-G distally placed catheter. Because of the increased efficiency of delivery, caution must be exercised when using a distally placed catheter to deliver MDI aerosols to patients.\r"

SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) scanning is a new technique designed to obviate this problem. SPECT scanning utilizes computer acquisition to provide three-dimensional scanning and the additional benefit of colorization to aid in discerning differences of uptake. SPECT scanning was performed on 22 patients with interstitial lung disease of various etiologies. Additionally, 7 patients had follow-up SPECT scanning to determine their response to treatment. Two patients are presented as examples.\r"

Regional myocardial ischemia and infarction were provided by means of ligature of the left coronary artery for 120 and 240 minutes respectively. Cardiac lymph was collected by conventional procedures. Enzymes released from the myocardium increased significantly in the cardiac lymph. The volume of cardiac lymph gradually increased after ligature of the coronary artery. Administration of hyaluronidase further increased the cardiac lymph flow and significantly decreased the I/R ratio as determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and methylene blue staining. Drainage of the cardiac lymph salvaged the ischemic myocardium. Reduction of interstitial edema and augmentation of cardiac lymph flow with the hyaluronidase prevented the development of the infarction. This is the first documentation of the effect of active drainage of cardiac lymph on the development of infarction through observation of the I/R ratio.\r"

The relationship between the calcification site and the significance in stenosis of each vessel was determined. Calcification was present in 133 arteries among 205 stenotic coronary arteries (sensitivity = 65%) as compared with 59 of 439 entire arteries with normal coronary angiograms (specificity = 87%). In the younger age group the sensitivity of calcification for stenosis of each coronary artery was lower and the specificity and predictive value were generally higher than those in the elderly group. These results demonstrate that CT is a valuable procedure for detecting coronary arterial disease, since this examination is easy to conduct, noninvasive, and widely applicable for screening a large population.\r"

All patients had signs and symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction. All had at least two major vessels obstructed as determined by coronary angiography. Pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily was administered for twelve weeks. Seven of 9 patients responded with increases in ejection fraction and exercise tolerance. Exercise tolerance correlated with improvement or lack of improvement in ejection fraction. For all patients at twelve weeks post-therapy mean ejection fraction increased 9.8% over baseline (p = .07), total treadmill time increased 15% (p = .27), and mean double product increased 13% (p = .03). Anginal symptoms were significantly improved over baseline at twelve weeks of therapy (p greater than .001), as well as dyspnea on exertion (p = .03). Pentoxifylline was well tolerated. Pentoxifylline may benefit ischemic cardiomyopathy by improving coronary perfusion owing to favorable alterations in hemorheologic properties.\r"

The microcirculation was studied in the subjects of both groups by microalbuminuria determination, retinal fluorangiography, and capillaroscopic examination of the bulbar conjunctive and nail folds. None of the patients presented microalbuminuria values higher than the upper limit of normal (20mg/24h). Fluoroangiographic alterations were observed in 4 patients, and all 10 presented capillaroscopic alterations at the bulbar conjunctiva (microaneurysms, erythrocyte aggregates) and nail folds (more frequently of the fingers than toes). Similar alterations were detected in controls. Thus these abnormalities seem independent of hemorheologic values.\r"

In order to determine whether HDL competitively blocks receptor-mediated low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding and uptake, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) containing 10% LDL-free fetal bovine serum, and incubated with 125I-LDL in concentrations of either 10 or 25 micrograms protein/mL. Varying amounts of HDL (0-200 micrograms/mL) were added to the media. Following a twenty-four hour incubation period at 37 degrees C, 125I-LDL binding and uptake were measured. At the lower concentration of 125I-LDL, which represents high-affinity receptor binding, there was no significant difference in either binding or uptake within the range of HDL concentrations studied. At the higher concentration of LDL, however, there was a marked inhibition of 125I-LDL binding (p less than .006) and uptake (p less than, 001; ANOVA), which did not saturate at the highest HDL concentrations used. These data suggest that HDL does not influence high-affinity, receptor-mediated binding and uptake of LDL but that its effect is seen at a concentration of LDL representing nonspecific binding. The lack of saturation at increasing concentrations of HDL also indicates that HDL-receptor interaction is not essential for the effect.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanisms of pulmonary gas-exchange impairment in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to evaluate their potential relationship to the CO diffusing capacity (DLCO), we studied 15 patients with IPF (mean DLCO, 52% of predicted) at rest (breathing room air and pure O2) and during exercise. We measured pulmonary hemodynamics and respiratory gas-exchange variables, and we separated the ventilation-perfusion (VAQ) mismatching and O2 diffusion limitation components of arterial hypoxemia using the multiple inert gas elimination technique. At rest VA/Q mismatching was moderate (2 to 4% of cardiac output perfusing poorly or unventilated lung units), and 19% of AaPO2 was due to O2 diffusion limitation. During exercise VA/Q mismatch did not worsen but the diffusion component of arterial hypoxemia increased markedly (40% AaPO2, p less than 0.005). We observed that those patients with higher pulmonary vascular tone (more release of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction) showed less pulmonary hypertension during exercise (p less than 0.05), less VA/Q mismatching [at rest (p less than 0.005) and during exercise (p less than 0.0025)], and higher arterial PO2 during exercise (p = 0.01). We also found that DLCO corrected for alveolar volume (KCO) correlated with the mechanisms of hypoxemia during exercise [VA/Q mismatching (p less than 0.025) and O2 diffusion limitation (p less than 0.05)] and with the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance elicited by exercise (p less than 0.005). In conclusion, we showed that the abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature are key to modulate gas exchange in IPF, especially during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA) have restrictive lung impairment, increased alveolar dead space, and hypoxemia. These factors, together with increased anaerobic metabolism, are thought to cause exercise hyperventilation. To assess the role of each of these in children, 34 patients with SCA and 16 control subjects performed pulmonary function and exercise tests. Twenty-eight patients with SCA had spirometric values and lung volumes, and all but two patients with SCA had arterial saturation greater than 91% during exercise. Despite a low VO2max (30.07 +/- 6.55 ml/min/kg), the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) in the patients occurred at a similar %VO2max as in the control subjects (69 +/- 9% versus 63 +/- 12%). The slope of the delta VE/delta VCO2 relationship for sub-VAT work was steeper in the patients (29.4 +/- 6.5 versus 24.7 +/- 5.2, p = 0.01), and the ventilatory equivalent for CO2 (VE/VCO2) in steady-state exercise was greater in the patients than in the control subjects (33.2 +/- 3.5 versus 30.8 +/- 3.5, p = 0.03). End-tidal PCO2 did not differ (38.3 +/- 3.0 versus 39.2 +/- 3.1), indicating equivalent alveolar ventilation. The patients had a higher dead space:tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) than did the control subjects (0.204 +/- 0.033 versus 0.173 +/- 0.024, p = 0.0005). The PaCO2 was significantly lower in those with lower Hb, but there was no difference in pH. In conclusion, children with SCA have an increased exercise ventilatory response caused in part by increased physiologic dead space, and in part by their low Hb. The greater dead space may be the result of sickle cells impairing capillary perfusion to ventilated alveoli.\r"

  ".W": "Desaturation in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) can lead to intravascular sickling and vascular occlusion. The increased metabolic demands of exercise tend to increase oxygen extraction, giving rise to a fall in saturation in the capillary bed that may predispose to sickling. This could be minimized with an increase in cardiac output. The aims of this study were to assess the role of increased stroke volume (SV) in augmenting cardiac output (Q) and to estimate the role of enlarged arteriovenous O2 content difference in maintaining O2 transport in children with SCA. A group of 30 children with SCA (Hb 65 to 133 g/L) and 16 healthy controls of the same racial group and of similar height and weight performed incremental and steady-state exercise at 50% Wmax. Cardiac output (Q) was measured by the indirect (CO2) Fick method during steady state. The slope of delta HR/delta VO2 during incremental exercise was higher in SCA subjects compared with controls (4.01 +/- 1.73 versus 2.80 +/- 0.61 bpm per ml/min/kg VO2, p = 0.001). Q for VO2 was abnormally high in patients, particularly older ones with lower Hb levels. HR (% predicted) was higher in patients than in controls (106 +/- 11 versus 92 +/- 8% predicted, p less than 0.0001), as was SV (113 +/- 16 versus 98 +/- 14% predicted, p = 0.002). Multiple linear regression of Q % predicted and SV % predicted on Hb and age showed a positive correlation with age and a negative correlation with Hb (r = 0.84 for Q and r = 0.76 for SV).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven fluid-restricted, furosemide-treated premature infants being mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who also had a significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) had pulmonary function testing performed before and after successful closure of the PDA. The diagnosis of a significant PDA was made by clinical and echocardiographic criteria. Indomethacin was administered at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg/dose every 12 to 18 h for 1 to 3 doses. To control for the 48-h time interval to achieve ductal closure, nine premature infants being ventilated for RDS but who did not have a significant PDA also had pulmonary function evaluations performed before and after the 48 h. Also, to control for the independent effect of fluid restriction and diuretic therapy on pulmonary compliance, eight such premature infants with a PDA had pulmonary function evaluations performed at a 48-h interval. Successful closure of the ductus with indomethacin was associated with an improvement in compliance and ventilation parameters in all infants in the indomethacin-treated infants. In the indomethacin-treated group, the mean percent improvements were noted in the following parameters: CLdyn, 59.2%; CLI, 78.3%; CLE, 63.3%; VT, 63.3%; VE, 54.6%. There were no significant changes in the pulmonary functions in the 48-h RDS or the 48-h PDA fluid-restricted, furosemide-treated control groups. In conclusion, successful closure of the ductus with indomethacin causes a significant improvement in compliance and ventilation parameters in infants being mechanically ventilated for RDS.\r"

Dependencies of Rrs and Ers on frequency and tidal volume were generally the same in each subject; Rrs tended to decrease with frequency and tidal volume, whereas Ers tended to increase with frequency and decrease with tidal volume. Multiple linear regression of combined data indicated that the frequency and tidal volume effects on Rrs and Ers were significant (p less than 0.05), and that the effects on Rrs decreased at higher flows. Average Rrs was highest (4.43 cm H2O/L/s +/- 0.21 SE) at 0.2 Hz-250 ml, and lowest (3.07 cm H2O/L/s +/- 0.37) at 0.6 Hz-750 ml. Average Ers was highest (12.1 cm H2O/L +/- 1.1) at 0.6 Hz-250 ml, and lowest (7.1 cm H2O/L +/- 0.6) at 0.2 Hz-750 ml. We conclude that frequency and tidal volume dependencies in Rrs and Ers in the normal range of breathing should be considered when interpreting measurements of respiratory system impedance or developing models to describe the mechanical behavior of the respiratory system.\r"

We compared the course of patients with PCP and respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit from 1986 to 1988 with a similar cohort hospitalized from 1981 to 1985. The hospital survival rate for the 35 patients in the 1986 to 1988 cohort was 40%, compared with 14% for the 42 patients in the 1981 to 1985 cohort (p less than 0.01). Age, episode of PCP, time since AIDS diagnosis, anti-PCP therapy, and important clinical variables were similar in both cohorts. Corticosteroids were used commonly in the recent era. Patients who received steroids had an in-hospital survival rate of 46%, compared with 22% for those who did not receive steroids (p = NS). In a stepwise logistic regression model, ICU care in the recent era and higher serum albumin at the time of ICU admission were the only variables significantly associated with survival. The hospital survival of patients with PCP and respiratory failure has improved. The improvement could not be explained by patient selection or by better anti-PCP therapy. The apparent beneficial effect of corticosteroids deserves further study. The improvement in ICU outcome was reflected in increased ICU utilization by patients with AIDS, PCP, and respiratory failure.\r"

  ".W": "An outbreak of tuberculosis at a shelter for homeless men was studied in detail to further the understanding of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in this setting. The shelter provides evening accommodations for men aged 50 yr and older. The capacity is approximately 200 clients, and the client pool is approximately 1,000 men/yr. During a 6-wk period in December 1986 and January 1987, seven cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed in shelter clients. Nine cases were reported in clients during the preceding 12 months, and four cases in the year previous to that. The majority of outbreak cases were pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum smear positive. Drug resistance was rare. Phage typing of 15 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates revealed one predominant type and four other types. The goals of the control plan (and the steps taken to achieve them) were to render known infectious cases noninfectious (directly observed therapy); to find undiagnosed infectious cases (repetitive mass screenings); to protect exposed clients (repetitive tuberculin skin testing and isoniazid preventive therapy); and to make the shelter environment safe (exclude infectious, noncompliant clients and improve the shelter's ventilation system). Implementation of this plan rapidly terminated the outbreak; following the first mass screening in January 1987, at which six asymptomatic cases were detected, only five additional cases occurred in shelter clients during a 2-yr period of follow-up. The investigation suggested that the outbreak evolved during 1986 as a result of the presence at the shelter of an increasing number of men with undiagnosed infectious pulmonary tuberculosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We assumed that the oxidation of methionine (met) to methionine sulfoxide [met(O)] by oxygen-derived free radicals released from phagocytes is one parameter to identify the oxidative mechanisms of lung injury. To test this hypothesis we determined the molar ratio of met(O)/met in the soluble protein fraction of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from healthy nonsmokers and from nonsmoking patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or sarcoidosis. The met(O)/met ratio of the healthy nonsmoker group (n = 11) was 0.046 +/- 0.008 (mean +/- SEM). In contrast, the met(O)/met ratio of the nonsmoking IPF group (n = 11) was significantly increased to 0.223 +/- 0.053 (p less than 0.0002). The BAL fluids of this group showed strongly increased numbers of neutrophils but normal numbers of alveolar macrophages (AM). In the sarcoidosis group (n = 10) the met(O)/met ratio (0.048 +/- 0.010) was not significantly different from control values. A close relationship was found between the met(O)/met ratios and the relative as well as the absolute neutrophil counts (r = 0.86; p less than 0.0002; n = 22). In contrast, no significant correlation was found between the met(O)/met ratios and the absolute AM counts (r = 0.22; p = 0.32; n = 22). We conclude that mechanisms of oxidative lung injury in IPF can be characterized by oxidation of met and that this oxidation may be mediated by neutrophils.\r"

Recently, an association has been made between the presence of serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and WG. Because WG frequently involves the lung, we sought to evaluate bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids obtained from 14 patients with WG for the presence of ANCA. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G ANCA was found in the BAL with the same staining patterns as observed in the serum. Patients with active disease had the highest serum and BAL IgG ANCA titers. IgA or IgM ANCA was not detected in the serum or BAL of these patients. Protein analysis of BAL fluid revealed that patients with active, untreated WG had approximately a fourfold elevation in total protein (41.3 versus 10.5 mg/dl), with a disproportionately greater increase in the ratio of IgG to albumin (BAL IgG index = 1.49, normal = 0.74; p = 0.027). The increase of the IgG index in patients with active WG suggests that local production of IgG ANCA occurs in the lungs.\r"

Recent studies have shown a relationship between emphysema and high levels of EDP in human plasma. This report characterizes elastin digests on the basis of antigenicity, size, and method of preparation, as well as the size distribution of EDP found in the plasmas of nonsmokers, smokers, and emphysema patients. Gel filtration of elastin digests prepared by hydrolysis of human lung elastin using a low (1:500) ratio of neutrophil elastase to elastin generated a broad protein peak of approximately 70,000 daltons. In contrast, a high (1:25) ratio of neutrophil elastase to human lung elastin gave a broad protein peak, with a size distribution in the 10,000 to 30,000 dalton range. This digest showed distinct immunochemical properties. A polyclonal antibody directed against the low-ratio digest showed a minimum detection of 2 ng/ml for the homologous antigen but required 1,000 ng/ml of the high-ratio digest for detectable inhibition in an indirect ELISA assay. Gel filtration of plasmas from normal nonsmokers and the majority of normal smokers revealed a single immunoreactive EDP fraction of approximately 70,000 daltons. Plasmas from selected normal smokers and emphysema patients with high levels of circulating EDP (greater than 90 ng/ml) fractionated into a complex pattern of peptides in which the 70,000 dalton component represented 50% of the immunoreactive material and several lower molecular weight peptides represented the remaining circulating elastin antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute lung injury was assessed by measurements of lung water (lung wet/dry weight ratio; W/D ratio), the concentration ratio of 125I-albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue compared with plasma (albumin index; BAL-AI or tissue-AI), and total differential leukocyte count in BAL fluid. Mean arterial pressure (Pa) and peripheral WBC counts were monitored continuously over the 8-h experiment. Septicemia was induced by a bolus injection of 2 x 10(9)/kg live E. coli. Thirty minutes later the animals received a bolus injection followed by continuous infusion of PTXF (20 mg/kg + 20 mg/kg/h; n = 8) or db-cAMP (2 mg/kg + 2 mg/kg/h; n = 8) or saline (septic control; n = 8). Nonseptic control groups were also studied. The lung W/D ratio, BAL-AI, lung tissue-AI, and BAL leukocyte count increased significantly in the septic control group. The PTXF-septic and db-cAMP-septic groups showed no significant increase in lung W/D ratio, BAL-AI, and lung tissue-AI. However, there was no difference in BAL total and differential leukocyte count as compared with the septic control group. PTXF and db-cAMP had no effect on E. coli-induced changes in peripheral WBC count and Pa. Comparison in vitro experiments demonstrated that PTXF and db-cAMP inhibited the endotoxin-induced (E. coli) chemiluminescent response of isolated guinea-pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In anesthetized and ventilated guinea pigs intravenous injection of ET-1, ET-2, or ET-3 (1 or 2 nmol/kg) induced similar dose-dependent increases in pulmonary inflation pressure (PIP) associated with increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MBP). Pretreatment of the guinea pigs with 1 mg/kg intravenous indomethacin significantly inhibited the increase in PIP evoked by 2 nmol/kg of ET-1, ET-2, or ET-3. In contrast, the increase in MBP following injection of the various ET isotypes was not significantly affected by indomethacin. Injection of ET-1, ET-2, or ET-3 (40, 120, and 400 pmol) via the pulmonary artery of isolated and perfused guinea pig lungs induced dose-dependent increases in PIP and pulmonary perfusion pressure (PPP), thromboxane B2 (TXB2) release, and formation of lung edema. In keeping with the in vivo results, no marked differences were observed between the activities of ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 on isolated and perfused guinea pig lungs. Indomethacin (5 microM) added to the perfusion medium significantly inhibited the alterations of PIP and PPP, TXB2 release, and edema formation evoked by 400 pmol ET-1, ET-2, or ET-3. High-affinity binding sites for ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 exhibiting similar characteristics were identified on guinea pig lung membrane. Therefore ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 exert comparable bronchopulmonary and pressor activities in the guinea pig and probably act via interaction with the same binding site. In addition, the ET-induced increase in PIP and pulmonary vasoconstriction are primarily mediated via the production of cyclooxygenase metabolites.\r"

There were 35 nonsmoking female and 31 smoking male textile workers restudied from the original group of 116. The majority of those lost to follow-up had left the industry. The prevalence of byssinosis among the female workers at the time of follow-up was 15/35 (42.9%) compared with 8/35 (22.9%) at the time of the initial study (p = 0.063). For men the byssinosis prevalence at follow-up was 16/31 (51.6%) compared with 8/31 (22.9%) at the time of the initial study (p = 0.03). Similarly, the prevalence of almost all other respiratory symptoms was significantly higher at the follow-up than at the time of the initial study. Significant across-shift decrements in FEV1 and FVC were documented at both surveys. The mean annual decline in ventilatory capacity was greater than expected for both female (FVC: -0.036 +/- 0.005 L/yr; FEV1: -0.059 +/- 0.009 L/yr) and male workers (FVC: -0.059 +/- 0.008 L/yr; FEV1: -0.068 +/- 0.006 L/yr) (Mean +/- SE). The mean total airborne dust concentration measured at the time of the follow-up study was 3.95 mg/m3 with an average respirable dust concentration of 0.97 mg/m3. We conclude that continued exposure to high dust concentrations in the cotton textile industry is associated with an increasing prevalence of respiratory symptoms and progressive impairment of lung function. The increase in respiratory impairment was seen both in smokers and nonsmokers.\r"

After adjustment for intensity and duration of smoking and for depth of inhalation, the risk of chronic phlegm, cough, and dyspnea were not related to the tar and nicotine yields. In 414 subjects with pulmonary function tested in at least one of the three surveys the spirometric indices used were significantly related to the daily dose of tar, nicotine, and CO (product of the cigarette yield and daily number of cigarettes smoked). The effects were more pronounced for past than for current doses. However, the differentiation of pulmonary function due to various yields of cigarettes was small in comparison to the difference in pulmonary function between smokers and nonsmokers.\r"

We conclude that diminished initial airway function may be a predisposing factor for recurrent wheezing respiratory illnesses starting in the first year of life. Infants who will have only one wheezing respiratory illness or who will start wheezing after the first year of life seem to have lower levels for some but not for all lung function tests performed in this study.\r"

Altogether, 20 and 6% of the sample had PC20 less than or equal to 32 mg/ml and PC20 less than or equal to 8 mg/ml, respectively. The relationship of bronchial responsiveness to the following potential predictors were examined: sex, age, smoking habits, airway caliber (FEV1), FEV1 percent predicted (%FEV1), urban-rural area of residence, occupational airborne exposure in present job, and total serum IgE. After adjusting for age and FEV1, the odds ratio for PC20 less than or equal to 32 mg/ml was higher for men than for women in smokers and in ex-smokers, but did not vary by sex in nonsmokers, the adjusted odds ratio for PC20 less than or equal to 32 mg/ml in male compared with female smokers being 8.4 (95% Cl: 2.5-37.4). Irrespective of smoking status the sex- and FEV1-adjusted odds ratio for PC20 less than or equal to 32 mg/ml fell with increasing age. For every 10-yr increase in age the adjusted odds ratio for PC20 less than or equal to 32 mg/ml methacholine in nonsmokers decreased by 2.0 (95% Cl: 1.3-3.3). Also FEV1 and %FEV1 were predictors of PC20 less than or equal to 32 mg/ml after adjusting for sex and age irrespective of smoking status. Bronchial responsiveness (PC20 less than or equal to 8 mg/ml) was more prevalent in rural than in urban areas, the adjusted odds ratio being 2.5 (95% Cl: 1.1-5.9) for bronchial responsiveness in rural compared with urban residents after adjusting for sex, age, smoking habits, and FEV1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This report describes the pattern of diurnal changes in PEFR in a reference population, and defines ranges of \"normal\" between- and within-day variability. An index of diurnal changes was defined as the ratio between maximal and minimal values, where the maximal value was restricted to PEFR measured at noon or in the evening (N, E) and the minimal value was restricted to the morning or at bedtime (M, B). A ratio greater than normal represented an exaggeration of the normal diurnal pattern in PEFR. Normal limits, based on the ninety-fifth percentile in the reference population, were larger for children (130%) than for adults 15 to 35 yr of age (117%) and those older than 35 yr of age (118%). The meaningfulness of excessive diurnal changes in PEFR was examined by relating this ratio (Max/Min), and a similar measure (the amplitude percent mean) to chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases in 938 adults and children who recorded PEFR values 2 to 4 times per day for as long as 14 days. There was a strong relationship of diurnal changes in PEFR that exceed normal limits with physician-confirmed asthma (relative risk of 2.99 with Max/Min), with exertional dyspnea (Grade 2+), and with more frequent reporting of acute symptoms of wheeze, attacks of wheezing dyspnea, cough, and chest colds. In addition, those exceeding the normal limits had about 2.9 times greater risk of having a FEV1 below 80% of predicted, and nearly 7 times greater risk of being below 70%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A group of 14 stable asthmatic individuals (beta 2-agonists only as needed) had inhalation provocation tests with allergen (18 tests in total) and with diluent. Serial blood samples were taken before and 1 and 24 h after the tests; methylcellulose cultures for Eo/B-CFU and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CFU) were scored at 14 days. Circulating Eo, B, and Eo/B-CFU were increased at 24 h after allergen inhalation when this resulted in increased histamine airway responsiveness (n = 13). In the 5 subjects with isolated early asthmatic responses the Eo, B, and Eo/B-CFU counts did not change. There was no change in the GM-CFU after allergen. The ratio change in circulating Eo/B-CFU was negatively correlated with baseline histamine airway responsiveness (r = -0.8, p less than 0.05). Four subjects who had an isolated early response and no blood changes to one allergen developed an increase in histamine airway responsiveness and an increase in Eo, B, and Eo/B progenitors after inhalation of a second different allergen. The results indicate that in subjects with an allergen-induced increase in histamine airway responsiveness, an inflammatory response occurs that includes an increase in the number of Eo/B progenitors. This response, possibly mediated by Eo/B growth and differentiation factors, could lead to the accumulation of these cells in the airway and contribute to the airways inflammation present in asthma.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize asthma in the elderly, 25 consecutive nonsmoking pulmonary clinic patients over the age of 70 who met the American Thoracic Society criteria for asthma were identified. Of these, 12 patients (48%) had developed asthma at an advanced age (greater than 65 yr). This group with late-onset asthma had a mean duration of disease of 5.1 +/- 2.5 yr. The remaining group with early-onset asthma had a mean duration of illness of 31.4 +/- 14.6 yr. On the day of evaluation each patient underwent pulmonary function testing off all medication for at least 12 h. These two groups were indistinguishable by symptoms and medication requirements. Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing to 43 aeroallergens was uniformly negative in all 25 patients but the histamine control was always positive. IgE levels in both groups were not different from those in elderly control subjects. Those with early-onset asthma had a greater likelihood of previous allergic disease (p less than 0.001) and a significantly greater degree of airflow obstruction in pre- and postbronchodilator pulmonary function testing (p less than 0.05). This study suggests that long-standing asthma may lead to chronic persistent airflow obstruction and thereby mimic chronic bronchitis and emphysema (COPD).\r"

  ".W": "Although it is recognized that inhalation of acid aerosols by subjects with asthma can cause bronchoconstriction, the effects of the inhalation of an alkaline aerosol are unknown. When supplemental inflatable restraints (automobile air bags) are deployed an alkaline aerosol is released. This aerosol is composed of particles of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate with some sodium hydroxide. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol is approximately 1 micron, and the pH of the aerosol is 9.8 to 10.3. A group of 14 volunteer male subjects with mild asthma inhaled increasing concentrations of this aerosol for 20-min periods of mouth-only tidal ventilation. Pulmonary function tests were performed at baseline (preexposure), after inhalation of room air alone (control), and after each period of inhalation of the aerosol. A total of 5 subjects inhaled aerosols at nominal concentrations of 10, 20, and 40 mg/m3, whereas 11 subjects inhaled aerosols concentrations of approximately 30, 60, and 120 mg/m3. The mean changes in FEV1 and specific airways resistance (SRaw) for the 11 subjects who inhaled the higher concentrations (average highest concentration 126.6 +/- 7.5 mg/m3, mean +/- SEM) were -1.4 +/- 1.9 and +17.5 +/- 8.5%, respectively. Neither change in lung function was clinically or statistically significant. We conclude that the inhalation of relatively high concentrations of this alkaline aerosol by subjects with mild asthma does not result in bronchoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "Disorders of the upper respiratory tract, particularly allergic rhinitis are commonly associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The latter may be responsible for chronic cough, a common symptom in patients with allergic rhinitis, which, as previously shown, can be the sole presenting manifestation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Theophylline is widely used in patients with asthma for its bronchodilator effect, whereas its action on bronchial reactivity is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of theophylline administration on bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with allergic rhinitis complaining of chronic cough. Fourteen patients were studied. All of them were judged atopic on the basis of positive skin tests to common allergens. During control, spirometry, flow-volume curves and specific airway conductance (SGaw) were measured. Bronchial challenges were then performed with increasing concentrations of carbachol, and dose-response curves were constructed. The concentration of carbachol, which decreased SGaw by 35% from baseline (PD35) was determined by interpolating from the dose-response curve. After control measurements patients received in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion either theophylline 10 mg/kg/day orally or placebo for 30 days. Measurements were then redone. After a washout period of 8 days the measurements were repeated, and patients received theophylline or placebo for a second period of 30 days. Measurements were again performed at the end of this last study period. During control all patients had normal baseline lung function data and showed marked bronchial hyperresponsiveness, PD35 amounting to 26 +/- 7 micrograms of carbachol (normal value greater than 160 micrograms). No significant changes in PD35 were noted after placebo and washout when compared with control values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nocturnal asthma is a frequent problem, but the mechanism is unclear. We investigated the possibility that airways inflammation occurred during the night. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed in asthmatic patients with (n = 7) and without nocturnal asthma (n = 7) at 1600 and 0400 h. The nocturnal asthma group had an increase in the total leukocyte count (24.0 +/- 7.0 to 41.1 +/- 9.9 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05), neutrophils (1.1 +/- 0.6 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05), and eosinophils (0.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05) from 1600 to 0400 h. Cellular components for the non-nocturnal asthma group did not change. Between groups, the 1600-h cells were similar. At 0400 h the nocturnal asthma group had significantly higher total leukocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell counts. For all subjects, the overnight fall in peak expiratory flow rates was correlated to the change in neutrophils (r = 0.54, p less than 0.05) and eosinophils (r = 0.77, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the nocturnal worsening of asthma has an associated cellular inflammatory response that is not seen in patients without overnight decrements in lung function. This inflammatory response together with epithelial damage may be important factors in the etiology of nocturnal asthma.\r"

Six subjects received live, attenuated influenza virus by nasal drops and by aerosol. Although infection occurred in these six subjects, with the development of 4-fold or greater increases in hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers, they remained asymptomatic. Eight subjects received placebo via the same route, and did not develop symptoms and showed no increase in antibody titer. Prior to administration of virus or placebo, histamine diphosphate aerosol increased airway resistance only slightly, and there was no difference between the virus and placebo groups. Two days after inoculation, bronchomotor responses in the placebo group were unchanged (p greater than 0.05), but in the virus-infected group, bronchomotor responses were significantly greater than in the preinfected state (p less than 0.01). Isoproterenol hydrochloride reversed and prevented the increase in airway resistance after histamine, suggesting that the bronchoconstriction was caused by smooth muscle contraction. Our findings indicate that transient, asymptomatic respiratory virus infection augments airway smooth muscle responses.\r"

Fourteen nonsmoking patients with asthma who were in a stable period of their disease and eight nonsmoking healthy volunteers were studied. The ratios of the concentrations of albumin, ceruloplasmin (CP), and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) between blood and epithelial lining fluid were calculated (cQalb, cQCP, and cQA2M). The cQalb was increased in the patients (Mann-Whitney U test, p less than 0.05). In 10 patients the bronchial hyperreactivity was assessed with histamine provocation tests. Significant relationships between the cQalb, cQCP, and cQA2M on the one hand and PC15 on the other hand were found (Spearman's rank correlation: r = -0.62, p less than 0.05; r = -0.61, p less than 0.05; r = -0.79, p less than 0.01, respectively). Fourteen patients were treated with two inhalations of 200 micrograms glucocorticosteroids per day in a 3-month prospective study. Three of them were excluded from further study because of an intercurrent exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms during therapy. In the 11 patients with stable asthma, the cQalb and cQA2M decreased after treatment with inhaled steroids (Wilcoxon's matched pairs signed rank test, p less than 0.03). Our results show that in patients with stable asthma, there is an increased plasma exudation into the airways, most likely caused by an increased respiratory membrane permeability. The plasma exudation correlated with the bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine, and it decreased after corticosteroid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of cooling on the responses of isolated human airways to the beta-agonist isoproterenol, the alpha/beta-agonist norepinephrine in the presence of the beta-blocker timolol, methacholine, leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and histamine. In addition, the effect of cooling on baseline airway tone and responses to electric field stimulation (EFS) was studied. At 27 degrees C the sensitivity (-logEC50) and maximal response to isoproterenol were unchanged. No measurable response was found to alpha-adrenergic stimulation with norepinephrine + timolol either before or during cooling. At 27 degrees C and 21 degrees C the sensitivity and maximal contraction to methacholine and LTC4 as well as the contraction to a single dose of histamine were reduced. Cooling diminished baseline airway tone. EFS produced a rapid cholinergic contraction followed by a deflection below baseline and a sustained noncholinergic contractile response, which was substantially reduced by the LTC4/D4 receptor antagonist FPL 55712 (11.5 microM) at all three temperatures. Cooling decreased the cholinergic response to EFS and increased the sensitivity to EFS-induced relaxation. In contrast, the sustained noncholinergic contractile response to EFS was not changed, suggesting that cooling facilitates the synthesis of LTC4/D4 that follows EFS and/or inhibits its inactivation. We conclude that in nonasthmatic, isolated human airways slow cooling of the airway wall down to 21 degrees C does not cause bronchoconstriction and does not increase the responsiveness to contractile or relaxing agonists. However, cooling increases the sensitivity to EFS-induced relaxation and might facilitate the accumulation of leukotriene C4/D4 in the airway wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lung lavage was performed, the animals were exsanguinated, and the lungs were fixed in 10% formalin. Histologic edema and the extent of infiltration of the bronchi, pulmonary veins, and arteries by cells was scored blindly. IL-2 increased airway responsiveness to MCh; the concentrations of MCh causing a doubling of RL were 0.14 versus 1.39 mg/ml (geometric mean) for the IL-2 and vehicle group, respectively (p = 0.001). IL-2 significantly increased total cellular return and the percentage of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils in lavage. IL-2 caused edema and a mixed cellular infiltration of the bronchovascular tree. Lymphocytes predominated around the airways and veins. A correlation (r = 0.50) was present between airway responsiveness and airway inflammation but not with edema or vascular infiltration. Release of IL-2 by lymphocytes in the airways may be an important mediator of airway hyperresponsiveness.\r"

We then studied three groups of animals to determine if complement depletion with cobra venom factor (CVF) prior to ischemia and reperfusion would prevent the injury. Rabbits treated with CVF but without occlusion and reperfusion did not develop significant lung edema, with left and right lung wet/dry ratios of 5.32 +/- 0.11 and 5.26 +/- 0.12, respectively. For rabbits that were not treated with CVF but underwent ischemia and reperfusion, the comparable numbers were 6.15 +/- 0.36 and 5.19 +/- 0.32 (p less than 0.05 for right versus left). For CVF-treated rabbits that underwent ischemia and reperfusion, the right/left difference persisted (6.77 +/- 0.48 versus 5.35 +/- 0.14, p less than 0.01). Immunocytochemistry documented C3 deposition in non-CVF rabbits that underwent ischemia and reperfusion but not in CVF-treated rabbits. We conclude that ischemia/reperfusion of the lung results in complement activation, but it is not a complement-dependent injury.\r"

One lung was obtained at autopsy from each of eight patients with BPD (ages, 2 to 28 months) and six children (ages, 5 days to 51 months) who died without lung disease. Patients with BPD demonstrated severe somatic growth retardation and had reduced lung volumes with abnormal lobar volume proportions. In the central bronchi mean volume proportion of glands and smooth muscle was increased in BPD. Bronchiolar density was also increased, but it tended to normalize with advancing age. Mean bronchiolar diameter was slightly smaller in BPD, and bronchiolar smooth muscle hypertrophy was a constant histologic feature. The most striking change, however, was noted in alveolar structure and development. Total alveolar number was severely decreased in patients with BPD compared with that in control subjects, and there was little evidence of compensatory alveolar development with increasing age. Lung internal surface area was correspondingly reduced, and mean linear intercept was increased. Sections stained for elastic tissue demonstrated in the patients with BPD a simplified acinar structure with thickened, tortuous, and irregularly distributed alveolar elastic fibers. We conclude that in severe, fatal BPD there is marked impairment of lung development with alveolar hypoplasia and reduced internal surface area. In addition, bronchial and bronchiolar smooth muscle hypertrophy and bronchial gland hyperplasia may be important contributing factors to airflow limitation.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in 13 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), 20 disease control subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and 24 normal control subjects was conducted to (1) evaluate the quality of the alveolar inflammatory response associated with active WG; (2) determine whether antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) is present in alveolar fluid and produced in the lungs of patients with WG; and (3) determine whether inhaled particles or infectious agents may play an etiologic role in WG. BAL in untreated active WG had a marked increase in neutrophils (mean = 42% of total WBC count), and usually in eosinophils (mean = 4%) compared with that in normal control subjects (1.6% neutrophils, 0% eosinophils), and untreated WG in remission (5.9% neutrophils, 0% eosinophils). Disease control subjects with IPF, a process known to be associated with neutrophilic alveolitis, had an increased population of neutrophils (15.4%) and eosinophils (2.7%) in BAL. Leukocyte remnants, as well as intact leukocytes, could be identified within BAL macrophages in the patients with WG and IPF, and rarely in the normal control subjects. Normal subjects and control patients with IPF were all negative for ANCA in serum, whereas ANCA was found in serum and BAL in all patients with active WG who had generalized disease. Protein analysis of BAL revealed a disproportionate increase in the IgG to albumin ration compared with serum values (IgG index) in patients with active untreated disease. The increase in the IgG index suggests that IgG with ANCA reactivity is produced by pulmonary lymphoid tissue. An infectious agent in BAL was not identified by any of the techniques applied in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Asbestosis is an inflammatory and fibrotic process of the alveolar structures mediated, at least in part, by cytokines released by \"activated\" alveolar macrophages. The process of phagocytosis and \"activation\" of alveolar macrophages is poorly understood. Are all macrophages activated or only subpopulations? Which cytokines are up-regulated? How does the local milieu modulate profibrotic and antifibrotic mediators? Is protein release accompanied by up-regulation of gene transcription? Is there an ordered sequence of cytokine activity? What roles do neutrophils and lymphocytes play? How can disease progression best be quantified absent further exposure? Answers to these questions are important to direct rational strategies at interdicting the fibrotic process. The question of cancer and asbestos is more vexing. The processes of inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis appear to be closely intertwined. For example, proto-oncogenes such as c-sis (PDGF B-chain) are up-regulated in activated alveolar macrophages from fibrotic lungs; these and possibly others may play an important role in asbestos carcinogenesis. Second, asbestos can transfect DNA into cells. Furthermore, DNA can adhere to asbestos fibers, and these fibers are capable of direct transmigration into cells. The questions of the mechanisms of cigarette smoke cocarcinogenicity and latency remain. Lastly, if the bronchial epithelium is highly metaplastic throughout from cigarette smoking, what triggers a single (or several) nidus of cells to transform into carcinoma? Malignant mesothelioma poses the most challenging questions because of association with brief asbestos exposure by history. Mesothelial cells are susceptible to minute environmental manipulations, and changes occur after exposure to all fiber types. Yet epidemiologic studies point toward long amphiboles as having greater mesothelioma risk. To test this hypothesis, experimental data must be generated differentiating tumorigenesis risk from short, chrysotile fibers that can migrate to the parietal pleura from the associations of long amphiboles persisting in lung tissue. Despite the future decreasing numbers of clinical cases of asbestos-related disease, solving the important mechanistic questions remaining will contribute significantly to our understanding of fibrosis and cancer.\r"

Patients with solid tumors represent a very small fraction of the reported cases of PCP. Over an 18-month period, PCP was diagnosed in three patients who had received radiation and chemotherapy for breast cancer. In all three patients, there was no serologic or clinical evidence of AIDS. Direct staining of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) revealed Pneumocystis carinii, and cellular analysis of BAL revealed an increased percentage of lymphocytes with reversed helper/inducer:suppressor/cytotoxic T-cell (CD4:CD8) ratio. Because decreased CD4:CD8 ratio in BAL is commonly accepted as findings consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and AIDS, we conclude that similar findings in patients without AIDS are not specific for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and P. carinii should be ruled out in the appropriate clinical setting.\r"

In contrast to trachea, contractile responses in asthmatic bronchi to acetylcholine, histamine, and cholinergic nerve stimulation were similar to those in control bronchi. The potency of isoprenaline (IC50) was reduced 9.4-fold (p less than 0.003), similar to trachea (4.5-fold), whereas theophylline responses were normal.

The drugs were administered from metered-dose inhalers at 15-min intervals for five doses (total dose, 10 puffs of each compound). Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, total electromechanical systole (as a measure of inotropic response), QTc interval, plasma potassium, and FEV1 were made 5 min after each dose and 30 min after the final dose. Fenoterol and metaproterenol had significantly greater inotropic, electrocardiographic, chronotropic, and hypokalemic effects than did both isoproterenol and epinephrine. There was no difference in the bronchodilating effect of metaproterenol, fenoterol, or isoproterenol although these agents caused a significantly greater increase in FEV1 than did epinephrine. The concept of increasing beta-2 selectivity for metaproterenol and fenoterol compared with isoproterenol are not supported in the clinical setting.\r"

Seven of the nine patients had increased mast cells in the marrow biopsy specimens, and five patients had focal aggregates of mast cells. The bone scan was abnormal in one patient. Liver-spleen scans revealed a shift of colloid uptake from liver to spleen in four patients. No abnormal gastrointestinal tract roentgenograms were obtained. Urinary histamine metabolites correlated with nodular bone marrow involvement, but not with other parameters. Results of the psychoneurologic testing revealed significant deviation from the norm with a verbal memory deficit in all nine patients and abnormalities on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory in four patients. All nine patients were treated with 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate ointment under occlusion over half of the body nightly for 6 weeks. Seven of nine patients treated responded with almost complete resolution of their lesions. Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis suppression was evaluated with intramuscular cosyntropin stimulation and metyrapone administration during treatment. Only two patients, both of whom used the medication improperly, developed transient abnormalities. Slow return of lesions was noted 6 months after completion of therapy. Remissions could be lengthened with single weekly applications of topical steroids. Systemic involvement is frequent in patients with cutaneous mast cell disease and it is best demonstrated by bone marrow biopsy. Mast cell lesions can be safely and effectively treated with topical steroids in motivated patients.\r"

  ".W": "Strawberry, or capillary, hemangiomas are common vascular neoplasms, with an incidence of approximately 2.6% in neonates. They usually develop in the first few weeks of life, so that between 1 month and 1 year the incidence rises to between 8.7% and 10.1%. These lesions may grow quite large in the first year of life, and they may ulcerate or obstruct a vital organ or function. The great majority will spontaneously regress after the first year of life. Parents are often alarmed at the sight of these hemangiomas and need reassurance that the great majority will regress spontaneously. Treatments such as cryosurgery, irradiation, radium instillation, corticosteroid therapy, or surgical excision are often ineffective or cause significant morbidity. We describe 10 children with capillary hemangiomas treated with the flash lamp-pumped pulsed dye laser. The patients ranged in age from 7 weeks to 5.5 years at the beginning of laser therapy. The patients underwent 3.1 +/- 1 (mean +/- SD) laser treatments, with a mean regression of the lesions of 69.9% +/- 4.5%. All patients demonstrated some diminution in the size and color of their hemangiomas after the treatments, and there were no ill effects, such as ulceration, hemorrhage, infection, or scarring. There was no evidence of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. Pulsed dye laser therapy should be considered as an option in the treatment of capillary hemangiomas, preferably prior to their full evolution. It is also a useful therapeutic approach in those hemangiomas that are slow to regress in older children.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 13 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and a chronic pruritic folliculitis that was unresponsive to systemic treatment with bactericidal anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. The skin eruption was characterized by multiple urticarial follicular papules scattered on the trunk (100%), the head and neck (85%), and the proximal aspect of the extremities (62%). Absolute peripheral eosinophil counts were increased in six of 13 patients; a relative peripheral eosinophilia was present in 10 of 13 patients. Serum IgE levels were elevated in all seven patients tested (range, 88 to 9050 IU). Histopathologic features included a folliculitis with eosinophils. Pathogenic bacteria were not consistently found by routine bacterial skin cultures, cultures of skin biopsy specimens, or histopathologic evaluation. CD4 counts were decreased in all of the 12 patients tested (less than 300 cells per cubic millimeter) and were below 250 cells per cubic millimeter in 10 patients. A clinical response was noted to astemizole, to ultraviolet light in the B range, and to topical clobetasol propionate. These observations demonstrate that HIV-associated eosinophilic folliculitis is a unique HIV-related cutaneous disorder that is characterized by a culture-negative, chronic, pruritic folliculitis and a characteristic histopathologic picture. Of special importance, because it is associated with CD4 counts of less than 250 to 300 cells per cubic millimeter, eosinophilic folliculitis appears to be an important clinical marker of HIV infection and, particularly, of patients at increased risk of developing opportunistic infections. We suggest that the term eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (Ofuji's disease), previously used to describe this dermatosis in HIV-infected patients, should be discarded.\r"

The mean age was 12.2 +/- 1.4 years, with a range of 9 to 15 years. Pubertal maturation was scored as Tanner pubic hair stages (PH I to V) and pubertal stages (PS I to IV) that included testicular volume assessment. Acne was scored by number of comedonal (open plus closed comedones) and inflammatory (papules plus pustules) lesions. Comedonal and inflammatory lesions were analyzed separately and evaluated both as numerical scores and as grades (1, less than or equal to 10 lesions; 2, 11 to 25 lesions; and 3, greater than or equal to 26 lesions). Grades 2 and 3 were considered clinically significant acne. Acne became progressively more severe with advancing maturity. Mean acne scores correlated better with PS and pubic hair than with age. Black subjects were more mature than white subjects. Black boys in PSI and II had significantly more comedones than white boys; white boys had significantly more inflammatory lesions at PS I and III. Clinically significant comedonal acne was already present in PS I and occurred in 100% of boys in PS IV. In contrast, no boys at PS I and only 50% at PS IV had significant inflammatory acne. Midfacial acne dominated. We concluded that acne prevalence and severity correlate well with advancing pubertal maturation in young adolescent boys. Comedonal acne was more frequent and severe than inflammatory disease. Awareness of the extent and severity of acne in preadolescents and young adolescents may ultimately provide rationale for early intervention and thus prevention of severe acne vulgaris.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, the ingestion of tryptophan has been associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is characterized by eosinophilia, myalgias, and several less consistently reported findings. We treated 13 patients who exhibited clinical features of eosinophilic fasciitis who were taking high-dose tryptophan before the onset of clinical symptoms. Twelve patients exhibited eosinophilia, with eosinophil counts ranging from 0.13 to 0.88. The remaining patient was taking oral corticosteroids when her eosinophil count was determined. Eight patients complained of myalgias. Other symptoms included arthralgias, pruritus, cutaneous burning, weakness, fever, rashes, malaise, edema, muscle spasms, and alopecia. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were elevated in four of the eight urine specimens that were tested. Our findings suggest that previously diagnosed cases of eosinophilic fasciitis may represent variants of tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Derangements in the metabolism of tryptophan may play a role in sclerotic diseases.\r"

Circulating IgA anti-intercellular antibodies were also detected by indirect immunofluorescence test. Immunofluorescence studies using monoclonal antibodies to human IgA subclasses showed that these IgA antibodies belonged to IgA1. Antisera against J chain and secretory component did not show any specific intercellular staining. Surface IgA(+)-B cells were transiently increased in the peripheral blood during the active stage of the disease. These results indicated the extragut origin of these IgA antibodies. Dapsone therapy was shown to be very effective.\r"

Clinical findings were lamellar ichthyosiform desquamation on the extremities. The hair was scanty and short on the scalp, in the eyelashes, and in the eyebrows. The nails were hyperkeratotic. Morphologic findings were slight, regular acanthosis and severe diffuse hyperkeratosis with variable parakeratosis. The granular layer was thickened. The papillary dermis showed very slight perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. The most prominent ultrastructural finding was the presence of solitary or multiple droplets of varying size in the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes. Hair analysis revealed no abnormalities; the cystine concentration in hair specimens was normal.\r"

This makes bedside assessment of swallowing safety difficult because one cannot listen for the sound of aspirated material on the vocal cords when a patient is at high risk for silent aspiration and is often unable to cooperate with a videofluoroscopic study. The use of the telephone has been described several times for aphasia treatment, but not to elicit speech or assess swallowing safety early after brain injury. This study, therefore, recruited subjects who had brain injuries and (1) were referred early for swallowing and other evaluations, (2) were out of coma and able to follow some commands, and (3) did not initiate voice or speak when asked to. Subjects were asked three questions under two different conditions: face to face and after ringing the telephone from another room. The results were recorded on videotape and analyzed by another investigator for quantifiable differences. Six of the seven subjects responded better with the telephone stimulus than without. This technique may elicit voice or speech early after brain injury in some patients and may be useful in bedside assessment of swallowing safety. It may also serve as an example of appropriate stimulation of brain injured subjects coming out of coma.\r"

In 35 states drivers submit voluntarily to reevaluation after disabling injuries, but no provision is made for reporting such individuals. Only 15 states authorize physicians to report impaired drivers, and only seven require such reporting. Based on a survey of licensing bureaus in the capital or a major city of every state, clerks (who are likely to be the source of information to injured persons) are generally not aware of reporting requirements and supervisors are only slightly better informed. Of the 100 rehabilitation centers surveyed, only 36 provided on-site training for disabled drivers. Voluntary submission for reevaluation after head injury does not often occur. Despite being asked to do so, none of the 35 head injured patients, followed up to two years post-onset, sought reevaluation, although 21 had resumed regular driving. Two of the 21 were involved in subsequent traffic accidents. Common guidelines need to be established across states to ensure reevaluation of individuals with disabling conditions, delivery of accurate information concerning licensing, and availability of training programs.\r"

Seven surgically dissected gluteus medius muscles were studied in five patients. The lateral surface of the muscle was sequentially probed with an electrical stimulator. The motor point region, which responded maximally to an applied electric current, was located on the posterolateral aspect of the muscle, adjacent to the superior margin of the piriformis, 3 cm lateral to the greater sciatic notch; it was rectangular or oval, measuring approximately 3.5 cm by 3.0 cm. The mean threshold current that produced a contraction was 14 mA (range = 2 to 26 mA). The mean minimum current required to produce a maximum contraction was 34 mA (range = 11 to 60 mA). This information provides guidelines for the placement of electrodes for functional electrical stimulation of this deeply situated muscle, and it provides electrical stimulation parameters required for adequate muscle activation.\r"

The results showed that fatigue in postpolio syndrome usually occurred on a daily basis and increased in severity as the day progressed. Both the study group and controls described their fatigue as tiredness and a lack of energy. However, physical weakness was reported only in the postpolio group. Minimal physical exercise exacerbated fatigue in 48% of the postpolio group, whereas it diminished fatigue in 70% of the controls and in 15% of the postpolio group. Twenty-seven percent of the postpolio group and none of the controls reported mild to moderate depressive symptoms. However, depression, age, alcohol abuse, and employment status did not significantly affect the differences between groups in reported prevalence or description of chronic fatigue. Criteria to separate psychologic from organic causes of fatigue and treatment interventions are discussed.\r"

Group B-1 (n = 18) were patients who had touch sensation but no pin appreciation below the zone of injury. Group B-2 (n = 9) were patients who had partial or complete pin appreciation and light touch below the zone of injury. The charts were examined for the patient's ability to walk independently using a reciprocal gait for at least 200 feet. The data were analyzed by the Fisher Exact test. Eight of the nine Group B-2 patients ambulated as compared to two of the 18 Group B-1 patients (p less than .0002). Frankel B SCI patients with only touch preserved below the zone of injury had poor prognoses for ambulation; those with preserved pin appreciation below the zone of injury had excellent prognoses to regain functional ambulation.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred nine patients with long-bone fracture nonunion, chronic refractory osteomyelitis, or posttraumatic amputation were evaluated for the impact of chronic disability on quality of life, as measured by the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS) and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS). A self-administered PAIS for spouses assessed psychosocial adjustment of spouses or significant others. A final questionnaire ranked the reasons for either continuing medical therapy or accepting amputation. The PAIS scores differed significantly between osteomyelitis patients and both nonunion and amputation patients (p less than .05). The presence or absence of pain produced significant differences in AIMS and PAIS scores of nonunion and osteomyelitis patients (p less than .05). Subscale analysis of AIMS scores revealed significant differences among the three groups in health perception and scale of orthopedic problem: osteomyelitis patients were more severely affected than nonunion or amputation patients. The PAIS detected no statistically significant difference in psychosocial adjustment of spouses of patients in the three population groups. The most common reason for continuing medical and surgical management of nonunion and osteomyelitis was expectation for cure. The amputee group chose ablation to avoid further treatment. Differences in psychosocial and functional ability were related to disease diagnosis, pain, status of fracture healing, and timing of amputation.\r"

Ongoing follow-along and support services averaged 1.64 hours per week at a cost of +47.56. Over 68% of total staff time and costs were expended in job-site training and advocacy efforts. Application of these findings to state-level and agency-level policies should be weighed against individual characteristics and needs of clients, program design, and outcomes which clients achieve as a result of services.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the effect of ultrasound on nerve conduction in patients with polyneuropathy. Eight able-bodied controls (Group C) and 16 patients with clinical and physiologic evidence of polyneuropathy were tested. Eight patients (Group NP) had no aching pain symptoms; eight patients (Group P) had severe aching pain, burning sensation, unpleasant tingling, and/or hyperesthesia in the lower extremities. For two minutes, therapeutic ultrasound in doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5W/cm2 were applied over the anterior surface of the leg along the pathway of the deep peroneal nerve. Peroneal nerve conduction studies were performed before, during, and after ultrasound treatment. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was recorded from the extensor digitorum brevis muscle. Nerve conduction studies on all eight patients in Group P revealed a significant decrease (41.4% and 44% reduced for doses of 1.0W/cm2 and 1.5W/cm2, respectively; p less than .05) in amplitude of CMAP (from baseline to the first negative peak), and an increase (6.4% and 6.7% increased for doses of 1.0W/cm2 and 1.5W/cm2, respectively; p less than .05) in proximal latency one minute after ultrasound application with a dose of 1.0 or 1.5W/cm2, but not with a dose of 0.5W/cm2 (p greater than 0.1). Changes returned to pretreatment values within five minutes of cessation of ultrasound therapy. In Groups C and NP, there were no significant changes in amplitudes of CMAP or proximal latency before, during, or after ultrasound therapy at a dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5W/cm2. It was concluded that ultrasonic therapy with therapeutic dosage may cause a reversible conduction block on patients with painful polyneuropathy.\r"

Final GAS scores were higher for program graduates who obtained the most desirable work outcomes, and preadmission and final PAI scores were lower for the successful program graduates. Final GAS scores were significantly correlated with other outcome measures. Preadmission PAI scores predicted work outcome, and two-month GAS scores predicted final GAS scores. Initial PAI scores distinguished between program successes and failures, but not between program successes and dropouts. A brief look at one case illustrates the modified application of GAS in postacute brain injury rehabilitation. Results of this study and case analyses support GAS as a quantifiable, individualized measure that is useful for (1) monitoring patient progress, (2) structuring team conferences, (3) ongoing rehabilitation planning and decision-making, (4) concise, relevant communication to family, referral sources, and funding sources, and (5) overall program evaluation when used in the context of other objective outcome measures. Although our results support the clinical utility of GAS, further study is recommended to assess the psychometric characteristics of GAS in this application.\r"

One hundred and thirty-five first occurrence stroke patients and their primary support persons were evaluated during the initial hospitalization after stroke and again one year poststroke. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify two groups from the baseline data: home care situations which were rated optimal and those which were not. Group membership was predicted and validated with 72.6% accuracy. Patients at risk for less than optimal home care had caregivers who were (1) more likely to be depressed, (2) less likely to be married to the patient, (3) below average in knowledge about stroke care, and (4) reporting more family dysfunction. Our findings suggest that caregiver-related problems can have a collective effect on rehabilitation outcome and that treatment should reduce caregiver depression, minimize family dysfunction, and increase the family's knowledge about stroke care.\r"

She had rotatory nystagmus in primary position, which increased in amplitude with left gaze. The above signs and symptoms were consistent with lateral medullary syndrome. During her rehabilitation, the patient complained of visual disturbances typical of oscillopsia. These disturbances, or illusions, are compensatory mechanisms for nystagmus and its resultant retinal error. The purpose of this case presentation was to study the pathophysiology underlying oscillopsia in patients with nystagmus and to stimulate awareness of such visual disturbances in stroke patients.\r"

The purpose of this study was to use a time-sequential design to identify the relationship between adjustment after SCI and three facets of aging; chronologic age, time since injury, and time of measurement. Life Situation Questionnaires were obtained from one sample of participants with SCI in 1974 (n = 256) and from a second sample in 1985 (n = 193). Participants were grouped into five cohorts based on chronologic age, five cohorts based on time since injury, and two groups based on time of measurement (1974, 1985). Two two-way MANOVA's were performed, one between chronologic age and time of measurement, and the other between time since injury and time of measurement. Results indicated that chronologic age and time since injury often worked in opposing directions; as some aspects of adjustment declined with greater chronologic age, but other aspects improved with increasing time since injury. Activity was strongly related to chronologic age, but medical stability was more strongly related to time since injury. Both chronologic age and time since injury were correlated with some aspects of life satisfaction. Comparisons between the two times of measurement (1974, 1985) indicated some limited positive changes in adjustment with time. The results point to the complexity of the relationship between aging and adjustment and the need for rehabilitation professionals to consider multiple aging factors.\r"

A questionnaire was designed to assess several aspects of grand rounds, including format, objectives, popularity, and changes over time. The questionnaire was directed to department heads of 122 U.S. medical schools. Seventy-five percent of respondents were department chairs; the remainder were chief residents and other faculty. Survey response rate was 96%. According to respondents, the major objective of grand rounds was to provide \"updates in diagnosis and treatment.\" Case presentations were regularly included in about one third of departments; patients were rarely present for examination or interview. The popularity of grand rounds was thought to have decreased. These data support the impression that medical grand rounds is still considered important in most academic medical centers. Suggestions are made for increasing the clinical relevance of the conference. New techniques for presenting clinical material are reviewed, and an argument is made for returning to a basic strategy of \"solving the patient's problem.\"\r"

Recent studies, using a variety of internal fixation techniques, have described high complication rates at the mandibular angle. This article compares the use of one miniplate vs two miniplates in treatment of angle fractures. Since September 1985, 61 patients with 63 mandibular angle fractures have been treated with miniplates. Forty-four fractures were fixed with two miniplates. Six complications (3.1%) occurred, five of which were in the one-miniplate group. The complication rate in the double-miniplate group is the lowest reported of any plating technique. The use of two miniplates has proved to be an effective method of treating mandibular angle fractures.\r"

Performing the necessary anterior, and possibly posterior, incisions to expand the cricoid and tracheal rings causes instability of the segments. Placing an intraluminal stent has several disadvantages, ranging from injury of healthy tissue to airway obstruction. The availability of an external stent would avoid many of these complications. We performed expansion laryngeal surgery in dogs and explored the use of microplates for external fixation and determined the surgical outcome if no fixation is used. The results show that microplates are very effective in maintaining external fixation and that a need for placing an intraluminal stent when a posterior cricoid split is performed exists.\r"

Epinephrine, the standard drug for vasoconstriction, has some limitations due to potential cardiac and local toxic effects. Using an animal model, we compared the effects of various concentrations of epinephrine and two other vasoconstrictors, phenylephrine hydrochloride and felypressin, on local blood flow. We also examined the local effects of bupivacaine hydrochloride and ropivacaine hydrochloride, a new local anesthetic. We found that felypressin was as effective a vasoconstrictor as epinephrine, with fewer potential toxic reactions. Phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine), on the other hand, was less effective, with a shorter duration of action. As expected, bupivacaine produced vasodilation, while ropivacaine was found to have vasoconstrictive properties.\r"

To identify trends in clinical research, a survey of 1831 articles in four otolaryngology journals spanning a 20-year period was performed. Clinical research comprised 77% of all articles and has steadily increased in volume. Significant trends have occurred toward multiple authorship, more female first authors, and a declining proportion of articles with grant support. In 1989, a total of 224 articles (40%) employed analytic or experimental study designs vs only 64 articles (18%) in 1969. Descriptive studies and review articles have declined in prevalence. These findings suggest that over the past two decades, clinical research in otolaryngology journals has increased in both quantity and quality.\r"
