The study was planned to include patients with previous bleeding from esophageal varices randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. After the inclusion of the first 11 patients (6 in the polidocanol group and 5 in the alcohol group), however, the trial was interrupted because of serious complications in patients treated with alcohol (four major bleeding episodes and one esophageal stenosis). The two agents were of comparable efficacy in the small sample of patients studied. The complications were related to the presence of iatrogenic esophageal ulcers which were more frequent (100% vs. 30%) and significantly larger (mean, 1.4 cm vs. 0.7 cm, p less than 0.05) in patients treated with alcohol.\r"

  ".W": "Cough and bronchoconstriction are airway reflexes that protect the lung from inspired noxious agents. These two reflexes can be evoked both from the larynx and tracheobronchial tree and also from some extrarespiratory sites. Within the airways, certain sites are particularly sensitive to stimulation of cough (larynx and points of proximal airway branching), whereas bronchoconstriction can be triggered from the whole of the tracheobronchial tree. In the larynx, \"irritant\" receptors with myelinated afferents mediate cough and bronchoconstriction. Little seems to be known about laryngeal nonmyelinated afferents and their reflexes. In the tracheobronchial tree and lung, slowly adapting stretch receptors (SARs) and rapidly adapting stretch receptors (RARs) have opposing effects on airway tone, the former mediating bronchodilation and the latter bronchoconstriction. In cough, on the other hand, they operate concurrently, a mediatory role for RARs and a facilitatory role for SARs. C-fiber endings (bronchial and pulmonary) mediate bronchoconstriction. Inhalation of so-called \"selective\" C-fiber stimulants induces cough, but excitation of RARs has not been eliminated, and the possibility also exists that the cough is secondary to other lung actions mediated by these nerve endings. Although cough and bronchoconstriction may be mediated by the same type of receptor, they seem to have separate afferent neural pathways.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism by which increased pleural pressure (Ppl) assists left ventricular (LV) ejection, we compared the effects of phasic systolic or diastolic increases in Ppl (40-60 mmHg) with use of an isolated canine heart-lung preparation with constant venous return. Positive Ppl during systole (S) caused left atrial transmural pressure (Platm = Pla - Ppl) to decrease by 1.25 +/- 0.46 (SE) mmHg (P less than 0.025). Central blood volume (CBV), the volume of blood in the heart, lungs, and thoracic great vessels, decreased by 29 +/- 4.0 (SE) ml (P less than 0.001). When Ppl was raised for an equal duration during diastole (D), the decrease in Platm was not significant, but there was a significant decrease in CBV (10.5 +/- 4.1 ml, P less than 0.05). With constant venous return, these changes suggested that phasic elevations in Ppl in either S or D assisted LV ejection by decreasing LV afterload. To test the hypothesis that positive Ppl during D reduced afterload by emptying the thoracic aorta, we compared the effects of diastolic positive Ppl with a rigid aorta vs. a compliant aorta. Although there was no statistical difference in the effects of diastolic positive Ppl on Platm, the decrease in CBV was significantly greater when the aorta was compliant than when it was rigid (23 +/- 2.2 vs. 17 +/- 2.7 ml, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Regional lung ventilation is modulated by the spatiotemporal distribution of alveolar distending forces. During positive-pressure ventilation, regional transmission of airway pressure (Paw) to the pleural surface may vary with ventilatory frequency (f), thus changing interregional airflow distribution. Pendelluft phenomena may result owing to selective regional hyperventilation or phase differences in alveolar distension. To define the effects of f on regional alveolar distension during positive-pressure ventilation, we compared regional pleural pressure (Ppl) swings from expiration to inspiration (delta Ppl) and end-expiratory Ppl over the f range 0-150 min-1 in anesthetized, paralyzed, close-chested dogs with normal lungs. We inserted six pleural balloon catheters to analyze Ppl distribution along three orthogonal axes of the right hemithorax. Increases in regional Ppl were synchronously coupled with inspiratory increases in Paw regardless of f. However, at a constant tidal volume and percent inspiratory time, end-expiratory Paw and Ppl increased in all regions once a f threshold was reached (P less than 0.01). Supradiaphragmatic delta Ppl were less than in other regions (P less than 0.05), but thoracoabdominal binding abolished this difference by decreasing thoracoabdominal compliance. We conclude that the distribution of forces determining dynamic regional alveolar distension are temporally synchronous but spatially asymmetric during positive-pressure ventilation at f less than or equal to 150/min.\r"

The purpose of this review is to speculate how recent advances in the fields of molecular and cell biology might be applied to exercise physiology to provide greater insights into the mechanisms underlying adaptations to a single bout of exercise and to repeated bouts of exercise (training). The review is organized to consider the actions occurring outside the cell, through the cellular membrane and cytoplasm to the nucleus. These topics are as follows: blood-borne signals, polypeptide growth factors, membrane receptors (insulin receptor, adrenergic receptors, acetylcholine receptors, phosphorylation of receptors, and mutant receptors), transduction through the plasmalemma (glucose transporters and G proteins), second messengers (phosphatidylinositol phosphates and calcium), cis sequences required for muscle-specific gene expression, transcriptional regulation by physiological signals, and gene expression. Exercise physiology is a challenging discipline that integrates molecules, cell-to-cell interaction, tissues, and the whole organism during the physiological stress of exercise by the live, unanesthetized animal.\r"

We studied 10 mechanically ventilated patients with exacerbated CAO and air trapping to determine the impact of PEEP on lung mechanics, alveolar pressure, and the work of breathing. PEEP levels of 5 and 10 cmH2O were applied to patients whose end-expiratory alveolar pressures were documented to be positive when breathing against ambient pressure (the auto-PEEP effect). All patients were studied under two conditions: every breath machine assisted (AMV) and every breath machine controlled (paralyzed, CMV). PEEP improved expiratory resistance without substantially increasing peak static pressure. Inspiratory resistance remained unchanged. The difference between the end-expiratory values of alveolar and central airway pressure narrowed as PEEP increased. Adding PEEP improved the effective triggering sensitivity of the ventilator, diminished ventilatory drive, and reduced the mechanical work of breathing during the machine-assisted ventilatory cycle. Our results indicate that low levels of PEEP may improve lung mechanics and reduce the effort required of mechanically ventilated patients with severe airflow obstruction, without substantially increasing the hazards of hyperinflation.\r"

To determine whether endotoxin would prolong survival and influence antioxidant enzyme levels in lambs whose physiological response to O2 breathing can be serially measured, we administered a single intravenous dose of endotoxin (0.75 microgram/kg body wt) to 13 lambs before exposing them to greater than 95% O2 (n = 11) or air (n = 2). Seven additional lambs were placed in O2 after receiving only saline vehicle. All lambs had been instrumented to measure pulmonary vascular pressures and cardiac output, and 10 lambs had lung lymph fistulas. O2-exposed control lambs developed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and respiratory failure within 85 +/- 10 h (range 76-110 h); antioxidant enzymes were not increased, but reduced glutathione (GSH) levels fell and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) increased, reflecting the oxidant stress of O2 exposure. By contrast, endotoxin-treated O2-exposed lambs had a delayed increase in microvascular permeability to protein, a reduced rate of lung edema formation, normal gas exchange after 72 h in O2, and prolonged survival (136 +/- 15 h; range 90-160 h; all variables P less than 0.05). Despite prolonged survival, postmortem lung water content was no greater in the lambs that received endotoxin. Treatment with endotoxin did not increase antioxidant enzyme levels in lung homogenate, but levels of GSH relative to GSSG were significantly elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89033547\r", 
  ".W": "We recently reported that endotoxin infusion before O2 exposure significantly reduced or delayed the onset of pulmonary edema formation and respiratory failure by reducing the oxidant stress of O2 exposure. Despite these beneficial effects of endotoxin treatment, lung microvascular permeability eventually increased, but postmortem lung water content was less than expected. Prolonged O2 breathing blunts or abolishes the pulmonary constrictor response to alveolar hypoxia in some species, and it is possible that the loss of this response could contribute further to edema formation. To determine whether the reduction in lung edema observed in endotoxin-treated, O2-exposed lambs was linked to the preservation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), we measured pulmonary vascular resistance before and after 8 min of isocarbic hypoxia (inspired O2 fraction 0.12) during each day of O2 exposure. In six control lambs, the pressor response to hypoxia was abolished after 72 h in O2, and the lambs developed respiratory failure shortly thereafter. In six endotoxin-treated lambs, HPV was preserved for as long as 144 h of O2 exposure. In two control O2-exposed lambs in whom HPV was abolished, the infusion of either angiotensin or prostaglandin H2 analogue increased pulmonary vascular resistance by greater than 75%. We conclude that in lambs 1) hyperoxia abolishes the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia, 2) endotoxin pretreatment reduces acute O2-induced lung injury and preserves the pulmonary constrictor response to hypoxia, and 3) the loss of HPV during O2 exposure may be the result of oxidant-mediated injury to the hypoxia response itself and not the result of diffuse damage to the vasoconstrictor effector mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "We measured airway responsiveness to methacholine (MCh) of highly inbred rats before and after six inhalational challenges with antigen. Ten Brown-Norway rats (130-216 g) that were actively sensitized to ovalbumin (OA) received six challenges with OA at 5-day intervals beginning 19 days after sensitization. An aerosol of OA (5% wt/vol) was inhaled for 1, 2, 5, and 10 min or until pulmonary resistance (RL) increased by at least 50%. Challenges with aerosolized MCh were performed immediately before and 14 days after sensitization, 2 days after the 3rd OA exposure, and 2, 7, 12, and 17 days after the 6th OA challenge. Four unsensitized rats underwent inhalational challenges with MCh over an equivalent time period. Responsiveness to MCh was calculated as the concentration of MCh required to increase RL to 200% of the control value (EC200RL). Seven out of 10 rats in the experimental group reacted to the first OA challenge with an immediate increase in RL of greater than 50% of control (range 70-550%). Three animals were unreactive to OA. Base-line EC200RL for all rats undergoing sensitization was 2.13 mg/ml (geometric mean), and it did not change significantly after sensitization (2.05 mg/ml). However, EC200RL of the rats that reacted to OA (n = 7) decreased significantly after 3 (1.11 mg/ml; P less than 0.005) and 6 OA exposures (0.96 mg/ml; P less than 0.005). The increase in responsiveness to inhaled MCh was present 17 days after the last OA exposure (EC200RL = 1.40 mg/ml; P less than 0.05). EC200RL of neither the unreactive sensitized rats (n = 3) nor the control rats (n = 4) changed after OA challenges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When fed a sweet placebo throughout exercise, plasma glucose and respiratory exchange ratio (R) declined (P less than 0.05) from 5.0 +/- 0.1 mM and 0.91 +/- 0.01 after 30 min (i.e., at 85% VO2max) to 3.7 +/- 0.3 mM and 0.79 +/- 0.01 at fatigue (i.e., when the subjects were unable to continue exercise at 60% VO2max). Carbohydrate feeding throughout exercise (1 g/kg at 10 min, then 0.6 g/kg every 30 min) increased plasma glucose to approximately 6 mM and partially prevented this decline in carbohydrate oxidation, allowing the men to perform 19% more work (2.74 +/- 0.13 vs. 2.29 +/- 0.09 MJ, P less than 0.05) before fatiguing. Even when fed carbohydrate, however, by the 3rd h of exercise, R had fallen from 0.92 to 0.87, accompanied by a reduction in exercise intensity from approximately 85% to approximately 75% VO2max (both P less than 0.05). These data indicate that carbohydrate feedings enable trained cyclists to exercise at up to 75% VO2max and to oxidize carbohydrate at up to 2 g/min during the later stages of prolonged intense exercise.\r"

Compared with age-matched controls the young (YS) and adult suspended (AS) rats had lower soleus and body weights and insulin levels (P less than 0.05). Per milligram of protein, insulin binding, 2-DG uptake, and the rate of glycolysis were increased by approximately 200%, and the rate of glycogenesis was increased approximately 100% in the YS group (P less than 0.05). Except for a reduction in glycogenesis (P less than 0.05) all other parameters also increased in the AS rats (P less than 0.05). On the basis of the whole muscle the rate of glucose metabolism (glycogenesis + glycolysis) was reduced in the YS rats (P less than 0.05), but in the AS rats glucose metabolism was similar to the controls. Thus the increased glucose metabolism (i.e., per milligram of protein) in the YS and AS groups may represent a compensatory response by atrophied muscle to attempt to sustain glucose removal from the circulation. Because greater insulin binding occurred in YS muscle [35% slow-twitch (ST)] than in the control group (70% ST), and greater insulin binding occurred in the AS (81% ST) than in the control group (90% ST), higher insulin binding capacities are not always related to a high proportion of ST muscle fibers. In conclusion, after hindlimb suspension, marked increments in insulin binding and glucose metabolism occur in the soleus muscle.\r"

In seven dogs placement of the EMF on the main pulmonary artery (MPA) increased pulmonary arterial pulse pressure by 25% (17.8-21.9 cmH2O, P less than 0.005) and mean right ventricular pressure by 12% (23.2-25.9 cmH2O, P less than 0.001) but did not alter heart rate, systemic blood pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, or right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. This response was not abolished by local application of lidocaine to the MPA. In three cats input impedance was calculated from measurements of pressure and flow in the MPA. Impedance was calculated with flow measured using an EMF and ultrasonic volume flow probe (USF), which avoids the constraining effect of the EMF. When flow was measured with an EMF rather than a USF, there was a significant difference in the impedance spectra (P less than 0.001), but it was only apparent in the moduli greater than six harmonics. We conclude that the EMF does affect right ventricular afterload in acute experiments and alters the measured input impedance.\r"

To determine whether specific autonomic receptors regulating ciliary beat frequency (CBF) were located on mucosal or serosal sides, we measured CBF by heterodyne mode correlation analysis laser light scattering in bovine tracheal tissues mounted in a two-sided chamber. A beta 2-adrenergic agonist, fenoterol, at 10(-7) M, stimulated serosal CBF from 7.9 +/- 1.3 to 20.2 +/- 5.8 Hz (P less than 0.01) and mucosal CBF from 6.6 +/- 0.9 to 14.7 +/- 4.6 Hz (P less than 0.01). A muscarinic cholinergic agonist, methacholine, at 10(-7) M, increased mucosal CBF from 8.4 +/- 1.0 to 19.5 +/- 5.5 Hz (P less than 0.01) and serosal CBF from 8.0 +/- 0.9 to 15.4 +/- 5.0 Hz (P less than 0.01). The differences in stimulation of CBF on the mucosal and serosal sides between fenoterol and methacholine were significant (P less than 0.01). Studies in which these autonomic agonist stimulating effects were inhibited by their respective antagonists, propranolol and atropine sulfate, demonstrated that CBF can be regulated independently by mediators both in the submucosa and within the mucus lining.\r"

All of the tibial components were from the same design of total knee replacement. The two groups of patients from whom the components were retrieved did not differ with regard to weight, the length of time that the component had been implanted, the radiographic position and angular alignment of the component, the original diagnosis, or the reason for removal of the component. The amounts and types of damage that were observed did not differ for the two materials. For both materials, the amount of damage was directly related to the length of time that the component had been implanted. The histological appearance of tissues from the area around the component did not differ for the two materials, except for the presence of fragments of carbon fiber in many of the samples from the areas around carbon fiber-reinforced components.\r"

The amount of lateral patellar tilt was quantitatively assessed using the lateral patellofemoral angle, as described by Laurin et al., and the congruence angle, as described by Merchant et al. In both the control subjects and the patients, the angle of Laurin et al. changed significantly when the knee was flexed from full extension to 30 degrees. The difference between the groups was statistically significant at each angle of flexion of the knee, and the difference between the groups was most prominent on the computed tomography scans that were made with the knee in full extension (p less than 0.001). In the patients, the average congruence angle (as described by Merchant et al.) was 5 degrees and in the control subjects, -10 degrees. This indicated that, in our patients, the extent of the patellar subluxation was less than that in previously reported series, and, as a result, the sensitivity of the congruence angle in diagnosing patellar subluxation was only 0.30. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of the computed tomography scans for diagnosing patellar subluxation were 0.96 and 0.90, respectively--that is, they were higher than the values that were obtained using any axial roentgenograms. Thus, our results indicated that patellar subluxation can be detected more accurately by using computed tomography with the knee in full extension than by using conventional axial roentgenograms.\r"

Technical points, such as an oval window on the wall of the vein and a few sutures piercing only two lymphatic layers, adventitia and media, outside the lumen for successful results are emphasized. Three methods for assessment of patency of anastomoses were used: (1) observation with operating microscope of dye transit across the anastomotic site; (2) lymphography, and (3) histopathologic examination. Of 23 dogs, five were used to perfect the technique, three died after operation, while the remaining 15 were divided into three groups of five dogs each. In the first group which were explored one month after surgery, all anastomoses were patent (100% patency). In the second group, explored three months after surgery, one anastomosis was obstructed and four were patent (80% patency). In the third group, explored six months after surgery, one anastomosis was obstructed and four were patent (80% patency). The results obtained with this technique and the occurrence of a similar physiological lympho-venous anastomosis suggest that end-to-side anastomosis may be the technique of choice.\r"

  ".W": "This study was done to compare the actions of pulsatile and continuous insulin administration in eight noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients. Human insulin was delivered in a pulsatile manner (1.3 mU/kg.min for 2 min, followed by 11 min during which no insulin was infused) or continuously (0.2 mU/kg.min) for 325 min. Endogenous hormone secretion was inhibited by somatostatin (125 micrograms/h), and glucagon was replaced at rate of 3.5 micrograms/h. Under these conditions plasma C-peptide levels fell progressively to extremely low values at the end of the experiment. Continuous insulin infusion resulted in steady plasma insulin levels, averaging 86 pmol/L, while during intermittent insulin administration plasma insulin levels were 5.7 and 158 pmol/L before and 3 min after the start of the insulin injection, respectively. Basal plasma glucagon [mean 158 +/- 11 (+/- SE) vs. 163 +/- 21 ng/L; P = NS] levels were similar on both occasions. During replacement peripheral plasma glucagon levels were no different whatever the mode of insulin administration, nor did they differ from the basal values. The mean plasma glucose concentrations were similar before both studies and rose to 9.5 and 8.6 mmol/L in the first 65 min during continuous and pulsatile insulin administration, respectively. In contrast, during the last 65 min, plasma glucose averaged 6.2 mmol/L during both studies. The glucose infusion rate initially increased, but then rapidly fell to values close to zero at the end of the first 65 min during the continuous insulin infusion, whereas during this time it averaged 0.59 +/- 0.10 mg/kg.min (32.5 +/- 5.5 mumol/kg.min) during pulsatile insulin administration. In the last 65 min the glucose infusion rate was significantly higher during pulsatile than during continuous insulin delivery. Furthermore, pulsatile rather than continuous insulin administration significantly reduced plasma triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein triglyceride, and FFA levels and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein-B levels. We conclude that pulsatile insulin delivery has advantageous metabolic effects compared to continuous hormone administration in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

We evaluated, with the use of the highly selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan, the role of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. A glucose infusion test (GIT) was performed after the administration of idazoxan or placebo in normal men (n = 15) and men with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (n = 6). The normal men were divided into two groups on the basis of high (n = 8) and low (n = 7) insulin responses to prior GITs. The blood glucose and plasma insulin and C-peptide responses to the GIT were similar after idazoxan (40 mg, orally) or placebo treatment in all three groups, although the responses differed among the groups. In the diabetic group iv administration of idazoxan 20 min before the GIT did not alter the insulin response to the GIT. We conclude that alpha 2-adrenergic blockade does not affect glucose-induced insulin secretion in normal men, nor does it improve the impaired first phase of insulin secretion in low insulin responders and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients. Phentolamine probably stimulates insulin secretion by a mechanism not involving alpha 2-adrenergic receptors directly.\r"

Insulin secretory rates were calculated according to a two-compartment model of distribution for C-peptide, using individual C-peptide kinetics calculated from iv bolus injections of biosynthetic human C-peptide. The mean plasma glucose level increased from a fasting level of 5.1 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) to a peak of 24.0 +/- 1.0 mmol/L at 3 min and reached basal levels 101 +/- 6 min after glucose administration. The mean serum insulin value increased from 50 +/- 12 to a peak of 405 +/- 58 pmol/L at 3 min and then declined to fasting levels 139 +/- 14 min after the stimulus. In contrast, the mean plasma C-peptide level increased from 390 +/- 50 to a peak of 1460 +/- 210 pmol/L at 3 min and only began declining 45 min after glucose administration, reaching fasting levels 191 +/- 15 min after the stimulus. The mean insulin secretory rate increased from 69.8 +/- 19.9 to a peak of 1412.7 +/- 159.1 pmol/min at 3 min (15.3 +/- 2.5-fold elevation over baseline) and reached basal levels 135 +/- 12 min after the stimulus. The clearance of endogenous insulin during the basal period (2.505 +/- 0.365 L/min) and that during the 4 h after the stimulus (2.319 +/- 0.230 L/min) were similar. In conclusion, after bolus iv glucose administration: 1) the insulin secretory rate is more closely represented by changes in peripheral serum insulin than in plasma C-peptide levels; and 2) no change in endogenous insulin clearance occurs.\r"

The plasma BP-28 levels increased 12-fold from 8 +/- 2 (+/-SE) micrograms/L at 2100 h to a peak level of 109 +/- 15 micrograms/L between 0600 and 0800 h. This rise was inversely related to plasma insulin levels and was unrelated to plasma cortisol levels. The overnight rise of plasma BP-28 was significantly altered in children who ate a light meal at 0130 h; in them BP-28 levels started to fall after 0300 h, reached nadir levels at 0400 h, began to rise again by 0700 h, and returned to control levels by 0800 h. Such changes did not occur in children given water alone. From the peak early morning level, plasma BP-28 fell to basal levels in children given oral glucose at 0800 h; the t1/2 of the fall was 55 +/- 9 (+/-SE) min. In children who continued to fast, plasma BP-28 did not fall but, rather, increased from 144 +/- 12 micrograms/L at 0800 h after 10 h of fasting to 239 +/- 30 micrograms/L by 1600 h. The induction of hypoglycemia by insulin given at 0945 h after an overnight fast caused a similar but more rapid rise in plasma BP-28 to 668 +/- 317 micrograms/L (range, 208-1763 micrograms/L) by 1230 h. These results suggest that the diurnal variation of plasma BP-28 concentrations in children is not due to an intrinsic rhythm, but is regulated by the metabolic status of the child.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to quantitate glucose and FFA disposal by muscle tissue in patients with type II diabetes and to investigate the relationship between FFA metabolism and insulin resistance. The forearm perfusion technique was used in six normal subjects and two groups of normal weight diabetic patients, i.e. untreated (n = 8) and insulin-treated (n = 6). The latter received 2 weeks of intensive insulin therapy before the study. Plasma insulin levels were raised acutely [950-1110 pmol/L) (130-150 microU/mL)], while the blood glucose concentration was clamped at its basal value [4.9 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) mmol/L in the normal subjects, 5.7 +/- 0.5 in the insulin-treated diabetic patients, and 5.5 +/- 0.3 in the untreated diabetic patients] by a variable glucose infusion. During the control period, arterial FFA concentrations were similar in the three groups, and they decreased to a comparable extent (less than 0.1 mmol/L) in response to insulin infusion. During the control period, the mean forearm FFA uptake was 2.5 +/- 0.5 mumol/L.min in the normal subjects, 2.9 +/- 0.5 in the insulin-treated patients, and 2.1 +/- 0.5 in the untreated diabetic patients. During the insulin infusion, FFA uptake was profoundly suppressed to similar levels in the normal subjects (0.9 +/- 0.1 mumol/L.min), the insulin-treated diabetic patients (1.1 +/- 0.3), and the untreated diabetic patients (0.9 +/- 0.1; P less than 0.001). Forearm glucose uptake was similar in the three groups during the control period. It increased during the insulin infusion, but the response in both diabetic groups was less than that in the normal subjects. The total amounts of glucose taken up by the forearm during the study period were 5.2 +/- 0.7, 2.6 +/- 0.5, and 2.1 +/- 0.6 mmol/L.min in the normal subjects, the insulin-treated diabetic patients, and the untreated diabetic patients, respectively (P less than 0.01). We conclude that 1) insulin-mediated glucose uptake by forearm skeletal muscle is markedly impaired in type II diabetes and improves only marginally after 2 weeks of intensive insulin therapy; 2) in contrast, no appreciable abnormality in forearm FFA metabolism is demonstrable in insulin-treated type II diabetic patients; and 3) FFA do not contribute to the insulin-treated skeletal muscle insulin resistance that occurs in patients with type II diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Aging is associated with a progressive decrease in glucose tolerance. This decrease is associated with insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. This study was performed to evaluate the possible role of dietary factors in the glucose intolerance of aging. Two groups of men were studied: one young (Y; n = 8; age range, 18-36 yr) and one elderly (E; n = 10; age range, 65-82 yr). Frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance tests were performed in random order: 1) during ad libitum home dietary conditions; 2) after a 3- to 5-day regimen of very high (85%) carbohydrate intake; and 3) after a 3- to 5-day regimen of low (30%) carbohydrate intake (Y only). From the frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test data, we calculated the glucose disappearance rate (Kg) and metabolic parameters according to the minimal model method, including the insulin sensitivity index (S1) and the first and second phase beta-cell responsivity to glucose (phi 1 and phi 2). The elderly men, while eating an ad libitum diet, were less tolerant to glucose than the young [mean Kg: E = 1.5 +/- 0.2% (+/- SE) min-1; Y = 2.3 +/- 0.3% min-1; P less than 0.025], had relative insulin resistance (mean Si: Y = 6.1 +/- 1.1; E = 2.4 +/- 0.7 min-1 10(-4)/(microU/mL) [0.85 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.10 min-1 10(-4)/(pmol/L)]; P less than 0.01), and lesser second phase beta-cell responsiveness to glucose (mean phi 2: Y = 18.5 +/- 3.6; E = 8.7 +/- 2.7 (microU/mL).min-2/(mg/dL) [2390 +/- 465 vs. 1120 +/- 349 (pmol/L).min-2/(mmol/L)]; P less than 0.05). A maximum improvement in Kg and S1 occurred at 41% carbohydrate feeding in the young men, whereas in the elderly men there was a significant increase in both of these parameters while eating the very high (85%) carbohydrate diet. Thus, the difference in glucose tolerance between groups was corrected by the very high carbohydrate diet (mean Kg: Y = 2.2 +/- 0.2%; E = 2.0 +/- 0.3%/min; P greater than 0.05), as was the age-related difference in insulin sensitivity (mean S1: Y = 5.6 +/- 1.2; E = 4.4 +/- 1.3 min-1 10(-4)/(microU/mL) [0.78 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.18 min-1 10(-4)/(pmol/L)]; P greater than 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Using ultrasonic scanning, we measured thyroid volume in 17 euthyroid patients with acromegaly and examined the relationships among thyroid size, plasma GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) levels, and serum thyroglobulin (TG) levels. The mean estimated thyroid volume in these 17 patients was 32.8 +/- 15.5 (+/- SD) mL, significantly larger than that in normal subjects (15.4 +/- 3.1 mL), and 64.7% of the patients had multinodular goiter, as identified by ultrasonography. Thyroid volume was positively correlated with plasma GH and IGF-I levels and heel-pad thickness, but not with the serum TSH level. In 7 patients, thyroid volume decreased in association with a decline in plasma GH and IGF-I levels after surgical treatment. The serum TG level was elevated in 7 of the 15 patients in whom it was measured, and the mean value was 51.7 +/- 62.7 (+/- SD) micrograms/L (normal, 12.6 +/- 6.4 micrograms/L). We found no correlations among the serum TG and TSH levels, plasma GH and IGF-I concentrations, and/or thyroid volume. However, serum TG decreased after surgical treatment, just as did plasma IGF-I. These observations together with the results of recent in vitro studies by others suggest that IGF-I is one of the factors involved in goiter formation, but the elevated serum TG levels in acromegaly are controlled not only by IGF-I but also by other factors.\r"

  ".W": "Ectopic expression of HLA class II antigens by thyroid follicular cells (TFC) might trigger the immune recognition of TFC-specific surface constituents by self-reactive T helper/inducer lymphocytes, with the consequent generation of organ-specific autoimmunity. To explore the alternative possibilities underlying this ectopic expression, i.e. that it either reflects a primary abnormality of the TFC or is secondarily induced by the autoimmune attack itself, we employed immunofluorescence staining of monolayers cultured from thyroid tissue of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease as well as neoplastic, nodular, and normal thyroid tissues to assess the role that autologous mononuclear leukocytes (MNC) and serum factors play in HLA class II induction and modulation in vitro. In all Graves' disease (GD) tissues that initially displayed HLA-DR (DR) antigens, this expression was transient. Primary TFC cultures from tissues with tumor-associated chronic thyroiditis (CT) showed more widespread and persistent DR expression than did cultures from GD tissues. However, in contrast with the findings in GD, there was no correlation between ectopic DR expression on TFC from the CT areas and the presence of organ-specific autoimmune markers. DR expression by TFC was detected in only one of the five nontoxic nodules studied, and involved a small proportion (approximately 20%) of the TFC. A similarly low proportion of DR-positive TFC was found in cultures from two papillary carcinomas, while much stronger DR expression was seen on TFC cultured from the contralateral lobes affected with CT. Only one of four follicular adenomas expressed DR on about 35% of the cultured TFC. In contrast with the rapid extinction of DR expression on TFC cultured from GD tissues after depletion of infiltrated MNC, DR antigen loss did not occur or was significantly delayed when parallel TFC monolayers were cocultured in the presence of autologous MNC from the intrathyroidal infiltrates. Coculture of DR-negative TFC from normal tissues with autologous peripheral blood MNC in individuals without detectable thyroid autosensitization also resulted in pronounced induction of DR expression on the TFC. Purified T lymphocytes from the same peripheral blood MNC preparations, however, did not induce DR expression on these normal TFC. Similarly, MNC obtained from two follicular adenomas, mostly macrophages, did not induce DR expression when cultured with autologous TFC from the same lesions. Addition of 15% autologous serum did not prevent progressive extinction of DR expression on TFC cultured from GD or tumor-associated CT tissues after depletion of infiltrated MNC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The food vacuole appears to be analogous to the secondary lysosomes of mammalian cells. To determine the enzymatic mechanism of hemoglobin degradation, we incubated trophozoite-infected erythrocytes with peptide inhibitors of different classes of proteinases. Leupeptin and L-transepoxy-succinyl-leucyl-amido-(4-guanidino)-butane (E-64), two peptide inhibitors of cysteine proteinases, inhibited the proteolysis of globin and caused the accumulation of undegraded erythrocyte cytoplasm in parasite food vacuoles, suggesting that a food vacuole cysteine proteinase is necessary for hemoglobin degradation. Proteinase assays of trophozoites demonstrated cysteine proteinase activity with a pH optimum similar to that of the food vacuole and the substrate specificity of lysosomal cathepsin L. We also identified an Mr 28,000 proteinase that was trophozoite stage-specific and was inhibited by leupeptin and E-64. We conclude that the Mr 28,000 cysteine proteinase has a critical, perhaps rate-limiting, role in hemoglobin degradation within the food vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum. Specific inhibitors of this enzyme might provide new means of antimalarial chemotherapy.\r"

In the latter case, the clusters are predominantly CD4+ T cells (T4/T8 greater than 5) and with time progress in blastic cells that express IL-2 (Tac) and/or transferrin (T9) receptors. In contrast, the clusters in RA SF cultures have a T4/T8 ratio of less than 1 and a majority of the T8 cells coexpress the Leu 7 marker. T cells in these clusters remain inert and with time the clusters disintegrate. Addition of IL-1, IL-2, or IFN-gamma alone or in combination had no effect on RA SF clusters but T cells became blastic when exposed to 10% RA SF. Mixing experiments using RA SF DC with normal T cells and RA T cells with normal DC show that both RA SF DC and T cells are immunofunctional. In addition, clusters of RA SF from a patient with active tuberculosis proliferated vigorously to PPD. Therefore, the unique RA SF cluster profile may reflect the memory nature of the RA SF T cells resulting in a paucity of T cells that are responsive to autologous stimulation. However, an immunosuppressive role for the double-labeled (CD8 and Leu 7) cells has not been excluded.\r"

  ".W": "Little information exists concerning differing levels of regulation occurring during human megakaryocyte development. We hypothesize that megakaryocytic proliferation and maturation is controlled by two, synergistic regulatory factors. One, megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity, is an obligate requirement for colony formation and drives the development of relatively immature cells. Megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity is a functional component of the human recombinant proteins, interleukin 3 or GM-CSF. Human recombinant growth factors, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, or crythropoietin, do not effect megakaryocyte development either alone or in combination with interleukin 3. Full maturation requires a second synergistic activity which increases megakaryocyte number, size, and cytoplasmic and antigenic content. In culture, this synergistic regulator augments maturation by increasing the number of colonies, colony cellularity, and size. In suspension cultures, this cofactor increases megakaryocyte cytoplasmic and antigenic content, and shifts the morphological distribution from immature to mature megakaryocytes. Finally, this activity also increases the number of antigen positive megakaryocytes, either by stimulating proliferation or conversion of antigen-negative to antigen-positive cells. Comparative studies of megakaryocytic regulation suggests that this in vitro regulator mimicks some of the known effects of thrombopoietin in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human keratinocytes have been shown to produce IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA and protein. IL-1 biological activity has been identified in normal human epidermis; in vitro, most biologically active IL-1 resides in a cell-associated compartment. The potential for autocrine effects of IL-1 on human keratinocytes was assessed by measurement of keratinocyte IL-1 receptors. Both high- and low-affinity cell surface receptors that bound recombinant (r) IL-1 alpha and beta with comparable affinities could be identified on cultured human keratinocytes, using 125I-labeled rIL-1. Chemical crosslinking experiments identified a cell surface molecule of roughly 72,500 Mr that bound 125I-labeled IL-1, similar to the molecular weight of previously described IL-1 receptors on fibroblasts, B cells, and T cells. To assess the biological consequences of keratinocyte IL-1 binding, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene expression was measured. The addition of exogenous rIL-1 alpha led to a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA, as measured by a sensitive and specific S1 nuclease assay. This increase in mRNA was reflected in a marked increase in GM-CSF biological activity as measured by proliferation of blast cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. The biological activity was completely inhibitable by an antibody to human rGM-CSF. GM-CSF activates mature neutrophils and macrophages and appears to enhance the efficiency of Langerhans cell antigen presentation to T cells. Release of IL-1 from injured or activated keratinocytes may lead to enhanced epidermal GM-CSF gene expression via an autocrine mechanism, thus enhancing local host defense.\r"

It defines what can be accepted as ordinary findings, as well as two different types of skin lesions, erythematous-erosive and pseudoverrucous. Each of these is divided into two subgroups. Such a classification is a prerequisite for a meaningful comparison of the type, incidence, and severity of skin lesions in different groups; it also may allow a more reliable clinical evaluation of new ostomy appliances and skin care products. In addition, CPS may also facilitate communication among professionals who are responsible for the care of ostomy patients.\r"

A cellular blue nevus is the precursor lesion. The scalp is the most common site. The tumor often presents clinically as a progressively enlarging or multinodular blue-black lesion. The histologic pattern is fascicular dense collections of pigmented, pleomorphic spindle cells. Because of marked regional histologic variation within a malignant blue nevus, however, sampling error can cause delay in recognition of malignancy. A high clinical index of suspicion and appropriate biopsy technique are necessary to reach an early diagnosis. The most common site of metastasis of a malignant blue nevus is the lymph node. The phenomenon of benign lymph node nevus cell metastasis, which may occur with benign blue nevi, must be differentiated from a true malignant metastasis of a malignant blue nevus.\r"

The fresh-tissue technique for removing most auricular carcinomas usually permits the excision of the successive layers in 1 day, and repair, if needed, can be done immediately. The fixed-tissue technique is still used by the authors for some extensive, bone-invading carcinomas.\r"

In this study, we examined the mechanisms of vessel destruction by determining the effects of laser irradiation on three types of primary target cells in vitro: erythrocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Clinical studies were also performed, addressing the efficacy of this laser in the treatment of port-wine stains of the head and neck, trunk, and extremities. In endothelial cell cultures, both [3H]thymidine (measuring cell proliferation) and [3H]leucine (measuring protein synthesis) incorporations were inhibited at energy levels of 5-12 J/cm2 (p less than 0.01). The laser energy in the range of 5-8.5 J/cm2 had no effect on cell viability. Erythrocytes as target cells for laser energy demonstrated rapid, dose-dependent lysis. Addition of erythrocytes into a co-culture with endothelial cells abolished the direct inhibitory effect noted in cultures when endothelial cells alone were present. The results of the latter experiment imply that erythrocytes are the primary target cell absorbing the laser energy at 577 nm. However, direct laser effects on endothelial cells may also contribute to the mechanisms of ablation of the vascular ectasias by the tunable dye laser at 577 nm. Clinical trials on 28 patients with port-wine stains of the face and neck using this laser demonstrated a 75% response rate with greater than 50% lightening of the lesions. Of 9 port-wine stain lesions on the trunk and extremities (on a total of 6 patients), 8 (89%) demonstrated significant (greater than 50%) fading of their lesions. Complications such as scarring or epidermal texture changes were minimal.\r"

  ".W": "The role that diet plays in the management of plasma lipid levels is discussed in this review. It has long been recognized that saturated fatty acids and cholesterol raise the plasma cholesterol level whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids lower it. Recently, the effects of other dietary constituents in the management of plasma lipid levels have been established. In particular, monounsaturated fatty acids, soluble fiber, and vegetarian diets favorably affect plasma lipid levels. Overweight and obesity adversely affect plasma lipid levels. Omega-3 fatty acids are hypotriglyceridemic, and high carbohydrate diets low in saturated fatty acids are hypocholesterolemic. Further work is required to establish the long-term consequences of alcohol and coffee consumption on the plasma lipid response. A variety of alternative dietary strategies can be employed in conjunction with traditional dietary recommendations (i.e., reduce total fat, especially saturated fatty acids and dietary cholesterol) for the management of plasma lipid levels. The expected plasma total cholesterol (specifically low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol) reduction is approximately 10% to 20% when dietary saturated fatty acids and cholesterol are decreased to less than or equal to 7% of calories and less than or equal to 200 mg of cholesterol per day. Further dietary modifications, such as increasing soluble fiber, may lead to additional reductions of 1% to 10% in plasma total cholesterol.\r"

That the incidence of cerebral amyloid increased with aging was determined using all three approaches. Immunostaining using anti-beta protein antiserum was more sensitive than Congo red staining. The biochemical extraction was most sensitive for detection of amyloid, and revealed that amyloid was extracted initially from more than half (67%) of the brains of 9 persons in their 50s and from almost all (97%) brains of 35 persons over 60 years of age. Amyloid was extracted even from brains in which amyloid deposits were not detected by histochemical or immunohistochemical methods. This result shows early appearance of the age-related cerebral amyloid.\r"

Thus, calculation of CAGS is useful for counseling purposes and may also be useful in the design of future trials assessing therapy for Crohn's disease by allowing prerandomization stratification of patients with high or low probability of future recurrences of symptomatic disease activity.\r"

Delayed recognition and/or treatment as well as the nature of bacteria probably contributed to the tragic outcome. The findings suggest that a high index of suspicion is critical and a combined effort of the internist and ophthalmologist is mandatory.\r"

Rat gastric cells were isolated and the fractions rich (F1) and poor (F2) in parietal cells were obtained. In F1, more PGE2, PGI2 (measured as the stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha), and sulfidopeptide (SP)-LTs and less thromboxane A2 (TXA2, measured as the stable metabolite TXB2) were synthesized than in F2. AA861, an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, inhibited the synthesis of SP-LTs in both fractions in a dose-related way. AA861 alone at any concentrations used did not affect the viability of the cells, but prevented the cell damage caused by ethanol in both fractions, the effect of AA861 being inhibited by indomethacin. These results suggest that in rat stomach, PGs and LTs, except TX, are synthesized mainly in parietal cells rather than in nonparietal cells. Endogenous LT may play a crucial role in the development of cellular damage caused by ethanol independently of systemic and extracellular factors. The balance of PG and LT may be important for regulation of cellular resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a polypeptide produced in the submandibular glands, Brunner's glands, and the kidneys. The peptide is secreted in an exocrine fashion into saliva, duodenal juice, and urine. EGF stimulates cellular growth and differentiation and inhibits gastric acid secretion. Removal of the submandibular glands decreases the amount of EGF in saliva and gastric juice and subsequently the synthesis of DNA in the gastric mucosa is reduced as well as its resistance to bile-salt-induced gastric lesions. Intragastric instillation of EGF can prevent gastric ulcerations induced by aspirin as well as cysteamine in rats. EGF also accelerates the healing of chronic gastric ulcers induced by acetic acid. Cysteamine is a duodenal ulcerogen in rats. After cysteamine administration, the secretion of EGF from Brunner's glands decreases and the glands become depleted of mucus. Intraduodenal instillation of EGF can partly prevent formation of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers. Oral administration of EGF can accelerate healing of chronic duodenal ulcers in rats. The beneficial effect of EGF on healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcers is probably due to the delayed effects of EGF such as stimulation of RNA and DNA synthesis. The protective effects of EGF are probably related to the early actions of the peptide such as activation of cell surface proteins and increased glycosaminoglycan synthesis.\r"

These include (a) interference with the action of histamine-2 antagonists, (b) acceleration of gastric emptying of liquids, (c) promotion of duodenogastric reflux, (d) inhibition of pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, (e) reduction in mucosal blood flow, and (f) inhibition of mucosal prostaglandin production. Because these effects are related directly to the act of smoking and cessation of smoking is associated with the prompt recovery of the respective functions, smokers will benefit immediately by stopping or reducing cigarette consumption.\r"

Mucosal repair differs according to the severity of the damage. Repair of deep injury takes weeks because large regions of the mucosa must be replaced with new tissue, a process involving mitosis. Superficial injury is initially repaired rapidly over hours by epithelial restitution that does not involve mitosis but proceeds in the following sequence of events: First, the damaged surface epithelial cells are shed and form a layer that protects the restituting mucosa. Then the viable epithelial cells that remain attached to the mucosa at the margin of the wound become flattened and rapidly migrate over the denuded basal lamina. The superficial epithelium is re-established when migrating cells touch, form new tight junctions, and repolarize their organelles. This rapid protective mechanism, called restitution, has recently been documented in the stomach, duodenum, colon, and rectum. The cellular mechanisms, speed of migration, recovery of transmucosal electrical potential difference, and specific peculiarities of rapid epithelial restitution in the various regions of the gastrointestinal tract are reviewed here.\r"

  ".W": "A layer of water-insoluble mucus gel has been shown to form a continuous cover over the gastroduodenal mucosal surfaces, of median thickness of 180 micron in stomach in humans. This adherent mucus is the first line in mucosal defence against the natural aggressors, acid and pepsin, in the lumen. Mucus gel provides a stable unstirred layer that supports surface neutralisation of acid by mucosal bicarbonate. Mucus gel is a diffusion barrier to pepsin in the lumen, preventing proteolysis of the underlying epithelial cells. There is, however, a dynamic balance between digestion by pepsin of the mucus layer at its luminal aspect and secretion of new mucus by the epithelium. There is evidence that, in peptic ulcer disease, the rate of peptic degradation of the mucus barrier is increased. Exogenous damaging agents such as ethanol and aspirin permeate the gel matrix of the mucus barrier, rapidly damaging the underlying epithelium. The subsequent reepithelialisation process is protected by a gelatinous coat over ten times thicker than the original adherent mucus layer. This gelatinous coat is primarily a fibrin-based gel with necrotic cells and mucus.\r"

Cholinergic and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-ergic nerve fibers are distributed along the gastric microvasculature, within the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, and in the muscularis mucosae and circular muscle layer. In the mucosa, both nerve fibers evenly extend along the capillaries in association with the epithelial cells up to the mucosal surface. In particular, cholinergic nerves are proved to doubly innervate the mucosal capillaries and nonmuscular venules as well as the parietal cells. Adrenergic and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing nerves are distributed primarily along the arterioles of the gastric microvasculature, within the myenteric plexuses, and in the circular muscle layer. These nerve fibers extend up to the basal portion of the mucosa in close association with small arterioles, capillaries, and epithelial cells. Some of the adrenergic nerve axons are coexistent with the cholinergic nerve axons within the Schwann cell. Histamine H1 receptors are widely located on the walls of arterioles, capillaries and venules, while H2 receptors are evident not only on the parietal cells but also on the walls of the collecting venules and surrounding capillaries in the mucosa. Dopamine D1 receptors are predominantly located on the smooth muscle cells of the arterioles near the muscularis mucosae, while D2 receptors are present on the walls of postcapillary venules and collecting venules. Functional coordination of both intramural peptidergic nerves as intrinsic origin and aminergic nerves as extrinsic origin is considered to be essential for maintaining the gastric mucosal defense mechanism against a variety of aggressive factors.\r"

  ".U": "89035441\r", 
  ".W": "Lethally irradiated F1 mice reject bone marrow graft from H-2b parents. In a previous paper we showed that pretreatment of F1 hybrid with H-2b parental spleen cells abrogates this hybrid resistance (HR) to parental bone marrow growth by inducing a Thy-1+Lyt-1+2- nylon-adherent suppressor cell. We studied the mechanism of induction of this suppressor cell. Two hypotheses were tested; both were based on the observation that parental spleen cells when injected into a F1 hybrid, recognize the alloantigens of the opposite parent and proliferate; the proliferation of these Hh-1+ cells may result in an overload of the pretreated F1 hybrids with Hh-1 Ag, and in the development of a graft-vs-host reaction that is followed by a non-specific immunodeficiency (GVHID). Thus abrogation of HR could be due to either a tolerization with high doses of Hh-1 Ag or the GVHID. Our results show that abrogation of HR does not correlate with the GVHID because 1) it is induced after pre-treatment with H-2b parental cells only, whereas GVHID is observed after injection with cells from either of the two parents; and 2) it is induced in several conditions where GVHID does not occur; after pre-treatment with 1000-rad-irradiated or T-cell depleted or only class I incompatible spleen cells or with spleen cells from nude parents as well as after pre-treatment with H-2b bone marrow cells. HR is overcome by the injection of H-2Db homozygous or of cross-reactive H-2Ds homozygous cells only. However, although pretreatment with H-2Db homozygous spleen cells is necessary, it is not sufficient for an efficient overcoming of HR. Indeed enhancement of H-2b bone marrow growth after pre-treatment with 1000-rad-irradiated, T-cell depleted or nude parent spleen cells is very short-lasting and never reaches the level observed after pre-treatment with normal spleen cells. We conclude that inhibition of HR in F1 hybrids pretreated with parental spleen cells is not a consequence of a GVHID but of a specific tolerization with Hh-1 Ag; however, the HR is inhibited more consistently when inoculum used for the pretreatment contains fully immunocompetent T cells. The role of the immunocompetent parental T cells in abrogation of HR is discussed.\r"

The data show that the conformation of the A loop of insulin is required for recognition and that the B chain of insulin per se is not necessary for this response. Processing of native insulin was required for responses of all three T cell lines; however, each displayed a different pattern of sensitivity to inhibition of processing and aldehyde fixation of APC. A peptide comprised of two disulfide-linked A chains was partially stimulatory when presented by fixed APC whereas A chain monomers and disulfide-linked A and B chain peptides were not. The response to native insulin, peptides, and A chain dimers was sensitive to chloroquine suggesting that none of these moieties is the terminal processed peptide recognized by insulin immune T cells. The unique patterns of fine specificity, processing requirements, and recognition of aldehyde-fixed antigen-MHC for each T cell line suggest the hypothesis that Ag processing leads to heterogeneity of the T cell repertoire for a single epitope of insulin.\r"

We analyzed the H-2 specificity of the suppression expressed by the veto cells from H-2 incompatible bone marrow chimeras, because lymphocytes of such chimeras had been shown to be tolerant to both donor and recipient Ag when tested by CTL responses. We found that the bone marrow cells of such chimeras which were featured by non-T and non-B cell characteristics inhibited the generation of CTL directed against either donor or recipient Ag, but not against third-party Ag. These observations suggest that in allogeneic chimeras the veto or veto-like cells alter the inhibitory specificity exhibited in the recipient microenvironment and indicate that these cells are directly involved in the induction and maintenance of self-tolerance.\r"

In contrast, alloantigen-induced L3T4(+) Th cell function has been shown to be relatively preserved after exposure to this agent. The present studies assessed the effects of Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of donor cells on induction of lethal GVHD in other murine strain combinations. When irradiated B6 X CBAF1 mice were infused with T and NK cell-depleted B6 bone marrow cells and 3 to 30 X 10(6) B6 spleen cells, uniformly lethal GVHD was observed. However, B6 X CBAF1 recipients of T and NK-depleted B6 bone marrow cells and similar numbers of Leu-Leu-OMe-treated B6 spleen cells demonstrated 90 to 100% long term survival. In contrast, Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of B6 donor cells had no beneficial effect on mortality rates in irradiated (B6 X B6-C-H-2bm12)F1 (B6 X bm12F1) recipients. When B6 spleen cells were stimulated in vivo or in vitro with either B6 X CBAF1 or B6 X bm12F1 stimulator cells, the capacity to generate alloantigen-specific CTL was abolished comparably by Leu-Leu-OMe treatment. Thus, the dramatic difference between the effects of Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of B6 spleen cells on the course of GVHD in B6 x CBAF1 and class II MHC only disparate B6 x bm12F1 recipients could not be explained by unique resistance of bm12-specific CTL precursors to Leu-Leu-OMe. These findings indicate that T cell effector mechanisms distinct from classic cell-mediated cytotoxicity are sufficient to generate lethal GVHD in class II MHC only disparate B6----B6 X bm12F1 mice.\r"

  ".W": "Murine alveolar macrophages (AM) were shown to have proliferative ability and to form colonies in vitro. The factors in lung-conditioned medium (CM) and L929-CM which stimulate the proliferation of AM were considered to be granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and CSF-1, respectively, because recombinant murine (rm)GM-CSF and recombinant human (rh)CSF-1 could replace the activities of lung-CM and L929-CM, respectively. The phenotype of the cells in the colonies formed by AM incubated with rmGM-CSF or lung-CM was AM-like; more than 90% of the cells were stained by anti-asialo GM1 but not by FITC-LPS, and had AM-like morphology. Expression of Mac-1 Ag determined by M1/70HL in these cells as well as original AM was low. However, the phenotype of the cells in the colonies formed by AM incubated with rhCSF-1 or L929-CM was peritoneal macrophage (PM)-like; more than 90% of the cells were stained by FITC-LPS and M1/70HL, but not by anti-asialo GM1, and showed PM-like morphology. The cells in the colonies formed by AM incubated with rmGMCSF changed their phenotype after treatment with rhCSF-1; the percentage of cells stained by anti-asialo GM1 decreased, and that of cells stained by FITC-LPS increased. The cells in the colonies formed by AM incubated with rhCSF-1 never changed their phenotype after incubation with rmGM-CSF. In contrast to AM, more than 90% of the cells in all colonies formed by PM incubated with either rmGM-CSF, rhCSF-1, lung-CM, or L929-CM were stained by FITC-LPS but not by anti-asialo GM1. These results show that although AM and PM can proliferate, AM, in contrast to PM, are bipotential cells that can differentiate into two types of macrophages responding to distinct types of CSF, and that one of the molecular mechanisms controlling macrophage heterogeneity may be based on the type of CSF produced at distinct tissues.\r"

CSF-1 treatment also increased the macrophage content of the liver and peritoneal cavity and caused splenomegaly. The macrophages isolated from the peritoneum of CSF-1-treated animals were larger and expressed higher levels of the macrophage-specific F4/80 Ag. These data demonstrate that CSF-1 can act as a circulating regulator of the mononuclear phagocyte system.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have implicated sulfated polysaccharide (SP) recognition in a range of cell adhesion systems. Inasmuch as the CD2 (E rosette receptor, T11, LFA-2) molecule of human T lymphocytes is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in the adhesion of T cells to various target cells the possibility that CD2 binds SP was investigated. It was found that E rosetting of human T lymphocytes, a phenomenon involving CD2, was readily inhibited by the SP dextran sulfate (DxS) and, to a lesser extent, by the sulfated polymer polyvinyl sulfate whereas 11 other SP had no effect on E rosetting, this effect occurring at the T cell level. mAb binding studies revealed that DxS and polyvinyl sulfate, but none of the other SP tested, inhibited the binding to T cells of the anti-CD2 mAb OKT11 and anti-T112 but augmented expression of the T113 epitope of the CD2 molecule. In contrast, DxS had little or no effect on the binding of anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -Pgp-1 and WT31 (TCR alpha/beta) mAb. Direct evidence that CD2 binds DxS was demonstrated by the ability of DxS-coupled fibers to totally deplete the CD2 Ag from lysates of radiolabeled human T lymphocytes and by the quantitative recovery of the CD2 Ag in fiber eluates. Control fibers coupled with other SP bound little or no CD2. Collectively, the data indicate that the CD2 molecule specifically binds DxS and suggest that a potential target cell ligand for CD2 is a sulfated carbohydrate structure.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of iC3b receptor (CR3)-mediated phagocytosis on the expression of CR (C3b receptor, CR3) and IgG FcR (FcRI, FcRII) has been investigated by using serum-opsonized zymosan as a multivalent ligand for CR3. Sixteen hours after a short (1-h) pretreatment of human monocyte monolayers with zymosan opsonized with human AB serum (250 micrograms/ml), CR3 expression (as assessed by flow cytometric analysis with mAb Mo1) was significantly reduced by 59 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM, n = 15, p less than 0.001). Concomitant with CR3 down modulation, FcR binding activity (as assessed by binding of IgG-coated E) was also found to be decreased to 41 +/- 4% of control (n = 7, p less than 0.001). Reduced FcR function was paralleled by a decrease in the expression of FcRI (as assessed with mAb 32.2). This FcRI modulation was not caused by zymosan-bound IgG because zymosan opsonized with agammaglobulinemic serum equally down regulated CR3 and FcRI expression. Pretreatment with zymosan opsonized with human AB serum, however, did not change the expression of other IgG and C-binding sites such as FcRII (examined with mAb IV.3 and 2E1) and CR1 (assessed with mAb 57F) as well as of unrelated cell membrane structures (beta 2m, MHC class II). In contrast, co-modulation for FcR function and CR3 expression induced by polymeric IgG is accompanied by a decreased expression of FcRII. These data indicate that interaction of a specific receptor with its ligand not only changes the expression of the receptor triggered, but has also a modulating effect on other receptor systems on the same cell.\r"

  ".W": "Infection with group B streptococci (GBS) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. In the present studies, we have examined the effects of group B streptococci on C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Fresh human serum was activated to form C5a and C5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. The activated serum was then incubated with group B organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Group B organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in C-dependent chemotactic activity. The degree of inhibition was profound with 1 X 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). Experiments indicated that significant chemotactic factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to GBS organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. A number of different strains of GBS of types I, II, and III possessed inhibitory activity. In contrast, group D streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Group A streptococci that were M protein positive also inactivated C-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. The inhibitory activity of the GBS strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. C5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by RIA were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain suggesting that absorption was not involved. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that group B streptococci degrade the C5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 Da. Thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of GBS infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate C-derived inflammatory mediators. The GBS C5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group B streptococcal infection.\r"

  ".W": "Activated monocytes are an important component of immunologic defense against neoplastic disease. A variety of agents capable of inducing tumoricidal activity have been described, including bacterial LPS, IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, TNF, and GM-CSF. We now show that pretreatment of monocytes with recombinant human macrophage-specific colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) augments the tumoricidal activity of human peripheral blood monocytes induced by other activating agents. Monocytes were preincubated for three days with M-CSF at 10(3) U/ml, washed, and treated for an additional two days with secondary activators. Tumoricidal activity was measured in a 6-h 51Cr-release assay using NK-resistant WEHI 164 cells that had been treated with actinomycin D. Pretreatment of monocytes with M-CSF significantly increased tumoricidal activity induced by LPS, IFN gamma, LPS plus IFN gamma, and LPS plus PMA. Pretreatment with IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, or GM-CSF was not as effective as M-CSF in increasing tumoricidal activity. Enhanced tumoricidal activity was directly correlated to the increased TNF production resulting from M-CSF pretreatment. TNF antiserum completely blocked tumoricidal activity, demonstrating that TNF was responsible for the M-CSF-mediated increase in tumor cell lysis. M-CSF pretreatment also enhanced non-TNF mediated tumoricidal activity by monocytes, as seen by increased killing of the TNF-resistant target P815. This study demonstrated that in addition to the role of M-CSF in the proliferation and differentiation of monocyte/macrophage precursors, M-CSF also augments an effector function of mature blood monocytes.\r"

Thus, when B10.D2 spleen cells are injected into sublethally irradiated BALB/c recipient mice, in vitro splenic IFN-beta production is readily apparent between days 10 to 20 post-transplantation. In the present study, experiments were carried out to characterize the cell population(s) responsible for spontaneous IFN-beta production from GVHD spleen cells. Specific antibody and C lysis of selected cell types, including T cells, B cells, and NK cells, failed to abrogate in vitro IFN production. However, IFN-producing cells from GVHD splenocytes were nylon wool adherent and could be isolated using discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation from the upper most large cell fractions. IFN production was also partially resistant to irradiation. Using indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, IFN production was shown to be associated with MAC-1 positive cells. MAC-1 negative splenocytes demonstrated no spontaneous IFN production. Treatment of GVHD spleen cells with silica, a selective toxin for phagocytic cells, resulted in a complete inhibition of IFN production. Thus, in vitro IFN production from GVHD splenocytes appeared to come from cells having a phenotype associated with macrophages. This in vitro IFN production by macrophages represents a unique aspect of GVHD which is not typically found in tissues of normal mice.\r"

Rhu IL-4 synergized with Epo to enhance BFU-E colony formation equal to that of Epo plus either rhu IL-3, rhu GM-CSF, or rhu G-CSF. Removal of adherent cells and T lymphocytes did not influence the synergistic activities of rhu IL-4. Rmu IL-4, synergized with rhu G-CSF, but not with rmu GM-CSF, rmu IL-3, or natural mu CSF-1, to enhance CFU-GM (mainly granulocyte) colony numbers by a greater than 90% pure preparation of murine CFU-GM. Also, rhu IL-4 at low concentrations enhanced release of CSF and at higher concentrations the release also of suppressor molecules from human monocytes and PHA-stimulated human T lymphocytes. Use of specific CSF antibodies suggested that rhu IL-4 was enhancing the release of G-CSF and CSF-1 from monocytes and the release of GM-CSF and possibly G-CSF from PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes. Use of antibodies for TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, or TNF-beta as well as measurement of TNF and IFN titers suggested that the suppressor molecule(s) released from monocytes were acting with TNF-alpha and those released from PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes were acting with IFN-gamma. These results implicate B cell growth factor-1/IL-4 as a synergistic activity for hematopoietic progenitors and suggest that the actions can be on both progenitor and accessory cells.\r"

On human mononuclear cells and cell lines and platelets, MCP is a doublet. The two forms differ in Mr by approximately 5 k and the upper species is predominant in most individuals. To further characterize these two forms, limited proteolytic digestions were performed. Of the four peptides produced, three have identical Mr indicating that the molecules are similar proteins. Both forms also have acidic isoelectric points and shift to a less acidic isoelectric point after treatment with neuraminidase. Glycosidase digestions indicate that both species contain N- and O-linked oligosaccharides but that the quantity of sialic acid is greater on the larger one. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate approximately equal quantities of two precursor forms with Mr of 41 and 43 k. These two precursors possess N-linked high-mannose type of oligosaccharides and chase into the mature molecules which have complex sugars. The smaller precursor chases at a slower rate, possibly accounting for the reduced quantity of the smaller form of the mature form of MCP. These experiments indicate that the two forms of MCP are structurally similar and are derived from two distinct precursors. They also suggest that variations in the rate of processing of two intracellular precursors may account for the different quantities of the mature forms of this membrane protein.\r"

These results indicate that transgenic mice express a functional HLA-B27 gene product on cell surfaces in the absence of the human beta 2-microglobulin gene.

Sendai virus has also been reported to induce TNF from macrophages. We report here that an opportunistic fungi, Candida albicans, can also induce TNF, not only from human monocytes, but also from Percoll-fractionated large granular lymphocytes (LGL) which mediate NK function. Incubation of monocytes of LGL with C. albicans for 8 h was sufficient for detection of TNF release and peak induction was observed at 24 h. Induction of TNF from LGL did not require the participation of monocytes or T cells because treatment of the LGL with CD14 or CD15 to eliminate contaminating monocytes and CD3, CD4, or CD8 to eliminate contaminating T cells did not decrease the level of TNF produced from the treated LGL. Small T cells recovered from the denser fractions of the Percoll gradient had no ability to produce TNF, even when 10% monocytes were added to the T cells to provide accessory function. The phenotype of the TNF-producing LGL was CD2+, CD11+, CD16+, NKH1+, LEU7-. The TNF produced by both monocytes and LGL was neutralized by specific monoclonal and polyclonal anti-TNF but not by monoclonal antilymphotoxin. These results indicate that TNF production is a normal response of monocytes and LGL to stimulation by fungi such as C. albicans and that the release of TNF may be related to its ability to activate effector function to control Candida growth, which we have shown earlier for neutrophils with TNF.\r"

In 23 of 24 patients, a dramatic increase in the total number of cells actively secreting immunoglobulins was detected one week after onset of diarrhea, and most of the cells were secreting IgA. Cells secreting antibody specific to the pathogen (Campylobacter jejuni or Salmonella spp.) also appeared at this time but accounted for only a part of the total response. The data suggest that diarrhea induces a vigorous, apparently polyclonal response, including antibodies to normal intestinal flora. The response to the infective agent was outstanding and suggests that this method can be used to identify the causative agent of an infection.\r"

These atypical oocysts were shown by electron microscopy to have a distinctive three-layered outer coat and, by immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antiserum, to lack an antigen present on the surface of typical oocysts. In contrast to typical oocysts, the atypical variety is very fragile and quickly collapses when suspended in solutions of high osmotic pressure or in lipid solvents. Atypical oocysts cannot be stained by methods used to stain typical oocysts, but their appearance in sucrose-phenol is characteristic. Their stability in this solution, though much less than that of typical oocysts, is sufficient for them to be recognized and for cases to be diagnosed by microscopy. Patients who excreted atypical oocysts never excreted the typical variety. General findings in patients who excreted atypical oocysts were no different from those who excreted typical oocysts.\r"

The mean minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of amphotericin B was 3.3 micrograms/mL and of miconazole, 5.3 micrograms/mL; all isolates were resistant to 5-fluorocytosine. All patients received amphotericin B (1.0-1.5 mg/kg per d) plus 5-fluorocytosine. In contrast to results found in the literature, five patients had resolution of their infections, and the one patient who died had necropsy evidence of disseminated fusariosis. Review of our cases and of the literature did not reveal a definitive source for the organism or its portal of entry. Fusarium spp. must be recognized as opportunistic pathogens that cause a potentially fatal infection in compromised patients.\r"

We measured in vitro T cell responses to Cryptococcus neoformans and tetanus toxoid, response to mitogens, HIV p24 antigenemia, and clinical parameters. Progression to AIDS was significantly associated with loss of T cell response to cryptococci (P = .015), HIV antigenemia (P = .001), and low CD4+ cell numbers (P = .001). Most importantly, we found that loss of antigen-specific responses to cryptococci and tetanus can occur before changes in CD4 cell number. Abnormal response to mitogens and marked depletion of CD4+ cells were late signs of progressive HIV infection. Measurement of antigen-specific T cell function may be useful for assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapy in HIV infection before onset of symptoms.\r"

Eighty-nine patients applied the gel three times a day for four weeks and were studied for at least 16 w. Side effects were generally mild and limited to the site of application for all three drugs. Although a transient, statistically significant therapeutic effect was noted early in the course of treatment with both interferon gels as compared with placebo, this effect was lost by the end of the follow-up period, possibly because of a generally high response rate in patients receiving placebo. Hence, there was no overall difference in the number of patients with a partial or complete response to any of the agents by the end of therapy or by the end of the study.\r"

Immunoblotting techniques revealed that complexes isolated from the sera of the infected infants contained endogenous host antigens, as well as a limited number of treponemal polypeptides. Consistent with earlier findings examining purified immune complexes from adults with secondary syphilis and from infected animals, an 83-kilodalton Treponema pallidum antigen was present in all of the isolated complexes from infants with congenital syphilis. Our findings emphasize the fact that current serological and clinical measures of infection are inadequate and that certain \"at risk\" infants should be treated despite normal cerebrospinal findings and the absence of clinical manifestations.\r"

Analysis of hot-acid extracts by immunoelectrophoresis confirmed that two of these reactivities corresponded to the reported alpha and beta antigens of the c-protein marker. In addition, the identification of two heretofore unidentified antigens, gamma and delta, by the two-stage RIA is detailed in this report. The assay uses intact bacteria and does not require hot-acid extraction, a procedure thus enabling detection of acid-labile antigens in their native unmodified form. The semiquantitative RIA requires less typing reagent than does precipitin testing and is more objective, reproducible, and rapid. The assay described here could be applied to the detection of any cell surface antigen for which a monospecific antiserum is available.\r"

In contrast, aerobactin production was significantly associated with PN compared with lower UTI in both sexes.

Eight healthy young women underwent a maximal bicycle ergometer exercise test with prior in vivo administration of a placebo and an opioid antagonist, naloxone (100 micrograms/kg), in a randomized, blind protocol. Exercise after the placebo injection was accompanied by a dramatic rise in NK activity, as well as an increase in the percentage of lymphocytes bearing the NK cell surface markers Leu 11a and Leu 19. Significant stimulation of NK activity was observed with beta-endorphin in vitro before exercise, but after exercise, beta-endorphin had a nonsignificant inhibitory effect. When these experiments were carried out in the presence of naloxone in vivo, the rise in NK activity after exercise was no longer significant. Naloxone did not significantly alter the rise in Leu 11a+ or Leu 19+ cell after exercise, as compared with the placebo. Finally, when naloxone was given to the subjects beforehand, exercise no longer completely blocked the in vitro beta-endorphin stimulation of NK cells. In conclusion, our observations that the exercise-induced augmentation of NK activity and the lack of effect of beta-endorphin in vitro on NK activity after exercise are both significantly attenuated by prior administration of naloxone suggest that the opioid system may play a major role in the modulation of NK cells during physiologic stress.\r"

Both IGF-I and IGF-II levels decreased as liver disease progressed from the normal control stage to chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and both levels reflected the severity of liver disease. Patients with HCCs who had hypoglycemia had relatively higher IGF-II levels in their sera in comparison with those who did not have hypoglycemia (272 +/- 167.5 ng/ml vs 110.4 +/- 85.9 ng/ml [mean +/- SD], p less than 0.0005), despite the fact that those with hypoglycemia had more advanced liver cancer and had lower IGF-I levels in sera (16.7 +/- 14.1 ng/ml vs 46.8 +/- 47.9 ng/ml, p less than 0.002). It is possible that a labile IGF-II material is produced by the cancer cells of patients with hypoglycemia. This factor is reactive to the IGF-II receptor and partially cross-reacts with an antibody to IGF-II; it accounted for the mildly elevated levels of serum IGF-II. Hypoglycemia may be an integral effect of relatively elevated IGF-II like material and an advanced liver cancer. Also, higher serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were more frequently found in patients with hypoglycemia who had relatively elevated IGF-II levels and short survivals.\r"

We studied the ability of bovine insulin, porcine insulin, and human insulin ICs to stimulate the procoagulant activity (PCA) of human blood monocytes (HBMs) and human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVE) in vitro. Polyclonal insulin antibodies from patients with insulin antibody-mediated resistance were isolated by immunoabsorption. PCA expressed by isolated adherent HBMs or cultured HUVE was quantified by radioimmunoassay of fibrinopeptide A with a 1:80 dilution of human plasma. Beef, pork, and human insulin, in quantities determined from titration curves, were added to fixed amounts of antibody to obtain equivalent amounts of ICs. For four different antibodies, the ratios of PCA (expressed by HBMs exposed to ICs or to antibodies alone and normalized for cell numbers) to activity expressed by tissue culture medium were as follows: beef insulin ICs, 2.55 +/- 0.41; por insulin ICs, 1.47 +/- 0.16; human insulin ICs, 1.28 +/- 0.19; and antibody, 1.28 +/- 0.32. The differences between beef and pork insulin ICs and antibody controls were significant. For a fifth antibody, a dose response between beef insulin ICs and PCA expression was demonstrated. For a sixth antibody, HBMs could express PCA when stimulated with antibody of a relatively low binding capacity (0.35 ng bovine insulin per microgram of antibody) only in the presence of lymphocytes. Conditioned medium from these cells significantly stimulated endothelial cell procoagulant activity. These observations raise the possibility that insulin ICs, that is, beef insulin ICs, may generate increased PCA and thereby contribute to the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

But although the connotation of the former was clear, the latter had no positive diagnostic features, with the result that it fell very largely out of use. This paper presents evidence that there are depressions that are a consequence of neurotic anxiety. They can be positively diagnosed, and are resolved by overcoming the underlying neurotic anxieties. The neurotic basis of many cases of depression explains the success of different psychotherapeutic strategies in alleviating nonpsychotic depression, since 50% of neurotic cases respond to the nonspecific impact of the therapeutic interview. Unfortunately, the various outcome studies are muddied by failure to realize that a variety of psychopathologies are represented in nonpsychotic depression.\r"

  ".W": "Use of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is increasing, and it is being promoted as a less expensive alternative to center hemodialysis (CHD). The debate over the relative charges for CAPD and CHD cannot generally be answered without considering the relationship between modality selection and patient characteristics. When selection and patient characteristics are accounted for, the difference between annual charges for CAPD and CHD patients is insignificant, in part because of the current payment system. The analysis suggests that patients using CHD may have lower charges than if they were using CAPD; similarly, patients using CAPD may have lower charges than if they were using CHD. Charges during CAPD training are lower than CHD or CAPD charges. Charges during the transition between CHD and CAPD tend to be higher than either CHD or CAPD due to additional hospitalizations. Estimated results suggest that encouraging current CHD patients to transfer to CAPD (or vice versa) may not have the desired effect of reducing charges.\r"

  ".W": "A statistical decision-making system has been developed which will predict the clinical status of a patient with cystic fibrosis based on daily self measurements obtained at home. The data for the study were collected from CF patients within 7-12 years of age. Thirty-two participants recorded four daily measurements (weight, vital capacity, breathing rate, and resting pulse) and one weekly measurement (height). In addition to the 4 daily measured values, the clinical status of each patient at his/her most recent previous clinic visit was used as a predictor variable. The measured values were used as the basis for the development of a discriminant rule. The goal of the rule was to determine whether each patient's clinical status was deteriorating, stable, or improving at the time of the most recent set of weekly measurements. Three types of analysis were performed: linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and nearest neighbor. Quadratic discriminant analysis provided the best discrimination due to the differences in the covariance matrices among the populations. The rule was able to correctly classify 77% of the 103 cases in the learning set. To further evaluate the rule, both a weighted classification percentage and weighted kappa statistic were calculated for the rule. Bootstrapping was used to predict the performance of the rule on the population with results of 77% correctly classified overall.\r"

Under certain conditions, it is possible to estimate error parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, relative risk, or predictive value, even though no definitive classification (gold standard) is available. The parameter estimates are obtained by modelling the data, using maximum likelihood, with or without some constraints. The models recognize that the true classification of an individual is unknown, and so are sometimes referred to as \"latent class\" models. The latent class approach provides a unified framework for various methods found in a dispersed literature, characterising each by the number of populations or subgroups in the data, and the number of observations made on each individual; the statistical degrees of freedom are implied by the sampling design. Data sets with less than three replicate observations per individual necessarily require constraints for parameter estimation to be possible. Data sets with three or more replicates lead directly to estimates of the misclassification rates, subject to some simple assumptions. Some more complex problems are also discussed, including data where the response variable has more than two levels, sequential and irregular designs and the effects of assumption violations.\r"

The randomization between vincristine (VCR) plus dactinomycin (AMD) and the same two drugs plus doxorubicin (ADR) had a minimal effect on RT toxicity. Five (1.6%) fatalities were recorded and the surviving 18 patients recovered without discernible residua. Sixteen patients had hepatic, four had pulmonary, and three had cardiac toxicity. Hepatic toxicity was significantly more common when the right side of the abdomen or the whole abdomen was irradiated than when the left side was treated (P = .01). We conclude that acute RT-related toxicity in NWTS-2 was very similar to that in NWTS-1, in which 26 (7.2%) of 359 randomized patients developed RT-related toxicity and three died. This acceptable rate was maintained despite more intensive chemotherapy (CT) in NWTS-2.\r"

A precodified form was sent to 55 European institutes in order to evaluate the incidence of NHL in the elderly with regard to natural history, treatment-related toxicity, response, and survival. Thirteen institutes participated in the study. One hundred thirty-seven cases of NHL were observed in the elderly during 1984, making up 28% of the total number of NHL seen in those institutes. The median age was 77 years; 21% of the patients had favorable (low-grade) and 73% unfavorable (intermediate- and high-grade) histology, according to the Working Formulation. Stage at presentation was localized (I and II) in 60% and advanced in 37% of the patients. Most of the physicians used standard therapy regimens at reduced doses, from the beginning of the treatment. Sixty patients (44%) underwent a \"conservative\" treatment (one or two antineoplastic drugs or local field radiotherapy) and 77 (56%) an \"aggressive\" treatment (polychemotherapy regimens or extended field radiotherapy). Response was similar between the two treatment groups, but severe and lethal toxicity was significantly higher among patients treated with aggressive therapy. Prospective randomized studies are clearly needed to define the optimal treatment in elderly patients with advanced unfavorable NHL.\r"

The dose used was 2 x 10(6) U/m2 self-administered subcutaneously three times weekly, for a planned treatment duration of 12 to 18 months. Of the 68 evaluable patients, the major response rate was 75%, with 13% complete responses (CRs) and 62% partial responses (PRs). An additional eleven patients (16%) had minor responses (MRs). Duration of response was denoted as failure-free survival (FFS), defined as the time from the end of IFN therapy to a need for further antileukemic therapy. Of the 60 responding patients followed after discontinuation of IFN, 27 have relapsed, requiring further therapy. The median actuarial FFS for these 60 patients is 25.4 months. All but five patients are alive, and the actuarial overall survival for the 69 patients is 91% +/- 4% at 4 years from the start of IFN. The best indicators of relapse were the neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score and degree of residual bone marrow hairy cells (%HCL) at the completion of therapy. Patients with NAP less than 30 (n = 21) had the best prognosis (median FFS, 30.4 months), while those with NAP greater than or equal to 30 and %HCL less than or equal to 30 (n = 21) or %HCL greater than 30 (n = 16) had intermediate and poor prognoses, respectively (median FFS, 23.5 and 12.4 months) (P = .0005). Fourteen of the relapsing patients are evaluable for response to a second course of IFN, with seven PRs and four MRs. Stratified randomized trials are indicated to determine the role of maintenance therapy for responding patients.\r"

In each scenario, the surgeon or physician was asked to consider himself as a patient with bladder, prostate, or kidney cancer, and to select his own treatment. Accompanying each scenario were one or two clinical trials for which the physician would be eligible. He was asked to state if he would agree to be randomized in each trial, and if he refused, to state his reasons. We found that (1) there were major differences of opinion about management for each scenario; (2) choice of treatment was influenced more by specialty training or geographic location than by the results of previous clinical trials (which are available to all); (3) British urologists tended to be less aggressive than their North American colleagues, with respect to the use of radical surgery and chemotherapy; (4) acceptance of clinical trials ranged from 3% to 60%; and (5) agreement to clinical trials was quite poor even when they were designed to compare the most popular options for management. This physician surrogate method is a valuable tool in assessment of the degree of consensus amongst expert physicians and in the determination of whether new clinical trials address important areas of controversy.\r"

  ".W": "Melphalan (L-phenylalanine mustard) is a bifunctional alkylating agent that is commonly administered orally to treat a wide variety of malignancies, including cancers of the breast and ovary, as well as multiple myeloma. Although commercially available in Europe and Canada, intravenous (IV) melphalan remains investigational in the United States. The role of IV melphalan in cancer chemotherapy is not well defined, despite its manageable toxicity and higher and more predictable blood levels following IV administration compared with oral administration. In addition, unlike oral melphalan, an extensive phase I evaluation of IV melphalan has not been undertaken. At lower doses (eg, 30 to 70 mg/m2), both as a single agent and in combination, the activity of IV melphalan has been evaluated in only a limited number of diseases. However, striking activity has been observed in previously untreated patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, a disease not generally considered responsive to alkylating agents. When administered at high doses (greater than 140 mg/m2) requiring bone marrow reinfusion, melphalan effects a high response rate (but no improvement in survival) in a variety of nonhematologic tumor types, including resistant tumors such as melanoma and colon carcinoma. In contrast, in poor-prognosis patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, or neuroblastoma, high-dose melphalan-containing regimens have yielded both high response rates and improved survival, despite considerable toxicity. Additional clinical trials will be necessary to define the spectrum of activity of lower doses of IV melphalan and to define subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from high-dose melphalan.\r"

Of the 213 patients enrolled in the study, 58 underwent early surgery (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 69 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 74 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Eleven patients died before surgery was undertaken and one was not scheduled for operation. Administration of the drug was started immediately after the radiological diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm had been made. The dose of nimodipine or matching placebo was 0.5 micrograms/kg/min via continuous intravenous infusion for 7 to 10 days after the SAH and, if the patient was operated on late, for 2 to 3 days after the operation as well. After intravenous treatment, oral administration of nimodipine or placebo was continued for up to 21 days after SAH in a dose of 60 mg every 4 hours. Nimodipine treatment was associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate (p = 0.03) in the early and subacute surgery groups. In the total series the number of deaths due to delayed ischemic deterioration was significantly lower in the nimodipine group than in the placebo group (p = 0.01).\r"

  ".W": "One hundred sixty-six papers published in seven neurosurgical journals from 1983 through 1985 have been surveyed to determine the methods used for assessment of overall patient responsiveness in acute cerebral disorders (coma grading). Fifty-one different coma scales or modifications were found. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) sum score (that is, the sum of the scores of the individual eye, verbal, and motor scales) dominated (54%), and was used in 73 (76%) of 96 of the head-injury studies; in 56 (77%) of these 73 studies it was the single method of grading neurological status. The GCS sum score was used in 16 (23%) of 70 studies in patients with other etiologies. The Hunt and Hess scale was used in 26 (57%) of 46 reports of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 31 (55%) of the 56 studies of head injuries using the GCS alone, it was not obvious if the 12- or 13-grade scale was used. In 13 studies (23%) no reference to methodological investigations was made. In 44 papers (79%) the handling of untestable features, such as intubation or swollen eyes, was not reported. In the 56 studies using the GCS alone, coma was defined in many different ways and in 22 studies the definition of coma was not specified. In 63% of reports, the GCS sum score scale was combined in one to five groups of scores and this was done in 32 different ways. No information was available to describe the procedure of data aggregation or the reliability of the 13-grade GCS sum score. The lack of standardization makes it unnecessarily difficult to perform valid comparisons between different series of patients. Since the GCS sum score is the most widely used scale, it is suggested that the reporting of the GCS sum score should be standardized regarding pseudoscoring, coma definition, and use of combined scores. Further studies on the reliability of the GCS sum score are needed.\r"

  ".W": "The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the Reaction Level Scale (RLS85) were compared for rating neurosurgical patients in regard to ranking order of deficit severity, interobserver variability, and coverage for relevant factors. Four physicians, four registered nurses, and four assistant nurses performed 72 pairwise ratings on 47 neurosurgical patients. The rank correlation between the GCS sum score and the RLS85 was -0.94, suggesting the same ranking order of severity and indicating that the underlying concepts of somnolence, delirium, and motor responses in coma are evaluated in the same way. By the sign test, the RLS85 was shown to have better interobserver agreement than the GCS sum score and the eye-motor-verbal (EMV) profile. The interobserver grading disagreements in both scales were distributed over the entire range of responsiveness, and for the GCS sum score they were slanted to combined segments 9 to 15. The RLS85 showed full coverage of relevant factors, while 43 (60%) of the 72 test occasions in the GCS sum score and the EMV profiles showed untestable features, most often because of patient intubation. The pseudoscore (that is, the choice of value given to untestable features) affects interobserver agreement as well as the estimated overall patient responsiveness in the GCS sum score. Assessment by the order of applying the scales showed a significant effect on the GCS eye-opening scale (p = 0.01) and the GCS sum score (p = 0.03), indicating a sensitivity to environmental stimuli unrelated to the patient's status. This study demonstrates that basically the same information as that found in the separate eye, motor, and verbal scales of the GCS can be combined directly into the RLS85, which has better interobserver agreement and better coverage than the GCS sum score.\r"

  ".W": "The present investigation was conducted in order to examine the feasibility of isolating and growing glioma-infiltrating lymphocytes in vitro as possible effector cells for use in new adoptive immunotherapy. Eight surgical specimens obtained from patients with malignant astrocytomas were treated by enzyme dispersion; the cells were separated on a density gradient and grown in the presence of human recombinant interleukin-2. The cultured lymphocytes were tested for cell-surface markers by using monoclonal antibodies in a flow cytometric analysis. In all cases the glioma-derived lymphocytes were grown in culture for several weeks with substantial increases in cell numbers (at least 5 X 10(8) cells). The mature T cell population (CD3, 89%) was found to have an increased proportion of the cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype CD8 (55%) as compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL's). Eighty-six percent of the cultivated lymphocytes expressed HLA-DR. The IL-2 receptor was predominantly expressed on the helper subset (CD4-positive). Otherwise, anti-CD16, which specifically reacts with natural killer (NK) cells, did not stain significantly more of the cultured gliomaderived lymphocytes compared with lymphocyte-activated PBL's. These results corroborate the observations made with conventional immunohistochemical examination. It has been demonstrated that T lymphocytes isolated from human cancers are enriched for specific reactivity to their autochthonous tumor cells. These experiments support the possible use of glioma-infiltrating lymphocytes as a new treatment for patients with malignant glioma.\r"

Forty examinations were performed in liver grafts and 13 in normal subjects. The PC was significantly higher in normal native liver (64.0 +/- 3.0%) than in functioning grafts (58.8 +/- 3.1%). In acutely rejecting patients, PC was significantly lower (52.4 +/- 2.0%) than in functioning grafts and similar to that observed in cholangitis (53.5 +/- 0.7%). The PC increases again once rejection has resolved (57.3 +/- 2.6%). During hepatitis post-transplant PC values (59.7 +/- 3.4%) were similar to those observed in functioning grafts. Overall, PC values over 55% are very unlikely to be due to rejection.\r"

Research to date indicates that taurine plays an important role in the development of the nervous system and the process of migration in particular. It is speculated that taurine uptake and release, in conjunction with glutamate uptake and release, may represent one form of communication between neurons and glial cells. The need of taurine by the body is emphasized by the ability of the kidney to curtail taurine excretion to conserve taurine in the face of a low dietary taurine intake. The evidence for a special role of taurine in development is considered and discussed.\r"

Rats were fed diets containing 1.5, 12.6 or 50.3 mg Zn/kg for 19 d (dietary period I). Total body Zn in the three groups was 1870 +/- 340, 3953 +/- 698 and 4126 +/- 844 micrograms Zn/rat. Each group was divided into four subgroups fed 3.6, 12.6, 20.5 or 50.3 mg Zn/kg diet for 3 wk (dietary period II). Rats were injected intramuscularly with 65Zn after 7 d of dietary period II. True absorption and endogenous excretion were calculated by isotope dilution. Zinc intake, urinary and fecal excretion, balance and percent Zn absorption were significantly affected only by dietary Zn in dietary period II (P less than 0.01). Endogenous excretion was affected by both past dietary Zn deficiency (body Zn stores) and by dietary Zn in dietary period II (P = 0.0001). Total body Zn at the end of the experiment was significantly affected by both periods of dietary treatment (P less than 0.001), but total body Zn concentration was affected only by the final dietary treatment (P less than 0.05). These results show that Zn absorption is affected by the current diet, but that turnover of Zn (endogenous excretion) is regulated by both current Zn intake and past Zn intake, probably through an effect on body Zn stores.\r"

The protein-depleted rats had a low body weight and lower plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentrations compared with the 14.4% protein pair-fed control animals. The rate of appearance of glucose in plasma in the protein-depleted rats was significantly less than that in the pair-fed controls. During an intravenous infusion of unlabeled glucose (38.8 mumol.kg-1.min-1) plasma glucose concentrations and glucose appearance increased in both groups. Plasma insulin concentration remained lower in the 4% protein-fed group though the percentage of increase above basal was similar in both groups during glucose infusion. The clearance of glucose from the blood and suppression of endogenous glucose production during the exogenous glucose infusion were similar in both control and protein-depleted rats. Rats fed a 14.4% protein diet ad libitum consumed more diet than the pair-fed groups and their body weights were greater. However, fasting plasma glucose and insulin, concentrations were similar to the 14.4% protein pair-fed animals. This indicates that the observed changes in glucose metabolism in the 4% protein-fed animals were due to a reduced dietary ratio of protein to carbohydrate rather than reduced energy intake.\r"

Renal evaluation findings were considered abnormal if there was oliguria (urine output less than 1 ml/kg/hr), which was designated transient if present in the first 24 hours only and persistent if present for at least 36 hours, or if the urinary beta 2-microglobulin concentration from first-void urine was elevated: (1) Thirteen infants had persistent oliguria; the urinary beta 2-microglobulin level was elevated in all. The six term infants had clinical signs consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); all six had ultrasonographic abnormalities. The outcome was poor (i.e., death or long-term neurologic deficits) in five of six infants. The seven preterm infants with persistent oliguria had clinical evidence of HIE, and three infants had intraventricular hemorrhage; all seven infants died. (2) Fifteen infants had transient oliguria (beta 2-microglobulin level was elevated in eight infants). Two of the eight term infants had evidence for HIE; the cranial ultrasound scan was normal in all. At follow-up, seven term infants are normal and one is abnormal. Six of the seven preterm infants with transient oliguria had clinical evidence of HIE; three infants had intraventricular hemorrhage. Three infants died, and the four survivors are normal at follow-up. (3) Ninety-two infants had normal urine output. Of the 22 term infants, two developed signs of HIE, and the ultrasound scan was abnormal in three infants. Of the 70 preterm infants, eight (11%) had clinical signs consistent with HIE, the ultrasound scan was abnormal in 20 of 64 (31%) infants scanned, and 14 (20%) infants died. Most of the followed infants are normal. Thus oliguria was significantly associated with clinical signs of HIE, including seizures, death (specifically in the premature infant), and long-term neurologic deficits. These data suggest that oliguria in the perinatal period is a sensitive indicator of infants at risk for long-term neurologic deficits.\r"

All patients entered into the study had illness of less than 72 hours' duration and no prior allopathic drug therapy. Treatment was randomized and administered in double-blind fashion. Patients initially treated with ampicillin who were infected with a Shigella strain resistant to ampicillin were considered as a separate group (ampicillin-R). All isolates were susceptible to nalidixic acid. Similar percentages of patients treated with nalidixic acid (26/32, 81%) and with ampicillin (17/22, 77%) were clinically cured by the end of therapy; the rate in ampicillin-R (3/14, 21%) patients was significantly lower (p less than 0.001). Stool frequency in patients treated with nalidixic acid was significantly less than for ampicillin-treated or ampicillin-R patients during the final 3 study days. All patients treated with nalidixic acid and ampicillin had Shigella eradicated from their stool by day 3, compared with 77% (10/13) of ampicillin-R patients (p less than 0.05, ampicillin-R vs nalidixic acid or ampicillin). We conclude that nalidixic acid is an effective alternative to ampicillin in the treatment of shigellosis caused by nalidixic acid-susceptible strains.\r"

However, pretreatment of rats with beta-FNA attenuates the ability of delta antagonists and naloxone to reverse delta receptor-mediated physiological effects, suggesting that physically adjacent mu and delta receptors interact in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine which opiate receptor subtype is altered by i.c.v. injections of beta-FNA, as well as by in vitro incubations with beta-FNA, and then to examine the hypothesis that pretreatment of rats with beta-FNA increases the IC50 for naloxone at the altered binding site. The results demonstrate that beta-FNA alters the conformation of the opiate receptor complex, as evidenced by a decrease in the Bmax of the lower affinity [3H]D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin binding site and a doubling of the naloxone IC50 for displacing [3H]D-Ala3-D-Leu5-enkephalin from this site. [3H]D-Ala2-MePhe4,Gly-ol5-enkephalin binding sites were not detectably altered by i.c.v. injections of beta-FNA. These data collectively support the concept of coupling among opioid receptor subtypes.\r"

  ".W": "Nitrofurantoin is an antimicrobial agent that causes nonimmune hemolytic anemia in susceptible populations and produces oxidant stress and cellular damage by mechanisms that differ from those associated with oxidants such as phenylhydrazine, which has been shown to stimulate proteolysis in red cells (Goldberg and Boches, 1982). Thus a study of the effects of nitrofurantoin on proteolysis in normal human red cells and red cell hemolysate has been conducted. Nitrofurantoin produced greater than a 3- and an approximately 5-fold increase in the rate of tyrosine release from red cells at 100 and 800 microM, respectively, compared with untreated red cells. In hemolysates nitrofurantoin also effectively increased proteolysis with a 2.4- and 4.0-fold increase in the rate of tyrosine release monitored at 100 and 800 microM, respectively, relative to controls. Stimulation of proteolysis by nitrofurantoin occurred linearly with time and with hematocrit over the range 5-25%. The rate of nitrofurantoin-stimulated proteolysis varied with glucose concentration in the incubation medium with a 2-fold increase in activity monitored between 2 and 10 mM glucose. Inhibitors of flavoprotein activity (electron transport), such as 2'-AMP and NADP, decreased nitrofurantoin-enhanced proteolysis in red cells to control levels, whereas methylene blue provided only a slight increase in proteolysis and an anaerobic environment (N2) stimulated significantly the rate of tyrosine production. Although N-acetylcysteine protected against the stimulation of proteolysis produced by 10 microM nitrofurantoin, this protective effect was diminished at higher concentrations of drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, including CGS 19755, have the ability to antagonize NMDA-induced convulsions, to cause ataxia and, at high doses, to increase spontaneous locomotor activity. It was of interest to determine whether or not repeated treatment with CGS 19755 would induce tolerance to some or all of these effects. CGS 19755 was administered to mice twice daily for 14 days at 54 mg/kg i.p. per injection. One day after the last repeated injection, mice were challenged with vehicle or one of several doses of CGS 19755 (10, 30, 54 and 100 mg/kg) and were tested for evidence of motor impairment (using righting reflex and traction tests), for spontaneous locomotor activity and for the threshold dose of NMDA required to induce convulsions. When challenged with CGS 19755, mice that had previously received only vehicle showed reduced motor activity in response to doses of 54 and 100 mg/kg. In contrast, mice that had received the repeated treatment regimen of CGS 19755 increased motor activity in response to challenge doses of 30 and 54 mg/kg. These effects resembled those reported previously by some investigators for phencyclidine. However, repeated treatment with CGS 19755 induced only slight tolerance to the ability of this drug to cause ataxia. In mice treated repeatedly with CGS 19755, the threshold dose of NMDA to induce convulsions did not differ significantly from that in mice treated repeatedly with vehicle, indicating no demonstrable tolerance to the apparent anticonvulsant effects of CGS 19755 over this time period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The stimulation of cAMP PDE occurs within 5 to 10 min of the introduction of insulin. When cyclic GMP or high concentrations of cAMP (greater than 5 microM) are used as substrate, insulin does not increase PDE activity. Although the insulin-increased cAMP PDE exhibits the same sensitivity as control PDE from untreated preparations to isobutylmethyl xanthine, a nonspecific PDE inhibitor, and M & B 22,948, a relatively selective cyclic GMP PDE inhibitor, differences in the degree of inhibition of PDE activity are seen in the insulin-treated and untreated preparations with the low Km cAMP PDE inhibitors Ro20-1724, rolipram, amrinone and milrinone and with cyclic GMP. Pertussis toxin, which modifies GTP regulatory proteins of the adenylate cyclase enzyme and the photoreceptor PDE, blocks cAMP PDE activation by insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The neurochemical basis for the supersensitivity to mu or kappa opiate agonists observed after chronic naloxone infusion (reported in the preceding paper) has been investigated using the technique of quantitative in vitro autoradiography. The binding of [3H]-D-Ala2MePhe4Glyol enkephalin (3H-DAGO) to mu opioid sites was increased in many brain regions after chronic administration (7 days) of a low dose of naloxone (0.5 mg/kg/hr). The greatest increases were seen in the hippocampal strata moleculare and lucidum. The binding of [3H]-D-Ala2-D-Leu5 enkephalin (3H-DADL) to delta sites and of [3H]-bremazocine to kappa sites were not significantly affected in any region. In contrast, after administration of a higher dose of naloxone (3.0 mg/kg/hr), the binding to mu, delta and kappa sites was increased in many brain areas, suggesting that up-regulation is observed only when a sufficient proportion of the receptors in vivo are occupied by the antagonist. However, a different regional pattern of up-regulation was seen for each class of opiate binding site. The greatest increases in kappa binding in the brain were seen in the periaqueductal gray and the hippocampal molecular and pyramidal cell layers. The substantia nigra showed up-regulation of kappa but not of mu sites. Differences in the pattern of mu and kappa binding site up-regulation were also noted in the spinal cord. This regionally specific modulation of opiate binding sites suggests that, for each receptor type, the level of tonic activation varies between individual brain areas. In addition, the data demonstrate that all three types of opiate receptor can undergo up-regulation \"in vivo.\"\r"

  ".W": "The destruction of joints in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is thought to be related in part to an increased synthesis of proteolytic enzymes. We have determined neutral collagenolytic protease activity levels in human RA synovia and articular cartilage and examined the in vivo effects of various therapeutic regimens on enzyme levels. Neutral metallocollagenolytic enzyme (NMCE) was measured in 29 RA cartilages and synovial membranes. In addition, synovial serine protease levels were determined. Specimens were divided into 4 groups according to prescribed medications: (1) nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs alone; (2) steroids alone; (3) steroids and gold; and (4) steroids and methotrexate (MTX). Ten normal specimens were used as controls. Total and active NMCE measured in both RA cartilage and synovial membrane specimens showed a significantly higher level of activity than in controls (p less than 0.0001, p less than 0.005; p less than 0.004, p less than 0.02). MTX was found to markedly decrease NMCE activity; cartilage NMCE level in patients with RA receiving MTX was reduced, compared to the other subgroups. This was particularly noted for the active form. Synovial NMCE levels from the MTX subgroup for both enzyme forms were much lower than in any other RA subgroup, significantly lower than in the RA group as a whole (p less than 0.05), and similar to controls. RA synovial membrane serine protease activity showed an increase compared to controls. Again, MTX markedly decreased the activity of this class of enzyme. Our data strongly support the role of neutral proteases in the destruction of RA joints. MTX was the only drug to consistently decrease these enzyme levels in joint tissues.\r"

After single blind, placebo washout periods of 2 days to 2 weeks, patients entered 12-week treatment periods in each study. In both studies, diclofenac, aspirin, and naproxen produced statistically significant improvement (p less than or equal to 0.01) from baseline in all primary efficacy variables at each assessment visit. There were no significant differences between treatments. In both studies, significantly fewer (p less than or equal to 0.05) patients receiving diclofenac experienced adverse effects compared to the aspirin and naproxen groups. Significantly fewer (p less than 0.05) patients in the diclofenac group compared to the aspirin group discontinued the trial due to side effects (primarily tinnitus and deafness). In Study 2, fewer patients in the diclofenac group discontinued the trial due to adverse effects than in the naproxen group. In conclusion, diclofenac, aspirin, and naproxen demonstrated similar efficacy; however, diclofenac was significantly better tolerated than either aspirin or naproxen.\r"

We demonstrated a global lymphocytosis with marked expansion of the B cell subset. Despite an increase in B cell numbers, there was a decrease in in vitro immunoglobulin production in response to pokeweed mitogen and hydrocortisone stimulation. These abnormalities correlated with a marked increase in the percentage of CD4+2H4+ (CD4+CD45R+) T cells, a T cell subset thought to be responsible for inducing suppression. Other abnormalities of T cells include cutaneous and in vitro anergy and evidence of T cell activation. Our results suggest that the B cell abnormalities seen in Kawasaki syndrome may be partially explained by defects in T cell immunoregulation.\r"

This review summarizes the effects of chemotherapy on immunity and suggests the most logical ways in which these categories of drugs might be combined with biomodulators. Specific examples are also provided of combination therapies that have proved useful or that are of significant potential utility. An understanding of the types of action and the mechanisms of action of specific chemotherapeutic agents and specific biomodulators may help to achieve additive effects (possibly synergism) with these combinations. At the very least, that understanding will avoid the hazard of one modality's negating the effects of the other.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the molecular events associated with postnatal and compensatory renal growth, the expression of growth/differentiation genes (c-fos, c-myc, c-H-ras, c-K-ras), a stress-related gene (HSP70) and a structural gene (collagen type IV, alpha 1 and 2) were examined. Northern analysis of messenger ribonucleic acid from the newborn mouse reveals high levels of expression of HSP70, c-H-ras, and c-K-ras during the first week of life. By day 40 HSP70-related and c-H-ras expression decreases somewhat, c-K-ras remains unchanged and collagen type IV, which encodes for the renal glomerular basement membrane, expression decreases significantly. During compensatory renal growth increased expression of HSP70, c-H-ras and c-K-ras occurs. The results seem to indicate that growth/differentiation genes may be necessary for continued cell growth (hypertrophy) in postnatal and compensatory renal growth, and that collagen type IV formation continues up through week 2 of postnatal growth consistent with the interval of glomerular basement membrane formation.\r"

In most patients clean intermittent catheterization is necessary for urinary drainage. We report on 4 patients with a sigmoid cystoplasty who perform clean intermittent catheterization and who have experienced a serious long-term complication, urinary reservoir perforation, which was fatal in 1. Two were adolescent girls with myelodysplasia and 2 were prepubertal boys with bladder exstrophy. One patient experienced 2 separate reservoir perforations. Rupture occurred 15 to 48 months (mean 30.2 months) after reconstruction. Diagnosis was made by a static cystogram, which demonstrated extravasation in 2 of 4 patients, and ultrasound. In 2 patients the cystogram was normal. Management included intravenous antibiotics and open abscess drainage in all patients. In patients who have undergone augmentation cystoplasty or continent diversion and in whom abdominal pain and distension develop reservoir perforation should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\r"

To create pyelonephritis vesicoureteral reflux of infected urine was surgically induced in 22 piglets. Nine animals were evaluated with a dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan at 1 week and 13 at 2 weeks. Autopsy and histopathological examination of the kidneys were performed subsequently. The location and extent of the inflammatory response found on histopathological examination were compared to dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings in a blinded fashion. Of the 22 kidneys subjected to vesicoureteral reflux 15 had positive histopathological findings of acute pyelonephritis, including 13 detected by the dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings. The 2 kidneys in which inflammation was not detected had only minimal grade I lesions and were grossly normal. There were no false positive scans in any of these kidneys. The sensitivity of the scan for detection of acute pyelonephritis in the kidneys subjected to reflux was 87 per cent and the specificity was 100 per cent. Furthermore, in these same kidneys the dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings correctly predicted the presence or absence of individual pyelonephritic lesions in 62 of 66 poles for an over-all agreement rate of 94 per cent. Thus, dimercapto-succinic acid renal cortical imaging is a highly sensitive and reliable imaging modality to detect and localize experimental acute pyelonephritis in piglets.\r"

The condition nevertheless is disabling and attempts to reach a precise diagnosis include diuretic excretory urography, ultrasonography and renal scans. The delayed double-peak pattern seen on 99mtechnetium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid diuretic renography shows how the ureteropelvic junction can become self-obstructing with forced diuresis. All patients who exhibited this sign eventually had frank obstruction and most exhibited an extrinsic component to the obstruction. The recognition of the double-peak pattern may become a useful adjunct in the early diagnosis of intermittent hydronephrosis.\r"

These findings suggest that multicystic kidney is a more common renal anomaly than was previously recognized and that the majority of cases remained undiagnosed before the advent of prenatal diagnosis. Ultrasound re-evaluation in 11 children suggests that the natural history of multicystic kidneys is towards spontaneous involution. Two kidneys were not identifiable by followup ultrasound. Hypertension and malignancy complicating multicystic kidney are reported infrequently. The literature on hypertension does not generally support the view that multicystic kidney poses a significant risk of hypertension in later childhood or adult life. We believe that the routine removal of multicystic kidneys in infancy is no longer appropriate.\r"

Abdominal aortic dissections are similar to thoracic dissections in their presentation, with acute shearing pain and systolic hypertension occurring commonly. Although the diagnosis may be made by ultrasonography or CT scanning, angiography is the definitive diagnostic study. Factors found to be associated with high mortality include presentation with acute pain (p less than 0.0003), involvement of visceral vessels (p less than 0.02), and rupture (p less than 0.000002). Chronicity appears to be protective (p less than 0.04), although chronic dissections may present acutely. Although prosthetic replacement of the involved aorta is the treatment of choice in most cases, nonoperative management with regular follow-up can be considered in asymptomatic chronic dissections.\r"

They may complain of a mass, headache, or other vague symptoms. Neurologic defects are rare; however, if a neurologic deficit exists, the physician should consider either arteriography or a head CT scan to search for intracranial pathologic conditions. In most cases the diagnosis may be made by obtaining a complete history and physical examination. The treatment of choice is ligation and resection, which may be accomplished with the patient under local or general anesthesia. In rare instances, arteriography with selective embolization may be useful when the traumatic aneurysm is complicated by severe facial trauma. Three cases of STA aneurysms are presented.

Key clinical issues include a high index of suspicion in patients sustaining major blunt deceleration and rotational or direct injuries to the neck, thorax, and/or upper extremities. Prompt diagnosis remains obscured by the presence of severe associated injuries, the treatment of which requires prioritization. Arteriography is invaluable to elucidate injury because prompt vascular control is dictated by various approaches depending on the location. Expeditious surgical repair is indicated to prevent complications of hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm, thromboembolism, and/or arteriovenous fistula. Long-term results appear to be good with major morbidity related to associated neurologic, soft tissue, and bony injuries.\r"

From 1983 through 1985, total inpatient costs (inflation adjusted) increased by less than 1% in hospitals in low-competition markets compared with a decrease of 11.29% in hospitals located in highly competitive markets. After controlling for the effects of the Medicare prospective payment system program, the rate of increase in cost per discharge in hospitals in highly competitive markets was 3.53% lower than the rate of increase in hospitals in low-competition markets during the period from 1983 through 1985. We conclude that these pro-competition policies are having dramatic and potentially far-reaching effects on the nature of hospital competition, leading to increased competition based on price.\r"

With increasing use of reparative techniques, including local resection of valve pathology and placement of an annuloplasty ring, and the realization that chronic atrial fibrillation leads to decreased long-term survival, the timing of surgery has changed. In addition, serial noninvasive studies have indicated that despite the absence of symptoms, patients may progress to a myopathic condition if the regurgitation progresses over a long period and surgery is not performed when signs of left ventricular dysfunction are evident. Preservation of the papillary muscle is also extremely important for late postoperative function in patients with mitral regurgitation, and reparative surgery that preserves both anterior and posterior papillary muscle complexes and continuity with the anulus appears to satisfy this assumption. Worldwide experience is reviewed and I present conclusions related to the appropriate indications for mitral valve repair or replacement in patients with mitral regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical success in rehabilitation of heroin addicts with maintenance treatment requires stability of the blood level in a pharmacologically effective range (optimally, 150 to 600 ng/mL)-a phenomenon that emphasizes the central importance of narcotic receptor occupation. It is postulated that the high rate of relapse of addicts after detoxification from heroin use is due to persistent derangement of the endogenous ligand-narcotic receptor system and that methadone in an adequate daily dose compensates for this defect. Some patients with long histories of heroin use and subsequent rehabilitation on a maintenance program do well when the treatment is terminated. The majority, unfortunately, experience a return of symptoms after maintenance is stopped. The treatment, therefore, is corrective but not curative for severely addicted persons. A major challenge for future research is to identify the specific defect in receptor function and to repair it. Meanwhile, methadone maintenance provides a safe and effective way to normalize the function of otherwise intractable narcotic addicts.\r"

Thus, RNA is not restricted to being a passive carrier of genetic information but can have an active role in directing cellular biochemistry. These findings suggest the possibility that other cellular RNAs, including the RNA components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, of the ribosome, and of various ribonucleoprotein enzymes, are catalysts. RNA enzymes (ribozymes) can be used as sequence-specific RNA cleavage agents in vitro, providing useful tools for biochemical studies of RNA. On a more speculative note, ribozymes directed against viral RNAs have the potential of serving as therapeutic agents. Finally, some infectious agents, including hepatitis delta virus and perhaps poliovirus and rhinoviruses, are themselves ribozymes, providing potential targets for pharmaceuticals.\r"

  ".W": "The splicing of long transcripts of RNA (copied from DNA in the cell nucleus) into smaller, specific mRNA (ready for export to the protein-producing machinery in the cytoplasm) is an important event in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The splicing reaction occurs as a late step in the nuclear pathway for synthesis of mRNAs. This pathway commences with initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and probably involves an integrated series of steps each dependent on previous events. Splicing of precursors to mRNAs involves the formation of a spliceosome complex containing the 5' and 3' splice sites. This complex contains the evolutionarily highly conserved small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) U2, U4, U5, and U6. The most abundant snRNA, U1, is required to form the spliceosome and may be a part of the spliceosome. Analogues of these snRNAs have been identified in yeast. Assembly of the spliceosome probably involves the binding of a multi-snRNA complex containing U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs. Several observations suggest that the association of snRNAs in such complexes is quite dynamic. It is argued that the snRNAs in the spliceosome form a catalytic RNA structure that is responsible for the cleavage and ligation steps during splicing.\r"

But the artist admitted to episodes of heavy drinking that were amply confirmed by colleagues and there is good evidence to indicate that addiction to absinthe exacerbated his illness. Absinthe was distilled from an alcoholic steep of herbs. Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) was the most significant constituent because it contributed thujone. This terpene can cause excitation, convulsions that mimic epilepsy, and even permanent brain damage. Statements in van Gogh's letters and from his friends indicate that he had an affinity for substances with a chemical connection to thujone; the documented examples are camphor and pinene. Perhaps he developed an abnormal craving for terpenes, a sort of pica, that would explain his attempts to eat paints and so on, which were previously regarded as unrelated absurdities.\r"

We sampled Medicare patients, aged 65 years and over, and non-Medicare comparison patients, aged 50 to 64 years, collecting data on case mix, treatment intensity and discharge disposition, hospital and six-month mortality, length of stay, and number of intensive care unit beds. After the PPS, the number of intensive care unit beds decreased 31%, without changes in MICU patients' illness severity or treatment intensity. Hospital length of stay decreased 15% in the Medicare group and 43% in the comparison group. For both Medicare and comparison patients combined, MICU length of stay decreased 14% and patients after the PPS were less likely to be discharged to go home. There were no significant changes in in-hospital or six-month mortality. Thus, clinically meaningful decreases in length of stay among seriously ill patients did not result in a change in in-hospital or six-month mortality.\r"

In 1987, we tested this definition on 1328 inpatients and outpatients in 15 hospitals throughout Uganda. Five hundred sixty-two patients (42%) were positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human immunodeficiency virus antibody. The World Health Organization definition had a sensitivity of 55%, a specificity of 85%, and a positive predictive value of 73%. Modification of the case definition by excluding a known cough from tuberculosis as a minor criteria decreased sensitivity slightly to 52%, but specificity and positive predictive value increased to 92% and 83%, respectively. Amenorrhea, although not specifically asked about, was a symptom noted by many female patients (26% of females who were positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay); as a symptom indicative of human immunodeficiency virus infection, amenorrhea had a specificity of 99%, with a positive predictive value of 89%. These findings support the generalizability of the World Health Organization clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome definition and its use (especially the modified version) in areas of Uganda without sophisticated facilities.\r"

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was administered to eight patients with severe aplastic anemia in an attempt to restore adequate hematopoiesis. Profound decreases in serum cholesterol concentrations were observed during GM-CSF therapy that were not dependent on changes in the patients' peripheral blood cell counts. Serum cholesterol levels decreased by an average of 37% during treatment, reaching levels of less than 4.40 mmol/L in all patients. Serum cholesterol concentrations returned to baseline in all patients after discontinuation of GM-CSF therapy. Treatment with GM-CSF prominently alters cholesterol homeostasis in vivo, although the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Our results suggest that GM-CSF may be potentially useful in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and, possibly, in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.\r"

Student health centers are available to approximately 10 million of the 12.5 million US university students. As many as 27,000 individuals, including probably more than 3000 physicians, work in SHCs. Sources and amount of funds expended for this care vary widely from campus to campus, as does the intensity of services offered. A survey of this nation's largest institutions suggests that an average of $102 per student per year is spent on SHCs. The total amount spent on student health care in this country may exceed $1 billion each year. Student health care faces opportunities and obstacles in the future as our ability to promote health and prevent disease improves, as institutions of higher education allocate their limited educational resources, and as society determines where to invest its limited medical resources.\r"

Early second-trimester (16 to 18 weeks) ultrasound determinations of the fetal biparietal diameter were used as the \"gold standard\" to test the validity of LNMP-based GA estimates in 11,045 women. The large majority of deliveries occurring at or near term showed LNMP estimates that were valid within plus or minus seven days of the ultrasound estimate. As the LNMP GA deviated progressively toward earlier or later GAs, however, the discrepancies became quite marked, especially for postterm dates. The positive predictive values of the LNMP GA estimates decreased dramatically from term (.949) to preterm (.775) to postterm (.119) deliveries. These systematic errors in menstrual GA estimates have profound implications for unnecessary induction, dysfunctional labor and cesarean section, and resultant neonatal and maternal morbidity.\r"

Newer advances, including gradient-echo techniques, three-dimensional fourier transformation, paramagnetic contrast, and more efficient receiver coils, will improve images and expand indications for MRI. The technology, however, remains relatively expensive, and the additional information compared with that of other techniques might not always justify the difference in cost. Moreover, MRI's insensitivity to calcifications, lack of depiction of fine bone detail, and, in some areas, degradation caused by motion and other artifacts make computed tomography and other noninvasive studies more appropriate as a primary imaging tool in many circumstances. Continued careful clinical research should clarify the relative role of MRI and other imaging tools during the next several years.\r"

Maleylation of BSA lead to an expansion of molecular size of native BSA from an effective molecular radius (EMR) of 37 A to 57 A for MBSA as assessed by gel filtration chromatography. MBSA, but not BSA, bound to the peripheral capillary wall (PCW) and mesangium in vitro in frozen sections, and in vivo following i.v. injection (0.006 mg/g body wt), examined by immunofluorescence. When similarly injected rats or controls were given antibodies to either MBSA or BSA following injection of antigen, immune complexes were observed in glomeruli by immunofluorescence and EM only in MBSA injected rats. Deposits occurred in the mesangium and subendothelium in the PCW. In frozen sections, bound MBSA could be partially removed from tissue sections by high ionic strength buffer. Also, binding of MBSA was diminished by prior treatment of sections with synthetic polyanions. Maleylated bovine gamma-globulin and succinylated BSA showed identical binding patterns as described for MBSA, indicating that binding was not unique to the modified BSA molecule nor to the form of anionization. These results indicate that charge interactions between circulating highly anionic macromolecules and cationic domains within glomerular structures are responsible, in part, for MBSA binding and subsequent localization of immune complexes. Furthermore, it is inferred that the selective binding of MBSA to glomeruli and formation of immune complexes occurred by a mechanism not related to difference in size between MBSA and BSA. These findings are different from conventionally understood charge interactions in glomerular immune complex formation.\r"

Experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats (50 to 165 days old). There were no changes in plasma renin activity or angiotensin II concentrations, but the number of angiotensin II binding sites in isolated glomeruli increased with increasing age (r = 0.87, P less than 0.01). Since rat weight varies directly with age, we studied the possibility that the increase in receptor number was due to changes in glomerular morphometrics. In a separate group of experiments the diameter of isolated glomeruli was measured, and assuming spherical shape, glomerular volume and surface area were calculated. Glomerular diameter increased with age and weight of the rats (r = 0.99, P less than 0.001). There was a strong linear correlation between the changes in angiotensin II receptor number and glomerular surface area (r = 0.99, P less than 0.001). The number of receptors per unit surface area was independent of rat weight or age (1224 receptors/micron 2). To test the hypothesis that the apparent increase in glomerular angiotensin II receptor sites with increasing age was due to the shape of the glomerulus, additional binding studies were performed on membranes prepared from isolated glomeruli. There were no differences in the number of angiotensin II receptors in membranes from 63 and 112 day-old rats (888 +/- 115 vs. 925 +/- 128 fmol/mg). In additional experiments the effects of increasing age on angiotensin modulation of renal function were studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent work has shown that the indicator dilution volume (IDV) exceeds true dialysate volume (TV) because the indicator or index solute is lost from the peritoneal cavity. A peritoneal transport model that includes significant solute loss from the peritoneal cavity is here described. Theory suggests that simultaneous measurements of both IDV and TV are required to calculate solute transport parameters for the peritoneal membrane when solutes are lost from the peritoneal cavity. The magnitude of systematic errors incurred by the use of either IDV or TV alone was determined in the calculated diffusive permeability-area product (PA) for creatinine during a two hour exchange in a rabbit model of peritoneal dialysis. IDV was measured using dextran (2 X 10(6) daltons) and TV by the dilution of multiple injections of Evans blue-albumin complex. Best estimates of PA using either or both volume measurements were determined in the blood to dialysate direction with isotonic (N = 9) and hypertonic (N = 7) solutions and in the dialysate to blood direction with isotonic (N = 4) and hypotonic (N = 4) solutions. Systematic errors in PA using either IDV alone or TV alone were small with either isotonic or hypertonic solutions but were increased with hypotonic solutions. Moreover, systematic errors were larger when using TV alone thaN IDV alone. When solute transport parameters for the peritoneal membrane are approximately determined employing only a single volume measurement, the use of IDV leads to less systematic error than TV.\r"

To determine whether vitamin D-dependent 28-kilodalton-calcium binding protein (28kDa-CaBP)and Ca++-Mg++ ATPase are present in the same cells of the human kidney, kidney tissue was examined for immunoreactivity with antibodies directed against these proteins. Double-label immunohistochemistry showed that a majority of the distal convoluted tubules contain epitopes to both of these proteins. portions of the distal nephron which were positive for 28kDa-CaBP did not show anti-Ca++-Mg++ ATPase antibody binding. All other portions of the nephron were negative for both proteins. Western blot analysis of kidney homogenates by 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), showed binding of an anti-Ca++-Mg ATPase monoclonal antibody to a major band of Mr = 140,000. Western blots of kidney homogenates by 10% SDS-PAGE also showed binding of an anti-28kDa-CaBP polyclonal antibody to a protein band at Mr = 28,000. Incubation of parallel blots from the same 10% gel with 45CaCl2 demonstrated that the Mr = 28,000 band binds calcium. This work demonstrates, for the first time, that epitopes of vitamin D-inducible 28kDa-CaBp and human erythrocyte Ca++-Mg++ ATPase pump are present in the same cells of the human kidney. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that 28kDa-CaBP binds calcium in a manner analogous to calmodulin, a known regulator of the erythrocyte Ca++-Mg ATPase pump (J Biol Chem, 1987).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89037940\r", 
  ".W": "Long considered a single clinical entity, essential hypertension is now recognized as a heterogeneous spectrum of pathophysiologic disturbances, based on extensive clinical, pharmacologic and biochemical evidence. Two distinctly different mechanisms for long-term vasoconstriction can be identified and quantified in the spectrum of patients with essential hypertension, although the causes of this group of disorders are still obscure. The first vasoconstrictor mechanism is renin-angiotensin mediated and involves an increase in vascular smooth muscle cytosolic free calcium mobilized from intracellular sites. The degree of activity of this mechanism can be assessed by plasma renin level and/or by the hypotensive response to circulating anti-renin-system drugs (such as CEI inhibitors and beta blockers). The second vasoconstrictor mechanism, on the other hand, is renin-independent. It appears to require antecedent renal sodium retention and to be related to abnormal membrane influx of calcium. A low plasma renin level identifies this kind of vasoconstriction, which is also characterized by a low serum ionized calcium. Low-renin vasoconstriction is correctable by sodium depletion or by calcium channel or alpha adrenergic blockade. Depending on the state of sodium balance, these two vasoconstrictor mechanisms contribute reciprocally to maintenance of arteriolar tone in models of experimental hypertension, normotensive and hypertensive people, and in the vasoconstriction of edematous states, such as congestive heart failure. One of the two mechanisms also sustains diastolic hypertension in the experimental and clinical forms of renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Thus, both experimentally and clinically, at the polar extremes of the range of plasma renin values, one of the two mechanisms predominates: it is possible that, in the medium range of renin values, both mechanisms contribute to vasoconstriction. In our proposed unifying, analytic model, arteriolar vasoconstriction is associated with increased intracellular calcium and decreased magnesium levels in vascular smooth muscle. In the vasoconstriction consequent to sodium-volume expansion, cytosolic calcium is increased by an increased membrane influx. In renin-mediated vasoconstriction, receptor-operated channels mobilize cytosolic calcium instead from intracellular stores. These interrelationships provide a basis for stratifying hypertensive patients pathophysiologically and for applying simpler, more specific, and more rational therapies. Thus, the array of modern pharmacologic agents can often be rationally directed at one or the other, or both, of these two vasoconstrictor mechanisms.\r"

Furthermore, direct evidence for a primary role of AA metabolites in the long term control of blood pressure emerges from the interrelationship between angiotensin II, vasopressin, norepinephrine, and alfa-adrenergic stimuli. Since locally synthetized vasodilatory PG are known to modulate the effects of vasoconstrictor stimuli on renal vasculature and sodium excretion, it is suggested that an alteration of this interplay may be responsible for some forms of experimental and human hypertension.\r"

Streptococcus viridans (11 episodes), diphtheroids (5 episodes), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 episodes) accounted for the majority of the other pathogens causing bacteremia. Six episodes of fungemia were also seen. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were demonstrated in 31 of 36 (86%) throat cultures, 25 of 35 (71%) stool cultures, and 6 of 7 (86%) Hickman or Broviac catheter exit site surveillance cultures prior to the development of bacteremia caused by these organisms. Throat surveillance cultures positive for S. viridans also showed a correlation (88%) with subsequent S. viridans bacteremia. However, surveillance cultures for aerobic gram-negative bacilli, diphtheroids, and fungi did not correlate with subsequent septicemia. Organisms isolated in throat surveillance cultures correlated with subsequent bacteremia caused by these organisms in only 15% of all the cultures taken, while only 14% of stool cultures predicted bacteremia. The utility of surveillance cultures is limited because of low cost-effectiveness and a high rate of false-positive results.\r"

The estimated 6-year survival was 60% for CF patients vs. 31% for control patients (P = 0.001). The estimated 6-year disease-free survival was 53.6 and 30.3% for CF and control, respectively (P = 0.007). There was a trend toward longer disease-free survival (DFS) and survival (S) in patients treated with CF, but this was not significant in all the subgroups. Disease-free survival was statistically significant in the subgroup of women greater than or equal to 50 years old with one to three positive nodes (P = 0.038); survival in the patients less than or equal to 49 years old with four or more positive nodes (P = 0.0036); and in patients greater than or equal to 50 years old with one to three lymph nodes involvement (P = 0.038).\r"

Transtracheal aspiration was performed in 82 instances, fine needle aspiration in 47, and both procedures in 23. Both transtracheal and fine needle aspiration were highly specific, 96% and 100%, respectively. Sensitivity for transtracheal aspiration was lower than for fine needle aspiration, 70% and 89%, respectively. The lower sensitivity of transtracheal aspiration is attributed to its performance in all patients with suspected infection regardless of chest radiographic findings. Fine needle aspiration was performed when identifiable lesions could be used as a \"target.\" Overall accuracy of transtracheal aspiration was 78% compared to 91% for fine needle aspiration both alone and combined with transtracheal aspiration. More invasive procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage and open lung biopsy were required in only three patients (2%). Transtracheal aspiration resulted in one minor complication (1%). The commonest complication of fine needle aspiration was pneumothorax (21%). There were no deaths associated with either procedure. We conclude that in heart and heart-lung transplant patients with suspected pulmonary infection, transtracheal aspiration and fine needle aspiration are safe and accurate methods to identify the causative organism. More invasive techniques may be required in a small minority of patients.\r"

Lung preservation for 6 hours was achieved by topical cooling and storage at 4 degrees C after absorption atelectasis in five dogs and in a further five dogs by pulmonary arterial perfusion of Euro-Collins solution; 60 ml/kg at 4 degrees C, modified with MgSO4 6 mmol/L followed by storage at 4 degrees C. Dogs in the perfusion group were pretreated with an infusion of the synthetic analog of prostaglandin I2, iloprost (20 ng/kg/min). The ischemic times were 5.97 hours +/- 0.09 for the topical cooling group and 5.96 hours +/- 0.04 for the perfusion group. After transplantation, artificial ventilation at a fixed oxygen concentration was continued until the recipient's death or elective termination of the experiment at 24 hours. Assessment of pulmonary preservation was by animal survival, blood gas analyses, and measurement of lung weight and water in the transplanted lung. No animal in the topical cooling group survived more than 5.5 hours after transplantation; all perfusion recipients survived 24 hours. Oxygenation in the topical cooling group was significantly reduced 1 hour after contralateral ligation: Oxygen tension was 224.2 mm Hg +/- 5.8 before ligation and 92.6 mm Hg +/- 22.3 after ligation (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unfortunately, this technique gives a discontinuous evaluation of the recipient immunologic status. A noninvasive marker of immunologic activation and of allograft rejection that would permit a more continuous monitoring than the biopsy technique would be clinically useful. Urinary polyamine excretion reflects cellular proliferation or degeneration and, as a marker of cellular metabolic activity, may also reflect lymphocyte proliferation and organ rejection. From July 1985 to December 1986, urinary polyamines were studied in 18 patients during hospitalization for heart and heart-lung transplantation. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed twice a week and histologic rejection was characterized by standard criteria. Urinary specimens were collected daily and analyzed for polyamines by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Concentrations of acetylputrescine and total urinary polyamines were significantly higher before the 20 rejection episodes than before the 80 biopsies yielding negative results. So that their clinical usefulness could be evaluated, an elevation of polyamines and a daily level variability of 28% or more was chosen to indicate increased metabolic cellular activity and to predict rejection in the next 8 days. On the basis of these definitions, the sensitivity of polyamine assays to predict rejection was 85%, the specificity 88%, and the positive predictive value 79%. Therefore, serial measurements of urinary polyamines may provide daily information on the recipient's immunologic status after cardiac transplantation.\r"

Concurrently, 19 patients, also undergoing operation on the thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta, were operated on with a variety of conventional techniques, including distal aortic perfusion, but were not given intrathecal papaverine. No signs of early neurologic injury developed in any of the patients in the intrathecal papaverine group, although delayed paraparesis developed in one of the patients (9%; 70% confidence limits = 1% to 28%). On the other hand, eight of 19 patients undergoing operation with conventional techniques had either lower extremity paraparesis or paraplegia postoperatively (42%; 70% confidence limits = 29% to 57%; p = 0.058). Intrathecal papaverine appeared to provide spinal cord protection during thoracic aortic operations, particularly during prolonged periods of aortic cross-clamping. Papaverine was not associated with increased risk and may be superior to other conventionally used modalities. We conclude that continued evaluation of this technique is justified.\r"

  ".U": "89038675\r", 
  ".W": "The most important dietary goal for individuals with type I diabetes mellitus is the establishment of a regular meal pattern with consistent day-to-day caloric and carbohydrate intake. Ideally, the diet should contain 55 to 60 per cent of total calories as carbohydrate, less than 30 per cent of calories as fat, less than 10 per cent of calories as saturated fat, and less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day. The best tool for helping type I individuals achieve these objectives is the Exchange Lists for Meal Planning. A second important dietary goal in type I diabetes is to avoid weight gain during intensive treatment programs. The most important dietary and therapeutic goal in obese persons with type II diabetes is weight loss. Unfortunately, no dietary method, whether initiated by self-help groups like TOPS, physicians, or other health care professionals, has been demonstrated to be effective in achieving and maintaining weight loss. Nevertheless, some individual patients will be successful, and it therefore is appropriate to attempt weight reduction with a balanced diet moderately restricted in calories. A reduction of 500 calories per day below the weight maintenance level is reasonable and can be expected to produce weight loss of about 1 lb per week. For those type II diabetic patients who are not able to lose weight and are at least twice their ideal body weight, gastric reduction surgery could be considered. The Glycemic Index of Foods is a new concept that has not been evaluated adequately. Recent evidence suggests that differences among foods are reduced when the foods are combined in a meal and thus raises questions about the utility of glycemic indexing. The longstanding restriction on the use of sucrose in the diabetic diet is without scientific basis. Recognizing this, the American Diabetes Association recently sanctioned consumption of modest amounts of sucrose in the diabetic diet. Although conclusive evidence is not yet available that high fiber diets improve glycemic control or reduce serum lipids in diabetic persons, it appears reasonable to encourage the consumption of natural foods high in soluble fiber. Vegetables (particularly legumes), oats, and many fruits are good sources. The American Diabetes Association recommends a goal of 40 g of soluble fiber intake per day. The dietary treatment of diabetes is likely to be more successful if physicians learn more about its essential features and pay it greater attention. The goals of dietary therapy are difficult to achieve and often require significant sacrifices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "As more is understood about the physiology of exercise, both in normal and in diabetic subjects, its role in the treatment of diabetes is becoming better defined. Although persons with diabetes may derive many benefits from regular physical exercise, there also are a number of hazards that make exercise difficult to manage. In insulin-treated diabetics, there are risks of hypoglycemia during or after exercise or of worsening metabolic control if insulin deficiency is present. Type II diabetics being treated with sulfonylureas also are at some increased risk of developing hypoglycemia during or following exercise, although this is less of a problem than occurs with insulin treatment. In individuals treated by diet alone, regulation of blood glucose during exercise usually results in a decrease in glucose concentration toward normal but not to hypoglycemic levels and exercise can be used safely as an adjunct to diet to achieve weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. When obese patients with type II diabetes are treated with very low calorie diets, adequate amounts of carbohydrate must be provided to ensure maintenance of normal muscle glycogen content, particularly if individuals wish to participate in high intensity exercise that places a heavy workload on specific muscle groups. On the other hand, moderate intensity exercise such as vigorous walking can be tolerated by individuals on very low calorie, carbohydrate-restricted diets after an appropriate period of adaptation. A number of strategies can be employed to avoid hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes and both type I and type II diabetic subjects should be examined carefully for long term complications of their disease, which may be worsened by exercise. These considerations have led many diabetologists to consider exercise to be beneficial in the management of diabetes for some individuals but not to be recommended for everyone as a \"necessary\" part of diabetic treatment as was thought in the past. Instead, the goals should be to teach patients to incorporate exercise into their daily lives if they wish and to develop strategies to avoid the complications of exercise. The rationale for the use of exercise as part of the treatment program in type II diabetes is much clearer and regular exercise may be prescribed as an adjunct to caloric restriction for weight reduction and as a means of improving insulin sensitivity in the obese, insulin-resistant individual.\r"

Data on relative safety suggest that chlorpropamide is the most toxic sulfonylurea but glyburide causes dangerous hypoglycemia as often as chlorpropamide. For many patients, good blood glucose control will be achieved by taking tolbutamide or another sulfonylurea 30 minutes before breakfast and the main evening meal. The biguanide metformin, which is as safe as glyburide, is of use in treating overweight diabetic patients who do not have cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal dysfunction.\r"

The Diabetic Retinopathy Study and the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study have demonstrated that timely intervention with photocoagulation prevents visual loss. However, recent studies demonstrate that many diabetic patients are not being referred to ophthalmologists for timely treatment. Suggested management and referral strategies are presented in this article.\r"

The precise role of therapies such as continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy and aldose reductase inhibitors remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".U": "89038687\r", 
  ".W": "Diabetic foot lesions most commonly result from a combination of neuropathy and vascular disease in the lower extremity, and may be the presenting feature of diabetes in the older patient. Insufficient attention previously has been given to the careful clinical assessment of the foot, which enables the physician to recognize those patients who are at particular risk of ulceration. The high-risk patient requires education and frequent follow up to reduce the risk of lesions developing. If ulceration develops, healing is likely to occur if the vascular supply is adequate, infection and the blood glucose are controlled, and pressures that may have caused the ulcer are relieved. The ischemic foot requires full vascular assessment, involving colleagues from vascular surgery. The key to a future reduction in the incidence of diabetic foot ulceration is the setting up of a foot care team in which the skills of nurses, podiatrists, orthotists, physicians, and surgeons are combined. The most important members of the team, however, are the patients, who must be convinced that regular foot care will reduce their chances of developing ulceration and other catastrophic consequences, such as amputation.\r"

Perinatal infection had a more varied clinical picture and a worse outcome compared with infection acquired later in childhood. Severe secondary infections, neurological disorders, and hepatitis (but not lymphoid interstitial pneumonia) were linked to a high mortality rate in perinatally infected children, in whom an early onset of symptoms was also a bad prognostic factor. Perinatal HIV infection occurred in 32.6% of children born to seropositive mothers, with a higher transmission rate in children born by vaginal delivery and then breast-fed. Preterm delivery and low birthweight seemed to be related to drug abuse during pregnancy, not to intrauterine HIV infection. Girls had a higher rate of perinatal infection and, of those infected, had an increased mortality.\r"

The resultant values of 110, 95, 85, 83, 83, 84, and 85 kcal/kg/day at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, are substantially lower than current Department of Health and Social Security and FAO/WHO/UNU recommended dietary allowances. Evidence from diet surveys suggests that changes in infant feeding practices are largely responsible for the apparent reduction in energy requirements. Dietary guidelines may need to be reappraised, to avoid overfeeding of infants.\r"

Oestrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone (PgR) receptors were assayed in most cases. 308 premenopausal node-negative and postmenopausal node-negative or node-positive patients were randomised to receive TM, 30 mg daily for 2 years, or no further therapy. 125 premenopausal node-positive patients were randomised to receive either CMF for nine courses plus TM or CMF alone. After a median follow-up of 63 months TM significantly reduced the incidence of relapses and deaths compared with no therapy. A significant interaction between treatment effect and ER/PgR status was seen. Disease-free and overall survival were similar after treatment with CMF+ TM or CMF.\r"
