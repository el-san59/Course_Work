The sensitivity of the assays, based on 214 specimens positive by western blot, ranged from 84.6% to 99.1%. The specificity, based on 3664 samples negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or western blot, ranged from 92.7% to 98.8%. Three readers scored each test result independently; disagreement about test interpretation occurred in 1.2-8.3% of the specimens. There was no correlation between assay performance and assay principle (agglutination or dot immunobinding) or antigen source (viral lysate or recombinant). Assays such as these can be readily implemented in a developing country transfusion centre, where blood screening by ELISA is not practicable.\r"

  ".W": "The leukotrienes LTC4, D4, and E4 are potent bronchoconstrictor agents and are thought to have an important role in asthma. Urinary LTE4, a stable urinary end-product of LTC4 and LTD4, was measured, by means of high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. LTE4 excretion followed a log-normal distribution in twenty-nine healthy controls, with a geometric mean of 23.8 (95% confidence interval 19.9-28.2) ng/mmol creatinine. Urine was collected from eight atopic subjects for 3 h after antigen inhalation and a control urine collection was made a week later at the same time of day. Urinary LTE4 was significantly higher after antigen challenge than in the control sample (153.7 [87.1-271.3] vs 23.5 [13.7-69.5] ng/mmol creatinine; p less than 0.01). Urinary LTE4 was also measured in twenty patients with severe acute asthma and nine patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Mean urinary LTE4 was higher in the asthmatic patients (78.3 [46.5-131.8] ng/mmol creatinine) than in normal subjects (p less than 0.01), although there was substantial overlap into the normal range. The urinary LTE4 values of the rhinitis patients were within the normal range whether or not they had symptoms. LTC4 and LTD4 were also found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from one of the three atopic subjects challenged with antigen before lavage, and in a single patient who underwent lavage after admission with severe acute asthma. These studies provide evidence that leukotrienes are released in vivo in man after antigen challenge and in acute asthma.\r"

There were 5 men and 5 women with a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of 9.6 years. Nine were rheumatoid factor positive and had associated nodules. In addition to standard treatment regimens, 9 patients received corticosteroids. Although involvement of the thoracic aorta was most common, involvement of both the thoracic and abdominal aorta was present in 4 cases. Two patients had aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta and 1 of the abdominal aorta. Microscopic features of aortitis included necrosis of medial smooth muscle and elastica, with an inflammatory infiltrate comprising primarily lymphocytes and plasma cells. A panmural aortitis was seen in 3 cases. Rheumatoid granulomas were noted in the aortic wall in 5. The diagnosis of aortitis was not made until autopsy in any case. Aortitis was hemodynamically significant in 3 patients. Two had congestive heart failure secondary to thoracic aortitis and aortic valvulitis, and 1 had rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm at a site involved by aortitis. Seven patients had rheumatoid vasculitis with a mean of 10 organs involved. Six of these died of complications directly related to vasculitis, including 4 patients with coronary arteritis and associated myocardial infarction. Aortitis can be a feature of severe rheumatoid arthritis and is often associated with rheumatoid vasculitis. Hemodynamic compromise does occur and may be fatal.\r"

Fourteen patients (15 percent) had an increase in serum creatinine concentrations (greater than or equal to 35 mumol per liter [greater than or equal to 0.4 mg per deciliter]); in 16 percent of the 61 patients with apparently good control of blood pressure, the serum creatinine concentration rose 59 +/- 33 mumol per liter (0.67 +/- 0.38 mg per deciliter). Despite good control of diastolic blood pressure (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg), black patients were twice as likely as white patients to have elevations in serum creatinine (23 percent vs. 11 percent). Stepwise discriminant function analysis showed that a significant rise in the serum creatinine concentration was most likely to occur in association with older age, black race, a higher number of missed office visits, and employment as a laborer. We conclude that although renal function was preserved in 85 percent of patients with treated hypertension, it may deteriorate in some patients despite good blood-pressure control. Our observations may partly explain why hypertension, particularly among black persons, remains a leading cause of renal disease in the United States.\r"

To evaluate whether this condition antedates diagnosis, we identified 43 persons with Hodgkin's disease, from whom blood had been drawn and stored for an average of 50.5 months before diagnosis, and 96 controls from the same populations, from whom blood had been drawn at the same time. The relative risks of Hodgkin's disease associated with elevated levels of IgG and IgA antibodies against capsid antigen were 2.6 (90 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.1) and 3.7 (1.4 to 9.3), respectively. For Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen, the relative risk was 4.0 (1.4 to 11.4), and for early antigen D it was 2.6 (1.1 to 6.1). However, the prevalence of IgM antibody against capsid antigen was substantially lower in patients with Hodgkin's disease (0.22 [0.04 to 1.3]). These associations were stronger in serum samples obtained at least three years before diagnosis than in serum samples obtained closer to diagnosis. We conclude that the development of Hodgkin's disease may in some patients be preceded by enhanced activation of Epstein-Barr virus. Whether Epstein-Barr virus has a direct role in the pathogenesis of the disease or is simply a marker for a more fundamental factor affecting the immune control of latent infections is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the influence of physicians' practice styles on the rate of deliveries by cesarean section, we studied 1533 affluent women at low risk of obstetrical complications who were cared for by 11 obstetricians in a single community hospital. The mean rate of delivery by cesarean section was 26.9 percent, but the rate ranged from 19.1 to 42.3 percent, according to the physician. The mean rate of primary cesarean section (i.e., the rate for women without previous cesarean deliveries) was 17.2, with a range of 9.6 to 31.8 percent. A stepwise logistic-regression model of the determinants of primary cesarean section, including the individual physician, parity, birth weight, and maternal age and excluding specific medical indications, showed that only nulliparity (P less than 0.0001) was more important than the identity of the physician (P less than 0.001) in its influence on the rate of cesarean section. Variation in cesarean-section rates among physicians was not attributable to the practice setting, the patient population, the degree of obstetrical risk, or the physician's recent medicolegal experience, and it was not accompanied by corresponding differences in neonatal outcome. We conclude that individual practice style may be an important determinant of the wide variations in the rates of cesarean delivery among obstetricians. Our data do not permit us to say with certainty whether the procedure is overused by some obstetricians or underused by others, but we found no obvious differences in neonatal outcome associated with differences in the cesarean-section rate.\r"

A possible role of adrenergic innervation or of cellular calcium regulation is suggested by the presence of hyperdynamic left ventricular function and by the clinical and symptomatic improvement seen in patients treated with beta-receptor antagonists or calcium antagonists. Therefore, we measured the density of calcium-antagonist receptors and beta-adrenoceptors in the atrial myocardium of 16 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 19 patients with various other cardiac disorders. For comparison, we also measured the number of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Calcium-antagonist binding sites, measured as the amount of dihydropyridine bound to atrial tissue, were increased by 33 percent in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (mean [+/- SD], 397 +/- 104 fmol per milligram of protein in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as compared with 299 +/- 108 in patients with other cardiac disorders; P less than 0.01). The densities of saxitoxin-binding sites on voltage-sensitive sodium channels and beta-adrenoceptors were the same in the two groups, although the density of beta-adrenoceptors was higher in atrial samples from patients receiving beta-receptor antagonists (165 +/- 86 fmol per milligram of protein [patients receiving beta-blockers] vs. 85 +/- 60 [patients not receiving beta-blockers]; P less than 0.04). The increase in the number of calcium-antagonist receptors in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggests that abnormal calcium fluxes through voltage-sensitive calcium channels may play a pathophysiologic part in the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Opinions differ concerning the efficacy of prophylaxis against neonatal chlamydial and gonococcal conjunctivitis. From January 1986 through June 1988, we gave all infants born at Kings County Hospital Medical Center one of three prophylactic agents -- silver nitrate drops, erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, or tetracycline ophthalmic ointment. The treatments were rotated monthly. Gonococcal ophthalmia occurred in 8 of the 12,431 infants born during the study (0.06 percent), 1 in the silver nitrate group, 4 in the erythromycin group, and 3 in the tetracycline group (P not significant). Seven of these infants were born to women who had received no prenatal care. From September 1985 through December 1987, we screened 4357 pregnant women for cervical chlamydial infection, of whom 341 (8 percent) had positive cultures. Of their offspring, 230 were evaluated for neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis; the incidence was 20 percent in the silver nitrate group, 14 percent in the erythromycin group, and 11 percent in the tetracycline group (P not significant). We conclude that neonatal ocular prophylaxis with either erythromycin or tetracycline ophthalmic ointment does not significantly reduce the incidence of chlamydial conjunctivitis in the offspring of mothers with chlamydial infection as compared with silver nitrate, and that better management of maternal chlamydial infection is therefore required. We also conclude that there is a small but appreciable incidence of neonatal gonococcal ophthalmia that could be prevented by better prenatal screening and treatment of maternal gonococcal infection.\r"

We determined the ABO, P, and Lewis blood-group phenotypes in 49 white women with histories of recurrent urinary tract infections and compared them with those found in 49 healthy control women without recurrent urinary tract infections. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the distribution of the ABO or P phenotypes. The distribution of Lewis blood-group phenotypes among control women was similar to that in the general population: secretor phenotype (Le(a-b+)), 74 percent; nonsecretor phenotype (Le(a+b-)), 18 percent; and recessive phenotype (Le(a-b-)), 8 percent. The following distribution was noted among the women with recurrent urinary tract infections: secretor phenotype, 45 percent; nonsecretor phenotype, 29 percent; and recessive phenotype, 26 percent (P = 0.002). When the women with nonsecretor and recessive phenotypes were combined and considered collectively, the odds ratio (an estimate of relative risk of recurrent urinary tract infection) for those without the secretor phenotype was 3.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 7.9). We conclude that there is an increased frequency of the Lewis blood-group nonsecretor (Le(a+b-] and recessive (Le(a-b-] phenotypes among women with recurrent urinary tract infections.\r"

The large amount of information on the distribution of HIV infections in San Francisco's gay community suggests the opposite approach--estimating the incubation distribution, assuming known infection and diagnosis distributions. A non-parametric implementation of this strategy produced an estimate with a median at 9.8 years, increasing hazard rates, and less uncertainty than previous estimates.\r"

The coordinate regulation is apparent in the repression of synthesis of these determinants in response to environmental stimuli; a phenomenon known as antigenic or phenotypic modulation. B. pertussis also varies between metastable genetic states, or phases. There is a virulent phase in which virulence-associated determinants are synthesized, and an avirulent phase in which they are not. Previous studies have shown that a genetic locus, vir, is required for expression from many virulence-associated loci, and that replacing the cloned vir locus in trans can restore the virulent phase phenotype to spontaneously occurring avirulent phase strains. Here, we show that phase variation in one series of strains is due to a frameshift mutation within an open reading frame that is predicted to code for a Vir protein product. The deduced protein sequence is similar to both components of the 'two-component' regulatory system which control gene expression in response to environmental stimuli in a range of bacterial species.\r"

In addition, a number of strategies are emerging for the generation of catalytic antibodies including transition state stabilization, catalysis by approximation, and the introduction of catalytic groups or cofactors into antibody combining sites. An important goal in the design of catalytic antibodies is the development of general rules relating hapten structure to the corresponding catalytic groups in the antibody combining site. We report here that electrostatic interactions between a hapten and the complementary antibody can be exploited to generate catalytic amino-acid side chains in an antibody-combining site. The antibody-catalysed reaction, a beta-elimination reaction, exhibits saturation kinetics, substrate specificity, competitive inhibition by hapten, and specific inactivation by a reagent that modifies carboxylate residues.\r"

This region contains two subregions (CI and CII), encoded in two separate exons, that are analogous to the 'zinc fingers' of the transcription factor TFIIIA. The N-terminal CI finger determines the recognition specificity of the hormone responsive element. A chimaeric oestrogen receptor, in which the CI finger is replaced with the corresponding glucocorticoid receptor CI finger region, activates transcription from a reporter gene containing a glucocorticoid-responsive element, but not from a reporter gene containing an oestrogen-responsive element. We report here that three amino acids located at the C-terminal side of the oestrogen receptor CI finger play a key part in this specificity.\r"

Recently, we have shown that neurons in the cat visual cortex have oscillatory responses in the range 40-60 Hz (refs 1, 2) which occur in synchrony for cells in a functional column and are tightly correlated with a local oscillatory field potential. This led us to hypothesize that the synchronization of oscillatory responses of spatially distributed, feature selective cells might be a way to establish relations between features in different parts of the visual field. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that neurons in spatially separate columns can synchronize their oscillatory responses. The synchronization has, on average, no phase difference, depends on the spatial separation and the orientation preference of the cells and is influenced by global stimulus properties.\r"

Electrophysiological studies have shown that these activators can either depress or increase Ca2+ currents, or decrease K+ currents when applied outside the cell. It has been assumed that these effects are mediated by protein kinase C activation. Here we report that micromolar levels of OAG and phorbol esters depress Ca2+ currents in chick sensory neurons independently of their effect as activators of protein kinase C. The depression of the Ca2+ current is rapid and is unaffected by intracellular application of the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporin, sphingosine and H-7. Furthermore, the activators were ineffective when applied intracellularly, indicating that their site of action is on the outside of the membrane.\r"

  ".U": "89159432\r", 
  ".W": "Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome is a rare familial neurodegenerative condition that is vertically transmitted, in an apparently autosomal dominant way. It can also be horizontally transmitted to non-human primates and rodents through intracerebral inoculation of brain homogenates from patients with the disease. The exact incidence of the syndrome is unknown but is estimated to be between one and ten per hundred million. Patients initially suffer from ataxia or dementia and deteriorate until they die, in one to ten years. Protease-resistant prion protein (PrP) and PrP-immunoreactive amyloid plaques with characteristic morphology accumulate in the brains of these patients. Current diagnostic criteria for Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome incorporate clinical and neuropathological features, as animal transmission studies can be unreliable. PrP is implicated in the pathogenesis and transmission of the condition and in scrapie, an equivalent animal disease. It was discovered by enriching scrapie-infected hamster brain fractions for infectivity. Because there is compelling evidence that the scrapie isoform of PrP is a necessary component of the infectious particle, it seemed possible that the PrP gene on the short arm of human chromosome 20 in Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome might be abnormal. We show here that PrP codon 102 is linked to the putative gene for the syndrome in two pedigrees, providing the best evidence to date that this familial condition is inherited despite also being infectious, and that substitution of leucine for proline at PrP codon 102 may lead to the development of Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome.\r"

In general, however, the expression conferred by these elements on genes reintroduced into the genomes of cell lines and transgenic animals has turned out to be at a low level relative to that of endogenous genes, and influenced by the chromosomal site of insertion of the exogenous construct. We have previously shown that if regions flanking the human beta-globin locus are introduced into the mouse genome along with the human beta-globin gene, a level of expression comparable to that of endogenous genes can be achieved that is also independent of integration site. We have now defined a dominant control region with these properties consisting of 6.5 kilobases of DNA encompassing erythroid cell-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites. The identification of such dominant control regions could have important applications in somatic gene therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A metal-backed, interchangeable, meniscal bearing knee replacement system has been designed to combine low constraint forces with low contact stresses (LCS) to allow nearly normal joint articulation and loading as well as long-term wear resistance of the implants. System components allow unicompartmental, bicompartmental, tricompartmental, and revision knee arthroplasties. In this prospective comparison study, the early series of cases used methyl methacrylate for prosthesis-to-bone fixation, whereas the more recent series of knee replacements used sintered-bead porous coating to allow tissue ingrowth stabilization of all implants. Overall results in the first 149 cemented cases with 2- to 10-year follow-up (mean 7.6 years) were good to excellent in 85.2 per cent, fair in 3.4 per cent, and poor in 11.4 per cent using a strict knee scoring scale. Fair and poor results were seen predominantly in multiply operated and implant revision cases. The best cemented results were noted in primary cases, 95.1 per cent of which had good to excellent results. Overall results in the first 208 cementless cases with 2- to 7-year follow-up (mean 4.4 years) were good to excellent in 91.8 per cent, fair in 2.4 per cent, and poor in 5.8 per cent. Fair and poor results were also seen predominantly in multiply operated and implant revision cases. The best cementless results were noted in primary cases, 98.2 per cent of which had good to excellent results. Of 140 meniscal bearing implants in the entire series, one dislocation occurred (0.7 per cent) which required open bearing replacement. Of 217 rotating platform bearing implants in the entire series, 7 dislocations occurred (3.2 per cent), which required open bearing replacement or revision of components for malposition. These dislocations were seen predominantly in revision cases involving insufficient flexion stability; 6 of the 7 cases were revisions. This study demonstrates the efficacy of mobile bearing elements for use in knee replacement arthroplasty. It is essential that flexion and extension gaps be controlled to maintain contact pressure on such bearings to avoid problems of subluxation or dislocation.\r"

The results were satisfactory, especially in postoperative management, which was much easier with the Koshino blade plate fixation than with other methods. The sinking of the osteotomy site was checked through observation of screw movement in the slot of the plate during postoperative management in 53 selected knees, and the averaged distance of sinking was 3.9 +/- 2.5 mm. The time of mechanical bone union judged by cessation of sinking averaged 12.9 +/- 6.2 weeks after osteotomy.\r"

By the end of 1986 an overall attack rate of 8.3 cases/100,000 total population per year had been calculated. The attack rate in children younger than 15 years was 30.4/100,000/year and the highest rate occurred in children younger than 5 years: all Auckland 68.8/100,000/year; South and Central Auckland 98.7/100,000/year. Seventy-nine percent of cases younger than 15 years of age occurred in 30% of the childhood population. The overall case-fatality ratio was 7% with the highest rate (22%) occurring in male children age 1 to 2 years. An outbreak in an industrialized country of an infectious disease usually seen in developing countries calls for investigation of living conditions and other sociodemographic factors in the population affected. Specific action in the form of a vaccination program particularly targeted to those at risk was planned and implemented before the winter of 1987.\r"

Serum cortisol concentrations at presentation and again after recovery from infection were determined. Overall mean magnitude change in cortisol concentrations was 3.6-fold. Cortisol response was unrelated to the height of temperature but significant differences depending on clinical diagnosis were identified. The largest response (5-fold) was observed in patients with pneumonia, bacterial meningitis and fever of undetermined etiology. Current recommendations to double or triple replacement hydrocortisone dosage during times of increased stress in children with adrenal insufficiency are adequate only for simple febrile illnesses such as upper respiratory infection and streptococcal pharyngitis but could be subtherapeutic for infections such as pneumonia, meningitis and fever of undetermined origin, which imply a greater systemic involvement. It is possible, but untested, that a 4- to 5-fold increase in dosage would be more appropriate in those conditions.\r"

Patients studied were ages 3 to 24 months with a body temperature of greater than or equal to 39.4 degrees C and nonfocal illness. During these 11 years, 23 such babies had bacteremia, 21 with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Three risk factors for bacteremia were identified: absolute neutrophil counts greater than or equal to 10,500/microliters; cool season (November to April), and Yale observation score greater than 10. The positive predictive values for bacteremia were 33, 41 and 57%, respectively, when (1) absolute neutrophil count was greater than or equal to 10,500, (2) absolute neutrophil count was greater than or equal to 10,500 and it was the cool season, and (3) all 3 risk factors existed. Of 158 babies at low risk for bacteremia by these criteria, none was treated and none developed serious complications of bacteremia. Eight of the 23 bacteremic infants received no expectant antibiotic therapy and 15 received presumptive amoxicillin treatment in dosages ranging from 20 to 174 mg/kg/day. Twelve bacteremic infants either were not treated or received dosages of 100 mg/kg/day or less; complications developed in 5 of the 12 (persistent bacteremia, 2; facial cellulitis, 3). The remaining 11 bacteremic babies received approximately 150 mg/kg/day (range, 136 to 174) and none had complications (P = 0.03 by Fisher's exact test). The costs of identifying and treating infants suspected of having possible occult bacteremia were examined.\r"

During the same surveillance period Echo 7 was cultured from 20 infants, and 6 infants had concurrent RSV and Echo 7 and RSV were isolated, but not concurrently. This dual outbreak of RSV and Echo 7 infections persisted for months despite infection control measures. Control procedures were complicated by: (1) cases of RSV infection at less than 72 hours of age, which had not previously been reported and which led to the reintroduction of RSV into \"clean\" areas; (2) the lack of a rapid diagnostic test for enterovirus infection; (3) the number of infants who were asymptomatic with each infection; and (4) the logistical problems of handling a dual pathogen outbreak in a confined setting. These problems were compounded by the many risk factors associated with nosocomial infections found in neonatal intensive care settings such as prolonged hospitalizations, endotracheal or nasogastric tubes and contact with many ancillary care personnel.\r"

The major group of 88 patients consisted of children with fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C measured at the hospital within 24 hours of diagnosis, bacteriuria verified by suprapubic bladder aspiration or repeated cultures of voided urine, but without concomitant disease. These children were mainly infected with attaching Escherichia coli specific for galactose alpha (1----4) beta galactose containing receptors and had laboratory evidence of inflammation. Another group of 11 children were distinguished with strictly defined bacteriuria and concomitant disease. These children were infected with nonattaching bacteria and had lower concentrations of C-reactive protein in serum and lower microsedimentation rates than the major group. Five of these children had a reduction in renal concentrating capacity. The study emphasizes the heterogeneity among patients with fever and bacteriuria but does not rule out the possibility of renal involvement in any subgroup.\r"

Overall case fatality was 10%, ranging from 9% in the period 1957 to 1963, to 16% in the period 1980 to 1987 (P = 0.15). The percent of patients admitted with severe disease increased from 14% to 38% (P = 0.001). When stratified by disease severity, case-fatality rates did not change with time. We conclude that technologic advances of the past 30 years had no measurable impact on mortality from meningococcal infection in our hospital and that crude case-fatality rates can be misleading if disease severity is not considered.\r"

Educational programs foster client participation in selecting appropriate modes of learning activities as they relate to the recovery process and help the client and family make a smooth transition into community living. Varied modes of instruction may be used, including practice sessions, group learning activities, computerized programs, use of videos as well as printed resources. The role of the nurse as educator coupled with a broad range of teaching strategies provides the client and family effective tools to make ongoing changes related to their functional abilities. The role of the rehabilitation nurse as an educator is an evolving one. No longer is the nurse practicing in a rehabilitative setting, whether it be inpatient or community based, guaranteed what appeared to be unending time to conduct educational programs. Past constraints, shortened stays, the client assuming an earlier role as a self-care agent, the focus on wellness, disabled individuals mainstreaming into community life, greater family involvement in rehabilitation efforts, and increased use of paraprofessionals force the nurse to strengthen and clarify her role as educator. Nurses need to value their teaching role as an integral part of the team effort. Strategies include scheduling teaching time with clients and families, recording activities and outcomes, discussing educational issues with other disciplines, and designing and promoting an environment that is conducive to learning.\r"

Both the human muscle and hepatic glycogen signals can be detected definitively with a time resolution of approximately equal to 13 min. A 1H/13C concentric surface coil was used. The 1H outer coil was 11 cm in diameter; the 13C inner coil was 8 cm in diameter. The coils were tuned to 89.3 MHz and 22.4 MHz, respectively. The 1H coil was used for optimizing field homogeneity (shimming) the magnet and for single-frequency decoupling of the C1 glycogen signal. Total power deposition from both the transmitter pulse and the continuous wave decoupling did not exceed the Food and Drug Administration guideline of 8 W/kg of tissue. Experiments were done for which healthy subjects returned to the magnets at different times for 13C NMR measurement. The spectral difference between experiments was within the noise in the C1 glycogen region. Because of the spectral reproducibility and the signal sensitivity, hepatic glycogen repletion can be followed. Four hours postprandial, hepatic glycogen increases by 3.8 times from the basal fasted state. The hepatic glycogen data correspond directly to previous biopsy results and support the use of 13C NMR as a noninvasive probe of human metabolism.\r"

Two overlapping clones with insert lengths of 1.3 and 1.5 kilobases were isolated. The sequence of a 1629-base-pair (bp) cDNA was obtained, with an open reading frame (nucleotides 81-1610) encoding a P-450 protein of 509 residues (Mr = 58,738). The insect P-450 protein contains a hydrophobic NH2 terminus and a 22-residue cysteine-containing fragment near the COOH terminus that is known to bind the heme; both of these features have been found in the more than five dozen vertebrate P-450 proteins of which the sequences are presently known. Interestingly, the termination codon UAA may be contained in a putative polyadenylylation signal (AAUAAA) of the mRNA. This P-450 protein exhibits the most similarity (27% amino acid positional identity) with mammalian proteins of the P450III family but qualifies as a member of another family, which we propose to designate the P450VI gene family. This cDNA and deduced protein sequence should provide important information in the study of evolution of the P-450 gene superfamily, as well as provide an important probe for studying the regulation of insect P-450 and understanding the molecular genetics of insecticide resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Purified testicular and ovarian luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptors are phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). Occupancy of the receptors by hCG significantly increased the rate but not the extent of phosphorylation. However, prolonged preincubation of receptors with hCG reduced the subsequent rate of receptor phosphorylation. Identical phosphopeptide maps were obtained for the phosphorylated ovarian and testicular receptors. The phosphorylated receptor, like the native receptor, bound to wheat germ lectin and hCG-Sepharose and migrated as a single band of Mr 90,000 (testis) and Mr 85,000 (ovary) on NaDodSO4/PAGE. Neuraminidase treatment of receptors caused reductions of molecular weight to 82,000 (testis) and 77,000 (ovary), and further treatment with O-Glycanase had minimal effect on molecular size. However, deglycosylation with N-Glycosidase and endoglycosidase F produced a single labeled polypeptide of Mr 59,000 for both gonadal receptors. Treatment of native receptors with neuraminidase caused no apparent change in binding of gonadotropin to blotted receptors, whereas deglycosylated receptors showed a major reduction in hormone binding. These results indicate that luteinizing hormone/hCG receptors are sialoglycoproteins with predominantly N-linked glycosyl residues that account for the size difference between testicular and ovarian receptors and that may participate in the interaction with gonadotropin. Receptor occupancy by agonist leads to a conformational change that facilitates its phosphorylation during initial binding and reduces the rate of phosphorylation after more prolonged exposure to hCG.\r"

The three-dimensional structure of the native enzyme has been solved at 3.0-A resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacement method and refined at 2.8-A resolution to a crystallographic R factor of 0.194. A total of 316 of 335 residues, omitting disordered regions 1-5 and 54-67, have been built into the monomer, which has average dimensions of about 30 A by 50 A by 35 A. Four monomeric units aggregate into a molecular tetramer with D2 symmetry, which approximates a disk about 35 A thick. Each monomer consists of about 33% alpha-helix, 23% beta-strand, and 6% beta-turn. Four sites for Fru-2,6-P2 and two major sites for AMP binding per tetramer have been identified by difference Fourier techniques. The binding site for Fru-2,6-P2 is shared by two neighboring monomers and consists of side-chain atoms of Asn-212, Tyr-244, Tyr-264, and Lys-274; backbone atoms of Gly-246 through Met-248; and only Arg-243 from the adjacent subunit. In addition, Asn-125, Tyr-215, and Lys-269 are located within a distance of about 5 A of Fru-2,6-P2. A negatively charged pocket near this binding site includes Asp-118, Asp-121, Glu-280, Glu-97, and Glu-98. The AMP binding site is located near Val-17, Gln-20, Gly-21, Ala-24 through Met-30, Lys-112, Tyr-113, Arg-140, and Met-177.\r"

The binding of the protein to the affinity column was prevented by free [D-Trp8]SRIF or the stable SRIF analogue SMS 201-996 but not by the inactive somatostatin 28-(1-14). The purified receptor could be covalently labeled by the 125I-labeled SRIF analogue CGP 23996. Excess [D-Trp8]SRIF blocked the binding of 125I-labeled CGP 23996 to the purified receptor, but somatostatin 28-(1-14) did not affect the binding. A 60-kDa protein was also purified from the anterior pituitary cell line AtT-20, which has a high expression of SRIF receptors. In contrast, no 60-kDa protein could be purified from CHO cells, which have no detectable SRIF receptors. These findings present evidence for the purification of the SRIF receptor.\r"

The assay system consisted of the giant internodal cells of an alga, Nitellopsis obtusa, which contain well-organized arrays of actin filaments (actin cables) running along the cell long axis, and a glass microneedle (tip diameter, approximately 7 microns; elastic coefficient, approximately 40 pN/microns), which was coated with skeletal muscle myosin at the tip and extended from a micromanipulator at right angles with the actin cables. When the myosin-coated tip of the microneedle was brought into contact with the exposed surface of the actin cables, it exhibited ATP-dependent movement along the actin cables over a distance of 20-150 microns in 20-200 s (20-23 degrees C) and eventually stopped due to a balance between forces generated by the actin-myosin interaction (800-6000 pN) and by the bent microneedle. Since the load on the force-generating myosin molecules increased with the bending displacement of the microneedle (auxotonic condition), the relation between the load and the sliding velocity of the myosin heads past the actin cables was determined from the time course of the microneedle movement recorded with a video system. The shape of the force-velocity curve thus obtained was convex upwards, similar to that of the force-velocity curve of intact frog muscle fibers obtained under the auxotonic condition.\r"

We find that the electrostatic work of assembly is dominated by unfavorable changes in dipole-solvent interactions rather than by favorable interactions between antiparallel helices. Furthermore, the electrostatic energy difference between the observed arrangement of helices in hemerythrin and at least one other possible helical arrangement is less than 1 kT. These results suggest that the helix dipole actually destabilizes the helical bundle and that it plays little or no role in producing the observed bundle geometry.\r"

The deduced 37-amino acid sequence of the immunoreactive 4-kDa polypeptide is 100% and 86% conserved in the respective similar open reading frames encoded by Nicotiana tabacum and Marchantia chloroplast DNA. The 4-kDa polypeptide is present in both etioplasts and chloroplasts of maize and is found as well in spinach, tobacco, pea, wheat, and rice thylakoids. Similar to the other subunits of the b6-f complex, it is intrinsic to the membrane, and its hydrophilic COOH terminus is located at the stromal thylakoid surface. We propose to call the 4-kDa polypeptide \"subunit 5\" and the chloroplast gene that encodes it the petE gene.\r"

We have used a fusing skeletal muscle cell line, C2, to examine the endogenous expression of one peptide, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), and its receptor during differentiation. The synthesis of IGF-II is low during proliferation of myoblasts; IGF-II mRNA can be detected only through use of a highly sensitive solution-hybridization assay. Competition binding studies reveal that the IGF-II receptor is similarly nonabundant in myoblasts. During differentiation IGF-II mRNA rises rapidly. A nearly 4-fold increase is seen within 16 hr of onset of the differentiation process, and levels are 25 times higher than those in myoblasts by 96 hr, when myotubes have formed and muscle-specific alpha-actin mRNAs are synthesized. IGF-II accumulates in conditioned culture medium with similar kinetics. The expression of IGF-II receptors on the cell surface increases almost 6-fold 24 hr after the onset of differentiation and remains high. These studies suggest that IGF-II and its receptor are coordinately regulated during myogenic differentiation in C2 cells and that IGF-II may be an autocrine factor for skeletal muscle.\r"

Two microtubule-based motors were previously identified by examining plastic beads induced to move along microtubules by cytosol fractions from the squid giant axon: (i) an anterograde motor, kinesin, and (ii) a retrograde motor, which is characterized here. The retrograde motor, a cytosolic protein previously termed HMW1, was purified from optic lobes and extruded axoplasm by nucleotide-dependent microtubule affinity and release; microtubule gliding was used as the assay of motor activity. The following properties of the retrograde motor suggest that it is cytoplasmic dynein: (i) sedimentation at 20-22 S with a heavy chain of Mr greater than 200,000 that coelectrophoreses with the alpha and beta subunits of axonemal dynein, (ii) cleavage by UV irradiation in the presence of ATP and vanadate, and (iii) a molecular structure resembling two-headed dynein from axonemes. Furthermore, bead movement toward the minus end of microtubules was blocked when axoplasmic supernatants were treated with UV/vanadate. Treatment of axoplasmic supernatant with UV/vanadate also blocks the retrograde movement of purified organelles in vitro without changing the number of anterograde moving organelles, indicating that dynein interacts specifically with a subgroup of organelles programmed to move toward the cell body. However, purified optic lobe dynein, like purified kinesin, does not by itself promote the movement of purified organelles along microtubules, suggesting that additional axoplasmic factors are necessary for retrograde as well as anterograde transport.\r"

The protein that binds to the overriding element is C/EBP, a liver-enriched transcription factor, whereas the newly identified protein that is responsible for full liver-specific enhancer activity is found in HeLa cell and spleen extracts as well as in extracts prepared from the liver. This latter protein may therefore be an example of a widely distributed protein that because of cell-specific modification or interaction has a tissue-specific, positive action on transcription.\r"

During liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats, TGF-alpha mRNA increased; it reached a maximum (approximately 9-fold higher than normal) at the peak of DNA synthesis. The message and the peptide were localized in hepatocytes and found in higher amounts in hepatocytes obtained from regenerating liver. TGF-alpha caused a 13-fold elevation of DNA synthesis in hepatocytes in primary culture and was slightly more effective than epidermal growth factor. TGF-beta blocked TGF-alpha stimulation when added either simultaneously with TGF-alpha or a day later. TGF-alpha message increased in hepatocytes stimulated to undergo DNA synthesis by TGF-alpha or epidermal growth factor, and the peptide was detected in the culture medium by RIA. In the regenerating liver, the increase in TGF-alpha mRNA during the first day after partial hepatectomy coincided with an increase in epidermal growth factor/TGF-alpha receptor mRNA and a decrease (already reported) in the number of these receptors. We conclude that TGF-alpha may function as a physiological inducer of hepatocyte DNA synthesis during liver regeneration by means of an autocrine mechanism and that its stimulatory effects in this growth process are balanced by the inhibitory action of TGF-beta 1.\r"

IEC-6 cell growth is markedly inhibited by TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 with half-maximal inhibition occurring between 0.1 and 1.0 ng of TGF-beta 1 per ml. TGF-beta 1-mediated growth inhibition is not associated with the appearance of biochemical markers of enterocyte differentiation such as alkaline phosphatase expression and sucrase activity. TGF-beta 1 (10 ng/ml) increases steady-state levels of its own mRNA expression within 8 hr of treatment of rapidly growing IEC-6 cells. In freshly isolated rat jejunal enterocytes that are sequentially eluted from the crypt villus axis, TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression is most abundant in terminally differentiated villus tip cells and least abundant in the less differentiated, mitotically active crypt cells. We conclude that TGF-beta 1 is an autoregulated growth inhibitor in IEC-6 cells that potentially functions in an autocrine manner. In the rat jejunal epithelium, TGF-beta 1 expression is most prominently localized to the villus tip--i.e., the region of the crypt villus unit that is characterized by the terminally differentiated phenotype. These data suggest that TGF-beta 1 may function in coordination of the rapid cell turnover typical for the intestinal epithelium.\r"

Mitochondrial content was estimated by standard morphometry. The surface area of mitochondrial inner membranes per unit volume of mitochondria was estimated by a stereological method. The respiratory activities of isolated mitochondria were measured biochemically, using pyruvate/malate, glutamate/malate, succinate, or cytochrome c as substrate. Structurally and functionally, mitochondria from the three muscle types showed nearly identical characteristics. Oxidative activity was dependent on substrate; with succinate, 5.8 ml of O2 per min per ml of mitochondria was the rate most likely to represent physiological conditions. Oxidative activities of 3.1 ml.min-1.ml-1 with pyruvate/malate and 14.5 ml.min-1.ml-1 with cytochrome c as substrates were theoretical lower and upper bounds. The oxidative capacity of each of the three muscles was thus in direct proportion to the total volume of mitochondria in the muscle. The respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria was very near to the maximal oxygen uptake rate of mitochondria that is commonly estimated in intact muscles of a wide variety of animals.\r"

  ".W": "The pivotal role that protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play in the growth regulation of eukaryotic cells is manifest in the frequent appearance of members of the PTK family as growth factor receptors or as the transforming agents of acutely transforming retroviruses. A feature common to all members of the PTK family is a highly conserved catalytic domain which is characteristic of the group as a whole and whose activity appears to be tightly regulated within the cell by other domains of the PTK. Degenerate oligonucleotide probes corresponding to two invariant amino acid sequence motifs within the catalytic domains of all PTK family members were synthesized and employed in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNA sequences between them. An M13 PCR library was produced in this way from cDNA prepared against mRNA from the murine hemopoietic cell line FDC-P1. The PCR library was then screened by DNA sequencing for PTK-related sequences. Two sequences were identified that, on the basis of sequence comparison with known PTKs, may encode representatives of a new class of PTK.\r"

Three lines are producing IgG antibody to the 41-kDa HIV transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 and 4 produce IgG antibodies to the 24-kDa HIV core protein p24, its precursors and a breakdown product.

Conduction failure was consistently found in the sciatic-tibial nerve during 1- and 3-hr ischemic periods. Recovery of the compound muscle action potential was prompt and complete upon reperfusion following 1 hr of ischemia. However, after 3 hr of ischemia, recovery in the proximal portion of the sciatic nerve was less than 10%, and conduction block occurred in the distal portion of the nerve. Nerve blood flow was restored to only 55% and 45% of resting values following 1 and 3 hr, respectively, of ischemia and did not recover even after 2 hr of reperfusion. The blood-nerve barrier was not statistically impaired to the passage of [14C]sucrose following 1 hr of ischemia but was significantly impaired after 3 hr of ischemia. The permeability-surface area product was consistently greater following 1 hr of reperfusion than during the immediate reperfusion period. These data indicate that severe ischemia of peripheral nerve results in reperfusion injury, conduction block, and blood-nerve barrier disruption. Microvascular events, which may occur during reperfusion, may be important in amplifying the nerve fiber damage that began during ischemia.\r"

Nonterminal differentiation also induces simian virus 40-transformed 3T3 T cells to repress expression of the large tumor antigen and to revert to a nontransformed state. Although the molecular mechanisms that mediate these and other forms of anticancer activity have not been definitively established, data are presented which suggest that differentiation-induced repression of large tumor antigen expression can be regulated at the level of transcription and/or RNA processing.\r"

Adenosine, inorganic phosphate, and inorganic pyrophosphate were without such effects under identical conditions. Daily intraperitoneal injections of adenine nucleotides in large volumes of saline, starting after the tumors became palpable, resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and a few \"cures.\" The treatment was not toxic to the host as determined by changes in body weights. Weight loss observed in animals upon progression of the fast-growing CT26 tumors was slowed markedly in adenine nucleotide-treated mice. The inhibition of weight loss in tumor-bearing mice was shown to be neither the cause nor the effect of the inhibition of tumor growth. Intraperitoneal injections of AMP or ATP but not of adenosine yielded expansions of erythrocyte ATP pools in host animals. The expanded erythrocyte ATP pools are stable over a period of hours, while slowly releasing micromolar amounts of ATP into the blood plasma compartment, leading to several-fold increases in plasma (extracellular) ATP levels. Based on previous studies in which 1-5 microM extracellular ATP effectively inhibited the growth of a variety of tumor cells in several in vitro systems, it is suggested that similar levels of ATP in blood plasma account for the anticancer activities observed in a murine host.\r"

The Miyayama strain of Ehrlichia sennetsu and the Maryland and Illinois strains of Ehrlichia risticii were cultivated in a mouse macrophage cell line, separated from host cell constituents by procedures that included Renografin or Percoll gradient centrifugation, and tested after cryopreservation. Cells incubated without a metabolizing substrate contained little, if any, ATP. When the Ehrlichia cells were incubated for 1 hr at 34 degrees C with glutamine, significant amounts of ATP were detected. The amounts of ATP attained with glutamine were decreased in some instances by the addition of atractyloside, an inhibitor of adenine nucleotide translocase in mitochondria, and were decreased consistently and to a greater extent by 2,4-dinitrophenol. When ATP, instead of glutamine, was added to the ehrlichiae, upon incubation the amount of ATP was markedly decreased. Comparable responses under all these conditions were obtained with Rickettsia typhi, although the final ATP levels were higher. Control preparations derived from uninfected mouse macrophages or from the discards of the Ehrlichia purification procedures contained negligible amounts of ATP, which were not increased by incubation with glutamine. We conclude that with respect to ATP metabolism, the monocytic Ehrlichia resemble Rickettsia more closely than Chlamydia, even though Ehrlichia resemble Chlamydia in their intracellular location in the phagosomes and in possibly having a developmental cycle.\r"

Data analysis algorithms using signal averaging techniques were developed to improve the time resolution of the measured calcium changes. As previously reported, calcium oscillations were detected from all regions of the neuropil but not from the soma or axon. In some cells step increases in intracellular neuropil calcium were correlated with each of the action potentials in the burst (on the peak of the voltage oscillation). In other cells we observed calcium oscillations phase-locked to the membrane potential with no spike-related component. A few cells had both spike-evoked and graded potential components to the calcium oscillations. In those cells, the spatial distribution of the spike-correlated calcium influx differed from that of the voltage-oscillation-correlated calcium influx, suggesting that different neurites might interact with their postsynaptic targets with different mixtures of graded and spike-correlated transmitter release.\r"

  ".W": "A Ca2+-channel blocker derived from funnel-web spider toxin (FTX) has made it possible to define and study the ionic channels responsible for the Ca2+ conductance in mammalian Purkinje cell neurons and the preterminal in squid giant synapse. In cerebellar slices, FTX blocked Ca2+-dependent spikes in Purkinje cells, reduced the spike afterpotential hyperpolarization, and increased the Na+-dependent plateau potential. In the squid giant synapse, FTX blocked synaptic transmission without affecting the presynaptic action potential. Presynaptic voltage-clamp results show blockage of the inward Ca2+ current and of transmitter release. FTX was used to isolate channels from cerebellum and squid optic lobe. The isolated product was incorporated into black lipid membranes and was analyzed by using patch-clamp techniques. The channel from cerebellum exhibited a 10- to 12-pS conductance in 80 mM Ba2+ and 5-8 pS in 100 mM Ca2+ with voltage-dependent open probabilities and kinetics. High Ba2+ concentrations at the cytoplasmic side of the channel increased the average open time from 1 to 3 msec to more than 1 sec. A similar channel was also isolated from squid optic lobe. However, its conductance was higher in Ba2+, and the maximum opening probability was about half of that derived from cerebellar tissue and also was sensitive to high cytoplasmic Ba2+. Both channels were blocked by FTX, Cd2+, and Co2+ but were not blocked by omega-conotoxin or dihydropyridines. These results suggest that one of the main Ca2+ conductances in mammalian neurons and in the squid preterminal represents the activation of a previously undefined class of Ca2+ channel. We propose that it be termed the \"P\" channel, as it was first described in Purkinje cells.\r"

  ".W": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI), induces myoclonic seizures in rats when injected into the deep prepyriform cortex at concentrations lower than those that induce convulsions from the amygdala, hippocampus, or neocortex. This observation prompted the suggestion that the deep prepyriform cortex was responsible for seizure generation regardless of the neurotransmitter and neuronal circuits involved. Bilateral intrastriatal application of BMI protects rats against seizures induced by (i) local application of BMI into the deep prepyriform cortex and (ii) systemic application of bicuculline, pilocarpine (a cholinergic agonist), or kainic acid (a glutamate receptor agonist). The region of the striatum sensitive to the previously unknown anticonvulsant action of BMI is located in the immediate vicinity of the deep prepyriform cortex and is 100-150 times more sensitive to the anticonvulsant action relative to the sensitivity of the deep prepyriform cortex to the convulsant action of BMI. These data suggest a powerful gamma-aminobutyric acid-dependent gating role of the basal ganglia in determining the seizure threshold in the forebrain. This argues against the suggestion that the deep prepyriform cortex plays a crucial role in the generation of seizures following systemic administration of convulsants. The discovery of an anticonvulsant action of BMI in the rat striatum contradicts the gamma-aminobutyric acid theory of epilepsy, which implies that deficits in the gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition in the central nervous system lead to the emergence of seizures.\r"

The neuronal firing pattern is tightly correlated with the phase and amplitude of an oscillatory local field potential recorded through the same electrode. The amplitude of the local field-potential oscillations are maximal in response to stimuli that match the orientation and direction preference of the local cluster of neurons. Single and multiunit recordings from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus showed no evidence of oscillations of the neuronal firing probability in the range of 20-70 Hz. The results demonstrate that local neuronal populations in the visual cortex engage in stimulus-specific synchronous oscillations resulting from an intracortical mechanism. The oscillatory responses may provide a general mechanism by which activity patterns in spatially separate regions of the cortex are temporally coordinated.\r"

The signal-to-noise ratio can be adjusted in a biological neural network by neuromodulators such as norepinephrine. Comparisons are made to experimental results and further investigations are suggested to test the effects of hysteresis and neuromodulation in pattern recognition and learning.

By using rapid-freezing and cryofracture techniques in the electric organ of Torpedo, synaptic transmission was found to be accompanied by significant changes affecting the postsynaptic membrane for a few milliseconds. In the replicas, the protoplasmic leaflet of this membrane was seen to contain intramembrane particles (IMPs) of two different forms, globular and elongated. Globular IMPs had a mean diameter of 8.8 nm; they were the most frequently found (80% in unstimulated specimens). Elongated IMPs had a major diameter of 17.9 nm, about twice that of globular IMPs. Transmission of a single nerve impulse was accompanied by a marked decrease in the number of globular IMPs and by an increase in the number of elongated IMPs, as if there were a coalescence of two adjacent round particles to form an elongated one. These changes started soon after the electrical stimulus and lasted for approximately 3 ms. IMPs in the postsynaptic protoplasmic face are thought to correspond to a certain proportion of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that were extracted with this leaflet during the fracture process. The phenomenon described here reflects an abrupt change in the membrane, probably linked to activation of the acetylcholine nicotinic receptors.\r"

We now report that APB is a potent antagonist of cone-driven horizontal cells in the goldfish retina. APB hyperpolarized the membrane to the same potential as cobalt Ringer's and blocked the light responses. APB acted specifically on the cone pathway, as it had no effect on rod-driven horizontal cells. The lowest effective APB concentration for antagonistic action on the horizontal cells (approximately 2 microM) was similar to the concentration for agonist action on DBCs. APB was not able to block the actions of exogenous glutamate or kainate on horizontal cells. We propose that the action of APB on the cone-horizontal cell synapse is mediated at a site that is distinct from the glutamate and kainate binding site. Therefore, APB is most probably acting at a different locus on the synaptic glutamatergic receptors of the horizontal cells or at presynaptic receptors located on the cones themselves.\r"

In cell-attached patches from Necturus proximal tubule, the short-open-time K+ channel at the basolateral membrane could be stretch-activated by pipette suction, where a negative pressure of 6 cm H2O (588.6 Pa) was sufficient to increase the open probability of the channel by a factor of 4.0 +/- 0.8 (n = 7 tubules). A 50% reduction in bath osmolarity increased cell volume by 66 +/- 10% and increased the K+-channel open probability by a factor of 5.8 +/- 1.4 (n = 7) in the same cell-attached patches that were activated by pipette suction. A kinetic analysis indicates one open state and at least two closed states for this epithelial K+ channel. Both suction and swelling shorten the longest time constant of the closed-time distribution by a factor of 3, without significant effect on either the mean open time or the shorter closed-state time constant. The similar effect of suction and swelling is consistent with the hypothesis that stretch-activated K+ channels mediate the increase in macroscopic K+ conductance that occurs during osmoregulation of amphibian proximal tubules. Calculations based on a simple model indicate that small increments in cell volume could produce statistically significant increases in K+-channel activity.\r"

Eukaryotic cells are equipped with a DNA-binding protein that selectively recognizes cruciform DNA. Biochemical and immunological data showed that this protein is HMG1, an evolutionarily conserved, essential, and abundant component of the nucleus. The interaction with a ubiquitous protein points to a critical role for cruciform DNA conformations.\r"

  ".W": "In Drosophila, five \"terminal\" polarity genes must be active in females in order for them to produce embryos with normal anterior and posterior ends. Hypoactivity mutations in one such gene, torso, result in the loss of the most posterior domain of fushi tarazu expression and the terminal cuticular structures. In contrast, a torso hyperactivity mutation causes the loss of central fushi tarazu expression and central cuticular structures. Cytoplasmic leakage, transplantation, and temperature-shift experiments suggest that the latter effect is caused by abnormal persistence of the torso product in the central region of the embryo during early development. Thus, the amount and timing of torso activity is key to distinguishing the central and terminal regions of the embryo. Mutations in the tailless terminal gene act as dominant maternal suppressors of the hyperactive torso allele, indicating that the torso product acts through, or in concert with, the tailless product.\r"

This last effect reduces the probability of a channel being open from about 10(-1) at 5 microM to less than 10(-5) at 10 microM gadolinium. Calcium has effects on open time and current similar to that of gadolinium, but this channel is permeable to calcium and calcium does not completely inhibit channel activity. The availability of a blocker for SA ion channels may help to define their physiological function, and will simplify the use of oocytes as an expression system for ion channels.\r"

The antibodies were produced by immunizing with a Co(III) triethylenetetramine (trien)-peptide hapten. These antibodies as a group are capable of binding trien complexes of not only Co(III) but also of numerous other metals. Six peptides were examined as possible substrates with the antibodies and various metal complexes. Two of these peptides were cleaved by several of the antibodies. One antibody was studied in detail, and cleavage was observed for the substrates with the trien complexes of Zn(II), Ga(III), Fe(III), In(III), Cu(II), Ni(II), Lu(III), Mg(II), or Mn(II) as cofactors. A turnover number of 6 x 10(-4) per second was observed for these substrates. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the use of cofactor-assisted catalysis in an antibody binding site to accomplish difficult chemical transformations.\r"

The vectors were self-replicating and gene expression was efficient and rapid; up to 10(8) CAT polypeptides were produced per infected cell in 16 to 20 hours. CAT expression could be made temperature-sensitive by means of a derivative that incorporated a temperature-sensitive mutation in viral RNA synthesis. Vector genomic RNAs were packaged into infectious particles when Sindbis helper virus was used to supply virion structural proteins. The vector RNAs were stable to at least seven cycles of infection. The expression of CAT increased about 10(3)-fold, despite a 10(15)-fold dilution during the passaging. Sindbis virus vectors should prove useful for expressing large quantities of gene products in a variety of animal cells.\r"

A complementary DNA encoding a gap junction present in Xenopus oocytes and early embryos has now been cloned and sequenced. This protein sequence is homologous to the well-characterized gap junction structural proteins rat connexin32 and connexin43. RNA blot analysis of total Xenopus oocyte RNA showed hybridization to a single 1.6-kilobase band. This messenger RNA is abundant in oocytes, decreases to levels below the sensitivity of our assay by stage 15 (18 hours), and is not detectable in RNA from a number of adult organs. To confirm that the oocyte cDNA encodes a gap junction channel, the protein was over expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of RNA synthesized in vitro. Pairs of RNA-injected oocytes formed many more time- and voltage-sensitive cell-cell channels than water-injected pairs.\r"

  ".W": "A strategy, termed homolog-scanning mutagenesis, was used to identify the epitopes on human growth hormone (hGH) for binding to its cloned liver receptor and eight different monoclonal antibodies (Mab's). Segments of sequences (7 to 30 residues long) that were derived from homologous hormones known not to bind to the hGH receptor or Mab's, were systematically substituted throughout the hGH gene to produce a set of 17 chimeric hormones. Each Mab or receptor was categorized by a particular subset of mutant hormones was categorized by a particular subset of mutant hormones that disrupted binding. Each subset of the disruptive mutations mapped within close proximity on a three-dimensional model of hGH, even though the residues changed within each subset were usually distant in the primary sequence. The mapping analysis correctly predicted those Mab's which could or could not block binding of the receptor to hGH and further suggested (along with other data) that the folding of these chimeric hormones is like that of HGH. By this analysis, three discontinuous polypeptide determinants in hGH--the loop between residues 54 and 74, the central portion of helix 4 to the carboxyl terminus, and to a lesser extent the amino-terminal region of helix 1--modulate binding to the liver receptor. Homolog-scanning mutagenesis should be of general use in identifying sequences that cause functional variation among homologous proteins.\r"

During the catch state, however, [Ca2+]i was effectively at its resting level and was unaffected by 5-hydroxytryptamine, which induced a rapid relaxation from catch. The results indicate that a maintained high [Ca2+]i is not required for the maintenance of catch tension in intact ABRM and that there was no significant change in [Ca2+]i upon abolition of catch.\r"

Attendees of workshops were more confident in their ability to recognize abuse and less likely to think they could best handle the case themselves. Male physicians were reluctant to report because of the likelihood of having to appear in court. All physicians were reluctant to report cases about which they were uncertain and were concerned about the lack of prompt action after their reports; general practitioners expressed reluctance to report due to a wide variety of factors.\r"

Large pericardial effusions occurred in 13 patients; three had complete circumcardiac pericardial effusion, four had local anterior adhesions, five had extensive anterior adhesions (posterior loculated effusion), and one had a large loculated pericardial effusion contiguous to the right atrium. In five patients with tamponade, the effusion was drained, with immediate reversal of symptoms and signs of tamponade. In the other eight patients, who had no deterioration in cardiovascular status, the effusion was not drained; instead, these patients were treated medically with indomethacin and observed with serial echocardiograms, and the effusions eventually disappeared. The most consistent echocardiographic differences between the five patients with and the eight patients without tamponade were that patients with tamponade had larger posterior pericardial effusions, more severe left atrial compression, and more indentation of the right atrial wall. Echocardiography plays an essential role in diagnosis and management of large pericardial effusions after open heart surgery. Patients with large pericardial effusions who are clinically stable need only medical management, including serial echocardiograms, but drainage is indicated if the cardiovascular or respiratory status worsens. Certain echocardiographic findings indicate a high probability of tamponade.\r"

The most frequent cardiac conditions for evaluation were congestive heart failure, old myocardial infarctions, murmurs, abnormal electrocardiograms, angina, and previous histories of coronary artery bypass surgery.

Fifteen patients had peritoneal implants at initial surgical exploration; 14 had tumor recurrence and had at least one reoperation. Five-year survival was 16% overall and 37% for patients without peritoneal implants at the initial procedure. This figure includes five patients in whom distant metastases developed after benign gastric or intestinal leiomyoma was diagnosed based on histologic and gross findings. All patients who have had five-year cures or more than two years of palliation after demonstration of peritoneal metastases had operation after 1978, a finding that probably reflects a more aggressive surgical approach to these tumors. Effective palliation, defined as three months of symptom relief and six-month survival in patients with widespread intraperitoneal tumor, was achieved significantly more often when the tumor causing the symptom was resected (eight of eight patients) than when it was not (five of six patients). These data indicate that an aggressive surgical approach is warranted in attempts to achieve either cure or palliation in patients with intra-abdominal leiomyosarcoma.\r"

During the study, 185 patients with alcoholic liver disease were hospitalized 378 times at the VA Medical Center, Long Beach, California. Physicians ordered liver panels (including serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase, glutamic pyruvate transaminase, and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) an average of 7.4 times per hospitalization. Increased biochemical testing did not decrease length of stay or improve clinical outcomes such as development of complications or survival of hospitalization. Since the treatment of alcoholic liver disease is largely supportive and not dependent upon frequent biochemical testing, we recommend that these tests be ordered only when patients are admitted to or discharged from the hospital, and when there has been a clinical change.\r"

In four cases chest x-ray films revealed air block or hyperinflation and led to further diagnostic tests. The definitive diagnostic methods included esophagogram in 15 cases, aortography in 14 cases, two-dimensional echocardiography in one case, and esophagoscopy/bronchoscopy in eight cases. Presenting symptoms were respiratory in 13 cases and feeding difficulties in three; one asymptomatic case was found incidentally. Four cases of air block syndrome were observed as an early and unusual presentation of vascular ring in infants. Hyperinflation of the lung fields on chest x-ray film should spur suspicion of a possible vascular ring. Two case reports are included to demonstrate air block in relation to vascular rings in neonates.\r"

Maneuvers investigated were breast examination, pelvic examination and Pap smear, rectal examination in men, mammogram, stool guaiac test, and blood glucose determination. A nurse reviewed the charts and used a list in the front of each chart to prompt residents in the experimental group. Residents in the control group were not prompted. A significant improvement (P less than .05) in performance was seen in the prompted group. Performance of rectal examination and mammograms improved most, increasing from 41% to 93% and 18% to 64%, respectively. There were no significant changes in the control group. This simple nurse-initiated prompting system improved the performance of health promotion and disease prevention maneuvers.\r"

Of a total of 255 nurses, 199 were assessed for their skill in patient-handling. One-half (control group) received traditional training in patient-handling, and the other half (trained group) received a curriculum of instruction totaling 40 hours. The skills of both groups were assessed on graduation. The control group was rated as less competent in patient-handling. Nurses in both groups were questioned about the prevalence of back pain and incidence of back injuries in the first year after graduation. In multiple regression analysis, the major risk indicators for back injuries were poor patient-handling skill, low numbers of repetitions in the sit-up test, and high work-load scores. High score on the hysteria scale of Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire was a risk indicator for all kinds of back pain. Though back pain was independent of patient-handling skill, those rated as \"bad\" or \"poor\" had more back injuries (24%) than those who had been rated as \"good\" or \"excellent\" (2%) (P less than 0.001), but the difference between the trained and control groups was not statistically significant. It was concluded that back injuries may be prevented by the teaching of patient-handling skills.\r"

Three patients were admitted but refused to participate in the treatment program. Initial demographic, physical, and self-assessment attributes were similar for all four groups. At year's end, 81% of program graduates, 40% of the dropouts, and 29% of those denied the program had returned to work. All six crossover patients were working 6 months after treatment. Program graduates showed significant improvements in self-assessed pain, disability, and depression, and in physical capacities after 3 weeks of treatment. These improvements were maintained through the year except for partial decreases in frequent lifting, cycling endurance, and isokinetic trunk extension strength. Functional restoration with behavioral support is an effective treatment for patients with chronic, disabling low-back pain, as measured by self-assessments, physical capacities, and return to work.\r"

Thus, a datum is established in which to demonstrate variation with location and relationships between properties of different tissues. Results of the chemical analyses show a change in composition through the end-plate with that at the outer annulus and nearer the bone, having higher collagen but lower proteoglycan and water contents, than the end-plate nearest the disc at the nucleus. Histology demonstrated numerous disruptions along the end-plate, with Schmorl's nodes being present in several specimens. Where these occurred, the disc, and in some cases the end-plate, showed loss of proteoglycan compared with the surrounding tissue.\r"

The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligament normally operate in the elastic part of their stress-strain curve. Destruction of the intervertebral disc leads to a dislocation of the centers of rotation in the motion segment. Two types of facet joint capsules were observed. Height reduction in the motion segment leads to abnormal strains in one type sooner than in the other, which can be normalized by slight flexion. Injection of a silicone compound into the disc normalizes many of the changes in the motion segment due to height reduction.\r"

From the transverse scans, the position and cross-sectional areas of the muscles of the lumbar region were recorded. Regression analysis was performed to relate these values to trunk measurements and body weight. Sagittal scans were used to measure the angles to the vertical of the lumbar discs and of the skin overlying the spinous processes. The position of each lumbar disc relative to two skin points was measured. These parameters can then be used in biochemical calculations of low-back forces.\r"

  ".W": "The human spinal column, devoid of musculature, is incapable of carrying normal physiologic loads. In an in vitro experiment, the effect of simulated intersegmental muscle forces on spinal instability was investigated. Intact and sequentially injured fresh lumbar functional spinal units were subjected to three-dimensional biomechanical tests with increasing muscle forces. With the application of muscle forces, range of motion (ROM) increased and neutral zone (NZ) decreased in flexion loading, while both ROM and NZ decreased in extension loading. In lateral bending, ROM and NZ were unaffected by the application of the muscle forces. In axial rotation, ROM decreased significantly, while NZ decrease was statistically insignificant. It was concluded that the action of the intersegmental muscle forces is to maintain or decrease intervertebral motions after injury, with the exception of the flexion ROM, which increased with the application of muscle forces. In addition, the study suggested that Neutral Zone is a better indicator of spinal instability than Range of Motion.\r"

Compressive failure usually occurred in the vertebral body, but in three cases, the disc prolapsed into the vertebral canal; these discs came from three of the four most physically active individuals. It is concluded that physical activity strengthens both the vertebrae and the discs. A high level of activity can cause vertebral strength to exceed that of the discs.\r"

These were also the most frequent indications for reoperation in 20 patients. If the indication for reoperation was fragmentation, hair-line pseudarthrosis, or central spinal stenosis, the results were usually good during a follow-up period that ranged from 6 months to 4 years. At reoperation, 21 of 27 main lesions detected by CT were confirmed; six CT findings were partially or totally incorrect. However, we consider CT to be the best method for examining these problematic patients, but emphasize the choice of relevant CT diagnoses.\r"

Measurements of the mobility were conducted by inclinometers and a compass in three planes; sagittal, frontal, and horizontal. The structurally healthy girls were taller and heavier than the scoliotics; the difference was statistically significant for weight (P less than 0.01). The positional inclines of sacrum, upper lumbar and thoracic areas were significantly smaller in the scoliotics, resulting in smaller lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis in them (P less than 0.001). In the thoracic spine, forward flexion was smaller (P less than 0.01), whereas extension (P less than 0.001) and the total sagittal mobility (P less than 0.01) were greater in the scoliotics. In the healthy controls, the thoracic clockwise rotation was significantly (P less than 0.05) larger than the counterclockwise. This side difference had disappeared in the scoliotics, and their total thoracic rotation was indicatively smaller than in the controls. In the lumbar spine, extension was smaller (P less than 0.01) in the scoliotics than in the controls. All spinal mobility measurements noted there was no change of general spinal flexibility in the scoliotics.\r"

The following conclusions were drawn from investigations which comprise 37 cell culture assays: (a) tissue cultures of meningiomas inherit the disadvantages of loss of the progesterone receptor and frequent transformation to cells resembling fibroblasts after three to four passages. For these reasons, drug testing as well as the establishment of cell cultures that exhibit the characteristics of meningioma are impeded; (b) the progesterone receptor-content of the solid tumors does not reflect the response to medroxyprogesterone acetate-therapy in vitro; (c) medroxyprogesterone acetate-pretreated meningiomas showed sufficient in vitro growth in 38%, and untreated meningiomas grew well in 56% of the cases; (d) medroxyprogesterone acetate-induced inhibition or delay of growth was observed in 35%. These findings have resulted in criticism with respect to the value of meningioma tissue cultures for trials of hormonal manipulation and it is thought that another method, which consists of immunostaining of cycling cells, and has been tested in another study, may be superior to cell culture assays with respect to evaluation of the effect of hormonotherapy in meningiomas. Medroxyprogesterone acetate holds an interesting position because it reduces cell growth in some meningiomas in vitro.\r"

Fifteen minutes after restoration of cerebral blood flow, animals received an intravenous bolus of either succinate or fructose-1,6-diphosphate followed by continuous infusion. Another group of animals received fructose-1, 6-diphosphate beginning prior to aortic occlusion. Control animals received intravenous glucose by bolus, followed by infusion. Cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were measured before occlusion and at 2 1/2 hours after occlusion, when the animals were sacrificed. In all animals electrocortical silence was demonstrated for the 5 minutes of global ischemia. The percent change in cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels in all groups was statistically similar. Only two of seven of the control animals recovered electroencephalogram amplitude during the 2 1/2 hour observation period. Time for recovery of amplitude on the electroencephalogram in animals receiving fructose-1, 6-diphosphate either before or after ischemia was statistically similar to controls. In the succinate treated group, all seven animals regained preocclusion levels of electroencephalogram amplitude within 36 minutes of the restoration of cerebral blood flow. Succinate administered after complete global cerebral ischemia resulted in significantly increased recovery of cerebral electrical activity (Fischer's exact test, p less than 0.05).\r"

In six dogs flow was preserved and some degree of hypercapnic response remained following proximal occlusion with a patent bypass. During complete ischemia (bypass occluded) there was no hypercapnic reactivity in the ischemic zone. Significant flow was restored to the ischemic area following bypass reopening, but a cerebral blood flow decrease was seen with subsequent hypercapnia. In the opposite (control) hemisphere hypercapnia always produced significant cerebral blood flow increases. These data support the superiority of prophylactic over delayed superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass in appropriate clinical situations.\r"

The subarachnoid hemorrhage was produced by percutaneous injection of 4.5 mL of nonheparinized autologous blood into the cisterna magna of rabbits. U74006F (1 mg/kg) or placebo was injected intraperitoneally every 12 hours starting 12 hours prior to induction of hemorrhage for a total of six doses. The animals were sacrificed by perfusion fixation. The basilar artery was removed on day 2 and processed for morphometric analysis. Control/placebo and subarachnoid hemorrhage/placebo basilar artery diameters were 651.2 +/- 25.4 and 366.3 +/- 34.2 mu, respectively. Control/U74006F basilar artery diameters (669.8 +/- 21.8 mu) were not significantly different from that of the control/placebo group. U74006F treatment greatly minimized subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced reduction in mean luminal diameter (563.7 +/- 48.2 mu) (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrate considerable therapeutic promise for U74006F in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

Immediately after the anastomoses were completed, the average blood flow through the graft was 32 +/- 25 mL/min in group I and 122 +/- 22 mL/min in group II. At sacrifice 30 days later, angiography showed that all grafts in group I were thrombosed, whereas six (87.5%) of seven grafts in group II were patent.

Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at the lateral border of the olfactory tract with or without simultaneous ligation of the ipsilateral common carotid artery rarely caused cerebral infarction in Sprague-Dawley rats. Occlusion of the olfactory branch in addition to the trunk of the middle cerebral artery caused large infarction of the pallium in five of eight Sprague-Dawley rats. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at the medial border of the olfactory tract caused infarction in the pallium and/or basal ganglia in five of six rats, and neurologic deficits were severe and persistent. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at the lateral border of the olfactory tract in spontaneously hypertensive rats caused large infarction with severe neurologic deficits in all eight animals. Possible factors responsible for such diverse differences and the relative value of each group as an experimental model of focal cerebral ischemia in rats were discussed.\r"

We studied the clinical and pathological findings in 29 patients who underwent surgical procedures to revise malfunctioning ventriculoperitoneal shunts. The preoperative diagnosis for shunt malfunction was infection in 8 cases, and obstruction in 18 cases. A pathologist NK independently examined the shunt hardware removed from the patients without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis. There were 19 ventricular catheters, 15 valves, and 14 abdominal catheters examined. Fourteen of the patients had had three or more shunt revisions. Three of these patients had evidence of some hypersensitivity reaction due to the shunt hardware (multiple eosinophils and giant cells in tissue enveloping shunt hardware). Of the 15 patients who had two or less shunt revisions, none had evidence of hypersensitivity on pathological examination of the shunt hardware. We conclude that pathological examination of shunt hardware is helpful in understanding noninfectious causes of shunt malfunction. We have identified a subgroup of patients who developed a hypersensitivity-like reaction around the shunt that in certain instances may lead to shunt malfunction. It is important to identify these patients for they may be more likely to have multiple episodes of shunt malfunction.\r"

Preoperatively, there were no significant differences in gastric secretory functions between the two groups of 11 patients. Postoperatively, median fasting bile acids in the stomach increased in the Billroth II patients from 0.35 to 16.10 mumol/hr (p less than 0.01), but significantly decreased in the Roux-en-Y patients from 0.30 to 0.10 mumol/hr (p less than 0.05), which indicated adequate prevention of enterogastric reflux after the Roux-en-Y procedure. Gastrectomy resulted in significant reductions of median values of basal acid output (4.6 vs 0.6 mmol/hr, p less than 0.01, and 4.2 vs 0.4 mmol/hr, p = 0.02), peak acid output (31.6 vs 4.2 mmol/hr, p less than 0.01, and 38.7 vs 4.5 mmol/hr, p less than 0.01), serum pepsinogen A (121 vs 86 micrograms/L, p less than 0.01, and 92 vs 45 micrograms/L, p less than 0.01), meal-stimulated serum gastrin secretion (1472 vs 199 pM.60 min, p less than 0.0001, and 1017 vs 199 pM.60 min, p less than 0.0001) in the patients with Billroth II and Roux-en-Y anastomosis, respectively. There were, however, no significant differences in gastric secretory parameters between the two groups when studied 6 months after surgery. Therefore it is concluded that after gastrectomy, enterogastric reflux does not affect the secretory function of the gastric remnant within the first 6 months after surgery.\r"

Outcome definitions included the following: I, loss of 25% or more of preoperative weight; II, loss of 50% or more of excess weight; III, loss to within 50% of ideal body weight. To evaluate the impact of preoperative weight on success rate, patients were divided into two weight groups: \"morbidily\" obese patients, who were 100 to 199 pounds overweight (n = 146), and \"super\"-obese patients who were 200 pounds or more overweight (n = 36). Weight loss was significantly greater with RYGB versus HGP by each of the three definitions of success. Medical problems either improved or resolved with weight loss in 95% of cases. There were statistically significant differences in success rate depending on outcome definition in both HGP and RYGB patients. Success rate ranged from zero in super-obese HGP patients by Definition III to 97% in super-obese RYGB patients by Definition I. Although super-obese patients lost more pounds than the lighter morbidly obese patients, a significantly lower number of super-obese patients lost within 50% of ideal weight. Super-obese patients must lose more weight to reduce their actuarial risk. These results show that the definition of successful outcome may significantly influence the overall success rate in a large series of bariatric surgical patients.\r"

The value of preoperative spirometric tests to determine the risk of PRC has been recently challenged. The current prospective study was undertaken to identify the risk factors of PRC in these patients. One hundred fifty-one patients, including 67 patients who underwent abdominal aortic surgery, were included in this study. Preoperative and peroperative parameters were collected and analyzed in a multivariate analysis. PRCs were classified as minor and major. A significantly prolonged postoperative hospital stay was associated with major complications (21.3 +/- 9.0 vs 14.3 +/- 6.0 days). The overall incidence of PRC was 37.1%, and the incidence of major PRC was 15.2%. Patients who underwent abdominal aortic surgery had a higher incidence of PRC (53%; major PRC, 24%). In addition to abdominal aortic surgery, other risk factors were chest deformation, recent bronchitis, duration of surgery, and FEV1/VC. In patients who underwent abdominal aortic surgery, the risk factors for major PRC were decreases in preoperative FEV1/VC and PaO2. This study confirms the importance of an evaluation of a patient's respiratory condition, especially by preoperative spirometry and blood gas analysis, to determine the risk of PRC in a given population. General risk factors, such as the American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification, fail to achieve this task. The identification of patients with unacceptable risks remains a challenge.\r"

In animal studies hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapeutic agents with degradable starch microspheres (DSMs) produces a redistribution of blood flow between tumor and liver and an increase in tumor drug levels. In this prospective clinical study in patients with colorectal metastases, we evaluated the effect of DSMs on liver and tumor levels of fluoropyrimidines after intraoperative administration through the hepatic artery. Fourteen patients underwent infusion of radiolabeled fluorodeoxyuridine, 14C-FUdR (0.15 mg/kg, 0.5 microCi/kg), followed 2 to 5 minutes later by infusion of 3H-FUdR (0.15 mg/kg, 1.0 microCi/kg) without (n = 3) or with (n = 11) DMS. Seven of the later patients underwent major hepatic resection and tissue mapping of drug distribution, and four patients underwent biopsy procedures to remove specimens of liver and tumor 5 minutes after microsphere infusion. Administration of DSMs with FUdR increased tumor drug levels as measured by 3H-FUdR (5.9 +/- 4.4 vs 17.1 +/- 9.4 nmol/gm, p = 0.07) without altering hepatic drug levels (35.7 +/- 10.9 vs 30.2 +/- 20.9 nmol/gm, p = NS) and significantly increased the tumor/liver drug ratio of tritiated fluoropyrimidines (0.16 +/- 0.09 to 0.63 +/- 0.13, p = 0.03). Fluoropyrimidine levels in tumor and liver correlated with blood flow as measured by technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin retention. Thus, hepatic arterial administration of DSMs in human beings enhances tumor FUdR levels and may be useful in increasing tumor cytotoxicity and decreasing systemic toxicity during regional hepatic infusion.\r"

Exposing veins to arterial pressure and flow subjects them to three static deformations, three static stresses, increased pulsatile deformations, pulsatile stresses, and altered shear stress at the blood-intima interface. All of these occur simultaneously; thus it is unclear which of these nine mechanical factors predispose to the histologic changes that occur in the vein wall. Three sequential experiments were performed in 38 dogs to determine the role of each of these factors. Results showed that intimal hyperplasia is best associated with low flow velocity, a factor correlated with low blood-artery shear stress. By contrast, medial thickening is best associated with increased deformation of the vein wall in the circumferential direction (increased diameter). These findings correlate with clinical responses of vein grafts.\r"

The radial pulse on the left was intact, and there was movement of the fingers of the left hand, which ceased completely by the following morning. A computerized axial tomographic scan showed extensive swelling of the pectoral, deltoid, and other muscles around the shoulder. An emergency decompression procedure was carried out by dividing the pectoral and anterior scalene muscles; prompt return of some motor activity in the left hand followed, and this gradually returned to normal. This case of what may be termed \"axillary\" compression syndrome suggests that extra care should be taken to use an adequate axillary roll and to avoid lengthy operations in a lateral position, and indicates a method for decompression.\r"

All endarterectomies were performed with continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. Of the 42 ischemic strokes (6.4% of all endarterectomies), 34 could be studied. Seven infarcts were hemodynamically induced (five watershed infarcts, two patients with bilateral ischemia); all seven occurred during surgery. Twenty-three of the remaining 27 infarcts were within the territory of the middle cerebral artery (20) or anterior cerebral artery (three) and were probably of thromboembolic origin; 13 of these 23 occurred during surgery (57%). If intraoperative stroke was heralded by permanent electroencephalographic changes, these were not related to the moment of cross-clamping. In four patients the computed tomogram was normal. We believe these facts favor the hypothesis that thromboembolism is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of perioperative stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy under conditions of optimal cerebral monitoring.\r"

Thirty-one of 96 patients (32%) had findings of cerebral infarction on preoperative computed tomograms. Silent cerebral infarction was found preoperatively in 17 patients (18%) (lacunar infarction in 10, cortical infarction in five, both cortical and lacunar infarctions in one, and cerebellar infarction in one). Transient ischemic attacks occurred in 10 of the 17 patients with silent cerebral infarction; however, symptoms were appropriate to the site in only five of these 10 patients. Fourteen of the 17 patients with silent cerebral infarction had a hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis, and seven patients had an ulcerated plaque on preoperative angiogram. The incidence of these lesions was similar to that found in the group of 66 patients without cerebral infarction. Endarterectomy specimens revealed a higher but not significantly different incidence of ulcerated plaque in the silent cerebral infarction group. There were no perioperative deaths. Following surgery, one patient (1%) with a preoperative silent cerebral infarction suffered a transient ischemic attack, and two patients (2%) with normal preoperative computed tomograms developed permanent neurologic deficits with new cortical infarctions on postoperative computed tomograms. No new silent cerebral infarctions were found on postoperative computed tomograms in any of the 97 patients. Our data suggest that silent cerebral infarction is a common preoperative finding with an as-yet unclear etiology and that carotid endarterectomy does not appear to be a cause.\r"

Between November 1, 1981, and October 31, 1986, 184 patients presented for the first time to a general practitioner or hospital with a TIA. The crude annual incidence rate was 0.35/1000, 0.42/1000 standardized to the 1981 population of England and Wales. We estimate that each year approximately 21,000 patients in England and Wales (about half of whom are greater than 70 years old) consult a doctor for the first time with a TIA. Approximately 80% of our 184 patients had TIAs in the carotid distribution; the remainder had TIAs in the vertebrobasilar distribution or TIAs of uncertain vascular distribution. The incidence of TIA increased sharply with increasing age, and the overall incidence in men was very similar to that in women (incidence ratio 1.3). However, in middle age, men were much more likely to suffer a TIA than women (odds ratio 2.6), which probably explains the marked male predominance in most hospital-based studies and treatment trials in which the elderly, and thus women, are underrepresented. This has important implications for the design and interpretation of clinical trials of treatment for TIAs.\r"

The mean +/- SD age of the patients in the TIA group was 66.9 +/- 7.9 years compared with 68.8 +/- 6.7 in the minor stroke group. Mortality among the TIA patients was significantly higher than that among minor stroke patients (18 of 78 compared with two of 45, p less than 0.01); mortality in the minor stroke group was not higher than that in the background population, whereas mortality in the TIA group was almost twice as high. The most common cause of death in the TIA group was myocardial infarction, and morbidity due to myocardial infarction and new TIA was higher in the TIA group than in the minor stroke group (35 events compared with seven), whereas no difference was found regarding stroke (five strokes compared with eight). Preexisting vascular disease implied an increased risk of mortality and morbidity in the TIA group. We conclude that carotid-territory TIA indicates a worse prognosis than minor stroke as mortality is higher in TIA patients at the same preexisting vascular disease prevalence and stroke frequency.\r"

One-year survival increased from 49% in the first program to 62% in the second for all stroke patients, from 54% to 68% for patients with cerebral infarction, and from 18% to 55% for patients with cerebral hemorrhage. While other reports have attributed declining stroke mortality to a decline in the incidence of stroke, our study suggests that increased survival after stroke may account for a large portion of the decrease in stroke mortality.\r"

The relation between the length of stay (i.e., the time to death or discharge to long-term care, rehabilitation, or home) and the explanatory variables (age, sex, neighborhood socioeconomic status, type of stroke, and university affiliation of the discharging hospital) was assessed using Cox's proportional hazards models. Older patients and those with hemorrhagic strokes had the highest risk of death. However, patients with hemorrhagic strokes were more likely to survive if admitted to a university teaching hospital. Older patients, those with nonhemorrhagic strokes, and those admitted to university teaching hospitals were more likely to be discharged to long-term care. A greater proportion of patients discharged to rehabilitation centers were young, lived in a high-socioeconomic-status neighborhood, and had suffered a nonhemorrhagic stroke. Patients had a significantly higher probability of going home if they were young, had had a nonhemorrhagic stroke, had been admitted to a university teaching hospital, or were male.\r"

The effect of postembolic treatment with flunarizine and streptokinase on hemispheric cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction ratio (OER), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied by positron emission tomography (oxygen-15 technique) 24 hours after the insult. We studied five groups of experimental dogs and compared them with a control group of nonembolized dogs. Group I received no treatment, Group II was treated locally with 500,000 IU streptokinase starting 30 minutes after the insult, Group III received streptokinase locally 30 minutes after the insult and 0.1 mg/kg i.v. flunarizine immediately after the insult and 2 hours later, Group IV received flunarizine as Group III, and Group V was orally pretreated with 0.5 mg/kg/day flunarizine during 2 weeks preceding embolization. Compared with the contralateral hemisphere, in the embolized hemisphere a significant reduction of CMRO2 (-25% to -40%) and CBF in normocapnia (-35%) and hypercapnia (-50%) was observed in Groups I, II, and V. In Groups III and IV, CMRO2, OER, and CBF of the embolized hemisphere were within the normal range during normocapnia and hypercapnia; the extent of the ischemic lesions was markedly less than in the other groups of experimental dogs. We conclude that flunarizine treatment after experimental thromboembolic stroke had a favorable influence on brain tissue. Chronic preventive flunarizine treatment failed to have a beneficial effect.\r"

The rats received no injury, a mild (2.3-g), or a severe (53.0-g) spinal cord injury lasting 1 minute. We used the hydrogen clearance technique to measure spinal cord blood flow at the injury site (T1) and at an adjacent site (C6). Mean systemic arterial blood pressure was either increased with adrenaline or decreased by phlebotomy in 20-mm-Hg intervals except for the severe-injury group, in which the posttraumatic pressure could only be increased with adrenaline. Spinal cord blood flow remained constant in the no-injury group between 81 and 180 mm Hg. After a mild injury, induced moderate hypertension (121-140 mm Hg) improved spinal cord blood flow significantly, whereas hypotension decreased it in a linear fashion. Severe injury caused a marked decrease in spinal cord blood flow and mean systemic arterial blood pressure. Even extreme hypertension (161-180 mm Hg) induced by adrenaline did not significantly increase spinal cord blood flow at T1 but caused hyperemia at C6 due to loss of autoregulation. In conclusion, normotension should be attempted, irrespective of the severity of spinal cord injury. Induced hypertension after severe spinal cord injury was not beneficial in improving spinal cord blood flow at the injury site while potentially increasing hemorrhage and edema.\r"

At perfusion pressures of less than 150 mm Hg, there was no significant change in local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. At pressures of greater than 170 mm Hg, significant changes occurred in BBB permeability in the superficial cortical layers and there was a mild reduction of LCBF. In the group of rats subjected to 200 mm Hg perfusion pressure, the change in BBB permeability extended to the entire cortical zone and significant reduction of LCBF occurred. Our results indicate for the first time that during conditions of focal cerebral ischemia, the rat cerebral venous system can tolerate up to 150 mm Hg of retrograde perfusion pressure into the cerebral venous system without any change in BBB permeability or in LCBF. However, progressive change in BBB permeability and reduction in LCBF occur once the perfusion pressure exceeds 170 mm Hg. This finding may permit more efficient delivery of cytoprotective agents into ischemic tissue.\r"

In the first group of five baboons, a hemodynamic model was produced by creating unilateral and bilateral carotid stenotic lesions of varying degrees with and without associated reduction in systemic perfusion pressure. Only global ischemic changes and no focal changes resulted. In the second group of three baboons, a macroembolic model was produced by introducing solid particulate material into the extracranial circulation. No reversible contralateral focal neurologic changes resulted. In the third group of 11 baboons, cerebral ischemia was produced by introducing agents known to cause platelet aggregation (arachidonic acid, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen) into the extracranial arterial circulation. Arachidonic acid caused seizures, adenosine diphosphate caused severe postural hypotension, and only collagen fibrils produced a picture resembling a transient ischemic attack. We propose a theory that intravascular activation of the prostaglandin cascade by chemical initiation may result in the pathophysiologic changes of transient cerebral ischemia.\r"

We describe a patient with a fetal posterior cerebral artery originating from the internal carotid artery, and the initial manifestation of his extracranial internal carotid artery occlusive disease was hemianopsia from occipital infarction.\r"

The fifth patient suffered loss of vision as a result of a concurrent giant intracranial dissecting aneurysm. Arteriography demonstrated a \"string sign\" in two cases and a cervical carotid aneurysm in three; two of the latter also had siphon occlusion, and one of these had a superimposed supraclinoid dissecting aneurysm. One patient was treated by thromboendarterectomy, one by aneurysmorraphy, another by carotid ligation, and the other two patients were treated medically. Mechanisms of injury, forensic problems, and therapeutic options are discussed.\r"

RBC monoclonal autoantibodies have been obtained from animal models of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), but to date no warm-reactive monoclonal autoantibodies have been generated from human B cells. Using the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation method, clones of RBC autoantibodies were generated from two patients with AIHA. These antibodies reacted preferentially at 37 degrees C, agglutinated or bound to a variety of different RBC phenotypes, and were IgM in nature. The serologic reactivity of one clone showed a relative specificity to e+ RBCs that was similar to that seen in the patient's serum. These results are the first to demonstrate that warm-reactive RBC autoantibodies can be obtained from patients with AIHA using the technique of EBV transformation, and they further substantiate the existence of warm-reactive IgM RBC autoantibodies in the spectrum of warm AIHA.\r"

  ".W": "Current standards recommend that red cells (RBCs) should be frozen within 6 days of donation. There are situations, however, in which it is desirable to freeze RBCs that are older than 6 days, such as for the salvage of rare or autologous units. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of RBCs frozen after prolonged liquid storage, standard units were drawn from nine normal donors and stored at 4 degrees C for 42 days in a nutrient-additive solution, AS-3. 51CrRBC survival assays were performed (24-hour survival: 78.2 +/- 12.4%; n = 8) and the units were frozen at -80 degrees C in glycerol for 8 weeks. After deglycerolization, the mean RBC recovery was 81.0 +/- 4.1 percent and the mean 24-hour 51Cr survival was 78.0 +/- 9.1 percent. The index of therapeutic effectiveness (ITE) was determined by multiplying the postdeglycerolization 24-hour 51Cr survival by the mean RBC recovery (63.3 +/- 9.2). ITE values greater than 60 percent (75% 51Cr survival x 80% RBC recovery) were considered acceptable. Mean adenosine triphosphate levels declined from an initial 3.81 +/- 0.56 micromol per g of hemoglobin to 2.33 +/- 0.55 micromol per g after frozen storage. These findings show that an acceptable percentage of RBCs survives frozen storage after maximum liquid storage (mean ITE greater than 60%). If necessary, RBCs stored in AS-3 can be frozen at any time before 42 days.\r"

The polymer enhances the avidity and affinity of clinically significant red cell alloantibodies than those obtained with bovine serum albumin (BSA). The sensitivity and specificity of the PEG-mediated reactions were superior to those obtained with BSA. Subpopulations of red cells, such as those encountered with fetomaternal hemorrhages, were detected at lower concentrations with PEG than with BSA using the microscopic Du test. The superiority of the PEG reaction, its simplicity, and the reagent's relatively low cost make substitution of the polymer for BSA in the IAGT an attractive option.\r"

  ".W": "Red cells (RBCs) prepared by a new system using centrifugation to produce neocyte enrichment were studied in two laboratories. The system used a blood bag with a geometric configuration such that younger, less dense cells could be separated from older, denser cells. Phthalate ester density gradient curves determined that neocyte enrichment was 81.3 percent in one laboratory and 82 percent in the other. RBC viability was studied by 51Cr autologous transfusion in normal volunteer donors. A randomized, paired design was used in which each donor was transfused once each with neocytes and with RBCs of all ages. The mean control half-life was 34.8 +/- 5.4 days in one laboratory and 34.0 +/- 3.6 days in the other. The mean half-life of the neocyte-enriched RBCs was 45.2 +/- 8.2 days in one laboratory and 45.1 +/- 4.4 days in the other. This represented a more than 30 percent increase in half-life for the neocyte-enriched RBCs, a significant difference. This new system, a two-bag set that costs +15, allows the simple, efficient separation of neocyte-enriched RBCs that would have a longer half-life and could reduce the transfusion requirement in patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-two chemical substances, chosen because they might influence red cell metabolism, were screened for effect on red cell adenosine triphosphate and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) levels during storage in CPD or CPDA-1 at 4 degrees C. Of these substances, six appeared on initial screening to increase 2,3 DPG levels during storage; on repeated examination, four compounds, i.e., oxalate, glyoxalate, ethyl oxaloacetate, and L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine, consistently increased 2,3 DPG levels during storage. It was shown that glyoxalate was converted rapidly to oxalate in blood, presumably through the lactate dehydrogenase reaction. Ethyl oxaloacetate is known to hydrolyze, giving rise to oxalate. Thus, the effect of both glyoxalate and ethyl oxaloacetate can be explained by the formation of oxalate, a compound already known to increase 2,3 DPG levels. The effect of L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine remains to be explained, but it may be hydrolyzed to L-alanine and L-phenylalanine, both of which are thought to have the capacity to increase red cell 2,3 DPG levels by inhibiting pyruvate kinase activity.\r"
