The simulations revealed that there were marked differences between the rate of arterial desaturation which resulted from each of the three types of oxygen supply failure and that arterial oxygen saturation may reach dangerous levels before a pulse oximeter alarm is activated.\r"

Many of the recognised clinical signs of cardiac tamponade were absent, in particular, there was no compensatory tachycardia, and heart rate remained stable despite severe hypotension before surgical drainage of the pericardium. The possible aetiology and pathophysiology is discussed. It is suggested that after major trauma, cardiac tamponade should be considered as a possibility even in the absence of significantly abnormal cardiovascular signs, evidence of direct chest injury, or an abnormal chest X ray.\r"

The authors compared gastric fluid volume and pH in two groups of children, one of whom was permitted clear liquids until 2 h before surgery (study group) and the other followed routine preoperative fasting orders (control group). The study group was not limited in the quantity of clear liquid allowed with the exception that the last intake prior to surgery was limited to 8 ounces. The study group (n = 53) averaged 5.9 +/- 5 yr and weighed 23.6 +/- 17 kg, while the control group averaged 7.3 +/- 4.6 yr and weighed 29 +/- 17.7 kg (P = NS). Gastric contents were aspirated following induction of anesthesia. Gastric fluid volume averaged 0.44 +/- 0.51 ml/kg for study group and 0.57 +/- 0.51 ml/kg in the control group (P = 0.12). Of the study patients, 48% had a measured gastric fluid volume greater than or equal to 0.4 ml/kg compared with 58% of the control patients (P = 0.77). Eighty three patients had sufficient gastric fluid for pH determination; of these 34/35 (97%) in the study group and 44/48 (92%) in the control group had a gastric fluid pH less than or equal to 2.5. Using a linear analog scale parents rated the children in the study group to be less irritable (P less than 0.001) and to have had a better overall preoperative experience (P less than 0.01) compared with the control patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Oliguria also frequently develops in patients with normal concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Most of these patients do not develop renal failure. The authors prospectively studied 100 patients admitted to the ICU to determine the etiology of oliguria in these patients. Eighteen patients (18%) developed oliguria (less than 0.33 ml.kg-1.h-1 X 2 h). Seven and eleven patients were felt on clinical assessment to be hypovolemic or normovolemic, respectively. Compared with the hypovolemic patients, the normovolemic oliguric patients had significantly lower serum osmolalities (278 +/- 3 vs. 290 +/- 5 mOsm/kg H2O) and serum sodium concentrations (138 +/- 3 vs. 132 +/- 1 mEq/l). In addition, normovolemic patients had significantly higher urine sodium concentrations (83 +/- 12 vs. 13 +/- 2 mEq/l), fractional excretion of sodium (1.14 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.03), and renal failure indices (1.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.04). ADH concentrations in six hypovolemic and six normovolemic patients were increased in both groups but not significantly different. The hypovolemic patients increased their urine output from 17 +/- 2 ml/h to greater than 0.5 ml.kg-1.h-1 following a 500-ml bolus of normal saline. The normovolemic oliguric patients remained oliguric following the saline bolus (13 +/- 2 to 19 +/- 3 ml/h). The authors conclude that oliguria is common in critically ill patients and results from renal hypoperfusion and ADH excess.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty patients were randomly allocated to receive either epidural fentanyl (100 micrograms in 10 ml normal saline) or 10 ml epidural normal saline. In a further 25 patients an epidural catheter was inserted but no solution injected. In contrast to this latter group, epidural fentanyl and normal saline both produced segmental sensory changes. There were no significant differences between fentanyl and normal saline groups in the number of patients reporting sensory changes to pin prick, rate of onset of these changes, or segmental level. For cold stimuli, more patients in the fentanyl group than in the normal saline group reported a change (16 vs. 8; P = 0.02) but the segmental level was similar. The effect of normal saline as a diluent in epidurally administered opioids may be of clinical importance.\r"

  ".W": "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become a commonly used monitor of left ventricular (LV) function and filling during cardiac surgery. Its use is based on the assumption that changes in LV short-axis ID reflect changes in LV volume. To study the ability of TEE to estimate LV volume and ejection immediately following CABG, 10 patients were studied using blood pool scintigraphy, TEE, and thermodilution cardiac output (CO). A single TEE short-axis cross-sectional image of the LV at the midpapillary muscle level was used for area analysis. Between 1 and 5 h postoperatively, simultaneous data sets (scintigraphy, TEE, and CO) were obtained three to five times in each patient. End-diastolic (EDa) and end-systolic (ESa) areas were measured by light pen. Ejection fraction area (EFa) was calculated (EFa = (EDa - ESa)/EDa). When EFa was compared with EF by scintigraphy, correlation was good (r = 0.82 SEE = 0.07). EDa was taken as an indicator of LV volume and compared with LVEDVI which was derived from EF by scintigraphy and CO. Correlation between EDa and LVEDVI was fair (r = 0.74 SEE = 3.75). The authors conclude that immediately following CABG, a single cross-sectional TEE image provides a reasonable estimate of EF but not LVEDVI.\r"

When the cervix was fully dilated, coded study solution was substituted for the known bupivacaine-fentanyl solution. The study solution for 29 patients was 0.0625% bupivacaine-0.0002% fentanyl; 34 patients received saline placebo. The two groups had similar pain scores during the first stage of labor. During the second stage, pain scores were significantly higher in the saline-placebo group at each 30-min interval between 60 and 150 min after the diagnosis of full cervical dilation. Similarly, there was a significant difference between the two groups in global assessment of analgesia quality during the second stage, but the difference occurred in those patients with a second-stage duration of greater than or equal to 60 min. Among the women who delivered vaginally, eleven of 28 (39%) women in the bupivacaine-fentanyl group, versus five of 34 (15%) in the saline-placebo group, had surgical perineal anesthesia for vaginal delivery (P less than .05). Six of 28 (21%) women in the bupivacaine-fentanyl group, and five of 34 (15%) in the saline-placebo group, underwent instrumental vaginal delivery (P = NS).

Contracture testing was performed in a standardized fashion using 3% halothane alone and incremental doses of caffeine alone. Medical records were examined for 54 anesthetic exposures in 42 MH(-) patients who had received anesthesia since their MH testing. Sixteen patients received anesthesia with known MH triggering agents on 23 occasions, all without incident. In six MH(-) patients with previous masseter muscle rigidity, no adverse reactions occurred in response to volatile anesthetic agents. Succinylcholine was avoided in these patients. Eleven MH(-) patients were managed as if MH-susceptible, although it was known that these patients had tested MH(-). Two of these patients also receive prophylactic iv dantrolene. These results suggest that \"triggering\" anesthetic agents may be safely administered to patients who test MH(-) by in vitro contracture testing. However, until the anesthetic experience of larger numbers of MH(-) patients is known, these results should be interpreted cautiously.\r"

  ".W": "Epidural injection of drug combinations may decrease toxicity by decreasing the dose of each component, but may also result in detrimental drug interactions. In this study interactions among bupivaciane, fentanyl, epinephrine, 2-chloroprocaine, and lidocaine for epidural analgesia during labor were examined. In part 1 of the study, healthy parturients received in a random manner either 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with 5 micrograms/ml fentanyl (n = 50), or 10 ml of this combination with 3.33 micrograms/ml freshly added epinephrine (n = 50). Epinephrine prolonged the median duration of pain relief (180 vs. 138 min, P less than 0.05) without affecting duration of first or second stages of labor, or neonatal Apgar scores. Blood pressure decreased slightly more in those receiving epinephrine, although the incidence of hypotension requiring treatment did not differ between groups. Part 2 of the study evaluated the possibility that local anesthetic used for confirming catheter tip location may interfere with the analgesic action of this bupivacaine-fentanyl-epinephrine (BFE) combination. In 50 additional parturients, a test dose of either 2-chloroprocaine (n = 25) or lidocaine (n = 25) was injected through the epidural catheter and was followed by injection of the BFE mixture. The lidocaine test dose group had a greater duration of analgesia than the 2-chloroprocaine test dose group (median duration of 164 vs. 91 min, P less than 0.05). The authors conclude that the addition of epinephrine 3.33 micrograms/ml significantly increases the duration of analgesia obtained from 0.25% bupivacaine with 5 micrograms/ml fentanyl. However, prior injection of 2-chloroprocaine, but not lidocaine, significantly decreases the duration of analgesia achieved with this BFE mixture.\r"

Traditionally TOF has been applied with a supramaximal stimulus but this may be quite uncomfortable for the awake patient. In the first part of this study, 12 healthy volunteers quantified (by 10-cm visual analog scale) the discomfort associated with TOF stimulation at 20, 30, and 50 mA. The median VAS scores were 2, 3, and 6, respectively (P less than 0.05 for differences between each group). In the second part, single twitch and TOF responses were compared at 20, 30, and 50 mA in 64 postoperative and in 19 intraoperative patients who had ratios of the fourth to the first twitch (T4/T1) ranging from 0.15-1.03. In all patients, neuromuscular responses to nerve stimulation were recorded by a mechanogram, and the T4/T1 ratios were calculated. Although single twitch heights increased significantly as amperage was increased, there was no statistical difference in the T4/T1 ratios at the three different currents. The mean +/- SD T4/T1 ratios at 20, 30, and 50 mA were 0.795 +/- 0.247, 0.798 +/- 0.237, and 0.802 +/- 0.233, respectively (P = ns). It is concluded that TOF monitoring using a submaximal stimulus is more comfortable for the awake patient who is suspected of residual weakness, and that T4/T1 testing can be reliably accomplished intraoperatively as well as postoperatively using submaximal stimuli.\r"

The authors' investigation was designed in a randomized, double-blind fashion to compare the clinical effectiveness of ropivacaine and bupivacaine in patients undergoing lower-extremity surgery. Forty-five patients were randomized to receive 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine or bupivacaine. Intermittent sensory (pinprick) and motor (Bromage score) measurements were made while the block was in effect, and changes in heart rate, blood pressure and amounts of additional analgesics, sedatives and other medications were also recorded. Presence of tourniquet pain and the quality of anesthesia were also assessed. One patient was excluded from analysis; thus, 22 patients each received ropivacaine or bupivacaine. No differences were found in patient or perioperative characteristics between the groups. The quality and extent of sensory and motor blockade between groups were comparable, although bupivacaine was slightly longer acting. Cardiovascular changes, incidence of tourniquet pain, and the amounts of supplemental medications necessary were also similar between groups. The authors found 0.5% ropivacaine and bupivacaine to be clinically similar in both sensory- and motor-blocking characteristics, with the exception that bupivacaine produced a blockade of slightly longer duration. Because ropivacaine is reported to be less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine in animal studies, the similarity of clinical epidural anesthesia may make ropivacaine the preferred agent.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the postoperative pain relief provided by simple instillation of bupivacaine into a hernia wound with that provided by ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric (IG/IH) nerve block. Sixty children undergoing inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia were randomized to receive 0.25 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine for either IG/IH nerve block or up to 0.5 ml/kg of the same solution for instillation nerve blocks. In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), a trained blinded observer evaluated the patient's level of postoperative pain using a standardized 10-point objective pain scale. Fentanyl 1-2 micrograms/kg was administered intravenously to any child scoring 6 or more points on the pain scale. The difference in pain scores among the two groups were compared. The two groups were not significantly different in age, duration of surgery, or anesthesia. There was no significant difference between patients who received the two treatment modalities in their pain scores, analgesic requirements in the PACU, recovery times, and discharge times. These results demonstrate that the simple instillation of local anesthetics into a wound provides postoperative pain relief following hernia repair, which is as effective as that provided by intraoperative IG/IH nerve block.\r"

  ".W": "New planar lipid bilayer technology enabled the pharmacologic study of single sodium channels from human brain, overcoming the limitations of tissue availability and the rapid loss of protein function in conventional experimental preparations. Synaptosomal vesicles prepared from human brain cortical tissue were fused with planar lipid bilayers. In the presence of batrachotoxin, sodium channels were incorporated into lipid bilayers and their single-channel properties studied. Pentobarbital was found to depress two major functions of the sodium channel, leading to a voltage-independent reduction of the fractional channel open-time (ED50 0.61-0.75 mM) and an interaction with the voltage-dependent steady-state activation. The steady-state activation curve was shifted to more negative potentials and had a reduced slope, i.e., negative membrane potentials became less effective at closing sodium channels. The results were consistent with a pentobarbital-induced increase in protein flexibility. The actions of the two optical stereoisomers of pentobarbital showed no significant differences, indicating that other ion channels must also be involved in the clinical actions of barbiturates. The pentobarbital effects on sodium channels occurred at concentrations thought to be relevant in general anesthesia and within the clinical range. This suggests that sodium channels could contribute to overall anesthetic depression, supporting our hypothesis that anesthesia results from the superposition and integration of several anesthetic actions at the molecular level.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have used computer simulation to examine the time course of the plasma concentration, estimated effect site concentration, and the intensity of the central nervous system (CNS) effect of fentanyl and alfentanil. The simulations were performed over a range of clinically equivalent doses. Simulations of the changes in the processed electroencephalogram (EEG) was used as a reflection of drug induced CNS effect. The simulations reveal that the rate of equilibration between effect site and plasma concentrations can explain differences in the clinical time course of drug effect between these opioids. The onset of fentanyl EEG drug effect is delayed relative to alfentanil and the duration of action is longer. Pharmacokinetic differences do not explain the disparity seen in the time courses of EEG drug effect. Alfentanil and fentanyl have similar plasma disposition curves during the first 90 min. The concentrations at the effect site are, however, quite different. The simulations illustrate how fentanyl's slow blood:brain equilibration can dampen the rate of rise and fall of effect site concentrations. As a mechanism for terminating effect, redistribution of opioid from effect site to other body regions is less relevant for fentanyl compared with that for alfentanil. The evanescent clinical effects of alfentanil can be explained by the rapid blood:brain equilibration. Computer simulation is a useful tool for revealing relevant determinants of the complex relationship between dose and the time course of effect.\r"

Dogs were randomly assigned to two groups, receiving either 1.2 and 2 MAC of sevoflurane (n = 11) or isoflurane (n = 11). At 1.2 and 2 MAC, sevoflurane produced an increase in heart rate (+60 +/- 12% and +54 +/- 9%, respectively), dose-dependent aortic hypotension (-22 +/- 4% and -38 +/- 4%, respectively), systemic vasodilation (-22 +/- 5% and -19 +/- 5%, respectively), dose-dependent decrease in stroke volume (-31 +/- 6% and -48 +/- 4%, respectively), and left ventricular dP/dt (-40 +/- 4% and -61 +/- 10%, respectively). Cardiac output decreased only at 2 MAC (-17 +/- 6%). Finally, coronary blood flow increased at 1.2 MAC of sevoflurane (+29 +/- 8%). Except for heart rate, sevoflurane and isoflurane produced similar effects. At 1.2 MAC, sevoflurane produced a greater increase in heart rate than isoflurane (+60 +/- 12% vs. +33 +/- 9%). The authors conclude that, except for heart rate, the effects of sevoflurane on cardiac function and coronary blood flow are almost identical to those induced by isoflurane in the chronically instrumented dog.\r"

To examine clonidine's acute maternal and fetal effects, the authors injected clonidine (100, 300, 750, 1500 micrograms cumulative dose at 15-min intervals) intrathecally in nine chronically prepared near-term ewes. Unlike intrathecal saline injection, which did not alter any parameters, clonidine altered maternal blood pressure in a biphasic manner (depression at lower doses and return to baseline after the highest dose). Clonidine produced a dose-dependent decrease in maternal and fetal heart rate. After the highest dose, 1500 micrograms, PO2 decreased in both ewe and fetus, accompanied by fetal hypertension and bradycardia. Clonidine increased maternal and fetal serum glucose, but not cortisol. Although clonidine-induced hypoxemia and hyperglycemia occur only in sheep, fetal bradycardia may limit the usefulness of clonidine in large doses (greater than 10 micrograms/kg) in obstetrics. Lower doses, such as may be used to enhance spinal anesthesia, are well tolerated in sheep.\r"

  ".W": "The neuromuscular blocking effects and pharmacokinetics of ORG 9426, 1.5 mg/kg and ORG 9616, 1.2 mg/kg iv, two new nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, were studied in 28 cats (i.e., 14 cats with each drug) with and without renal pedicle ligation. A gas chromatographic assay was used to determine the concentrations of ORG 9426 and ORG 9616 and its desacetyl metabolites in plasma, urine, bile, and liver. The duration of neuromuscular blockade of both drugs was not altered by ligation of renal pedicles. Plasma clearance of ORG 9426 was slower in cats with ligated renal pedicles (P less than 0.01). With ORG 9616, mean elimination half-life was slower and mean residence time longer in cats with renal pedicle ligation. Otherwise, there was no significant differences with any pharmacokinetic variables in cats with and without renal pedicle ligation. Only 8.7 +/- 5.7% (SD) and 6.0 +/- 2.8% of an injected dose of ORG 9426 and ORG 9616 was excreted into the urine, respectively. Conversely, 54.4 +/- 9.2% and 52.4 +/- 9.2% of an injected dose of ORG 9426 and 35.7 +/- 12.2% and 46.8 +/- 9.7% of ORG 9616 were excreted into the bile in cats without and with renal pedicle ligation, respectively. Finally, 21.3 +/- 6.5% and 33.5 +/- 15.6% of ORG 9426 and 14.0 +/- 3.2% and 18.1 +/- 5.6% of ORG 9616 were in the liver 6 h after injection in cats without and with renal pedicle ligation respectively.

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation with interposed abdominal compression for restoration of spontaneous circulation in an asphyxial and fibrillatory arrest model. Twenty-eight pigs weighing 19-27 kg were randomly allocated to two arrest groups. Each of these two groups was then subdivided into a treatment group and a control group resulting in four groups of seven pigs each. In the control groups standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with a pneumatically driven chest compressor at a rate of 80 beats per min. The animals' lungs were ventilated at a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per min independently of chest compression. In the treatment group, in addition to standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual interposed abdominal compression was applied at the midabdomen in the second half of the relaxation phase using a blood pressure cuff to measure and standardize the compressions. Following asphyxial cardiac arrest of 3 min, none of the seven animals could be resuscitated with standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whereas all seven animals could be resuscitated with interposed abdominal compression and standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation after 240 +/- 84 s. Following fibrillatory cardiac arrest of 4 min, none of the seven animals that received standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation and countershocks could be resuscitated. In the group that received standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation and interposed abdominal compression spontaneous circulation was achieved in all animals in 244 +/- 117 s. End-diastolic arteriovenous pressure difference, which correlates with coronary blood flow, was significantly higher with interposed abdominal compression during resuscitation from both forms of cardiac arrest. The results of our study indicate that cardiopulmonary resuscitation with interposed abdominal compression in the second half of the relaxation phase improves diastolic arteriovenous pressure difference and resuscitation success in comparison with that following standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The use of interposed abdominal compression during basic cardiac life support should be investigated further in patients.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of the product of systolic blood pressure and heart rate as a correlate of myocardial oxygen consumption has been questioned in anesthetized patients, suggesting that anesthesia alters the relationship between myocardial oxygen consumption and the hemodynamics. This relationship was reexamined in the awake state and during 0.95% end-tidal halothane anesthesia in seven chronically instrumented dogs. Measurements of myocardial oxygen consumption were compared with two indices, the systolic pressure rate product and the pressure work index. The latter is a weighted combination of the systolic pressure rate product and external cardiac work. A wide range in myocardial oxygen consumption (3.0-38.2 ml O2.min-1.100g-1) and hemodynamic states (range in pressure rate 4,100-40,700 mmHg/min and range in pressure work 3.7-37.0 ml O2.min-1.100g-1) was achieved with infusions of norepinephrine, nitroglycerin, neosynephrine, nitroprusside, and isoproterenol. Both the pressure rate product and the pressure work index correlated closely with myocardial oxygen consumption not only when the animals were awake but also during anesthesia. For each animal best-fit regression analysis for the awake and the anesthetized data did not reveal any significant change in the slope or y-intercept. Pooled data analysis that only permitted a change in slope with the addition of anesthesia (intercept unchanged) revealed a 17% decrease (P less than 0.05 on t test) in the slope constant when the pressure rate product was applied and no change in slope when the pressure work index was used to estimate myocardial oxygen consumption. It was concluded that myocardial oxygen consumption can be estimated during 0.95% halothane anesthesia by either index but that the pressure work index performs better than the systolic pressure rate product.\r"

  ".W": "The negative inotropic effect of halothane and isoflurane on potentiated-state contractions of isolated rabbit atria in a normal Ca2+ (2.5 mM) medium was compared with the force depression in low Ca2+ media without an anesthetic. When this comparison was made in the presence of 1 microM ryanodine so that the force of contraction was dependent only upon transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx with no Ca2+ contribution from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the force of contraction was depressed equally by 0.6% halothane in a normal Ca2+ medium and by a 1.5 mM Ca2+ medium without the anesthetic. Similarly, 1.0% halothane or 1.5% isoflurane and a 1.0 mM Ca2+ medium were equally depressant as were 2.4% isoflurane and a 0.5 mM Ca2+ medium. In the absence of ryanodine, where the atrial contractile activity is largely dependent on Ca2+ released from the SR, 0.6% halothane in the normal Ca2+ medium depressed contractile force by 32%, whereas the force was depressed by only 16% in the 1.5 mM Ca2+ medium without the anesthetic. Similar results were obtained when the effects of 1.0% halothane and of 1.0 mM Ca2+ were compared. In contrast, the force of contraction measured in the absence of ryanodine was not at all inhibited by 1.5% isoflurane and minimally (11%) inhibited by 2.4% isoflurane. Consequently, the force depression by isoflurane was less than that found in the low Ca2+ media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both morphine and halothane produce a dose-related inhibition of electrically induced muscle contraction. The IC50 of morphine was unchanged by the toxin (2.1 and 2.2 X 10(-7) M in control and toxin-pretreated animals). However, the IC50 of halothane was increased from 2.1 to an extrapolated value of 9.1 vol/vol% by pertussis toxin. At high levels of inhibition the interaction between morphine and halothane was synergistic and was converted to additive in the presence of the toxin. These results demonstrate that in the myenteric longitudinal muscle preparation the effects of halothane, but not those of morphine, are mediated by the substrate for pertussis toxin, possibly a Gi membrane protein. The present study provides significant evidence that the effects of halothane on neuronal tissue are dependent upon an interaction with a specific membrane protein.\r"

Respondents reported mean work weeks of 47.5 h (CRNA) to 69.8 h (residents), longest continuous period of administering anesthesia without a break of 6.6 h (CRNA) to 7.7 h (residents), and longest period of administering anesthesia with or without breaks of 14.1 h (CRNA) to 20 h (resident). However, the respondents considered it safe to administer anesthesia without a break for 4.2 (CRNA) to 5.2 h (anesthesiologists) and with break for 12.8 h (CRNA) to 15 h (residents). A substantial number of respondents believed that they work at least occasionally beyond their perceived self-limitations. The majority of respondents recalled having made errors in the administration of anesthesia that they attributed to fatigue. These results may not be representative of work patterns or attitudes among American anesthesia providers because of the small sample size and the resultant potential for bias. Yet, the subject deserves attention and further study because fatigue can affect professional performance, ability to learn, and family life.\r"

  ".W": "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder for which an immunologic etiology has been proposed. Food hypersensitivity may contribute to part of the pathogenesis of this disorder. In preliminary studies, we evaluated 11 Crohn's patients by history, skin testing (ST), total and specific(s) IgE and sIgE/sIgG4 levels to five food proteins [egg (E), milk (M), wheat (W), soy (S), and corn (C)] using a sensitive enzyme monoclonal antibody assay. Skin testing was also performed using grass and mold allergens. Lymphocyte concanavalin (Con A) mitogenic and antigenic responses to food proteins were also determined by tritiated thymidine incorporation. Mean sIgG4 values for four food proteins are listed below: (Table: see text). No patient reacted with elevated sIgE or sIgG4 to corn. All patients had low to negative sIgE levels to all foods and only three had increased total IgE. Three of eight were history and ST positive to M, E, and W. Six of eight had at least one positive ST to M, E, W, and S. All patients had negative sIgG4 to tested inhalants and two had elevated sIgE to grass pollen. Although mean lymphocyte Con A mitogenesis was significantly decreased in eight patients compared with controls (P less than .05), an increased food stimulatory response to milk protein was observed (P less than .05). Perhaps, decreased sIgE and cell-mediated mitogenic responsiveness may lead to an enhanced humoral IgG response. The increased sIgG4 humoral response to egg protein and cellular sensitivity to milk protein may indicate mucosal antigenic stimulation or leakage in patients with Crohn's disease in spite of negative sIgE levels.\r"

The objective was to determine safety and efficacy and factors contributing to these from this information. Approximately ninety-six percent of completed questionnaires and 97.5% of patients reported symptomatic improvement. The requirement for supplemental medication was reported in 21.6% of questionnaires and by 35.6% of patients. This requirement was greater in females, in patients with asthma, and in patients with greater numbers of antigens administered. Single antigen programs provided the best response. Systemic reactions were reported in 6.7% of patients treated. In 1% of patients these reactions were severe and required adrenalin for management. Severe reactions occurred when higher concentrations of antigens were injected and frequently developed without warning of prior milder episodes. It was concluded that immunotherapy programs are safe and effective given in appropriate circumstances and with proper safeguards. A monitoring system, however, would provide valuable information on patient progress and collectively may indicate trends in response.\r"

The correlation coefficient between EPF and PF following PF drops of 15% was .993 overall and was not significantly different following PF drops even greater than 25%. The absolute and proportional differences between PF and EPF were also not significantly affected by the magnitude of PF drop but decreased over time indicating improved accuracy of estimates with practice. Asthmatics can be trained to estimate accurately acute drops in airflow. Such ability has not been demonstrated in prior studies which utilized verbal symptom reports as indicators of subjective perception of airflow. Accurate perception would be a useful aid in achieving early recognition of acute exacerbations and in improving medication compliance. It is an adjunct to regular peak flow measurement, not a substitute for it.\r"

When the fall in PEFR or FEV1 was more than 20% compared with baseline, the fall in tcPO2 was more than 10%. We also measured the dose of radiolabeled aerosol (99mTc-DTPA) inhaled into the lung using a scintillation camera. When aerosol is inhaled during tidal breathing, there are adequate correlations between the dose of aerosol in the lung and both the age and height of the patients (P less than .001). When aerosol was inhaled during crying, little deposit within the lung was shown. When the inhalation challenge test was done during a sleeping period for children aged under 2 years, the loading dose of aerosol in the lung was sufficient. The geometrical means of respiratory threshold of histamine (RT-Hist) among 106 asthmatic and 11 control children, aged 2 to 6 years, were 1182 and 4414 micrograms/mL, respectively. The means of RT-Hist in 17 children with bronchial asthma, nine with atopic dermatitis, five with respiratory disease, and nine controls, aged under 2 years, were 1152, 964, 544, and 3402 micrograms/mL, respectively.\r"

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was identified after five of 15 BAL procedures. Other pathogens or multiple pathogens were found in some cases. A specific infectious diagnosis was obtained in ten of 15 procedures. No patient required subsequent open lung biopsy. Follow-up for a minimum of 6 weeks and response to therapy did not suggest PCP in any case where BAL failed to establish its diagnosis. No major complication was attributed to BAL. We conclude that BAL is safe and effective in the diagnosis of PCP in children with HIV infection. Guidelines are suggested to optimize its safety and utility.\r"

A comparison was made for fixed volume and uncontrolled hemorrhage between three fluid regimes: Ringer's lactate (RL), Macrodex (MD), or a small volume of a hyperosmotic solution (HSD, 7.5% NaCl/6% dextran 70) followed by RL. A mathematical model was developed to simulate blood volume restoration for these given hemorrhage and resuscitation situations. Model predictions for a fixed hemorrhage (35%) and reinfusion of each fluid regime (1 mL.min-1.kg-1) were found to agree with hematocrit and osmolality changes from experiments on anesthetized rabbits. HSD gave the quickest volume expansion after the controlled hemorrhage, which is a useful experimental model; however, it is not realistic of many trauma injuries. The model suggests for severe uncontrolled hemorrhage that HSD/RL initially hastens the bleed, yet the blood volume expansion is still more effective than RL alone for the first 20 minutes, making it an effective prehospital expander for most urban trauma situations.\r"

A retrospective review of emergency airway management in an emergency department during a 30-month period found 35 patients who underwent fiberoptic-aided endotracheal intubation; 31 were treated for medical conditions, and four were trauma patients. Indications in the medical group included failed nasotracheal intubation (ten), anatomic abnormalities (six), and the initial airway maneuver attempted (15). Indications in the trauma group with suspected cervical-spine injury included failed nasotracheal intubation (one) and initial airway maneuver attempted (three). In the medical subgroup, 25 of 31 patients were intubated successfully fiberoptically. All four trauma patients were intubated successfully, and all attempts were done nasally. The limitations of the technique were varied. Twenty of the 25 successful intubations had times recorded for completion (mean time, 1.8 +/- 1.4 minutes [SD]). Four of the six failed attempts had recorded times of 7.8 +/- 1.4 minutes. The mean time of the four trauma cases was 3 +/- 2.2 minutes. The presence of secretions, blood, or vomitus was the cause in five of the six failed intubations. The sixth patient kept swallowing the distal end of the scope. Fiscal restraints may also limit its use. At our institution, the financial commitment has been approximately +17,000 during the past nine years. Repair or replacement of broken equipment appears to be necessary every two or three years. Immediate airway control is often difficult with fiberoptic-aided endotracheal intubation and should be used only in selected patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Consequently, to investigate how autopsy results can be included on our emergency department plan, the clinical and autopsy diagnoses of 244 patients were reviewed retrospectively and compared to identify conditions that were unapparent or misdiagnosed at the time of death. The study period was from January 1984 through June 1988. The average yearly ED census was 33,266. Differences between clinical and autopsy diagnoses were categorized as class 1, 2, 3, or 4 findings. Major unexpected findings (classes 1 and 2) were found in ten patients (4%); the most common missed diagnoses were aortic dissection 3 (1.2%) and pulmonary embolus 2 (0.8%). Minor unexpected findings (classes 3 and 4) were discovered in 14 patients (5.8%). The results clearly identify unexpected findings and point to the need for more aggressive evaluations of certain conditions. Systematic review of autopsy data as presented has led to meaningful changes and delivery of care to emergency patients. Autopsies are a vital source of outcome-based information that should be part of every ED's quality assurance and risk management plan.\r"

A medical record score was defined by the presence of seven essential and seven desirable items obtained from the history and the physical examination. Only anticonvulsant levels and a serum glucose, when not ordered as part of a chemistry profile, were considered appropriate for all patients when drawn. A computed tomography head scan was deemed appropriate for patients whose neurologic status deteriorated or failed to return to baseline within one hour or who had a recent history of significant head trauma. The appropriateness of all other tests was evaluated by review of the medical record. One hundred consecutive ED visits by adult epileptics for an uncomplicated convulsion were considered. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 88 years (median, 28 years). Medical record scores ranged from 7 to 82 (median, 43). ED time ranged from eight to 539 minutes (median, 174.5 minutes).

To determine the utility of such testing, a prospective study of patients with a new-onset seizure presenting to the ED of an inner-city, university-affiliated teaching hospital was done. One hundred thirty-six patients were entered into the study between October 1984 and January 1988. All patients had uniform data collection performed. Pertinent historical information and physical examination findings were recorded on a standardized form before laboratory abnormality was a sole or contributory cause of the seizure disorder. These included four patients with hypoglycemia, four with hyperglycemia, two with hypocalcemia, and one with hypomagnesemia. Only two cases (hypoglycemia) were not suspected on the basis of findings on the history or physical examination. In ED patients, the incidence of a new-onset seizure due to a correctable metabolic disturbance is low. We conclude that, with the exception of the serum glucose, the extensive ED laboratory workup often done for the evaluation of a new-onset seizure is unnecessary. Further test ordering should be directed by the medical history and physical examination.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial catheters are used frequently to monitor critically ill children in ICUs, but their role in the emergency department has not been described. The medical records of all patients admitted to the ICU from the ED of a children's hospital during a 30-month period were reviewed retrospectively. Forty-one patients were identified as having arterial catheters placed in the ED. Catheterization was performed for serial blood gas determinations (59%) or continuous blood pressure monitoring (41%). The radial artery was catheterized in 73% of the 41 patients, and a 22-gauge catheter was used in 78% of the patients. The original catheter was discontinued before the end of medical indication in only 24% of cases--17% were discontinued for failure to draw and 7% for vascular changes at the site of the catheter. We conclude that arterial access can be used for children in the ED to monitor blood pressure and that blood gas tensions and complications are few and generally minor.\r"

This condition can be treated if the patient survives long enough to reach a trauma center, if the diagnosis is entertained early, and if the appropriate diagnostic studies are obtained in an expeditious manner. We believe that echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice for pericardial tamponade, whether it is the result of penetrating or blunt trauma, and that early use of this modality may improve survivability.\r"

The specimens were categorized as malignant melanoma, acquired or congenital benign nevi, blue nevi, spindle and epithelioid cell nevi, and dysplastic nevi. Other processes such as lentigines were excluded. There was a threefold increase in percentage of patients having nevomelanocytic lesions removed (1.5% in 1950 to 4.6% in 1987) compared with total surgical cases over the 37-year period. A progressive increase in numbers and percentages of dysplastic nevi (among nevomelanocytic surgical cases) was noted over a 37-year interval--2 cases (1% of nevomelanocytic cases) in 1950, 4 cases (2%) in 1960, 23 cases (5%) in 1970, and 189 cases (12%) in 1987. These findings confirm the existence of dysplastic nevi by histopathologic criteria as early as 1950 and illustrate the frequencies of various nevomelanocytic surgical specimens among all surgical specimens at four points in time over a 37-year period at a major referral center for pigmented lesions.\r"

We have conducted a study of the prevalence of melanocytic nevi among 1146 white Vancouver (Canada) schoolchildren aged 6 to 18 years. Numbers of nevi per square meter of body surface area increase with age in children of both sexes. Male adolescents have more nevi than female adolescents on the head and neck as well as on the trunk, while prevalence in females is higher on the upper and lower limbs. This distribution parallels that of cutaneous melanoma in British Columbia adults. Nevi are more common in children on intermittently exposed body sites than on constantly or minimally sun-exposed sites. This suggests that exposure to strong intermittent sunlight in childhood (a risk factor for cutaneous melanoma) may also be important in the etiology of acquired benign nevi.\r"

We studied 10 neurofibromas, 10 schwannomas, and 10 partially neurotized melanocytic nevi immunohistochemically using an antibody directed against factor XIIIa to determine if this antibody might provide a useful method of differentiating these lesions. The cases were also stained with S100 protein. All of the neurofibromas stained intensely for factor XIIIa. The proportion of cells staining within the tumors varied from 30% to 70%. In contrast, none of the schwannomas and neurotized nevi studied demonstrated staining of tumor cells with this antibody. S100 protein was expressed by 100% of neurofibromas, schwannomas, and melanocytic nevi. Our findings suggest that factor XIIIa may provide a reliable and practical means of differentiating cutaneous neurofibromas from neurotized nevi and cutaneous schwannomas. Distinguishing between these different tumor types may be important in some clinical situations, particularly with respect to rendering a diagnosis of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis. The differences in the immunohistochemical profiles of neurofibromas and neurotized nevi support the concept that these tumors are histogenetically distinct, despite their similar histologic appearances.\r"

The portion of behavioral change attributable to surgery alone vs surgery plus education was unable to be determined. Despite intensive educational efforts, the noncompliance was 38%. This study identifies a health risk-taking pattern of behavior among those who were noncompliant. Those over age 65 years tended to be less compliant. When the data were analyzed by the transtheoretical model of behavior change, those already acting on some form of sunscreen use prior to this study achieved 100% compliance with increasing to a sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 15 or greater. It is hoped that with more educational efforts those in precontemplative and contemplative phases of behavior can be recruited to take action, and those who acted by acquiring one sun protective behavior will add other behaviors.\r"

Immediate posttreatment comparative photographs showed marked fading or elimination of some dysplastic nevi clinically, and histologic examination of excisional biopsy specimens showed disappearance or reversion to benign nevi in many of the treated lesions.

  ".W": "A lentiginous pattern of intraepidermal melanocytic hyperplasia, with mild to moderate, random cytologic atypia, forms the conventional basis for the histologic definition of a dysplastic nevus. It is proposed here that these changes actually represent the histologic pattern of a nevus in an active phase of radial growth. The lesser degrees of atypia considered by others to be required for the diagnosis are suggested to overlap changes commonly seen in banal nevi and lentigines. This hypothesis allows the parsimonious concept that a nevus, originating as a lentigo, can at the later sequential junctional, compound, or intradermal stages expand peripherally by a resumption or persistence of the lentiginous pattern of proliferation. The random atypia that is seen in such lesions is suggested to be incidental to the proliferative process rather than indicative of dysplasia as conventionally defined. A familial melanoma-associated phenotype could be accommodated in this model by postulating a heritable defect in mechanisms that control the number or sizes of these hyperplastic lesions.\r"

Animals underwent a total exchange transfusion with Poly SFH-P to assess its ability to support hemodynamics and oxygen transport in the absence of red cells. All animals survived the exchange transfusion. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and oxygen consumption (VO2) remained at baseline values at zero hematocrit after the exchange. The final plasma [Hb] at Hct less than 1% was 9.7 +/- 0.4 g/dL. These results are significantly better than previous data with unmodified tetrameric hemoglobin solution (SFH). Poly SFH-P supports life in the absence of red cells. In contrast to SFH, Poly SFH-P achieves a nearly normal [Hb], a longer T1/2, and maintains baseline hemodynamics and oxygen consumption at zero hematocrit. These results document that Poly SFH-P is an effective oxygen carrier that offers greater potential than previous products as a clinically useful red cell substitute.\r"

The present study shows, using video barium contrast esophagograms, that the cause of dysphagia in 60% of these patients is an obstruction to the passage of the swallowed bolus by diaphragmatic impingement on the herniated stomach. Manometrically this was reflected by a double-hump high pressure zone (HPZ) at the gastroesophageal junction, and specifically to the length and amplitude of the distal HPZ and the length of the intervening segment between the two HPZs. The former represents the degree of the diaphragmatic impingement on the herniated stomach and the latter the size of the supradiaphragmatic herniated stomach. Surgical reduction of the hernia resulted in relief of dysphagia in 91% of the patients.\r"

Ulcers greater than 1 cm were more frequent in the greater than 60 year age group, more likely to have stigmata and carried an increased risk of rebleeding and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Biliary obstruction induces a increase in the permeability between blood and bile, and a decrease in the rate of immunoglobulin A (IgA) transport into bile. We investigated the effects of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) on these derangements. PTBD reduced the extent of elevation of the bile-to-serum ratio of Immunoglobulin G (IgG; IgG-BS ratio) in patients with obstructive jaundice. Because IgG is known to be passively transported from serum to bile, the results indicate that PTBD restores the blood-bile barrier function. The IgA-BS ratio/IgG-BS ratio index (IgA/IgG index) and the IgM/IgG index, which indicated the function of selective transport of IgA and IgM into bile, initially decreased and then returned to the normal range 17 days after PTBD in patients who experienced a rapid resolution of hyperbilirubinemia. However these indices remained low in patients who did not experience this resolution. The serum secretory IgA levels in patients who did not experienced rapid resolution of hyperbilirubinemia markedly increased before PTBD. The serum secretory IgA levels in the patients who did and those who did not experience rapid resolution of hyperbilirubinemia, after initially increasing, decreased after PTBD. However the level returned to the control range only in patients who experienced a rapid resolution. These results indicate that the secretory IgA level is a sensitive indicator of hepatobiliary function, and measurement of the level of secretory IgA could predict the effect of PTBD.\r"

Recently we noted an increase in the de novo presentation of outpatients with this disease. Our aim was to characterize this disease in outpatients, identify risk factors, and assess clinical outcome. Therefore a 7-year review of the Yale experience with AAC was undertaken. Forty-seven patients were identified. Seventy-seven per cent (36 of 47 patients) developed AAC at home without evidence of acute illness or trauma, while 23% (11 of 47 patients) developed the disease while hospitalized. Significant vascular disease was observed in 72% of outpatients. A 38% morbidity rate and 6% mortality rate were observed. We conclude that AAC occurs commonly in elderly male outpatients with vascular disease and that these patients incur significant morbidity in association with this condition. AAC should be suspected and prompt surgical management instituted when these patients present with an acute right upper quadrant inflammatory process.\r"

The indicator, called redox tolerance index (RTI), represents a 100-fold cumulative enhancement of ketone body ratio relative to glucose level (100 x delta KBR/delta glucose). The redox tolerance index was significantly different between 31 liver cirrhotics and 10 normal volunteers (p less than 0.001). Subjects were divided into three classes (I: RTI greater than or equal to 1.0, II: 0.5 less than or equal to RTI less than 1.0, III: RTI less than 0.5). Postoperative mortality was significantly different among the three classes in 127 hepatic resections (chi 2 = 9.843, p less than 0.01). Of 97 hepatocellular carcinoma cases, major hepatic resections in class III showed significantly higher postoperative morbidity and mortality rates (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05, respectively). The present findings indicate that RTI based on redox theory is of potential value in predicting posthepatectomy outcome.\r"

Ninety-one resections were performed for neoplasms and 27 were for complicated chronic pancreatitis. The preoperative evaluation, operative technique, and postoperative care of these cases is discussed in detail and compared to the experience of Howard. While there was general agreement on operative technique, there were differences concerning preoperative evaluation (modern imaging methods) and postoperative care (simplification). In this series 21 postoperative complications required seven relaparotomies. Long-term survival after resection for carcinoma was analyzed for 133 consecutive patients who were shown to have true ductal adenocarcinoma. In 76 patients, who had radical (R0-) resections, the actuarial 5-year-survival rate was 36%. In 44 patients, whose R0-resections for pancreatic cancer occurred more than 5 years ago, the actual survival rate was 25%.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was performed on 358 patients to examine the diagnosis, management, and natural history of fish bone ingestion. All patients admitted with the complaint had a thorough oral examination. Flexible endoscopy under local pharyngeal anesthesia would be performed on patients with negative findings. Of 117 fish bones encountered, 103 were removed (direct removal, 21; endoscopic removal, 82) and 12 were inadvertently dislodged. One was missed and the other one necessitated removal with rigid laryngoesophagoscopy under general anesthesia. Morbidity (1%) occurred in patients with triangular bones in the hypopharynx, resulting in one mucosal tear and two lengthy procedures. Mean hospital stay was 7 hours. Prediction of the presence of fish bones by symptoms and radiograph was poor. The location of symptoms, however, was useful in guiding the endoscopist to the site of lodgment. Of patients who refused endoscopy, only one (2.8%) developed retropharyngeal abscess. As compared to those who received endoscopy, 31.8% had fish bones detected. As the yield of fish bone detected was also inversely related to the duration of symptoms, we strongly suspect that most of the unremoved fish bones would be dislodged and passed. However, because of the serious potential complication from fish bone ingestion, we believe that a combination of oral examination followed by flexible endoscopy is indicated in all patients. When triangular bones in the hypopharynx are encountered, rigid laryngoesophagoscopy should be considered. This protocol had safely and effectively dealt with the present series of patients.\r"

Twenty puppies underwent ERPT. These dogs were randomly assigned to three experimental groups or a control group consisting of animals without a myotomy. The myotomies were performed by excising the serosa and muscularis propria of the ileal wall in three different patterns. There was no difference between any of the groups with respect to general health, postoperative weight gain, stool frequency, intestinal transit time, water absorption, electrolyte absorption, barium enemas, neorectal capacity and dimensions, and histology.\r"

Wound infection rates by HIV-1 status were as follows (95% confidence intervals): HIV+ 1.4% (0% to 5%), HIV- 0% (0% to 9%), and procedure before testing HIV+ 1.5% (0% to 6%). There were no significant differences between the wound infection rates of HIV-positive and HIV-negative hemophiliacs nor in the wound infection rate among all three subgroups of patients (p greater than 0.5, Fisher's Exact Test).

This report is concerned with a rapid new method of identifying these vessels intraoperatively. In 9 pigs, a specially designed catheter with platinum and stainless steel electrodes was inserted intrathecally. Saline solution saturated with hydrogen was injected sequentially into arterial ostia at T-15 to L-4 inclusive, and the generated current impulses from the conditioned platinum electrode were recorded. Of 90 potential segmental arteries supplying the spinal cord, 28 gave rise to spinal radicular arteries. Hydrogen-induced current impulses correctly located 25 of the radicular arteries and all those larger than 180 microns in diameter. When injected with indigo carmine, the vessels localized by the hydrogen-induced current impulses filled the entire anterior spinal artery from the low thoracic to the sacral region, whereas injection of the other vessels did not show filling. After refinement and testing for safety, this method has been employed clinically to rapidly localize and reattach routes of critical cord circulation.\r"

We evaluated the effect of antireflux procedures in patients with Barrett's esophagus on the regression of columnar epithelium and dysplasia and its potential protective effect on the subsequent development of carcinoma. Of the 241 patients with Barrett's esophagus treated at the Lahey Clinic from 1973 to 1989, 37 patients underwent an antireflux operation. Regression was defined as histological evidence of regenerating squamous mucosa that completely or partially replaced the columnar epithelium. Improvement in lower esophageal sphincter pressure to 12 mm Hg or greater occurred in 19 of 26 patients (73%) who had perioperative manometry. Symptomatic relief of esophagitis occurred in 34 of 37 patients (92%). Four patients had partial regression with regenerating squamous mucosa juxtaposed with areas of columnar epithelium. Carcinoma developed in 3 of 37 patients (8.1%). One patient had recurrence of severe symptoms of reflux esophagitis before development of carcinoma. Patients with Barrett's esophagus who have undergone a successful antireflux operation with symptomatic relief and evidence of improvement in lower esophageal sphincter pressures rarely show regression of Barrett's mucosa and may still be at risk for development of carcinoma. Therefore, the indications for antireflux operation in Barrett's esophagus should remain the same as for other patients with gastroesophageal reflux, but yearly endoscopic and histological surveillance should be continued postoperatively.\r"

We compared the relationship between LVVO2 and P-VA with the relationships between LVVO2 and stroke work and between LVVO2 and the systolic stress integral. Using the methods presented, P-VA can be measured in vivo (n = 123) in both preischemic and postischemic hearts. Ischemia increases the slopes of the relationship between LVVO2 and P-VA and between stroke work and the systolic stress integral, and reduces the oxygen utilization efficiency of stroke work to less than 2%. Coefficients of determination for the relationship between LVVO2 and P-VA are, in general, higher than those between LVVO2 and either stroke work or the systolic stress integral. We conclude that systolic P-VA can be measured in vivo using recently developed methods and that it is applicable to postischemic \"stunned\" hearts. Because P-VA and LVVO2 can be converted into identical energy units, calculation of P-VA permits calculation of myocardial oxygen utilization efficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Retrograde delivery of cardioplegic solutions has recently been the subject of renewed interest, but the reliability of this technique has not been assessed in large clinical series. From 1980 to 1989, we used retrograde coronary sinus perfusion as the exclusive means of cardioplegia delivery in 500 consecutive patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, either isolated (359 patients) or combined with another valve or coronary procedure (141 patients). The coronary sinus was always cannulated under direct vision after bicaval cannulation with snaring. Cold crystalloid cardioplegia was delivered retrogradely at an average flow rate of 100 mL/min in conjunction with topical and systemic (25 degrees C) hypothermia. The mean cross-clamp time was 83 +/- 23 minutes (+/- the standard deviation). There were 31 hospital deaths (6.2%), 20 of which were cardiac related. Transient hemodynamic instability (defined as a need for inotropic agents for less than 24 hours postoperatively) occurred in 16 patients (3.2%), whereas a true low-output syndrome developed in 60 patients (12%). The incidence of clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias and of permanent conduction defects was 7.4% and 1.2%, respectively. There were three nonfatal coronary venous injuries during our early experience. We conclude that coronary sinus perfusion is a safe and effective means of delivering cardioplegia in aortic valve operations. While providing a degree of myocardial protection similar to that reported with anterograde cardioplegia, the coronary sinus technique offers distinct advantages, in particular, the avoidance of perfusion-related coronary artery complications and the opportunity to repeat cardioplegia administration without interrupting the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The operative rationale was to dissect the AV node from most of its atrial inputs (AV node \"skeletonization\") with the intent of altering the perinodal substrate and preventing reentry. The anteroseptal and posteroseptal regions were initially approached epicardially to facilitate identification of anatomical structures. Under normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, the right atrial septum was mobilized and the intermediate AV node was exposed anterior to the tendon of Todaro. Atrioventricular node conduction was monitored electrocardiographically throughout the procedure. Ablation of concomitant accessory pathways was done prior to AV node skeletonization. Thirty-two patients aged 9 to 67 years (mean age, 30 years) underwent operation. Five patients had concomitant accessory pathways in addition to AV node reentry. At electrophysiological study before discharge, no patient had AV block although anterograde and retrograde Wenckebach cycle lengths were significantly prolonged. Six patients had retrograde AV block. Twenty-nine patients are free from arrhythmia and require no antiarrhythmic medication after a follow-up of 1 month to 45 months (mean follow-up, 17 months). Three patients had recurrence of tachycardia ten days, 2 months, and 7 months postoperatively. All patients subsequently had a successful reoperation.\r"

Thirty mongrel dogs underwent left lung autotransplantation. The bronchial anastomosis was wrapped with omentum (n = 9), intercostal muscle pedicle (n = 9), or internal mammary artery pedicle grafts (n = 6). Six control animals underwent bronchial anastomosis without an external wrap. Bronchial revascularization by capillary ingrowth from the pedicle to the bronchial submucosal plexus was demonstrated with all three types of vascular pedicle grafts; however, more consistent and confluent vascular ingrowth was provided by internal mammary artery pedicle grafts. Additionally, the bronchial anastomotic cross-sectional area was significantly better in the internal mammary artery group (84.5 +/- 3.3) as compared with that of the omental (68.4 +/- 8.3), intercostal muscle (66.9 +/- 10.9), or control groups (70.2 +/- 7.6). An internal mammary artery pedicle graft and the presence of dense confluent submucosal vascular ingrowth from any pedicle graft were independently predictive (p less than 0.05) of minimizing bronchial anastomotic narrowing. These data are consistent with previous findings suggesting that omental and intercostal muscle pedicle grafts promote early bronchial revascularization; moreover, the data demonstrate the superiority of an internal mammary artery pedicle graft to provide submucosal vascular ingrowth and to minimize anastomotic stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Between April 1979 and May 1989, 86 patients underwent emergency operation for acute type A aortic dissection. Sixty-four (74.4%) survived. None of the survivors died of late aortic complications. Fifty-eight patients were followed 3 months to 10 years (mean follow-up, 3.2 years) postoperatively with computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography. Dilatation of the distal aorta (diameter size range, 6 to 10.5 cm) developed in 10 patients (17%). Six patients underwent replacement of the descending aorta 1 month to 21 months (mean period, 8.5 months) after aortic dissection repair. Two of them had third-stage thoracoabdominal replacement. In 2 patients, replacement of the descending aorta was scheduled; 1 died before reoperation and 1 refused the procedure. Two patients underwent aortic arch replacement; it is scheduled for another (fourth stage). There were no deaths among the patients having reoperation. The rate of indications for reoperation on the aorta downstream from the original repair 1 month to 6 years 4 months (median time, 9 months) after primary surgical intervention for acute type A aortic dissection was 24% (14 reoperations in 10 of 58 patients). This study underscores the importance of close follow-up of patients having operation for acute type A aortic dissection. Early recognition of progressive downstream aortic pathology permits effective prevention of aortic rupture and timely reoperation.\r"

To evaluate this technology, we randomly assigned 100 consecutive patients who were to undergo an elective coronary bypass procedure and had normal clotting studies into the experimental (plasmapheresis) or the control group. Characteristics of both groups were similar, including average age (61.4 years versus 61.3 years [experimental versus control group]), sex (78% male versus 74% male), preoperative weight (80.9 kg versus 80.2 kg), preoperative red cell mass (1,989 mL versus 1,890 mL), perfusion time (102 minutes versus 106 minutes), and coagulation studies. Both internal mammary arteries were used in 68% of the patients. All patients had preoperative and postoperative blood volume determinations and complete clotting studies. Sixty-two variables related to bleeding were analyzed. Strict indications for transfusion were a hemoglobin level less than 7 g/100 mL in patients younger than 70 years and a hemoglobin level less than 8 g/100 mL in patients older than 70 years. The group receiving intraoperative plasmapheresis had a significant reduction in operative red cell mass loss (1,050 +/- 43 mL versus 1,226 +/- 61 mL; p = 0.021), a reduction in the average homologous transfusion (0.67 +/- 0.15 unit versus 1.8 +/- 0.25 units; p = 0.0002), and an increase in the percentage of patients not requiring blood transfusions (66% versus 32%; p = 0.001). This technique is useful in reducing postoperative blood loss and homologous transfusions.\r"

There was one hospital death. Six patients died 6 to 35 months postoperatively: 1 from recurrence, 2 from generalized metastases, and 3 with both local recurrent and metastatic disease. One other patient died free of disease 6 weeks postoperatively of pneumonia. The remaining 3 patients are alive 12 to 84 months after operation with excellent rehabilitation and good quality of life. We conclude that one-stage surgical resection and reconstruction for high cervical carcinoma of the esophagus offers good palliation and possible long-term survival with acceptable operative risk.\r"

To accurately investigate this important subgroup of patients, we analyzed our recent experience with truly emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. From January 1984 to January 1989, 117 patients underwent true emergency bypass grafting for acute refractory coronary artery ischemia. Clinical deterioration was associated with failure of percutaneous angioplasty in 37 patients and instability during diagnostic catheterization in 13 patients. Refractory ischemia developed in the remaining patients while on the ward or in the intensive care unit. All operations were performed within four hours of surgical consultation, most within one hour. Overall in-hospital operative mortality was 14.5% (17/117), and 76.5% of deaths (13/17) were due to cardiac-related causes. Major morbidity occurred in 35.9% (42/117). Univariate analysis isolated ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, need for inotropic support, use of an intraaortic balloon pump, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation as risk factors for operative mortality. Stepwise multivariate analysis confirmed that previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and reoperation were independently significant risk factors. Age, sex, diabetes, left main disease, and peripheral vascular disease had no significant impact on the prognosis. The 4% operative mortality (2/50) for patients taken directly to the operating room from the catheterization suite was significantly lower than the 22.4% mortality (15/67) associated with emergencies arising on the ward or intensive care unit (p less than 0.01). A logistic risk equation developed from this population accurately modeled operative mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Primary tumors (102 benign and 12 malignant) were found in 114 patients and metastatic tumors in 19. Symptoms included congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, emboli, and chest pain. Diagnosis was accomplished through angiography, echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Operative treatment encompassed techniques ranging from biopsy to complete excision (including hypothermic circulatory arrest and cardiac autotransplantation) depending on the site of disease and the extent of involvement. Overall operative survival was 91%. Twelve patients died early (within 30 days of operation), and follow-up was obtained for 110 (90.9%) of the remaining 121 survivors (total patient-years of follow-up, 572.8; mean follow-up, 5.2 years). Of the 20 patients who died late, 15 had malignant disease. Operative survival for patients with primary cardiac malignancies and for those with metastatic disease was 83% and 68.4%, respectively, with 3 and 5 patients, respectively, still living. We advocate an aggressive surgical approach, especially in patients with benign tumors, who can expect an excellent outcome. For patients with malignant or metastatic disease, palliation and cure are also possible if aggressive surgical actions are taken.\r"

Five patients had positive bacterial cultures from excised valves, and all had clinical findings of uncontrolled infection while receiving appropriate antibiotics. Homograft valves (four) or valved conduits (six) were implanted for treatment of sepsis (6 patients), congestive heart failure (3) or recurrent emboli (1 patient), and complicating native (5 patients) or prosthetic valve (5) endocarditis. Staphylococci (6 patients), streptococci (3), and Candida (1) were infecting organisms. Preoperatively, Doppler echocardiography showed aortic regurgitation in all patients. At operation, 9 patients had gross vegetations, 9 had single or multiple abscess cavities, and 5 had pericarditis. Complex reconstruction of the aortic valve and annulus with homograft conduits was necessary in 6 patients (3 with previous aortoventriculoplasty). Two early deaths (ventricular failure, perioperative stroke) occurred. Mean follow-up of all operative survivors was 2.1 years (range, 0.6 to 3.6 years), and one late death resulted from arrhythmia. Homograft valve regurgitation increased in 1 patient, and 7 late survivors are asymptomatic. No patient has had recurrence of endocarditis. We conclude that cryopreserved homograft aortic valve/root replacement is an effective method for management of active endocarditis complicated by annular destruction.\r"

Coronary vascular resistance was less than normal throughout the first ten minutes of controlled reperfusion, but there was a gradual increase throughout this period.

In 2 of the patients, the initial symptoms of dissection developed while they were lifting weights. Two patients had a history of hypertension and 2 had previously used anabolic steroids. All 4 were successfully treated surgically. Histopathology showed aortic medial changes in all 4. We believe that the hemodynamic stresses of weight lifting, namely, a rapid increase in systemic arterial blood pressure without a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance, in combination with aortic medial degeneration may have contributed to the development of the aortic dissection.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective evaluation of 333 consecutive patients undergoing isolated mitral valve replacement between 1982 and 1985 was performed to identify the predictors of survival and valve failure. Follow-up between 2 and 6 years postoperatively (mean, 32 +/- 17 months) was 98% complete. Four prostheses were inserted to permit a prospective evaluation of alternative valves: Bjork-Shiley mechanical (n = 118), Ionescu-Shiley pericardial (n = 146), Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 38), and Hancock pericardial (n = 31). Hospital mortality was 6%, and actuarial survival at 5 years was 74% +/- 5%. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified advancing age (less than 40 years, 88% +/- 7%; greater than 70 years, 50% +/- 14%) and poor left ventricular function (ejection fraction less than 0.20, 62% +/- 17%; ejection fraction greater than 0.60, 80% +/- 7%) as independent predictors of postoperative survival. Freedom from structural valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve endocarditis, reoperation, and valve-related mortality and morbidity were 86% +/- 4%, 91% +/- 4%, 81% +/- 4%, and 72% +/- 5%, respectively, at 5 years. The actuarial incidence of valve failure was inordinately high with the Hancock pericardial valve (p less than 0.05). Freedom from thromboembolic events (78% +/- 8% at 5 years) was significantly lower in patients with poor ventricular function (ejection fraction (less than 0.20, 54% +/- 20%; ejection fraction greater than 0.60, 73% +/- 11%; p less than 0.05). Survival after mitral valve replacement was determined by age and left ventricular function. Premature failure of the Hancock pericardial valve resulted in an unacceptable rate of valve-related complications.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated potential distribution mapping as a method for localizing the site of origin of ventricular tachycardia (VT). In contrast to conventional activation time maps, potential distribution maps require less editing and thus can be more automated and rapidly processed for interpretation of multiple beats of VT. As a series of potential distribution maps during VT is required for detailed analysis, an on-line computerized system was designed to display potential distribution maps sequentially at 1-ms intervals as a color movie. Potential distribution maps and activation time maps were constructed from 182 epicardial and endocardial unipolar electrodes during 12 episodes of reproducible monomorphic VT in 9 dogs four to six days after experimental myocardial infarction (mean cycle length, 162 +/- 21 ms). At the onset of each depolarization during VT, a potential minimum abruptly developed on the surviving epicardium and another on the surviving endocardium of the left ventricle, both immediately adjacent to the subendocardial infarct. These two minima on the initial potential distribution maps corresponded to the sites of earliest epicardial and endocardial activation breakthrough recorded on the activation time maps. These two minima subsequently expanded or moved into the adjacent area and coincided with the spread of activation fronts on the epicardial and endocardial surfaces. Thus, the rapid display of sequential, computerized potential distribution maps of multiple beats of VT provides a dynamic means of identifying the site of origin of VT, and therefore should facilitate intraoperative mapping.\r"

It was developed originally as the diagnostic interview for the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) survey. Because it adheres to DSM-III and can be used by lay interviewers, thus making it practical for studies involving large samples, it has been used for other population surveys in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. This investigation compares the epidemiology of DSM-III-defined alcohol abuse and addiction in DIS-based population surveys cross-nationally (in St Louis, Mo; Edmonton, Canada; Puerto Rico; Taipei City, Taiwan; and South Korea). We found considerable variation in the lifetime prevalence of alcoholism but a similarity in the age of onset, the symptomatic expression, and the associated risk factors. We also found an inverse correlation between the prevalence of alcoholism and the strength of the association of the risk factors we examined. The work described herein demonstrates the utility of consistent definition and method in cross-cultural psychiatric research. The substantive findings have implications for the definition of alcoholism and for a better understanding of genetic and environmental interactions in its etiology.\r"

Interviews with 171 consecutive primary alcoholic men entering an alcohol treatment program revealed that age at onset of alcoholism was correlated with alcohol, drug, and childhood criminality problem histories. Neither classification of these alcoholics into discrete type 1 and type 2 categories nor placing them along a continuum of type 2 characteristics was consistently associated with severity of clinical histories. These findings underscore the clinical importance of age at onset and suggest the possibility that the type 2 prototype might represent a separate diagnosis, antisocial personality disorder, and not alcoholism itself.\r"

Alcoholics who were tested at 1 week of abstinence (n = 11) demonstrated a significantly attenuated corticotropin response to oCRH compared with their response at 3 weeks of abstinence. Nine of these alcoholic patients demonstrated a significantly blunted corticotropin response at both 1 and 3 weeks of abstinence compared with controls (n = 15). A markedly exaggerated corticotropin response to oCRH, associated with tachycardia, was exhibited by 2 alcoholics at both 1 and 3 weeks of abstinence. Alcoholics who were abstinent greater than 3 weeks did not differ in their response to oCRH compared with controls. Controls demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between baseline cortisol levels and the cortisol response to oCRH. This correlation was not evident in any of the alcoholic groups, including those patients who were abstinent greater than 6 months. There was a positive correlation between cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of CRH and corticotropin in all patient groups. These findings indicated that alcoholics have significantly altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning up to 3 weeks following the cessation of drinking, with a more subtle impairment present for greater than 6 months following abstinence.\r"

Chippers' blood nicotine levels increased significantly, in amounts equaling those of dependent smokers. Assays of cotinine (a long-lasting nicotine metabolite) also suggested that chippers' per-cigarette nicotine absorption equaled that of dependent smokers. Chippers' cotinine levels were also compared with those of heavy smokers (38 cigarettes per day) whose consumption was reduced to 5 cigarettes per day in a previously published study. The heavy smokers compensated by tripling their per-cigarette nicotine intake. Chippers did not seem to be compensating; their cotinine values equaled those expected when regular smokers were not compensating for reduced cigarette availability.\r"

The mechanism of light therapy may involve shifts in the timing (phase) of circadian rhythms. In this study, morning light exposure (which shifts rhythms earlier) was compared with evening light exposure (which shifts rhythms later) in a double-blind, crossover design. The onset of melatonin secretion in the evening was measured under dim light conditions as a marker for circadian timing (phase) before and after each treatment. Eight patients with winter depression and five control subjects were studied. Morning light was found to be significantly better than evening light in reducing depressive symptoms. At baseline, there was a trend for the onset of melatonin production to be later in the patients than in the controls. Morning light shifted the melatonin onset significantly earlier in the patients but not the controls. Our findings suggest that patients with winter depression have circadian rhythms that are abnormally delayed and that bright light therapy benefits winter depression by providing a corrective advance.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous reports have been published concerning linkage of X-chromosome markers of the q28 region (including protan and deutan color blindness [CB] and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) to manic-depressive illness. We studied nine bipolar pedigrees (in which there was no male-to-male transmission) in an attempt to detect linkage, using three tightly linked polymorphic DNA loci, DXS15, DXS52 and F8C (factor 8 gene), all of which are closely linked to the CB and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase classic Xq28 markers. Linkage to this region of Xq28 could be excluded unequivocally in these nine families. When these data were combined with our earlier series of bipolar pedigrees, informative for either protan or deutan CB, a total of 14 bipolar pedigrees have been studied, with no evidence of linkage or heterogeneity. At a recombination fraction (theta) of 1%, this series had greater than 95% power to detect linkage if only 50% of the pedigrees studied were linked to the CB region. Our failure to confirm the previously reported linkage of manic-depressive illness to the CB region of the X chromosome indicates that this linkage is not as common as previously suggested.\r"

In the present study we tested for linkage between alpha-haptoglobin and panic disorder in 10 new pedigrees and excluded a gene for panic disorder from 6 centimorgans (recombination fraction, 0.06) surrounding the alpha-haptoglobin locus. The data were analyzed under a variety of assumptions about the transmission of panic disorder, and linkage was excluded by all genetic models but one. When lod scores from the present set of 10 pedigrees were pooled with those from the first 26, no evidence of genetic heterogeneity was found, and the maximum lod score was 0.67 at a recombination fraction of 0.17. Taken as a whole, the present findings do not support the presence of a disease gene for panic disorder closely linked to the alpha-haptoglobin locus on chromosome 16q22.\r"

Participating pathologists who provided data from their practices volunteered for a pilot study of Q-Probes, a modular quality assurance program of the College of American Pathologists, Skokie, III. During 4 weeks, 186 pathologists evaluated 1952 frozen-section cases and deferred diagnoses to the final permanent sections in 77 cases (3.9%). Concordance between frozen-section and the final histologic diagnoses was 96.5%; whereas the mean and median concordance rates for participating institutions were 96.8% and 97.4%, respectively. Of 67 discordant diagnoses, 29 occurred from sampling of nonrepresentative tissue specimens, and 29 from diagnostic misinterpretations. The pathologists indicated that the diagnostic discordance had little or no effect on patient care in 94% of cases. We conclude that the North American pathologists studied interpret frozen sections with exceedingly high accuracy, approximating that reported from teaching hospitals.\r"

Cases with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis were excluded so that the effects of diffuse scarring of the lung on the development of neoplasia were eliminated. Of 70 specimens with various types of pulmonary carcinomas, 15 were found to have coexistent typical or atypical AEH lesions. No area of transition from AEH to neoplasm was found. The immunohistochemistry studies showed significant differences in the reactions of carcinoembryonic and blood group antigens between typical and atypical AEH lesions, but no significant differences could be obtained between atypical AEH lesions and adenocarcinoma. However, the morphometry of the mean nuclear areas revealed a highly significant difference between atypical AEH lesions and adenocarcinoma. Electron microscopy showed many Clara granules in atypical AEH cells. The results did not prove that AEH lesions are precancerous, but the presence of Clara granules in atypical AEH cells raises speculation on the histogenetic relationship between AEH and pulmonary adenocarcinoma.\r"

Lectin histochemistry was not found to be of diagnostic value, since the MCT did not display any distinct lectin-binding pattern. This approach demonstrated that all MCTs, irrespective of their histologic appearance, consist of polarized cells, arranged into microfollicles that can be demonstrated readily by electron microscopy. We conclude that all MCTs form follicles, some visible by light microscopy, while others are submicroscopic and apparent only on histochemical staining. Because of the histochemical and ultrastructural similarities between solid MCTs and tumors with a follicular pattern, the latter should not be considered a distinct variant of C-cell neoplasia.\r"

Except for mild nonspecific lymphoid tissue reactions, no lesions were noted that would indicate HIV-1 infection. DNA from all viruses was detected in some lymphoid cells. The amount of DNA for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus type 6 corresponded to that observed for clinically occult latent infection. Lymphoid cells carrying HIV-1 DNA were even less frequent. Cells positive for HIV-1 were noted in the lamina propria of the large intestine in three male homosexuals and in one female prostitute. The cells were arranged similar to antigen-presenting cells. The present findings are consistent with current theories regarding the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated disease.\r"

Patients with chronic periaortitis, subclinical chronic periaortitis, and ischemic heart disease, and \"elderly control\" individuals were compared with young, healthy adults. Provided that precautions were taken to prevent oxidation of the low-density lipoprotein during the assay, antibodies were not found to native human low-density lipoprotein. Antibodies to oxidized low-density lipoprotein or ceroid, usually both, were detected in all 20 patients with clinical chronic periaortitis, in 17 of 20 patients with subclinical chronic periaortitis, in 12 of 20 patients with ischemic heart disease, and in 10 of 20 elderly control subjects. Binding inhibition studies showed cross-reactions between oxidized low-density lipoprotein and ceroid. Western blotting after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that in some patients with clinical chronic periaortitis, these antibodies were directed against breakdown products of apolipoprotein B that resulted from oxidation of low-density lipoprotein. Antibodies to oxidized low-density lipoprotein or ceroid were not detected in healthy young adults. These findings show that chronic periaortitis is accompanied by autoallergy to ceroid, which is probably at least partly composed of low-density lipoprotein oxidized within the human atherosclerotic plaque, and that a number of middle-aged and elderly people without chronic periaortitis also have such antibodies.\r"

The availability of instrumentation providing an automated platelet count would have decreased the number of patients experiencing a change in management to 5. In no instance did physicians believe that an individual patient's clinical outcome would have been altered by a knowledge of the unexpected abnormalities or the anticipated management changes. In an ambulatory adult population with normal hematology profiles, there is limited clinical value in pursuing further studies, such as a white blood cell differential count or an examination of the red blood cell morphology.\r"

With the risk classification system in effect at the time of the study, 32 (9.4%) of 342 patient serum specimens assayed for cholesterol were classified differently based solely on the method of data reduction. Thus, recalibration of our cholesterol assay system contributed to greater imprecision and to discrepancies in classification of patients' risk levels.\r"

We describe the morphologic features and antigenic expression of a population of ductular hepatocytes identified in a patient with end-stage cirrhosis resulting from hepatitis B infection and secondary biliary cirrhosis. By conventional light microscopy and electron microscopy, ductular hepatocytes were seen to form pseudoductules within periportal areas. Using immunohistochemical methods, these ductular hepatocytes were found to be positive for both the hepatitis B surface antigen and bile duct epithelial cytokeratin, phenotypic markers classically restricted to expression on hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium, respectively. These findings show definitively that ductular hepatocytes are intermediate cells bearing morphologic and phenotypic characteristics of both hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium. The presence of these cells indicates the existence of facultative stem cells in the adult mammalian liver.\r"

However, a minority of laboratories utilize only an immediate spin crossmatch as their routine major crossmatch, possibly because contemporary antibody screening tests occasionally miss detecting some unexpected antibodies, and these missed antibodies are more often detected by the anti-human globulin crossmatch than by the immediate spin crossmatch. In the present study, 20 hospitals were surveyed to determine how often an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction would occur when only an immediate spin crossmatch was used as the major crossmatch method. During the study period, 1.3 million immediate spin crossmatches were performed, and five patients experienced acute overt hemolytic transfusion reactions that were believed to be caused by antibodies that were missed by both the antibody screening test and immediate spin crossmatch (one hemolytic event per 250,000 immediate spin crossmatches). The implicated antibodies were anti-Jka, anti-Wra, anti-C, anti-c, and anti-Kpa. These survey data demonstrate that the routine crossmatching of blood using an immediate spin crossmatch may rarely result in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction if the antibody screening cells used during pretransfusion compatibility testing fail to detect some clinically significant red blood cell antibodies.\r"

Abnormal blood flow is the proposed mechanism for the hepatic fibrosis and nodular regeneration. Hepatic fibrosis, by causing stenosis of large intrahepatic bile ducts, bile stasis, and secondary infection, is the hypothesized mechanism for calculus formation. Hepatolithiasis ultimately caused death from acute bacterial cholangitis and septicemia.\r"

The tumor mass was detected by a computed tomographic scan during an investigation of the cause of chest pain in a 58-year-old man. Biopsy of the mass showed findings compatible with either a large-cell lymphoma or a granulocytic sarcoma. The latter was confirmed by naphthol-ASD-chloracetate esterase stain and electron microscopic examination. Immunologic study of the tumor mass showed expressions of membrane/cytoplasmic CD 13 and CD 15 antigens. In addition, the tumor cells coexpressed CD 19, although all other T- and B-cell-associated antigens were absent. Cytogenetic study showed translocation t(1;7)(q11;q11) with a net deletion of the entire long arm of chromosome 7 and duplication of the long arm of chromosome 1. Peripheral blood examination showed typical leukoerythroblastosis with teardrop poikilocytosis, large hypogranular platelets, and 0.11 myeloblasts. A bilateral iliac bone marrow biopsy at this time showed osteomyelosclerosis. The patient was treated with hydroxyurea followed by local irradiation, resulting in marked reduction in the size of the tumor and in the pain. He was asymptomatic without any progression in hematologic parameters 10 months after the initial diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "I suggest restructuring general surgical residencies to facilitate training of surgical specialists and subspecialists. Basic surgical education for 1 or 2 years should provide a foundation of fundamental cognitive, technical, and patient management skills useful for all surgery residents, regardless of discipline. Intermediate surgical education for an additional 2 or 3 years should amplify cognitive, technical, and clinical skills and senior responsibility in general surgery for individuals entering a general surgical subspecialty or for advanced general surgery training. Residents seeking a career in advanced general surgery would take 2 additional years of training in advanced surgery. Such individuals could pursue additional subspecialty training and research experience to qualify as academic surgical scientists. Implementation of such innovations in general surgical education awaits the cooperative joint efforts of appropriate accrediting and certifying organizations, specialty societies, and surgical program directors.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic blood flow and splanchnic oxygen consumption were measured in 16 injured (n = 6) or septic (n = 10) patients and compared with values in 16 normal volunteers. Sepsis and injury appeared to stimulate an increase in blood flow and oxygen utilization, with the highest levels observed in the septic group. Patients with sepsis exhibited a 72% and 60% increase in hepatic blood flow and splanchnic oxygen consumption, respectively, compared with normal volunteers. Application of these data to the Krogh-Erlang tissue model indicates that despite an increase in oxygen delivery to the splanchnic bed during sepsis, it becomes more sensitive to hypoxic/ischemic events compared with other patient groups. This is indicated by a reduced centrilobular and increased critical oxygen tension. The major factor responsible for this is the regional hypermetabolism present in sepsis. This analysis emphasizes the critical importance of maintaining oxygen transport in critically ill patients with sepsis.\r"

Plasma levels of Cg A, pepsinogen group I, and gastrin were measured in 31 patients with gastrinoma. Mean Cg A level in 10 patients with gastrinoma who were not operated on was 169 +/- 32 ng/mL, while in 9 control patients it was 28 +/- 5 ng/mL. In 18 patients with gastrinoma with residual tumor after total gastrectomy, the mean Cg A level was 45 +/- 6 ng/mL, and in 10 patients with normal gastrin levels after total gastrectomy and tumor excision, the mean Cg A level was 40 +/- 4 ng/mL. In 7 patients in whom pregastrectomy and postgastrectomy Cg A levels were measured, the mean reduction was 94 +/- 27 ng/mL, or 66%. There was no correlation between Cg A levels and amount of tumor, presence of metastases, or multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome. There was a significant correlation between Cg A and pepsinogen I levels but no correlation between Cg A and gastrin levels. The results suggest that the elevated plasma Cg A levels in patients with gastrinoma are determined primarily by the trophic effects of gastrin on gastric enterochromaffinlike cells rather than by corelease from the gastrin-producing tumor itself.\r"

Gallbladder volume was regulated by varying balloon volume from empty to just beyond physiologic distention. Cystic duct resistance was not affected by balloon volume under basal or stimulated conditions or by the direction of perfusate flow.

A pancreaticoduodenectomy has educational value since complex pancreatic operations are demanding and important to the training of surgical residents. Increased pancreaticoduodenectomy experience (per surgeon) has been associated with improved outcomes. We examined the hypothesis that residents who are supervised by faculty surgeons can perform pancreaticoduodenectomies with acceptable outcomes. From 1976 to 1987, 127 pancreatic resections were performed by 81 residents who were supervised by 15 faculty surgeons in four teaching hospitals. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed on 61 patients. All residents served as an operating surgeon on a pancreatic resection, and 58 (82%) performed pancreaticoduodenectomies. The mortality for the pancreaticoduodenectomies was 8%, with a 36% major complication rate. A pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed safely by residents under supervision. A review of the results identifies the means of improving outcomes. These results justify the preservation of a pancreaticoduodenectomy as an important experience for residents.\r"

A total of 981 proteins were quantitatively identified. In the highly metastatic lines, 13 proteins were present in statistically significant greater quantities, while 4 proteins were present in statistically significant greater quantities in the cell lines with a low metastatic potential. Two proteins were unique to the highly metastatic lines, while 16 proteins were unique to the lines with a low metastatic potential. These results suggest that there are considerable quantitative and qualitative differences in the cellular proteins of human pancreatic cancer cell lines with a varying metastatic potential and imply a biochemical basis to tumor heterogeneity and metastases.\r"

Coagulation factors were measured before and on the first and third day after the placement of a Denver peritoneovenous shunt; 1 to 10 L of ascites was removed at operation. Levels of platelets, antithrombin III, plasminogen, antiplasmin, fibrinogen, and factors V and VIII decreased by the first postoperative day but did not change further through the third day. The levels of fibrinolytic split products increased on day 1 but were lower by day 3. The platelet count reduction by the third day correlated with the hematocrit change (-0.031). The prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times remained normal postoperatively. The patterns of change were similar for patients with positive (n = 18) and negative (n = 17) ascites cytologic findings, with elevated (n = 24) and normal (n = 11) preoperative fibrinolytic split product levels, and elevated bilirubin value (greater than 25 mumol/L; n = 9), and no jaundice (n = 26). Bleeding did not occur. The data indicated that plasminogen-rather than thromboplastin-activated fibrinolysis occurred and that platelet reduction was largely dilutional. The reactions were not progressive when ascites was removed operatively.\r"

Blood-flow velocity of the dorsal metatarsal artery was measured by ultrasound Doppler. Resting dorsal metatarsal artery velocity and capillary blood velocity of atherosclerotic subjects were lower than those of nonatherosclerotic smokers and nonsmokers. The dorsal metatarsal artery velocity and capillary blood velocity increased in each group following occlusion. Peak postocclusion dorsal metatarsal artery velocity was lower in the atherosclerotic subjects, but peak capillary blood velocity was not significantly different among groups. Atherosclerosis does not alter the mechanisms of reactive hyperemia in either the macrocirculation or the microcirculation. The magnitude of hyperemia is diminished at the macrocirculatory level.\r"

We therefore examined specific genes in approximately 100 human colon cancer cell lines using complementary DNA probes and found profound alterations and heterogenity of gene expression in human colorectal carcinoma. Our data imply that understanding human colorectal cancer will not be accomplished by studying one or two oncogenes in a limited number of cell lines or fresh human tissue. More appropriate postulates of transformation to dictate experimental design may include the investigation of proposed three-dimensional structural changes of interface chromatin or other generalized structural relationships that could predispose to an aberrant gene expression program during transformation. Furthermore, focusing on mechanisms of initiation and defining the molecular genetic markers of gastrointestinal mucosal initiation should lead to a more focused set of genetic, rather than epigenetic, mechanisms that underlie oncogenic transformation.\r"

The variables used were admission Glasgow Coma Score, base excess (or deficit), arterial lactate, Injury Severity Score, and initial 24-hour volume of blood required for replacement. Each variable was modeled as a predictor of survival alone and in combination, using a linear logistic model. In any two-variable combination, Glasgow Coma Score had a high likelihood ratio for prediction representing the influence of brain injury. But as a single variable reflecting the probability of death, both base excess (LD50 = -11.8 mmol/L) and initial 24-hour volume of blood (LD50 = 5.4 L) were highly significant. A combined logistic model of admission Glasgow Coma Score and base excess had the greatest likelihood of accurate prediction of outcome: P death = e lambda/l + e lambda; where lambda = -0.21(Glasgow Coma Score) -0.147(base excess) + 0.285. Testing of this predictive model on data from 323 additional patients with multiple trauma who had pelvic fracture as their index injury also showed it to be a highly significant early predictor of outcome.\r"

The APACHE II score did not predict the development of multiple organ failure syndrome or mortality with clinical utility and significantly underestimated the potential for the development of multiple organ failure syndrome. Factors that did predict the development of multiple organ failure syndrome and mortality were the time-dependent changes in the PaO2-to-fraction of inspired oxygen ratio and serum lactate, creatinine, and bilirubin levels. Better markers of cell injury are needed for use in decision making and quality assurance analysis in surgical patients.\r"

In the first of these two cases the patient had emigrated from Jamaica and was exposed to \"bush trees,\" but no chemical measurements were done. The second patient had consumed a large amount of comfrey teas, which were shown to contain high levels of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. These two cases add further weight to the existing evidence of the toxic effect of these alkaloids, and also demonstrate the effectiveness of hepatic and portal decompression.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive study of 38 demented patients and 15 control subjects, 11 of 27 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 8 of 11 patients with vascular dementia had significant periventricular hyperintensities. Memory and language testing in the early investigation of dementia is useful to distinguish patients with or without periventricular hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. Patients without periventricular hyperintensities are worse on memory and conceptualization tests than patients with periventricular hyperintensities, who tend to be worse on comprehension and attention tests. These differences in cognitive pattern are present between patients with different pathogenesis who are otherwise matched for dementia severity. Language and some nonverbal cognitive deficits correlate with the extent of cortical and ventricular atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between white-matter lesions (WMLs), demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging, and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured with dynamic positron emission tomography and [18F] fluoromethane, was investigated in 20 patients with atherosclerotic disease of the internal carotid artery. There was no correlation between the extent of small patchy WMLs and hemispheric CBF, but hemispheric CBF was significantly reduced in 5 patients with multiple large or confluent lesions. Distinct focal cortical CBF reductions were observed when large WMLs (greater than 5 mm) were located directly beneath the cortex, whereas large WMLs in deeper white matter were associated with a more diffuse decrease of cortical perfusion. There was no evidence of preferential CBF reduction in vascular border zones with increasing severity of WMLs or stenosis of the internal carotid artery. The side of previous transient ischemic symptoms correlated significantly with hemispheric CBF asymmetries, but not with asymmetries of WMLs and internal carotid artery stenosis. It can be concluded from these results that the presence of small patchy WMLs shown by magnetic resonance imaging cannot be used as evidence of impaired cerebral perfusion, while large lesions indicate clinically relevant cerebrovascular disease affecting cortical blood flow.\r"

We compared these two populations with respect to their neuropsychological profiles. Seventeen subjects with tumors were individually matched to subjects with unilateral strokes on the basis of lesion location. Despite close matching of lesions, there were major differences in the neuropsychological impairments of the two groups, eg, all subjects with stroke in the left hemisphere had more severe language defects than did their counterparts with tumors, and some tumor subjects performed normally on all neuropsychological tests. These findings demonstrate that the cognitive and/or behavioral consequences of tumors or strokes in similar locations can be radically different. The two patient types should be treated separately for the purpose of neuropsychological research.\r"

The group comprised 9 patients with generalized and 15 with segmental forms, 19 with torticollis, and 14 with focal arm dystonia. None had blepharospasm. The duration and amplitude of the R2 component of the blink reflex showed only minor changes. However, its recovery cycle to paired supraorbital nerve stimuli was abnormal in all groups of patients, except those with focal arm dystonia. These findings may be interpreted as showing abnormal control of the interneuronal networks mediating the blink reflex in patients with dystonia affecting sites other than the facial muscles. The fact that the principal changes were seen in patients with torticollis, and generalized or segmental dystonia, suggests that the extent of dystonia (rather than the severity) and, therefore, the close proximity to the cranial muscles was important in determining the extent of the abnormal interneuron function.\r"

  ".W": "Matching patients with etiologically distinct but clinically overlapping cognitive disorders on performance of a regionally specific neuropsychological task is a novel and potentially powerful approach to highlighting differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms of impaired cognition. We used this strategy to compare patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and schizophrenia (SC), disorders that share similarities in cognitive impairment. Patients were matched on the basis of performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting test of \"prefrontal\" function, after which neuropsychological test data and regional cerebral blood flow data were determined while patients who performed the Wisconsin Card Sorting test were examined. Patients with HD performed worse on visuospatial tasks and recall memory than did patients with SC, although Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales-Revised IQ and Wechsler Memory Scale memory quotients were equivalent. These differences could not be attributed to differences on the index task, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Patients with HD and SC exhibited a double dissociation in regional cerebral blood flow. The patients with SC had relatively low frontal and high parietal flows, while patients with HD exhibited the reverse of this pattern. Thus, the regional cerebral blood flow and neuropsychological findings in this study appeared to demonstrate that the single final common cognitive impairment of executive function in HD and SC is associated with two markedly dissimilar pathophysiological states.\r"

Computed tomographic scans and language behavior were examined in 14 right-handed globally aphasic stroke patients with lesion in the left hemisphere. Nine patients had large cortical/subcortical frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe lesion that included more than half of Wernicke's cortical area (FPT cases). Five patients had large cortical/subcortical frontal and parietal lobe lesion, but only subcortical temporal lobe lesion, including the temporal isthmus (FPTi cases). All patients were tested acutely at 1 to 4 months post onset and again at 1 to 2 years post onset. There was a significantly greater increase in the amount of recovery that had taken place after 1 to 2 years post onset for the FPTi group vs the FPT group in the overall Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) Auditory Comprehension Z score. In four of the five FPTi cases, the late BDAE Auditory Comprehension Z scores were above -0.5 (mild-to-moderate comprehension deficits). Most recovery was in single-word comprehension. In eight of the nine FPT cases, the late BDAE Auditory Comprehension Z-scores were below -0.5 (moderate-to-severe comprehension deficits). There was no significant difference between the two groups in recovery of spontaneous speech, repetition, or naming, where severe deficits remained in most cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The HIV-positive men were asymptomatic except for lymphadenopathy or T4 counts less than 700. The cognitive battery measured language, memory, visuospatial, information processing speeds, reasoning, attention, and psychomotor processes. The HIV-positive group was significantly slower in processing information and performed significantly less well than the HIV-negative group on certain verbal memory measures. Deviations of 1 as well as 2 SDs from the norm/control group mean on four or more tests were observed in 43% and 22% of the HIV-positive subjects, respectively, compared with 8% and none of the HIV-negative subjects, respectively. The results suggest that cognitive inefficiency occurs in a subsample of individuals during early HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "A 52-year-old human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive bisexual black man was evaluated at UCLA because of the recent onset of progressive lower-extremity weakness. Initial neurologic examination showed that the patient's distal weakness was greater than his proximal weakness, with bilateral foot drop and electrophysiologic evidence of denervation in the distal lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord disclosed no abnormalities. Subsequent neurologic evaluation 8 months later showed a myelopathy, with progression of lower-extremity weakness, spasticity, and flexor spasms, and urinary incontinence, as well as the peripheral neuropathy noted previously. A second magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed patchy foci of increased signal intensity in white matter and cortex, with mild generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy and no lesions in the spinal cord. Specimens of the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid contained antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Additionally, specimens of his serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested for antibody to human T-cell leukemia virus type I by Western blotting and radioimmunoprecipitation, and found to be positive for human T-cell leukemia virus type I gag, env, and tax antibodies. The primary cause of severe myelopathy in this patient may be infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type I rather than with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in improvement of the lower-extremity weakness, reduction in flexor spasms, and slower but significant improvement in urinary symptoms. Patients who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and have unusual motor findings should be tested for concomitant human T-cell leukemia virus type I infection.\r"

Intraocular pressure was not significantly different comparing baseline and vehicle-treated days. Significant intraocular pressure reductions occurred from 1 to 8 hours after the first dose, and lasted for at least 16 hours after the second dose. The reduction in intraocular pressure became more pronounced from day 1 to day 5 at each time interval. The mean (+/- SEM) maximum reduction in intraocular pressure was 7.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg on day 1 and 10.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg on day 5 at 3 hours after administration, comparing the intraocular pressure in drug-treated and vehicle-treated eyes. L-671,152 has a longer duration of action than does previously studied MK-927 in glaucomatous monkeys. It appears to have great clinical potential.\r"

Three independent study sites were used. The allergen challenge model of acute allergic conjunctivitis was selected to assess the agent as it provided a standardized and precise way to measure drug effectiveness for this indication. In a double-masked randomized fashion, the subjects were assigned to one of three groups that received one drop of Vasocon-A in one eye and one drop of either 0.05% naphazoline (group 1), 0.5% antazoline (group 2), or placebo (group 3) in the contralateral eye. After 10 minutes, the dose of allergen shown to elicit a 2+ redness and itching reaction was instilled bilaterally. Signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis were evaluated after 3, 5, and 10 minutes. Subjects were then rechallenged 2 hours after drug administration to assess the duration of action of the agents. Vasocon-A was found to significantly inhibit all five major signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis: itching, redness, chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing, for more than 85% of the comparisons when compared over time with placebo, naphazoline alone, or antazoline alone. The results of this study indicate that the combination of naphazoline and antazoline was more effective in inhibiting redness than naphazoline and more effective in inhibiting itching than antazoline. These findings support the use of such a combination for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.\r"

After they underwent initial indirect ophthalmoscopy, we followed up 34 individuals at 50% genetic risk for familial adenomatous polyposis with extracolonic manifestations due to an affected parent. All 34 obtained their first colorectal endoscopic examination during a follow-up period of up to 4 years. The 16 individuals who did not have congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (aged 13 to 40 years; mean, 25 years) remained polyp free, while 14 of 18 individuals with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (aged 9 to 30 years; mean, 18 years) were found to have colorectal adenomatous polyposis. Our findings indicate that the presence of multiple patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium in children and young adults at risk for familial adenomatous polyposis with extracolonic manifestations is a clinically useful predictor of colorectal polyposis.\r"

They may be accompanied by severe visual loss and may antedate the appearance of multiple melanocytic tumors, retinal detachment, and cataract in these patients with occult systemic carcinomas. These hyperfluorescent patches are caused by focal damage to the pigment epithelium overlying an intact choriocapillaris and diffuse benign nonpigmented uveal melanocytic infiltration of the outer choroid. We suggest that outer retinal damage may not be primarily caused by melanocytic proliferation, but rather by toxic and immune factors generated by interaction between a systemic carcinoma and congenital melanocytosis of the uveal tract. We report the longest survivor of this disorder to date (102 months).\r"

Keratoconus was diagnosed after a mean of 12.2 years of contact lens wear. This group was compared with patients with sporadic keratoconus with either no history of contact lens wear or a history of contact lens wear after the diagnosis. They were older at the time of diagnosis, had central vs decentered cones, and had a tendency toward flatter corneal curvatures. We believe that these patients suggest that long-term contact lens wear is a factor that can lead to keratoconus.\r"

(For the two keratoscopes, average powers around rings at comparable locations were used.) Comparisons made between instruments at the significance level of .05 indicated that the keratometer was more reproducible than the Corneal Modeling System and the Corneascope, and the Corneal Modeling System was more reproducible than the Corneascope. Of the 31 rings projected on the surface of each cornea by the Corneal Modeling System, rings 2 through 13 were read reasonably reproducibly in that 76% of the measurements on these rings differed by no more than 0.5 diopter. The Corneal Modeling System (software version 1.16) is 83% as reproducible as a keratometer reading at approximately the edge of the 3-mm central zone on normal human corneas and provides information about corneal topography in a more reproducible and visually useful manner than the other two instruments.\r"

Disc hemorrhage prevalence in glaucomatous eyes was significantly higher than in normal or glaucoma suspect eyes. Glaucoma suspect eyes with disc hemorrhage, compared with matched suspect eyes without disc hemorrhage, had a larger mean vertical cup-disc ratio, an increased rate of nerve fiber layer atrophy 1 year following disc hemorrhage, and a higher rate of conversion to initial visual field loss (numerically higher conversion though not statistically significant). While the number of eyes with disc hemorrhages in this study is small, in a patient with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, disc hemorrhage appears to be associated with a greater likelihood of ongoing damage. The low disc hemorrhage prevalence in an unselected population limits its usefulness as a screening tool for glaucoma.\r"

For these studies, two fixed monkey eyes were incised and placed on a pedestal in a plastic viewing dish. The eyes were perfused to maintain a pressure between 10 and 20 mm Hg. An ellipsometer, an optical device used to measure the change in polarization of light (retardation), was implemented in a laser tomographic scanner to obtain polarization data from the two monkey retinas. For the 15 measured locations, retardation ranged between a mean (+/- SD) of 0.9 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees and 23.7 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees. Subsequently, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was measured at the imaged points in epoxy resin-embedded sections by an observer masked to the ellipsometry data. These values ranged between 20.4 microns and 213.9 microns. There was an excellent correlation (R = .83) between retardation and the histopathologic measurement of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Quantitating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness may enhance discrimination between glaucomatous and normal eyes earlier than is currently available by anatomic and functional approaches.\r"

The disorder responds well to systemic tetracycline therapy but may involute spontaneously during a period of months to years. The distinction of this disorder from other dermal granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis, and foreign bodies, is important because of the different therapeutic implications.\r"

Even in these cases, however, no radioactivity is observed within the vitreous. After local application of 2% cyclosporine A eye drops in olive oil, a high concentration of the drug is found in the cornea and conjunctiva only. No intraocular penetration is observed in these cases. However, when cyclosporine A eye drops in absolute alcohol are used, high levels of the drug are also found in intraocular tissues. Thus, in the intact eye, the cornea and conjunctiva on the one hand and the blood retinal barrier on the other hand prevent the intraocular penetration of cyclosporine A.\r"

Immediately following rose bengal injection, 3 minutes of continuous irradiation at 20.4 W/cm2 (500-microns spot, 40 mW) applied in three to four circumferential revolutions around the base of tumor nodules, without direct tumor irradiation, produced peripheral vascular occlusion and consequent tumor inhibition. Similar therapy at higher laser intensity (30.6 W/cm2) and with multiple retreatment sessions (28.0 to 30.6 W/cm2) resulted in increased tumor-inhibiting effect. Low-dose rose bengal phototherapy did not appear to directly damage ocular tissues adjacent to treatment areas; however, when multiple irradiation sessions were given within a short interval, an increased incidence of retinal detachment was observed.\r"

We conducted a population-based study of eye injuries requiring hospital admission for children younger than 16 years in the state of Maryland during the 1982 calendar year. The population-based estimate of the incidence of ocular trauma in Maryland children was 15.2 per 100,000 per year (95% confidence interval, 12.8 to 17.7). Male patients outnumbered female patients as victims of eye injuries by a ratio of approximately 4:1; eye injuries in 11- to 15-year-old children occurred at more than twice the rate than for younger children. The most common cause of pediatric ocular trauma was accidental blows and falls (37%). Sports and recreational activities accounted for 27% of all eye injuries, 39% of all nonpenetrating injuries, and 40% of all injuries in 11- to 15-year-old children. A comparison of the causes of eye injuries at statewide specialty trauma centers and community-based hospitals indicated that sports-related injuries were treated at general hospitals more than 10 times more frequently than at the trauma centers. Other important causes of eye injuries were burns (9%), car crashes (11%), and nonpowder firearm accidents (4%). We conclude that the majority of pediatric eye injuries are preventable, and that the implementation of well-established safety precautions would greatly reduce this source of visual disability in our nation's children.\r"

ESR was a better guide to disease severity than measurement of plasma viscosity, serum C-reactive protein, and serum orosomucoid--tests that reflect the blood concentration of acute-phase proteins only. Clinical tests performed poorly unless combined with laboratory data in a numerical index.

  ".W": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was purified from media conditioned by bovine pituitary folliculostellate cells (FC). VEGF is a heparin-binding growth factor specific for vascular endothelial cells that is able to induce angiogenesis in vivo. Complementary DNA clones for bovine and human VEGF were isolated from cDNA libraries prepared from FC and HL60 leukemia cells, respectively. These cDNAs encode hydrophilic proteins with sequences related to those of the A and B chains of platelet-derived growth factor. DNA sequencing suggests the existence of several molecular species of VEGF. VEGFs are secreted proteins, in contrast to other endothelial cell mitogens such as acidic or basic fibroblast growth factors and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor. Human 293 cells transfected with an expression vector containing a bovine or human VEGF cDNA insert secrete an endothelial cell mitogen that behaves like native VEGF.\r"
