  ".W": "The maximal exercise capacity of cardiac transplant recipients is reduced compared with that of normal subjects. To determine if this reduced exercise capacity is related to inadequate myocardial perfusion during exercise, myocardial perfusion was measured noninvasively with use of positron emission tomography and nitrogen (N)-13 ammonia. Twelve transplant recipients with no angiographic evidence of accelerated coronary atherosclerosis were studied. Serial N-13 ammonia imaging was performed at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. The results were compared with those from 10 normal volunteers with a low probability of having cardiac disease. A two-compartment kinetic model for estimating myocardial perfusion was applied to the data. Transplant recipients achieved a significant lower exercise work load than did the volunteers (42 +/- 16 vs. 128 +/- 22 W), but a higher venous lactate concentration (31.3 +/- 14.9 vs. 13.7 +/- 4.1 mg/100 ml). Despite the difference in exercise work load, there was no significant difference in the cardiac work achieved by transplant recipients and normal subjects as evidenced by similar rate-pressure products of 24,000 +/- 3,400 versus 21,300 +/- 2,800 betas/min per mm Hg, respectively. In addition, myocardial blood flow during exercise was not significantly different between the two groups (1.70 +/- 0.60 vs. 1.56 +/- 0.71 ml/min per g, respectively). This study demonstrates that the myocardial flow response to the physiologic stress of exercise is appropriate in transplant recipients and does not appear to explain the decreased exercise capacity in these patients.\r"

Flow patterns in response to mitral regurgitation have not been well studied, but flows may vary enough to differentiate among different grades of regurgitation. Accordingly, pulmonary venous flow velocities were recorded in 50 consecutive patients referred for outpatient (n = 26) or intraoperative (mitral valve repair; n = 24) echocardiographic examination for mitral regurgitation. Recordings were made of right and left upper pulmonary veins with pulsed wave Doppler transesophageal echocardiography. Mitral regurgitation was graded from 1+ to 4+ by an independent observer using transesophageal color flow mapping. The results of cardiac catheterization performed 5 weeks earlier in 43 of the patients were also graded for mitral regurgitation by an independent observer. Pulmonary venous flow patterns, the presence of reversed systolic flow and peak systolic and diastolic flow velocities were compared with the severity of mitral regurgitation indicated by each technique. Of the 28 patients with 4+ regurgitation by transesophageal color flow mapping, 26 (93%) had reversed systolic flow. The sensitivity of reversed systolic flow in detecting 4+ mitral regurgitation by transesophageal color flow mapping was 93% and the specificity was 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of reversed systolic flow in detecting 4+ mitral regurgitation by cardiac catheterization were 86% and 81%, respectively. Discordant flows were observed in 9 (24%) of 38 patients; the left vein usually showed blunted systolic flow and the right showed reversed systolic flow. In 22 intraoperative patients, there was \"normalization\" of pulmonary venous systolic flow after mitral valve repair in the postcardiopulmonary bypass study compared with the prebypass study after the mitral regurgitant leak was corrected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the accuracy of localization, 345 patients undergoing operative ablation were studied; 316 (91.6%) had a single accessory pathway and 29 (8.4%) had multiple accessory pathways. The electrophysiologic study was diagnostically complete and accurate in 294 patients (93%) with a single accessory pathway and 19 (61%) with multiple accessory pathways. A left lateral accessory pathway was most accurately localized with excellent sensitivity (99%) and positive predictive value (98.5%). Diagnostic errors occurred in 33 patients because of 1) incorrect localization (n = 16), 2) failure to detect a second pathway (n = 9), and 3) diagnosis of a second pathway not verified intraoperatively (n = 8). Multiple pathways were more prevalent in the group with errors (33.3% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.0001), as were unidirectional pathways (48.5% vs. 24.3%, p = 0.003). It is concluded that preoperative localization of accessory pathways is sufficiently accurate to allow intraoperative mapping to be brief and focused.\r"

These normal data were compared with data in three groups of fetuses with altered ductal flow velocities: 22 fetuses (mean gestational age 31.3 weeks) had ductal constriction due to maternal indomethacin treatment; 10 fetuses (mean gestational age 27.9 weeks) had been exposed to terbutaline, a positive inotropic agent and 14 fetuses (mean gestational age 33.3 weeks) had hypoplastic left heart syndrome. In normal fetuses maximal systolic, mean and end-diastolic ductal flow velocities increased linearly (p less than 0.0001). The pulsatility index did not change (mean +/- 2 SD: 2.46 +/- 0.52). Fetuses with ductal constriction had higher maximal, mean and end-diastolic flow velocities and a significantly lower pulsatility index than did normal fetuses (1.25 +/- 0.76; p less than 0.0005). Six of 10 fetuses of the terbutaline group and 8 of 14 fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome had increased maximal flow velocity, but normal or only mildly elevated mean flow velocity. The pulsatility index in fetuses during terbutaline therapy and with hypoplastic left heart syndrome was significantly higher than in normal fetuses (3.11 +/- 0.46 and 3.09 +/- 0.7, respectively, vs. 2.46 +/- 0.52; p less than 0.0005). Fetal ductal waveform analysis was necessary to distinguish fetal ductal constriction from increased right ventricular output. These measurements may be helpful in the diagnosis of left-sided outflow obstruction and assessment of fetal hemodynamic data.\r"

Prebypass transesophageal echocardiography (including two-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler color flow mapping and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound) correctly diagnosed divided AV valve, common AV valve and unbalanced AV valve, as well as atrial or ventricular septal defect, or both, in all cases. It correctly analyzed AV valve regurgitation in all 10 patients with right and all 14 with left AV valve regurgitation and correctly analyzed 30 of 33 additional cardiac anomalies. Transesophageal echocardiography was able to detect the absence of normal pulmonary venous connections but failed to demonstrate all of the complex anomalous pulmonary venous connections in three patients with atrial isomerism. Postbypass transesophageal echocardiography documented the absence of a significant residual shunt in 11 of 11 patients undergoing corrective surgery and verified residual AV valve regurgitation in 7 of 9 patients with tricuspid regurgitation and 11 of 13 with mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiographic information that altered or refined the surgical treatment was obtained in 5 (31%) of 16 patients. Epicardial and transesophageal echocardiography results were concordant in all 13 patients in whom both were performed. Transesophageal echocardiography provides useful and accurate imaging of the important two-dimensional, pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound and Doppler color flow mapping features in AV septal defect.\r"

  ".W": "To date, attempted balloon dilation of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts has been largely disappointing. It has been suggested that this may be due to the use of balloons of insufficient diameter. Balloon dilation of stenotic Blalock-Taussig shunts was attempted with use of relatively large balloons in five patients (11 to 67 months old) with cyanotic heart disease who were becoming progressively cyanotic and polycythemic (hemoglobin 17.9 +/- 1.1 g/dl) because of discrete shunt stenosis at the site of pulmonary anastomosis. Balloon diameters selected were equal to or within 1 mm of the unobstructed proximal shunt diameter. Before balloon dilation the diameter at the site of the stenosis was 2.8 +/- 0.8 mm (range 1.7 to 4); after balloon dilation it was 5.7 +/- 1.1 mm (range 4.5 to 7.5). The diameter increased in all patients (range 2.0 to 3.5 mm); the mean increase was 2.8 +/- 0.2 mm (p less than 0.005). Expressed as a percent, the increase in diameter at the stenosis ranged from 80% to 182.4% (mean 108.2 +/- 16.8%). Before balloon dilation the systemic oxygen saturation was 72.8 +/- 9.2% (range 55% to 80%) and after balloon dilation it was 83.6 +/- 2.9% (range 80% to 87%). A satisfactory increase (range 6% to 25%) in blood oxygen saturation was seen in all patients; the mean increase was 10.8 +/- 3.2% (p less than 0.01). At follow-up, the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 85.8 +/- 2.9% (mean 5.8 +/- 1.7 months after balloon dilation) and the hemoglobin was 15.6 +/- 1.9 g/dl (mean 6.6 +/- 1.5 months after balloon dilation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The echocardiographic anatomy of double-inlet single left ventricle was studied in 57 patients, aged 1 day to 27 years (mean 6 years); the variables examined included morphology, size and function of the atrioventricular (AV) valves and ventricular septal defect and their relation to pulmonary stenosis, aortic stenosis and aortic arch obstruction. The visceroatrial situs was solitus and the heart was in the left side of the chest in all 57 patients. A d-loop ventricle was present in 21 patients and an l-loop ventricle in 36. The great arteries were normally related (Holmes heart) in 8 patients and transposed in 49. In all hearts, the right AV valve was anterior to the left AV valve. In 53 patients, the tricuspid valve (right valve in d-loop and left valve in l-loop) was closer to and had attachments on the septum. The tricuspid valve straddled the outflow chamber in eight patients. No significant difference was noted in the mean AV valve diameter when comparing mitral and tricuspid valves within the same group or between the groups with a d- or l-loop ventricle. The right AV valve diameter had a significant direct correlation with the aortic valve diameter and the size of the ventricular septal defect regardless of ventricular loop. Both AV valves were functionally normal in 34 patients. Among patients with AV valve dysfunction, the tricuspid valve tended to be stenotic in patients with an l-loop ventricle and regurgitant in patients with a d-loop ventricle. Mitral valve dysfunction was uncommon. The ventricular septal defect (46 patients) was separated from the semilunar valves in 24 patients (muscular defect) and adjacent to the anterior semilunar valve as a result of hypoplasia or malalignment, or both, of the infundibular septum (subaortic defect) in 19 patients. Multiple defects were present in three patients. The defect was unrestrictive in 26 patients, restrictive in 23 and could not be evaluated in 8. Pulmonary artery banding had been performed in 8 of the 26 patients with an unrestrictive defect and in 10 of the 23 patients with a restrictive defect. Only 4 of 19 subaortic defects compared with 16 of 24 muscular defects were restrictive. The size of the defect was significantly correlated with the measured pressure gradient. Among patients with transposition, only 2 of 13 with pulmonary stenosis had a restrictive ventricular septal defect compared with 15 of 30 without pulmonary stenosis. In patients with transposition, the defect size was significantly smaller when coarctation was present.\r"

Transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography combined with pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound and color flow mapping provided detailed morphologic as well as physiologic information, with additional information provided overall in 56% of the cases. Typical limitations of single-plane transverse imaging were overcome using a prototype longitudinal-axis pediatric probe. Both left and right ventricular outflow tracts, distal pulmonary arteries and all of the interventricular and atrial septa were visualized. Assessment of surgical repair intraoperatively as well as assessment postoperatively for cardiac function, residual intracardiac shunts, residual valvular sequelae and other hemodynamic events was important and easily performed in an otherwise inaccessible patient.

A long sinus or atrial pause occurring at the termination of tachycardia or cessation of atrial pacing, ranging from 3,100 to 8,200 ms (mean 6,270 +/- 1,674), was provoked by the administration of various drugs. These included an intravenous bolus injection of adenosine triphosphate (5 mg; one patient), intravenous bolus injection of verapamil (5 mg; one patient), a combination of a single oral dose of diltiazem (120 mg) and propranolol (20 to 40 mg; three patients), oral diltiazem (240 mg/day; one patient) and a combination of oral diltiazem (240 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day; one patient). In five patients, low frequency deflections suggestive of sinus node activity with a cycle length between 620 and 3,500 ms were recorded during pauses. These findings suggest that repetitive sinoatrial exit block was responsible for the pause. Sinus slowing with a long arrest suggesting suppression of sinus automaticity was also noted in three of these five patients; the longest sinus arrest in these three patients was 4,160, 4,800 and greater than 4,910 ms, respectively. The remaining patient with a pause of 6,840 ms had no recordable sinus activity, either reflecting suppression of sinus automaticity or technical failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Plasma and myocardial tissue concentrations of metoprolol were studied in ischemic and nonischemic areas of 22 pigs after 90 (n = 19) and 16 (n = 3) min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Group A (n = 6) received simultaneous intravenous metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight) and tritium-labeled (3H)-metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) retrogradely into the coronary vein. In group B (n = 5), metoprolol and 3H-metoprolol were administered in the same way, but at half the volume to study the influence of derived coronary venous pressure on the myocardial concentration of drug. In group C (n = 3), metoprolol was given retrogradely and saline solution was infused into the left anterior descending artery before induced death to wash out metoprolol from the coronary veins. To rule out a possible influence of the development of myocardial necrosis on drug distribution, metoprolol was retroinfused after 1 min of arterial occlusion in three pigs (group D). In group E (n = 5), metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) was infused anterogradely into the left anterior descending artery. Peak plasma concentration was significantly higher after intravenous infusion of metoprolol (1,188 +/- 503 nmol/liter) than after coronary venous infusion (417 +/- 155 nmol/liter; p less than 0.001). In groups A and B, the nonischemic myocardial concentration of metoprolol was 250 to 300 pmol/g, whether the drug was infused intravenously or into the coronary vein. Coronary venous retroinfusion, however, resulted in a substantial accumulation of metoprolol in the ischemic myocardium. In group A pigs, subendocardial myocardial concentration was 16,800 +/- 7,774, mid-myocardial 39,590 +/- 18,043 and subepicardial 57,143 +/- 29,030 pmol/g (mean +/- SE). The ischemic myocardial concentration in pigs from group B was somewhat less pronounced, probably secondary to a lower coronary venous pressure (15 +/- 3 mm Hg) with the lower volume of infusion (6.1 +/- 0.3 ml) in group B compared with 32 +/- 5 mm Hg with a 14 +/- 1 ml infusion in group A. Coronary artery anterograde administration resulted in myocardial ischemic and nonischemic zone drug concentrations similar to those observed after retroinfusion into the coronary vein. With both modes of administration, there was a transmyocardial gradient from a somewhat lower drug concentration in the subendocardium, toward an increasing level in the mid-myocardium, to the highest concentration in the subepicardial zone of the ischemic myocardium. Coronary venous retroinfusion resulted in pronounced drug accumulation in the ischemic myocardium. The derived coronary venous pressure during infusion influenced the concentration of drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of coronary venous retroinfusion of the iron chelator deferoxamine was studied in 24 pentobarbital-anesthetized open chest pigs with a 60 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Eight retrogradely treated pigs were given 10 mg/kg body weight of deferoxamine by way of the anterior interventricular vein and eight systemically treated pigs received the same doses of deferoxamine intravenously. Drug infusions lasted for 5 min, beginning 15 min before reperfusion. Eight control pigs received systemic intravenous saline solution. Myocardial area at risk and necrotic area were assessed by the monastral blue dye and the triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method, respectively. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics or regional myocardial function (sonomicrometry) among the groups. Infarct size expressed as percent of risk area was 73.9 +/- 13.5% in the control group, 70.6 +/- 16.4% in the systemically treated group and 48.5 +/- 21.4% (p less than 0.05) in the retrogradely treated group. In conclusion, deferoxamine significantly reduced infarct size after coronary occlusion only when given regionally by way of the coronary vein. Because there was no significant hemodynamic effect caused by deferoxamine infusion, it is suggested that this drug prevents postischemic reperfusion injury by a direct cardioprotective effect.\r"

In patients undergoing aortic valve or aortic root surgery, there is no evidence that coronary sinus cardioplegia results in a better myocardial protection than that achieved with the use of standard methods of anterograde cardioplegia delivery. However, the retrograde approach provides distinct technical advantages that might favor its use as an alternative to direct coronary ostial cannulation. In select subgroups of patients undergoing coronary bypass procedures, there is a growing body of evidence that the coronary sinus route may be more effective than the anterograde route because of its superior capacity to ensure homogeneous distribution of cooling and cardioplegia in myocardial areas supplied occluded arteries. The well established safety of coronary sinus cardioplegia in the clinical setting further justifies its inclusion among techniques for ensuring adequate myocardial preservation during surgically induced ischemic arrest.\r"

Each trainee must be eligible for board certification in Internal Medicine and either eligible for certification in Cardiovascular Diseases or in a program leading to eligibility. Training faculty should be certified in clinical cardiac electrophysiology or demonstrate equivalent credentials. At least two training faculty members are preferred. The faculty must be dedicated to teaching, active in performing or promoting research and must spend a substantial portion of their time in research, teaching and practice of clinical electrophysiology. A curriculum of training should be established. Faculty experts in the related basic sciences should be available and involved in teaching. The institution should have a fully equipped clinical electrophysiology laboratory and complete noninvasive capabilities. A close working relation with a cardiac surgery faculty member skilled in surgical treatment of arrhythmias is required. Training in application of pharmacologic and all current nonpharmacologic therapies, in the outpatient and inpatient setting, is necessary. The clinical exposure must include all facets of arrhythmia diagnosis and treatment and must be quantitatively sufficient to allow the trainee to develop proficiency. The period of training should not be less than one year in addition to the period of cardiology fellowship required by the ABIM for board eligibility. A continuous period of training is preferred.\r"

A large and sustained burden of respiratory illness was observed, and respiratory viruses were isolated in 35% of the samples collected. Of the isolates, 45.6% were rhinoviruses, 16% parainfluenza viruses, 15.8% enteroviruses, 9.9% adenoviruses, 7.0% herpes simplex viruses, and 5.7% influenza viruses. The results indicate that poor children in northeast Brazil have a high prevalence of respiratory illness and that rhinovirus is the most frequent respiratory virus.\r"

Cases and 358 randomly selected controls delivered neonates between 1980 and 1988; in this interval neonates were routinely tested for viruria. Eighty-four percent of the study population was black and greater than 87% received prenatal care. Women with gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, or bacterial vaginosis had an increased risk of intrauterine transmission of CMV, as did those who were primigravid (odds ratios, 1.8-2.5). Women who were young, unmarried, and of lower income were almost four times more likely to deliver a CMV-infected newborn than were those who did not have all three of these factors. These results in a predominantly black, low-income population indicate a greater risk for congenital CMV infection in offspring of young, single, primigravid mothers. The association with gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections suggests that sexual activity is an important source of maternal CMV infections that result in congenital infection in this population.\r"

Serum and local antibody responses were measured. The ratio of input virus strongly influenced the amount of each strain recovered from the child. Regardless of dose of virus administered, the neutralizing antibody response to the VP7 glycoprotein, the serotype determinant, was diminished in a bivalent preparation compared with a monovalent vaccine. Additional strategies must be sought to induce immunity against the multiple serotypes of human rotavirus before broad immunity will be established.\r"

The only symptomatic reinfections occurred in 2 subjects who did not develop rotavirus antibody after the initial detection of rotavirus. An age-related reduction in the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic primary rotavirus infection was also detected. In this study, protection against homotypic serotype 1 reinfection appeared to last greater than or equal to 2 years.\r"

Among 82 unrelated children, 32 HBV DNA variants were present. One sequence was present in 33 children and 31 variants were found among the other 49. Siblings within each of nine families had the same variant; in three families siblings had different variants. Six of the eight fathers and 28 of the 30 mothers had HBV DNA sequences identical to those of their offspring. A total of 34 variants were found among the 134 individuals.

Serial examinations revealed that HSV DNA remained in the serum and/or CSF from several patients for 1-2 weeks after the beginning of treatment. Next, the results of PCR assay in neonatal HSV infections were compared with those in older children with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). HSV DNA was detected in CSF from four neonates with central nervous system involvement and in CSF from all nine children with HSE. Sera were positive for HSV DNA in five of seven neonates, including two cases of localized infections, but in none of the children with HSE. These results suggest that HSV may be spread principally via viremia in neonates. PCR assay could be useful for the confirmative diagnosis of neonatal HSV infections, especially in culture-negative cases.\r"

Hemorrhage may accompany either. Epidemiologic data suggest a role for dengue antibodies in pathogenesis. Computer analysis revealed a 20-residue region of similarity in amino acid sequence between the dengue type 4 envelope glycoprotein (E) and a family of clotting factors, including plasminogen, the prime mediator of fibrinolysis. By use of synthetic peptides in ELISA, E antibodies that potentially bind plasminogen were detected in 75% of 40 Thai patients acutely infected with dengue virus type 1, 2, 3, or 4. Plasminogen cross-reactivity of dengue antibodies was shown to be specific for the related sites in E and plasminogen. The dengue E sequence with similarity to plasminogen is largely conserved within the currently known flavivirus E sequences. However, 15 Thai patients hospitalized for illness caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (a flavivirus not associated with hemorrhage) did not develop plasminogen-cross-reactive antibodies, and this finding correlated with failure of Japanese encephalitis virus antibodies to bind to the plasminogen-cross-reactive site in E.\r"

Seven patterns of antibody reactivity could be defined; all but one were distinct from those found recently in resistant strains. In addition, electrophoretic mobilities of all six PBPs, compared after conventional SDS-PAGE and fluorography, revealed an unexpected variation of PBP-profiles even for strains of one sero-group. Few strains appeared identical to each other or to the laboratory reference strain R6.\r"

The relatedness of PBPs from 55 resistant strains isolated on three continents was investigated by testing the reactivity of antibodies specific for PBP 1a or 2b and by comparing the PBP patterns. Seventeen patterns of antibody reactivity could be distinguished, 12 of which were specific to one isolate. Most strains, including all German and South African strains, had a unique PBP profile. A few groups of Spanish and Finnish isolates were identified where the strains within each group shared the same PBP profile, the same antigenic variants of PBPs 1a and 2b, and the same serogroup, suggesting that they represent different clones of S. pneumoniae. The results demonstrated highly variable pathways of resistance development and confirmed that resistant strains have emerged independently in different locations.\r"

Three infants did not receive antibiotics and died of GBS sepsis by 10 h of age despite mechanical ventilation and fluids for blood pressure support. Penicillin treatment of the fourth infant prolonged survival and decreased the requirement for supportive therapy. Quantitative cultures and histopathology were done on all four infants. Transmission electron microscopy of lung tissue demonstrated GBS within membrane-bound vacuoles of type I and II alveolar epithelium and interstitial fibroblasts. This model should be useful for studying the early steps in the pathogenesis of early-onset GBS infections. GBS may enter alveolar epithelial cells to transit this barrier and ultimately disseminate via the blood-stream.\r"

Isolation of EAF+ classic EPEC decreased with increasing age of cases and peaked in spring, whereas rotavirus was least common in early infancy and peaked in fall and winter. Bloody stool had a 36% positive predictive value for Shigella infection, EAF+ classic EPEC were highly resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among poor Sao Paulo infants, EAF+ classic EPEC equaled or exceeded rotavirus throughout the year as a cause of diarrhea bringing children to medical attention.\r"

E. coli were cultured from frozen patties that were manufactured at the same plant on the same dates as the implicated patties, but serotype O157:H7 was not isolated.

It has been hypothesized that circulating Shiga toxin, Shiga-like toxins, and endotoxins may contribute to the disease by directly damaging glomerular endothelial cells. The effects of these toxins on HeLa, Vero, and human vascular endothelial cells (EC) were examined. Confluent EC were sensitive to Shiga toxin but were at least 10(6)-fold less sensitive to the toxins than were Vero cells. Shiga toxin was the predominant cytotoxic factor. Lipopolysaccharides were not cytotoxic and did not augment Shiga toxin-mediated toxicity. Lower doses of Shiga toxin caused cytotoxicity when coincubated with tumor necrosis factor. The relative resistance of EC to Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxins may be due to reduced toxin binding, as low levels of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the toxin-specific receptor, were found in EC membranes.\r"

This immunolimulus (IML) assay combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the sensitivity of the LAL system to achieve the first specific, sensitive quantitation of bioactive endotoxin in plasma. In the animal model tested, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteremia in infant rats, there was a strong correlation between IML results and the concentration of Hib colony-forming units in blood samples (r = .845, P less than .001). Using antibodies with appropriate specificities, this approach should be useful for rapid detection of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria and endotoxins in blood.\r"

Lesion production in this new model was dependent on both viability of the H. ducreyi inoculum and replication of these organisms after intradermal injection. Histopathologic examination of the lesions revealed that H. ducreyi infection of the rabbit dermis evolves from an acute inflammatory reaction to abscess formation. Evaluation of three additional strains of H. ducreyi in this model confirmed that lesion formation was not bacterial strain-dependent. This new temperature-dependent rabbit model for productive H. ducreyi infection will facilitate investigation of the molecular pathogenesis of chancroid.\r"

By defining confirmation of infection as the presence of antibodies to p24 gag protein and to p21E, all 56 HTLV-I and 49 HTLV-II antisera were confirmed by this modified Western blot alone. Differentiation was determined by reactivity to MTA-4. All HTLV-I antisera reacted with MTA-4 and all HTLV-II antisera did not react with MTA-4. These findings indicate the utility of selected HTLV-I recombinant proteins in a single assay format to confirm and differentiate infections with HTLV-I and HTLV-II.\r"

Tamm-Horsfall protein, a major urinary glycoprotein, has also been shown to bind mannose-sensitive E. coli via mannose-containing side chains. The effect of Tamm-Horsfall protein on the interaction between PMNL and mannose-sensitive E. coli was studied by measuring luminol-dependent chemoluminescence after bacterial stimulation. In the presence of 0.475, 4.75, 47.5, and 475 mg/l Tamm-Horsfall protein, chemoluminescence responses were reduced in a dose-dependent fashion by 8.7%, 38.1%, 60.3%, and 96.1%, respectively. Addition of 0.003 units/ml alpha-mannosidase reversed the effect of increasing concentrations significantly. Thus, urinary Tamm-Horsfall protein seems to compete with PMNL for mannose-sensitive E. coli in a mannose-sensitive fashion, thereby significantly reducing the role of PMNL as a defense mechanism in the urine of patients with urinary tract infection.\r"

Before vaccines were given, antitoxin titers were highest in children, especially those with O blood group, whereas vibriocidal titers rose throughout life. Two weeks after three doses of vaccine, geometric mean antitoxin titers were 2.5-4.5 times higher in vaccinees who received the WC/BS vaccine; the vibriocidal titers were 1.3-2.1 times higher in vaccinees who received either vaccine. The titer elevations were relatively brief and were barely detectable 7 months after the third dose even though significant levels of protection persisted greater than or equal to 3 years. Thus, the oral vaccines induced a serum response in this large field trial that was similar to that seen in earlier pilot studies, but the duration of the serum responses was much shorter than the duration of the protection.\r"

Three other patients had evidence of acute disease by published criteria for antibody titers. Most studies of C. pneumonia have not had culture-proven cases; the 6% rate of positive cultures in this study support the role of C. pneumoniae as a cause of pneumonia.

This study evaluated the role of the quantitative culture of BAL in the diagnosis of lung abscess. Four episodes of lung abscess in three patients were studied, and the results of quantitative culture of BAL were compared with those of the standard technique of TTA. Nineteen anaerobic bacterial species were recovered from the BAL fluid, all but one at concentrations greater than 10(3) cfu/ml. Culture of BAL fluid yielded 18 of 22 of the isolates cultured from TTA, including 12 of 16 of the anaerobic bacteria.

Before treatment, the NIDDM group had a somewhat higher plasma triglyceride level (154 +/- 58.3 mg/dl, vs control, 80.0 +/- 21 mg/dl [mean +/- SD]; p less than 0.025) than controls but their cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels did not differ from control levels. A number of significant disturbances, however, were present in the surface and core lipid composition of their lipoproteins. Although the cholesterol content of NIDDM low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was similar to that of controls, its content of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylinositol plus phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin-to-lecithin ratio all were significantly reduced. Moreover, their very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and HDL2 tended to have reduced amounts of free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) relative to lecithin, and their HDL2 and HDL3 tended to be triglyceride enriched. Probucol therapy resulted in significant decreases in total plasma cholesterol (-15%), FC (-28%), HDL-C (-22%), and triglyceride (-16%) and in apoproteins A-I, B, and E (apo A-I, B, and E), without changing diabetic control (before probucol: hemoglobin A1, cholesterol, 10.7% +/- 2.7%; after probucol: 10.9% +/- 3.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although hemodynamic factors such as glomerular hypertension are felt to be important in the progression of renal disease, the effects of dietary PUFA supplementation on glomerular hemodynamics are unknown. The present investigation, therefore, was designed to evaluate the glomerular hemodynamic effects of dietary PUFA supplementation in normal rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed standard chow supplemented with either 20% (wt/wt) fish oil (FO) as a source of omega-3 PUFAs, 20% sunflower oil (SO) as a source of omega-6 PUFAs, or 20% coconut oil (CO) as a control diet. Micropuncture studies were performed after 4 to 6 weeks of dietary supplementation. Compared with CO rats, SO rats did not demonstrate any changes in glomerular hemodynamics. However, rats supplemented with FO demonstrated significant (p less than 0.05) increases in both single nephron glomerular filtration rate and single nephron plasma flow. These hemodynamic changes were not associated with alterations in glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure or the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. The increase in SNPF was primarily the consequence of a 37% reduction (p less than 0.05) in efferent arteriolar resistance. Thus dietary FO supplementation resulted in glomerular hyperfiltration and hyperperfusion. These hemodynamic actions may have important consequences in determining the effect of omega-3 PUFAs on the course of experimental and clinical renal disease.\r"

  ".W": "Dipyridamole is an antithrombotic drug that has been shown to influence not only platelet function but also some aspects of leukocyte activation. In this study we demonstrate that dipyridamole effectively inhibits superoxide anion generation by neutrophils, mononuclear leukocytes, and whole blood stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl phenylalanine and calcium ionophore A23187. In addition, the drug, at concentrations as low as 1 mumol/L, inhibits the expression of procoagulant activity--basal and stimulated--by mononuclear leukocytes. It is shown that, similar to its effect on platelets, dipyridamole influences these leukocyte functions indirectly, that is, through an increase of extracellular adenosine that in turn inhibits both superoxide anion generation by leukocytes and the expression of procoagulant activity by mononuclear leukocytes. In fact, adenosine deaminase, which metabolizes adenosine to inactive product, prevents the effects of dipyridamole on superoxide anion generation and on the expression of procoagulant activity by leukocytes. Experiments carried out with 8-phenyl-theophylline indicate that the adenosine-dependent effects of dipyridamole may involve multiple pathways, only some of which are dependent on the interaction of adenosine with its receptors. Dipyridamole also dose-dependently inhibits the synthesis of leukotrienes B4 and C4 by stimulated neutrophils and mononuclear leukocytes through a mechanism that is not mediated by the presence of adenosine in the extracellular medium. The reported effects of dipyridamole on separate and distinct pathways involved in leukocyte activation are of relevance in the overall evaluation of the antithrombotic activity of this drug.\r"

  ".W": "Mature erythrocytes, when removed from the circulation, exhibit severe disturbances of glycolytic flow, with accumulation not only of lactate, the ultimate product of glycolysis, but also of several upstream metabolic intermediates, primarily fructose-1,6-diphosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This accumulation may be prevented (and also reverted) by allowing the diffusible end products lactate and pyruvate to leave the cell by equilibrating with a much larger extracellular compartment. The disturbance of erythrocyte glycolysis does not result from direct inhibition by lactate itself but from the interplay between the lactate dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (3-PGAD) reactions. The accumulation of intermediates reflects the increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio; this leads to a secondary imbalance of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-to-reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD-to-NADH) ratio, which in turn slows down glycolysis at the 3-PGAD step, whose upstream metabolites then pile up. No accumulation, however, takes place if the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio is maintained constant in the extracellular compartment, regardless of concentrations. These studies demonstrate that orderly glycolysis in the erythrocyte is regulated by the NAD-to-NADH ratio and also provide a method that makes possible the in vitro study of erythrocyte glycolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Retention of beta 2-microglobulin in patients undergoing hemodialysis is associated with a beta 2-microglobulin-derived amyloidosis. Removal of beta 2-microglobulin by renal replacement therapy has been proposed for the prevention of this amyloidosis. Currently, however, data on the beta 2-microglobulin synthesis rate in patients undergoing hemodialysis are scarce, and consequently it remains speculative how much removal would be necessary to counterbalance synthesis. The plasma kinetics of iodine 131-labeled beta 2-microglobulin were therefore examined in 11 patients with anuria who were undergoing long-term hemodialysis. Five healthy persons served as controls. Kinetic modeling of the plasma curves showed that the data fitted a two-pool model (r2 greater than 0.96) consisting of a rapid 2 to 4 hour distribution phase followed by a less steep curve, described by the plasma (metabolic) clearance (Clp). Synthetic rates were calculated from Clp and the beta 2-microglobulin steady state plasma concentration (plus beta 2-microglobulin removal during hemodialysis in the case of high flux hemodialysis). The results showed a significantly higher Clp in normal controls as compared with patients undergoing hemodialysis (65.5 +/- 12.8 ml/min (mean +/- SD) versus 3.4 +/- 0.7 ml/min). In contrast, the beta 2-microglobulin synthesis rate in the patient group (3.10 +/- 0.79 mg/kg/day) was not significantly different from that of normal controls (2.40 +/- 0.67 mg/kg/day), which was due to markedly elevated beta 2-microglobulin plasma concentrations in the patients (37.6 +/- 14.1 mg/L vs 1.92 +/- 0.27 mg/L). These findings suggest that the presence of end-stage renal disease does not have a significant impact on the beta 2-microglobulin generation rate. The degree of accumulation of beta 2-microglobulin in patients undergoing hemodialysis seems to depend on the loss of renal excretory function.\r"

Although the mechanism of this effect is not known, the renal responses to these loads have been associated with increases in peripheral glucagon concentrations. Conflicting data exist concerning the role of glucagon in the hyperfiltration response after an oral protein meal or administration of an intravenous amino acid mixture. Using a single amino acid as the stimulus for hyperfiltration, we compared the renal responses in six normal subjects to 30 gm oral arginine-HCl, intravenous arginine-HCl, and intravenous glucagon infused at the rate of 10 ng/kg/min. GFR, RPF, and glucagon concentration, as well as levels of plasma amino acids and selected gastrointestinal hormones, were measured for six 30-minute clearance periods after each load. Significant rises in mean peak GFR were noted after both oral arginine (104 +/- 5 ml/min x 1.73 m2 to 145 +/- 9 ml/min x 1.73 m2, p less than 0.02) and intravenous arginine (118 +/- 10 ml/min x 1.73 m2 to 134 +/- 11 ml/min x 1.73 m2, p = 0.02) administration. Mean peak RPF rose significantly after oral arginine (510 +/- 26 ml/min x 1.73 m2 to 710 +/- 32 ml/min x 1.73 m2, p less than 0.01) but not after intravenous arginine (616 +/- 60 ml/min x 1.73 m2 to 687 +/- 64 ml/min x 1.73 m2, p = 0.18). Intravenous glucagon infusion also increased both mean peak GFR (99 +/- 9 ml/min x 1.73 m2 to 149 +/- 10 ml/min x 1.73 m2, p less than 0.01) and RPF (514 +/- 48 ml/min x 1.73 m2 to 771 +/- 38 ml/min x 1.73 m2, p less than 0.01) significantly. We found the mean peak percent rise in GFR (43% +/- 13%) and RPF (42% +/- 12%) after oral arginine to be notably greater than that after intravenous arginine (14% +/- 5% and 13% +/- 9%, respectively). However, the mean peak percent rise in glucagon concentration after oral arginine was significantly lower than that after intravenous arginine (62% +/- 25% versus 479% +/- 176%, respectively, p = 0.04). Infusion of glucagon increased GFR (54% +/- 13%) and RPF (55% +/- 12%) to a degree similar to that seen after oral arginine, but again with a significantly higher mean peak percent rise in peripheral glucagon concentrations when compared with the rise after oral arginine (798% +/- 348% vs 62% +/- 25%, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We investigated 59 patients with LC of different etiology on admission to hospital and compared them with 32 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Nutritional (cutaneous skinfolds, creatinine-height index) and serum parameters were determined; of these, alpha- and beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lycopene, retinol and alpha-tocopherol were detected by an high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique, devised in our laboratory, which afforded an accurate and simultaneous resolution of all six compounds. The results point to a significant reduction in almost all the vitamin factors in LC, as well as in total serum lipids. In consequence, the ratio tocopherol/total serum lipids remains almost unchanged: 2.45 +/- 0.08 (m +/- se) in controls and 2.34 +/- 0.16 in patients. The effects of age, sex, nutritional habits, alcohol, malnutrition and the severity of the disease were also evaluated in relation to the vitamin-factor levels. It is suggested that the reduced levels observed in LC patients are due to a number of factors including portal hypertension and lymphatic circulation impairment, and it is concluded that thorough screening and improved diet are beneficial in the follow-up of LC.\r"

This study was designed to examine the capacity of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to mask their endotoxin content in vitro as measured by a chromogenic modification of the standard Limulus assay. Lipoproteins and lipoprotein-deficient plasma were isolated from normal human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation under apyrogenic conditions. Individual lipoproteins and a synthetic lipid emulsion were suspended in 10% lipoprotein-deficient plasma. Samples were then incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 hours with increasing concentrations of E. coli (055:B5) endotoxin and assayed for detectable endotoxin activity. The capacity to inhibit detection of endotoxin in 10% lipoprotein-deficient plasma was significantly increased (10 to 100 times) by the addition of VLDL (1.0 mg triglyceride/ml), chylomicrons (1.0 mg triglyceride/ml), or the synthetic lipid emulsion (2.5 mg triglycerides/ml). These data demonstrate that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and the synthetic lipid emulsion, can markedly inhibit the detection of endotoxin by the Limulus assay in vitro. In addition to the potential of harm to experimental subjects, infusion of endotoxin could vitiate kinetic studies by direct alteration of lipoprotein metabolism and by inducing changes in hepatic blood flow. Thus experimental protocols that involve the infusion of humans with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins should include detailed testing for the presence of endotoxin.\r"

  ".W": "A combination absorption-elution, two-dimensional absorption-inhibition procedure was used to determine the ABH antigen composition of a series of human bone specimens of known ABO type that had been aged up to nine months under dry and humid conditions at ambient temperature, 37 degrees C, and 56 degrees C; at ambient temperature in dry and wet soil; and buried in soil outdoors. Grouping data for the separate elution and inhibition testing, as well as for the combination procedure, are given. The combination method was found to be a highly reliable procedure for bone tissue ABH typing. Some data on microbial contaminants of human bone specimens aging in soil, and their effects on ABH typing results, are presented. No direct correlation between the properties of microbial contaminants and specific changes in the ABH antigenic composition of aging bone tissue specimens could be ascertained. Data on IGH antigen determination and on the quantitation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in human bone tissue extracts indicated that immunoglobulin levels were typically too low to expect routinely successful Gm antigen testing results. However, these factors can sometimes be determined in fresh bone tissue extracts, particularly if the extracts are concentrated.\r"

Thus, the capability of performing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis on evidentiary samples could be compromised. In order to investigate the potential effects of presumptive test reagents on the DNA present in these samples, bloodstains on cotton and glass were exposed directly to luminol, benzidine, phenolphthalein, o-tolidine, and leucomalachite green, while semen stains and vaginal swabs containing semen were exposed directly to bromochloroindolyl phosphate (BCIP) and sodium thymolphthalein monophosphate (STMP) reagents. The yield gels for DNA quality and quantity and RFLP results indicated that bloodstains exposed to luminol, benzidine dissolved in ethanol, and phenolphthalein, as well as semen stains and vaginal swabs exposed to BCIP and STMP yield RFLP patterns consistent with that of the uncontaminated control. Except for the phenolphthalein treatment, the quantity of extractable, high-molecular-weight DNA obtained was comparable with that of untreated stains. Therefore, evidentiary material purposely or inadvertently contaminated with these reagents can be successfully typed. However, stains exposed to benzidine dissolved in glacial acetic acid, leucomalachite green, and o-tolidine failed to yield high-molecular-weight DNA or to produce any RFLP patterns.\r"

Some of the potential pitfalls are reviewed here along with an account of the accidental discovery of two novel chemical forms. Human or mouse red blood cells were exposed to excess sodium nitrite to convert the intracellular pigment to methemoglobin. When these were subsequently incubated in Krebs-Ringer-phosphate-glucose medium, pH 7.4 at 37 degrees C under nitrogen and in the presence of various concentrations of methylene blue, a blood pigment was generated in high yield which had unique properties. In lysates, the pigment was stable in air, and it could be maintained in liquid nitrogen for as long as a year without deterioration. The pigment had properties different from those of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, or carboxyhemoglobin. After separation by isoelectric focusing, the pigment gave a strong signal on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The other forms of hemoglobin given above are EPR-silent. The pigment was eventually identified as the nitrosylated valency hybrid species, (alpha 2+ beta 3+)2(NO)2. The corresponding species, (alpha 3+ beta 2+)2(NO)2, has similar properties. These species apparently owe their unusual stability in air to the presence of the oxidized subunits in the same tetramer.\r"

  ".U": "91311316\r", 
  ".W": "When a forensic toxicologist interprets postmortem blood cocaine findings he usually must make assumptions regarding perimortem drug concentrations. In-vitro studies have shown that cocaine rapidly hydrolyzes in unpreserved blood, particularly at elevated temperatures. However, other studies have demonstrated site-dependent postmortem release of some drugs from tissue stores accompanied by increases in drug concentrations in the blood. This study was undertaken to investigate whether blood cocaine concentrations change in the body during the postmortem interval and, if so, to measure the direction and magnitude of the changes. In medical examiner cases in which scene investigation suggested that the decreased was a cocaine user, blood samples were collected as soon after death as possible. At autopsy, a second set of samples was collected. Analysis of paired samples by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) revealed dramatic differences in the cocaine concentration. The magnitude and direction of the change appears to be site dependent. Usually, but not invariably, cocaine concentration in subclavian vein blood decreases while that in heart, aorta, and femoral vein blood increases during the interval between death and autopsy. The findings emphasize the danger inherent in attempting to estimate the concentration of cocaine in blood at the time of death from postmortem data.\r"

  ".W": "The possible contribution of poppy seed foods to positive opiate urinalysis results, especially from foods available in the Pacific Rim area, has recently become an issue for the U.S. Army Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory in Hawaii. To assess the likelihood of this possible contribution, seven different poppy seed food products were consumed by male and female volunteers, and urine specimens were collected at time increments up to either 24 or 72 h. Specimens were evaluated for opiates using Roche Abuscreen radioimmunoassay (RIA), and all RIA positive specimens were analyzed for morphine and codeine using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Poppy seed cake, bagels, muffins, and rolls did not contain sufficient quantities of poppy seeds to give rise to opiate positive specimens by U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) GC-MS cutoff levels (morphine = 4000 ng/mL, codeine = 2000 ng/mL), although a number of specimens were positive by National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) cutoff levels (morphine and codeine = 300 ng/mL). However, ingestion of poppy seed streusel or Danish pastry led to confirmed morphine and codeine positive specimens, irrespective of the use of DOD or NIDA confirmation cutoff values. In addition, significant amounts of codeine were observed in a number of these specimens. These findings argue against the unqualified application of previously published quantitative guidelines for eliminating poppy seed ingestion as a possible cause for a positive opiate urinalysis result.\r"

Less clearly defined is the position of the forensic toxicologist vis-a-vis other socially significant problems. However, as the 21st century approaches, it is worth considering how forensic toxicology can help in unraveling some of these problems. The problem of violence between intimates--that is, domestic violence--is a social problem in which it has been long felt that alcohol has played a part. Until now, though, no carefully controlled toxicological studies have been conducted to substantiate this or to determine whether other drug use is associated with domestic violence. At the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office, toxicological data from both the victim and the suspect in 20 cases of domestic violence that ended in homicide have been gathered. It was found that alcohol or other drugs or a combination of these factors was invariably present in the suspect, the victim, or both. The implications of these results and how they can be used to develop a toxicological strategy to help reduce the most serious consequences of domestic violence are presented.\r"

Though the Tarasoff issue is but a minor legal point in Clark, a possible consequence of Clark is that a Tarasoff warning could be deemed nonconfidential and admissible in a criminal trial. Psychotherapists could therefore be testifying in criminal courts as prosecution witnesses. While the possibility of a chilling effect on patients' disclosure of violent ideation in the context of psychotherapy first caused apprehension after the California Supreme Court's 1976 decision in Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, this same Court's ruling in People v. Clark some 14 years later may ensure that this fear finally becomes realized.\r"

Research diagnostic criteria determined the subjects clinical symptoms. The results show that three factors characterize MAMP abuse: significant correlation was found between the years of abuse; the manifestation of somatic or mental disorders or both, and alcohol (Alc) addiction. MAMP abusers who were nondrinkers or light drinkers developed a tendency to dislike Alc after MAMP abuse, while there was no change in Alc consumption in heavy drinkers. The findings suggest that the combined abuse of MAMP and Alc aggravates somatic and mental disorders and that Alc plays an important role in the fatal effect of MAMP, especially from small doses. This provides support for the synergistic effects between MAMP and Alc. Coadministration of MAMP and Alc appears to produce long-acting and more complicated changes in the brain's neurotransmitter function.\r"

The accuracy of self-reported stature for older persons and especially for tall and short people is not well ascertained. Examination of published reports provides evidence that beginning at age 45, people compound their stature overestimation by an additional amount related to age (women by twice the amount of men). Analysis of anthropometric data from 8000 U.S. Army personnel indicates that the amount of general overestimation of stature by men is 2 1/2 times greater than that by women. Neither tall men nor tall women underestimate their stature, but men in the upper third of the stature range, and women in the upper 10%, self-report their stature with greater accuracy. No trends in accuracy are apparent in the remainder of the stature spectrum for men or women.\r"

During the early adult years, maxillary suture obliteration progresses at nearly the same rate in both sexes; however, the age of old individuals may be greatly overestimated using this method. Although this method cannot be used for exact estimates of individual age, it is valuable in establishing the age range, sorting commingled remains, and estimating skeletal age when only the maxilla is present.\r"

The correlation between actual age and the D/L ratio of aspartic acid was investigated by analyzing not only the total amino acid but also its fractionated substances, insoluble collagen and soluble peptide. The coefficient values of correlation between the D/L ratio and actual age in adult lower central incisors were 0.996 (sigma = +/- 1.0 year) for the total amino acid, 0.988 (sigma = +/- 1.8 years) for insoluble collagen, and 0.997 (sigma = +/- 0.9 years) for soluble peptide. The corresponding figures in adult first premolars were 0.991 (sigma = +/- 1.6 years), 0.988 (sigma = +/- 1.9 years), and 0.994 (sigma = +/- 1.4 years), respectively. The reactive velocity of aspartic acid racemization was highest for soluble peptide in both the lower central incisors and first premolars and approximately three times as rapid as that for total amino acid. As a result, age estimated from the analysis of soluble peptide was most accurate. The velocity for insoluble collagen was slightly lower than that for total amino acid. Age estimation was attempted from the teeth of an unknown body. These results suggest that the analyses, not only of total amino acid in dentin but also of its fractionated and extracted substances, can lead to higher reliability in age estimation. Soluble peptide, in particular, has been found to be most effective.\r"

To assess the accuracy of driver's license information, volunteers' statures were measured, and then these figures were compared with those printed on the subjects' licenses. Even in our comparatively young, well-educated sample, the license height was significantly greater than the measured height. Some inaccuracies may be caused by failure to update license information when new licenses are issued, but some inaccuracies may be from personal deception.

Elevated serum tryptase levels (range = 12 ng/mL to 150 micrograms/mL) were found in nine of nine Hymenoptera sting fatalities, six of eight food-induced fatalities, and two of two reactions to diagnostic therapeutic agents. Tryptase levels were normal (less than 10 ng/mL) in 57 sequential sera obtained postmortem from six control patients. Tryptase could not be measured in pleural or pericardial fluids for technical reasons. Serum IgE antibodies were elevated in five of the nine Hymenoptera sting fatalities and in eight of the eight fatal food reactions; assays were unavailable for the two diagnostic/therapeutic agents. If elevated, the victim's serum IgE antibodies to food could be used to identify allergens in uneaten portions of foods consumed shortly before the anaphylactic event. IgE antibodies were moderately stable during storage in a variety of anticoagulants at room temperature for up to 11 weeks. Elevated mast-cell-derived tryptase levels in postmortem sera reflect antemortem mast cell activation and may be used as a marker for fatal anaphylaxis. If assays are available for IgE antibodies to relevant allergens, such assays provide evidence for antemortem sensitization; these assays may be modified to identify allergens in foods consumed by victims of food-induced anaphylaxis.\r"

The authors discuss the case of a 51-year-old male who died six days after suffering extensive head trauma in a motor vehicle collision. At autopsy, white-gray emboli were found in several subsegmental pulmonary arteries. The results of histologic examination with the hematoxylineosin stain gave the impression that the emboli were necrotic cerebral tissue; however, routine special stains for neural tissue produced inconclusive results. Immunohistochemical staining of the emboli with monoclonal mouse anti-human neurofilament protein (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, California) confirmed the cerebral nature of the emboli. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of pulmonary embolization of cerebral tissue confirmed by immunohistochemistry.\r"

A theoretical model based on the development of cognitive schema, consistent with clinical and research data, considers schizophrenia and paranoid schizophrenia as involving fundamental disturbances in boundary articulation and recognition constancy, and considers borderline personality disorders as involving disturbances in evocative constancy. Also, a lack of integration of object and self-schema, expressed in either a distorted and exaggerated preoccupation with interpersonal relatedness or self-definition, defines two primary personality configurations that have implications for understanding the neuroses and subtypes of depression, as well as differential response to various types of psychotherapeutic intervention.\r"

Of the 24 patients treated as part of this training in panic control therapy, 14 were panic-free after treatment and three additional patients showed moderate improvement and decreased frequency of panic. A case example is presented to demonstrate the application of behavioral techniques to individual patients. Discussion is focused on issues surrounding training in behavioral methods and problems in exporting behavioral technology to centers that emphasize psychopharmacological approaches to treatment.\r"

The screener with a high early dropout rate was seen as being more passive and less potent, and offering less new understanding than other screeners. Patients who dropped out early experienced a less strong helping alliance, felt they gained less new understanding, liked the clinician less well, felt less well liked and less respected, and saw the interviewer as more passive and psychotherapy as less potent than did continuers.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a pet on psychological consequences of stress (i.e., state and trait anxiety levels) of college students was examined under three test conditions (i.e., reading aloud, reading quietly, and interacting with a friendly but unknown dog). A repeated-measures analysis of variance with three covariates was used to examine the effect of the treatment on each dependent variable (state and trait anxiety). Reading aloud differed from baseline measure under all treatment conditions (p less than .001). Reading quietly and interacting with the dog were slightly below baseline for variables, with more effect seen by reading quietly than by interacting with the dog. Examination of interactions among variables showed no significant differences. Effects upon state anxiety were significant, while trait anxiety levels remained fairly constant throughout the treatments. Baseline differences in trait anxiety scores indicate a potentially greater benefit for pet owners than nonowners. Selected social network and relationship data related to the role of the pet during anxiety-producing times were also analyzed. While interaction with the pet produced a decrease in anxiety level, pet owners did not report the use of their own pet as a social support (i.e., as confidant) significantly more than did previous owners. Results indicated that interacting with a pet for some individuals does affect both physiological and psychological responses by lowering response levels. However, a parallel effect was also seen by reading quietly. Given the effect of pet interaction upon selected social support indicators of health in well college students, these data suggest the importance of examining this treatment with an \"at-risk\" group in which it is possible to control for ownership characteristics.\r"

Alexithymia--an inability to express emotions verbally, operational thinking, and a lack of fantasy life--is found in a high proportion of psychosomatic patients. We therefore tested the hypothesis that diabetics would be more alexithymic than controls. In addition, the lack of awareness of affect was hypothesized to have negative consequences for the management of diabetes, as reflected in metabolic glucose control (HbA1). The number of emotion words produced in six imaginative (Thematic Apperception Test) stories was used as the measure of alexithymia, with few words reflecting alexithymic characteristics. Diabetics were found to be significantly more alexithymic than controls. Further, fewer emotion words (alexithymia) was associated with poorer metabolic control. These data suggest that alexithymic characteristics may interfere with a diabetic's ability to manage their illness, and support previous research showing that the suppression of emotions can lead to a difficulty in regulating glucose levels.\r"

Items in each condition had been matched previously for difficulty and consistency to determine whether diminished recall during distraction represented a true differential deficit. Results showed similar patterns for both types of indices: normal subjects performed better than patients across both conditions, patients recalled less after presentation of a distractor than during a neutral condition, and normal subjects showed no performance decrement between the two conditions. These findings demonstrated that the differential deficit was due to changes in schizophrenic patients' sensitivity to stimulus items, not response biases.\r"

  ".W": "Sera from 23 patients with acute Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS), 15 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and from 40 age-matched blood donors were analysed for antibodies to acidic glycosphingolipids from human brain and peripheral nerve. Antibodies to ganglioside LM1, the major ganglioside of peripheral nerve myelin. were found in 43% of GBS and in 67% of CIDP patients' sera, and in 20% of the blood donors. However, antisulphatide antibodies were detected in 65% and 87% of the sera from GBS and CIDP patients, respectively, but only in 15% of the control sera. Sulphatide is the major acidic glycosphingolipid in myelin and its concentration in peripheral nerve myelin is 100 times higher than that of LM1. The high frequency of LM1 and, in particular of sulphatide antibodies, might thus be relevant to the pathogenesis of the GBS and CIDP.\r"

The neoplastic cells in the two cases had an abnormal shape and showed positive GFAP immunostaining in their cytoplasm. The numbers of AgNORs were counted in central and peripheral lesions of the neoplastic field in each case. The mean AgNOR scores in neoplastic cells were almost the same as those of nonneoplastic astrocytes in both the central and the peripheral lesions. These values were almost equal to the AgNOR score of low-grade gliomas. These findings indicate that gliomatosis cerebri has an invasive character in the central nervous system and often shows a malignant tendency, but its proliferative potential is significantly lower than that of high-grade gliomas.\r"

All cases were registered with the study either by notification from general practitioners (GPs) or by a check of hospital admission within the study area and in the two hospitals of Perugia. There were 94 incident cases of TIAs (45 males, 49 females), thus giving a crude rate of 0.64 per 1000 per year [95% conficence intervals (CI) 0.52/0.78]. The rate adjusted to the European population is 0.42 (CI 0.33/0.54). Mean age was 69.4 years, and females were significantly older than males. The weighted relative risk for males was 1.19 (CI 0.79/1.79). Thirty-one patients were treated at home by their GPs. Females had hypertension more frequently than males, whereas males smoked more frequently; we did not find any other statistically significant difference in the distribution of risk factors. Twelve patients out of 58 who had CT had an infarct, and 29 out of 54 submitted to Doppler ultrasonography had carotid stenosis. At 1 month, 4 patients had suffered an ischaemic stroke, 1 of whom died. At 6 months, 3 further strokes and 2 further deaths (1 due to myocardial infarction) had occurred.\r"

Autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons were identified in the serum of both patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of one. Both died suddenly and unexpectedly. General autopsy did not reveal the cause of death. Neuropathological studies revealed perivascular gliosis in the spinal cord and brain stem of one patient and lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord, brain stem, and basal ganglia of the other. The occurrence of a chronic inflammatory reaction in one of the two patients supports the idea that an autoimmune disease against GABA-ergic neurons may be involved in SMS. A review of the literature indicates that functional impairment in SMS is severe and prognosis is unpredictable because of the potential for sudden and unexpected death. Both muscular abnormalities and autonomic dysfunctions may result from autoimmunity directed against GABA-ergic neurons.\r"

Of the subjects with carotid stenosis 27.6% were hypertensive smokers in comparison with 9.5% and 17.2% in the two control groups. The difference of the stenosis cohort from the two control groups was significant (P less than 0.01 and P = 0.016 respectively). There was no statistically significant differences between the occurrence of diabetes and hypertension in non-smokers and patients who smoked. In 394 investigated patients suffering from carotid stenosis or occlusion an obstruction index, based on the Doppler shift frequency, was calculated. This index was lowest in the normotentive non-smokers. It was only insignificantly higher in the hypertensive non-smokers but significantly so in the normotensive smokers. The index was highest in the hypertensive non-smokers. It was concluded that cigarette smoking, especially if associated with hypertension, is a determinant risk factor for carotid stenosis and occlusion.\r"

The maturation process was accompanied by notable changes in cell-surface markers in a time-dependent manner. The percentage of cells expressing CD11c, ICAM-1, HLA-DR, and Fc receptor class III increased while the CD4 and CD35 expression was markedly decreased. After demonstrating that in vitro monocytes mature to macrophages in a recognizable manner, we studied the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection at time points representing different stages of cell maturation. The results show that monocyte/macrophages are susceptible to HIV-1 infection at all stages of differentiation. However, the kinetics of virus replication depends on the degree of maturation at the time of infection. Two major patterns of replication were observed: Infection of monocytes resulted in efficient virus production measurable by reverse transcriptase activity in culture supernatant, whereas infection of fully differentiated macrophages yielded low but sustained virus release only demonstrable by p24 antigen assay. We were not able to detect differences in the capacity of the virus to infect and replicate in monocyte/macrophages with respect to cellular origin of the virus isolate and whether the viruses were laboratory-adapted strains or low-passaged patient isolates.\r"

Interaction of HIV-1 with epithelial cells was examined using mucosal explants from Peyer's patches of mice and rabbits. HIV-1 adhered to the luminal membranes of M cells of both species, and was endocytosed and delivered to intraepithelial spaces containing lymphocytes and macrophages. These observations suggest that M cells, which are numerous in the human rectal mucosa, may efficiently deliver HIV-1 to target cells in mucosal lymphoid tissue, and that such transport may contribute to sexual transmission of AIDS.\r"

HIV DNA was measured in PBMCs at intervals using a recently developed quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The amount of HIV DNA ranged from 2,000 to 40,000 copies of provirus per microgram of cellular DNA. The HIV provirus copy number showed little change with time in five patients, and increased and then remained constant in one patient. Thus, prolonged treatment with ZDV does not decrease the levels of HIV DNA in PBMCs.\r"

These two study groups provided us the opportunity to compare CSF changes (cells, protein, albumin index, IgG, IgG index, and IgG synthesis rate) in neurologically normal individuals with respect to immunological status over time. We found significantly increased intrathecal cellular response and IgG production over time independent of CD4 group. We conclude that any clinical study comparing CSF findings in neurologically symptomatic HIV-infected individuals must recognize and control for these CSF changes in neurologically asymptomatic patients.\r"

The results show that the norepinephrine response in HIV+ subjects compared to that of HIV- subjects was blunted. Examination of the responses using linear and quadratic orthogonal polynomials suggested that these differences between the two groups were primarily a function of their rate of increase in norepinephrine levels. It was observed also that in HIV+ subjects, norepinephrine level peaked earlier than that in HIV- subjects.

Seventy-eight percent of the seropositives but only 43% of the seronegatives correctly anticipated their results. Twelve months after notification (but not earlier), notified seropositives reported significantly greater increases in total distress than nonnotified controls. However, notified seronegatives demonstrated significantly lower levels of hopelessness than nonnotified controls at every follow-up assessment. Thus, knowledge of HIV antibody status appears to dispel a sense of gloom in persons who incorrectly believe themselves to be infected with HIV, but does not appear to induce significant distress in those whose expectation of a positive result is confirmed. Both groups reported lower distress than men with ARC or AIDS, suggesting that distress was related more to symptomatology than knowing antibody status. These results suggest the benefits of HIV testing for the considerable proportion of seronegative subjects believing themselves to be seropositive and should be weighted against the more limited induction of distress in seropositives who receive confirmation of their test result expectation. The benefits of testing are also supported by increasing knowledge of the usefulness of early intervention in HIV disease.\r"

Parametric estimates of the median incubation period of TA AIDS in adults vary from 6.5 to 11 years according to the type of distribution assumed (Weibull or gamma) and the latest year of diagnosis included (1987 or 1988). The latter finding may reflect a lengthening of the incubation period due to increasing treatment of HIV-infected patients prior to the development of AIDS. It is predicted that, by the end of 1991, between 2,000 and 3,000 cases of AIDS will have been diagnosed in Europe among adults infected by transfusion between 1978 and 1985 (when systematic screening of donated blood was introduced in most western countries). It is not possible, however, to predict how many further cases may arise among those transfused more recently in countries in which screening was introduced at a later date.\r"

Candidate genes evaluated were HLA-DQA1 and -DRB1, complement C4A and C4B, alpha- and beta-interferons, and the heavy chain of immunoglobulin gamma 1. Of the 114 men, 29 were asymptomatic, 21 were symptomatic men and AIDS patients (p = 0.02). Specifically, the HLA haplotype DRB1*0702-DQA1*0201 was associated with absence of symptoms (p = 0.003). Conversely, the frequency of the complement C4B-L allele was higher among patients with symptoms or with AIDS than among asymptomatic subjects (p = 0.02). These results suggest that genes in or near the major histocompatibility complex may influence the rate of disease progression among HIV-1-infected men.\r"

In this study, 324 seronegative participants in the San Francisco Men's Health Study were evaluated for evidence of infection using a PCR testing algorithm with multiple amplifications targeting different regions of the HIV-1 genome. While most PCR reactions were negative, 8.6% of the specimens showed weak reactivity with one or more primer sets. However, all were negative with at least one primer set and no definitively positive specimens were identified. This study addressed the possibility that some of these PCR reactions might represent latent infection or abortive exposure, leaving residual integrated DNA, rather than false-positive reactions. The frequency of such reactions was determined in homosexual men who have been at risk for HIV-1 infection and in exclusively heterosexual men who have little or no past exposure. The results demonstrate an identical frequency and distribution of equivocal PCR reactions in both populations. Assuming that there is minimal HIV-1 infection among seronegative heterosexual men in San Francisco, we conclude that PCR testing does not provide evidence for a reservoir of occult HIV-1 infection in seronegative homosexual men.\r"

We searched the literature through MEDLINE (1966-89), Index Medicus (1956-65), Excerpta Medica (1982-89), Science Citation Index (1982-89), and bibliographic review of located articles. Of a total of 341 citations, we identified 7 prospective trials that specifically addressed the stated purpose. We independently assessed the quality of the selected trials, using published methodological criteria and summarized the effect of treatment on arthritis activity and the incidence of side effects. The trials we evaluated tested various drug combinations. Because of deficiencies in methods and reporting, only 3 trials had sufficient quality to yield strong or moderately strong evidence. None conclusively demonstrated benefit of a drug combination: 2 suggested such benefit, including 1 also suggesting increased toxicity; the 3rd suggested only increased toxicity. The other 4 trials yielded weak evidence to support both increased efficacy and toxicity. The advantages of any antirheumatic drug combination remain unproven. Because these advantages are likely to be modest, they can only be shown in rigorously designed trials enrolling large numbers of patients. Methods and reporting of antirheumatic drug trials should be standardized to allow combining of study results.\r"

Of the 91 patients who completed 24 months of therapy, a significant (p = 0.0001) improvement was noted compared to baseline in all clinical disease variables and the Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Marked improvement occurred in 94 (76%) and 98 (80%) of the patients in the joint pain/tenderness index and joint swelling index at the last evaluable visit (mean 26 months). Of the 77 patients with an elevated ESR at baseline, 29 (38%) patients normalized it (less than 20 mm/h) while receiving therapy (p less than 0.01). A significant reduction in prednisone dose was also seen. Adverse events occurred frequently but were generally mild in severity. Twenty-seven patients (22%) withdrew during the study. Four (3%) withdrew due to lack of efficacy, and 6 (5%) because of adverse experiences. The overall probability of continuing therapy in the study for 48 months was projected at 72%. This large prospective study supports the observation of earlier smaller studies that MTX is an effective drug in the treatment of RA.\r"

Nine healthy pregnant women and 5 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were used for comparison. Serum prolactin (PRL), testosterone and estradiol (E2) levels were determined by RIA. The patients with SLE showed higher serum PRL levels, the difference being statistically significant at Week 20, and reaching the highest levels at Weeks 30 to 40 (p = 0.05 when compared to healthy pregnant women). The 5 patients with active SLE had the highest serum PRL levels; one of these had fetal wastage. In active SLE the serum testosterone and E2 levels were decreased significantly from Weeks 10 to 30 compared with controls (p = 0.001). In patients with RA serum PRL levels, although higher than in controls, did not differ significantly, nor did the lower testosterone and E2 levels. We conclude that gonadal hormones and PRL changes observed in SLE are present also during pregnancy and may be related to fetal wastage and reactivation of disease.\r"

All sera positive for one or more autoantibodies to a selected panel of nuclear antigens could be segregated into one of 5 profiles. The distribution of individual autoantibodies and profiles in the sera of patients with various connective tissue diseases were compared in terms of their respective diagnostic predictive value and sensitivity. The application of these profiles improved the sensitivity and diagnostic predictive value of these tests when compared to individual autoantibodies without loss of specificity, thus aiding clinical interpretation.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate whether disease exacerbations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are accompanied or preceded by changes in antibody levels against the U1RNA associated 70 kDa and A polypeptides, we prospectively collected plasma specimens from 71 patients with SLE. We compared changes in anti-70 kDa/anti-A levels, measured by ELISA using cloned antigens, with changes in levels of anti-dsDNA and total IgG. Measurable levels of anti-70 kDa (n = 10) and/or anti-A antibodies (n = 6) were detected during 10 exacerbations. Four of the 10 exacerbations with a measurable level of anti-70 kDa antibodies were preceded by a significant rise in anti-70 kDa levels, 2 by a significant fall, while levels of anti-70 kDa did not change in the remaining 4 cases. Only one of the 6 exacerbations with detectable anti-A antibody levels was preceded by a significant rise in anti-A antibodies, while levels did not change before exacerbation in the other 5 cases. Six of the 10 exacerbations were preceded by a significant rise in anti-dsDNA; in 4 cases levels of anti-dsDNA did not change before exacerbation. In contrast to anti-dsDNA, no relation was found between changes in levels of anti-70 kDa/anti-A and changes in disease activity. Significant changes in levels of anti-70 kDa/anti-A, occurring in 6 cases, were accompanied by parallel changes in total IgG in 5 of these 6. We conclude that, in contrast to anti-dsDNA, serial measurement of levels of anti-70 kDa/anti-A is not useful for monitoring disease activity or predicting disease exacerbations in SLE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most sera detected at least 1 of these 4 nonhistone chromosomal proteins. Fifteen percent of the sera immunoprecipitated ribonucleoproteins; some exhibited a novel specificity, precipitating mature transcripts of RNA polymerase III. When present, antibodies to a 45 kDa protein occur only in sera from children without iritis and not in those with active iritis.

We performed SF analysis including supravital (SV) stains for differential counts on 100 consecutive relatively noninflammatory synovial fluids defined as any SF with less than 2,000 cells/mm3. SV stains gave clear cellular morphology. Monocytes were the most prominent cells in all noninflammatory synovial fluids. Thirty-eight fluids were found to have crystals (monosodium urate (MSU) in 15, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) in 5, CPPD plus apatite-like crystals in 9, apatite-like clumps alone in 8 and lipid liquid in 1). WBC counts, percentages of polymorphonuclear (PMN) and absolute PMN counts were greatest in fluids with MSU or CPPD crystals. Fluids with apatite-like clumps alone tended to have the lowest WBC counts. The presence of WBC over 500 cells/mm3, over 20% PMN and absolute PMN counts over 250 cells/mm3 should encourage a careful search for crystals, especially MSU, in noninflammatory synovial fluids.\r"

  ".W": "Transection of the anterior cruciate ligament in the dog is used frequently to produce a model of osteoarthritis (OA). Although it results in metabolic, biochemical, biomechanical and morphological changes in the articular cartilage of the unstable knee which resemble those in human OA, it rarely results in full thickness cartilage loss. The lack of progression of the cartilage lesions in this model has generally been attributed to stabilization of the joint by osteophytes and capsular fibrosis which develop following transection of the ligament. In our study transection of the anterior cruciate ligament of adult foxhounds and mongrels resulted in a progressive increase in the amount of articular cartilage in the unstable knee. In articular cartilage from the medial femoral condyle of the unstable knee the total amount of proteoglycan, as assessed by hexuronic acid analysis, and, often, the proteoglycan concentration were increased. Furthermore, the rate of proteoglycan synthesis was commonly elevated, in comparison with that from the contralateral knee. Thus, in these animals knee instability did not lead to loss of cartilage but to an active synthetic response by the chondrocytes resulting in hypertrophic cartilage repair which was sustained for up to 64 weeks of observation.\r"

  ".W": "To help elucidate the longterm outcome in the unstable knees of dogs that have undergone anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection, conventional radiography, gait analysis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed serially on 3 dogs over a 45-month period after ACL transection. Gait analysis showed that vertical forces generated by the cruciate deficient leg were smaller than those produced by the contralateral leg, but the decrease in loading was not progressive and clinical findings did not suggest that the dogs developed pain in the unstable limb. Despite progressive osteophytosis and subchondral sclerosis, as seen on plain radiographs, MRI demonstrated that articular cartilage in the unstable knee was thicker than that in the contralateral knee 36 months after ACL transection. Nine months later, however, striking focal loss of articular cartilage was seen in the unstable knee of each dog. Our study, which provides the first longterm observations of the changes in the unstable knee after ACL transection, shows that they represent progressive osteoarthritis and emphasizes that a prolonged phase of cartilage hypertrophy may precede the stage of cartilage breakdown.\r"

The benefit of amitriptyline was assessed using a symptom questionnaire and count of tender points. To assess the usefulness of the method, the proportion of trials that provided a definite answer was examined. Completing the trial resulted in reaching a high degree of confidence in the final management decision in 74% of trials. In 35% of trials, results led to discontinuation of the drug which otherwise would have been continued indefinitely. The drug benefit, if present, was evident within first 2 weeks of therapy. We concluded that these results support the feasibility and usefulness of N-of-1 RCT in rheumatology practice.\r"

Mean patient age was 32 years (range 13 to 87 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 3:1. Mean followup was 7 months (median 4 months). Of the patients 72% had a minor renal injury, 17% had a moderate injury and 11% had a major renal injury. Treatment was conservative in 114 patients, while 9 underwent a genitourinary operation. Results were excellent in 87% of the patients and good in 8%, while 5% failed treatment. All patients who had microscopic hematuria without shock had minor injuries. Excretory urograms (IVPs) were normal in 74% and 39% of the patients when performed for minor and moderate renal injuries, respectively. Computerized tomography (CT) was abnormal in all cases when performed, and was more sensitive and specific than an IVP. Therefore, the majority of patients with blunt renal trauma can be treated conservatively with an excellent result. Furthermore, radiological investigations are not needed in those with microscopic hematuria and no shock. When radiological investigations are indicated a CT scan is the imaging study of choice.\r"

The situations that required nonstandard positioning techniques included stones in the distal or mid ureter, renal transplant, gallbladder or common bile duct, and unusual body habitus, such as myelomenigocele, bilateral lower extremity amputations and children with stones. Positioning with adequate focus of the shock wave was achieved in 87% of the patients and fragmentation was achieved in 89%. The Stryker frame gantry modification is an excellent method to circumvent positioning problems with the Dornier HM3 lithotriptor, extending lithotripsy capability to patients who might otherwise not be candidates.\r"

A eutectic mixture of local anesthetics, a hydrophylic cream containing 25 mg. lidocaine and 25 mg. prilocaine per gm., proved to be effective for local analgesia. Therefore, we investigated its effectiveness during ESWL. With randomized, double-blind application the eutectic mixture of local anesthetics and placebo were evaluated in 83 patients according to the percentage of patients who required intravenous analgesia during ESWL. Of 40 patients treated with the eutectic mixture of local anesthetics 12 (30%) needed supplementary fentanyl citrate, compared to 23 of 43 (53%) placebo treated patients. Although there is no statistical significance (p = 0.32), the eutectic mixture of local anesthetics does decrease pain during ESWL and it should be particularly useful for patients in whom intravenous analgesia is contraindicated.\r"

We reviewed 4,278 kidneys in 3,900 patients treated by 129 urologists using a mobile Dornier HM3 and a mobile Medstone lithotriptor at 21 mobile sites in 6 upper midwest states during 3 1/2 years. These results were compared with those in 524 kidneys in 480 patients treated by our fixed Medstone lithotriptor. After the procedure auxiliary treatments were needed in 3% of the patients treated with the mobile units and 2% of those treated with the fixed unit. The rate in 2 large published series was approximately 9%. The retreatment rates were 5% with the mobile lithotriptors and 6% with the fixed (reported average 16%), and the over-all stone-free rates at 3 months were 69% and 68% (versus 66%). Of note, the mobile units were as effective as the fixed unit against difficult stones. A mobile lithotriptor with a constant support staff that is used 1 or 2 times per month by many trained urologist will perform as well as fixed lithotriptor used regularly by a small unvarying staff of trained urologists.\r"

Complete fragmentation occurred in 79% of the patients treated by the Dornier, 82% treated by the EDAP and 79% treated by the Sonolith devices, with 3-month stone-free rates of 66, 67 and 58%, respectively. Auxiliary procedures were needed in 12% of the patients in the Dornier, 13% in the EDAP and 9% in the Sonolith groups. Repeat treatment was necessary in 4% of the Dornier group, 42% of the EDAP group and 26% of the Sonolith group. Therefore, all 3 lithotriptors are effective in stone disintegration and produce satisfactory results when selection criteria for ESWL are observed. The most significant difference among the 3 lithotriptors is the number of repeat treatments, which reflects the power and energy output of the lithotriptors. In conclusion, the Dornier HM3 device has the advantage of low repeat treatment rate and easier stone localization. The EDAP LT 01 unit has the advantage of lower treatment costs and anesthesia-free treatment with no irradiation. The Sonolith 2000 device has features of the other 2 lithotriptors with a superior ultrasound image.\r"

In physiological hydronephrosis the dilated ureter extends down only to the level of the common iliac artery. In 2 patients with distal ureteral stones a dilated ureter was visualized past the vessels. To determine the frequency and reliability of visualizing the ureters in pregnant patients 105 consecutive asymptomatic pregnant patients were examined. Hydronephrosis was found in 83 kidneys in 59 of the patients. The dilated ureter was visualized in 64 of the renal units. The anatomy was well demonstrated by color flow Doppler scanning and in all of these cases the dilated ureter was seen to taper where it crossed the common iliac artery. These results suggest that the presence of a dilated ureter past the iliac artery is strong evidence for pathological distal ureteral obstruction in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 29 patients received an ileal segment interposition between the upper and lower urinary tract for partial or total ureteral substitution, or for ileal wrapping around a massively dilated, aperistaltic ureter. Indications for an operation included the presence of an extensively diseased or short ureter and an aperistaltic megaureter that had failed previous reconstructive attempts. Nine patients (group 1) underwent an ileal sleeve procedure in an attempt to increase the ureteral peristaltic activity and facilitate drainage. Among these patients 7 (78%) had a stable upper tract radiologically and normal serum creatinine (less than 1.6 mg./100 ml.), while 2 (22%) had deterioration of the renal function. Ten patients (group 2) had undergone a myriad of reconstructions that failed and then underwent complete ureteral substitution with ileum. Among them, renal function (as evidenced by excretory urography and serum creatinine) is stable in 7 (70%) and deteriorated in 3 (30%). In 10 patients (group 3) the ureters were partially replaced by ileum in addition to a bladder augmentation procedure. Of these patients 8 (80%) have stable renal function and 2 (20%) had renal failure. Over-all, 7 patients have different degrees of renal failure; among them 2 (6.9%) are on dialysis and 2 (6.9%) have received a transplanted kidney. In groups 2 and 3 the results with an antireflux operation indicated that among 6 ureteroileal reimplantations 5 (83%) were successful, among 12 intravesical intestinal nipples 6 (50%) failed to prevent reflux and there was no case of obstruction, while among 4 ileocecal intussusceptions 2 (50%) were successful and 2 failed. Mucous secretion produced temporary ureteral obstruction in 1 ureter (3.4%), which resolved without surgical intervention. Some of the aforementioned procedures were done in the past and in some situations a different reconstructive technique would be considered presently. The surgical complexity and magnitude of the procedures justify their performance only in difficult clinical situations as an alternative to urinary diversion or renal autotransplantation.\r"

Kidney functions were evaluated by 99m technetium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid scans and by determination of the 24-hour creatinine clearance. Urine cultures were obtained, and urine viscosity and flow rates were measured. A urographic study, including ascending cystography, was done every 6 months. Results indicated that the modified operation is functionally superior to the standard procedure. It provides efficient unidirectional flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder with less mucus secretion. This was ultimately reflected as better renal function when it was quantitated by renography and/or chemical clearance.\r"

Followup was 8 to 20 months. Postoperatively, all of the patients were continent during the day but only 4 (66.7%) were continent at night, although they had to awaken twice to remain dry. Neocystourethroscopy in 4 of the 6 patients revealed no tumor and no stricture at the urethrocolonic anastomosis. However, a stone in the neobladder was found in 1 patients. Urodynamic study of the neobladder showed a low pressure (mean 16.7 cm. water) at the filling phase of water cystometry and an adequate maximal urethral closure pressure (mean 52.0 cm. water) and functional profile length (mean 3.8 cm.). The uroflow rate in all patients was good (1 patient even had a maximal uroflow rate of 31 ml. per second). There was no reflux in any patient. One patient had intestinal obstruction 5 months postoperatively and died 5 months later of widespread metastasis. The remaining 5 patients are alive with a satisfactory quality of life. In conclusion, use of completely detubularized sigmoid colon may be an ideal operation for neobladder construction after radical cystoprostatectomy.\r"

Many of these patients had straight erections as children but a ventral curvature developed as they achieved puberty. We describe the anatomical findings and discuss the possible cause for the development of this anomaly. Surgical therapy begins with a circumcising incision and reflection of the skin to expose the shaft of the penis. The corpus spongiosum containing the urethra was mobilized by resecting the dysgenetic tissue in the dartos and Buck's fascia layers. In 1 patient this dissection was sufficient to straighten the penis but in the remaining 25 the penis was not straight. In those patients we mobilized the dorsal bundle of vessels and nerves, and removed 1 or several ellipses of tunica albuginea to equalize the lengths of the ventral and dorsal aspects of the corpora cavernosa. The corpus spongiosum usually is elastic and the curve almost never is caused by shortness of the urethra, which stretches to fit the straightened penis. In 24 of the 26 patients the curvature was resolved with 1 operation, while 2 needed a second procedure.\r"

However, given the interim advances in their urological and rehabilitative care, a quantitative assessment of the germinal epithelium after spinal cord injury and comparison of these parameters to normal controls are warranted. Incisional testicular biopsy was performed in 14 spinal cord injured men. Quantitative micrometric techniques were applied to assess spermatogenesis and the results were compared to a normative data base of testicular biopsies previously obtained from a group of 15 fertile volunteers. From a minimum of 10 randomly selected round seminiferous tubules per subject the mean number of Sertoli cells, mature spermatids, tubular diameter and tubular wall thickness were determined in both groups and statistically analyzed. In the spinal cord injury group the mean number of spermatids per tubule was significantly lower and the mean number of Sertoli cells per tubule was significantly higher than in fertile controls (p less than 0.05). Moreover, the mean Sertoli cell-to-spermatid ratio per seminiferous tubule was significantly higher in the spinal cord injury group and discriminated between spinal cord injured men and controls, with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100% (p less than 0.0001). Half of the spinal cord injury group showed a mean tubular spermatid density of less than 10. Compared to the fertile population, spinal cord injured men show significant differences in quantitative parameters of the germinal epithelium that may contribute to the reproductive dysfunction.\r"

The 3 indications for vena caval resection included tumor clearance (38%), vena caval scar occlusion (14%) and vena caval tumor thrombus (48%). En bloc vena caval resection to achieve tumor clearance was justified by subsequent nodal pathology (cancer in 63% of the specimens and teratoma in 31%). Vena caval resection in the presence of scar occlusion was de facto required by virtue of its incorporation in the specimen. Vena caval resection or thrombectomy is indicated for intraluminal tumor thrombus because thrombus pathology (cancer 35%, teratoma 45% and fibrosis 20%) reflected nodal pathology in 71% of the patients with cancer, 78% with teratoma and 100% with fibrosis. The complications of vena caval resection were generally transitory. The 71% survival rate justifies this intensive surgical approach because these patients had exhausted all chemotherapy options.\r"

The patients were given 6 hyperthermia sessions of 30 minutes each with the temperature controlled on the rectal or urethral surface at 45C. Hyperthermia was well tolerated with mild acute toxicity and no late complications were observed. In the important subjective and objective parameters, major improvement was noted more frequently in the 14 transurethral than in the 22 transrectal hyperthermia treated patients (p less than 0.05). The Food and Drug Administration severity score, prostate volume, post-voiding residual volume and urethral flow showed substantial improvement in 79, 86, 79 and 79%, respectively, of the 14 transurethral hyperthermia treated patients compared to 41, 45, 82 and 82%, respectively, for the 22 transrectal hyperthermia treated patients.

  ".U": "91311773\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate the ability of transrectal ultrasonography to detect residual cancer in the prostate gland after transurethral resection in patients with stage A cancer, we studied 38 patients with stage A disease (11 stage A1 and 27 stage A2) in whom transrectal ultrasonography was done at least 3 weeks after resection. Each patient underwent radical prostatectomy, and residual cancer was present in 97% of the specimens (peripheral zone cancer in 95% and transition zone cancer in 61%). At sonography we identified hypoechoic areas suggestive of cancer in 10 patients (26%). In the pathological specimen residual cancer was present at the hypoechoic area in 8 of these cases (positive predictive value 80%). In a retrospective review of the sonograms we identified 25 hypoechoic lesions greater than 5 mm. in diameter, including 15 that corresponded to cancer in the radical prostatectomy specimens (positive predictive value 60%). Granulomas due to the transurethral resection were found in 92% of the radical prostatectomy specimens but none appeared hypoechoic on ultrasound. A total of 103 separate cancers was identified in the whole mount step sections of the radical prostatectomy specimens (2.7 cancers per patient). Of the 103 separate cancers 54 were less than 0.1 cc in volume and none of these could be identified in the retrospective review of the sonograms, 37 were 0.1 to 1.0 cc and 5 of these (14%) appeared hypoechoic, and 12 were greater than 1.0 cc and 10 of these (83%) appeared hypoechoic. Hypoechoic lesions greater than 5 mm. in diameter in the transition zone proved to be cancer in 47% of the cases, while 88% of similar lesions in the peripheral zone proved to be cancer. We conclude that suspicious-appearing hypoechoic lesions suggestive of cancer, whether in the peripheral zone or the transition zone, should be biopsied before expectant management of stage A prostate cancer is considered. Transrectal ultrasonography is useful for restaging after transurethral resection and for evaluating the extent of residual cancer in stages A1 and A2 prostate cancer.\r"

The clinical and hormonal data were obtained when the presence of metastatic disease was established and treatment was to be initiated in 162 men with metastatic prostate cancer. Mean followup was 16 months (range 1 to 105 months). A total of 70 men (43.2%) died of the metastatic disease during the evaluation period. Log rank analysis revealed that only serum testosterone (p = 0.035) and extent of disease on bone scan (p = 0.003) significantly affected over-all survival. A trend (p = 0.068) towards decreased survival was observed with increasing values of PSA. Increasing values of acid phosphatase positively correlated with extent of disease on bone scan but was not a significant independent prognostic factor. Patient age, performance status, clinical stage, method of initial diagnosis, Gleason grade and type of hormonal treatment did not significantly influence survival. Upon using multivariate Cox analysis, only extent of disease on bone scan was significantly correlated with over-all survival (p less than 0.014). PSA may also be influential but longer duration of followup will be necessary. We conclude that extent of disease on bone scan is the most important prognosticator of the analyzed factors and that serum testosterone may be of value.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 26 previously untreated patients with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate received the pure nonsteroidal antiandrogen nilutamide as a single agent. Objective response rate was 38.5 +/- 18.7% (95% confidence interval). Median progression-free survival and median survival were 9 and 23 months, respectively. Of 13 patients with progression on antiandrogen 5 showed an additional objective response to a second-line endocrine treatment. The drug was generally well tolerated, except for 2 patients who discontinued treatment because of moderate gastrointestinal symptoms. Approximately a third of the patients complained of decreased adaptation to darkness. An electroretinogram and dark adaptation test revealed the presence of functional damage and visual complaints reversed in all patients on cessation of therapy. The other most frequent side effects were slight nausea (26.9% of the patients) and alcohol intolerance (19.2%). A nonsignificant increase in testosterone levels was shown within 1 month of treatment, after which the levels remained stable. Approximately half of the sexually active men claimed maintenance of libido and sexual potency during treatment. A slightly significant increase in hemoglobin was observed during the long term, suggesting the occurrence of a trophic effect by androgens on erythropoiesis. The results indicate that nilutamide as a single agent has an acceptable toxicity and a moderate activity, and may maintain sexual interest in a discrete number of cases. Whether monotherapy with nonsteroidal antiandrogens offers a valid option in the palliation of advanced disease remains to be seen in comparative prospective trials.\r"

  ".W": "We examined 13 cases of small cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract to evaluate and compare the immunocytochemical and ultrastructural features as well as the clinicopathological behavior. Immunohistochemical stains revealed that neuron specific enolase and chromogranin showed differences in staining between the bladder and prostate, as well as between the small cell and adenocarcinomatous components of the prostate. Also, synaptophysin was negative over-all in 12 of 13 cases. Epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen and keratin showed strong focal positivity within the small cell component. Electron microscopy was performed in 4 cases, with 3 demonstrating neurosecretory granules. Clinically, 6 of the 7 patients with adenocarcinoma/small cell carcinoma of the prostate did poorly, all with a survival of 15 months or less. Of 5 patients with transitional cell/small cell carcinoma of the bladder 2 fared better (both had no evidence of disease at 12 months and 11 years, respectively). Based upon the immunostaining and electron microscopic findings, small cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract is heterogeneous in appearance and, therefore, may arise from a multipotential cell of origin. This cell of origin may be organ-specific, as demonstrated by the variability in staining characteristics among the prostate, bladder and kidney, as well as by the differences in the clinical behavior of these malignancies. Small cell carcinoma of the prostate has a poor prognosis, while small cell carcinoma of the bladder may portend a better prognosis if diagnosed at an early stage.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the long-term efficacy of the artificial urinary sphincter, 36 consecutive children in whom a prosthesis was implanted between August 1978 and July 1985 were followed for a minimum of 5 years and re-evaluated within the last 3 months. Of the 36 sphincters 27 (75%) are currently in place; 2 of these 27 sphincters are dysfunctional due to fluid leakage. Of the 25 functioning sphincters 14 have required no further prosthetic operation, 10 needed 1 revision and 1 patient had 5 revisions. Fluid leakage, occurring in 12 patients, was the most common complication requiring reoperation. Twenty patients are completely continent (11 of whom without any medication) and 5 are occasionally damp. The over-all success rate at 2 and 5 years was 84 and 62%, respectively. The mean survival time of the prosthesis was 7.2 years and the mean standard interval was greater than 10.5 years. Patients with higher balloon pressures (81 to 100 cm. water) had more complications, and a decreased rate of success than those with lower pressure balloons (51 to 80 cm. water, p = 0.02). There was no difference in success rates between boys and girls (p = 0.98), although girls who had a prior bladder neck operation tended to have a higher rate of cuff erosion. Sphincters placed after 1980 (model AS800) had a lower reoperation rate than those placed earlier. In selected instances, the artificial urinary sphincter appears to be a viable long-term alternative for management of children with intractable incontinence who have either failed or are unsuitable for other methods of treatment.\r"

In 2 cases the diagnosis was made preoperatively with renal scintigraphy and duplex Doppler sonography. No graft was salvaged, despite timely diagnosis in 2 patients. We conclude that the diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis in the renal allograft recipient should be suspected clinically and by the radiographic findings of absent perfusion on renal scintigraphy, and the detection of an arterial signal, albeit abnormal, on duplex Doppler sonography. When diagnosed, nephrectomy appears to be the only treatment.\r"

We have previously shown that invasive tumors possess the ability to degrade basement membrane. However, the presence of basement membrane may be affected not only by its degradation, but by its synthesis and deposition as well. Our results in the present study suggest that while the invasive human transitional carcinoma cell line EJ has an increased amount of type IV procollagen mRNA when compared to the non-invasive RT4 cell line, type IV collagen staining is absent in the invasive EJ cells and intensely present in the non-invasive RT4 cells. Moreover, when EJ cells were grown on an artificial basement membrane (Matrigel), type IV procollagen mRNA expression was down-regulated to the levels seen with the non-invasive RT4 cells. We also discovered that the invasive cells, when grown on Matrigel, appeared morphologically different from the same cells grown on plastic tissue cultures. We conclude that a deficient basement membrane in invasive cancer cells may be due not only to active proteolytic activity but also to an abnormal production and deposition of extracellular matrix components. In addition, we also demonstrated that basement membrane components may have a significant effect on epithelial cell morphology and gene regulation, and that any alterations of the extracellular matrix-cytoskeleton-nuclear matrix interactions can lead to altered gene regulations and cell function.\r"

Eight to 10 day serial SW exposure (6000 to 8000 shots) decreased the tumor growth in comparison with that of the control. Lung metastases examined by periodic chest X-ray after SW treatment revealed that SW did not promote lung metastases. Pathological findings were also in accord with the X-ray examinations. Polyclonal antibody type 4 collagen was used for immunohistochemical staining of vascular wall in bladder cancer. Vascular wall destruction, not found in spontaneous necrotic tumor, were clearly visible in SW induced necrotic area.

  ".W": "Intravesical treatment with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is an established treatment of carcinoma in situ and an effective prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrence of transitional cell carcinoma. During instillation therapy oral antibiotics may be used to prevent or to treat urinary tract infections. Tuberculostatic agents are employed to prevent or to treat local irritative symptoms and systemic side effects caused by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We investigated the susceptibility of four different Bacillus Calmette-Guerin preparations to 18 antibiotics and to 11 tuberculostatic agents in vitro. All preparations were equally susceptible to most of the commonly used antibiotics and to all of the tuberculostatic agents with the exception of pyrazinamide. Our results suggest that in the absence of cystitis, instillations should not be accompanied by antibiotics because of the possible inhibition of antitumor efficacy by eradication of living Bacillus Calmette-Guerin organisms. The same inhibition may occur when tuberculostatic agents are used to prevent local and systemic complications of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillation therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91311795\r", 
  ".W": "Multidrug resistance in human renal cell carcinoma is mainly caused by expression of the MDR1 gene and is characterized by a broad spectrum cross resistance to many natural product chemotherapeutic agents. This resistance can be overcome by applying chemosensitizers which inhibit the function of the MDR1 gene product P-glycoprotein. The development of new reversing agents with fewer side effects and a higher potency in modifying resistance is a high priority of research on drug resistance. We have evaluated four new verapamil derivatives on 21 primary human renal cell carcinomas in vitro, and also tested them in an MDR-transgenic mice model. These mice express the human MDR1 gene in their bone marrow cells and measurement of their white blood counts provides a simple, rapid and reliable system to screen for the potency of MDR-reversing agents in vivo. We demonstrate here that all four drugs are effective in reversing multidrug resistance in primary cultures of human renal cell carcinomas when used in combination with vinblastine chemotherapy, and to a lesser extent with doxorubicin or daunomycin chemotherapy. Our in vivo data indicate that two of these reversing agents display low toxicity at high concentrations and are more effective at low, clinically achievable concentrations, than the other two drugs and R-verapamil. These results make the two new drugs attractive candidates to be taken into clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Although bladder inflammation is known clinically to produce a variety of symptoms including urgency, frequency, and pain, there are only a few experimental studies that directly relate bladder inflammation with urodynamic and functional alterations. We have used the sensitized guinea pig model to study the effects of inflammation on micturition parameters, cystometry, and in vitro bladder contractility. This model depends on the allergic response of the bladder mucosa to ovalbumin, an otherwise non-irritative agent, as an antigen. In vivo exposure of the bladder to ovalbumin via urethral catheterization induced a prompt and marked increase in the number of micturitions in antigen-sensitized guinea pigs. Ovalbumin had no effects on the micturition parameters in the control group. Using in vivo cystometry, intravesical exposure to ovalbumin induced a significant decrease in both the pressure at which micturition was induced, and the volume at which micturition was induced. Ovalbumin had no effect on cystometric parameters of the control animals. In vitro exposure of whole-bladder preparations to ovalbumin induced a significant contractile response only in the bladders isolated from the sensitized guinea pigs. The responses of the isolated bladders to field stimulation and bethanechol were identical for bladders from both sensitized and control animals. In conclusion, exposure of the bladder to ovalbumin in the sensitized animal induced an increase in the frequency of micturitions and a decrease in the pressure and volume at which micturition was induced. Thus, intravesical exposure of the bladder mucosa to a substance that the bladder has been sensitized to can induce alterations in micturition that are consistent with the clinical symptoms of \"urgency and frequency\".\r"

This study employs a model in which small intestinal segments are perfused with an artificial urine solution over a three hour period. Urease is then added in order to determine its effect on acid-base balance and net intestinal electrolyte transport. Urease created no significant increase in acid load (delta HCO3- = -7.5 +/- 2.2 for controls vs. -8.7 +/- 2.9 for urease group), but did increase the osmolality of the intestinal contents and resulted in a 24% increase in free water loss (p = .037). Analysis of sodium and chloride movement following the addition of urease to the perfusate suggests that both ammonium and bicarbonate are absorbed by the intestinal segment. Thus any acidosis resulting from increased ammonium absorption following the addition of urease appears to be offset by concomitant bicarbonate absorption. The azotemia of urinary diversion appears to be primarily the result of urea absorption, partially the result of ammonium absorption, and is not significantly increased by urease.\r"

Rats with ablated cavernous nerve displayed little or no penile erection, either in response to direct electrical stimulation or to an estrous female rat. A step wise improvement in electrically induced erections was observed by NGF alone, nerve graft alone, and the combination of NGF and nerve graft. Restoration of sexual behavior followed the same pattern obtained with electrical stimulation. Furthermore, the use of neonatal amniotic membrane as an alternative nerve growth matrix enhanced both electrically stimulated erection and mating behavior. These results suggest that the use of NGF and appropriate grafting materials can facilitate autonomic nerve regrowth and potentially reduce the morbidity of surgically induced nerve injuries.\r"

On the other hand, concentrations of aldolase B in normal cortex were 18,100 +/- 10,100 ng./mg. protein (n = 14), whereas the values in RCC were only 130 +/- 270 ng./mg. protein, a significant lowering (p less than 0.01). Immunohistochemically, aldolases A and C were found localized in all RCC tissues (n = 10); aldolase B was faintly stained in only a few tumor cells of two cases (20%). Levels of serum aldolase A were elevated (greater than 300 ng./ml.) in 30 (75%) of 40 patients with RCC as compared to three (6.3%) of 48 individuals with urogenital benign diseases and in seven (21%) of 34 cases with non-RCC urogenital malignancies. Since it is generally accepted that RCC are derived from renal proximal tubules, these findings indicate that aldolase B, the predominant isozyme in the normal case, changes into aldolases A and C during carcinogenesis and that serum aldolase A could be a new useful biomarker for RCC.\r"

  ".W": "There is very little information in the literature on the development of the human vas deferens. Therefore, the age at which the pre- or para-pubertal vas deferens becomes large enough for a vasovasostomy to be technically feasible is unknown. To determine the age or degree of sexual maturity at which a microscopic vasovasostomy is technically feasible, we collected surgical or autopsy vasa from 34 young males over a three year period, and correlated vasal size to age and Tanner stage (degree of sexual maturity ranging from 1-childhood to 5-adult). The specimens were embedded and sectioned transversely in glycol methacrylate. Using image analysis, the total transverse area and diameter, and luminal area and diameter was determined for each specimen. Surprisingly, there was no change in vasal size from birth up through 11 years. From age 15 years and on, the vas was adult in size. The vas develops to adult size between Tanner stages 2 and 3. The average external and luminal diameters of pre-midpuberty specimens (Tanner stages 1 and 2) were 1.0 and 0.19 (mm.) and the diameters of post-midpuberty specimens were 2.1 and 0.43 (mm.), respectively. These results suggest that, in the event of a recognized iatrogenic injury to the vas deferens after midpuberty, a repair by a traditional microsurgical vasovasostomy is possible. If the vas is injured before midpuberty it may be technically difficult to repair by traditional microsurgical methods.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that the human vas deferens does not change in cross-sectional size between birth and the middle of puberty. This suggests that if the human vas is injured prior to mid-puberty, repair by a traditional microsurgical vasovasostomy may be technically difficult. We propose that a chromic stent can be used to assist in the repair of vas injured before mid-puberty. This hypothesis was tested in Sprague-Dawley rats. At three weeks of age, male offspring were divided into three groups (eight to nine rats/group): 1) Sham group--a sham operation at three weeks, 2) VV group--bilateral transection of vasa at three weeks followed by a delayed repair at eight weeks by microsurgical vasovasostomy without a stent, 3) Stent group--bilateral transection of vasa at three weeks followed by immediate repair by aligning the lumens with a 6-0 chromic intravasal stent (suture) and holding the transected ends together with several seromuscular sutures. At four months all rats were fertility tested and a score was given to each rat (mean number of concepti among three females for each male rat). Analysis of anastomotic patency by flow rates and histology was performed. There was no statistical difference in the mean fertility score of 6.85 in the Stent group compared to 7.83 in the Sham group. However, a fertility score of 0.71 in the VV group was significantly decreased compared to the Stent and Sham group (p = .0003), despite no statistical difference between the groups in patency. This suggests that a recognized injury to the pre-pubertal human vas should be immediately repaired and the repair can be done using 6-0 chromic suture as an intravasal stent to help align the lumina of the smaller pre-pubertal vas.\r"

BB rats weighed less than controls and were hyperglycemic. Diabetic rats consumed larger volumes of water and excreted larger volumes of urine than controls. The frequency of micturitions and the mean volumes of urine excreted per micturition were significantly increased in BB rats compared to age-matched controls. Associated with the micturition changes in the BB rats were significant increases in bladder body mass. Contractile responses of strips from bladder bodies and bases were measured in response to nerve stimulation, carbachol, phenylephrine, ATP, and KCl. No significant differences between controls and diabetics were found in the absolute contractile responses of bladder body strips to nerve stimulation, carbachol, ATP, or KCl. However, if the data were transformed to correct for the increases in tissue mass in the diabetics, there were significant decreases in the responses of bladder body strips from BB rats to carbachol, ATP, and KCl, but not to nerve stimulation. Even after transformation, there were no differences in the responses of bladder base strips to carbachol, phenylephrine, or KCl. The data indicate that significant changes in micturition characteristics are evident one year after the onset of diabetes in the spontaneously diabetic BB rat. These changes are slow in development, since they are absent six months after the onset of diabetes. The changes in micturition and bladder strip contractility are qualitatively similar to, but quantitatively modest in comparison with those caused by streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus. The quantitative differences are probably attributable to an ameliorative effect of the insulin received by the BB rat.\r"

In this study we demonstrated in vitro suppression of macrophage chemiluminescent oxidative burst associated with viable cells and cell-free extracts of two urological neoplasms--murine renal cell carcinoma (Renca) and murine bladder tumor (MBT). Suppression was reversed by extracts of two Chinese medicinal herbs, Astragalus membranaceus (AM) and Ligustrum lucidum (LL). Murine macrophage cell line J774 was incubated with either the viable tumor cells or the cell-free tumor extract for 18 hours at 37C and 5% CO2. Chemiluminescent oxidative burst as an indicator of macrophage function was triggered by adding zymosan A suspension containing luminol and assayed in an automated luminometer. Photon emission over time was counted and the results were expressed as integrated photon emission. Significant dose-related depression of oxidative burst occurred with either the viable tumor cells or the cell-free tumor extracts. Depression was partially or completely reversed by the presence of 50-100 micrograms./ml. of either the AM or the LL extract. AM and LL have previously been shown to modulate immune response. Data from this study suggest that they may also exert their antitumor activity via abolition of tumor-associated macrophage suppression.\r"

  ".U": "91312403\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by abnormal electrolyte transport across the epithelia of the airways. In particular, there is excessive sodium absorption and deficient chloride secretion. Drugs that block excessive sodium absorption may provide clinical benefit in cystic fibrosis, but there are no available therapeutic agents to improve chloride secretion. In vitro studies in cultured human-airway epithelia indicate that triphosphate nucleotides (ATP and UTP) induce chloride secretion through apical-membrane purinergic receptors. METHODS. We tested the ability of nucleotides to induce chloride secretion in vivo in 9 normal subjects and 12 patients with cystic fibrosis by measuring responses of nasal transepithelial potential difference (PD) to superfusion of nucleotides. Changes in transepithelial bioelectric properties and the permeability of the apical membrane to chloride in response to extracellular (apical) UTP were determined with ion-selective microelectrodes in cultured nasal epithelia. RESULTS. ATP and UTP induced chloride secretion in vivo in both groups. At their maximal effective concentrations of 10(-4) M, ATP and UTP were more effective chloride secretagogues in the patients with cystic fibrosis (mean [+/- SE] change in PD, -19.8 +/- 1.4 mV and -15.0 +/- 1.7 mV, respectively) than in the normal subjects (-6.9 +/- 0.6 mV and -8.1 +/- 0.9 mV, respectively). Microelectrode studies established that extracellular UTP stimulated a larger increase in PD and chloride secretory current in epithelial cells from patients with cystic fibrosis than in cells from normal subjects, by actions localized to the apical membrane. CONCLUSIONS. Extracellular nucleotides are effective in vivo chloride secretagogues in the nasal epithelia of patients with cystic fibrosis. The equipotency of ATP and UTP suggests that the effect is mediated by P2 nucleotide receptors. Selected nucleotides, such as UTP or nucleotide analogues, should be investigated as therapeutic agents for lung disease in cystic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Spirochetes are commonly associated with periodontal disease, but it is not known whether these treponemes are pathogenic or merely opportunistic. We sought to determine whether spirochetes present in periodontal disease share antigens thought to be unique to spirochetes that are known pathogens. METHODS. We examined dental plaque from 24 healthy subjects, from ulcerative sites in 17 patients with ulcerative gingivitis, and from areas of involvement in 19 patients with chronic periodontitis, using an immunocyto-chemical technique with monoclonal antibodies against pathogen-specific determinants on 47-kd and 37-kd molecules from Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Serum was tested against T. pallidum by immunoblotting and by serologic assays for syphilis. RESULTS. Spirochetes with a pathogen-specific epitope on a 47-kd molecule were not found in plaque samples from any of the 24 healthy subjects, but they were identified in plaque samples from 11 of 17 patients with ulcerative gingivitis (P less than 0.001) and from 10 of 19 patients with periodontitis (P less than 0.01). Monoclonal antibodies directed against a 37-kd molecule reacted with spirochetes in plaque samples from 1 of 14 controls, from all 11 patients with gingivitis from whom samples could be obtained (P less than 0.001), and from 14 of 19 patients with periodontitis (P less than 0.001). Five of 18 normal subjects had IgG against 47-kd and 37-kd molecules, but none had IgG against 14-kd or 12-kd molecules from T. pallidum subspecies pallidum. Among 19 patients with ulcerative gingivitis, IgG was identified against 47-kd molecules in 15, against 37-kd molecules in 12, against 14-kd molecules in 4, and against 12-kd molecules in 15. CONCLUSIONS. The spirochetes found in dental plaque from patients with ulcerative gingivitis or chronic periodontitis have antigens that are thought to be unique to pathogenic treponemes. This close antigenic relation suggests that T. pallidum or a closely related organism may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Osteopenia is a major complication of renal transplantation. Immunosuppressive regimens including cyclosporine, which permit the use of lower doses of glucocorticoids, may reduce glucocorticoid-induced osteopenia. METHODS. We prospectively studied the magnitude, distribution, and mechanism of bone loss in 20 adults who received renal allografts from living related donors, who had good renal function, and who were treated with azathioprine, cyclosporine, and low doses of prednisone. We measured serum biochemical markers of bone metabolism, determined the bone mineral density of the second, third, and fourth lumbar vertebrae and the shaft of the radius, and analyzed the histomorphometric features of iliac bone at the time of transplantation and six months later. Measurements of vertebral mineral density were repeated 18 months after transplantation in 17 of the patients. RESULTS. After transplantation, the mean serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase decreased and the serum calcitriol concentration increased. The mean (+/- SD) bone mineral density of the vertebrae had decreased 6.8 +/- 5.6 percent 6 months after transplantation (P less than 0.05) and 8.8 +/- 7.0 percent 18 months after transplantation. In contrast, the bone mineral density of the radius had increased six months after transplantation (P less than 0.05). The histomorphometric studies showed that the rate of bone formation decreased from 50.5 +/- 44.8 to 23.1 +/- 13.8 microns3 per square micrometer per year (P less than 0.05), and the formation period lengthened from 70 +/- 42 to 146 +/- 144 days (P less than 0.05). Consequently, the amount of bone replaced during a remodeling cycle diminished. CONCLUSIONS. Osteopenia associated with renal transplantation remains a problem in the cyclosporine era. The loss of vertebral bone in our subjects was due to an imbalance in bone remodeling consistent with a toxic effect of glucocorticoids.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Most strains of herpes simplex virus that are resistant to acyclovir are susceptible in vitro to both foscarnet and vidarabine. We conducted a randomized trial to compare foscarnet with vidarabine in 14 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and mucocutaneous herpetic lesions that had been unresponsive to intravenous therapy with acyclovir for a minimum of 10 days. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either foscarnet (40 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously every 8 hours) or vidarabine (15 mg per kilogram per day intravenously) for 10 to 42 days. In the isolates of herpes simplex virus we documented in vitro resistance to acyclovir and susceptibility to foscarnet and vidarabine. RESULTS. The lesions in all eight patients assigned to foscarnet healed completely after 10 to 24 days of therapy. In contrast, vidarabine was discontinued because of failure in all six patients assigned to receive it. The time to complete healing (P = 0.01), time to 50 percent reductions in the size of the lesions (P = 0.01) and the pain score (P = 0.004), and time to the end of viral shedding (P = 0.006) were all significantly shorter in the patients assigned to foscarnet. Three patients had new neurologic abnormalities while receiving vidarabine. No patient discontinued foscarnet because of toxicity. Although initial recurrences of herpes simplex infection after the index lesion had healed tended to be susceptible to acyclovir, acyclovir-resistant infection eventually recurred in every healed patient, a median of 42.5 days (range, 14 to 191) after foscarnet was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS. For the treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex infection in patients with AIDS, foscarnet has superior efficacy and less frequent serious toxicity than vidarabine. Once the treatment is stopped, however; there is a high frequency of relapse.\r"

  ".U": "91312407\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been adopted widely as a treatment for patients with peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities. However, the effect of this procedure on the overall management of peripheral vascular disease and on the outcomes of patients has not been clearly delineated. In particular, it is not known whether angioplasty has replaced other treatments for peripheral vascular disease. METHODS. To assess the extent to which angioplasty is used and the associated changes in the surgical management of peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, we used data on hospital discharges in Maryland to identify all angioplasty procedures, peripheral bypass operations, and lower-extremity amputations performed for peripheral vascular disease in Maryland hospitals between 1979 and 1989. RESULTS. We estimated that from 1979 to 1989 the annual rate of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, adjusted for age and sex, rose from 1 to 24 per 100,000 Maryland residents (P less than 0.0001 by linear regression). Despite this increase in the use of angioplasty, the adjusted annual rate of peripheral bypass surgery also rose substantially, from 32 to 65 per 100,000 (P less than 0.001), whereas the adjusted annual rate of lower-extremity amputation remained stable at about 30 per 100,000. Total charges for hospitalizations during which a peripheral revascularization procedure was performed increased from $14.7 million in 1979 (in 1989 dollars) to $30.5 million in 1989. CONCLUSIONS. In Maryland, the adoption of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities has been associated with an increase in the use of peripheral bypass surgery and with no decline in lower-extremity amputations. These results could be due to increased diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, expanded indications for procedural interventions, or an increased number of repeat procedures performed in patients with peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities.\r"

The anticodon stem is extended by two non-Watson-Crick base pairs, leaving the three anti-codon bases unpaired and splayed out to bind snugly into three separate complementary pockets in the protein.

A cochlear implant system consists of one or more implanted electrodes for direct electrical activation of the auditory nerve, an external speech processor that transforms a microphone input into stimuli for each electrode, and a transcutaneous (rf-link) or percutaneous (direct) connection between the processor and the electrodes. We report here the comparison of the new strategy and a standard clinical processor. The standard compressed analogue (CA) processor presented analogue waveforms simultaneously to all electrodes, whereas the new continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) strategy presented brief pulses to each electrode in a nonoverlapping sequence. Seven experienced implant users, selected for their excellent performance with the CA processor, participated as subjects. The new strategy produced large improvements in the scores of speech reception tests for all subjects. These results have important implications for the treatment of deafness and for minimal representations of speech at the auditory periphery.\r"

The release mechanism displays all-or-none characteristics, that may account for other observations that the InsP3-induced mobilization of Ca2+ is quantal. Quantal release may depend on the sensitivity of the InsP3 receptor being regulated by the Ca2+ concentration in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. We report here that the InsP3-sensitive store in hepatocytes discharges spontaneously when overloaded with Ca2+. The release, which is blocked by heparin, is preceded by an increasing sensitivity of the InsP3 receptor to endogenous InsP3, and is promoted by those sulphydryl reagents (oxidized glutathione and thimerosal) that induce Ca2+ oscillations in intact cells (ref. 8, and T. A. Rooney, D. C. Renard, E. J. Sass and A. P. Thomas, manuscript in preparation). This novel process could have a role in generating both Ca2+ oscillations and Ca2+ waves.\r"

The technique of patch clamping should provide real-time information on such transport and on energy transduction in oxidative phosphorylation. It has been applied to detect microscopic currents from mitochondrial membranes and conductances of ion channels in the 5-1,000 pS range in the outer and inner membranes. These pores are not, however, selective for particular ions. Here we use fused giant mitoplasts prepared from rat liver mitochondria to identify a small conductance channel highly selective for K+ in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This channel can be reversibly inactivated by ATP applied to the matrix side under inside-out patch configuration; it is also inhibited by 4-aminopyridine and by glybenclamide. The slope conductance of the unitary currents measured at negative membrane potentials was 9.7 +/- 1.0 pS (mean +/- s.d., n = 6) when the pipette solution contained 100 mM K+ and the bathing solution 33.3 mM K+. Our results indicate that mitochondria depolarize by generating a K+ conductance when ATP in the matrix is deficient.\r"

  ".W": "In vertebrates, mature eggs are arrested at the second meiotic metaphase by the cytostatic factor (CSF), now known to be the c-mos proto-oncogene product (Mos). Fertilization or egg activation triggers a transient increase in the cytoplasmic free calcium and releases the meiotic arrest by inactivating maturation/mitosis-promoting factor (MPF). CSF or Mos, which is also inactivated by the calcium transient, seems to stabilize MPF in mature eggs and CSF-injected embryos. Thus, it was assumed that CSF inactivation is the primary cause of MPF inactivation on meiotic release. We have directly compared the degradation kinetics of CSF (Mos) and MPF during meiotic release, using the same batch of Xenopus eggs. We report here that, at the molecular level, cyclin subunits of MPF are degraded before Mos is degraded and, at the physiological level, that MPF activity is inactivated before CSF activity during activation of Xenopus eggs. These results, in conjunction with circumstantial evidence, support the novel view that a calcium transient on fertilization induces a CSF-independent pathway for MPF inactivation, whereas CSF inactivation during meiotic release serves only to allow the fertilized egg to enter mitosis.\r"

  ".W": "The retinoblastoma gene (Rb) product is a negative regulator of cellular proliferation, an effect that could be mediated in part at the transcriptional level through its ability to complex with the sequence-specific transcription factor DRTF1. This interaction is modulated by adenovirus E1a, which sequesters the Rb protein and several other cellular proteins, including cyclin A, a molecule that undergoes cyclical accumulation and destruction during each cell cycle and which is required for cell cycle progression. Cyclin A, which also complexes with DRTF1, facilitates the efficient assembly of the Rb protein into the complex. This suggests a role for cyclin A in regulating transcription and defines a transcription factor through which molecules that regulate the cell cycle in a negative fashion, such as Rb, and in a positive fashion, such as cyclin A, interact. Mutant loss-of-function Rb alleles, which occur in a variety of tumour cells, also fail to complex with E1a and large T antigen. Here we report on a naturally occurring loss-of-function Rb allele encoding a protein that fails to complex with DRTF1. This might explain how mutation in the Rb gene prevents negative growth control.\r"

This segment of E7 is homologous to the pRb-binding domains of the simian virus 40 large T and adenovirus E1A transforming proteins. Each of these viral transforming proteins bind to the same region of pRb. To isolate cellular proteins that interact with this viral protein-binding domain on pRb, we used recombinant pRb to screen a human complementary DNA expression library. Two cDNAs were isolated that encode retinoblastoma binding proteins (RBP-1 and RBP-2). We report here that these RBP genes exist in separate loci and produce discrete messenger RNAs. The predicted amino-acid sequence of these genes showed no homology to known proteins, but both RBPs contain the pRb binding motif conserved between E7, large T and E1A14. In vitro expression of the RBP cDNAs yielded proteins that specifically bound to pRb. Recombinant E7 protein, the E7 21-29 peptide and the homologous RBP-1 peptide inhibited RBP-pRb binding. Mutations introduced into the putative pRb-binding segment in RBP-1 impaired its binding activity. These studies indicate that the cellular RBP-1, RBP-2 and viral E7 proteins interact with pRb through similar domains.\r"

  ".W": "The correct attachment of amino acids to their corresponding (cognate) transfer RNA catalysed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is a key factor in ensuring the fidelity of protein biosynthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the interaction of Escherichia coli tRNA(Gln) with glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) provides an excellent system to study this highly specific recognition process, also referred to as 'tRNA identity'. Accurate acylation of tRNA depends mainly on two principles: a set of nucleotides in the tRNA molecule (identity elements) responsible for proper discrimination by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and competition between different synthetases for tRNAs. Elements of glutamine identity are located in the anticodon and in the acceptor stem region, including the discriminator base. We report here the production of more than 20 tRNA(2Gln) mutants at positions likely to be involved in tRNA discrimination by the enzyme. Unmodified tRNA, containing the wild-type anticodon and U or G at its 5'-terminus, can be aminocylated by GlnRS with similar kinetic parameters to native tRNA(2Gln). By in vitro aminoacylation the mutant tRNAs showed decreases of up to 3 x 10(5)-fold in the specificity constant (kcat/KM)14 with the major contribution of kcat. Despite these large changes, some of these mutant tRNAs are efficient amber suppressors in vivo. Our results show that strong elements for glutamine identity reside in the anticodon region and in positions 2 and 3 of the acceptor stem, and that the contribution of different identity elements to the overall discrimination varies significantly. We discuss our data in the light of the crystal structure of the GlnRS:tRNA(Gln) complex.\r"

Temporal characteristics of sound include duration, phase, and repetition rate. In the analysis of human hearing sensitivity, the middle ear system and its impedance characteristics also must be considered. In this article, we have reviewed some major principles of sound and have presented a series of practical clinical applications. Such principles as these help to predict and explain frequency of laryngeal tones, middle ear mechanics, ear canal resonance, real-ear measurements of hearing aids, the Articulation Index, hearing loss, understanding of speech in quiet and in noise, and the relation between hearing and speech.\r"

The sample included 74 nonsmokers, 74 smokers, and 92 self-defined quitters. Subjects' well-being was examined controlling for the effects of daily hassles and selected demographic differences. Measures of well-being included general health, morale, physical, and psychological symptoms. Scores for intensity of daily hassles were significantly higher, and well-being scores lower, for persons quitting smoking compared to smokers and nonsmokers. Further, even after controlling for the effects of daily hassles on well-being, persons quitting smoking had significantly lower levels of well-being than did smokers or nonsmokers.\r"

One hundred and one subjects were randomly placed in one of three groups. Group A received injections in the abdomen, Group B, in the thigh, and Group C in the arm. Each subject received three injections at the one site. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was measured prior to initiation of heparin and again four hours after the first injection. Bruising was measured at 48, 60, and 72 hours postinjection. There were no statistically significant differences among groups for either changes in APTT or bruising at 60 and 72 hours postinjection. Thus the clinical practice of utilizing the abdomen as the only or preferred site for subcutaneous heparin injections was not supported.\r"

Content analysis of interview data was used to identify support categories and their properties. Support needs expressed by caregivers paralleled the general types of support described in the social support literature (emotional, feedback, informational, and instrumental); however, for many categories under each general type the specific meaning of the support was directly linked to the psychiatric caregiving role. Most of the differences in support needs among caregivers from the three age groups reflected the caregivers' stage of life and the length of time they had been caregiving. The group of caregivers of adult patients reported having the least support. Although many support needs were expressed, the needed support did not exist.\r"

In-home interviews were conducted with 225 mothers to obtain data on their everyday stressors, coping strategies, social resources, depressive symptoms, and parenting attitudes, as well as reports of their children's behavior. High depressive symptoms occurred among 59.6% of the women. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with greater everyday stressors, fewer social resources, and greater use of avoidance coping. Neither social resources nor coping strategies buffered the relationship between everyday stressors and depressive symptoms. Maternal depressive symptoms predicted parenting attitudes. Parenting attitudes, in turn, predicted child behavior. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms are indirectly associated with mothers' reports of child behavior through their influence on parenting attitudes.\r"

The sample consisted of 216 middle-class, white, 6 to 11 year old, same-sex twin children. Pairs were randomly split into two subgroups for cross-validation. The MYTH was completed by 88% of the children's teachers. The Perceived Competence Scale was completed by 118 of the 124 children 8 to 11 years old; a parallel form of this instrument was completed by teachers of 108 of these children. The 17 items of the MYTH instrument were factor analyzed. Two factors, Impatience-Aggression and Competitive Achievement-Striving, were derived and cross-validated. These MYTH factors were internally consistent and replicated previous studies of school-age children. The construct validity of the MYTH subscales was partially supported by evidence of relationships between these components of Type A behavior and teacher-ratings of the child's competence in specific domains. Children's ratings of their competence and perceptions of global self-worth were not related to total MYTH scores or subscale scores.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested hypotheses regarding attitudinal and normative influences on intentions to use condoms, a practice that would reduce women's risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection. Participants were 103 sexually active unmarried black women undergraduates at an inner-city commuter university, in an area with a high rate of reported AIDS cases among women. Consistent with the theory of reasoned action, multiple regression analysis on women's anonymous responses to a mailed survey revealed that those who registered more favorable attitudes toward condoms and those who perceived subjective norms more supportive of condom use reported firmer intentions to use condoms in the next three months. Key behavioral beliefs related to attitudes centered on the adverse effects of condom use on sexual enjoyment. Key normative influences were respondents' sexual partners and mothers. However, women's own attitudes were a stronger determinant of intentions to use condoms than were their perceptions of normative influences, particularly among women with above-average AIDS knowledge. The results suggest that the theory of reasoned action provides a potentially useful conceptual framework for interventions to change a key AIDS risk behavior among women.\r"

Physiological variables that were monitored were heart rate, rhythm, dysrhythmias, blood pressure, transcutaneous oxygen (tcpO2), rate pressure product, and behavioral state, measured during 14 circumcision steps. Over the 14 steps, 42% of the heart rates, 78% of the systolic blood pressures (SBP), 30% of the diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and 81% of the tcpO2 pressures were abnormal. Few significant differences were found among any of the steps. SBP and DBP differed significantly between groups during two of the noninvasive steps; and tcpO2 differed significantly during six steps.\r"
