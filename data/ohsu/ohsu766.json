Treatment with hyperbaric 100% oxygen improved the survival rates to 66%, 67%, and 40%. A preservation time of 21 to 24 hours at room temperature appears to be the threshold of irreversible ischemic damage. In acute island flaps, flap survival was improved significantly from 35% to 53% and 64% of the random flap area by preoperative or postoperative treatment, respectively. Prolonged preoperative and postoperative treatment improved survival to 66%.\r"

During a 7-year period, nonobstructing colonic dilatation developed in 13 adults 1 to 13 days after renal transplantation. Twelve (92%) of the 13 had poorly functioning allografts. Five (83%) of the 6 with and 2 (29%) of the 7 without colonoscopy had resolution of nonobstructing colonic dilatation. Of the seven right-sided colon perforations during this period, six were associated with nonobstructing colonic dilatation. An additional 4 patients had diverticular perforations in the left colon. Of a total of 11 patients with colon perforation, 7 had surgery within 24 hours of the perforation and 6 (86%) of these survived. Only 1 (25%) of the 4 having surgery more than 24 hours later survived. Six of the survivors retained functioning allografts. Nonobstructing colonic dilatation seems to be a potential complication of poor graft function after renal transplantation, and colonoscopy is effective in its treatment. In patients with colon perforations, early surgery and reduced immunosuppression are essential in decreasing mortality.\r"

Graft evulsion was preceded by effort and heralded by axillary pain, an expanding hematoma, and a pseudoaneurysm formation. Proximal control of the subclavian artery by a supraclavicular approach or balloon allowed safe wound exploration. Successful reconstruction required lengthening of the graft or replacement. Secondary disruption occurred with simple repair. Although temporary postoperative brachial plexus neuropathy was common, no significant hand ischemia was noted. Twenty-two reports of axillary anastomotic disruption were made to the Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC, during a 2-year period, and one manufacturer of polytef grafts provided data on 10 reports received throughout 7 years. Surface anatomy measurements in 20 control patients demonstrated that arm abduction and lateral flexion of the body increased the distance between the axillary and femoral arteries by a mean of 15.5%. Similar measurements taken from the proximal axillary artery showed a mean length increase of less than 10%. This complication may be avoided by inserting the polytef graft with several centimeters of excess length and positioning the axillary anastomosis medial to the pectoralis minor muscle.\r"

The arterial flow was reestablished and maintained in 5 (38.5%) of the 13. Recurrent thrombosis in the other 8 grafts developed 2 to 24 days (mean, 13.8 days) after transplantation. Reconstruction was successful in 50% (4/8) of the adults, compared with only 20% (1/5) of the children. Satisfactory results were obtained when a definitive cause of thrombosis could be identified. We conclude that early recognition and correction of the cause of hepatic artery thrombosis during or after orthotopic liver transplantation, especially in adults, is often a graft-saving and lifesaving procedure worthy of consideration.\r"

The PTFE is supple and has no plastic memory, while the polypropylene suture is stiff and retains its plastic memory. In addition, the rate of creep encountered in the PTFE suture was significantly less than that of the polypropylene suture. The knotting profiles for knot security for either a square, granny, or surgeon's knot for polypropylene sutures were three throws each. In contrast, knot security with either a square or granny PTFE knot was accomplished with seven throws; six throws were needed for a secure surgeon's knot. The breaking strength of the unknotted and knotted PTFE sutures was approximately one half as great as that for the unknotted and knotted polypropylene sutures. Knot construction significantly reduced the breaking strength of polypropylene sutures but did not alter the breaking strength of PTFE sutures. The percent elongation experienced by both sutures before breakage did not differ significantly. The elasticity, as measured by work recovery, for the polypropylene suture was greater than that for the PTFE suture. On the basis of its unique biomechanical performance characteristics, the PTFE suture should have an important place in vascular and cardiac surgery.\r"

To find out whether granulocytes are further activated during hemodialysis with cellulosic and noncellulosic membranes, we compared the plasma levels of the main granulocyte components in patients with chronic uremia who were undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment and patients with acute renal failure with and without sepsis. During hemodialysis with cuprophane dialyzers, plasma-granulocyte elastase, in complex with alpha-proteinase inhibitor, and lactoferrin levels increased in patients who were undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment, but these levels increased further in patients with acute renal failure who did not have sepsis. Maximal neutrophil degranulation was observed in patients with acute renal failure and sepsis. There was only mild degranulation in all three groups during dialysis with dialyzers made of polysulfone. Our data demonstrate that neutrophil activation is increased in patients with acute renal failure, and it is increased further by superimposed sepsis. Cellulose-containing dialysis membranes introduce a further activation of neutrophils.\r"

Changes in ketone body ratio were classified into the following two types: a primary decrease at the end of operation and a secondary decrease after transient recovery. Patients were classified into three groups by the primary decrease of ketone body ratio: group 1 (183 cases) with ketone body ratio above 0.7, group 2 (49 cases) between 0.7 and 0.4, and group 3 (34 cases) below 0.4 Ketone body ratio was restored to above 0.7 in 2.5 +/- 0.2 days (mean +/- SE) in all group 2 patients. However, though it was restored within 4.5 +/- 0.4 days in 26 group 3 patients, the other 8 died of multiple organ system failure in 7.4 +/- 2.8 days without recovery of ketone body ratio. This was followed by a secondary decrease in ketone body ratio to below 0.7 in 94 patients, concomitant with complications. The degree of the secondary decrease was positively correlated with that of the primary decrease. In the secondary decrease, of 42 patients with ketone body ratio below 0.4, 28 died of multiple organ failure. Total mortality was 7% in group 1, 12% in group 2, and 50% in group 3. It is suggested that the primary decrease in ketone body ratio at the end of operation is a decisive factor in the prognosis for hepatectomized patients.\r"

In all three groups, tumors over 1 g had similar doubling times (5.74 +/- 0.71 d). Specific therapy caused a lag in tumor growth corresponding to a 3-logarithm cell kill. Estimated tumor dose of radiation obtained by tissue analysis was 34 and 14 Gy for specific and nonspecific therapy, respectively. In conclusion, 120 microCi of 90Y-labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibodies was effective in suppressing growth of human colon cancer xenografts. Clinical studies with this preparation are recommended.\r"

Surgical results were excellent, postoperative courses were benign, and satisfactory palliation was provided. Improving morbidity and mortality with radical resection and aggressive radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery with the potential for bleeding from tumor necrosis make resection a reasonable alternative for palliation when localized but advanced disease exists.\r"

The risk of developing antepartum hypertension can now be assessed nonivasively by the midpoint of pregnancy. However, maternal hypertension is not always associated with a clinically important adverse outcome for either mother or infant. The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether increasing risk of antepartum hypertension is associated with increasing rates of clinically important maternal and/or infant morbidity. We assembled a prospective cohort of 720 women with singleton pregnancies. The proportion of pregnancies complicated by both antepartum hypertension and maternal and/or infant morbidity increased significantly between low, moderate, and high risk groups (0.2, 6 and 58.8%, respectively, p less than 0.0001). We conclude that a trial of primary prevention of hypertension in pregnancy should include a measure of significant morbidity in mother and infant.\r"

Intraosseous lines provide a timely noncollapsable route to the circulation in medical or traumatic emergencies when intravenous access is not possible. There has been no controlled study comparing intravenous and intraosseous loading of phenytoin. A 15 mg/kg dose of phenytoin was administered over 15 minutes to pigs by either the intravenous (n = 6) or tibial intraosseous route (n = 6). Femoral artery blood samples were drawn every 5 minutes for 35 minutes after initiation of infusion to determine phenytoin levels. There was no statistical difference between the two groups using analysis of variance repeated measures (P = .160). Microscopic examination of the cortex and marrow at the intraosseous site in these pigs was normal 5 weeks postinfusion. The authors conclude that the intraosseous route is an effective alternative to intravenous loading of phenytoin without permanent damage to the marrow.\r"

Specifically, 30 to 63 kg ruminants with an obstructed upper airway were resuscitated for 30 minutes from a hypoxic, hypercarbic, and acidotic state using 12- and 14-gauge catheters connected to a 50 psi oxygen source via a two-way valve with an I:E of 1:4 and 1:9 seconds, respectively.

Current Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines suggest that administering a bolus of flush solution after injection of medication may hasten drug delivery, but there is little evidence to support this. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of peripheral bolus injection on circulation times during cardiac arrest. Measurements of circulation times were made following injection of indocyanine green dye both with and without a bolus of 20 mL saline flush into a peripheral vein of mongrel dogs. There was no difference in systolic, diastolic, or coronary perfusion pressures during the injections with or without bolus injection. Similarly, there was no difference in end-tidal CO2 or in arterial-venous PO2, PCO2, or pH gradient. The circulation time without bolus injection was 77.7 +/- 42.7 seconds while circulation time with the saline flush was 48.3 +/- 20.9 seconds (P less than .001). Peak dye concentration without saline flush was 3.0 +/- 1.0 mg/L, and peak dye concentration with saline flush was 3.8 +/- 0.9 mg/L (P less than .001). We conclude that a bolus injection of 20 mL of saline enhances dye circulation times and peak levels during cardiac arrest in this animal model. The clinical application of this technique warrants further investigation.\r"

Thirteen years of statistics from our emergency department were used to examine the performance of the two formulas in predicting changes in the amount of physician services. The LIVES formula performed better than the volume formula: a better fit with number of physicians used by chi 2 analysis (chi 2 = 1084 versus 5591), a better correlation with physicians used (regression coefficient 0.98 v 0.21), a higher degree of association with physicians used (correlation coefficient 0.96 versus 0.53 with P less than 0.0001 v 0.06 by Student's t-test), and explained more of the variability in the amount of physicians used (92% v 28%).

  ".W": "The authors have reviewed our experience with 37 cases of toddler's fracture. This fracture of the distal tibia occurs in 1 to 4 year-old-children. History of trauma is usually trivial and the physical findings and radiological appearance are often subtle. The latter consists of a faint oblique lucent line crossing the distal tibia and terminating medially. It is usually seen on the anteroposterior view, poorly seen on the lateral and well seen on the internal oblique. Initial radiographs may be normal. A similar fracture of the midshaft of the tibia was associated with child abuse. Treatment consists of immobilization for a few weeks to protect the limb and to relieve pain. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is important because it obviates the need for investigations to rule out more sinister etiologies such as tumor or infection. The finding of a midshaft tibial fracture may indicate child abuse.\r"

This article presents a series in which 9 of 10 such spiral fractures were most likely the result of an accident and not child abuse or gross neglect. Additionally, almost all of these fractures presented as a gait disturbance and should be included in the differential of this complaint.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical activity and soreness in the quadriceps muscles were examined during a 48-h period after eccentric (EC) and concentric contraction (CC) to study the amplitude and frequency characteristics of the electrical signal after exercise and to study the relationship between the electrical signal and muscle soreness. The exercise protocol included a step test performed for 15 min using a 46-cm step in which one quadriceps contracted eccentrically and one contracted concentrically. Electrical activity was quantified by computing both root mean square electromyograph (rmsEMG) and mean power frequency of the myoelectrical signal during low-level contractions of the muscles. Recordings of muscle activity were made before exercise, immediately after exercise, 1, 12, 24 and 48 h after exercise in 12 volunteer subjects (mean age 28.5 yr). Recordings were made with the subject seated, holding the leg being tested slightly off the ground. Subjects were given a subjective pain rating scale. The before exercise values for rmsEMG (EC = 13.3 microV; CC = 13 microV) and mean power frequency (EC = 55.3 Hz; CC = 54.4 Hz) were within the range that would be expected for surface electrodes. The mean rating of soreness for the eccentrically exercised muscles ranged from slightly uncomfortable at 12 h after exercise to sore during the period 24-48 h after exercise. Subjects reported the concentrically exercised muscles as normal to slightly uncomfortable during the whole recording period. Analysis of variance revealed a significant (P less than 0.05) difference between EC and CC rmsEMG value at 1 h after exercise (EC = 17.2 +/- 7.6; CC = 12.3 +/- 5.5) and at 12 h after exercise (EC = 15.0 +/- 5.0; CC = 12.3 +/- 4.2). The results suggest that an increase in the electrical activity of muscles is needed to produce the same pre-exercise contraction after performing eccentric exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Variables pertaining to functional impairments, injury severity and institutional factors explained over 45% of the variance in discharge disposition. It appears that a good deal of rationality pervades the decision as to whether patients are discharged to home or to rehabilitation. The extent of functional impairments and the severity of injury are closely related to these discharge decisions, as one would expect in a well-functioning discharge planning system. However, there are indications that discharge decisions are also affected by factors that ideally should be external to the decision process. Chief among these is whether or not the trauma center has an onsite rehabilitation unit. Patients treated at trauma centers that have onsite rehabilitation units are significantly more likely to be discharged to rehabilitation than patients treated at trauma centers without onsite rehabilitation.\r"

In 1989, 232 field investigator-initiated research applications were received in response to the Federal Register announcement of September 8, 1988. Of these, 57 or 24.5% were assigned to the Medical Sciences Programs office. Six applications were ultimately approved and funded (10.7%). The remaining 51 (89.5%) were statistically analyzed to determine deficiencies significant in warranting disapproval. The 51 applications averaged 5.68 deficiencies each. Five types of research error accounted for 76.8% of all deficiencies noted by reviewers. These included methodologic errors (25) and inadequate control of subject variables (25), followed by inappropriate research design (24), poor conceptualization of problem/approach (21) and incorrect statistical analysis (14). The top ranked singular deficiency was poor conceptualization of problems or approach. Other flaws warranting lowering of potential scores by reviewers included excessive budget requests, duplication of effort with on-going supported research, inadequate background of investigator and weak dissemination and utilization plans. In conclusion, many applications are submitted for the NIDRR field investigator-initiated research program competitions that are significantly deficient. Those identified areas of deficiency cover most oF the conceptualization, research design and methodologic criteria essential for valid, creditable scientific investigation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The H reflex plays an important role in electrodiagnosis, but it does not give specific information about any particular segment of its long conduction pathway. Direct stimulation at the S1 spinal nerve might provide more complete information by dividing the H reflex pathway into its peripheral and spinal conduction portions. Patients with electromyographic evidence of S1 radiculopathy (n = 77) and normal control subjects (n = 56) were evaluated. Standard H reflex conduction studies were followed by monopolar needle stimulation of the first sacral spinal nerve. The ratio of the spinal nerve latency to the H reflex latency (S1 ratio) was calculated. The abnormal S1 ratio seen in 77% of the subjects suggested relative slowing within the spinal segment of the nerve. The remainder of the subjects with S1 radiculopathy had slowed conduction also affecting the peripheral segment that could have been caused by Wallerian degeneration. The S1 ratio can provide evidence that H reflex conduction slowing is the result of injury involving the intraspinal nerves. This technique should be especially useful in cases of acute lumbosacral injury when needle electromyographic study is often nondiagnostic.\r"

Sincere efforts yield a curvilinear relationship between grip force and handle position; feigned efforts yield a horizontal, linear relationship. The purpose of the present set of three experiments was to investigate the degree of control normal subjects have over submaximal effort and their ability to feign weakened grip. In Experiment 1 we found that subjects instructed to exert a specific amount of submaximal effort (50%) did not produce a response pattern of grip force consistent with Stokes' hypothesis. In Experiment 2 we found a linear relationship between the degree of submaximal effort and grip force for efforts of 30, 50, 70, and 90% of maximal effort. In Experiment 3 we found that subjects, with proper instruction as to the amount of effort to exert, can produce feigned submaximal efforts similar to the sincere, maximal efforts of injured people. Simple maximal grip force measurements are insensitive to the different motor strategies used in maximal and submaximal efforts and may provide little evidence for the detection of feigning.\r"

Data obtained revealed the coexistence of two distinct point mutations: a T to C change in codon 73 (arginine in place of a cysteine) and a C to T change in codon 53 (leucine in place of a proline). The second case was studied by hybridization with allele specific oligonucleotides and was found to be homozygous for the same mutation in codon 53.

RFLP-methylation analysis was performed on cell populations from bone marrow (BM) aspirates and peripheral blood using probes specific for the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene regions. Density gradient centrifugation methods were used to separate granulocytes and monocytes, and T lymphocytes were positively selected by CD2 (a pan-T marker) immunoconjugated magnetic beads. Cell populations from BM aspirates in 6 of the 7 patients with MDS showed a monoclonal pattern of X-inactivation. The neutrophilic and T-lymphocytic cell fractions were analyzed in 4 of the 6 patients, and the monocytic cell fraction in one of these, and all fractions analyzed showed a similar monoclonal pattern. In 2 of the latter 4 patients, both of whom had normal karyotypes, DNA from a skin biopsy showed a polyclonal pattern. Our data suggest that MDS is a clonal disorder, even in the absence of detectable cytogenetic abnormalities, and that the abnormal clone is capable of myeloid, monocytic, and lymphoid differentiation.\r"

In this study, primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) labeled with 35S-methionine were observed to synthesize Fn monomers both with and without this segment. Monomers isolated from cell lysates with antibodies to the ED1 sequence comigrated in nonreduced sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the slower (designated M1), but not the faster (designated M2), of two major monomeric populations that were recognized by antibodies raised to plasma-derived Fn. The differences between M1 and M2 were not due to glycosylation, since they were also observed between species of Fn monomer purified from cells grown in the presence of tunicamycin. M1 and M2 were both observed to incorporate with a similar rate into dimeric Fn, indicating that Fn monomers with and without the ED1 site can dimerize with similar efficiency. Analysis of reduced samples of Fn isolated from cells with anti-ED1 antibodies indicated the presence of both M1-M1 and M1-M2 dimers. In addition to being incorporated into extracellular matrix, ED1 + Fn was observed to be secreted in soluble form into the medium, potentially reflecting intravascular release of this protein by endothelial cells in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Male (NZW x BXSB) F1 (W/B F1) mice, which develop lupus nephritis, myocardial infarction, and thrombocytopenia, showed reduced platelet lifespan (PLS) and increased platelet-associated antibody (PAA) values. There were statistically significant correlations between the increase in PAA values and either the reduction in PLS or the decrease in platelet counts. This and the results of platelet transfer experiments between old male W/B F1 mice and either female W/B F1 or normal BALB/c mice indicate that PAAs on the platelet surface play a crucial role in the destruction of platelets in W/B F1 mice. The mechanism of thrombocytopenia observed here appears similar to that of human idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Therefore, we think that W/B F1 mice are a potentially useful animal model for investigating the effectiveness and mode of action of therapeutic agents in human ITP, and that they may provide additional information on the basic mechanisms of this autoimmune phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Rearrangement of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TcR) genes generally has been considered a useful marker of B- and T-cell lineage in lymphoproliferative disorders. However, concomitant rearrangements of Ig and TcR genes have been commonly reported in the most immature lymphoid malignancies, mainly in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To better characterize the nature of this lineage promiscuity, we have analyzed the configuration of the TcR delta locus in 75 B-precursor ALL. The large majority of cases (87%) displayed a rearrangement or deletion at the delta locus. Among the 57 nondeletional rearrangements, two patterns were predominant and both appeared to derive from partial joining: a V delta-(D)-D delta 3 (32/57) and a D delta 1/2-D delta 3 (11/57) type. A single V delta gene (V delta 2) appeared to be involved in the first type of rearrangement. These findings are at variance with T-ALL, where rearrangements 5' to V delta 2 are usually found. It remains to be elucidated whether this incomplete attempt of V delta 2 gene assembly is related to the neoplastic event or represents a physiologic predisposition occurring during early stages of the normal lymphocyte differentiation.\r"

The cytogenetic method used was a 24- to 48-hour culture, followed by G-banding. Several significant associations were discovered. A trisomy 3 was correlated with high-grade NHL. In the patients with an immunoblastic NHL, an abnormal chromosome no. 3 or 6 was found significantly more frequently. As previously described, a t(14;18) was significantly correlated with a follicular growth pattern. Abnormalities on chromosome no. 17 were correlated with a diffuse histology and a shorter survival. A shorter survival was also correlated with a +5, +6, +18, all abnormalities on chromosome no. 5, or involvement of breakpoint 14q11-12. In a multivariate analysis, these chromosomal abnormalities appeared to be independent prognostic factors and correlated with survival more strongly than any traditional prognostic variable. Patients with a t(11;14)(q13;q32) had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Skin infiltration was correlated with abnormalities on 2p. Abnormalities involving breakpoints 6q11-16 were correlated with B symptoms. Patients with abnormalities involving breakpoints 3q21-25 and 13q21-24 had more frequent bulky disease. The correlations of certain clinical findings with specific chromosomal abnormalities might help unveil the pathogenetic mechanisms of NHL and tailor treatment regimens.\r"

  ".W": "The blood kinetics and biodistribution of anti-common chronic lymphatic leukemia antigen (cCLLa) monoclonal antibody (MoAb) CLL2 were assessed in mice bearing cCLLa+ tumors. The cCLLa is a 69-Kd glycoprotein antigen expressed selectively by malignant B cells in human CLL, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and prolymphocytic leukemia. Immunoreactive 125I-CLL2 (5 micrograms/mouse, specific activity 4.3 microCi/micrograms) was injected intravenously in mice bearing HCL-derived EH xenografts, and blood kinetics and biodistribution were ascertained up to 16 days postinjection. Radioimages were also obtained up to 72 hours after injecting 10 micrograms/mouse (specific activity 50.1 microCi/micrograms) of 125I-CLL2. Distinct 125I-CLL2 blood kinetics were observed in EH engrafted compared with tumor-free mice including: a longer 125I-CLL2 T 1/2 (153 hours v 72 hours), and a considerably greater blood clearance (173 mg/h v 54.7 mg/h) with biexponential rather than monoexponential configuration; and a greater volume of antibody distribution (31,483 mg v 5,729 mg). These data suggest more rapid tissue uptake by grafted tumours. Preferential 125I-CLL2 uptake by EH tumours relative to normal tissues was observed beginning 24 hours postinjection (mean ratio, 4.2) with average peak tumor 125I-CLL2 levels of 428.7 pg/mg. 125I-CLL2 uptake selectivity by EH tumor cells was also supported by: (1) negligible 125I-CLL2 uptake by cCLLa- Molt-4 xenografts (average 29.1 pg/mg 24 hours postinjection); (2) background uptake of cCLLa-irrelevant MoAb 131I-LEU1 by CD5- EH xenografts (average 31.4 pg/mg 48 hours postinjection); and (3) by scintigraphy. The EH xenograft mouse model might be useful to ascertain preclinically the anti-tumor effect of anti-cCLLa MoAbs and of their conjugated derivatives.\r"

We investigated whether this stimulation is due to factors contained in the sera of the culture medium. Comparisons of gamma/gamma + beta biosynthetic ratios in erythroid colonies grown in fetal calf serum (FCS) or in charcoal treated FCS (C-FCS) showed that FCS-grown cells had significantly higher gamma/gamma + beta ratios. This increase in globin chain biosynthesis was reflected by an increase in relative amounts of steady-state gamma-globin mRNA. In contrast to its effect on adult cells, FCS failed to influence gamma-chain synthesis in fetal burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) colonies. There was a high correlation of gamma-globin expression in paired cultures done with C-FCS or fetal sheep serum. Dose-response experiments showed that the induction of gamma-globin expression is dependent on the concentration of FCS. These results indicate that FCS contains an activity that induces gamma-globin expression in adult erythroid progenitor cell cultures.\r"

Repeated phlebotomies were performed in 14 normal volunteer subjects to obtain varying degrees of iron deficiency. Serial measurements of serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, mean cell volume (MCV), free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP), red cell mean index, serum ferritin, and serum transferrin receptor were performed throughout the phlebotomy program. There was no change in receptor levels during the phase of storage iron depletion. When the serum ferritin level reached subnormal values there was an increase in serum receptor levels, which continued throughout the phlebotomy program. Functional iron deficiency was defined as a reduction in body iron beyond the point of depleted iron stores. The serum receptor level was a more sensitive and reliable guide to the degree of functional iron deficiency than either the FEP or MCV. Our studies indicate that the serum receptor measurement is of particular value in identifying mild iron deficiency of recent onset. The iron status of a population can be fully assessed by using serum ferritin as a measure of iron stores, serum receptor as a measure of mild tissue iron deficiency, and hemoglobin concentration as a measure of advanced iron deficiency.\r"

The beta chain of Hb Birmingham, found in an adult black man, is characterized by the loss of -Leu-Ala-His-Lys- at positions 141, 142, 143, and 144 and their replacement by one Gln residue. These changes are the result of a deletion of nine nucleotides, namely two base pairs (bp) of codon 141, all of codons 142 and 143, and one bp of codon 144; the remaining CAG triplet (C from codon 141 and AG from codon 144) codes for the inserted glutamine. In the beta chain of Hb Galicia from a Spanish patient, His and Val at positions 97 and 98 are replaced by one Leu residue. This is due to an ACG deletion in codons 97 and 98, which causes the removal of one His and one Val residue, while the remaining CTG triplet (C from codon 97 and TG from codon 98) codes for the inserted leucine residue. Two mechanisms, namely slipped mispairing in the presence of short repeats, and misreading by DNA polymerase due to a local distortion of the DNA helix, are considered in explaining the origin of the small deletions.\r"

Multivariate analysis identified positive pretransplant CMV serology as the only definable risk factor for CMV infection (relative risk 1.4, P less than .0001). CMV pneumonia developed in 11 patients at a median time of 100 days after transplant and was fatal in nine cases. CMV pneumonia was associated with significantly decreased probability of survival by day 100 after transplant (relative risk of death of 16.7, P less than .0001). In contrast to earlier reports, CMV infection had no significant effect on the rapidity of platelet or neutrophil recovery after transplant as assessed by time-dependent multivariate analysis. Because the incidence of severe CMV disease is not negligible after autologous marrow transplantation, preventive measures against CMV infection are warranted, as in allogeneic marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "90235325\r", 
  ".W": "The currently available automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has proven highly successful for termination of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Newer devices, however, permit lower energy shocks to be delivered initially and longer episodes of arrhythmia to occur before shocks are delivered. These changes may result in longer durations of arrhythmia before successful termination. Little is known about the effects of the duration of ventricular fibrillation on the efficacy of defibrillating shocks. In this study, we examined the efficacy of defibrillating shocks in 22 patients undergoing automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation or generator change. Defibrillating shocks ranging from 300 to 600 V (5.9-24.2 J) were delivered in matched pairs after 5 and 15 seconds of ventricular fibrillation. For the 300-V shocks (5.9 J), defibrillation was accomplished in 82% of patients when the shocks were given after 5 seconds of ventricular fibrillation and in only 45% of patients when the shocks were delivered after 15 seconds (p less than 0.01). At higher energies, there was no difference in the efficacy of defibrillation shocks delivered after 5 compared with 15 seconds of ventricular fibrillation. The postshock aortic, systolic, and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower when the shocks were given after 15 seconds of ventricular fibrillation than after only 5 seconds. We conclude that the duration of ventricular fibrillation affects defibrillation efficacy especially at energies that are relatively low compared with maximal device outputs and that longer episodes of ventricular fibrillation cause more postshock hemodynamic depression. These observations have implications for defibrillation threshold testing at the time of device implantation and for the design and programming of future automatic implantable antitachycardia devices.\r"

  ".U": "90235329\r", 
  ".W": "Although both transient entrainment and resetting with single extrastimuli have been demonstrated during sustained ventricular tachycardia related to previous myocardial infarction, the relation between these phenomena has not been defined. Because transient entrainment is only demonstrated when the mechanism of a tachycardia is reentry with an excitable gap, the resetting response to timed premature extrastimuli was studied in patients with ventricular tachycardia and correlated with the ability to demonstrate transient entrainment. The importance of the location of pacing and recording electrodes relative to regions of slow conduction within the reentry circuit for demonstrating specific characteristics of the resetting response after single extrastimuli was examined in 16 patients with 21 distinct morphologies of ventricular tachycardia related to coronary artery disease. At electrophysiological study, intracardiac electrograms were recorded simultaneously from four sites in the right ventricle and four sites in the left ventricle during ventricular tachycardia. Both resetting and transient entrainment could be demonstrated for 18 of the 21 (86%) ventricular tachycardias. The resetting response at each intracardiac recording site was defined as orthodromic or antidromic, based on the conduction time from the pacing stimulus to the recording site and the morphology of the captured (advanced) electrogram. An orthodromic resetting response was associated with demonstration of transient entrainment at 76 of 82 (93%) recording sites, implying that the pacing site was proximal and the recording site was distal to a region of slow conduction. In contrast, an antidromic resetting response was associated with transient entrainment at only six of 154 (4%) recording sites, suggesting that the pacing site was not separated from the recording site by a region of slow conduction (p = 0.001). The return cycle at the site of pacing exceeded the tachycardia cycle length in all episodes of ventricular tachycardia. At orthodromically activated recording sites, however, resetting was associated with a return cycle less than the tachycardia cycle length. Thus, orthodromic resetting demonstrates that a pause is not an integral part of the resetting response but that premature extrastimuli preexcite the reentrant circuit by entering the excitable gap, conducting through a region of slow conduction, and emerging distally without a change in activation sequence. In all episodes of ventricular tachycardia, the slope of the return cycle at the pacing site was determined by the conduction properties to the orthodromically activated sites, with increasing patterns (n = 6) produced by progressive conduction delay in the reentrant circuit at shorter coupling intervals and flat patterns (n = 3) produced by a constant orthodromic conduction interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The primary study design used a solution of a multivariate risk factor equation for death, by which survival rate under optimal conditions was predicted to be 92%, 89%, 88%, 86%, 81%, and 73% at 1 month, 6 months, and 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, after the Fontan operation. The hazard function (instantaneous risk of death at each moment in time after the operation) had an early rapidly declining phase of hazard that at about 6 months began to give way to a late hazard phase, which was rising by about 6 years after surgery. A secondary study design, using the theory of competing risks, yielded survival and hazard function information very similar to that of the primary study design. The functional capacity of the patients as expressed by New York Heart Association class was less, the longer the period of follow-up. No risk factors (other than older age at time of surgery) were found for the late decline in survival or the decline in functional status. The inference is that the premature decline in survival and functional status and the late rise in hazard function are from the Fontan state per se and that the Fontan operation is, therefore, palliative but not curative.\r"

We studied ventricular volume characteristics in 10 patients with double-inlet left ventricle before and after septation. Preoperative end-diastolic volume (EDV) of the ventricle was 291 +/- 111% (+/- SD) of normal and ejection fraction (EF) was 0.59 +/- 0.07. Postoperatively, EDV of the right-sided ventricle (RV) was 82 +/- 24%, and EDV of the left-sided ventricle (LV) was 153 +/- 41%. Ejection fraction of the RV was 0.77 +/- 0.10, and LVEF was 0.49 +/- 0.13. On the short-axis view of two-dimensional echocardiography, fractional change of the cross-sectional area was 0.65 +/- 0.16 for the RV and 0.23 +/- 0.11 for the LV. Fractional shortening of the septum-to-ventricular free wall axis was 0.51 +/- 0.17 in the RV and -0.05 +/- 0.09 in the LV. Analysis of the curvature of the new septum during cardiac cycle on two-dimensional echocardiography revealed that the septum shifted to the right side during systole in all patients in whom the systolic LV/RV pressure ratio was larger than 1.0. The septum shifted toward the LV during diastole in eight patients in whom end-diastolic pressure in the RV was higher than or equal to that in the LV, whereas it remained in the right side in two patients with higher left-side pressure. The cardiac index of these two patients was 2.4 and 2.6 l/min/m2, respectively, whereas it averaged 4.4 +/- 1.0 l/min/m2 in the other eight patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of relative exercise intensity on organ blood volume and its relation to cardiac function, changes in relative blood volume and cardiac function were monitored with radionuclide techniques in 14 healthy volunteers. After labeling the subject's red cells with technetium 99m, we acquired data at rest, zero-load cycling, and at 50%, 75%, and 100% of maximal oxygen uptake. From rest to zero-load cycling, leg blood volume decreased 32 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM), whereas relative end-diastolic blood volume increased 9.6 +/- 1.2%, and lung blood volume increased 18 +/- 2%, suggesting that the lungs may act as a blood volume buffer during periods of acutely increased venous return. With relative increasing exercise, leg blood volume stabilized, and then the blood volume in the abdominal organs decreased, further augmenting cardiopulmonary blood volume; leg blood volume and abdominal blood volume decreased by 23 +/- 2% and 19 +/- 2% from baseline, respectively, whereas thoracic blood volume increased 38 +/- 4%. In the abdomen, large decreases in blood volume were observed in the spleen (46 +/- 2%), kidney (24 +/- 4%), and liver (18 +/- 4%). In contrast, lung blood volume increased 50 +/- 4%, with the upper lung fields increasing more than the lower. Blood sampling revealed an increase in the hematocrit level by 4.3 +/- 0.4 units at peak exercise that paralleled the decrease in splenic blood volume (r2 = -0.64, p less than 0.001), suggesting a role for the spleen in augmenting cardiovascular performance by the release of concentrated red blood cells into general circulation. We conclude that upright exercise results in marked blood volume shifts from the legs and abdominal organs to the heart and lungs in a dynamic process correlating closely with oxygen consumption.\r"

Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar in black and white men, but the diastolic pressure was significantly higher in black than in white women (81.4 vs 77.4 mm Hg). Body weight was higher in black than in white women, and reported physical activity was higher in black than in white men. The proportion of smokers was somewhat higher in blacks than in whites. During the treadmill exercise test with a modified Bruce protocol, mean systolic blood pressure at stage 2 was 174 mm Hg in black men and 166 mm Hg in white men (p less than 0.02), but stage 2 blood pressures did not differ between black and white women (153 and 152 mm Hg, respectively). Even after adjustments were made for levels of baseline characteristics (age, weight, resting systolic blood pressure, smoking, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, physical activity, and alcohol intake), black men responded with a 7-mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure during exercise than white men (p less than 0.01). Another new finding was a highly significant positive association between stage 2 systolic blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in men. The findings suggest a higher systemic vascular resistance during exercise in the selected sample of black men, which is consistent with the higher incidence of hypertension in black men.\r"

Radioactivity was concentrated in the renal pelvis, heart, liver, spleen, salivary glands, and gall bladder. Uptake of 18F by the heart resulted in striking delineation of the left ventricular myocardium. Pretreatment with desipramine markedly decreased cardiac positron emission, consistent with dependence of the heart on neuronal uptake (uptake-1) for removal of circulating catecholamines. In reserpinized animals, cardiac positron emission was absent within 30 minutes after injection of [18F]-6-fluorodopamine, demonstrating that the emission in untreated animals was from radioactive labeling of the sympathetic storage vesicles. Decreased positron emission from denervated salivary glands confirmed that the tracer was concentrated in sympathetic neurons. Radioactivity in the gall bladder and urinary system depicted the hepatic and renal excretion of the tracer and its metabolites. Administration of tyramine or nitroprusside increased and ganglionic blockade with trimethaphan decreased the rate of loss of myocardial radioactivity. The results show that PET scanning after administration of [18F]fluorodopamine can be used to visualize sites of sympathetic innervation, follow the metabolism and renal and hepatic excretion of catecholamines, and examine cardiac sympathetic function.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis tested in this study was that despite the presence of severe postischemic myocardial dysfunction (\"stunning\"), the extraction and subsequent intracellular washout of thallium 201 should be preserved as long as irreversible sarcolemmal membrane injury was avoided. To produce myocardial stunning, 19 open-chested dogs with a critical left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenosis underwent 10 5-minute periods of total LAD occlusion, each interspersed by 10 minutes of reperfusion by reflow through the critical stenosis. In another 12 control dogs observed for the same time period, no LAD occlusions were performed after placement of the critical stenosis. Hemodynamics, regional myocardial thickening by quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography, and microsphere-determined regional blood flows were serially measured. In 18 stunned dogs, systolic thickening in the LAD zone was markedly reduced to 0.4 +/- 2.4% at 40 minutes after the 10th reperfusion period compared with 32.5 +/- 2.2% thickening (p less than 0.001) in 12 control dogs at a matched time. The 201Tl first-pass extraction fraction determined by a double-isotope method using intracoronary 201Tl administration was comparable after the 10th reflow in a subgroup of 13 stunned (0.78) and six control (0.79) dogs. The T1/2 for the intracellular washout rate was also not significantly different in another group of six stunned (60 +/- 13 minutes) and six control (53 +/- 14 minutes) dogs, nor was the percentage of the 201Tl dose initially distributed in the interstitial compartment (11 +/- 3% vs. 7 +/- 2%). Systemic hemodynamics and regional flows were comparable in the two groups at 40 minutes after the 10th reflow. No dog had evidence of myocardial necrosis by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Thus, normal myocardial 201Tl extraction and washout kinetics are observed in a canine model of severe postischemic dysfunction (stunning) produced by repetitive brief LAD occlusions. These findings might have important clinical implications concerning the application of rest 201Tl scintigraphy for evaluation of perfusion and viability in patients with coronary artery disease and regional myocardial asynergy that is ultimately reversible.\r"

  ".U": "90235341\r", 
  ".W": "By using a Langendorff-perfused ring of anisotropic rabbit epicardium, sustained reentrant ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 168 +/- 13 msec (n = 26) was induced by programmed electrical stimulation. Continuous left ventricular epicardial mapping with 256 simultaneously recorded unipolar electrograms demonstrated that the tachycardia was based on circuital movement of the impulse around a fixed obstacle. Because of the anisotropic properties of the myocardium, the circuit consisted of a ring with segments in which the circulating wave propagated slowly (20 +/- 2 cm/sec) or faster (62 +/- 4 cm/sec). This was related to transverse or longitudinal propagation in relation to fiber direction. In six of 26 experiments, sudden acceleration in rate of the tachycardia was observed during programmed electrical stimulation. This acceleration was caused by the occurrence of double-wave reentry (two successive waves traveling in the same direction and using the same circuit). In one of the experiments, induction of double-wave reentry was only possible at basal conditions but not after the administration of a class III antiarrhythmic drug. In a seventh experiment, induction of double-wave reentry became possible after the administration of a class IC antiarrhythmic drug. Because conduction velocity around the ring was depressed during acceleration, the total revolution time of the circuit during double-wave reentry was about 120% of that during single-wave reentry. Ventricular tachycardias in which double-wave reentry could be elicited had longer cycle lengths (197 +/- 11 vs. 156 +/- 8 msec, p less than 0.001) and larger excitable gaps (71 +/- 16 vs. 28 +/- 5 msec, p less than 0.001) than those not showing this phenomenon. Double-wave reentry might have important clinical implications in understanding ventricular tachycardia acceleration during programmed electrical stimulation, proarrhythmic effects of drugs, and pathophysiology of rapid ventricular tachycardias.\r"

  ".W": "Tolerance of the canine heart to prolonged ischemic arrest was studied in 10 hearts from normal control dogs and 15 hearts from dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); experiments were performed 1 year after banding the aorta in 8-week-old puppies. At 1 year, hemodynamic studies revealed decreased left ventricular (LV) fiber shortening and elevated end-diastolic pressure (EDP) in five dogs (group with LVH failure); 10 dogs exhibited normal shortening and normal EDP (group with LVH compensation). The left ventricle-to-body weight ratio (g/kg) was 4.4 +/- 0.8 in the control group of dogs, 7.7 +/- 1.0 in the group with LVH compensation, and 10 +/- 2.5 in the group with LVH failure. The tolerance to 60 minutes of global ischemia (37 degrees C) followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion was studied in an isolated blood-perfused heart apparatus (isovolumic left ventricle, coronary perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg). In the baseline (preischemic) state, coronary blood flow, myocardial oxygen consumption, lactate extraction, and myocardial high-energy phosphate content were essentially equal in the three groups; with LV volume adjusted to produce a systolic pressure of 100 mm Hg, there were no significant differences in LVEDP among the three groups. During ischemia, the diastolic (asystolic) pressure increased from 11 +/- 3 to 28 +/- 16 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) in the group with LVH failure; however, it did not increase in the control or the LVH compensation groups. Myocardial ATP levels declined equally in all three groups. During early reperfusion, lactate washout was lowest in the group with LVH failure. By 90 minutes of reperfusion, there were no significant differences in coronary blood flow, myocardial oxygen consumption, lactate extraction, or high-energy phosphate levels. High diastolic pressure persisted at 90 minutes of reperfusion in the LVH failure group (EDP was 34 +/- 19 mm Hg); however, there was no significant change in EDP during reperfusion in the control or with LVH compensation groups. After 90 minutes of reperfusion, developed pressures in the control (54 +/- 9 mm Hg), the LVH compensation (49 +/- 18 mm Hg), and the LVH failure (67 +/- 17 mm Hg) groups were not significantly different. These data indicate that hearts with compensated LVH do not exhibit an impaired tolerance to ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Among the possibilities are that estrogen replacement therapy may 1) inhibit growth of atherosclerotic plaque and 2) decrease the prevalence of transient myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction by modulating vasomotion in atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Using quantitative coronary angiography, we determined vasomotor responses of atherosclerotic coronary arteries in ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys; six were given physiological estrogen \"replacement\" by subcutaneous implants, and six were not. Intracoronary infusion of the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine (1 X 10(-6) M) caused paradoxical constriction of coronary arteries (from 1.2 +/- 0.2 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm, p less than 0.05) in the estrogen-deficient monkeys. However, acetylcholine tended to minimally dilate the left circumflex coronary artery in estrogen-treated monkeys (from 1.2 +/- 0.2 to 1.5 +/- 0.2 mm, p greater than 0.2). Although estrogen replacement therapy reduced plaque extent in coronary arteries, altered vasomotion was not related to plaque extent. We conclude that estrogen modulates vasomotion of atherosclerotic coronary arteries of monkeys and speculate that estrogen-modulated constrictor responses of atherosclerotic coronary arteries may reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women.\r"

  ".U": "90235347\r", 
  ".W": "A consistent pattern of intraventricular regional pressure gradients exists under physiological conditions during the rapid filling phase of diastole in the normal dog left ventricle. We hypothesized that this pressure gradient pattern is caused, in part, by early diastolic recoil of the left ventricular walls in conjunction with release of elastic potential energy stored during systole, generating suction and thus contributing to diastolic filling. If so, any condition that interferes with normal regional systolic function might be expected to modify the pattern of the normal early diastolic intraventricular pressure gradients. Accordingly, the present study was designed to determine whether acutely induced regional systolic left ventricular mechanical dysfunction is accompanied by changes in the pattern of the early diastolic intraventricular pressure gradients. Acute myocardial ischemia was induced by balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in nine anesthetized closed-chest dogs. The maximum early diastolic intraventricular pressure gradient (MIVP) was measured between the mid-left ventricle and apex with a dual-sensor micromanometer (3-cm spacing between the sensors) before and 20 minutes after LAD occlusion. Ejection fraction (EF) and number of dyskinetic chords (DChords) were measured from left ventricular contrast ventriculograms. Twenty minutes after LAD occlusion, the nine dogs evidenced significant changes in EF (56 +/- 10% to 37 +/- 8%), DChords (0 +/- 0 to 17 +/- 16 chords), left ventricular minimum pressure (-1.7 +/- 0.5 to 0.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (4.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.9 +/- 2.2 mm Hg), and heart rate (90 +/- 17 to 103 +/- 18 beats/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We stained the biopsies for myosin ATPase and measured the proportions and diameters of the type 1 and type 2 fibers. There were more qualitative changes in the external intercostal muscles than in the other two, and some of these changes related to the incidence of malignancy. There were more type 1 fibers in the external intercostal (64 +/- 10 percent) and internal intercostal muscles (59 +/- 12 percent) than in the latissimus dorsi (44 +/- 13 percent) (p less than 0.005). The mean diameter of the type 2 fibers in the external intercostal muscles was less (44 mu +/- 7 mu) than the diameter in the latissimus dorsi (51 mu +/- 9 mu) and the internal intercostal muscles (52 mu +/- 8 mu) (p less than 0.01). The diameters of both fiber types were greater in men than in women. There was no significant relationship between measures of pulmonary function or respiratory muscle strength and muscle fiber proportions and diameters. There were significant correlations between the percentage of ideal body weight and type 1 and type 2 fiber diameters. We conclude that sex and nutrition influence respiratory muscle morphometry.\r"

The first group includes patients with T1, T2, or T3 primary tumors and regional lymph node metastases confined to the ipsilateral mediastinal and subcarinal lymph nodes (N2 disease). There is controversy over the selection of this group of patients for surgery; some physicians do not believe that resection is an option if there is any evidence of mediastinal lymph node involvement. The second group is composed of patients with limited, circumscribed extrapulmonary extension of the primary tumor and lymph node metastasis, if present, limited to the hilar and peribronchial nodes (T3 N0-1 M0 disease). Peripheral tumors invading the chest wall, tumors originating in the superior sulcus of the lung, and those with limited involvement of the pericardium or the main bronchus are included. A five-year cumulative survival rate of 28 percent was documented for 198 consecutive patients undergoing complete resection for stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer, 21 percent for the T1-3 N2 group, and 39 percent for the T3 N0-N1 patients. Cell type was not a statistically significant variable for survival; however, a superior outcome was observed for patients with squamous cell carcinoma in every TNM category. The results support surgical treatment as a valid option for selected patients with extrapulmonary extension of the disease.\r"

Nodal metastases to the lower mediastinum from upper lobe cancer were frequently observed as were metastases of lower lobe cancer to the upper mediastinum. The frequency of the latter was higher than that of the former. About one third of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe produced nodal metastases in the lower mediastinum. In addition, there were often skip metastases to the nonregional parts of the mediastinum without regional nodal involvement in the mediastinum. From the results of the present study, it appears that extensive mediastinal dissection should be recommended in surgery for lung cancer irrespective of the location of the primary tumor.\r"

Opportunistic organisms such as Pneumocystis carinii were not found in any of the 35 BAL fluids sent for special stains and cultures. Three of 16 (18 percent) BAL fluids sent for HIV culture were positive compared with a 60.9 percent blood HIV culture positivity in the same group. To evaluate cellular recovery, the patients were divided into Walter Reed (WR) groups 1 and 2 (blood CD4 greater than or equal to 400/cu mm) and WR3 to WR5 (blood CD4 less than 400/cu mm). Compared with ten nonsmoking healthy controls, the WR1 and WR2 group had a greater overall cellular recovery but this was not statistically significant when the smokers were excluded. There was no difference in macrophage or lymphocyte percentages in either patient group compared with controls. T-cell subset analysis of a small group of WR1 to WR5 patient BAL fluids revealed no difference in CD4 numbers or the CD4/CD8 rate between WR1 and WR2 and WR3 to WR5 patients. We conclude that opportunistic pulmonary infection is unlikely in HIV-seropositive patients with normal chest roentgenograms despite symptoms of dyspnea on exertion. Also, HIV can be isolated from BAL fluid from these patients although not as often as from blood. Finally, there appears to be no distinct progression in BAL cellular findings before the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

We measured resting minute ventilation, the 15-s MVV, FEV1 and ABG values in 13 patients with exacerbation of COPD in the ER and 11 stable subjects with similar degrees of COPD. We tested if measures of VR could distinguish between ER patients progressing to respiratory failure, ER patients who avoided progression to respiratory failure and stable patients. There were significant differences in measures of the mean VR between various groups of patients. We conclude that in this COPD population, VR can be accurately predicted in the ER and that it may be a clinically valid predictor of patient outcomes.\r"

Ventricular arrhythmias were detected on a 24-h ECG recorded at the beginning of the observation period and after a stable improvement of RF. Left ventricular function was evaluated by equilibrium-gated radionuclide angiocardiography measuring LVEF, PER and PFR. We found a significant decrease in the arrhythmia score after improvement of RF; LVEF and PFR were slightly depressed in six and nine patients, respectively. A \"step-up\" multiple regression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between PFR and ventricular arrhythmias during worsened RF, whereas LVEF, arterial blood gases and clinical data were not significantly predictive variables. Thus, a depressed left ventricular diastolic performance seems to be a predictive factor for arrhythmias during RF from COPD. The poor definition of the statistical model suggests that other presently unknown factors contribute to the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

In addition, platelet catecholamines were determined as they fluctuate more slowly than plasma catecholamines. After infarction initial platelet epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were higher (p less than 0.05 for both) in nonsurvivors than survivors during a one year follow-up. Results suggested that activation of the sympathoadrenal system influences calcium homeostasis following AMI, but that the impact of sympathoadrenal activation on mineral metabolism is of minor clinical significance in the average AMI patient. High platelet catecholamine levels may predict a poor outcome after AMI.\r"

These patients were studied before and after (POD1,3) elective cholecystectomy. In preoperative studies, DB increased the supine value of Vab. The corresponding increase on POD1 represents a similar proportion of the resting value. The postoperative fall in resting and stimulated values of Vab is attributed to the known effects of abdominal surgery on diaphragmatic movement. Hence, DB warrants investigation as a method of prophylaxis against the pulmonary complications of surgery, because diaphragmatic movement is largely responsible for ventilation of the lower lung fields, where atelectasis and infection occur most often.\r"

Deposition was measured as concentration difference of five size fractions in inhaled and exhaled air using an electrical aerosol analyzer. The data showed that deposition of these ultrafine particles was increased in subjects with obstructive lung disease when compared with normal subjects, while it was unchanged in subjects with restrictive lung disease. The increase in deposition in the subjects with obstructive lung disease was significant for particle sizes 0.04 to 0.24 micron. Possible mechanisms for increased deposition in airway obstruction include increased transit time of particles, abnormal expiratory collapse of airways due to flow limitation, and flow perturbations resulting from decreased airway caliber.\r"

Patients were ventilated with one-lung anesthesia and administration of 100 percent oxygen. With infusion of dobutamine, the heart rate, cardiac index, and LVSWI significantly increased. Mean arterial pressure increased while PAP fell. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance also declined. Arterial oxygenization and delivery improved, while oxygen uptake was unchanged. Pulmonary shunt fraction was significantly reduced. While the mechanism for shunt reduction in our patients is unclear, operative factors may include pulmonary vasodilation with dobutamine inhibition of HPV. The negative impact of reduced HPV may have been lessened by gravitational distribution of blood flow and dobutamine-mediated reduction in PAP in our patients.\r"

None of the models previously described for use in coronary artery surgery has been tested with a prospective patient series that confirms the true predictive capacity of the model. Ideally, the predictive ability of such models should be validated with prospective trials. To examine the feasibility of statistical modeling in this clinical context, a computerized model based on the theorem of Bayes was developed to predict operative mortality for urgent coronary artery surgery. The presence or absence of 20 risk factors was determined for each of 405 consecutive patients undergoing urgent coronary artery surgery from January 1984 to January 1989. The first 100 patients were used to develop a database for the model, which was then used to prospectively evaluate the remaining 305 patients. There was good agreement between predicted and observed results. Models of this kind are particularly advantageous because of the ability to (1) accommodate multiple risk factors, (2) become tailored to a specific practice, and (3) determine individual rather than group prognosis. Validation with a prospective trial confirms the practical utility of this approach. This model has reliably predicted the risk associated with urgent coronary artery surgery and may provide important clinical information for the management of patients being evaluated for urgent revascularization.\r"

The effects of inhalation of 0.2 mg of fenoterol and 0.02 mg of ipratropium bromide on the impedance of the respiratory system was studied in 20 healthy subjects in a frequency spectrum between 4 and 52 Hz. Both agents caused a statistically significant decrease in resistance (Rrs). Inhalation of fenoterol and ipratropium bromide caused a significant increase in reactance (Xrs). The decrease in Rrs was greater after inhalation of fenoterol than after ipratropium bromide. Fenoterol and ipratropium bromide caused qualitatively similar changes in Rrs and Xrs of the respiratory system. The changes in Rrs can be explained by dilation of the central airways. The changes in Xrs are supposed to be the result of an increase in the capacitance of the lungs.\r"

There were significantly elevated soluble IL-2R values in tuberculous pleural fluid as compared with pleural fluid of nontuberculous etiology including malignant, bacterial and transudative pleural effusions. In patients with tuberculous pleurisy, the level of soluble IL-2R in pleural fluid was markedly greater than that in serum. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was observed between soluble IL-2R levels and adenosine deaminase levels in tuberculous pleural fluid. These findings suggest that elevated levels of pleural fluid soluble IL-2R in tuberculous pleurisy could reflect the local proliferation of activated T-cells and may be clinically useful in the diagnostic procedures for patients with pleural tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "A modified indicator gas washout method was developed to measure functional residual capacity (FRC) during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) without interruption of HFOV. A hot-wire flowmeter and medical gas analyzer measured the flow rate and argon concentration, respectively, at the expiratory end of the respiratory circuit. Upstream of the hot-wire flowmeter, two heat-and-moisture exchangers for resistance and a rubber balloon for capacitance were placed to convert the oscillating expiratory flow to an almost continuous flow. This made it possible to measure FRC during HFOV without interrupting HFOV. To measure the volume of the entire respiratory circuit, a 10 percent argon in 90 percent oxygen gas mixture was initially used as a bias flow, and after equilibration, the test gas was switched to 100 percent oxygen. By electrical integration of the product of the expiratory flow rate and argon concentration, the total amount of argon equilibrated in the entire respiratory circuit was calculated. The volume of the circuit was calculated by dividing the total amount of argon by the initial argon concentration. Functional residual capacity plus the volume of the respiratory circuit was similarly calculated and the difference was estimated as FRC. The accuracy and reproducibility of our method were evaluated by using a one-compartment lung model. There was a high correlation between the volume setting of the model lung and the estimated FRC. This method can be used to estimate FRC in a one-compartment lung model during HFOV, and it is potentially useful in clinical situations.\r"

We studied 13 patients with kyposcoliosis; their mean (+/- SD) age was 24.7 +/- 2.1 years; eight underwent anterior and posterior spinal fusions (AF and PF, respectively) two weeks apart (group A), four underwent PF alone (group B), and one had a three-stage procedure. Mean total respiratory elastance (Ers), static and dynamic lung elastance (Est,L and Edyn,L, respectively), chest wall elastance (Ew), and lung resistance (RL) were derived according to previously described methodology. In group A, Ers and Ew increased by 39 percent and 58 percent, respectively, following AF and by 20 percent and 129 percent following PF, while Est,L and Edyn,L did not change or declined following PF. Lung resistance increased 19 percent and 41 percent by the end of AF and PF, respectively, in group A. In group B, Ew more than doubled, resulting in a 39 percent increase in Ers. Increases in Ers, Ew, and respiratory flow resistance observed at the time of spinal corrective surgery for kyphoscoliosis may result from rib cage trauma and changes in airway caliber related to microatelectasis and uneven distribution of mechanical properties within the lungs. Spinal correction results in immediate and short-term deterioration of respiratory mechanics measured under anesthesia.\r"

Contrast-enhanced (CE) echocardiography provides a noninvasive method to detect right-to-left shunting associated with IPVD. We prospectively studied 40 consecutive liver transplant candidates to determine the relationship between CE echocardiography, arterial blood gases, and standard pulmonary function tests. Two patients had technically unacceptable results of echocardiographic studies. Thirty-eight patients had acceptable results of studies; seven (18.4 percent) of 38 were hypoxemic (PaO2 less than 70 mm Hg). Thirty-one patients (81.6 percent) had PaO2 greater than or equal to 70 mm Hg. Positive CE echocardiograms suggesting IPVD were found in five (13.2 percent) of 38. Three (9.7 percent) of the 31 patients with PaO2 greater than or equal to 70 mm Hg had positive CE echocardiograms. Two (28.6 percent) of the seven hypoxemic patients had positive CE echocardiography. Mean PaO2 and pulmonary function parameters were not significantly different between those with positive CE echocardiogram compared with those with normal CE echocardiograms. We conclude that for our group of liver transplant candidates, (1) IPVD as suggested by CE echocardiography were not uncommon (13.2 percent), and (2) positive CE echocardiography could be documented in patients who were not hypoxemic (9.7 percent).\r"

To evaluate, prospectively and retrospectively, the attitudes of employees, staff physicians, and patients of a medical institution, a questionnaire was administered before and after implementation of a no-smoking policy. Of many questions, select ones reviewed here focused on the following concerns: (1) how tobacco smoke affects employees and patients, (2) employee acceptance of a no-smoking policy before and after its implementation, and (3) the consequences of the policy on employee smokers. Open-ended questions about smoking were constructed by a committee comprised of clinicians, investigators, and administrators. The questionnaire was given to 2,000 randomly selected patients and the institution's entire staff of 4,200 employees and 225 staff physicians. Data were obtained on three occasions: six months before, six months after, and one year after the implementation of the no-smoking policy. The majority of patients, employees, and physicians indicated that the smoke of others bothered them and ranked the following as most offensive: smell, eye irritation, provocation of sinus problems, coughing, and headache. Approximately 80 percent of employees and patients favored the policy before its inception; and employees increasingly favored it through the year after its implementation with a favorable attitude increasing by nearly 10 percentage points. One year after implementation, 80 percent of patients were in favor of the policy. In the final survey, 74 percent of respondents indicated the policy had helped them. One year after policy implementation, employee smoking was reduced significantly from 22 to 14 percent; and of those employees who continued to smoke, 81 percent smoked less than eight cigarettes per day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Chest radiograph and pulmonary function evaluation, including lung volumes, diffusing capacity and arterial blood gases, were within normal limits. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed Pneumocystis carinii organisms. In this asymptomatic, HIV-positive patient, active alveolar infection, evidenced by abnormal gallium-67 scanning, predated pulmonary physiologic abnormalities. This observation raises questions concerning the natural history of this disease process and the specificity of physiologic tests for excluding disease. It also has implications for the treatment of neoplasia in the HIV-positive patient population.\r"

After infusion of 2.5-5.0 mg hematoporphyrin derivative/kg of body weight, lesions were photoradiated using an argon dye laser with power set at 300-400 mW for 5 min/site. During a follow-up period averaging 14.5 months (range 1-33 months), complete local tumor destruction and negative histology were observed in 24 of 54 cases. The mean recurrence-free period varied from 13.8 to 17.4 months according to groups. Fifteen patients remain alive and disease-free. The results of this open pilot study suggest the potential efficacy of photodynamic therapy as curative treatment for selected cases of inoperable gastrointestinal cancers, possibly in association with locoregional radiotherapy.\r"

Combined pH-metries in antrum and corpus were performed in each volunteer on four occasions. In a randomized study design, antacid or placebo were given 1 hr after either a protein or a carbohydrate pancake, of which only the former had any acid-buffering capacity. Before the meal, pH was higher in the antrum than in the corpus (median antrum: 3.2, corpus 1.5). In the corpus, a protein pancake but not a carbohydrate pancake raised the pH (median pH after protein pancake: 3.5; after carbohydrate pancake: 1.4). In the antrum, the protein pancake had no effect, but the carbohydrate pancake decreased the pH (median pH after protein pancake: 3.1; after carbohydrate pancake: 2.0). The antacid had no effect in the corpus after either pancake. It raised intraluminal pH markedly in the antrum after a carbohydrate pancake (median antral pH before antacid: 2.0; after antacid: 3.3), whereas its effect in the antrum was weak after a protein pancake. In vitro experiments were conducted to explain the in vivo results: in contrast to a carbohydrate pancake, a protein pancake reduced the buffering capacity of the antacid by direct interaction. In conclusion, the effect of an antacid gel on intragastric pH is predominantly localized in the antrum and is attenuated in the presence of proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When given either intragastrically or intraperitoneally, zinc L-carnosine (10 or 30 mg/kg) prevented gross visible damage to gastric mucosa caused by ethanol without affecting the mucosal prostaglandin E2 level. This protective effect of zinc L-carnosine was not inhibited by indomethacin. Histological assessment showed that zinc L-carnosine inhibited deep mucosal necrosis, as did 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. Zinc L-carnosine (10(-6) or 10(-5) M) inhibited the damage caused by ethanol to gastric cells isolated from rat gastric mucosa in vitro; this effect was not inhibited by indomethacin. The results suggested that zinc L-carnosine protects the gastric mucosa and enhances cellular resistance to ethanol without the mediation of endogenous prostaglandins.\r"

Each spike burst corresponds to a peristaltic SO contraction. Two types of animal preparations were evaluated: (1) awake chronic animal preparations and (2) anesthetized animals. A total of 19 chronic animals were prepared by implantation of electrodes on the SO, gastric antrum, duodenum, and jejunum. SO spike-burst rate was stimulated by intravenous infusion of CCK-OP (10 ng/kg/min), feeding, or intraduodenal infusion of fat-containing nutrient. Each stimulus was begun 20 min after cessation of phase III duodenal MMC activity and caused an increase in SO spike-burst rate from about 2 to 6/min that lasted for less than or equal to 1 hr. Such increases were antagonized substantially by hexamethonium, atropine, or methysergide. The CCK antagonist, L364718, antagonized the excitatory SO response to CCK-OP infusion or intraduodenal infusion of fat-containing nutrient (Isocal) but did not antagonize the response to feeding; CR1409 had no antagonistic effect on SO response to any of the three types of stimuli. In the acute studies in anesthetized animals, an intravenous bolus dose of CCK-OP (800 ng/kg) caused a substantial increase in SO spike-burst rate that was antagonized by CR1409 but not by atropine, hexamethonium, methysergide, L364718, or TTX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Net proton permeability (Pnet), determined by acridine orange fluorescence quenching, was increased from 6.3 x 10(-4) cm/sec in untreated vesicles, by approximately 120, 150, and 170%, by treatment with bile salts at 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mM, respectively. The three bile salts were equipotent. The increases in membrane fragility and Pnet were not accompanied by significant increases in membrane fluidity, as assessed from steady-state and time-resolved diphenylhexatriene fluorescence anisotropy. The data demonstrate direct effects of bile salts on duodenal apical membrane fragility and proton permeability that are likely to be early events in bile salt-induced mucosal damage.\r"

In patients on parenteral nutrition, this amino acid-induced gastric acid secretion might contribute to the failure of H2-receptor antagonists to raise intragastric pH above 4.0, a level thought to be needed to prevent stress ulceration. Therefore we studied the effect of single and repeated doses of the H+/K(+)-ATPase blocker omeprazole on the intragastric pH during a 3-hr infusion of amino acids in 10 healthy volunteers; 5% glucose was used as a control infusion. Amino acids significantly decreased intragastric pH when compared to glucose infusion (P less than 0.05). After intravenous administration of 40 mg, 80 mg and 2 X 40 mg omeprazole, this amino acid-induced fall in pH was significantly inhibited (P less than 0.01). No advantage of the 80-mg dose over the 40-mg dose could be demonstrated. The repeated dose of 40 mg showed a tendency to higher pH values compared to the single-dose experiments, which reached significance in the amino acid experiments only (P less than 0.05). Neither during the infusion of amino acids nor the glucose infusion omeprazole was able to continuously raise intragastric pH above 4.0. In conclusion, this study shows that intravenous omeprazole prevents gastric acid stimulation by intravenous amino acids but fails to continuously raise intragastric pH above 4.\r"

Motility of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine were, respectively, abnormal in two, six, and seven patients and showed either uncoordination of contractions between segments or postcibal hypomotility. All had generalized or patchy anhidrosis; quantitative sudomotor axon reflex tests were also abnormal in four patients and borderline in one. Plasma levels of catecholamines were abnormal in one patient. All patients had evidence of sympathetic denervation: preganglionic in two patients, postganglionic in five patients, and mixed in one patient. Three patients also had abnormal heart-rate responses to deep breathing, suggesting parasympathetic dysfunction. No underlying cause for the autonomic dysfunction was identified in any of these patients despite extensive investigations. Thus, these data support the hypothesis that apparently functional gastrointestinal disorders may be due to idiopathic autonomic denervation.\r"

However, the circular muscle of the distal colon was more sensitive to vasoactive intestinal peptide than was the circular muscle of the proximal colon. Longitudinal muscle from both regions was comparatively insensitive to VIP.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of various leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor and N-formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine to augment colonic damage induced by 30% ethanol was investigated in the rat. Each of the mediators was tested at a dose of 2 nmol, administered intracolonically in the ethanol vehicle. When colonic damage was assessed 72 hr later, only leukotriene B4 significantly augmented damage compared to the controls. The incidence of ulcers increased from 35% in the control group to 90% in the group receiving leukotriene B4. Leukotriene B4 administration also resulted in significant increases in colonic myeloperoxidase activity and colonic leukotriene B4 synthesis. To assess the possible contribution of infiltrating neutrophils to the increase in colonic leukotriene B4 synthesis that accompanies colonic inflammation, colitis was induced in normal and neutropenic rats by intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Neutropenia was achieved by treatment with an antineutrophil serum. In the neutropenic animals killed 4 hr after induction of colitis significant changes in leukotriene B4 synthesis were not observed, whereas a fourfold increase was observed in the controls. From these studies we conclude the following: (1) leukotriene B4, at a dose of 2 nmol, can significantly potentiate the colonic ulceration induced by 30% ethanol; (2) this action of leukotriene B4 is not shared by the same dose of the other inflammatory mediators tested; and (3) infiltrating neutrophils are the major source of colonic leukotriene B4 synthesis in a rat model of colitis.\r"

Fourteen healthy volunteers were studied for a total of 284 hr (mean of 20.3 hr/subject). Anorectal manometry was performed using a probe with twin pressure sensors. EMG was recorded by one indifferent and two differential silver-silver chloride surface electrodes positioned 0.5-0.75 cm from the anus on either side. The sampling reflex occurred frequently and was significantly (P less than 0.001) more common during wakefulness than during sleep and also following meals than during fasting (P less than 0.01). The passage of flatus was associated with transient relaxation of the anal canal in 19% of episodes. In contrast, there was a contractile episode with no preceding relaxation in 75% of episodes. The anal sphincter had significantly (P less than 0.05) more action potentials (APs) during the day (12.8 +/- 3.2 APs/10 min) than at night (1.6 +/- 1.3 APs/10 min). During micturition, anal canal pressure rose (mean 15 mm Hg) in association with powerful external anal sphincter contractions. Our data show that, normally, contractile activity both in the anal canal and external anal sphincter maintains fecal continence during micturition and the passage of flatus. The technique should lead to a better understanding of the normal mechanisms of fecal continence during waking and sleep and of the pathophysiology of disorders of anorectal function.\r"

The patients were treated with either cisapride, 10 mg four times a day (N = 36) or cimetidine, 400 mg four times a day (N = 37) for six weeks, or for 12 weeks if mucosal healing was not obtained by week 6. Upon entry, two thirds of the patients in each group had grade I (Savary-Miller) esophagitis, and the remainder grade II or III. At the end of treatment, endoscopy showed mucosal healing in 56% (38-72%; 95% confidence interval) of cisapride and 57% (39-73%; 95% confidence interval) of cimetidine patients. After six weeks, both drugs significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased the intensity and frequency of heartburn, regurgitation, and the postural syndrome. No significant intergroup differences were found regarding endoscopic parameters or the improvement of heartburn and regurgitation. Concomitant antacid use was also comparable. Adverse effects were reported by four cisapride and nine cimetidine patients. These results indicate that the effects of cisapride compare well with those of cimetidine in terms of both esophageal mucosal healing and symptom relief.\r"

The arthritis-dermatitis syndrome was one of the common distressing disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism was thought to be an immune-complex-mediated process related to bypass enteritis. Antiarthritic medication was ineffective in most instances, and the skin lesions were refractory to treatment. A 45-year-old woman was suffering from the disorder as described above. She also had diarrhea, a low hematocrit, an elevated white blood cell count, and an increased sedimentation rate. Her nutritional status was satisfactory, presumably because of adaptive hypertrophy of the short functioning small intestinal segment. The patient adamantly refused dismantling of the bypass or any gastric restriction operations. Therefore, the blind loop, the source of her disease, was excised with immediate relief of all ill effects and restoration of normal laboratory findings. The patient has been entirely well since, and her weight has remained stable for one year.\r"

This case may also represent a rare complication of therapeutic ERCP procedures.

An endometrial biopsy was taken during both cycles 1.5 to 2.0 days after the oocytes had been released or removed. The samples were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Samples of peripheral blood were taken at defined times for hormone analysis. After treatment 11 subjects (85%) had advanced morphological development of the endometrium (8 women by 3 to 4 days, 3 women by 1 to 2 days). The concentrations of plasma estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) on the days of follicular rupture and endometrial biopsy were significantly raised in the treatment cycles. The concentration of total urinary estrogens on the day of hCG administration and the mean change in the concentration of plasma E2 (treatment/control) on the days of endometrial biopsy were positively correlated with the extent of endometrial advancement. In addition, the mean change in the concentration of plasma P (treatment/control) was markedly increased on the days of follicular rupture and endometrial biopsy in those subjects with an advanced endometrium. Embryonic development was not so obviously related to the extent of superovulation. Asynchronous endometrial and embryonic development may therefore contribute to the low pregnancy rate in these patients.\r"

Immunoprecipitation was performed with rabbit antihuman C3 immunoglobulin G and only a single 180-kDa radiolabeled protein (C3) was immunoprecipitated. This protein dissociates into 113- and 69-kDa subunits in the presence of dithiothreitol. The amount of C3 produced and secreted by the endometrium was quantitated as a percentage of counts per minute recovered by immunoprecipitation. Patients with minimal endometriosis produced significantly greater amounts of endometrial C3 than patients with no endometriosis or patients with severe endometriosis.\r"

Inhibitory activity was dependent on the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and was abrogated both by heat treatment of the serum and by pretreatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Spermine becomes toxic when oxidized by monoamine oxidase to spermine dialdehyde or acrolein. Spermine also shows suppressive activity in the same molecular weight range as IVF supernatants. These data suggest IVF-associated inhibitory activity may be attributable to oxidation of a polyamine, possibly spermine, by monoamine oxidase in FBS. The biological significance is discussed.\r"

Bead counts obtained with the Micro-Cell chamber or hemocytometer were not statistically different from those determined by electronic particle counting, whereas Makler chamber counts were 62% higher. Makler counts had a significantly higher standard deviation, suggesting that counts made with this device are less reproducible. Analyzing live sperm samples, the percentage of motile sperm determined using Micro-Cell and Makler chambers were similar. However, significant differences in sperm concentration and mean velocity were found. The Micro-Cell disposable chamber provided consistent and accurate data on sperm concentration, percent motility, and mean velocity. These differences in sperm measurements emphasize the importance of sampling chamber characteristics on data reliability.\r"

Included in each straw was a sucrose solution, isosmotic to the propylene glycol solution, to serve as an osmotic buffer during dilution of the cryoprotectant out of the ova. This one-step method of dilution permitted the ova to be recovered and diluted out of the cryoprotectant within the straw in which they had been originally frozen. A total of 547 cryopreserved ova were thawed, 504 (92.1%) of which were morphologically normal after they had been incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 hours. After removal of the zonae, the frozen-thawed ova were compared with fresh, control ova in SPAs of donor and patient semen that had been capacitated in TEST-yolk buffer. The percent penetration and penetration index of fresh versus cryopreserved ova did not differ significantly for either donor or patient semen.\r"

Glandular epithelial cells in zone IV retained strong positive staining for both E2 and P receptor. Cytosolic and occupied nuclear E2 receptor analyzed biochemically were significantly reduced on day 23.

Animals with experimentally induced endometriosis were fertile and the number of embryos on day 10 of pregnancy was not different from the control group. Ectopic implants which regressed during pregnancy recurred 1 month after parturition. It is concluded that endometrial cells may survive at the implanted site even after apparent complete morphological regression, which has the potential to grow into an implant.\r"

To further study this phenomenon, we have established a model to test the effect of peritoneal fluid (PF) from endometriosis patients on early reproductive events in vivo. Sexually mature female golden hamsters were subjected to an ovarian hyperstimulation protocol and divided into groups that received the following intraperitoneal injections: (1) saline, (2) human serum albumin (HSA), (3) PF from fertile controls, and (4) PF from stage I/II endometriosis patients. Animals were killed on days 4 and 17; reproductive performance was assessed by the number of oocytes and embryos recovered on day 4 and the number of uterine swellings counted on day 17. Reproductive performance was significantly impaired by PF from endometriosis patients; animals treated with control PF and HSA did not differ from control. These data demonstrate a marked impairment of early in vivo reproductive performance under the influence of endometriosis PF. These results support a role for a soluble PF component as a mediator in the pathogenesis of endometriosis-associated subfertility.\r"

Furthermore, the concentration of endometrial antibody titers was significantly higher in serum than peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. These results suggest that serum endometrial antibody assay is specific and valuable for the diagnosis and progress of endometriosis.\r"

At puberty, there is an increase in insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) levels, and because IGF-I has been implicated in the early kidney enlargement of experimental diabetes, we studied the development of kidney enlargement and kidney IGF-I levels in prepubertal (aged 5 wk) and postpubertal (aged 13 wk) Sprague-Dawley rats during the 7 days after induction of diabetes with streptozocin. Kidney weight in postpubertal diabetic animals was significantly greater than in postpubertal controls by day 2 (1.46 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.09 g, P less than 0.05), and by day 7, kidney weight had increased by 36% (1.61 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.18 +/- 0.08 g, P less than 0.001). Despite comparable blood glucose levels in the prepubertal and postpubertal diabetic rats, kidney weight in prepubertal diabetic animals was significantly greater than in prepubertal controls by 14% on day 7 only (0.84 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.03 g, P less than 0.05). Kidney IGF-I content was significantly elevated in diabetic postpubertal rats, peaking on day 1 (diabetic vs. control, 1082 +/- 156 vs. 543 +/- 21 ng/g, P less than 0.001) and day 2 but not in prepubertal diabetic rats. Thus, prepubertal diabetic rats have reduced and retarded kidney growth and attenuated kidney IGF-I levels, suggesting that local IGF-I accumulation may play an important role in diabetes-associated kidney enlargement.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that myo-inositol in the cultured rat embryo is diminished whenever malformations are induced by hyperglycemia and that the malformations and reductions of tissue myo-inositol content are not corrected by aldose reductase inhibitors. This study was designed to evaluate the kinetics of myo-[3H]inositol uptake in vitro during 1-, 3-, and 24-h intervals in the 10.5-day rat conceptus (10-12 somites). We found that the equilibration between tissue and medium is relatively slow and that the concentration of free myo-inositol in tissue is only approximately threefold greater than in the medium even after 24 h. The integrated uptake of free myo-inositol by the intact 10.5-day conceptus is a saturable process with a Km (246 +/- 16 microM) consistent with a low-affinity system. The net rate of accumulation into the tissue pool of free myo-inositol exceeds the rate of incorporation of the accumulated myo-inositol into lipid components. Ambient glucose inhibits net myo-inositol uptake in a concentration-dependent fashion, and the inhibition is competitive in nature. The glucose-mediated inhibitions of myo-inositol transport also compromise the concurrent incorporation of myo-[3H]inositol into lipid components, although to a lesser extent. These inhibitory effects are relatively specific for D-glucose and not replicated by equimolar additions of D-mannose or D-galactose. myo-Inositol accumulation by the 10.5-day rat conceptus is also impaired by relatively specific inhibitors of D-glucose transport such as phloridzin or ouabain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is an excellent model of insulin-dependent (type I) human diabetes mellitus. We report that a single injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) given at an early age (5 wk) prevented the appearance of diabetes and greatly increased the life span of NOD mice without additional therapy. No treated mouse developed hyperglycemia by the age of 12 mo (n = 13), whereas all untreated mice died of diabetes before 8 mo of age (n = 38). All CFA-treated mice were alive and healthy at 12 mo of age. Some CFA-treated NOD mice that were monitored for long-term survival are still alive with no sign of disease at 18 mo of age (n = 5). Administration of CFA resulted in decreased in vitro splenic lymphocyte proliferative responses to alloantigen and mitogen. Cell-mixing experiments indicated that antigen-nonspecific inhibitory cells were elicited in the spleen and increased in the bone marrow. These regulatory cells were Thy-1- and nonadherent to nylon wool, as has been described for natural suppressor (NS) cells. These data lend support to a relationship between the boosting of endogenous NS activity and the establishment of tolerance to self in the context of autoimmunity. Our results suggest that early nonspecific immunotherapy of genetically predisposed individuals could prevent the development of autoimmune diabetes.\r"

Induction of diabetes with streptozocin (30 mg/kg) lowered the lasting insulin level from 11.4 to 3.8 ng/ml, which was not significantly greater than the lean control level. Autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity of liver insulin receptors were increased 70-100% in the obese control group (relative to lean rats), but diabetes reversed this hyperresponsiveness to insulin. In muscle, obesity was associated with a 40-50% decrease in autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity, which was also reversed in the diabetic state. Autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity were significantly correlated in liver and muscle and were also correlated with fasting insulin levels. These data suggest that insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase activity is regulated differently in liver and muscle and that the abnormalities in kinase activity associated with the obese Zucker rat are at least partly secondary to hyperinsulinemia.\r"

Although intestinal HMG-CoA reductase activity was significantly increased (P less than 0.001) in poorly controlled compared with moderately controlled diabetic rabbits, there was a significant reduction in the activities of intestinal ACAT (P less than 0.01), hepatic HMG-CoA reductase (P less than 0.05) and ACAT (P less than 0.001), and phenol 2-monooxygenase (P less than 0.01). The poorly controlled animals were hypercholesterolemic (P less than 0.01), and this was reflected in the very-low-density and high-density lipoprotein fractions. Serum cholesterol levels in the nondiabetic and moderately controlled diabetic groups were similar. This increase in intestinal HMG-CoA reductase activity in the poorly controlled diabetic animals occurred in the absence of hyperphagia. Although abnormalities in cellular cholesterol metabolism could be partly responsible for the alterations in serum cholesterol levels in diabetes, the precise mechanisms underlying these enzymatic changes have yet to be elucidated.\r"

Immobility and the use of bedpans instead of commodes contribute to decreased bladder emptying and an increased potential for UTI. Poor perineal hygiene in many females in nursing homes also increases the potential for UTI.

The rings of the thoracic aorta were obtained from age-matched SHR and WKY rats, and changes in isometric tension were recorded. The relaxant responses to acetylcholine in the aortic rings from SHR were significantly weaker than those from WKY rats. The relaxant responses to acetylcholine were significantly enhanced by pretreatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) or thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist (ONO-3708) in aortic rings from both SHR and WKY rats. A thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) did not affect the acetylcholine-induced relaxation in the aortic rings from SHR or WKY rats. In the organ bath solution, after acetylcholine stimulation, prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentrations increased but not prostaglandin F2 alpha and thromboxane B2 concentrations. Exogenous prostaglandin H2, a stable analogue of thromboxane A2, and prostaglandin F2 alpha induced contractions of the SHR rings at a lower concentration than prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin D2, and prostaglandin I2. These contractile responses to various prostaglandins were markedly inhibited by pretreatment with ONO-3708. A prostacyclin synthetase inhibitor did not affect the relaxant responses to acetylcholine in the SHR rings. These results show that endothelium-derived contracting factor is produced and released by acetylcholine stimulation not only in the aorta of SHR but also in those of WKY rats and suggest that prostaglandin H2, a precursor of the released prostaglandins, is a strong candidate for endothelium-derived contracting factor produced by acetylcholine stimulation.\r"

L-NMMA (0.3-300 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent, long-lasting (5-90 minutes), and enantiomerically specific increase in mean blood pressure and also caused bradycardia. The increase in blood pressure was accompanied by a dose-dependent and long-lasting vasoconstriction in the internal carotid, mesenteric, renal, and hindquarters vascular beds that could be attenuated, in a concentration-dependent manner, by L-arginine but not by D-arginine. In contrast, L-arginine did not affect the pressor or vasoconstrictor effects of vasopressin. These results indicate that nitric oxide production by vascular endothelial cells contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure and to the control of the resting tone of different vascular beds in the conscious rat.\r"

Heating was stopped when a colonic temperature of 41 degrees C was attained. Baseline levels of arterial pressure were similar in the two groups, whereas heart rate was elevated in deafferented versus sham-operated rats (p less than 0.01). The increases above baseline for both arterial pressure (73 +/- 4 vs. 27 +/- 2 mm Hg) and heart rate (127 +/- 10 vs. 33 +/- 5 beats/min) were threefold to fourfold greater at the end of heating in the deafferented versus the sham group (p less than 0.01). Declines in mesenteric and renal blood flow were similar in the two groups during heating; however, deafferented rats had greater increases in both mesenteric and renal vascular resistance (p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine was elevated at baseline in deafferented versus sham rats and increased in both groups during heating (p less than 0.01).

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the associations of body fat and its distribution with casual and ambulatory blood pressure in nonobese men. One hundred and thirty-five normotensive or mildly hypertensive (but untreated) men employed at three work sites were studied. Casual blood pressure was measured at the work site at initial screening and on a second occasion by a nurse. Ambulatory blood pressure was measured noninvasively for 24 hours on a workday and analyzed as work, home, and sleep blood pressure measurements. Anthropometric measurements included height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences. Blood pressure was highest while at work; home blood pressure was higher than screening blood pressure or nurse blood pressure, and sleep blood pressure was lowest. Weight and both waist and hip circumferences (but not their ratio) were all significantly correlated with screening, nurse, and sleep blood pressures but not with work or home blood pressures. Stepwise regression analysis showed that waist circumference was the best overall predictor of blood pressure. We suggest that in situations where blood pressure is the dependent variable, correlations with other variables may be closest for \"basal\" measures of blood pressure and may be obscured by the effects of daily activities on blood pressure.\r"

At rest, sympathetic and parasympathetic outflows were related reciprocally: heart failure patients had high sympathetic and low parasympathetic outflows, and healthy subjects had low sympathetic and high parasympathetic outflows. Low dose atropine, which is known to increase the activity of central vagal-cardiac motoneurons, significantly increased R-R intervals in healthy subjects, but did not alter R-R intervals in heart failure patients. Thus, our data document reciprocal supranormal sympathetic and subnormal parasympathetic outflows in heart failure patients and suggest that these abnormalities result in part from abnormalities within the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Vitronectin (Vn) is a multifunctional 75-kD glycoprotein that is present in plasma and the extracellular matrix. Vn functions as a complement regulatory protein in plasma, and promotes the growth and attachment of cells in tissue culture. Recent cDNA cloning reveals that like other adhesive proteins, Vn contains the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp and binds to some members of the integrin class of adhesive membrane receptors. In liposomes, the platelet membrane glycoprotein complex IIb/IIIa binds Vn, as well as fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin. We examined the binding of purified Vn to resting and stimulated human platelets. Vn bound to thrombin-stimulated platelets in a calcium-dependent, specific, and saturable manner with a Kd of 320 nM and 8,000 sites per platelet. Epinephrine or ADP stimulation led to specific binding with KdS of 93 and 116 nM, respectively. Binding was inhibited by the tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and by monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to GPIIb/IIIa. Endogenous platelet Vn stores were identified in immunoblots of gel-filtered platelets and the surface expression of endogenous platelet Vn was thrombin inducible. Monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibodies to Vn inhibited platelet aggregation, suggesting that Vn plays a role in the formation of stable platelet aggregates.\r"

  ".W": "Ro/SS-A antibodies are found in a number of human autoimmune disorders including Sjogren's syndrome and several systemic lupus erythematosus-related disorders. These heterogeneous autoantibodies are known to recognize several distinct cellular antigens. With synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to amino acid sequence information we have isolated a full-length cDNA clone which encodes a human Ro ribonucleoprotein autoantigen. The 1,890-base pair clone contains an open reading frame that encodes a 417-amino acid, 48-kD polypeptide that migrates aberrantly at 60 kD by SDS-PAGE. Rabbit antibodies raised against this protein's recently described amino-terminal epitope react with a previously identified 52-kD human Ro protein and immunoprecipitate the human cytoplasmic RNAs. Ultraviolet light cross-linking studies suggest that this Ro protein binds each of the four major human cytoplasmic RNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence is 63% homologous to an Onchocerca volvulus antigen. Southern filter hybridization analysis indicates that this gene is not highly polymorphic and exists as a single copy in the human genome. Chromosomal localization studies place this gene on the short arm of chromosome 19 near the gene encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether IL-6 participates in the host response to intrauterine infection, we studied IL-6 bioactivity and isoforms in amniotic fluid (AF). Two different assays for IL-6 were used: the hepatocyte stimulating factor assay (in Hep3B2 cells) and the SDS-PAGE/immunoblot assay. IL-6 determinations were performed in 205 AF samples. Samples were obtained from patients in the midtrimester of pregnancy (n = 25), at term with no labor (n = 31), at term in active labor (n = 40), and from patients in preterm labor (n = 109). Higher AF IL-6 levels were observed in women in preterm labor with intraamniotic infection than in women in preterm labor without intraamniotic infection (median = 375 ng/ml, range = 30-5000 ng/ml vs. median = 1.5 ng/ml, range = 0-500, respectively, P less than 0.0001). The 23-25- and 28-30-kD IL-6 species could be readily detected in SDS-PAGE immunoblots performed directly on 10-microliters aliquots of AF from patients with intraamniotic infection. Among women in preterm labor with culture-negative AF, those who failed to respond to subsequent tocolytic treatment had higher AF IL-6 concentrations than those who responded to therapy (median = 50 ng/ml vs. median = 1.2 ng/ml, respectively, P less than 0.05). Only low levels of IL-6 were detected in AF obtained from normal women in the midtrimester and third trimester of pregnancy. Decidual tissue explants obtained from the placentas of women undergoing elective cesarean section at term without labor (n = 11) produced IL-6 in response to bacterial endotoxin. In a pilot study, AF IL-6 was determined in 56 consecutive women admitted with preterm labor. All patients (n = 10) with elevated AF IL-6 (cutoff = 46 ng/ml) delivered a premature neonate. 4 of these 10 patients had positive AF cultures for microorganisms. These studies implicate IL-6 in the host response to intrauterine infection and suggest that evaluation of AF IL-6 levels may have diagnostic and prognostic value in the management of women in preterm labor.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of varying degrees and durations of hypernatremia on the brain concentrations of organic compounds believed to be important, so-called \"idiogenic\" osmoles in rats by means of conventional biochemical assays, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no changes in the concentrations of these osmoles (specifically myoinositol, sorbitol, betaine, glycerophosphorylcholine [GPC], phosphocreatine, glutamine, glutamate, and taurine) in rats with acute (2 h) hypernatremia (serum Na 194 +/- 5 meq/liter). With severe (serum Na 180 +/- 4 meq/liter) chronic (7 d) hypernatremia, the concentrations of each of these osmoles except sorbitol increased significantly: myoinositol (65%), betaine (54%), GPC (132%), phosphocreatine (73%), glutamine (143%), glutamate (84%), taurine (78%), and urea (191%). Together, these changes account for 35% of the change in total brain osmolality. With moderate (serum Na 159 +/- 3 meq/liter) hypernatremia, more modest but significant increases in the concentrations of each of these osmoles except betaine and sorbitol were noted. When rats with severe chronic hypernatremia were allowed to drink water freely, their serum sodium as well as the brain concentrations of all of these organic osmoles except myoinositol returned to normal within 2 d. It is concluded that: idiogenic osmoles play an important role in osmoregulation in the brain of rats subjected to hypernatremia; the development of these substances occur more slowly than changes in serum sodium; and the decrease in concentration of myoinositol occurs significantly more slowly than the decrease in serum sodium which occurs when animals are allowed free access to water. These observations may be relevant to the clinical management of patients with hypernatremia.\r"

To determine if sympathetic activation is attenuated when muscle glycogenolysis is blocked due to myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease), an inborn enzymatic defect localized to skeletal muscle, we now have performed microelectrode recordings of MSNA in four patients with McArdle's disease during static handgrip contraction. A level of static handgrip that more than doubled MSNA in normal humans had no effect on MSNA and caused an attenuated rise in blood pressure in the patients with myophosphorylase deficiency. In contrast, two nonexercise sympathetic stimuli, Valsalva's maneuver and cold pressor stimulation, evoked comparably large increases in MSNA in patients and normals. The principal new conclusion is that defective glycogen degradation in human skeletal muscle is associated with a specific reflex impairment in sympathetic activation during static exercise.\r"

To examine the regulatory influence of dietary phosphate on the renal vitamin D catabolic pathway in Hyp mice, we measured C-24 oxidation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in renal mitochondria isolated from Hyp mice and normal littermates fed diets containing 0.03% (low-Pi), 1% (control-Pi), and 1.6% (high-Pi) phosphate. In normal mice the low-Pi diet led to a rise in serum 1,25(OH)2D (22.2 +/- 1.8 to 48.1 +/- 6.8 pg/ml, P less than 0.05) and no change in C-24 oxidation products (0.053 +/- 0.006 to 0.066 +/- 0.008 pmol/mg protein per min) when compared with the control diet. In Hyp mice the low-Pi diet elicited a fall in serum 1,25(OH)2D (21.9 +/- 1.2 to 8.0 +/- 0.2 pg/ml, P less than 0.05) and a dramatic increase in C-24 oxidation products (0.120 +/- 0.017 to 0.526 +/- 0.053 pmol/mg protein per min, P less than 0.05) when compared with the control diet. The high-Pi diet did not significantly alter serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D or C-24 oxidation products in normal mice. Hyp mice on the high-Pi diet experienced a rise in serum 1,25(OH)2D (21.9 +/- 1.2 to 40.4 +/- 7.3, P less than 0.05) and a fall in C-24 oxidation products (0.120 +/- 0.017 to 0.043 +/- 0.007 pmol/mg protein per min, P less than 0.05). The present results demonstrate that the defect in C-24 oxidation of 1,25(OH)2D3 in Hyp mice is exacerbated by phosphate depletion and corrected by phosphate supplementation. The data suggest that the disorder in vitamin D metabolism in the mutant strain is secondary to the perturbation in phosphate homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Moderate alcohol intoxication in man, a ubiqitious social event, causes acute but reversible myocardial depression, the mechanism of which is unknown. We investigated whether this depression could be due to a direct effect of ethanol on the process of electromechanical coupling by simultaneously measuring the transmembrane action potential and contraction, or the cytosolic calcium transient (via aequorin photoluminescence) and contraction in isolated ferret right ventricular papillary muscle. Ethanol, in concentrations that are similar to plasma levels in man during intoxication (0.15 vol %), depressed the force of contraction approximately 10%. The step in the electromechanical process that was affected appeared to be the calcium-myofilament interaction, as there was no change in the transmembrane action potential or cytosolic calcium transient. This inhibition was quickly reversed by removal of the ethanol from the perfusate. On the other hand, higher concentrations of ethanol produced changes in contraction, the calcium transient, and the action potential, suggesting multiple levels of inhibition of electromechanical coupling. Increasing the perfusate calcium or use of the calcium channel agonist, BAY-K 8644, increased cytosolic calcium to near maximum but had little effect on contractility, confirming that the relationship between calcium and the myofilaments had been altered. These data suggest that the acute depression in ventricular function seen with alcohol consumption may be due to a direct effect on electromechanical coupling through inhibition of the calcium myofilament interaction.\r"

Purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography over carboxymethyl Sephadex, G-75 Sephadex, and hydrophobic interaction HPLC, demonstratively endotoxin-free CAP37 was maximally chemotactic over a range of 1.3 X 10(-9)-10(-8) M. Thus it was active in the same molar concentrations as formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. CAP37 lacked chemotactic activity for neutrophils and lymphocytes. In checkerboard assays CAP37 had some chemokinetic activity as well. It was also chemotactic for rabbit mononuclear cells. Higher concentrations (2.7 X 10(-8) M) were required for activity with rabbit cells than with human. Sequence analysis of the first 42 NH2-terminal amino acid residues of CAP37 showed strong homologies with known serine proteases that mediate various functions in inflammation. However, a critical substitution of a serine for a histidine at position 41 suggested that CAP37 lacked serine protease action. This impression was supported by the failure of CAP37 to bind tritiated diisopropyl fluorophosphate. 89% of total CAP37 was released extracellularly from human neutrophils while they phagocytized Staphylococcus aureus. We propose that CAP37 released from neutrophils during phagocytosis and degranulation may mediate recruitment of monocytes in the second wave of inflammation.\r"

We have determined that the protein-LMW DNA complexes responsible for these effects are nucleosomal constituents of chromatin, since the mitogenically active fractions of these cell-free supernatants contain the constituents of core histones (H3, H2A, H2B, H4) together with LMW DNA (140-180 bp), and since the immunoproliferative effects of these cell-free supernatants could be mimicked by various other nucleoprotein preparations (including calf thymus and chicken erythrocyte nucleosomes). The spontaneous cellular release of cleaved chromatin constituents in vitro can be attributed to a form of programmed cell death termed apoptosis, since the cultured spleen cells exhibited (a) morphologic evidence consistent with this process by electron microscopy, and (b) evidence of intracellular cleavage of chromatin which, like apoptosis, could be blocked with ZnSO4. This resulted in inhibition of the extracellular release of nucleosomal constituents as well as the immunoproliferative effects of the cell-free supernatants. The immunoproliferative effect of nucleosomes released from cells during apoptosis could be responsible for previously observed spontaneous in vitro anti-DNA and anti-histone antibody responses of murine spleen cells, and in vivo in normal lymphoid tissues, resulting in renewed cellular proliferation after cell death. In pathological states, this could result in abnormal polyclonal B cell proliferation and autoantibody formation.\r"

J. Clin. Invest. 83:1204-1210). We have also prepared mouse MAbs against the 10-12-kD HRF (1989. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 83:281). Affinity-purified 10-12-kD HRF appears as a broad band upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. We determined the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the top and bottom halves of this broad band. Sequence analysis revealed striking homology between this HRF and connective tissue activating peptide-III (CTAP-III), a platelet-derived 8-10-kD protein known to cause mitogenesis and extracellular matrix formation in fibroblast cultures. 19 of 21 NH2-terminal residues in the top half of the HRF band were identical to the NH2-terminal sequence of CTAP-III. 20 of 21 NH2-terminal residues in the bottom half were identical to the NH2-terminal sequence of neutrophil-activating peptide-2, which is derived from CTAP-III by proteolytic cleavage between residues 15 and 16. Purified CTAP-III also released histamine from basophils. Rabbit antiserum raised against either native or recombinant CTAP-III recognized affinity-purified HRF in immunodot blot assays, and MAb against HRF recognized CTAP-III in both dot blot and microtiter plate based immunoassays. These data demonstrate the first structural, functional, and immunologic relationship between one form of human HRF and a previously described cell product.\r"

To analyze the genetic defect in these receptor-negative patients, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify each individual exon of the androgen receptor gene in nine affected patients. In all patients, the size of each amplified exon segment was identical to that in normal individuals. The nucleotide sequence of the entire coding region of the androgen receptor was determined in one of these patients. A single nucleotide substitution was identified that results in a premature termination codon in exon 6 at amino acid 794. S1 nuclease protection assays demonstrated that normal levels of androgen receptor mRNA are present in skin fibroblasts of this patient. Transfection of a mutated androgen receptor cDNA containing a termination codon at position 794 into eukaryotic cells resulted in formation of a normal amount of receptor protein, as indicated by immunoblotting, but the expressed protein does not bind 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. These findings suggest that the presence of a premature termination codon at amino acid 794 of the androgen receptor is the cause of androgen resistance in this patient.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation of human blood monocytes inhibits their accessory cell function for antigen- and mitogen-induced T cell responses. These studies were designed to characterize the nature of the UVB-induced defect in human monocyte accessory cell function. Irradiated monocytes were deficient in their ability to serve as accessory cells for OKT3-induced T cell activation. In vitro exposure of monocytes to 100 J/m2 UVB completely inhibited the T cell proliferative response (51502 cpm, non-UVB-irradiated; 302 cpm, UVB-irradiated). Analysis of the accessory signals altered by UVB indicated that irradiated monocytes were incapable of binding to OKT3 molecules attached to the CD3 antigen on T cells. Provision of an alternative mechanism for binding of OKT3 molecules by attaching anti-mouse IgG to the bottom of microtiter wells completely restored accessory cell function. Further characterization of the defect demonstrated that UVB radiation did not deplete p72 Fc receptors from the surface of irradiated monocytes. However, UVB exposure did produce a dose-dependent decrease in monocyte membrane expression of ICAM-1. It is proposed that UVB radiation leads to changes within the cell membrane that inhibit the ability of monocytes to express selected molecules necessary for binding of T cells.\r"

After intravenous injection, human Lp(a) was cleared slowly from the plasma of normal mice. The clearance was markedly accelerated in transgenic mice that expressed large amounts of LDL receptors. We conclude that the covalent attachment of apo(a) to apo B-100 in Lp(a) does not interfere markedly with the ability of apo B-100 to bind to the LDL receptor and that this receptor has the potential to play a major role in clearance of Lp(a) from the circulation of intact humans.\r"

To help identify new mutations of the X-linked SCID gene and to provide genetic counseling, X chromosome inactivation patterns in T cells from 16 women who had sons with sporadic SCID were examined. Between 9 and 35 human/hamster hybrids that selectively retained the active human X chromosome were produced from the T cells of each woman and analyzed with an X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism for which the woman in question was heterozygous. Exclusive use of a single X as the active X was seen in the T cell hybrids from 7 of the 16 women, identifying these women as carriers of X-linked SCID. Studies on additional family members confirmed the mutant nature of the inactive X and revealed the source of the new mutation in three families. To determine whether there were any laboratory characteristics that might differentiate the boys whose mothers were identified as carriers of X-linked SCID from those whose mothers were not, the clinical records of both groups were compared to each other and to a group of 14 boys with a family history of X-linked SCID. The most consistent finding in the 21 patients with X-linked SCID was an elevated proportion of B cells. These data demonstrate the high incidence of spontaneous mutation for the X-linked SCID gene and help clarify the characteristic presenting features of this disorder.\r"

Its serum concentration is elevated in patients with peptide-producing endocrine neoplasia. We measured serum chromogranin A at the time of diagnosis in 34 children with all stages of neuroblastoma. With a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 100%, serum chromogranin A emerged as a useful diagnostic tool for neuroblastoma, comparable to or better than other measurements such as neuron-specific enolase, ferritin, or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. Mean serum chromogranin A correlated with disease stage (r = 0.76, P less than 0.01). The relationship of prognosis (progression-free survival) to baseline serum chromogranin A, age, and disease stage was determined in 34 patients at risk for relapse, with a median followup period of 18 mo (range, 1-48 mo). The survival rate for patients with lower serum chromogranin A levels (less than 190 ng/ml at the time of diagnosis) was 69%, whereas it was 30% for those with higher chromogranin A levels (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, when subjects were additionally stratified by either age or stage, chromogranin A was an effective prognostic tool in patients who either were older than 1 yr (P less than 0.005) or had more advanced disease (stage III or IV; P less than 0.05). We conclude that serum chromogranin A in neuroblastoma is (a) a valuable (sensitive and specific) diagnostic tool, (b) a correlate of tumor burden, and (c) a useful predictor of survival.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a hematopoietic growth factor that supports the growth of early hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. In vivo administration of recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3) to normal primates results in a modest and delayed leukocytosis secondary to increases in neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. We postulated that the effects of rhIL-3 might be more pronounced in hematologically stressed primates, and therefore administered rhIL-3 to primates after intensive myelosuppressive therapy. Primates received either cyclophosphamide (CPM) at 60 mg/kg or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 75 mg/kg i.v. on two consecutive days. Subsequently, rhIL-3 was administered intravenously or subcutaneously at 20 micrograms/kg per d for 14 d. Compared to controls, all rhIL-3 treated primates experienced higher absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadirs and dramatic decreases in the period of severe neutropenia (ANC less than 500) after myelosuppressive therapy. RhIL-3 administration resulted in a significant basophilia and eosinophilia, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. RhIL-3 did not enhance erythroid recovery. Platelet recovery was earlier in rhIL-3-treated animals. However, variations in the platelet recovery observed in control animals, precluded accurate estimation of this effect or its significance. Our results indicate that the administration of rhIL-3 following intensive myelosuppressive therapy dramatically enhances myeloid recovery and ablates the predicted period of prolonged severe neutropenia.\r"

Cells from this patient had previously been shown to synthesize a labile variant SCAD in contrast to the normal stability of variant SCADs in two other SCAD-deficient cell lines (Naito, E., Y. Indo, and K. Tanaka. 1989. J. Clin. Invest. 84:1671-1674). In the present study, both mutant alleles of YH2065 were found to contain a C----T transition, one at position 136 and the other at position 319 of the coding region of pSCAD cDNA. Clones of cDNA amplified from this region showed only one of the C----T transitions, indicating that each mutation was derived from different pSCAD alleles. Each of these mutations altered a known restriction endonuclease site, and restriction analysis of additional cDNA clones from amplified mutant cDNA and Southern blotting of mutant genomic DNA confirmed the presence of two unique mutant alleles in YH2065, indicating YH2065 is a compound heterozygote. These C----T transitions result in the substitution of Arg-22 and Arg-83 of the mature SCAD with Trp and Cys, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Most cases of cytosol-defective chronic granulomatous disease are due to the deficiency of a 47-kD protein (p47-phox) whose phosphorylation normally accompanies the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase. Recently, a form of chronic granulomatous disease was described in which the failure of O2- production was associated with the absence of a 67-kD polypeptide (p67-phox) from the cytosol of affected neutrophils. Using neutrophils obtained from a patient with this form of the disease, we examined the function of p67-phox in the activation of the oxidase. Our studies showed that in whole p67-phox-deficient neutrophils, p47-phox was phosphorylated in a normal fashion. In the cell-free oxidase-activating system, the ability of the p67-phox-deficient cytosol to support oxidase activation was partly restored by the addition of p47-phox-deficient cytosol; the p67-phox-deficient cytosol, however, was not complemented by cytosol inactivated with NADPH dialdehyde, an affinity label previously found to block the NADPH-binding component of the oxidase. Despite these differences, the kinetic properties of the p67-phox-deficient cytosol closely resembled those of the p47-phox-deficient cytosol. Taken together with earlier findings, these results suggest that (a) in the neutrophil cytosol, p67-phox is at least partly complexed to p47-phox; (b) it is in the form of this complex that p67-phox participates in oxidase activation; and (c) p47-phox appears to be translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane during oxidase activation, but complexation to p67-phox is not necessary for this translocation, nor for the accompanying extra protein phosphorylation.\r"

T lymphocytes appeared to be an important source of 1,25(OH)2D3 production, since purified T lymphocytes from all patients with tuberculosis produced 1,25(OH)2D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 production by these cells correlated closely with that produced by unseparated lavage cells. Because 1,25(OH)2D3 can improve the capacity of macrophages to kill mycobacteria, our results support the conclusion that macrophage-lymphocyte interactions, mediated at least in part by 1,25(OH)2D3, may be an important component of a successful antituberculous immune response.\r"

Both control and myopathic muscles exhibited potentiation of peak isometric force during the postextrasystolic contraction which was associated with an increase in the peak intracellular calcium transient. Frequency-related force potentiation was attenuated in myopathic muscles compared to controls. This occurred despite an increase in resting intracellular calcium and in the peak amplitude of the calcium transient as detected with aequorin. Therefore, abnormalities in contractile function of myopathic muscles during frequency-related force potentiation are not due to decreased availability of intracellular calcium, but more likely reflect differences in myofibrillar calcium responsiveness. Sarcolemmal calcium influx may also contribute to frequency-related changes in contractile force in myopathic muscles as suggested by a decrease in action potential duration with increasing stimulation frequency which is associated with fluctuations in peak calcium transient amplitude.\r"

Basal lipolysis was not affected by aging, while the rate of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis was reduced by 50% in the elderly subjects (P less than 0.005). To elucidate the mechanisms behind this phenomenon lipolysis was stimulated with agents that act at well-defined steps in the lipolytic cascade, from the receptor down to the final step: the activation of the protein kinase/hormone-sensitive lipase complex. All agents stimulated lipolysis at a 50% lower rate in elderly as compared with young subjects (P less than 0.05 or less). However, half-maximum effective concentrations of the lipolytic agents were similar in both groups. The antilipolytic effects of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists were also the same in young and old subjects. Moreover, the stoichiometric properties of the beta- and alpha 2-receptors did not change with increasing age. In vivo studies performed on the same individuals likewise demonstrated an impaired lipolytic responsiveness, with 50% lower plasma glycerol concentrations during exercise in the elderly subjects (P less than 0.05), in spite of a normal rise in plasma norepinephrine. The plasma glycerol levels correlated strongly to the glycerol release caused by catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in vitro in both young and elderly subjects (r = 0.8-0.9, P less than 0.001). In conclusion, a decreased activation of the hormone-sensitive lipase complex appears to be the mechanism underlying a blunted lipolytic response of fat cells to catecholamine stimulation in elderly subjects. This finding may, explain the age-dependent decreased lipolytic response to exercise in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "In the in vitro perfused rectal gland of the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias), the adenosine analogue 2-chloroadenosine (2Clado) completely and reversibly inhibited forskolin-stimulated chloride secretion with an IC50 of 5 nM. Other A1 receptor agonists including cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA) and R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine (R-PIA) also completely inhibited forskolin stimulated chloride secretion. The \"S\" stereoisomer of PIA (S-PIA) was a less potent inhibitor of forskolin stimulated chloride secretion, consistent with the affinity profile of PIA stereoisomers for an A1 receptor. The adenosine receptor antagonists 8-phenyltheophylline and 8-cyclopentyltheophylline completely blocked the effect of 2Clado to inhibit forskolin-stimulated chloride secretion. When chloride secretion and tissue cyclic (c)AMP content were determined simultaneously in perfused glands, 2Clado completely inhibited secretion but only inhibited forskolin stimulated cAMP accumulation by 34-40%, indicating that the mechanism of inhibition of secretion by 2Clado is at least partially cAMP independent. Consistent with these results, A1 receptor agonists only modestly inhibited (9-15%) forskolin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and 2Clado markedly inhibited chloride secretion stimulated by a permeant cAMP analogue, 8-chlorophenylthio cAMP (8CPT cAMP). These findings provide the first evidence for a high affinity A1 adenosine receptor that inhibits hormone stimulated ion transport in a model epithelia. A major portion of this inhibition occurs by a mechanism that is independent of the cAMP messenger system.\r"

Low passage isolates adhered 22-30-fold greater than a strain maintained in culture continuously. Spirochete binding to subendothelial matrix was inhibited 48-63% by pretreatment of the matrix with anti-fibronectin antiserum. Spirochete migration across endothelial monolayers cultured on amniotic membrane was increased when the monolayers were damaged by chemical or physical means. Electron microscopic examination of spirochete-endothelial interactions demonstrated the presence of spirochetes in the intercellular junctions between endothelial cells as well as beneath the monolayers. Scanning electron microscopy identified a mechanism of transendothelial migration whereby spirochetes pass between cells into the amniotic membrane at areas where subendothelium is exposed.\r"

IGF-II immunoreactivity consisted in all cases of a mixture of both higher molecular weight forms and material having the character of IGF-II itself. The former comprised a greater proportion of total IGF-II, in patients with hypoglycemia. Studies to characterize the interactions of IGF-II with serum proteins showed that (a) the radiolabeled peptide bound to an approximately 40,000-D protein in sera from both hypoglycemic patients and normal subjects, (b) sera from hypoglycemic patients and normal subjects had similar capacity to bind the radiolabeled peptide, and (c) the apparent affinities of serum binding proteins for IGF-II were the same for both hypoglycemic patients and normal subjects. Whereas, acid extracted, tumor-derived IGF-II immunoreactive peptides with low or intermediate molecular weights bound to serum proteins in a manner indistinguishable from that of IGF-II itself, the highest molecular weight IGF-II immunoreactive peptide exhibited negligible ability to compete for radiolabeled ligand binding to serum proteins. The low affinity of serum binding proteins for this component suggests that high molecular weight IGF-II immunoreactivity might circulate free and be available for interaction with cell-surface receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in animal models have suggested that alterations affecting phospholamban-mediated stimulation of Ca2+ uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum are involved in the pathophysiology of heart disease. A monoclonal antibody that binds to phospholamban and stimulates Ca2+ uptake was used to characterize phospholamban-mediated effects in human cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and to compare these effects in tissue from normal and failing hearts. Stimulation of Ca2+ uptake by anti-phospholamban monoclonal antibody simulated the effect of phosphorylation of phospholamban by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Binding of anti-phospholamban antibody reduced the K0.5 of the Ca2(+)-transporting ATPase from 0.53 microM [( Ca2+]) to 0.29 microM [( Ca2+]), without affecting Vmax or nHill. At 0.2 microM Ca2+, stimulation was 1.93-fold in sarcoplasmic reticulum prepared from normal human left ventricular myocardium and 1.94-fold in sarcoplasmic reticulum prepared from the left ventricular myocardium of patients with heart failure resulting from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Stimulation of Ca2+ uptake in canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum under identical conditions was 1.89-fold. Phospholamban-mediated stimulation of Ca2+ uptake in human cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is thus comparable in magnitude to that observed in other species and results from an increase in the apparent affinity of the Ca2(+)-transporting ATPase for Ca2+. The pathogenesis of heart failure in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy does not, however, appear to involve intrinsic alterations of this mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Several inherited disorders of fatty acid beta-oxidation have been described that relate mainly to saturated precursors. This study is the first report of an enzyme defect related only to unsaturated fatty acid oxidation and provides the first in vivo evidence that fat oxidation in humans proceeds by the reductase-dependent pathway. The patient was a black female, presenting in the neonatal period with persistent hypotonia. Biochemical studies revealed hyperlysinemia, hypocarnitinemia, normal organic acid profile, and an unusual acylcarnitine species in both urine and blood. The new metabolite was positively identified by mass spectrometry as 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcarnitine, derived from incomplete oxidation of linoleic acid. In spite of dietary therapy, the patient died of respiratory acidosis at four months of age. Samples of liver and muscle from the autopsy were assayed for 2,4-dienoyl-coenzyme A reductase activity. Using the substrate 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcoenzyme A, the reductase activity was 40% of the control value in liver and only 17% of that found in normal muscle. It is suggested that unsaturated substrates should be used for in vitro testing to cover the full range of potential beta-oxidation defects and that acylcarnitine species identification be used for in vivo detection of this disorder.\r"

The mast cell density in the granuloma, skin appendages, and intervening dermis was assessed by counting mast cells in glycol methacylate sections stained with Giemsa stain and relating these counts to area measurements obtained by planimetry. In biopsy specimens taken from the edge of established lesions the density of mast cells within the granulomata was considerably higher than that in the intervening dermis and was comparable with that found in the appendages. No major differences in mast cell density were found between unaffected skin and the centre or edge of individual lesions. Mast cell densities in biopsy specimens from the edge of different lesions on the same patient were also similar, suggesting that the mast cell density within the granulomata is independent of the site of the lesion and is determined systemically.\r"

Using both the conventional histological classification and the Knodell histological activity index it was shown that HIV negative patients were more likely to have active disease and also more scarring than HIV positive patients. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression was not significantly different between the two groups but expression of hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA polymerase was greater in those who were HIV positive. HIV positive patients are therefore more likely to have immunohistochemical markers of active viral replication, although histologically, liver disease is less severe. These findings have important implications for assessing the biopsy specimens in this group of patients and for treatment strategies aimed at improving their immune function.\r"

In the remaining case light microscopical findings seemed to be normal. Two cases examined by electron microscopy showed perisinusoidal fibrosis; in one case this was the only abnormality detected. There is an association between idiopathic portal hypertension and the use of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly thioguanine. Adequate histological examination of liver tissue, including electron microscopic studies, is recommended for patients who develop hepatic problems while receiving cytotoxic treatment to elucidate this problem.\r"

A high grade pleomorphic tumour morphology with plasmacytoid features was seen in 13 tumours. Because of the large number of pleomorphic lymphomas, all tumours were examined for the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus genome using in situ DNA hybridisation. A panel of three biotinylated probes to different sequences in the Epstein-Barr virus genome was used. Positive hybridisation with one or more probes was shown in tumours from 11 patients. The remaining tumours gave no hybridisation signal. There was no correlation between positive hybridisation and morphological subtype or clinical outcome.\r"

Normal cervical tissue obtained from hysterectomy specimens was also assessed. Koilocytes were not immunoreactive for alpha interferon and keratinocyte staining was observed in only four cases of intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV infection alone does not therefore seem to induce the production of alpha interferon in cervical squamous epithelium. There was variable but, in some cases, prominent staining of cells in the stromal inflammatory infiltrate as well as intraepithelial cells which had morphological and immunocytochemical characteristics of Langerhans' cells. Alpha interferon immunoreactivity in Langerhans' cells is in keeping with derivation from the mononuclear phagocyte system and may be important in the host response to HPV infection.\r"

The range of the mean number of nucleolar organiser regions (NORS) per nucleus was 1.54-3.28 (99% CI 2.29-3.04) for tubular adenomas 3.07-4.36 (2.98-4.43), and 3.60-5.02 (3.74-4.69) for villous adenomas with moderate and severe atypia, respectively, and 5.53-9.33 (6.15-8.54) for highly differentiated adenocarcinomas. The number of AgNORs permitted differentiation among the three groups. The differences observed were significant. Malignant tumour cells were characterised by a large number of AgNORs which were small in size and showed a scattered distribution. Nuclei of tubular adenoma and villous adenoma with moderate atypia had only a small number of large sized AgNORs in a clustered distribution. It is suggested that this method distinguishes malignant epithelial cells from benign cells of colon, even those with severe atypia, and that it is a useful adjunct to diagnostic histopathology.\r"

The results on the QM-300 of sera with an initial rheumatoid factor value of less than 400 IU identified two groups. Group 1 (n = 109) showed a good correlation with the ICS-II method while group 2 (n = 13) was highly discordant with the QM-300, producing significantly higher values. The values of 35 sera with an initial rheumatoid factor of greater than 400 IU were likewise highly discordant, with the QM-300 producing significantly lower values. Dilution recovery experiments implied that the Beckman buffer was likely to be contributory. As the formulae of the buffers remain proprietary, the reasons for the differences are speculative. The findings could be taken to indicate that the Kallestad value is a more accurate indicator of the quantity of rheumatoid factor than the Beckman value.\r"

We have found that the anesthetic agent, droperidol-fentanyl, significantly decreased rat synovial vascular permeability after selective synovial mast cell degranulation. In contrast, there was no effect on skin mast cell-induced vascular permeability. To address the possibility that this difference in response represents mast cell heterogeneity and uniqueness of synovial mast cells, we investigated the effects of three different anesthetic agents on synovial mast cells. In these studies we examined whether (1) the drugs affect synovial mast cells and (2) whether the drugs affect synovial mast cells differently from mast cells in skin. Our data indicate that, compared to inhaled methoxyflurane and ethyl ether, subcutaneous droperidol-fentanyl had a significant inhibitory effect on synovial, but not skin, mast cell-mediated vascular permeability, which was associated with a significant inhibition of synovial mast cell histamine release. Thus, the permeability differences were not due only to effects on histamine receptors. Our data suggest the possibility that there are significant functional differences between synovial and skin mast cells, a phenomenon that may have important therapeutic implications for treatment of mast cell-mediated synovial inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined plasma- and eosinophil-derived products in nasal lavage fluids obtained from patients with hay fever during natural allergen exposure. Nine patients with strictly seasonal allergic rhinitis and five normal, nonallergic subjects (control group) were studied. Nasal lavages were performed twice weekly, starting 1 week before the expected birch-pollen season and continuing for 6 weeks, thereby covering the entire birch-pollen season. Nasal symptoms and pollen counts were recorded daily. The lavage fluid was analyzed for it content of albumin, bradykinins, and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). During the pollen season, each of these solutes was significantly increased in the nasal lavage fluid from the allergic patients (p less than 0.05) but not from the control subjects. Albumin, bradykinins, and ECP generally correlated better between themselves than with symptoms and pollen counts. We conclude that natural exposure to allergens induces plasma exudation and increased levels of ECP on the human nasal mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "Late asthmatic reactions have been demonstrated, generally, to increase bronchial responsiveness and are believed to respond poorly to inhaled bronchodilator. To assess the frequency of changes in bronchial responsiveness, we reviewed the records of 101 subjects with late asthmatic reactions and of 63 subjects with isolated immediate reactions after specific inhalation challenges to various occupational agents. These subjects had undergone nonspecific inhalation challenges to histamine or methacholine on a control day and after the late reaction when FEV1 had returned to +/- 10% baseline. We also reviewed 99 cases of subjects with late reactions who were administered an inhaled beta 2-agent (albuterol, 200 micrograms) during the late reaction. Fifty-seven/101 (56%) subjects with late reactions and 24/63 (38%) subjects with isolated immediate reactions demonstrated a twofold or greater change in provocative concentration of histamine or methacholine causing a 20% change in FEV1 (PC20) from baseline (p = 0.02; odds for the presence of significant changes in PC20 in subjects with late reactions, 56%; odds for the absence of significant changes in PC20 in subjects with immediate reactions, 62%). Changes in FEV1 greater than 20% after administering albuterol at the time of the late reactions occurred in 78% of the subjects tested; in 66%, FEV1 returned to greater than 90% baseline. This retrospective study demonstrates that changes in bronchial responsiveness after late reactions are not constant and do not appear to distinguish satisfactorily late from immediate reactions. Furthermore, late reactions respond well to beta 2-agonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A potential relationship between hemodialysis and allergic phenomena prompted us to investigate some allergologic parameters. Total IgE, specific IgE antiethylene oxide and anti-isocyanate toluene diisocyanate, and in vitro spontaneous histamine release (SHR) were measured in 105 long-term stable HD patients. Thirty-two of the patients had occasionally developed skin flush reactions and/or pruritus during dialysis sessions. Blood samples were taken at the start of dialysis, sera were kept frozen until assay, and in vitro SHR was performed on washed leukocytes at 37 degrees C for 40 minutes. A high (range, 20% to 80%) and reproducible in vitro SHR was observed among 24% of patients. No correlation was found between SHR and the type of dialysis membrane used (copolymer of acrylonitrile-methallyl-sodium sulfonate, cuprophan, and polysulfone). High SHR (i.e., greater than 20%) was observed mainly among patients with detectable antiethylene oxide IgE antibodies (p less than 0.001). High levels of IgE (greater than 300 ng/ml), specific IgE antibodies, and a high in vitro SHR were all observed concomitantly in 26% of the patients with skin flush reactions and/or pruritus, whereas all three of these parameters together were present in only 3% of the symptom-free patients. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a high in vitro SHR has been described among HD patients, and putative correlations with in vivo phenomena are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Inhaled antiasthmatic steroids have been assumed and yet never proved to exert their antiasthmatic effect by topical action in the airways. We tested the hypothesis that the efficacy of inhaled budesonide (BUD) might be due instead to its systemic activity after absorption. We compared inhaled and oral BUD with doses selected to ensure higher peak plasma levels and a greater area under the plasma concentration curve with the oral treatment. After pretreatment with beclomethasone to maximize asthma control, 47 adults with asthma were randomized to receive 0.4 mg of inhaled BUD per day (n = 16) or 1.4 mg of oral BUD per day (n = 15), or placebo (n = 16) in double-blind fashion and then followed weekly until asthma relapsed or for 8 weeks if no relapse occurred. \"Relapse\" was defined as a drop in the mean peak expiratory flow rate greater than 2 SEM below the mean during the baseline week before switching to the test drugs. The time to relapse was the primary outcome variable. Time to relapse was longer with inhaled than with oral BUD (medians, 22 versus 7.9 days; p = 0.003) or placebo (medians, 22 versus 9 days; p = 0.004). Oral BUD and placebo did not differ (p = 0.41). The morning serum cortisol levels remained normal during all three treatments. Thus, at conventional dosage the antiasthmatic effect of inhaled BUD may be fully explained by a local intrapulmonary action.\r"

The presumed mechanism of action of these challenges is through mast cell degranulation. We report on the effect of inhaled furosemide on cold-air hyperventilation challenge (CAHC) and methacholine challenge. We studied 10 subjects with mild to moderate asthma in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Inhaled furosemide did not affect FEV1 in the hour after inhalation, and there was no significant difference between placebo or furosemide on the dose of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1. Our results demonstrated inhaled furosemide significantly attenuated the bronchoconstrictive effect at 6 and 9 minutes after CAHC (p less than 0.05 and 0.029, respectively) when furosemide was compared to placebo and approached significance at 12 and 15 minutes after CAHC (p = 0.052 and 0.56, respectively). Inhaled furosemide attenuates CAHC but does not effect methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction.\r"

Early asthmatic reaction was positive for both allergens, and the provocative dose causing a 15% decrease of FEV1 was similar in all seasons. The provocative dose of methacholine causing a 15% decrease of FEV1 and specific IgEs for both allergens were also not significantly different throughout the time of study. Late asthmatic reaction (LAR) to Dermatophagoides occurred in eight of 12 patients in winter, in six of nine in summer, and in five of six patients in autumn. The severity of LAR, expressed as the maximum fall of FEV1 3 to 8 hours after challenge, was not significantly different between seasons. LAR to Parietaria occurred in only one of 12 patients in winter, in six of 11 in summer, and in one of six patients in autumn. In summer, LAR to Parietaria was significantly more severe than in winter. In both winter and autumn, but not in summer, LAR to Dermatophagoides was significantly more severe than to Parietaria. We conclude that LAR is allergen specific, and natural exposure has a priming effect on LAR.\r"

Histamine, peptide LT, and PGD2 levels in BAL fluids increased significantly after antigen stimulation both in patients with asthma and in patients with rhinitis. By contrast, LTB4 concentration was always below the limits of detection of the radioimmunoassay. In patients with asthma, histamine concentration increased from 5.3 +/- 0.6 ng/ml in lavages obtained before provocation to 20.2 +/- 5.8 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.04) 5 minutes after bronchoprovocation. Peptide LTs increased from 0.32 +/- 0.08 to 0.82 +/- 0.21 ng/ml (p less than 0.02) and PGD2 from 0.06 +/- 0.01 ng/ml to 0.36 +/- 0.09 ng/ml (p less than 0.02). Elevated histamine, peptide LT, and PGD2 concentrations were also found in the 15-minute postchallenge BAL fluids. Similar results were obtained in patients with rhinitis. Histamine concentration was 3.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml in prechallenge bronchial lavages and 11.3 +/- 1.7 ng/ml in postchallenge lavages; peptide LTs increased from 0.13 +/- 0.008 ng/ml to 0.73 +/- 0.21 ng/ml, and PGD2 from 0.05 +/- 0.01 ng/ml to 0.26 +/- 0.06 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixteen children, aged 3 1/2 to 7 years, with severe asthma, were treated with budesonide aerosol, 200 micrograms daily, via a spacer for 1 year in an open study. One month after starting budesonide therapy, a significant decrease in the number of days with asthmatic symptomatology, mean symptom scores, use of concomitant antiasthmatic medications, and increase in the peak expiratory flow rates were observed compared with the 1 month run-in period. This improvement was maintained throughout the year with budesonide therapy. During the study period, the height and weight of the children were not significantly deviated from the expected, and their bone age advanced normally. Adrenal function, as evaluated by fasting 8 AM blood cortisol levels and after adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation, demonstrated no adverse effects with budesonide therapy. The suspectibility to severe infections was low, as evidenced by infrequent use of antibiotics. We conclude that a 12-month administration of inhaled budesonide to preschool-age children is safe and efficient and can be useful in the management of severe asthma in this young age group.\r"

Bovine casein, gamma globulin (GG), beta-lactoglobulin, and lactalbumin were the milk proteins used. Antibody production to these proteins were analyzed in 18 patients who underwent milk-protein challenges (eight positive and 10 negative) and in five normal children used in the analysis. ELISA results for specific IgE, IgG, and IgG4 to these specific proteins demonstrated no statistically different response to the four milk proteins among the three patient groups by multivariate analysis. When the specific antibody results from the positive challenge group, the negative challenge group, and the normal group were combined, the IgE and IgG4 to GG and the IgG to casein were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than the corresponding specific antibody to the other proteins tested. The IgG or IgG4 to GG would differentiate the positive from the negative challenge group (p less than 0.05) but were not significantly different from the normal control group. Contrary to previously published studies, these results indicate IgG specific for the milk proteins are not increased in patients with milk-protein intolerance. The data also support the concept that IgE and IgG4 are not elevated in these patients. Therefore, there appears to be no pathogenic role for these specific immunoglobulins in milk-protein intolerance.\r"

However, the 31 kDa major allergen was extracted in about the same amount, either by incubation or by cell breakage of the cells.

We identified 15 children, aged 2 to 6 years, with this defect, and we evaluated their response to immunization with an Hib capsular oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM197 protein-conjugate vaccine (HbOC). The children received a series of three vaccines: HbOC at 0 and 8 weeks, and the Hib polysaccharide vaccine at 16 weeks. Levels of antibody to the Hib capsular polysaccharide (polyribosyl ribitol phosphate, PRP) and to diphtheria toxoid were obtained before and 4 weeks after each vaccination. The geometric mean serum anti-PRP concentration was 0.17 microgram/ml before immunization and 29.3 micrograms/ml after the second HbOC immunization (week 12). All 15 children had postvaccination anti-PRP antibody levels greater than 1.0 microgram/ml after receiving the second HbOC (week 12). In addition, booster responses were observed after the second Hib conjugate in 13 of the patients and after the Hib polysaccharide in four of the patients. All patients with low preimmunization diphtheria titers had a response to the diphtheria toxoid. These results suggest that conjugation of Hib polysaccharide with diphtheria CRM197 overcomes the defective antibody response to Hib oligosaccharide in children who are initially observed with recurrent infections and inability to respond to the Hib polysaccharide vaccine.\r"

Local side effects have been noted in approximately 20% of patients treated and include conjunctival hyperemia, foreign body sensation, and follicular conjunctivitis. We studied five patients with adverse local reactions to dipivefrin (Propine) eye drops. Propine contains the following: dipivefrin, 0.1%; mannitol, 1.89%; sodium metabisulfite, 0.075%; disodium edetate, 0.0127%; and benzalkonium chloride, 0.004%. Since the reactions could conceivably have been caused by an ingredient other than dipivefrin, we first patch tested the patients with the maximum recommended concentration of each ingredient. All patch tests were negative. Sterile ophthalmic solutions of each individual component at the concentrations used in the commercial product were then prepared. In a double-blinded study, the patients applied two drops of each preparation, twice daily for 1 week, with a 1-week, drug-free period between trials. Dipivefrin alone reproduced each patient's initial Propine-induced conjunctivitis; symptoms occurred unilaterally in one patient and bilaterally in the other four patients. This study indicates that testing with single component eye drops can identify the provocative component in ocular drug hypersensitivity and that these reactions can be unilateral.\r"

There were 126 reports associated with the use of these drugs by metered-dose inhaler, which were consistent with a diagnosis of paradoxical bronchospasm. In addition, 58 such reports were received for these drugs delivered as a solution for nebulization between 1983 and 1988. Increased reporting of reactions consistent with paradoxical bronchospasm generally correlated with increased availability of these products during the same time period, although there has not been a steady upward trend in such reports for metered-dose inhalers during the past 3 years, despite increasing distribution figures. Despite the apparent infrequency of inhaler-induced paradoxical bronchospasm, the potentially life-threatening nature of such reactions makes awareness of this possibility essential. Patients who report that an inhaled beta-adrenergic agonist makes their asthma worse, as well as the patients who fail to demonstrate expected improvement with this form of therapy, should be suspected of having developed paradoxical bronchospasm.\r"

Limited evidence suggests similar impairment in the much larger population of older persons with type II diabetes. We report here the results of 13 measures of mental efficiency in persons between 65 and 77 years of age without gross mental impairment. Nineteen persons with type II diabetes were compared with 19 controls with normal glycosylated hemoglobin values and to seven persons not previously known to have diabetes but who had elevated glycosylated hemoglobin. Significant differences (P less than .05) between the nondiabetic control and diabetic groups were noted on eight of the 13 tests. The group of subjects with elevated glycosylated hemoglobins showed levels of cognitive performance intermediate between the normal and known diabetic groups on the majority of tests. These findings confirm that mental efficiency is frequently impaired in older persons with diabetes. Given the high prevalence of diabetes in the aging population we suggest that diabetes may be another important factor contributing to premature loss of cognitive abilities in older people.\r"

  ".W": "Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been associated with improvement in diabetes knowledge and glycemic control in young and middle-aged diabetic patients. This study investigated the influences of SMBG on the quality of life in 20 older diabetic individuals, aged 60 to 79 years with duration of diabetes 15.6 +/- 2.3 (SD) years. Questionnaires (Cronbach's alpha reliability = .93) were administered regarding the impact of four aspects of diabetic self-care--general factors, diet, medications, and monitoring blood or urine--on quality of life. Each category was scored separately. Data were analyzed comparing individuals using SMBG with those monitoring glycosuria. Older patients showed acceptance of SMBG with respect to performance, lack of time consumption, ease of record keeping, and less embarrassment. Individuals performing SMBG reported better medication compliance than those monitoring glycosuria. No differences were observed between the two groups for general factors, diet, or the overall perception of quality of life. Both groups of patients reported that diabetes and performing self-care techniques did not significantly interfere with their life-style. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that self-care techniques, such as SMBG, do not negatively influence the perception of quality of life in older people.\r"

Ninety-three percent of the questionnaires were completed. Nursing questionnaires indicated that over half of patients were restrained during the evening shift. Nurses initiated the use of restraints in 75% of cases. Fifteen percent of the patients' physicians were unaware that the patient had been restrained. In the majority of cases, the nurse and physician believed that restraint was the best alternative for managing the patient although more physicians (11%) than nurses (2%) thought an alternative intervention would be better (P less than .02). As a group, physicians and nurses restrained patients for similar reasons, most often to prevent falls from bed (69%) or to protect medical devices (36%). However, there was poor agreement between the nurse and physician as to the reason for restraint in an individual patient (kappa statistic range from .02 to .43). These findings suggest that nurse and physician communication regarding restraint is poor. We recommend that acute-care hospitals adopt policies to promote communication between nurses and physicians concerning restraints to ensure that use of this potentially hazardous intervention is used only when necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Acute leukemia is more common in older people than in the young or middle-aged. However, the possibilities of achieving remission or prolonging survival are both inversely correlated with increasing age. We studied survival in 118 acute leukemia patients over the age of 64 seen at a university hospital from 1970 to 1987. Seventy percent had myeloid morphology. Median survival times were 106 days in those diagnosed in the 1970s and 71 days for those diagnosed in the 1980s. This was little changed from an earlier series from the same hospital extending back to the 1940s in which median survival was 69 days. Considering the two decades separately, age at diagnosis, sex, race, type of leukemia, and whether or not disease-specific treatment was applied had no significant effect on survival duration. Acute leukemia in the older patient demands difficult medical and ethical choices. Supportive therapy provides immediate comfort and relatively limited morbidity with certainty of death within a few months. Disease-specific therapy causes immediate morbidity for all, shortened life for the majority, and extended life for the minority.\r"

Forty-four of 199 residents had a diarrheal illness; Salmonella heidelberg was isolated from the stool in 19 cases. Although the distribution of cases suggested a common source for the outbreak, no common source of infection could be demonstrated, despite extensive investigation. The clinical presentation of symptomatic individuals ranged from mild diarrhea to a severe gastrointestinal illness, and 26% of symptomatic, culture-positive patients required hospitalization. The median duration of pathogen excretion during convalescence in untreated residents was six weeks, but six patients who were treated with antibiotics shed S. heidelberg for a median duration of 14.5 weeks. We conclude that (1) the clinical spectrum of Salmonella gastroenteritis in nursing-home patients is variable, ranging from mild to severe illness; and (2) nursing-home Salmonella outbreaks impose a high economic burden because of expense of epidemiologic investigation, prolonged isolation measures, hospitalization for severely ill residents, and potential institutional closure.\r"

Both cell lines express high levels of TCR-CD3 complex on the cell surface, but provide different model systems for TCR-CD3 signaling in T cells. Jurkat responds with both inositol phosphate generation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization after triggering of TCR-CD3, whereas TCR-CD3 triggering of HPB-ALL induces Ca2+ mobilization without detectable inositol phosphate generation. By employing a permeabilized cell system, we show that the HPB-ALL line expressed normal levels of Ca2(+)-induced phospholipase C activity. However, the TCR-CD3 on this cell line seems to be uncoupled from phospholipase C activation. In agreement with this result we also show, by analysis of protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of three distinct substrates, that TCR-CD3 in HPB-ALL is apparently uncoupled from protein kinase C activation. These findings may have implications for understanding signal-transducing pathways in T cells at various stages of differentiation.\r"

T cells derived from spleens of B6 mice (Thy-1.2) immune to FBL-3, a Friend virus-induced leukemia, were activated by in vitro stimulation with irradiated FBL-3 and expanded by culture for 14 days with low concentrations of IL-2. The resultant FBL-3-specific T cell lines were adoptively transferred into cyclophosphamide pretreated congenic hosts (B6/Thy-1.1), and restimulated every 14 days by an injection of irradiated FBL-3 plus a 7-day course of IL-2. Donor T cells residing in the host were identified and quantified by use of antibody to the Thy-1.2 allele. The results confirmed that stimulation with FBL-3 on the day of transfer (day 0) plus IL-2 on days 0 to 6 induced rapid growth of donor T cells to approximately an 11-fold increase in total donor T cell number recoverable from host ascites and spleen by day 7. However, prolonging the course of IL-2 administration to 35 days did not maintain the number or the specific cytolytic function of donor T cells. By contrast, intermittent restimulation with specific Ag plus IL-2 induced intermittent regrowth of donor T cells in vivo, maintained the number of donor T cells in vivo at greater than the number input for longer than 1 mo, and allowed detection of substantially augmented donor T cell-mediated specific antitumor function over that period of time.\r"

  ".W": "Human alveolar macrophage have three distinct receptors for IgG: FcRI, FcRII, and FcRIII. In order to compare the ability of these receptors to mediate target cell lysis, three different assay systems were examined. First, we studied lysis of chicken E (CE) opsonized with heteroantibodies, which are synthetic antibodies composed of Fab fragments with anti-FcR activity covalently linked to Fab fragments with anti-CE activity. We found alveolar macrophage readily lysed heteroantibody-opsonized CE via each of the three FcR classes (FcRI, 20 +/- 5%; FcRII, 27 +/- 7%; and FcRIII, 13 +/- 13%, p less than 0.05). Non-FcR-dependent lysis of anti-beta 2-microglobulin x anti-CE heteroantibody-opsonized CE was not detected. Second, lysis of hybridoma cell lines bearing anti-FcR antibodies on their cell surface was examined to assess killing of \"tumor-like\" target cells. Whereas peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes were able to lyse hybridoma cell lines bearing surface anti-FcR mAb, alveolar macrophages were not. Third, activity of alveolar macrophage FcR was examined in a conventional antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay by using O+ (R1,R2) human RBC opsonized with human anti-D and anti-CD serum as target cells. We found lysis of anti-D and anti-CD opsonized human RBC was mediated exclusively via FcRI. No activity of FcRII or FcRIII was detected in these latter assays even if performed under conditions that impair FcRI activity. Thus, all three FcR present on alveolar macrophage mediate lysis of heteroantibody-opsonized CE; in contrast, with the use of a conventional antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay, only FcRI activity was detected. We were unable to demonstrate lysis of anti-FcR-bearing hybridoma cell lines by alveolar macrophages.\r"

This observation suggests that an increase in intracellular calcium free ion concentration [Ca2+]i and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) are sufficient signaling events for the initiation of T cell proliferation. In contrast, an accessory cell-generated costimulatory signal, acting independently of the rise in [Ca2+]i and PKC activation, is required for Ag-induced proliferation of type I T cell clones. We now report that this costimulatory signal is unexpectedly also being delivered via a cell-cell interaction during the response to ionomycin and phorbol ester. In the absence of this signal (at limiting cell numbers), T cells fail to divide. We also demonstrate that proliferation in response to immobilized anti-CD3 mAb requires the cell-cell interaction. These results suggest a model of T cell stimulation in which activation of a costimulatory signaling pathway is important in the regulation of the IL-2 gene, and only in the presence of this (third) signal can an increase in [Ca2+]i and PKC activity induce T cell proliferation. Such a model predicts that IL-2-dependent expansion of T cell clones in vivo in response to Ag receptor occupancy requires the delivery of an independent accessory cell-derived co-stimulatory signal.\r"

Three anti-CD3 mAb (147, 446, 454) each induced cytolytic activity against both K562 and Daudi targets, albeit to different degrees. The differences among the anti-CD3 mAb could not be explained by differences in their isotypes or avidity constants, by the number of anti-CD3 mAb molecules initially bound per cell, or by preferential or differential binding to TCR alpha/beta+ vs TCR gamma/delta+ cells. Each anti-CD3 mAb appeared to induce cytolytic activity via, in part, an IL-2-independent component, as evidenced by: 1) the generation of potent cytolytic activity in mAb 446-stimulated cultures despite undetectable IL-2 levels; 2) the frequent inability of exogenous IL-2 (10 U/ml) to generate as much cytolytic activity as that induced by mAb 147 or 454, despite the low levels of IL-2 (less than U/ml) in the latter cultures; and 3) the different kinetics in generation of cytolytic activity between IL-2 and anti-CD3 mAb. Moreover, exogenous IL-2 enhanced anti-CD3-induced cytolytic activity for each anti-CD3 mAb. However, IL-2-dependent processes also contributed to the generation of cytolytic activity, because anti-p55 IL-2R mAb in combination with anti-p75 IL-2R mAb partially inhibited generation of anti-CD3-induced cytolytic activity, albeit to a lesser degree than the inhibition by these anti-IL-2R mAb of generation of IL-2-induced cytolytic activity. By demonstrating the generation of potent cytolytic activity in the absence of exogenous IL-2, these studies may assist in the development of more effective and less toxic clinical adoptive immunotherapy protocols.\r"

  ".W": "The low reactivity to donor alloantigens reported in PBL from kidney transplant recipients might be related to clonal deletion and/or suppression of donor-specific alloreactive cells. To discriminate between these two hypotheses, we quantified the number of IL-2 secreting cells (IL-2-SC) and of cytotoxic precursors (CTLp) in the T cells from tolerant recipients when stimulated with either donor specific or nonrelated third-party LCL. To eliminate the irrelevant reactivity, we used as responding cells high-density T cells that had been depleted of such reactivity by 4 days preculture with autologous lymphoblastoid cell line in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine. Thus, frequencies of IL-2-SC and CTLp specifically directed at alloantigens could be measured. In 11 recipients, there was no strong decrease in the frequency of donor-reactive T cells when compared to the frequency of those directed at a third-party lymphoblastoid cell line, either for IL-2-SC (tested in 11 patients) or for CTLp (tested in 6 patients). In three cases of seven, a suppression was observed only when T cells were stimulated by donor cells. These data suggest that donor-reactive cells are still present in PBL of kidney-transplant recipients tested from 6 mo to 4 y posttransplantation. Moreover, suppression of donor-specific cells can be demonstrated in peripheral T cells of some recipients, which may account in part for the absence of rejection.\r"

Administration of high dose (10 micrograms/kg) IL-1 beta accelerated the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus compared to saline-injected controls. High dose treatment resulted in goiter development, pronounced LT, reduced serum T4 levels, and overall growth reduction. In contrast, low dose IL-1 beta (0.5 microgram/kg) administration significantly reduced the frequency of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (48%) compared to placebo (86%) and high dose IL-1 beta (93%) treatment groups. Rats protected by low dose IL-1 beta had unaffected growth rates and minimal to no pancreatic and thyroid pathology. Our results demonstrate that exogenous administration of IL-1 beta modulates Biobreeding rat idiopathic autoimmune diabetes and thyroid disease in a dose-dependent manner.\r"

  ".W": "The YAC T cell lymphoma normally does not express Ly-6E mRNA or Ly-6E surface molecules but can be induced to do so on incubation with either IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha/beta. This system afforded a model to assess the possible role of protein kinase C (PKC) in IFN-mediated Ly-6E induction. First, we used various pharmacologic agents known to interfere with the function of PKC or other kinases. The PKC inhibitors H-7 and phloretin were found to block Ly-6E induction by IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha/beta both at the mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases (HA1004), of myosin L chain kinase (ML-9, A-3) or of calmodulin (R24157, W-7) failed to suppress this induction. Next, we investigated the effects of the PKC activators PMA and mezerein (MEZ) on Ly-6E expression. Although neither PMA nor MEZ by themselves could induce Ly-6E in YAC cells, both agents enhanced by up to fivefold the induction of Ly-6 mRNA and Ly-6E surface expression triggered by IFN-gamma. However, the induction of Ly-6E expression caused by IFN-alpha/beta was only marginally increased by cotreatment of YAC cells with PMA or MEZ. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that PKC or a related kinase is involved in the transduction mechanisms that lead to Ly-6E induction. However, activation of PKC is not sufficient for this induction and requires other unidentified signal(s) provided by IFN. Our data also indicate that IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta induce Ly-6E through overlapping but distinct intracellular pathways with different sensitivities to PKC activators.\r"

Our study was undertaken to clarify the hIL-2-responsive lymphocyte subsets in the TGM, which should most likely reflect the normal distribution of m IL-2R beta expression. In both thymus and spleen, the majority of expanded cells by hIL-2 was CD3+CD4-CD8+ TCR alpha beta+ cells. The proliferation of CD4+ cells was not observed at all from either organ despite the expression of transgenic hIL-2R alpha. Potent cellular proliferation was also observed from the thymocytes that had been depleted of CD8+ cells, the expanded cells consisting of CD3- (15-40%) and CD3+ populations (60-85%). Among CD3+ cells, approximately the half portion expressed TCR alpha beta, whereas the other half was suggested to express TCR gamma delta. A variable portion (5-20%) of the CD3+ cells expressed CD8 (Lyt-2) in the absence of Lyt-3, and the CD3+CD8+ cells were confined preferentially to the TCR alpha beta- (TCR gamma delta+) population. In the culture of splenocytes depleted of CD8+ cells, however, the proliferated cells were mostly CD3-CD4-CD8-TCR-Mac1-, whereas a minor portion (10-30%) was CD3+CD4-CD8-TCR alpha beta- (TCR gamma delta+. Analysis of TCR genes at both DNA and mRNA levels confirmed the phenotypical observations. These results strongly suggested that IL-2R beta was constitutively and selectively expressed on the primary murine thymocytes and splenic T and NK cells, except for CD4+ cells in both organs.\r"

In vitro dose-response kinetics data showed that CsA inhibited TNF bioactivity in the supernatant without delaying its production, whereas Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that CsA did not inhibit TNF mRNA expression. We then sought to examine the in vivo effects of CsA (75 mg/kg) in CBA/J mice that were primed with CFA, and injected 2 wk later with LPS. CsA demonstrated suppression of local levels (ascites) of TNF as measured by either bioactivity or an anti-murine TNF ELISA. However, CsA did not decrease mRNA for TNF, or cell-associated TNF. In vivo kinetics studies were performed to show that CsA blocked both local (ascites) and systemic (plasma) LPS-induced TNF production without delaying these effects. CsA inhibited the neutrophilia and lymphopenia that developed after the LPS challenge, but did not block the lung neutrophilic infiltrate. These observations are helpful in understanding the role of the macrophage in CsA immunosuppression, particularly with regard to the ability of CsA to block LPS-induced TNF secretion.\r"

FF SC5b-9 was detectable in all clinical diagnostic categories. The mean SC5b-9 levels in FF and sera were 399 ng/ml (range 75 to 1350 ng/ml) and 798 ng/ml (range 0 to 2700 ng/ml), respectively. Twelve (26.6%) of the 45 FF samples had normal hemolytic C activity, and all FF (n = 44) samples initiated C8/C9-dependent lysis of sensitized sheep E coated with human C1-7. Human plasma IgG antisperm antibodies (ASA) were capable of activating C in 31 (72%) of 43 FF samples as detected by their ability to deposit MC5b-9 on human sperm. Sera from infertile women with ASA in their sera and FF impaired human sperm binding to human zona pellucida and binding and penetration of zona-free hamster oocytes in vitro. The discovery of SC5b-9 and MC5b-9 in ovarian FF implies that the interaction of ASA and C could have a deleterious effect on sperm during in vivo and in vitro sperm-egg interactions in women with antisperm antibodies.\r"

Serum anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies showed heterogeneous spectrotypes. The antibodies isolated from circulating IC had a restricted clonotype and a neutral charge and were directed mainly to ssDNA and, to a lesser extent, to dsDNA. These samples failed to form complexes with DNA when they were subjected to absorption to a DNA-coupled Sepharose column. Anti-DNA antibodies expressed specific Id, termed O-81 or NE-1, which were detected only in the IC of patients with active lupus nephritis. Anti-DNA clonotypes, including O-81 and NE-1 idiotypes, were also found in the eluates of renal glomeruli of lupus patients. These results indicate that subpopulations of anti-DNA antibodies in circulating IC are limited, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.\r"

Anti-La antibodies were raised in 6- to 8-wk-old male MRL(-)+/+, C57BL/6J, BALB/c, and A/J mice by immunizing with authentic human La protein obtained by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. As we have shown previously for human autoantibodies, induced mouse anti-La antibodies reacted with recombinant fusion proteins containing nonoverlapping sequences from different portions of the La molecule. The epitope specificity of antibodies to the middle region of the La Ag was further evaluated using six synthetic La peptides predicted to be antigenic based on their hydrophilic properties. Although the induced mouse anti-La antibodies bound to five of the six synthetic La peptides, human anti-La autoantibodies failed to recognize any of the peptide homologs. These results suggest that mice respond to immunization with human La protein differently than humans who develop autoimmunity to this self Ag.\r"

  ".U": "90237502\r", 
  ".W": "Arginine can be metabolized by inflammatory cells through at least two pathways. One is an oxidative l-arginine deiminase (OAD) that results in the formation of citrulline and reactive nitrogen intermediates. The other is arginase, which determines the production of ornithine and urea. The temporal expression of these pathways in an experimental wound model (s.c. implanted polyvinyl alcohol sponges in the rat) was investigated by examining the concentrations of amino acids and of nitrite in fluids obtained from the sponges 6 h to 15 day after implantation. These analyses revealed two distinct periods during which the arginine concentration in the fluids was markedly below plasma levels. During the early period (less than 3 days after sponge implantation) wound fluid contained more citrulline and nitrite than at any other time, suggesting OAD activity. In contrast, ornithine accumulated in the fluids during the late decrease in arginine concentration that extended beyond day 3, during which time the wound fluid also contained a high arginase activity. This time-dependent expression of different pathways of arginine metabolism in wounds was confirmed in sponge cultures containing [guanido-14C]-l-arginine. Cells contained in sponges harvested less than 48 h after implantation metabolized labeled arginine mainly to labeled citrulline, whereas labeled urea was produced during culture of sponges harvested after this time. The low arginine content of wound fluid did not appear to be rate limiting for the expression of OAD in late sponges because no OAD activity was evidenced when 4 mM arginine was added to the cultures. These results indicate that the OAD pathway is expressed in this model predominantly during the early, polymorphonuclear leukocyte-predominant, phase of repair. At this time, the reactive nitrogen intermediates resulting from the metabolism of arginine may mediate some of the events characteristic of early inflammation, including microbiostasis, vasodilation, and inhibition/reversal of platelet aggregation. In turn, the late suppression of this pathway and the catabolism of arginine through arginase may promote macrophage function within wounds.\r"

  ".W": "The role of IgG4 antibodies in allergic disorders is suspected. Yet, their presence on human basophil membrane has not been demonstrated and the mechanism of the degranulation induced by anti-IgG4 antibodies remains unclear. As previously reported, we observed that monoclonal anti-IgG4 (10 to 100 micrograms/ml) induced histamine release in the presence of D2O from leukocytes of normal and atopic subjects. The release was accompanied by a decrease of the number of toluidine blue-positive basophils (TB+). Histamine release and TB+ decrease were also observed with lower concentrations of anti-IgG4 (1 to 100 pg/ml). Since basophil activation assessed by TB+ decrease was more sensitive than histamine release, we thus used the former method to further study the mechanisms of the anti-IgG4- vs anti-IgE-induced basophil activation. Basophil activation by anti-IgG4 at 1 to 100 pg/ml, but not by anti-IgG4 at 10 to 100 micrograms/ml or anti-IgE, required the presence of polymorphonuclear cells. Furthermore, anti-IgG4-stimulated purified eosinophils, but not neutrophils, released basophil-activating factors identified as cationic proteins from eosinophils. Thus, the human basophil can be activated by anti-IgG4 via two different mechanisms according to the antibody concentration. At high concentrations (10 to 100 micrograms/ml) basophil activation does not require the presence of polymorphonuclear cells whereas at lower concentrations (1 to 100 pg/ml) the presence of eosinophils is necessary. We propose that in the latter concentration range, basophil activation is a two-step process: 1) release by anti-IgG4 of eosinophil cationic proteins that 2) will, in turn, activate human basophils. This study lends support to the role of IgG4 and eosinophils in anaphylactic reactions.\r"

Repeated OVA challenge by aerosol (twice weekly x 4 wk) of previously sensitized guinea pigs produced striking airway hyperresponsiveness as determined by pulmonary resistance changes to increasing doses of inhaled acetylcholine given 3 days after the last OVA challenge. Each OVA challenge produced significant hypoxia that was unaffected by oral pretreatment with 20 mg/kg SDZ 64-412, 2 h before each challenge (pO2 = 35 +/- 2 mm Hg for OVA alone vs 40 +/- 6 mm Hg for SDZ and OVA groups, respectively). SDZ 64-412 pretreatment abolished the airway hyperresponsiveness resulting from repeated Ag challenge. Morphometric analysis revealed that SDZ 64-412 treatment had no effect on the increased numbers of eosinophils that infiltrated the airways of OVA-challenged guinea pigs. These results suggest that PAF may be a primary mediator of airway hyperresponsiveness, but not acute bronchoconstriction, induced by repeated Ag challenge. This activity of PAF appears independent of eosinophil recruitment to airways.\r"

We have investigated the molecular mechanism(s) by which this HIV-1-derived peptide inhibits CD3-mediated signal transduction. We show that the peptide containing residues 581-597 from the HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41 specifically inhibited the intracellular Ca2+ influx in Jurkat cells stimulated by the mAb OKT3 whereas it had no effect on the production of inositol triphosphate. In addition, the peptide inhibited protein kinase C (pkC)-mediated phosphorylation of the CD3 gamma-chain in intact cells and directly inhibited partially purified pkC. The inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to the substrates histone and ATP and independent of the regulatory domain of the enzyme. Furthermore, the peptide required internalization for inhibitory activity because no inhibition of lymphoproliferation was observed when cells were treated with peptide at 4 degrees C. Based on these results obtained with the peptide aa581-597, we postulate that the transmembrane protein gp41 of HIV-1 may inhibit pkC activity and thus block pkC-dependent immune function contributing to the immunosuppression of HIV-1-infected individuals.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified two major proteins in human neutrophils that are phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C (PKC) as lipocortins III and a fragment of a lipocortin-like 68-kDa protein. In electroporated cells, the 68-kDa protein was phosphorylated during stimulation of the cells with either FMLP or PMA. Lipocortins are of interest because of their Ca2(+)- and phospholipid-dependent actin binding properties and ability to inhibit phospholipase A2. Two crude fractions of enzymes and proteins exposed to [gamma-32]PATP in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, phosphatidylserine and 1,2-oleoyl-acetyl-rac-glycerol were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A number of proteins in a detergent-free fraction, including proteins at 36 and 32 kDa, were phosphorylated in the presence of these cofactors. In contrast, only two major proteins (35 and 32 kDa) were phosphorylated in a detergent-extracted fraction. Phosphorylation of the 36, 35, and 32 kDa proteins required the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, and phosphatidylserine in our soluble fraction and detergent extract, indicating PKC-dependent phosphorylation. The 32-kDa protein phosphorylated in both the soluble fraction and detergent extract was identified as lipocortin III by immunoprecipitation with a cross-reactive antibody that recognized lipocortin I and comparison of cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage patterns of this protein with a lipocortin III standard. The 68-kDa protein was identified as a lipocortin VI-like protein by immunoprecipitation with anti-calelectrin. Additionally, the CNBr cleavage pattern of the 68-kDa protein was similar to that of the 36-kDa protein phosphorylated in our soluble fraction. Autoradiograms of the 68- and 36-kDa fragments immunoprecipitated from our soluble fraction with anticalelectrin and cleaved with CNBr showed that both of these proteins were phosphorylated in this sample. Because phosphorylation is known to change the functional characteristics of the lipocortins, the potential exists to link PKC and lipocortins in neutrophils to regulation of granulemembrane interactions or mediation of inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "B220+ T cells from mice that are homozygous for the lpr gene exhibit profound defects in their capacity to produce and respond to IL-2 and provide a cellular model for investigating the basic requirements for effective transmembrane signal transduction in immunologically normal T cells. A correlation between defective lectin-stimulated proliferation and deficient hydrolysis of inositol-containing phospholipids (PI) has recently been demonstrated in B220+ T cells. The finding has been postulated to explain abnormal expression of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in these cells. In a previous study, we found that the constitutive turnover of [3H]arachidonyl-PI was markedly increased in B220+ T cells from lpr-bearing MRL mice relative to that in controls. This observation suggested that an inability to metabolize PI and to generate second messengers putatively necessary for transmembrane signaling might not be responsible for aberrant PKC activity in B220+ T cells. To clarify this issue, the constitutive turnover of phosphoinositides in B220+ T cells from autoimmune-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mice was investigated. We found that in the absence of stimulation with exogenous Ag, B220+ T cells exhibited greatly increased 1) incorporation of labeled myoinositol into PI, 2) production of inositol phosphates in cells prelabeled with [3H]myoinositol, and 3) formation of diacylglycerol in [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled cells. Increased spontaneous PI turnover in B220+ cells was associated with normal phosphatidyl inositol-4,5-biphosphate-phospholipase C activity in membrane homogenates, normal levels of membrane PI, and normal resting and mitogen-stimulated levels of intracellular free-ionized Ca2+. The results suggest that an incomplete form of the PI cycle, one unassociated with PKC activation, is constitutively expressed in B220+ T cells.\r"

  ".U": "90237512\r", 
  ".W": "Our previous skin chamber studies have shown prominent accumulation of viable neutrophils in human allergic skin reaction sites. To determine whether such neutrophils release components that may be pathogenic in allergic reactions, we have compared the patterns of release of five components: 1) lactoferrin, present in specific granules; 2) and 3) elastase and myeloperoxidase, present mainly in azurophilic granules; 4) lactic dehydrogenase, a cytosolic component generally released during cell damage; 5) histamine, present in mast cells and basophils but not in neutrophils. In 13 pollen-sensitive subjects we found that continuous antigen challenge for 5 h lead to a peak of histamine release into overlying skin chambers during the 1st h, followed by a plateau of low level histamine release over the succeeding 4 h. In contrast, there was no significantly increased released of lactoferrin or elastase during the first h, but significantly increased accumulation of these components at Ag challenge sites over the next 4 h. There was no significant difference at Ag vs buffer control sites in the levels of either myeloperoxidase or lactic dehydrogenase. The increased levels of lactoferrin and elastase at antigen challenge sites in the 2nd to 5th h were not simply a reflection of the greater numbers of neutrophils present in such sites because the levels of these components did not correlate significantly with the number of neutrophils in chamber fluids obtained from individual sites. However, such lactoferrin levels did correlate significantly with the amount of histamine released earlier during the 1st h of Ag challenge at individual sites. These findings suggest a selective in vivo release of neutrophil components in IgE-mediated human allergic skin reactions, possibly related in degree to earlier mast cell activation. Inasmuch as lactoferrin likely plays a role in reactive oxidants effects and elastase is a potent nonspecific protease, release of these agents could play a pathogenic role in late phase allergic reactions.\r"

  ".U": "90237513\r", 
  ".W": "Onchocerciasis patients treated with diethylcarbamazine often undergo a severe inflammatory response, the Mazzotti reaction. To assess the eosinophil's role in the pathogenesis of the Mazzotti reaction, we obtained serial blood, plasma, and skin biopsy specimens from 21 heavily infected patients and 3 endemic controls, both before and during therapy with diethylcarbamazine. Samples were analyzed for blood eosinophils, plasma levels of eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, eosinophil infiltration and eosinophil and mast cell degranulation in the skin. After the first dose of diethylcarbamazine, blood eosinophils fell from a pre-treatment level of 888 +/- 111 to 203 +/- 42 cells/mm3 at 8 h. This decrease was followed by a marked eosinophilia developing over the remaining 7 days of treatment and 14 days of follow-up. Plasma eosinophil-derived neurotoxin levels increased from 56 +/- 4 ng/ml pretreatment to a peak of 82 +/- 9 ng/ml at 8 h and returned to pretreatment levels by 48 h. Beginning at 12 h, plasma MBP levels increased from 730 +/- 74 ng/ml pretreatment to a peak of 1140 +/- 74 ng/ml after 5 days. Pretreatment skin biopsies stained for MBP by immunofluorescence showed a bright fibrillar pattern in the dermis consistent with chronic eosinophil degranulation; the MBP was localized on elastic tissue fibers. After treatment, skin biopsy specimens showed both the pretreatment fibrillar MBP staining pattern as well as focal eosinophil degranulation. Deposition of MBP around microfilariae in the papillary dermis was visible as early as 1.5 h. The lowest blood eosinophil levels and peak plasma eosinophil-derived neurotoxin levels coincided with the infiltration and degranulation of eosinophils in the skin. Mast cell degranulation in the skin was maximal by the first posttreatment biopsy (1.5 h) coincident with the beginning of eosinophil degranulation. Although the pathogenesis of the Mazzotti reaction is clearly complex, our results indicate that eosinophil degranulation is characteristic of the response and that it occurs with a time course suggestive of a role for the eosinophil in determining the clinical and pathologic manifestations of the reaction.\r"

  ".U": "90237514\r", 
  ".W": "A prominent feature of parasitic infections is the marked hyperplasia of lymphoid tissues. The resultant disruption of those tissues may be a major cause of the immunodepression that typifies parasitic infections. Trypanosoma musculi infections in mice evoke lymphoid hyperplasia and depressed immune responses. T. musculi infections are more severe in C3H than in C57BL/6 (B6) mice; and more severe in aged mice of either strain, compared with young adults. This report concerns a flow cytometric analysis of splenic leukocytes, identified by various surface Ag, in young and aged, trypanosome-infected mice of C3H and B6 strains. Companion studies included quantification of serum Ig isotypes at intervals during infection. The results support the following conclusions: a) all major types of splenic leukocytes were activated by trypanosome infection resulting in enlargement of the cells and proliferation (\"blastogenic response\"); b) in all young-adult mice and in aged B6 mice (but not aged C3H mice) Thy-1+, Ly-1+, and Ly-4+ cells increased moderately during infection whereas the number of Ly-2+ cells remained constant; c) all cells of the B lineage increased during the course of infection (except in aged C3H mice) with disproportionate increases in the most mature stage (IgG+); d) the responses of young adult C3H and B6 mice to infection differed as illustrated by the ability of B6, but not C3H, mice to limit hyperplasia and reverse the effect; e) aging of B6 mice was reflected by relative inability to regulate generation of mature Ig-producing cells; f) aging of C3H mice was severe as reflected by the relative inability of most subsets of leukocytes to react to the infection, possibly because of abnormalities that were intrinsic in aged, normal C3H mice. It is likely that: a) disruption of lymphoid tissue, probably mediated by alterations in the production of and responsiveness to cytokines, is responsible for the depressed ability of the immune system to defend against parasites; and b) such disruptive effects, being more pronounced in aged animals and less easily brought under control, account for the greater vulnerability of aged animals to parasitic infection.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between immunosuppression and oncogenesis can be determined by studying the molecular interactions between tumor-inducing viruses and lymphocytes. We approached this study by using a unique system of two genetically related Leporipoxviruses, malignant fibroma virus (MV), and Shope fibroma virus (SFV). MV induces a syndrome of a highly lethal, disseminated myxosarcoma, severe immune suppression, and replicates in lymphocytes both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, SFV causes a benign fibromyxosarcoma without immune dysfunction and cannot replicate in lymphocytes. Earlier studies demonstrated that transfer of a 10.8-kb Bam HI piece of MV (fragment \"C\") to SFV resulted in the ability of SFV to replicate in lymphocytes and suppress immune function. These results suggested that lymphocytotropic replication and immune suppression was located on the left side of fragment C. We extended these studies by generating families of recombinants between MV and SFV by using subfragments of fragment C. The resulting recombinant viruses were analyzed for their ability to replicate in lymphocytes, suppress immune function, and produce tumors. Those recombinants expressing MV-like characteristics were mapped by endonuclease digestion. This study demonstrates that recombinants containing a 3.6-kb Nde I subfragment, as well as those containing an overlapping 1.9-kb Hinc II subfragment, were capable of replicating in lymphocytes, suppressing immune functions, and inducing disseminated tumors in rabbits. Our study has therefore identified a portion of MV DNA sufficient to transfer the unique pathogenicity of MV to SFV, and suggests that control of immune suppression and tumor dissemination may not necessarily be mediated by the same viral genes.\r"

  ".W": "Regulatory mechanisms governing B cell responses to the trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) molecule currently are being studied. As a fundamental basis for examining such regulation, the epitope specificities and idiotypic profiles of murine mAb produced to the VSG of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense clone LouTat 1.5 were determined. Variant specific mAb were used to probe VSG proteolytic peptides in Western blot analysis, to serve as competitive inhibitors in RIA analyses with purified VSG molecules, and to examine membrane-binding patterns of labeled trypanosome cells in order to evaluate epitope specificities. By using these approaches, a conformational epitope expressed only on the VSG 1.5 surface coat of viable trypanosomes was detected, and two nonconformationally determined epitope clusters were recognized within the subsurface V region of the VSG 1.5 molecule. The subsurface epitope clusters may be repeated on the VSG molecule because each was present on more than one proteolytic VSG peptide fragment. Idiotypic profiles of selected VSG-specific mAb subsequently were determined with xenogeneic antiidiotypic typing sera. Results from competitive inhibition RIA analyses using these reagents demonstrated that varying levels of idiotypic cross-reactivity exist among the subsurface VSG epitope-specific mAb; this cross-reactivity extended to idiotope(s) expressed by a mAb recognizing a surface conformational epitope of the VSG 1.5 molecule. Analysis of complementary idiotypic/antiidiotypic antibody pairs revealed that these specific interactions were inhibited by purified VSG 1.5 but not by purified VSG 1.9, which was derived from a heterologous variant antigenic type. The model mAb described here, and reagents recognizing their idiotypic markers, comprise a foundation for analysis of idiotypic regulation of VSG-specific B cell responses during infection.\r"

  ".W": "The current study examines the idiotypic expression and regulation of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)-specific B cell responses during African trypanosomiasis. Utilizing competitive inhibition RIA analysis, we detected antibodies in the serum of BALB/cByJ mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense clone LouTat 1.5 that recognized the same VSG epitopes as three VSG 1.5-specific mAb. These epitope-specific antibody responses were detectable by day 5 of infection, peaked by day 10, and then declined slowly through day 15 of infection. VSG-specific antibodies detectable in the serum of infected BALB/cByJ mice included those that were idiotypically cross-reactive with the VSG 1.5-specific mAb. These idiotypically defined, VSG-specific antibody responses appeared to peak around day 7 of infection, but then declined to near preimmune levels by day 15 of infection, demonstrating that the aggregate epitope-specific response was composed only in part by the idiotypically cross-reactive responses. Although corresponding antiidiotypic antibodies could not be detected in infected sera during periods of up- or down-regulation of idiotypically defined antibodies, flow cytometry analysis of lymphocytes isolated from the spleens of LouTat 1.5-infected BALB/cByJ mice revealed the presence of antiidiotypic receptor-bearing cells. These cells were detectable primarily during days 10 to 12 of infection and subsequently down-regulated their receptors, or declined in numbers, to near preimmune levels by day 15 of infection. The appearance of these antiidiotypic receptor-bearing cells coincides with the decline of idiotypic antibody present in the serum of the LouTat 1.5-infected mice and may represent nascent evidence for idiotypic regulation of trypanosome-specific immune responses in infected animals.\r"

  ".W": "HLA-B27 subtype polymorphism is amenable to differential recognition by CTL. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct a series of HLA-B27 mutants reproducing most of the changes occurring in the natural subtypes. The reactivity of 21 anti-HLA-B27 CTL clones was examined with these mutants to address three issues concerning the alloreactive response against HLA-B27: 1) diversity of clonotypic specificities, 2) structural features of the epitopes recognized by these clones, and 3) role of individual positions in the differential recognition of HLA-B27 subtypes. Virtually all CTL clones displayed unique reaction patterns with the mutants, indicating a corresponding diversity of epitopes. However, these share some molecular features, such as certain amino acid residues and related locations. Individual mutations induced complex effects on multiple B27-specific CTL epitopes, revealing some of their very precise stereochemical constrains. An important feature of HLA-B27 subtype polymorphism is that every individual change was relevant, altering recognition by many CTL clones. Although the specific set affected by each mutation was partially different, the global number of clones affected by most changes was very similar. This suggests that the antigenic profile of any given subtype is not dominated by one particular change but is uniquely defined by its corresponding set of changes. An exception was the change at position 152, which totally abrogated recognition by all 20 anti-B*2705 CTL clones. This effect decisively influences the profound differences in T cell recognition between B*2705 and the two subtypes, B*2704 and B*2706, carrying this change. The results are compatible with the idea that HLA-B27 allorecognition may involve multiple peptides bound to the alloantigen on the cell surface.\r"

Recombinant E. coli cells produced two forms of a human IgG Fc-binding protein, one with an apparent Mr of 42 kDa in a periplasmic fraction and the other with an apparent Mr of 45 kDa in a mixed fraction of cytoplasms and membranes. Both 42-kDa and 45-kDa protein preparations similarly bound to human IgG1 to IgG4, human IgG Fc, and rabbit IgG, but not to IgG of mouse, rat, bovine, sheep, goat, and human IgA, IgD, IgE, and IgM. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned 1.8-kb DNA fragment was determined. An open reading frame encoded a hypothetical protein of 376 amino acid residues (Mr = 42,498). The N-terminal amino acid sequence, consisting of 41 residues, which was removed post-translationally had typical characteristics of Gram-positive bacterial signal peptides. Thus, the mature form of protein H was suggested to consist of 335 residues (Mr = 38,162). There were 3 repeated sequences consisting of 42 residues that were highly homologous to those of protein Arp, an IgA-binding streptococcal cell wall protein, and streptococcal M6 and M24 proteins. The C-terminal amino acid sequence consisting of 93 residues, directly following the repeated sequences, was also highly homologous to that of M6 and M24 proteins. No sequence homology was found between protein H and protein A or protein G, two other IgG-binding bacterial cell wall proteins.\r"

In order to effectively utilize HC antibodies in an immunotherapy protocol, methods must be identified for the optimum expansion, activation, and retargeting of lymphocyte-effector populations from cancer patients. In this study, we have compared the proliferative responses of different normal and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patient lymphocyte preparations (PBL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) stimulated in vitro for periods up to 12 days with a variety of growth factor combinations (anti-CD3, rIL-2, rIL-4). These activated lymphocyte preparations were then tested in vitro for their ability to kill RCC tumor cells and tumor cell lines in the presence of HC preparations (anti-CD3 mAb covalently linked to mAb reactive to different RCC tumor-associated Ag). RCC patient PBL cultured with anti-CD3 plus rIL-2 for 12 days resulted in a 3- to 160-fold expansion of effector cells. These cells, as well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, when retargeted with appropriate HC antibodies were capable of mediating high levels of killing of autologous tumor cells. No constitutive autologous anti-tumor cell response was detected in the absence of added HC antibodies. Of the five anti-RCC mAb tested (A6H, K29, K20, UR07, and URO 3), HC containing URO 3 x anti-CD3 and K20 x anti-CD3 elicited the highest level of tumor cell lysis by the activated lymphocyte effector cells. Together these results demonstrate that HC antibodies may be a useful imunotherapeutic reagent for directing the killing of RCC tumor cells by autologous lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Th cells are stimulated by peptide Ag presented in the context of MHC class II molecules. We have reasoned that immune responses against tumors may be more efficient if tumor cells were class II Ag positive, and thereby able to directly function as APC to stimulate tumor-specific Th cell proliferation. We have tested this hypothesis by using DNA-mediated gene transfer to generate syngeneic MHC class II Ag-expressing mouse Sal sarcoma cells (Sal/Ak transfectants). Autologous A/J mice challenged i.p. or s.c. with Sal/Ak transfectants do not develop tumors, whereas A/J mice challenged with the class II negative parental Sal tumor have a high tumor incidence. Furthermore, immunization of the autologous host with Sal/Ak transfectants completely protects against subsequent challenge with wild-type Sal cells. MHC class II-expressing tumor cells, therefore, stimulate an improved tumor-specific immune response, and the immunity is cross-reactive with the class II negative tumor. Inasmuch as the transfected MHC class II gene product is not functioning as a target molecule for autologous tumor rejection, the improved immunogenicity of the Sal/Ak cells is probably due to stimulation of a tumor-specific Th cell population. The increased immunogenicity of Sal/Ak cells is, therefore, probably the result of direct presentation of Sal tumor-associated Ag in the context of tumor cell MHC class II molecules to Th lymphocytes. These studies demonstrate that induction of tumor cell MHC class II Ag expression is a potential strategy for tumor-specific immunotherapy, and suggest that tumor immunity may be enhanced by improved Th cell generation.\r"

A total of 388 follicles was aspirated at settings of vacuum pressure of 100, 75, and 50 mm Hg. Parthenogenesis occurred at the rates of 5.9, 7, and 1%, respectively. The difference between 100 and 50 mm Hg was statistically significant (P less than 0.025). We conclude that the rate of parthenogenesis is influenced by the magnitude of vacuum pressure.\r"

  ".W": "A high incidence of fertilization failure has been reported in men with over 70% of their sperm bound with isoantibodies. In three men with greater than 80% antisperm antibody binding with IgG and IgA immunoglobulins, a normal rate of fertilization (29/46 oocytes; 63%) was achieved by adding a sufficient number of motile sperm to provide at least 50,000 unbound sperm per oocyte. This method appears to be simpler and more effective than attempting to separate unbound sperm in vitro.\r"
