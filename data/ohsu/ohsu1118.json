Successful intervention depends on identification, however, and nondisclosure can be a problem. This randomized study compared rates of disclosure with two response formats--multiple choice, in which the patient is able to describe herself as having \"cut down,\" and the usual history question, \"Do you smoke?,\" in which she is forced to answer simply \"yes\" or \"no\". Each format was tested in both oral and written channels with a multiethnic adult prenatal population (n = 1078) entering care in a multispecialty group. Study results indicate that the multiple choice question improved disclosure, regardless of channel (oral versus written), by 40%. This effect was observed across racial and ethnic groups. Biochemical tests of urine samples from reported nonsmokers indicated smoking in only 3%. Eleven percent of the \"nonsmokers\" in the experimental groups refused consent for the urine test, however, and many of these were probably smokers.\r"

Major basic protein has been localized to placental trophoblasts known as X cells. Because X cells are located in placental septa and septal cysts, we tested whether the numbers of these structures are correlated with plasma levels of major basic protein. Data analysis revealed strong positive correlations between maternal plasma major basic protein concentrations and the number of placental septa, septal cysts, and subchorial cysts and the presence of subchorial fibrin deposits. No significant correlation was found between plasma major basic protein levels and other variables examined, such as placental weight. Thus major basic protein is a specific marker for septa and cysts, presumably because it is an X-cell product. The study of major basic protein may aid in delineating the function and ontogeny of X cells, as well as their role in fibrin deposition and in septa and cyst formation.\r"

On the fifth day of tocolysis, edema developed in the right labium majus pudendi and gradually spread to the left labia during the ensuing 24 hours. The patient remained afebrile, normotensive, and without signs of localized infection or anasarca. A trial of triple intravenous antibiotics and local skin care proved ineffective. By the ninth hospital day, the edema and discomfort had progressed, thereby precluding vaginal examination without sedation. In spite of progressive cervical dilatation with tocolysis, cesarean delivery was performed. With no further treatment, the vulvar edema gradually resolved during the next week.\r"

Although a reduced incidence of preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes has been reported in women who had antepartum uterine activity monitoring, there are few data regarding uterine activity after preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes. Therefore daily uterine activity monitoring was performed in 101 consecutive women with preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation. The mean gestational ages at rupture and delivery were 31.4 +/- 2.3 and 33.7 +/- 4.5 weeks, respectively. A significant increase in contraction frequency was identified within 24 hours of onset of preterm labor (p less than 0.005). A contraction frequency of four or more per hour predicted the onset of labor within 24 hours with a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 54%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. These results indicate that most women with preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes exhibit a baseline contraction frequency that is similar to that of women with intact membranes and premature labor. An abrupt increase in contraction frequency is a warning of impending labor.\r"

This is due to limited knowledge of the reproductive toxicologic effects of industrial agents, lack of safety standards aimed at protecting the fetus, and limitations in assessing the extent of exposure. The approach to this subject taken by the Motherisk Program and a review of the three most common occupational exposures are presented. Epidemiologic studies and measurements of radiation do not suggest a reproductive hazard for video display terminals. Exposure to organic solvents is hard to quantitate, and information is sparse and sometimes contradictory, and therapeutic decisions are difficult to reach. To date there is no convincing evidence that working with organic solvents within safety regulations would harm a fetus, in contradistinction to detrimental fetal effects of solvent abuse. The reproductive risks of lead are well documented, fetal exposure can be assessed, and effective treatment exists, but its effects on the pregnancy have not been fully established. However, new evidence suggests that maternal levels that are much lower than the accepted adult limits may be damaging to the fetus.\r"

There were significant decreases in sound pressure levels with increasing frequencies (p less than 0.0001) and increasing depth (p = 0.01). There was no significant interaction between these two variables. An electronic artificial larynx was also activated on the abdominal wall, resulting in quite high sound pressure levels (mean, 119 dB) measured 5 cm from the surface, with a significant decrease in sound pressure levels as the thickness of the intervening maternal tissues increased (p = 0.005). These results suggest that the frequency of vibratory stimulus used and the thickness of the maternal abdominal wall could influence fetal response to the vibroacoustic stimulation test by affecting intrauterine sound pressure levels.\r"

Some physicians have questioned if failure rates are due to an incompatibility between bipolar forceps and bipolar generators of different manufacturers. This manuscript presents data on tissue desiccations performed on a rat uterine horn model that uses two bipolar forceps of quite different designs and two popular bipolar generators. The data demonstrate that if an appropriate amount of energy, between 100 and 117 J, is applied to the tissue, consistent destruction occurs, regardless of the generator-forceps combination used. Histologic examination of the desiccated uterine horns displayed complete occlusion of all samples 8 weeks after the procedure. However, immediately and at 3 weeks after the procedure patent uterine horns were found. In the patent samples most samples displayed considerable electrosurgical damage.\r"

Fetal arterial blood pressure and umbilical venous pressure were measured in eight sheep, 3 to 5 days after surgery. Umbilical blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter around the common umbilical vein. Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms were obtained either by an indwelling 5 MHz pulsed Doppler device (n = 4) or transcutaneously by a 4 MHz continuous-wave Doppler device (n = 4). Fetal blood pressure was raised by intravenous infusion of norepinephrine 10 micrograms/min during 5 minutes. Norepinephrine infusion resulted in elevated arterial and umbilical venous pressures, accompanied by a bradycardia during the first 3 minutes. Umbilical blood flow, calculated placental vascular resistance, and umbilical artery pulsatility index did not change. After atropine administration, the norepinephrine-induced elevated arterial and umbilical venous pressures were accompanied by tachycardia, increased umbilical blood flow, and no change in placental vascular resistance and umbilical artery pulsatility index. It is concluded that fetal arterial hypertension provoked by norepinephrine infusion has no effect on placental vascular resistance, umbilical blood flow, and umbilical artery pulsatility index.\r"

After the contractile activity was greater than two to three contractions every 10 minutes, beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid1-[D-Trp2,Phe3,Ile4,Arg8]-oxytocin, a novel oxytocin antagonist produced in our laboratories, was given simultaneously with the oxytocin for 90 minutes. Contractile force (frequency x mean amplitude) was determined for 30 minutes before and for three 30-minute intervals after the oxytocin antagonist was administered. Animals at 140 days' gestation showed a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in contractile force in the first 30-minute interval after oxytocin antagonist infusion was initiated, whereas those at days 156 and 169 showed decreases (p less than 0.05) at the second 30-minute interval. In addition, in late gestation a higher dose of oxytocin antagonist per unit of oxytocin was required to prevent uterine contractions. In conclusion, these results suggest (1) that an oxytocin antagonist can inhibit oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in the pregnant baboon and (2) that the interval from oxytocin antagonist administration to significant inhibition of uterine contractions appears to increase with advancing gestational age.\r"

The rationale for this study was to provide another test for our hypothesis that genes linked to the major histocompatibility complex are responsible for the diseases in the index couples. If they are, these genes should segregate with a higher frequency in the relatives of the index couples than in the relatives of normally fertile couples and lead to a higher prevalence of these diseases in the extended families. Such a difference was found and adds support to our hypothesis that major histocompatibility complex-linked genes affect growth, development, and susceptibility to cancer.\r"

These studies test the hypothesis that this diminution is due to decreased production of neutrophilic growth factors, reduced responsiveness of neutrophil progenitors to these factors, or the presence of an inhibitor. While the concentrations of placentally derived colony-stimulating factors were similar in normotensive and hypertensive gestations, bioassay demonstrated less colony-stimulating activity in placental conditioned media from hypertensive gestations. Evaluation of the responsiveness of progenitors to recombinant factors revealed no differences between those from normotensive and hypertensive gestations. However, neutrophilic colony formation in vitro was significantly inhibited after the addition of conditioned media or sera from hypertensive gestations, whereas the addition of these from normotensive gestations had no inhibitory effect. Thus this common maternal-fetal disorder is associated with an inhibitor of neutrophil production, which is elaborated by the placenta and present in cord blood serum.\r"

On rigid bronchoscopy no foreign body, or anatomical obstruction was seen, but airway obstruction recurred during emergence from general anaesthesia, and was thought to be functional in nature. A recurring airway obstruction followed, relieved by induction of anaesthesia and by sedation. This was subsequently demonstrated to be caused by a tortuous aorta which impinged intermittently on the anterior tracheal wall, as a result of kyphoscoliosis of the thoracic spine. We attribute the relief of airway obstruction by general anaesthesia to a reduction in arterial blood pressure.\r"

Arterial pressure was measured directly and left ventricular diameters were determined by transoesophageal echocardiography. Systolic blood pressure after propofol and thiopentone and the end-systolic quotient (systolic pressure/end-systolic diameter), a measure of inotropy, decreased. Fractional shortening (end-diastolic-end-systolic diameter/end-diastolic diameter) decreased only in the thiopentone group. Diastolic blood pressure and end-diastolic diameter (a measure of preload) did not change in any of the groups, and the etomidate group showed no changes in the haemodynamic variables measured. Propofol shows simultaneous negative inotropy and afterload reduction, while thiopentone is exclusively negatively inotropic.\r"

PATIENTS: A total of 122 patients with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral emboli and an equal number of age- and sex-matched control patients. MEASUREMENTS: Evaluation using transesophageal echocardiography was done in case patients to detect protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta and in control patients for cardiac indications other than emboli. MAIN RESULTS: Matched logistic regression showed that the presence of protruding atheromas was strongly related to the occurrence of embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% Cl, 1.6 to 6.5; P less than 0.001). Furthermore, atheromas with mobile components were present only in case patients. When known risk factors for stroke (hypertension and diabetes) were added to the model, the presence of protruding atheromas remained an independent risk factor for embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 3.8). Hypertension was also independently associated with embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 2.7), but diabetes was not (odds ratio, 1.0). CONCLUSION: Protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta can be detected by transesophageal echocardiography and should be considered as a cause of strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and peripheral emboli.\r"

DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Adults admitted to the hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS: Using stepwise logistic regression, we analyzed prognostic factors (data available at admission and recorded in the medical record) that showed a univariate association with mortality. The predictive values of three discriminant rules were measured to validate the results of a previous study. MAIN RESULTS: Of 245 patients, 20 (8.2%) died. Of 42 prognostic factors identified in previous studies, 8 were associated with mortality, but only a respiratory rate of 30/min or more, a diastolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg or less, and a blood urea nitrogen of more than 7 mmol/L remained predictive in the multivariate analysis. A discriminant rule composed of these three variables was 70% sensitive and 84% specific in predicting mortality, yielding an overall accuracy of 82%. CONCLUSION: Tachypnea, diastolic hypotension, and an elevated blood urea nitrogen were independently associated with death from pneumonia in our study, confirming the value of a previously reported discriminant rule from the British Thoracic Society. This rule may be useful in triage decisions because it identifies high-risk patients who may benefit from special medical attention.\r"

DESIGN: Case-series analysis. A cohort of 45 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was followed prospectively by periodic telephone interviews and medical examinations for an average of 14 months after onset of illness. SETTING: Washington state. PATIENTS: The cases of 47 patients were reported to the Washington State Department of Health from 1 July to 12 December 1989. Two patients were unavailable for follow-up, and the remaining 45 completed the study. MAIN RESULTS: Patients were predominantly non-Hispanic white women (87%) with an average age of 49 years. Symptoms typically progressed from early onset of myalgia and fatigue to later development of neurologic and scleroderma-like skin changes. Six (13%) patients recovered completely within 2 to 5 months of symptom onset. After 14 months of illness, over half of the patients who initially presented with myalgia, fatigue, or scleroderma-like skin changes remained symptomatic. The average severity of each major symptom was measured using interviews and patient self-reports and has improved subjectively by at least 40%. Statistical analyses showed no significant difference in long-term symptom duration or severity between patients treated and those not treated with prednisone. CONCLUSIONS: The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a long-term illness characterized by progressive improvement during the first 25 weeks after symptom onset, followed by a protracted phase of symptom resolution. We could not show a clear-cut benefit of prednisone in reducing the long-term severity or duration of the disease.\r"

DESIGN: Hemoglobin oxygen saturation data collected prospectively by use of pulse oximetry with concurrent review of the medical record. SETTING: General medical-surgical nursing units in a large, tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty patients on two nursing units monitored with continuous, bedside pulse oximetry at the request of their primary physicians. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had continuous pulse oximetry monitoring. A research associate visited the bedside two or three times daily and recorded saturation compared with time data from the previous 8.75 hours. Patients were studied for 36 hours or until pulse oximetry monitoring was discontinued. Episodes of desaturation were counted. Patient charts were reviewed for documentation of desaturation in either nursing or physician notes. Orders adjusting oxygen therapy or other respiratory therapy within 12 hours of any desaturation episode were also recorded. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty of the 40 patients (75%) had at least one episode of desaturation to less than 90%; 23 (58%) had at least one episode to less than 85%. Desaturation episodes were documented in nursing notes for only 33% of those patients who desaturated to less than 90% and in physician notes in only 7% of cases. Changes in respiratory therapy were ordered in 20% of patients who desaturated to less than 90% and in only 26% who desaturated to less than 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their repeated occurrence, episodes of hypoxemia were rarely documented in either nursing or physician notes. Further, even in patients who had episodic desaturation, pulse oximetry monitoring had little effect on changes in physician-directed respiratory care.\r"

  ".U": "91336557\r", 
  ".W": "Sepsis and its sequelae (sepsis syndrome and septic shock) are increasingly common and are still potentially lethal diagnoses. Many mediators of the pathogenesis of sepsis have recently been described. These include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukins, platelet activating factor, leukotrienes, thromboxane A2, and activators of the complement cascade. Neutrophil and platelet activation may also play a role. Other agents that may participate in the sepsis cascade include adhesion molecules, kinins, thrombin, myocardial depressant substance, beta-endorphin, and heat shock proteins. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor and endothelin-1 are released from the endothelium and seem to exert a regulatory effect, counterbalancing each other. A central mediator of sepsis does not seem to exist, although TNF alpha has been commonly proposed for this role. Animal studies are difficult to extrapolate to the clinical setting because of cross-species differences and variations in experimental design. Rather than being caused by any single pathogenic mechanism, it is more likely that sepsis is related to the state of activation of the target cell, the nearby presence of other mediators, and the ability of the target cell to release other mediators. Also important is the downregulation or negative feedback of these mediators or the generation of natural inflammation inhibitors, such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-8. Endothelial damage in sepsis probably results from persistent and repetitive inflammatory insults. Eventually, these insults produce sufficient damage that downregulation can no longer occur; this leads to a state of metabolic anarchy in which the body can no longer control its own inflammatory response.\r"

In our article, we define patient-centered interviewing and provide a rationale for using it.

Furthermore, our knowledge is now sufficient to support a substantial investment of funds in improving what physicians now do in medical practice and in developing publicly available standards of medical practice. Such standards or guidelines could be used by both physicians and patients as part of an explicit process to assess the medical appropriateness of expensive or dangerous procedures before they are done. In addition, the competence with which care is delivered also needs to be measured. Both of these assessments should be used prospectively by physicians to help patients choose the referral source that will maximize their preferences.\r"

In the second experiment, we sprayed the nasopharynx of 10 chinchillas with CT. Of these, 8 developed both pharyngitis and AOM, and in 6, live CT was cultured from the middle ear and pharynx. In the third experiment, 5 chinchillas had their conjunctiva inoculated with CT. Three developed CT conjunctivitis. Of these, 2 developed CT pharyngitis and 1 developed CT AOM.

Isometric force responses of the pars recta and pars oblique muscles were obtained electronically with a dual servo system (ergometer).

  ".W": "To better understand the role of immunocompetent cells in the defense mechanism of the upper respiratory tract against microbial invasions, the distribution patterns of those cells were investigated in nasal mucosa of mice maintained in three different conditions: germ-free (GF), specific pathogen-free (SPF), and conventional (CV) conditions. Immunostaining by the indirect peroxidase method and toluidine blue staining were employed for the detection of immunocompetent cells and mast cells. For immunostaining, anti-IgG, -IgA, and -IgM polyclonal antibodies and anti-Lyt-1, -Lyt-2, and -Mac-1 monoclonal antibodies were used as primary antibodies. In nasal mucosa of CV mice, Mac-1+ cells, mast cells, and all cell types of lymphocyte subsets were present. In nasal mucosa of SPF mice, all cell types were also positive, but fewer in number than those of CV mice. In nasal mucosa of GF mice, IgG+, IgA+, and Lyt-2+ cells were rare, although IgM+ and Lyt-1+ cells were present in small numbers. An electron microscopic study revealed that follicle-like lymphocyte aggregates with high endothelial venules were present in nasal mucosa close to the mucosal epithelia. These findings suggest that lymphocytes are mobilized to nasal mucosa, responding to continuous antigenic stimuli, and play an important role in the local defense mechanism of the upper respiratory tract.\r"

The opening becomes inadequate and the patient is uncomfortable and panicky. A secondary plastic operation is necessary in order to improve the airway, or a laryngectomy tube must be worn constantly. I have developed a satisfactory technique for tailoring the tracheostome during total laryngectomy so as to minimize postoperative stenosis even in irradiated cases and allow the patient to dispense with the laryngectomy tube. It may render the posterosuperior wall of the tracheostome more suitable for a tracheoesophageal puncture tract for voice restoration after total laryngectomy. These goals are achieved by interdigitating a small skin-thick superiorly based apron flap, raised from the lower midline of the front of the neck, into a similar recipient area at the upper posterior tracheal wall after removal of an equal mucosal apron.\r"

The tablets were administered three times daily for 8 weeks. Every week the patients stated the severity of tinnitus on a number scale from 0 to 10. The levels of zinc and albumin in serum were determined both before and after treatment. Of 48 patients with tinnitus, hypozincemia was found in only one patient. The zinc level increased significantly in the patients treated with zinc. We could not demonstrate any beneficial effect from zinc on tinnitus. One of the essential reasons for this finding could be that the zinc levels in serum were in the normal range previous to treatment.\r"

These small spindle-shaped cells are found in clusters oriented in a rostrocaudal, dorsoventral or lateromedial direction. The CNs have a cleft nucleus, with the majority of nerve terminals contacting the CN near the emergence of polar dendrites. Polarization of the afferent synaptic profiles suggests a bidirectional nature of inputs to CNs by the vestibular nerve, contralateral CNs, and/or cerebellar systems. One type of labeled cell does not conform to this pattern, instead resembling a vestibulo-ocular neuron. Hence, it may function as a commissural and a vestibulo-ocular neuron. Characterization of different types of synapses, based on the size and eccentricity of their synaptic vesicles, indicates a continuum rather than separate populations. Volume fraction of intracellular organelles showed a larger volume fraction percent of polyribosomes in larger cells. Since this organelle is involved with protein synthesis, this finding may indicate that larger CNs have a more extensive dendritic tree.\r"

The purpose of our study was to document and quantify middle ear pressure equalization failure during simulated dives among diving candidates who had otherwise met the otologic criteria for diving fitness. Forty-two candidates for regular naval diving activity were included in the study. Tympanograms of both ears at 1 and 1.1 absolute atmospheres (ATA) were taken inside a pressure chamber with the subjects in two positions: seated and supine. At a pressure of 1 ATA, type A tympanograms were found in all 84 ears examined. At a pressure of 1.1 ATA, with subjects in the upright position, 19 (22.9%) of the ears had type C and 2 (2.4%) type B tympanograms, while with subjects recumbent during descent, 6 of the ears (7.2%) had type C and 7 (8.4%) type B. Our results suggest that successful autoinflation at surface ambient pressure does not necessarily reflect middle ear pressure equalization ability during descent in a dive.\r"

  ".W": "An excised canine larynx was used to assess the effects of glottic width and vocal fold tension on acoustic power, aerodynamic power, and vocal efficiency. Multiple regression analysis of the data obtained from 10 larynges revealed that with increased vocal fold tension there is a logarithmic decline in radiated acoustic power, while aerodynamic power remains constant (p less than .05). Vocal efficiency has a similar logarithmic decrease with increased tension (p less than .05). With narrowing of the glottis, the acoustic power increases more than the aerodynamic power delivered to the larynx, and the efficiency increases. The inverse relationships glottic width has with acoustic power and vocal efficiency are best described by a reciprocal model (p less than .01). There is a negative linear relationship between glottic width and aerodynamic power. These results suggest that within the larynx the energy conversion is regulated by glottic aperture and longitudinal vocal fold tension. The optimal width for efficiency appears to be the narrowest width that produces phonation within the modal register, whereas increased tension decreases the efficiency of the glottis.\r"

Results of the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and videofluoroscopy examinations were compared for presence or absence of abnormal events. Good agreement was found, especially for the finding of aspiration (90% agreement). The FEES was then measured against the videofluoroscopy study for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Sensitivity was 0.88 or greater for three of the four parameters measured. Specificity was lower overall, but was still 0.92 for detection of aspiration. It was concluded that the FEES is a valid and valuable tool for evaluating oropharyngeal dysphagia. Some specific patients and conditions that lend themselves to this procedure are discussed.\r"

New Mexicare would be set up within the State Medicaid Division and would be predicated on a mandate that all employers must provide health insurance with reasonable cost sharing by higher paid employees. It would not have great fiscal impact on small businesses, require complicated new tax rules, or impact current state revenues. New Mexicare solves the problem of the uninsured in incremental fashion and does not create an enormous administrative or budgetary burden to the state. It may be a suitable model for other states that share New Mexico's demography. New Mexicare could easily and rapidly be dissolved in the event that the federal government finally acts and provides universal access with some type of national plan.\r"

Studies of adults with prolonged cough have found that 20% to 25% have serologic evidence of recent pertussis infection. Investigations of outbreaks have documented that adults develop infection with Bordetella pertussis and transmit the organism to susceptible children. Adults are the major reservoir of infection for children who may develop severe illness. Pediatric health care workers and patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus might be at higher risk than the general population. Because most adults are susceptible to pertussis, physicians must consider pertussis in the differential diagnosis of patients with prolonged cough. Physicians who care for adults should be active in the diagnosis and treatment of pertussis, supportive of studies of the epidemiology of pertussis in adults, and interested in the development and testing of new diagnostic and preventive measures.\r"

The greater rate of poverty with its associated socioenvironmental problems, increased barriers to health care, and importation of infectious diseases endemic in the mother country are some of the major reasons that probably account for this disparity in disease burden in Hispanics. This formidable health problem can be addressed by targeting efforts at improving health education of family units and communities, environmental improvements, elimination or reduction of barriers to health care management and disease prevention, and appropriate screening programs. A comprehensive and uniform assessment of the impact of infectious diseases on Hispanics (and other minorities) in this country remains elusive, but is of paramount importance in establishing priorities and effective/efficient strategies to address this issue.\r"

Cure was seen in eight (26%). Improved blood pressure was obtained in 12 patients (39%), and in 11 patients (35%), the result for blood pressure was a failure. The accuracies of the two mathematical models used to analyze the renal vein renin assays were 44% and 60%. The captopril test showed a sensitivity of 36% and an accuracy of 43%. Renal captopril technetium Tc 99m-labeled pentetic acid scintigraphy gave a sensitivity of 60%. Stepwise logistic regression analysis of clinical variables in relation to blood pressure response revealed age as the only factor significantly related to blood pressure outcome. We conclude that the tests used are unfit for helping select patients for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and that age may have an important influence on outcome.\r"

Most physicians in both surveys believe that treatment costs should not play a role in medical decisions. Trainees in 1988 were more aggressive in their management of case studies than were faculty in 1988 or trainees in 1981. While in both years the most important factors in the decision to treat aggressively were a patient's expressed desire to live or die and the amount of patient suffering, physicians in 1988 ranked malpractice concerns as a more important determinant in their decision process compared with physicians in 1981. Significant changes in physician attitudes toward the care of critically ill patients have occurred during this decade.\r"

DESIGN.--Prospective clinical case study. SETTING.--Urban county hospital. PATIENTS.--One hundred ten consecutive patients with esophageal symptoms and documented human immunodeficiency virus infection. INTERVENTION.--Blind brushing of the esophagus via orogastric tube followed by endoscopy with esophageal brushing for fungal stain, Papanicolau smear, and viral cultures and esophageal biopsies for histologic examination and viral culture. MAIN RESULTS.--Seventy-two (65%) of the 110 patients had a total of 100 esophageal infections. Thirty-three (30%) had Candida alone, 22 (20%) had Candida and cytomegalovirus, two (1.8%) had Candida with cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus, seven (6%) had cytomegalovirus alone, six (5%) had herpes simplex virus alone, and two (1.8%) had both viruses. Fifty of 55 patients with plaques alone had Candida, and two (4%) had only viral infection. Of 19 patients with erosions or ulcers, 11 (58%) had a viral infection, two (11%) had Candida alone, and six (30%) had no etiologic agent identified. The sensitivity of endoscopic brushings (95%) was better than that of histologic examination (70%) in the diagnosis of Candida esophagitis. Likewise, viral cultures of brushings or biopsy specimens were more sensitive (67%) than histologic examination (35%) for viral esophagitis. Blind brushing of the esophagus had a sensitivity and specificity for infectious esophagitis of 84% and 75%, respectively. Oral thrush had a sensitivity of 53% and a positive predictive value of 77% for Candida esophagitis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: We wanted to determine the clinical and biochemical effects of long-term therapy with the somatostatin analog octreotide in 189 acromegalic patients. METHODS: Patients were treated at 23 medical centers for 6 days to 231 weeks (median, 24.2 weeks) with varying octreotide dosages (100 to 1500 micrograms/d; median, 300 micrograms/d). Serum growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations before and at the end of the study were compared, and correlations between the response to treatment with total daily dosage and duration of treatment were sought. RESULTS: The clinical response rate was 88%, irrespective of dosage or treatment duration. Serum growth hormone levels decreased in 172 (94%) of 182 patients and IGF-I levels decreased in 91 (92%) of 99. The mean pretreatment growth hormone level was 39.4 +/- 4.4 micrograms/L and decreased to 12.2 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L. Growth hormone levels decreased to less than 5 micrograms/L in 82 (45%) of 182 patients. The pretreatment IGF-I level was 5.62 +/- 0.41 U/mL and decreased to 2.64 +/- 0.19 U/mL; suppression to 2 U/mL or lower occurred in 46 (46%) of 99 patients. The degree of growth hormone suppression was associated with longer treatment duration but not with the total octreotide dosage per day. In 34 patients studied prospectively, pituitary tumor size decreased by greater than 20% in 15 (44%). Side effects occurred in 37% of patients and were most commonly transient loose alcoholic stools, pain at the injection site, and abdominal discomfort; severity was mild to moderate. Glucose tolerance was unchanged or improved in 52% and declined in 48% of 25 patients evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Octreotide is an effective treatment for acromegaly that may be used as primary therapy or after surgery and/or pituitary irradiation.\r"

We previously reported a higher incidence of endobronchial involvement in adults with lower lung field tuberculosis (LLFTB). We evaluated the value of roentgenographic and fiberbronchoscopic findings in predicting the outcome of adults with LLFTB after 9 months of antituberculosis chemotherapy. The most common change on chest roentgenograms among 101 patients with LLFTB was consolidation, followed by cavitary lesion, lung collapse, and solitary mass. Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy (hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy) was found in 12 cases. Sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli was positive in 64 patients, and sputum culture for tuberculous bacilli was positive in 37 of 50 patients. Endobronchial involvement was found in 45 of 63 patients who underwent fiberbronchoscopic examination. Of these 45, 18 had ulcerative granuloma, 12 had fibrostenosis, eight had submucosal infiltration, and seven had mucosal redness and swelling. A higher incidence of endobronchial involvement was found in the patients with LLFTB when they presented with roentgenographic findings of pulmonary consolidation, lung collapse, or associated intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. The outcome seemed unfavorable in the patients with LLFTB who presented with roentgenographic findings of lung collapse or pulmonary consolidation, or in those who presented with fiberbronchoscopic findings of fibrostenosis or ulcerative granuloma. Our results show that roentgenographic and fiberbronchoscopic findings are of value in predicting outcome of patients with LLFTB. With proper antituberculosis chemotherapy and close follow-up, fiberbronchoscopy may be clinically indicated in patients with LLFTB to assess the presence and severity of endobronchial involvement. Early surgical intervention can be considered in those with severe endobronchial involvement before serious sequelae occur.\r"

This placebo-controlled, parallel study compared psyllium with methylcellulose, calcium polycarbophil, and placebo as dietary adjuncts in treating mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. Of 163 men and women recruited with serum cholesterol levels above 5.17 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), 105 completed 8 weeks of an American Heart Association step I diet and then augmented the diet with one of the fiber supplements for 8 additional weeks. Incremental differences from placebo for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were -8.8% for psyllium, -3.2% for methylcellulose (not significant), and +8.7% for calcium polycarbophil; and for total cholesterol the differences were -4.3% for psyllium (not significant), -1.4% for methylcellulose (not significant), and +5.9% for calcium polycarbophil. Compliance was 94% to 96%, and only mild gastrointestinal side effects were observed. In managing mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia, methylcellulose and calcium polycarbophil provide little or no additional benefit, while psyllium significantly enhances the American Heart Association diet effects.\r"

The lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglyceride levels were consistent for both Cuban and non-Cuban Hispanics. There were higher waist-hip ratios and insulin levels in both Hispanic men and women. When allowances were made for these attributes in covariance analyses, the lipid differences were markedly diminished. These data suggest the lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglyceride levels are consistent across Hispanic subgroups and that this lipid pattern may be attributable at least in part to increased insulin resistance in Hispanics.\r"

Dizzy patients were younger (mean ages, 47 vs 56 years, respectively), more often female (75% vs 42%), and more likely to be assigned a psychiatric diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified young age and rotatory dizziness (vertigo) to be associated with a psychiatric diagnosis. Dizziness and syncope frequently coexist and in many cases may represent the same pathophysiologic process. A careful dizziness history may guide the initial evaluation of syncope patients in clinical practice.\r"

Patients with acromegaly had a 2.45-fold increased rate of malignant tumors (95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 5.04) compared with findings from the tumor registry. Female patients had a higher rate than male patients. The rate of carcinoma of the thyroid was excessive and previously underscribed, but the rate of carcinoma of the colon was not increased as reported by others. Among benign lesions, goiters, predominantly nodular, were seen in 25% of patients in addition to a large number of mesenchymal lesions.\r"

After 7 years, 74% of vaccinees retained antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels of 10 mIU/mL or more. Anti-HBs levels at 7 years varied inversely with age and directly with the level of anti-HBs attained 1 year after the first dose. During the 7 years after the first dose of vaccine, five vaccine responders and three other persons developed antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and their level of anti-HBs increased. None developed detectable hepatitis B surface antigen or clinical hepatitis. This update of an ongoing study continues to suggest that the risk of hepatitis B virus infection to most persons with an initial anti-HBs response to hepatitis B virus vaccine of 10 mIU/mL or greater is low, regardless of the initial antibody level.\r"

Even with the advent of newer antihypertensive agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists, the centrally acting sympatholytics (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists) remain a valuable group of medications for the management of hypertension of all grades of severity. Their advantages include efficacy; rarity of contraindication; absence of most metabolic and serious side effects; favorable effects on systemic hemodynamics; lack of true tolerance and infrequency of volume expansion-related pseudotolerance; suitability in the elderly, in isolated systolic hypertension, and in patients with various concomitant conditions, such as diabetes mellitus; ability to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy; and relative low cost. The long duration of action of guanfacine hydrochloride, the most recently marketed agent, and of the transdermal formulation of clonidine is an especially commendable feature. The principal disadvantages of this class of medications are an overlap between the therapeutic dosage and that producing sedation and dry mouth and the potential to cause the discontinuation syndrome and sexual dysfunction.\r"

A large part of this increase was due to new legal requirements, which ensure that manufacturers report reactions to the Food and Drug Administration. Most reaction reports originated with practicing physicians who contacted drug manufacturers. High proportions of the reports involved new drugs and serious reactions. Reaction surveillance leads to 50 to 100 important safety investigations annually and to numerous changes in product information. Health care providers must continue to report suspect adverse reactions to the Food and Drug Administration and manufacturers if pharmaceutical use and safety are to improve.\r"

Four patients presented with sinus, pulmonary, and renal involvement. One patient initially treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim developed worsening renal function requiring cytotoxic therapy. Two patients initially treated with cytotoxic agents achieved remission coincident with the addition of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for persistent sinus symptoms. One patient had relapse of pulmonary symptoms after achieving and maintaining a remission during treatment with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim alone.

We present two patients who developed signs and symptoms of angle closure glaucoma after receiving aerosolized atropine for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Treatment with therapeutic levels of a tricyclic antidepressant did not bring relief of symptoms. In one case, months after treatment and subsequent improvement of vitamin D status and pain, the vitamin D status again declined and the pain recurred. The pain again resolved with vitamin D replacement and improvement of levels. There may be a pain syndrome associated with vitamin D depletion that appears as hyperesthesia worsened by light, superficial pressure or even small increments of movement.

Despite strong gains in the 1970s in increasing the number of black trainees and graduates, the proportion of minorities in medicine now is declining in relation to the total population. The paper discusses this situation, changes in U.S. minority populations, factors that affected the attempt to achieve parity in medicine, the current status of minorities in medical training (including educational debt) and on medical faculties, and remedies for institutions' lack of success in achieving parity. Three successful programs are described, as are the broader social issues that underlie academic medicine's attempt to increase the proportion of minorities in medicine.\r"

Over the last six years, the consortium has established a multifaceted, statewide effort aimed at increasing the pool of qualified minority applicants. The programs include academic enrichment for precollege and college students, recruitment conferences, and a program to attract minority applicants to residency training in New York. The key to this effort is the work of the AMS Office of Minority Affairs, which provides statewide oversight and coordinates these programs. The consortium approach has proven attractive to both private philanthropy and government funding sources and provides a mechanism for evaluation. The most valid evaluation will occur in about three years, when graduates of the precollege program begin to apply to medical school.\r"

The development team envisioned that these goals would be met by means of well-crafted teaching units that could be evaluated and, if acceptable, used by academic pharmacologists in their teaching. The units were developed, edited, reviewed by experts, and field-tested with students at the authors' schools; editing and publication were done by the study's sponsor, the Upjohn Company. The results of the field trials (which indicated no need for revisions of the units) showed that the units were well crafted and that the students had higher scores on tests of their knowledge of pharmacology after they had used the units.\r"

The present study has explored how the partnership program is supposed to work, whether in reality it does work, what function it actually serves, and under what circumstances it operates best. In 1986 and 1987, the authors analyzed information from formal school documents, created and used questionnaires for the students and faculty, conducted semistructured interviews with selected students, and used the results of an annual survey, begun in 1978, of supervisors of first-year students who graduated from UMKC. The students and docents were found to favor the partnership system and reported that most partnerships worked well. The system's chief outcome is seen to be teaching teamwork: learning from and working together with student partners. The characteristics of the students, docents, and setting that contributed to successful partnerships are identified. The authors conclude that the partnership system at UMKC does achieve its objectives, which are described.\r"

Thirty-seven students (9.7%) interrupted their progress through medical school for negative (school-initiated, academic) reasons or neutral (student-initiated, nonacademic, or personal) reasons.

The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire, recently validated in Spanish, was used to measure the students' anxiety associated with the examinations. In addition, analog scales were used to obtain the students' assessment of each examination's difficulty and its importance to them. The findings showed different levels of anxiety in examinations of different subject matters, with a positive correlation between the importance attributed to the examination and the associated anxiety, and a negative correlation between the importance of the examination and the importance attributed to chance in the marking. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.\r"

During the academic years 1983-84, 1984-85, and 1985-86, the Department of Internal Medicine of the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago conducted 12-week junior clerkships at six hospital sites. The study analyzed the 535 students' subjective grades, clerkship examination scores, final grades, and National Board of Medical Examiners Part I (NBME-I) scores. Although students' performances as characterized by subjective evaluations did not improve as the academic year progressed, mean scores on clerkship examinations improved steadily during the same period. The site of the clerkship, whether a community-affiliated hospital or a medical center hospital, affected neither subjective nor objective grades.\r"

Specific topic areas were grouped into five scales. Perceived knowledge of these topics significantly increased (p less than .0001) in all areas except nutritional biochemistry. There was significantly less (p less than .0001) interest in learning more about nutrition. One major exception was that the physicians wanted to learn more about nutrition counseling. Another exception was that nutrition in the life cycle remained an area about which they wanted to learn more. The physicians rated nutritional skills as less relevant on the second questionnaire than on the first. The authors conclude that more emphasis on nutrition counseling skills and nutrition in the life cycle may be appropriate in medical education.\r"

The residents were most likely to negotiate with the attending physician and least likely to ignore the attending physician or withdraw from the case for all scenarios, though the type of procedure affected the decision. The residents planning careers in general medicine or nonmedical specialties were more likely to agree with the attending physician than were the residents planning medicine subspecialty careers (p less than .005); the graduates from osteopathic schools were more likely to withdraw from the case than were the residents from allopathic schools (p = .05). Conflicts between the residents and attending physicians were resolved by negotiation and interaction with the attending physicians, but the nature of the procedure, medical school attended, and future career plans affected the means of resolving the dilemma chosen by the individual resident.\r"

  ".W": "A nonpharmacological approach in the treatment of mild hypertension is often advocated. In an attempt to decrease sodium and increase potassium intake, sixty-two middle-aged patients with mild hypertension were given a potassium loaded ion-exchanging sodium-adsorbing potassium-releasing seaweed preparation (seaweed fiber, SF). The mean blood pressure (MBP), evaluated in a double-blind crossover manner with four weeks familiarization and wash-out periods, showed a significant decrease after four weeks on 12 and 24 g/day SF but not on 6 g/day or placebo treatment. Systolic blood pressure during submaximal exercise decreased on all three SF doses. The decrease in MBP appeared to be significantly higher in sodium-sensitive (11.2 mm Hg, P less than .001) than in sodium-insensitive (5.7 mm Hg, P less than .05) patients and was in salt-sensitive patients significantly correlated to the increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). The urinary sodium excretion decreased, the urinary potassium increased and the sodium/potassium urinary excretion ratio decreased, indicating that the decrease of MBP was dependent on the decreased intestinal absorption of sodium and increased absorption of potassium released from the seaweed preparation. A sodium-potassium ion-exchanging seaweed preparation is an effective means of decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake, and may be used for antihypertensive treatment in mild hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Low doses of exogenous dopamine (3 micrograms/kg/min) were administered intravenously to nine patients with essential hypertension and to six age-matched healthy volunteers. During infusion with dopamine, mean arterial blood pressure decreased in hypertensive patients whereas it did not change in normotensive subjects. Basal levels of sodium excretion were comparable in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The natriuretic response to dopamine was significantly greater in hypertensive patients. Urinary and nephrogenous cAMP significantly increased in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The increase of nephrogenous cAMP was more pronounced in hypertensive patients than in normotensive controls. A significant correlation was found between nephrogenous cAMP and sodium excretion. The enhanced natriuretic response to dopamine in hypertensive patients may be due to increased cAMP formation in response to tubular dopamine receptor stimulation. This is in agreement with the hypothesis of either up-regulation or affinity changes of renal dopamine receptors in patients with essential hypertension, secondary to a decreased endogenous production of intrarenal dopamine.\r"

Both treatments significantly (P less than .001) lowered blood pressure, reducing systemic vascular resistances. After 3 months both drugs induced a comparable percentage of reduction in LV mass, with an increase in the peak rate of LV relaxation and no changes in the peak rate of LV contraction. Our results demonstrate that perindopril once daily is an effective antihypertensive agent; it is also able, like captopril, to induce regression of LV hypertrophy, with improvement in diastolic performance and no deterioration in ventricular systolic function.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the role of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin system for pressure induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 135 rats with experimental supravalvular aortic stenosis (AS). We induced this condition by a silver clip on the ascending aorta, when body weight (BW) was 90 to 100 g. Sympathectomy by 6-OH-dopamine reduced LV norepinephrine content to less than 5%. The renin-angiotensin system was blocked by quinapril, which reduced serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity to less than 5%. Aortic stenosis (LV peak systolic pressure 212 +/- 10 mm Hg) induced significant LVH with an increase of LV weight from 198 +/- 3 (sham) to 266 +/- 6 after 6 weeks and to 303 +/- 13 mg/100 g body weight after 12 weeks. Sympathectomy did not reduce LVH 6 weeks after induction of AS (260 +/- 6 mg/100 g body weight). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition initiated immediately after induction of AS did not alter the increase of LV mass after 6 weeks (250 +/- 7 mg/100 g body weight). Removing the silver clip 6 weeks after induction of AS resulted in a 90% regression of LVH after 6 more weeks. When ACE-inhibition was started after 6 weeks--ie, once LVH had developed--and maintained for another 6 weeks, an 80% regression of LVH was observed despite the persistent afterload elevation. Our findings of an afterload independent regression of LVH by ACE-inhibition emphasize an important role of the renin angiotensin system for the maintenance of pressure induced LVH.\r"

The results showed that the average diastolic pressure declined with PRA, particularly in men under 45 (95 to 89; P less than .05), but that among the men 45 and older there was a strong, positive relationship between awake diastolic pressure variability and the level of PRA (p less than .001). These results may have important clinical implications since both higher PRA and greater blood pressure variability have been associated with a greater cardiovascular disease risk.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between determinants of blood viscosity and blood pressure (BP) variables was studied in a large sample of a population aged 25 to 64 years. Plasma viscosity, hemoglobin, and total serum protein were examined. Systolic and diastolic BP and the prevalence of hypertension showed a crude positive association with plasma viscosity levels in both sexes. Age, body mass index, and total serum protein appeared to have a confounding effect on this relationship, whereas hemoglobin, smoking behavior, and alcohol consumption did not. A crude positive association was also found between total serum protein levels and the prevalence of hypertension in men and women; however, since total serum protein was treated as a covariable, no further analyses were carried out. In contrast to findings reported in the literature, hemoglobin levels were not correlated with BP variables in either sex. After adjusting for all confounders, a significant main effect of plasma viscosity still was found. However, the magnitude of the effect was not as large as for body mass index, a well-established risk variable for hypertension. These results indicate that BP is positively associated with plasma viscosity. Whether increased plasma viscosity in hypertension constitutes a primary or a secondary phenomenon remains to be answered. Since plasma viscosity is significantly associated with hypertension but any BP variable, increased levels of plasma proteins (particularly fibrinogen as the main determinant of plasma viscosity) may represent the cause for elevated plasma viscosity. This might contribute to persistently increased resistance to blood flow on the microcirculatory level in arterial hypertension.\r"

Accordingly, in the present study we evaluated the possibility that exaggerated vascular reactivity responses in obese Zucker rats may result from insulin resistance and a consequent failure of insulin to attenuate vasoactive responses. Thoracic aortae were isolated from male 16 week old lean and obese Zucker rats, and replicate helical strips from each animal were suspended in a muscle bath under a resting tension of 1.4 g in the presence or absence of insulin (0.1 mU/mL) for 1 h. The insulin was then washed out, and vascular reactivity responses to phenylephrine were determined. The obese rats exhibited greater reactivity to phenylephrine (ED50:1.10 +/- 90 X 10(-8) v 7.57 +/- 0.88 X 10(-10) mol/L in lean and obese rats, respectively, P less than .025). Insulin caused a significant attenuation of the contractile response in both the lean and obese aortae. However, lean rats exhibited a markedly greater attenuation than the obese rats (46.0 +/- 17.0 v 17.8 +/- 7.5% attenuation in the lean and obese rats, respectively, P less than .01). These data suggest that increased vascular reactivity responses in obese Zucker rats may result from their insulin resistant state and, consequently, a diminished ability of insulin to attenuate vasoconstrictor responses.\r"

Incubation of purified platelets loaded with fura-2-AM in media containing 1.5 mmol/L Ca2+ resulted in higher basal [Ca2+]i than platelets incubated in Ca(2+)-free media. In addition, vasopressin-induced platelet [Ca2+]i transients were almost completely blocked by Ca2+ channel blockers. Thus, in contrast to VSMC, the transmembranous flux of extracellular Ca2+ is the major mechanism in vasopressin-induced increases in platelet [Ca2+]i, while mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores is only minimally involved.\r"

Recent technical improvements including color flow Doppler allow its application to practically all vascular beds in the body. Duplex is noninvasive and in many areas its accuracy in the detection of arterial stenosis and occlusion rivals angiography. Duplex ultrasound has become the preferred method of evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. It provides information about the degree of stenosis, location of disease, and plaque characterization, and in many cases replaces standard cerebral arteriography. Duplex ultrasound has been used to detect renal artery stenosis in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension with an accuracy of 93% in the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant stenosis. It also has important applications in the assessment of mesenteric artery stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, and venous disease. Because it is accurate, reasonably inexpensive, and noninvasive, duplex ultrasound can be used to follow the progression of untreated atherosclerotic lesions throughout the body. Used in this fashion, it provides important information about the natural history of atherosclerotic lesions, their clinical prognosis, and the effect of interventions, either medical or surgical, on lesions.\r"

It is becoming increasingly evident that salt sensitive individuals are especially likely to be characterized by abnormalities of calcium metabolism and blood pressure responses to dietary calcium. In this review the role of calcium in the regulation of blood pressure is examined with an emphasis on epidemiological, biochemical, hemodynamic and dietary intervention data in the salt sensitive hypertensive patient.\r"

In this investigation serum concentrations of CGRP were measured in patients with untreated mild to moderate essential hypertension (WHO I-II) and compared with concentrations in sex- and age-matched normal controls to assess a possible relationship between changes in concentrations of CGRP and this condition. The study showed no significant difference in concentrations of CGRP between patients and the normotensive controls. However, a weak but significant positive correlation was found between systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean blood pressures (MBP), and circulating concentrations of CGRP when calculated for all individuals included in the study. No correlation was found between heart rates (HR) and concentrations of CGRP. In the normotensive control group, but not in patients with hypertension, a significant positive correlation was present between body weights and concentrations of CGRP. These findings do not support the hypothesis that low expression of CGRP plays a causal role in essential hypertension, but the results do not exclude a potential receptor defect for CGRP to be involved in the disease.\r"

The age-matched (36 +/- 5 years) control group with negative family histories of hypertension was subdivided into two groups, one matched for body mass index (BMI) to the subjects with positive family histories of hypertension (n = 10), and another lean control group (n = 11). Baseline blood pressure was significantly higher in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension and in controls matched for BMI as compared with lean controls. Sodium excretion increased in all three groups during the saline infusion, while subjects with positive family histories of hypertension disclosed a diminished natriuretic response as compared with the two control groups. Systolic blood pressure increased significantly during the saline load in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension, while in subjects with negative family histories of hypertension, no significant change in blood pressure was observed. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, serum aldosterone, plasma noradrenaline, blood volume, and ouabain-sensitive erythrocyte sodium efflux rate constant did not differ between the three groups at baseline. A significant negative correlation was found between baseline sodium excretion and sodium efflux rate constant in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension. We conclude that the subjects with positive family histories of hypertension exhibit a blunted natriuretic and an exaggerated blood pressure response to an acute saline load as compared with the two control groups with negative family histories of hypertension. This could be of neuronal and/or hormonal origin.\r"

Average daytime systolic blood pressure (r = 0.41, P less than .001), diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.38, P less than .001), male gender (r = 0.49, P less than .001), and age (r = 0.32, P less than .001) were univariate correlates of LV mass index as measured by M-mode echocardiography. In a stepwise multiple regression model, male gender, age, and systolic blood pressure were independent predictors of LV mass index. LV filling rate normalized to mitral stroke volume, a Doppler-derived index of diastolic filling, was inversely related to age (r = -0.47, P less than .001), heart rate (r = -0.27, P less than .01), LV mass index (r = -0.32, P less than .001), and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.20, P less than .05). Age, heart rate, and LV mass index were predictors of normalized peak filling in a stepwise regression model. Race was not significantly related to either LV mass index or diastolic filling. Our results confirm the importance of demographic variables as well as blood pressure in determining LV mass and filling characteristics in humans prior to the development of sustained essential hypertension. These variables contribute to ventricular mass and diastolic function in varying degrees. Gender is strongly correlated with LV mass, but not with filling indices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis of pressor responses to the rate of NE infusion showed that the high salt diet sensitized subjects so that they needed less NE to raise systolic blood pressure (SBP) 20 mm Hg (P = .005). There was a complex interaction of salt intake, black race, and hypertension on NE pressor sensitivity (P = .03). Hypertensives attained lower plasma NE levels during the stepwise NE infusion, so we reanalyzed NE sensitivity in terms of the changes in plasma NE levels. This analysis also showed that during the high salt diet, subjects initiated a pressor response at lower plasma NE levels (P = .017) and raised SBP 20 mm Hg at lower NE levels (P = .007). The reanalysis showed that hypertensives initiated a pressor response at lower plasma NE levels (P = .03) and raised SBP 20 mm Hg at lower NE levels (P = .002). Plasma NE levels should provide a better guide to the concentration of NE at cardiovascular receptors than the rate of NE infusion. Analysis of pressor responses to plasma NE levels demonstrated that the hypertensives had an exaggerated pressor response to NE.\r"

Since insulin resistant states are also generally salt-sensitive and dietary Ca2+ reduces blood pressure in some salt-sensitive states, we evaluated the effects of dietary Ca2+ on blood pressure and vascular reactivity and examined whether these effects are due to increased vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ efflux. We assigned 16 obese and 16 lean rats to a normal (0.5%) or high (1.5%) Ca2+ diet for 28 days, following which intraarterial blood pressure and in vitro vascular smooth muscle 45Ca efflux and vascular reactivity responses to phenylephrine and serotonin were measured. Blood pressure was elevated in the obese rats on both diets (P less than 0.2), and the high calcium diet lowered both systolic and diastolic pressure in both the lean and obese rats (P less than 0.5). Vascular reactivity was higher in the obese rats (P less than 0.2), but dietary Ca2+ exerted opposite effects on vascular reactivity to the agonists. High Ca2+ reduced sensitivity to serotonin in the obese rats by 54% (P less than .05) without affecting sensitivity in the lean rats. In contrast, the high Ca2+ diet increased sensitivity to phenylephrine by 31% in both groups (P less than .01). 45Ca efflux was lower in the obese rats compared to the lean rats (P less than .05), and the high Ca2+ diet increased this rate by 23% in the lean, but not the obese, rats (P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nonparallel effects of renin inhibitor treatment on plasma renin activity (PRA) and the plasma levels of angiotensins (ANG), as well as on blood pressure, have been observed in subjects with hypertension. This study addresses the possibility that renin inhibitors may show a high degree of plasma protein binding in vivo and that displacement of protein-bound inhibitor during the assay of PRA in vitro may lead to overestimation of renin inhibition. Indeed, with the ultrafiltration technique it was found that 96% of the novel renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892, when added to EDTA plasma, was bound to protein. The angiotensinase inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 8-hydroxy-quinoline sulfate (8-OHQ), which are currently used in PRA assays, caused a displacement of protein-bound inhibitor, thereby increasing its free concentration. This displacement was sufficient to explain the reduction in IC 50 of Ro 42-5892, which was seen in the PRA assay when PMSF and 8-OHQ were added to plasma. Such reductions in IC 50 were also seen with the renin inhibitors CGP 29-287, CGP 38-560A, and SR 43-845. When Ro 42-5892 was given, 1 mg/kg intravenously in 10 min, to subjects with hypertension, it appeared that plasma ANG I and II returned to baseline after 6-8 h, whereas PRA measured in the presence of PMSF and 8-OHQ was still suppressed. However, when PRA was measured without these angiotensinase inhibitors, the inhibition of PRA was parallel to the suppression of ANG I and II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypertension (HTN) and proteinuria (Up) are the hallmarks of this immunologic allograft response. Over 1 year, 23 patients posttransplantation and with HTN (diastolic greater than 95 mm Hg) were examined. Serial serum creatinine (Scr), Up, urine creatinine (Ucr), and resting and enalapril challenged (EC) plasma renin activity (PRA) were all determined. Renal artery stenosis was excluded by noninvasive imaging. Of the 23 patients, eight eventually lost their renal allografts, while 15 maintained satisfactory renal function (Scr less than 2.5). Results of this study show that: 1) worsening renal function (RF) increases EC reactivity; 2) the presence of proteinuria is not itself related to increase in EC activity; 3) renin before and after EC was higher (P = .06) in the allograft loss group. In this study, patients with high PRA represent the highest EC responses. Therefore, they display not macrovascular lesions, but microvascular intrarenal disease; this defect is most likely secondary to chronic immunologic insult.\r"

Forty-seven out of seventy-three (64%) increased their mean blood pressure (MBP) by 18.6 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) in response to CPT. In NT subjects 23 out of 49 (47%) were responders (MBP = 16.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). In NT, but not in HT, patients, a negative relationship was observed between MBP changes during CPT and age (P less than .001) or basal DBP (P less than .01). There was no relationship between blood pressure response and the presence of a family history of hypertension. A positive correlation was found in HT patients between basal levels of active renin (AR) in the upright position and MBP changes during CPT (P less than .001). Mean plasma AR was 24.2 +/- 3.5 pg/mL in nonresponders v 37.5 +/- 2.9 pg/mL in responders (P less than .001). In HT, but not in NT, patients, blood pressure changes were associated with a simultaneous increase in HR (P less than .01 between delta MBP and delta HR). These results suggest that blood pressure elevation during CPT is a very common reaction in young normotensive subjects especially in those that have the lowest mean blood pressure. Therefore it is unlikely that CPT may be used as a predictor test of future hypertension in this population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There appears to be a strong association between hypertension and immunologic dysfunction in humans and in rats. Patients with severe hypertension have significantly higher levels of serum IgG in comparison with normotensive controls. A positive correlation has been found between serum IgG levels and blood pressure in untreated essential hypertensive patients. In some studies it has been demonstrated that autoantibody levels are higher in both untreated and treated hypertensive patients than in normotensive control subjects. Furthermore, in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), several indices of immune system function have been shown to be depressed. There is also a significant correlation between immune intervention and antihypertensive effects. Short term administration of anti-rat thymocyte serum results in a significant decrease in the arterial pressure of the SHR. Chronic cyclophosphamide treatment prevents the progression of hypertension and significantly reduces its final level in the adult SHR. Neonatal thymic implants from normotensive donor rats delay the development of hypertension and significantly attenuate the level of the hypertensive state in the SHR. Also, thymectomy at an age of 4 weeks delays the development of hypertension in the SHR. The differences in the antihypertensive effectiveness of a variety of immunological manipulations in the SHR may be the result of their different levels of improvement on the severity of the autoimmune process in these rats.\r"

The increasing use of recombinant DNA techniques and synthetic peptide technology has allowed many groups to identify at the epitope level the regions of HIV proteins which act as targets for (and stimulate) the immune response. Epitopes which stimulate and bind neutralizing antibodies have been examined in detail and an ever-increasing number of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes are being defined, as are potentially harmful (immunosuppressive or enhancing) domains. It still is not clear which of the different immune responses (or combinations thereof) it will be necessary to stimulate in order to protect from infection. Infected humans develop neutralizing antibodies, ADCC-inducing antibodies and CTL responses against a variety of viral proteins but it is not known which of these can control or prevent infection in vivo. The extensive knowledge of HIV and the immune response it elicits is being used to design and produce a wide variety of putative vaccines, ranging from whole inactivated virus, through recombinant organisms/proteins, to synthetic peptides although each has its inherent advantages and disadvantages. The very nature of HIV makes vaccine development difficult at best. However, recent successes using whole inactivated virus or virus-infected cells in the macaque simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) model system at least show that protection against lethal lentivirus infection can be achieved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We observed a statistical difference between male and female (1%, 2%, p less than 0.05). A difference was also observed according to the areas studied: the HTLV-I antibody rate increased from coastal (0.3%) to northern (5.4%) provinces.

Serum samples from polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HTLV-II-infected people, HTLV-I carriers, and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients were tested for antibody reactivity to RP-IIB by Western blot assay. The results showed all 27 HTLV-II carriers, 10 of 20 HTLV-I carriers, and 4 of 17 (23.5%) ATL patients had antibody reactivities to RP-IIB. The difference in rates of seropositivity to RP-IIB between HTLV-II carriers (100%) and HTLV-I-infected people (carriers plus ATL patients) (37.8%) is statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 4.30E-08).\r"

  ".W": "The shaking method of harvesting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a powerful method of obtaining high titer, highly infective virus solutions. In this method infected cells are suspended in a small volume of liquid and the mixture is shaken. Viral infectivity, measured by tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) studies, rises faster than virus titer, as measured by reverse transcriptase levels. It is postulated that this disproportionate increase in infectivity results from improved infectivity for the virus particles obtained from shaking the infected cells. Of the five strains of HIV-1 studied (IIIB, AL1212, 906, RJ4029, and MN), one strain, MN, behaved differently than the others. Upon shaking, its virus titer increased 18-fold, as opposed to the 5-10 fold increase demonstrated by the other strains. These results may indicate that MN virions are retained more on the surface of the infected cells, rather than budding off into the surrounding medium, than other HIV-1 strains. In support of this theory it was found that ratios of immunofluorescence assay scores to reverse transcriptase levels were higher for MN than for other strains.\r"

Since T-cell proliferation is regulated by monocytes (M phi), studies were undertaken to determine whether defective M phi function contributes to these poor mitogenic responses. M phi were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of normal donors by adherence to plastic. After 5 days in culture, the adherent cells were inoculated with the HIV-1 M phi-tropic strain, Ba-L. Under these conditions HIV infection in M phi can be detected 5-7 days after inoculation. Ten to fourteen days postinoculation, the adherent cells were harvested with lidocaine and cocultured with fresh autologous T cells and T-cell mitogens in a 3-day assay. We found decreased proliferative anti-CD3 responses to Leu4 and OKT3 and variable responses to concanavalin A (Con A) by T cells cultured with HIV-infected monocytes compared with T cells cultured with uninfected M phi. Supernatants from HIV-infected M phi cultures decreased proliferative responses of normal PBMC to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. Heat-activated supernatants had the same effect. Inhibitors of HIV binding did not restore proliferative responses of HIV-infected cultures to normal levels. These results indicate that HIV infection of M phi causes the release of soluble factor(s) that suppress anti-CD3-induced T-cell proliferative responses.\r"

The unprocessed p55 gag precursor polyprotein alone was assembled to form HIV-1 particles which budded from cells. The particles were spherical and immature, containing an electron-dense shell in the particle submembrane; there was no evidence of core formation. Expression of both gag and pol proteins from a recombinant containing the complete gag-pol coding sequences resulted in intracellular processing of gag-pol proteins and the production of mature particles with electron-dense cores characteristic of wild-type HIV virions. To ascertain the role of protein processing in particle maturation, the pol ORF in the gag-pol recombinant was truncated to limit expression of the pol gene to the protease domain. With this recombinant expressing p55 gag and protease, intracellular processing was observed. Some of the resultant particles were partially mature and contained processed gag protein subunits. In contrast, particle maturation was not observed when the HIV-1 protease and p55 gag were coexpressed from separate recombinants, despite evidence of intracellular gag processing. These findings suggest that HIV-1 protease must be an integral component of the full-length gag-pol precursor for optimal processing and virion maturation.\r"

Our studies revealed that, in combination with an appropriate adjuvant (lipid-based adjuvant or mineral carrier complex), immunization with recombinant gp160 led to the appearance of gp160-primed T cells. The T-cell response obtained was substantial (proliferative response of greater than 100,000 delta dpm after one primary and two booster immunizations), gp160-specific (proliferation only in response to gp160, no proliferation after addition of a mock gp160 preparation), and long-lasting (T cell responses of greater than 50,000 delta dpm were observed more than one year after the last booster). The results presented here differ from those of previous studies in that they show the presence of substantial and long-lasting T-cell memory toward the immunogen gp160. Therefore further investigations on the use of these preparations as HIV candidate vaccines appear to be justified.\r"

There was no GGT expression in basal cell carcinoma or most benign skin tumours, but keratoacanthomas were weakly positive. Keratinocytes in the vicinity of malignant melanocytes also expressed GGT. This study suggests that GGT expression, while not a simple marker of malignancy, may represent reversion to a less differentiated or 'foetal' phenotype.\r"

The blister fluid from controls contained up to 15 micrograms/l of tryptase, whereas that from patients with active urticaria contained greater than 50 micrograms/l. This study demonstrates that patients with urticaria have mast cells that readily release tryptase in both the lesional and non-lesional areas of skin.\r"

This suggests that in-vivo exposure of human epidermis to solar-simulated UV-irradiation causes changes in the enzymic antioxidant defence system which, in turn, are accompanied by increased level of oxidative stress.\r"

The vascular response was measured to a range of doses of UVB, and dilutions of contact allergens and sodium lauryl sulphate. The detection threshold of the scanning LDV was equal to, or lower than, that of the conventional instrument. For allergic contact hypersensitivity reactions (ACH), the coefficient of variation was significantly less using the scanning LDV. The scanning LDV allowed accurate measurement of the change in area that occurs with increasing intensity of inflammatory reaction. For ACH reactions the area of inflammation continued to increase at dilutions where blood flux had reached a plateau. The flare area was found to increase linearly with log dose of histamine with no change in blood flux.\r"

Lymphocytes from 72 of these patients were also cultured with streptokinase/streptodornase (SK/SD), and 20 of the patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were further tested with PPD, Candida albicans and sonicated Streptococcus mutans, a bacterial type not associated clinically with psoriasis. The median stimulation index (SI) of the psoriasis group to the Strep-A preparation was significantly higher than that of a group of 27 non-psoriatic individuals (P less than 0.05). Within this group, only the patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 42) showed a significantly increased proliferative response compared to the non-psoriatic controls (median SI = 123.8 and 31.9, respectively, P less than 0.01). Although the lymphocyte response of the chronic plaque group to SK/SD was also markedly higher than that of the control group, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In addition, these patients did not show significantly increased responses to any of the other antigens tested, including S. mutans. No correlation was observed between the degree of proliferation to Strep-A and disease extent or activity. Similarly, ASO titres, which were raised in 11 out of 23 guttate and three out of nine chronic plaque psoriasis patients tested, did not correlate with the proliferative responses observed.\r"

This study was carried out to examine whether these epidermal nuclear reactions are true or simply an excision artefact. We observed the epidermal nuclear reactions for IgG only and not for other immunoglobulins in both in-vivo and in-vitro organ-culture studies, despite the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) of all immunoglobulin classes. The association of the in-vitro epidermal nuclear reactions with serum RNP antibodies, although not absolute was statistically significant. The absorption of the serum with extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) preparation diminished the nuclear reactivity on tissue explants. In addition, the penetration of ANA into the nuclei of skin explants was both time and temperature dependent and was inhibited by sodium azide and by oligomycin. We conclude that the epidermal nuclear staining reactions observed by direct immunofluorescence on skin biopsies is selective and that the penetration of IgG into the epidermal cell nuclei is an active process and not an artefact.\r"

  ".U": "91337966\r", 
  ".W": "In this paper we present estimates of the difference in the cost of hospital care for women having different modes of singleton delivery. The estimates are based on observation of resources used in different procedures, and on data from the North West Thames Region Maternity Information System. For vaginal delivery the average cost is 363 pounds, but could fall between 189 pounds and 773 pounds, and for caesarean section the average cost is 1123 pounds, with a likely range from 837 pounds to 1560 pounds. The wide ranges in the costs of the two modes of delivery reflect variation in the length of stay and in the intensity of care required. The average cost for intrapartum care and postnatal stay is estimated to be 451 pounds for all singleton births. Variation in operative delivery rates between hospitals implies differences in the overall cost of care at different maternity units. This partly reflects differences in the needs of the population served by the units, but also differences in clinical practice. It is important for decision makers to consider the balance between the costs and outcomes of different policies of care.\r"

Ponderal index (birthweight/length3) is used by paediatricians as a measure of neonatal wasting and would therefore be expected to correlate with HC/AC ratios at delivery. Anthropometric data on 999 newborn infants have been collected and analyzed by multiple regression. The results show a poor correlation between ponderal index and HC/AC ratio, worse than that between ponderal index and AC alone. The use of HC/AC ratios antenatally to identify subgroups of intrauterine malnutrition should be abandoned. The prediction of intrauterine malnutrition by weight/length ratios should be investigated further.\r"

DESIGN--Randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind trial. SETTING--Radboud University Hospital, Nijmegen (67 women) and Lievensberg Hospital, Bergen op Zoom (10 women). PARTICIPANTS--77 women entered the trial (three were excluded). INTERVENTIONS--The intramuscular injection, immediately after the birth of the baby, of either oxytocin 5 IU, sulprostone 500 micrograms or 0.9% saline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Quantitative postpartum blood loss and length of third stage. RESULTS--Postpartum blood loss was reduced almost equally, by about 35%, by oxytocin (P = 0.02), or sulprostone (P = 0.05). The mean length of the third stage was shorter in both groups receiving the active treatment, this effect was significant in the sulprostone group (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION--Prophylactic administration of oxytocin or sulprostone directly after delivery followed by expectant management of the third stage reduces post partum blood loss and shortens the third stage.\r"

Between 1955 and 1983 the frequency of multiple births declined by about 25% (from 12.6/1000 deliveries to 9.6/1000 deliveries). The downward trend was constant until the early 1970s when rates tended to level off and increase slightly. This finding was largely attributable to trends in dizygotic rates, monozygotic births being approximately constant over the period considered. Multiple birth rates rose till age 35-39, being more than two times higher in this age group than in teenagers, but flattened off in the subsequent strata of age: this finding was constant over the period considered. Despite the general decreasing trend, the regional differences persisted largely unchanged, multiple birth rates being about 30% higher in Southern (and less developed areas) of the country than in the North of Italy. Geographic differences were limited to dizygotic pregnancies, monozygotic rates being constant (about 4/1000 pregnancies) in various areas.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the efficacy, toxicity and survival in patients with high risk GTT treated with the EMA/CO regimen (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, vincristine/oncovine). DESIGN--Open non-randomized study of 148 consecutive patients referred to the Charing Cross Hospital between 1979 and 1989. SETTING--Trophoblastic disease centre in a London teaching hospital. SUBJECTS--148 consecutive patients with high risk GTT were treated with the EMA/CO regimen. 76 patients had received no prior chemotherapy and 72 had received prior chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Survival, causes of treatment failure and toxicity were analysed. RESULTS--Of 76 patients who had received no prior chemotherapy, 62 (82%) are in remission; an overall survival of 85% for the 148 patients. Ten of the 76 patients without prior chemotherapy died from extensive disease within 3 weeks of starting chemotherapy. The complete and partial response rates to EMA/CO chemotherapy were 80% and 18% respectively. The addition of cisplatin salvaged 9 of 11 (82%) who developed drug resistance and did not require surgery. Salvage surgery alone resulted in 7 of 8 (87%) having complete remissions. Relapse after EMA/CO chemotherapy is uncommon (5.4%) but survival is still relatively good with further chemotherapy and/or surgery with 6 (75%) of 8 patients obtaining a further sustained remission. Complications from EMA/CO chemotherapy are acceptable with myelosuppression being dose-limiting. Late sequelae are uncommon: menstruation usually returns with a few months, and no fetal abnormalities have been recorded in subsequent pregnancies. One patient developed what we presume to be a therapy-induced acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSION--At present EMA/CO chemotherapy is our treatment of choice for patients with high risk GTT. Its toxicity is predictable and reversible. In patients developing drug resistance, salvage surgery is important. Future developments may include further dose intensification with the addition of haemopoietic growth factors, earlier diagnosis and the separation of gestational from non-gestational trophoblastic tumours.\r"

SUBJECTS--1250 questionnaires were sent out prior to planned admission and 1200 women (96%) brought the completed questionnaires. They comprised 598 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, 312 having laparoscopy because of infertility, 156 having laparoscopy because of chronic pelvic pain and 134 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstrual regularity, premenstrual spotting, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain in women with either endometriosis and post infective pelvic adhesions or a normal pelvis. RESULTS--Menorrhagia, menstrual irregularity and premenstrual spotting occurred with equal frequency in all groups. Deep dyspareunia, pain after intercourse and recurrent pain unrelated to menstruation or coitus was more common in women with endometriosis and those with post infective pelvic adhesions than in those with a normal pelvis. Dysmenorrhoea appears to be more prevalent among women having endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS--Menstrual symptoms, while raising a high index of suspicion for endometriosis, are not entirely reliable as indicators of disease. Dysmenorrhoea is the most common reported symptom in endometriosis sufferers. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered before institution of treatment in women complaining of pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms.\r"

In four women the first stage had to be repeated: in one the implant was placed too superficially, in another it did not provide adequate expansion, in a further instance the implant became infected and the fourth woman received a surgical wound to her labia. The second stage was successful in all 16 women who now have a vagina lined with viable epithelium. The vaginal length was satisfactory in all but one. Two women complained of a vaginal discharge due to hair at the vaginal vault, two women developed postoperative haematomas and one experienced introital stenosis. The disadvantage of the procedure is that it requires two operative stages and involves a prolonged hospital stay but it is not technically complex and results in a full length vagina that does not require dilatation.\r"

When using a friend's bathroom 38% of the women voided by crouching. Results were similar for 155 patients attending a urodynamic clinic, 80 of whom were studied while voiding in both positions. There was a 21% reduction in average urine flow rate and a 149% increase in residual urine volume in the crouching position. Women undergoing urodynamic tests should be asked which voiding position they used before abnormal results are interpreted. Patients with a reduced functional bladder capacity may benefit from being encouraged to sit comfortably on the toilet whenever possible.\r"

Final visual acuity of the patients fell into two groups, one worse than 20/600 (15 eyes) and the other better than 20/30 (11 eyes). The patients with poor visual outcome showed diffuse retinal arteritis or arterial obliteration which was associated with reduced amplitude of electroretinographic a and b waves and elevated levels of circulating immune complex, even at an early stage when retinal exudates were still localised to the peripheral fundus. The retinal exudates in these patients extended rapidly to the posterior pole. In contrast, the patients with good visual outcome showed retinal arteritis limited within retinal exudates throughout the course. These signs at an early stage can be used as prognostic factors to manage patients with acute retinal necrosis more constructively.\r"

Three eyes that had received laser treatment posterior to areas of retinitis suffered retinal detachment despite this prophylactic treatment. Poor visual outcome resulted from viral infection of the optic nerve or macular involvement, macular hole formation, macular pucker, or hypotony.\r"

Recordings were made in both the standing and supine positions. The amplitude of the intraocular pressure pulse was significantly lower in patients with LTG (1.2, SEM 0.1 mmHg standing, and 1.3, SEM 0.1 mmHg lying) than in healthy subjects (1.9, SEM 0.1 mmHg standing, and 2.0 SEM 0.1 mmHg lying): p less than 0.001 standing and p less than 0.002 lying. Measurement of POBF also showed a significant reduction between the healthy subjects (428 (31) SEM microliters/min standing and 345 (28) SEM microliters/min lying) and subjects with LTG (301 (27) SEM microliters/min standing and 249 (24) SEM microliters/min lying), p less than 0.005 standing and p less than 0.02 lying. This represents a difference of approximately 30% between the two groups in either posture. A close non-parametric correlation existed between the level of IOP and the POBF (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001 standing, and r = -0.55, p less than 0.02 lying). Such a correlation was not present in the healthy subjects. A reduction in POBF occurred in both groups on assuming the supine posture (healthy subjects 83 (16) SEM microliters/min, LTG subjects 52 (17) SEM microliters/min). These figures represent reductions of 19% and 17% respectively in comparison with the standing value. The results lend further confirmation to the hypothesis that vascular factors are associated with low tension glaucoma.\r"

One eye of each patient was randomly assigned to receive BSS Plus, and the other eye to receive S-MA2. BSS Plus caused significantly less corneal swelling on the first postoperative day than did S-MA2. There was no difference between the two solutions in their effect on corneal thickness one week and one month postoperatively. Computer assisted morphometric analysis of wide-field specular microscopic photographs demonstrated minimal changes in endothelial morphological characteristics in the eyes irrigated with BSS Plus. By comparison S-MA2, caused a significant loss of endothelial cells and a marked reduction in the figure coefficient. These results indicated that BSS Plus has a clinical advantage over S-MA2 with respect to the corneal endothelium.\r"

After facial nerve avulsion 50% of patients remained free of troublesome spasm for 15 months after surgery, but only 25% remained so for more than two years. Following orbicularis oculi myectomy 50% of patients were free of troublesome spasms for 30 months after surgery and 55% of patients had relief from spasm for more than two years. Secondary effects of the two procedures are compared and are found to be fewer after orbicularis myectomy. There were no major complications after either form of surgery. Botulinum toxin is the treatment of first choice for this condition. If this becomes ineffective or inconvenient, surgical treatment is warranted and should not be deferred for fear of severe side effects of treatment, since these are rare. Protractor myectomy gives longer relief from blepharospasm than facial nerve avulsion and has fewer complications. However, it is technically difficult, time consuming, and has greater peroperative morbidity. Facial nerve avulsion may therefore still have a role in selected patients.\r"

In the third eye, which had a sector iridectomy, laser hyaloidotomy applied over the edge of the lens optic through the iridectomy resulted in brisk deepening of the anterior chamber and reduction of intraocular pressure. We propose that the one-piece 7 mm optic posterior chamber intraocular lens may constitute an obstacle to successful hyaloidotomy, mainly owing to its large size, as it may block aqueous percolation from the vitreous into the anterior chamber. Eyes prone to develop malignant glaucoma after surgery should have a sector or large peripheral iridectomy to facilitate postoperative Nd-YAG laser hyaloidotomy if required.\r"

  ".W": "Images of lymphoproliferative disorders of the thyroid by ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), 99Tcm and 67Ga scintigraphy were analysed in eight patients (two men and six women, aged 42-83 years). Seven patients were diagnosed as having primary lymphoma and one plasmacytoma. Ultrasound revealed a solid mass with homogeneous and very low echogenicity clearly distinguishable from residual thyroid tissue in five patients, diffuse hypoechoic goitre in one and multiple irregular hypoechoic nodules in both lobes in the patient with plasmacytoma (Case 8). Computed tomography demonstrated a focal low-density area in six cases of lymphoma and decreased density throughout the gland in the other two patients. 99Tcm scintigraphy showed hemilobar enlargement with decreased and uneven trapping, cold area or complete lobar defect in six patients with lymphoma and no trapping in the case of plasmacytoma. 67Ga scintigraphy demonstrated high accumulation in lymphoma and faint accumulation in the case of plasmacytoma. Radiological manifestations with a focal lesion were considered typical and diagnostic of primary thyroid lymphoma, while in one case with diffuse infiltration through the whole gland, the differential diagnosis from Hashimoto's thyroiditis could not be made. In the final case, cells infiltrated diffusely to form islands with patchy distribution among well preserved follicles, correlating with the multiple hypoechoic areas observed by US.\r"

Eighteen patients had pleural empyema and six had transudative effusions. Of the 18 empyema patients, 13 had abnormally high attenuation in the extrapleural tissues. In 12 of these 13, the high attenuation was probably caused by reaction to the pleural infection. In two, it was probably caused by haematoma (one patient had haematoma and empyema). In five patients there was either no clear abnormality in the extrapleural space or an insufficient amount of fat to permit detection of an abnormality, or the parietal pleura could not be distinguished from the pleural fluid because intravenous contrast medium was not given. Of the six patients with proven transudative pleural effusions, all had extrapleural fat which appeared normal. Abnormally high attenuation in the extrapleural tissues can be expected to accompany exudative pleural effusion, particularly empyema, but not transudative effusion.\r"

One unwanted effect is temporary impairment of visual accommodation. Near and distance vision were assessed in 100 patients undergoing barium meal and barium enema studies. Visual testing was performed prior to the examination and repeated immediately before leaving the radiology department. Completed data was obtained in 90 patients. Of these, 37 were given a conventional 20 mg intravenous dose of HBB, 37 were given glucagon and 16 received no drug. No patient showed any impairment of distance vision. Minor abnormalities of near vision were observed in five patients. All had been given HBB. They were aged 50 years or less and had been retested 12-21 min after administration of the drug. It is suggested that the degree of visual impairment observed is not sufficient to impair driving ability. Routine questioning concerning history of glaucoma is unlikely to be of value; more appropriate would be a warning to seek urgent medical advice if eye pain or visual loss is experienced.\r"

There was a significant difference (p = 0.04) between the two groups with respect to delayed pain, when iotrolan was associated with a lower incidence and decreased severity of delayed pain. There were no differences in the incidence of nausea, vomiting, headache and syncope. No allergic phenomena were seen in either group.\r"

Five radiologists of varying experience independently viewed elbow radiographs on a conventional light-box, and subsequently using the digitizer, indicating the presence or absence of a fracture. The overall results demonstrated no difference in performance when using the unit, though small improvements in the confidence with which a definite diagnosis was made were observed. Assessment of soft tissues with the digitizer was less reliable.\r"

A direct electronic imaging device is currently marketed by Varian (the DYNARAY ID), which uses the latest technology in detection and image processing to obtain digital images of the patient's anatomy using the actual treatment beam. At Norwich we have been using a prototype machine in a busy district radiotherapy centre and have examined over 50 patients. We have found the images easy to obtain and the technique superior to the standard practice of using verification radiographs. The role of this device lies in aiding quality assurance of treatments whilst generating a permanent record of the actual treatment given.\r"

  ".U": "91338939\r", 
  ".W": "The age-dependent radiation dose to the haematopoietic tissue of bone marrow has been calculated for exposure to radon, thoron and their daughter products. The component of dose due to pure radon is dependent on the fat content of the marrow, since the solubility of radon in fat is about 16 times that in tissue. The mean dose equivalent muSv to the total active marrow is estimated for a range of fat cell diameters from 25 to 200 microns, taking account of the percentage cellularity and distribution of active marrow as a function of age. Similarly, the dose due to the inhalation of short-lived radon daughters was estimated, based on measurements in blood and marrow, modified to allow for the greater deposition of daughter products expected in children. An estimate of the age-dependent dose from long-lived radon daughters was made from uranium miner and natural exposure data. Dose estimates were made for the average UK indoor exposure to radon gas of 20 Bq/m3 and an equilibrium equivalent thoron concentration of 0.3 Bq/m3. The annual radon and thoron derived dose to the active marrow of the newborn was calculated as 30 and 40 muSv, respectively. For a 10-year-old child, the radon and thoron derived annual dose are 70 and 40 muSv, and for a 40-year-old adult 90 and 30 muSv, respectively. The above values exhibit wide range limits due principally to uncertainties in the accumulation of 210Pb in bone, and 210Po in marrow. These data indicate that at the average UK exposure, the alpha-particle dose to active marrow is dominated by that derived from inhaled radon and thoron compared with dietary intake. In infants the dose is dominated by thoron daughters. At the UK radon Action Limit of 200 Bq/m3, the radon and associated thoron derived dose is similar to that from all low LET sources. This work shows that the dose to red bone marrow from radon and thoron is significant, and that the possibility of leukaemia induced by these radiation sources warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "One thousand patients with renal stones up to 3 cm in diameter were divided equally into 2 groups matched for age, sex and stone size. One group was treated on the Dornier HM3 lithotriptor and the other on the EDAP LT01. The results showed that for stones less than 1 cm both lithotriptors were equally effective, with a stone-free rate of 87.5% for the Dornier and 90.4% for the EDAP at 3 months. The success rate fell more steeply for the EDAP machine, however, to become 77.2 and 42.5% respectively as the stone size increased to 3 cm. Treatment time was longer on the EDAP lithotriptor and more sessions were required but patients preferred it to the Dornier. Running costs per patient were higher on the EDAP.\r"
