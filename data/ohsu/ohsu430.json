To better understand the mechanism for the association between genital ulcers and HIV, exudates from 62 genital ulcers of 56 HIV-seropositive prostitutes in Nairobi (Kenya) were cultured for HIV. Twenty-six ulcer cultures could not be evaluated for the presence of HIV because of bacterial or fungal contamination. HIV was isolated from 4 (11%) of the 36 remaining uncontaminated ulcer cultures (2 introital, 1 vaginal, and 1 cervical) from 4 separate women. HIV was isolated from the cervical os from only 2 of the 4 women. HIV p24 antigen was detected in exudate from 1 of the 4 culture-positive ulcers and 0 of 32 culture-negative ulcers. Genital ulcers in seropositive patients should be regarded as potential sources of HIV, which could be important in transmission of HIV during intercourse. Public health measures aimed at controlling sexually transmitted genital ulcer diseases should be an integral part of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention programs.\r"

Serum samples and vaginal secretions were tested for antibodies to HIV-1 IgG and IgA by Western blot analysis. Antibodies of the IgG and IgA classes were detected in serum samples and vaginal secretions from healthy seropositive women and from women with AIDS. Local IgG antibodies to all viral proteins were detected by Western blot tests. Genital IgA antibodies were mainly directed to the core proteins p18 and p25, the p68 reverse transcriptase, and the gp160 and gp41 glycoproteins; IgA antibodies to the glycoprotein gp120 were rarely recovered. Antibodies of both the IgG and IgA classes in genital secretions were directed to all viral proteins, including surface glycoproteins, and could play a role in limiting the virus infectivity on normal mucosa.\r"

Human convalescent group C sera had a high titer (1:320) when tested against the human isolates and a low titer (1:40) when tested against a porcine reference strain (Cowden). When porcine antiserum (Cowden) was tested against the human isolates, the titers ranged from 1:40 to 1:320, indicating significant antigenic diversity between strains. Group C rotavirus appears to have a worldwide distribution as an agent associated with diarrhea in children and adults.\r"

Patients were evaluated every second day for endotoxemia and coagulation activation. Of 153 gastric aspirates, 66.7% contained microorganisms at a mean quantity of 10(7) cfu/ml. Nosocomial pneumonia occurred in 15 patients, septicemia in 5, and meningitis in 1. The stomach was the evident source of infection in only 1 patient with pneumonia. Of 140 plasma samples, 12 (8.6%) from 10 patients showed detectable endotoxin levels, but there was no association between endotoxemia or coagulation activation and the presence of microorganisms in the stomach. The stomach was not an important source for nosocomial infections or endotoxemia, even in patients with high gastric pH.\r"

In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for surface antigens, 17 (71%) of 24 persons with Campylobacter enteritis showed seroconversion in more than one immunoglobulin class, versus only 2 (5%) of 40 patients with non-Campylobacter enteritis. In a GM1, ganglioside-based ELISA for detecting serum IgG to cholera-like enterotoxin, only one patient studied showed seroconversion to the enterotoxin. Of 22 Campylobacter isolates studied for production of cholera-like toxin, none of the supernatants from the Campylobacter strains were positive. Supernatants were also tested for enterotoxin and cytotoxic activity on Chinese hamster ovary cells; all isolates were negative for enterotoxin activity. In contrast, cytotoxin was produced by 7 (32%) isolates but was usually low-level and was not neutralized by patient's serum. These findings indicate that production of cholera-like toxin and cytotoxin by Campylobacter strains in the United States occurs in few strains and that host immune response is absent; their biologic significance in the pathogenesis of Campylobacter infections remains unclear.\r"

Pharmacokinetics of MA-1C1 were compared in infected and noninfected animals. Intravenous bolus infusion of MA-1C1, 1 mg/kg, resulted in peak serum antibody concentrations of 3.8 +/- 0.08 and 3.7 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml in infected and noninfected animals, respectively. Serum half-lives were 25 and 22 h in infected and noninfected groups. Treatment with a single intravenous infusion of MA-1C1 improved survival from pneumonia and was effective over a broad dose range (0.1-2.5 mg/kg). Cumulative survivals were 18 of 47 in the MA-1C1 group and 0 of 31 in controls (P less than .001). Treatment with MA-1C1 also resulted in fewer positive blood cultures 12 h after infection (P = .04). Although MA-1C1 penetrated into inflamed bronchial fluids, local concentrations were only 5% of the concentrations achieved in serum. Thus, MA-1C1 seems to provide significant therapeutic activity against experimental P. aeruginosa pneumonia by preventing dissemination of infection from the lung.\r"

B. burgdorferi adhered to both types of cells in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited an affinity for an extracellular matrix produced by the primary and by glioma cell cultures. Adherence of the spirochetes to the glial components of the primary brain culture could be an early event in the production of neurological injury; its affinity for cells could be the reason for its infrequent isolation from cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

Most developed the disease after eating raw walrus, and the clinical presentation of most of these cases differed from previously reported descriptions of classic trichinosis due to Trichinella spiralis. Unlike the classic syndrome of a brief period of diarrhea followed by fever, myalgia, muscle weakness, and edema, the most common presentation in these cases was a prolonged diarrhea without fever and with brief muscle symptoms. High peripheral eosinophilia, high Trichinella antibody serotiters, and little direct or indirect evidence of muscle invasion in many of those with the chronic diarrheal presentation suggest a new clinical syndrome due to a different species of Trichinella seen in the Arctic or to reinfection with Trichinella.\r"

This protein does not appear to be extensively posttranslationally modified. Serum samples from 52 individuals exposed to O. volvulus were examined for antibodies recognizing the lambda RAL-2 recombinant antigen; 77% produced such antibodies. In addition, individuals producing antibodies recognizing the recombinant antigen were significantly less likely to develop some aspects of ocular pathology associated with O. volvulus infection than were individuals who did not do so. These results suggest that recombinant antigens such as that produced by lambda RAL-2 may be useful in attempts to understand the mechanism of O. volvulus-induced ocular pathology.\r"

Fibronectin was localized ultrastructurally on S. aureus in suspension and in interactions with cultured bovine endothelial cells. Probes were constructed by adsorbing fibronectin or its antibodies to colloidal gold beads (FN-Au or aFN-Au, respectively). Sites of fibronectin binding to S. aureus were demonstrated by reacting FN-Au with S. aureus in suspension. Transmission electron microscopy showed that FN-Au localized uniformly over the surface of S. aureus in suspension; most localized within 65 nm of the cell wall. The distribution of aFN-Au on S. aureus adherent to endothelial cells was concentrated in areas between S. aureus and endothelial cells. Areas of S. aureus not facing endothelial cells bound few aFN-Au. This suggests that the fibronectin labeled by aFN-Au in areas between S. aureus and endothelial cells was involved in adherence of the S. aureus, consistent with a role for fibronectin in endocarditis.\r"

Early surgical treatment by local resection just before or just after radiotherapy and radical mastoidectomy produced disease free survival for two to 20 years in 59 per cent (16 of 27) patients. Long term survival was achieved in 50 per cent of patients with carcinoma of the external auditory meatus and only 24 per cent of those with middle ear carcinoma. Salvage surgery produced a variable degree and duration of palliation but few survivors. Little was gained in the quality of life by petrosectomy.\r"

The sublabial approach is most useful in children and women, particularly those with intermediate grade tumours. The advantages of the approach compared to the lateral rhinotomy incision include: superior access to the floor of the nose, inferior turbinate and anterior nasal septum; access to both sides of the nasal septum and the absence of a facial scar. The limitations of the sublabial technique are the poor access to frontal sinus and the cribriform plate.\r"

One third of patients experienced a transient exacerbation of diplopia but this resolved in most patients. Persistent diplopia occurred in seven patients and required medical correction in four and surgery in one. This was due in all cases to underaction of the superior oblique muscle and probably to backward displacement of the trochlea which may be avoided by careful surgical re-attachment.\r"

Initially, a free temporalis fascia graft, harvested from the contralateral scalp, is placed around the oral commissure of the paralyzed side of the face through an incision in the nasolabial crease. Several weeks later, an ipsilateral temporalis muscle and fascia transfer is made to the anterior face and attached to the previously placed fascia graft. Oral commissure grafting, as a first step, provides for a secure anchoring point for the temporalis flap, and achieves a more satisfactory correction of the oral commissure.\r"

The group was predominantly female (15/18) and atopy was rare; indeed, only one patient, who had a history of allergic rhinitis, was found to be atopic. Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids cured or helped the cough in 16/18 patients.

He was followed up until he left the area aged 11 years. He represented aged 12 years with a progressive swelling of the left submandibular gland. Histology of the surgically excised submandibular gland revealed a mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the submandibular gland.

One patient was taking imipramine, and therapeutic concentrations of imipramine and desipramine were documented in postmortem blood. The other patient was receiving desipramine documented by in-patient hospital medication records. Both cases had liver lesions associated in the medical literature with adverse drug reaction to imipramine.

  ".U": "89341672\r", 
  ".W": "Mild hyperthermia to the extent of a 2.5 degrees C increase above normal body temperature was produced by immersion of ethanol-intoxicated subjects in a warm water bath. Hyperthermia did not influence the blood-alcohol decay curve of the subjects. Hyperthermia did cause a significant distortion of the breath-alcohol decay curve, up to as much as a 23% increase above blood-alcohol concentration. The magnitude of this distortion effect was calculated to be a 8.62% increase in breath-alcohol concentration over blood-alcohol concentration for each degree C increase in core body temperature. The forensic relevance of these results is that further support is given to previous recommendations that temperature monitoring be included in procedures for breath-alcohol analysis. This leads to the recommendation that mouth temperature be measured before breath sampling to screen for abnormal body temperature and to allow for potential use of a \"temperature correction factor.\" This modification to existing analytical procedures would optimize the reliability of breath-ethanol analysis for prediction of blood-ethanol concentration.\r"

The limited specificity for analyzing ethanol in expired breath has given misleading information with potential serious consequences. Three different methods of alcohol analysis are reported: semiconductor sensing (Alcotest 7310), electrochemical fuel cell (Alcolmeter SM-1), and infrared (IR) absorptiometry (IR Intoximeter 3000). Methanol could not be distinguished from ethanol with any of these breath-test instruments. When nonspecific techniques of ethanol analysis are used, the results must be considered with caution when interfering substances expelled in breath cannot be excluded.\r"

The four populations of interest included U.S. Navy and Marine Corps recruits and service school members. Conformed positive urines for marijuana showed a small but significant decline (p less than 0.001) from about 1.2% confirmed positive among U.S. Navy recruits entering service school commands in 1984 to 0.9% among Navy service school members in 1988 and from 2.0% among U.S. Marine Corps recruits entering service schools in 1984 to 0.8% among Marine Corps service school members in 1988. Navy and Marine Corps recruits showed a significantly higher (p less than 0.001) confirmed positive use rate (6.1 and 3.3%, respectively) compared to service school members, perhaps reflecting their recent civilian use pattern. The relatively high confirmed positive cocaine rate among all groups may have reflected an increasing trend in all populations, confirming a similar trend in high school and other civilian populations. Generally, the frequency of confirmed positive urines with amphetamines and opiates, based upon the findings at the Navy Drug Screening Laboratory at Great Lakes, has been static except for an apparent recent increase in amphetamine use in 1988. The decline in confirmed positive drug urinalyses among service school members from both the Navy and Marine Corps indicated that perhaps education and maturity had a positive effect upon their behavior.\r"

At various intervals, the tubes were sampled and analyzed using Abuscreen RIA. Also, semi-quantitative data derived from RIA analysis of forensic blood specimens were compared with quantitative data acquired using gas chromatography (GC) or GC/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) on the same specimens. RIA and chromatographic studies revealed that BZE and THC-COOH were stable in blood under all conditions studied. Cocaine, however, was found not to be stable in blood, especially when stored at room temperatures. Despite cocaine's instability in blood, RIA was able to detect the presence of cocaine and its breakdown products in blood under all conditions studied.\r"

  ".W": "With increasing frequency, forensic psychiatrists are called upon to evaluate sex offenders for the courts and criminal justice system. While many clinicians have observed that denial of paraphilia is common in sex offenders, few studies have examined whether this population has severe psychopathology other than paraphilia. Similarly, little is known about whether sex offenders minimize or deny symptoms of psychopathology when undergoing psychiatric evaluations. To study these questions, the authors administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) to 36 sex offenders, comparing the degree to which they minimized or denied psychopathology, dividing subjects among two dimensions: (a) whether they admitted to, or denied, paraphilia, and (b) whether or not they faced legal charges for sex offense. Results indicated that, first, patients who denied paraphilia were significantly more likely to minimize psychopathology than were those who admitted to paraphilia (P less than 0.05); second, patients who faced no legal charges showed significantly more psychopathology than did those who faced charges (P less than 0.05); and third, the most frequent forms of psychopathology were antisocial attitudes, depressive features, somatization, and thought disorder. These findings suggest that many sex offenders may experience, and deny, widespread and severe psychiatric symptoms in addition to their sexual disorders.\r"

The rates of change and succession are based on decomposition studies, most of which control access of scavengers to the corpse; however, many naturally exposed corpses are subject to scavenger modification. These modifications change the rate of decomposition, the pattern of insect succession, and the context of associations, thus altering estimations of time since death. A controlled feeding study with captive wolves and road-killed deer is pertinent to understanding canid scavenging and how scavenging may alter postmortem changes. During feeding, the wolves commonly dismember and devour the deer in a predictable sequence. Although there are some variations in the usual sequence, the carcass is always moved, and skeletal elements are separated, diminished in size and scattered. Scavenging must, therefore, be considered in estimating time since death.\r"

  ".W": "On a series of lateral radiographs of 154 males and 199 females from Vienna, Austria, 3 qualitative morphological features of the external nose were recorded. Their relationship to craniometric dimensions, age, and the contour of the nasal bones was tested using Wilks' stepwise discriminant analyses. All tests gave significant results at the 1% probability level, but, overall, correct assignment of the features to their categories did not exceed 61%. Although height dimensions were used for discrimination in females, the prominence of the nasal bones and age appeared to be the most important discriminating variables in both sexes. Analyses further revealed that the nasal bridge and the direction of the nasal septum are highly correlated, whereas the tip of the nose seemed to be independent; this may reflect the dependence of the latter on exogenous influences, especially nutrition. It was demonstrated that the profile line of the external nose does not follow its underlying bony structures, that is, the profile line of the nasal bones. Thus, the present study showed that obtaining soft tissue thicknesses alone is not sufficient for successful facial reconstruction, but that a more holistic approach should be used to elucidate the relationships between soft tissue cover and the underlying hyaline and bony structures.\r"

Bloodstains maintained in a desiccator at 25 or at 37 degrees C retained the native form of C3 which could be detected for at least two weeks. Beyond two weeks of storage, stains became difficult to phenotype due to decreased banding intensity. Bloodstains aged longer than one month could not be phenotyped.

The results were compared with results by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) assay for benzoylecgonine. Concordance was high between the GDC ELISA assay and GC/MS and with results reported earlier for other commercial assays. Detection times and specificity of the GDC ELISA antibody were most similar to those of the Abuscreen radioimmunoassay for cocaine metabolite. Overall, the assay produced no false negative or false positive results and appeared to be a reliable screening test for detection of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in human urine.\r"

The presence of highly fragmented and scattered remains following most plane crashes suggested that changes to procedure might improve CAPMI performance for use in these types of disasters. A total of 162 ante- and postmortem dental records which had been used successfully to identify victims of the Gander disaster were coded for anonymity and used for this investigation. Changes in data construction and management were made to CAPMI, according to concepts which were thought might improve system performance, and tested. Although most tested techniques improved CAPMI performance, the data suggested that replacement of \"virgin\" chartings with \"data unknown\" results in improved performance of CAPMI largely independent of other factors. Of 162 possible record matches, the original algorithm successfully listed the true record match in the top 20 possibilities 74% of the time; the tested variations on the original algorithm yielded results across a range of 38 to 83% successes, with most techniques performing better than the original algorithm. Results of this investigation have been incorporated into improved CAPMI procedures and software.\r"

This paper examines the significance for depressive symptoms of gender differences in exposure and vulnerability to eventful stress among a sample of physically disabled subjects. This sample provides an opportunity to more fully assess the relevance of employment for understanding gender differences in depression. Our results indicate that men and women are equally exposed and equally vulnerable to life events occurring to themselves. However, we found women to be both more exposed and more vulnerable to events occurring to others. When labor force participation is taken into account, dramatic gender differences are revealed in the apparent significance of employment for exposure and vulnerability to various kinds of stressful events. The implications of these findings for public health interventions are discussed.\r"

However, the comorbidity of agoraphobia and panic disorder seemed to be accounted for by the relationship of both disorders with depression. The mean age at appearance of first symptoms was earlier for agoraphobia (low teens) than for depression or panic disorder (both about age 20). The results do not support the view that panic disorder is an integral component of agoraphobia, but rather that it is more closely associated with depression. The fact that agoraphobia precedes depression casts doubt on the thesis that depression is primary to anxiety disorders. Interpretation should, however, be viewed with caution because of the retrospective nature of the diagnostic instrument.\r"

Levels of alliance were found to be not significantly different across the three treatment conditions. For the sample as a whole, only the patient factor of Patient Commitment was found to be associated with depressive symptoms after treatment, with the strongest findings in the cognitive therapy condition. The Patient Commitment factor uniquely contributed to outcome over and above the contribution of initial symptomatology and symptomatic change at midpoint in therapy. Expected trends of association with outcome were observed for the therapist alliance composite score in brief dynamic therapy and for the patient factor of Patient Working Capacity in both cognitive and brief dynamic therapy. Findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical and clinical implications.\r"

The entire sample was 98% male, with ages ranging from 22 to 88 years. The incidence of alcoholism was 72%, and the incidence of major mental illnesses was 17%. The stable dominant first factor (cognitive) accounted for 67 to 81% of the common variance, with a correlation of .94 between the factor loadings in the initial and replication analyses. The unstable second factor (vegetative) accounted for 15% to 19% of the common variance, with a correlation of .58 in item loadings. Consequently, the BDI appears to measure the cognitive aspects of depressive severity in a global fashion, as Beck originally intended. Approximately half of the items contribute very little useful predictive information. The fact that BDI total scores are not strongly related to the traditional vegetative symptoms of depression used in psychiatry is an artifact of the original method used to construct the test and is not a statement about the fundamental characteristics of depression.\r"

An analysis of variability of eight optical measures in four prominent areas of vision was performed by comparing two covariance matrices for equality. The test on the equality of the two covariance matrices showed that the two groups were significantly different (p less than .05). That is, MPD subjects had significantly more variability in visual functioning across alter personalities than did control subjects. Because the test of equality of the two covariance matrices rejected the null hypothesis, univariate analyses of variance were performed on the eight individual ophthalmological measures that comprised the matrix. The results of these analyses showed that MPD subjects had significantly more variability across alter personalities than did their control counterparts on measures of visual acuity with correction, visual acuity without correction, visual fields, manifest refraction, and eye muscle balance. The data were also analyzed for clinical significance. Blind ratings of the data were performed by comparing the results of the individual dependent measures across the alter personalities of individual MPD and control subjects according to established ophthalmological criteria. The ratings for clinical significance showed that the MPD subjects had 4.5 times the average number of changes in optical functioning between alter personalities of the control subjects, with a mean of 2.56 clinically significant changes for the MPD subjects and .55 clinically significant changes for the control subjects. This difference was also statistically significant (p less than .01).\r"

Histochemical and biochemical studies showed a lack of G6PD activity in muscle biopsy specimens as well as in erythrocytes. G6PD characterization in erythrocytes classified these mutant enzymes as Mediterranean variant in all the patients. The deficiency was confirmed in the patients' myotubes and skin fibroblasts, where residual activity was present. Electrophoretic studies in tissue culture extracts showed that the residual muscle enzyme migrated as a single electrophoretic band like normal human muscle G6PD.\r"

Nimodipine infusion significantly decreased the mean arterial blood pressure (P less than 0.01), while PaCO2 and clinical symptoms remained unchanged. A significant CBF improvement (P less than 0.05) after nimodipine was seen in the border zone of the ischaemic infarct but not in the core of the lesion or in the unaffected contralateral hemisphere.\r"

The clinical findings and the course of the disease were very similar in each group. In spite of a longer disease duration in the patients with early onset of the disease there was no difference in motor impairment; the younger patients did better in mental testing and they were taking less dopaminergic medication. These differences are thought to be due to the age difference rather than to the existence of different disease entities. In the early onset group more familial cases (mostly affecting siblings) were found than in the older ones. The points in favour of there being a hereditary subgroup of early onset Parkinson's disease or of environmental factors causing the disease are reviewed.\r"

However, 8%-25% of the sensory distal latencies in symptomatic hands may still be normal. A systematic study was made of the median, ulnar and radial orthodromic nerve conduction velocities (SNCV) stimulating each of the fingers separately. Four SNCVs from the median nerve, two SNCVs from the ulnar nerve and one from the radial nerve were obtained, and the ratio of the median to radial SNCV and the ratios of the median and ulnar SNCVs were estimated. The significance of these parameters in the diagnosis of the CTS was studied, and a rapid technique for the screening of nerve entrapment in the initial stages of the disease is proposed. Three hundred and seventy-five symptomatic hands were examined. Seventy-five hands showed normal distal latency, in which cases, however, the SNCV of the ring finger was always outside the normal range, while the SNCVs of the thumb, index and middle fingers were abnormal in 64%, 80% and 92% of cases respectively. The amplitudes of the sensory responses were the least sensitive of the parameters studied. Our results suggest that a study of the median nerve digital branch to the ring finger may be of value in providing an easily performed and rapid technique for screening an early median nerve entrapment at the wrist.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of levodopa (L-dopa), alone or in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (PDI), on plasma levels of aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase (ALAAD, = dopa decarboxylase), L-dopa, 3-O-methyl-dopa (3-OMD), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine beta-hydroxylase has been studied. In healthy subjects and in patients with parkinsonism plasma ALAAD level fell after administration of L-dopa + benserazide, but returned to previous levels within 90 min. In a cross-sectional study blood was obtained, 2 h after dosing, from 104 patients with idiopathic parkinsonism, divided into four groups: no L-dopa treatment (group 1), L-dopa alone (group 2), L-dopa + benserazide (Madopar) (group 3) and L-dopa + carbidopa (Sinemet) (group 4). Plasma ALAAD, which was normal in groups 1 and 2, was increased 3-fold in groups 3 and 4, indicating that there was induction of ALAAD by the co-administration of PDI. Despite this induction of ALAAD, in groups 3 and 4, with half the daily L-dopa dose compared with group 2, plasma L-dopa and 3-OMD levels were 5 times higher, while plasma DA levels were not different. The DA/L-dopa ratio was decreased 5-fold in group 2 and 16-fold in groups 3 and 4 as compared with group 1. Neither 3-OMD levels nor 3-OMD/L-dopa ratios correlated with the occurrence of on-off fluctuations. In a longitudinal study of three patients started on Madopar treatment the induction of plasma ALAAD was found to occur gradually over 3-4 weeks. Further detailed pharmacokinetic studies in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid are required in order to elucidate whether the ALAAD induction by PDI may be related to the loss of clinical efficacy of combination therapy in some patients and how it is related to end-of-dose deterioration and on-off phenomena.\r"

  ".W": "A simple method for measuring the tendon reflexes was developed. A manually operated, electronic reflex hammer was applied that enabled measurement of the strength of tendon taps. Reflex responses were recorded by surface electromyography. Stimulus-response relations and latencies of tendon reflexes in the biceps, triceps, quadriceps and triceps surae were examined in 40 healthy subjects. A characteristic relation between stimulus strength and response amplitude was found which could be described by an empirical function. Latencies of both arm and leg reflexes were linearly related to the height of the subjects. Variations of reflex amplitudes within and between subjects were comparable with previous results obtained with more complicated techniques. Although repeatability of measurement of the amplitude is limited by the variability of reflexes, significant agreement was found between repeated measurements. Most reflex amplitudes were diminished during repeated examination after a short interval. Both measurement and clinical examination showed the frequent occurrence of left-right asymmetry of reflex amplitudes. These left-right differences were reproducible to a significant degree on repeated measurements after more than 2 years.\r"

Total IgG1 levels were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from all patient groups (but not in the controls), IgG2 in bacterial infections, IgG3 in HSVE and borreliosis and IgG4 in some SSPE patients. The anti-viral (anti-measles, varicella zoster virus and rubella) IgG antibodies in MS were restricted to IgG1, anti-measles IgG to IgG1 and sometimes IgG4 in SSPE, anti-borrelia IgG to IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3. In contrast to anti-viral antibodies, anti-MBP and GM1 antibodies belonged to IgG1, IgG3 or IgG4 in MS. The nature of the immunological activation appears to be reflected in the subclass patterns elicited in the central nervous system. Different IgG subclass patterns in infectious diseases and MS suggest a difference between antigen-specific and non-specific B-cell activation.\r"

After giving equine botulinum antitoxin and simultaneous forced emptying of the bowels, ocular symptoms completely disappeared within 2 days. Six days, 5 weeks and 6 months after the first SFEMG study, the jitter was still abnormal, even becoming more so with time. Blocking, however, was only rarely observed in the follow-up studies. It is concluded that SFEMG may serve as a useful and sensitive method for the rapid diagnosis of botulinum intoxication, even in cases where no clinical signs of general muscular weakness are apparent.\r"

By selective spinal angiography it was possible to differentiate between dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVF 20 patients) and intradural AVMs (iAVM, 6 patients). Initial complaints were nonspecific and variable, mainly consisting of sensory disorders and muscle weakness. Later, patients suffered involvement of both the upper and lower motor neurons. There was a high percentage of lower motor neuron lesions (95%), especially in dAVF patients, which were mostly of widespread distribution and included several myotomes. Electrophysiological examination regularly revealed lower neuron involvement, frequently with pathological spontaneous activity in several myotomes, pathological sensory-evoked potentials after tibial nerve stimulation, but normal sensory conduction velocities of the sural nerve, indicating sparing of the sensory ganglion. Frequently there was a discrepancy between the localization of the dural fistula or angioma and the spinal level responsible for clinical symptoms. This suggests that it may be the inadequacy of the venous drainage system to cope with the blood volume rather than the AV-shunt that is responsible for the symptoms. An early diagnosis is essential, as removal of the shunt before there has been progression to severe neurological deficits (paraplegia) is the only way to ensure a satisfactory outcome.\r"

Non-diabetic inpatients (without cardiovascular or related nervous disease) served as controls. The data of the diabetics and non-diabetic age- and sex-matched inpatients were significantly different for the PHHR measured by the 30:15 ratio, sural nerve conduction velocity and sural nerve refractory period, and CRP. The results correlated with the corresponding anamnestic signs. The PHRR showed abnormal values much more frequently than the sural nerve neurography or the CRP. No correlation was found between the signs of AN and those of SN or CRP. This stresses the need for a circulatory regulation test (preferably PHRR) in any diabetic when planning narcosis, as only these AN tests can reliably predict an increased cardiovascular risk in individual patients.\r"

The measurements were made by electrophoretic separation and elution of the isoenzymes and by immunoinhibition assay. The results showed that the total and specific CK activity were significantly decreased (P less than 0.005) in neurogenic atrophies in contrast to myopathic conditions where no differences from control levels were observed. This decrease was due to a decrease of the CK-M subunit activity, while the CK-B subunit was elevated. The muscle CK-MB activity was considerably elevated in muscular dystrophies (P less than 0.02) and myositis (P less than 0.001), but it was also slightly elevated in neurogenic conditions. The similarity of the muscle CK isoenzyme pattern in neurogenic atrophies and myotonic dystrophy was noted. These findings could possibly reflect considerable difference in the regeneration process of neurogenic atrophies and muscular dystrophies.\r"

  ".W": "The major pathological abnormalities of HIV encephalopathy are infiltrates of macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, microglial nodules and demyelination. Elevated myelin basic protein (MBP) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provide a marker for central nervous system demyelination. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible role of CSF MBP as a useful and early marker for HIV encephalopathy. The CSF of 40 consecutive patients with HIV infection of various clinical stages was investigated, including 13 patients with clinical signs of HIV encephalopathy. CSF MBP was elevated in 2 patients (5.0 and 5.3 ng/ml), both of whom had moderate to severe HIV encephalopathy. The course of the disease was rapid in both patients. In the remaining 38 patients, CSF MBP levels were marginally elevated (n = 12) or normal (n = 26). Our results suggest that CSF MBP is not a sensitive marker for the diagnosis and evaluation of HIV encephalopathy, but may be an indicator of prognosis for the course of the disease. There were only few findings of elevated CSF MBP levels in patients with HIV encephalopathy in the current study, and this may be because the disorder progressed slowly in most patients. It is possible that CSF MBP levels in HIV encephalopathy may only be elevated with acute clinical deterioration but are normal in slowly progressive forms of demyelination, as seen in multiple sclerosis.\r"

It has been suggested that this antigen may play a part in the reduction of MSOLs, since nearly 100% of patients suffering from narcolepsy are DR2-positive. A multiple sleep latency test was performed in 37 patients suffering from MS without spontaneous complaints of sleep disturbances and who were typed for HLA-A, B, C, DR and DQ. The MSOL was reduced in a total of 21 patients, in only 7 of 15 DR2-positive patients and in 12 of 21 DQw1-positive patients. However, it was reduced in 13 of 16 B8- or B14-positive patients. In contrast with this, in the absence of an early sleep onset (MSOL greater than 30 min), no HLA antigens were found to be over-represented when considered individually; only those patients positive for a group of cross-reacting HLA antigens (B5, B15, B18, B21 or B35) had an MSOL greater than 30 min. These results suggest that the genes which code for the DR2 or DQw1 antigens, which are present in nearly 100% of narcoleptics, are not solely responsible for the appearance of an early sleep onset in MS.\r"

There were no substantial differences in suicide rate between different sites of tumor, although higher suicide rates were observed in patients with cancer in the lungs and upper airways (both sexes) and with gastro-intestinal tumors (males).

Hazard rates were consistently higher in males vs females during the second year after diagnosis, especially in males diagnosed after 1977-78. Registry data on prognostic factors, including white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis and Down's syndrome (DS), and initial treatment were used to interpret survival data by sex and year of diagnosis. A statistically significant sex difference in 4-year survival among cases diagnosed in 1979-80 was related to an unusually high survival rate (i.e. 100%) in females and the occurrence of two male DS cases. Further studies are needed on sex-specific survival rates among ALL cases diagnosed after 1977-78 in population-based cancer registries, which could be improved by more complete collection of data on immunophenotype and validation of data on relapses.\r"

There were problems with this retrospective dietary assessment, however, and the diet scores of the 27 stroke patients able to answer the questionnaire themselves fell between those of the other two groups. There were no significant differences between the three patient groups in plasma ascorbic acid or uric acid levels, but plasma magnesium and albumin levels were higher in the stroke patients. These findings were similar for patients aged over and under 70 but intergroup differences in magnesium and albumin levels were more marked in the elderly. These results do not support the postulated inverse relationship between vitamin C status and the risk of stroke.\r"

Data from a British prospective study of coronary heart disease are used in simulation exercises to assess the reliability of estimation formulae for both continuous and categorical risk factors. For continuous risk factors, a univariate formula based on estimation of the standardized relative odds (Whittemore A. S. JAMA 1981; 76: 27-32 [1]), gives reliable estimation of the required number of disease cases, provided the risk factor has a near normal distribution. An extension of the formula to adjustment for other risk factors, was less satisfactory, perhaps because of departures from multivariate normality. For categorical risk factors, an adaption of a univariate method for case control studies (Smith PG, Day NE. Int J Epidemiol 1984; 13: 356-365 [2]), gives reliable estimates of the number of cases required. However, this depends on approximate prior knowledge of the relative odds. In general, prospective studies of coronary heart disease risk factors should aim for at least 400 cases to enable sufficient accuracy of estimation.\r"

During a 9 year period (1972-1980) 250 patients (1.8%) were identified as warranting the term DD from a total of 14,098 admissions to a department of Internal Medicine. Their average stay in hospital was 11.5 days. There was no sex difference between the patients, whose average age was 42.8 +/- 17.6 years (mean +/- SD; range 14-93). Three complaints predominated: joint pains (21.6%), abdominal pain (20.4%) and chest pain (16.8%). In 103 of the patients, there was follow-up information until the diagnosis was made or for at least 24 months (average 53.0 +/- 40.0 months, range 2-186). These patients were representative of the original cohort in both age, sex and classification of symptoms. Forty-three patients (42%) were subsequently diagnosed. 58% of these patients were diagnosed as a result of a change in or appearance of a clinical symptom during the follow-up period. \"The survival of diagnostic uncertainty\" in 50% of the patients was 84.5 months (7 years) with a range of 2-13 years. This time was significantly shorter for chest pain than for abdominal pain (33 months vs 87 months) (p = 0.003). In patients with \"Diagnosis Deferred\", a diagnosis was reached in 42%; in 22% the symptoms disappeared leaving 36% undiagnosed, and a continuing clinical challenge.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the etiologic heterogeneity present in many diseases and the interaction among causal factors in the development of disease, relative risks relating any one exposure to a disease may be low, especially in the presence of common exposures. Nevertheless, in the design of epidemiologic studies, arbitrary values of relative risks are often used to determine the sample size required to detect an association between a particular exposure and a disease outcome. Such an approach may not yield adequate statistical power to detect an association. In this commentary, the authors point out the value of using the attributable fraction to determine an appropriate value of relative risk to use for sample size calculations. The approach is particularly useful in cluster investigations where the magnitude of the expected attributable fraction can be readily estimated from the observed and expected rates of disease. Specification of an attributable fraction is also useful in the design of case-control studies of etiologically heterogeneous diseases, especially when common exposures are suspected. Finally, the relationship among attributable fraction, relative risk and exposure frequency is valuable in interpreting results of an epidemiologic study and gaining insight into the differences in relative risk estimates found in various studies.\r"

Suggested changes to the scoring of the Barthel Index, and guidelines for determining the level of independence are presented. These modifications and guidelines were applied in the assessment of 258 first stroke patients referred for inpatient comprehensive rehabilitation in Brisbane, Australia during 1984 calendar year. The modified scoring of the Barthel Index achieved greater sensitivity and improved reliability than the original version, without causing additional difficulty or affecting the implementation time.

Therefore, we prospectively studied three methods to classify the severity of bleeding: a purely subjective implicit method, a previously published explicit method using brief criteria, and the bleeding severity index, which is a new explicit method using detailed criteria about the amount, rate, and consequences of bleeding. Three physicians independently reviewed abstracts of 168 patients treated with anticoagulants. The proportion of cases classified as major bleeding varied widely when the implicit method was used (2, 14 and 39%), less when the old explicit method was used (28, 40 and 47%), and not at all when the new bleeding severity index was used (20, 20 and 20%). Intraobserver agreement was excellent for both explicit methods (kappa greater than or equal to 0.95). However, interobserver agreement was better for the bleeding severity index (kappa = 0.87) than for the old explicit method (kappa = 0.69) or the implicit method (kappa = 0.39). We conclude that the classification of bleeding complications of medical therapy depends on the method used. In comparison to older methods, the bleeding severity index is highly reproducible and should be tested more widely to determine whether it can be applied to the burgeoning clinical research in anticoagulation and thrombolysis.\r"

This study extends observations on the relationship between height, weight, maturation and blood pressure during early adolescence into young adulthood. Standardized measurements of blood pressure, height, and weight were initially obtained in all 14-15 year old adolescents (N = 304) in a rural Kentucky school system. Measurements were repeated 5 and 8 years later. Adolescents with relatively high blood pressures continued to have higher blood pressures as young adults. Increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over time were related to increases of relative weight in both sexes (p less than 0.0001 and p less than 0.005, respectively), and in males increases of systolic blood pressure were related to increases of height (p less than 0.005). However, males who attained their full height at younger ages had higher blood pressures both during adolescence and subsequently, as young adults. Thus blood pressure of young adults is related to blood pressure in adolescence, relative weight and change in relative weight since adolescence, and in males to age of maturation as determined by the age at which adult height is attained.\r"

Over 27% of conjunctivae were classified as pink and 72.8% as reddish; the three observers agreed on 8.2% of the pink and on 49.8% of the reddish. Anemia (hemoglobin below 10.0 g/dl) was detected in 5.4% of the subjects with pink hue, and in 3.4% of subjects with reddish hue. Between 39.7 and 62.2% of the subjects with pink conjunctiva were misclassified as anemic by at least one worker, and between 20.0 and 50.0% of those with reddish conjunctiva were misclassified as not anemic. Overall agreement on conjunctiva hue for the 219 worker pairs ranged from 69.0 to 75.0%; the three kappa coefficients were between 0.27 and 0.34. The importance of conjunctiva hue variation will depend on the objective of the assessment and on the availability of laboratory tests. Bias due to conjunctiva hue should be stressed when clinicians and field personnel are under training.\r"

We here report the results of a more detailed analysis of factors other than duration of warfarin therapy associated with the risk of hemorrhage in these patients. Almost 7% of patients had a major hemorrhage on warfarin and an additional 23.7% had at least one minor bleeding episode. Age, female sex, and congestive heart failure were associated with small increases in the risk of major hemorrhage but not with the risk of minor bleeding. A prothrombin time ratio greater than 2.5 was associated with a fourteen-fold increase in the risk of a major hemorrhage (95% CI 5.1, 42.7), but major hemorrhages occurred in patients on warfarin at all measured values of the prothrombin time ratio. Taken together with the findings from our previous analysis, the study suggests that prevention of bleeding in patients on warfarin would best be accomplished by minimizing the duration of warfarin therapy, by scrupulous monitoring of the prothrombin time ratio, and by considering the \"therapeutic range\" for the prothrombin time ratio to be somewhat less than 2.0-2.5.\r"

Among 235 eligible patients, 227 (96%) participated in a home interview 3 months after diagnosis and 205 of these women gave a second interview approximately 15 months later. The Psychiatric Symptom Index (PSI) was used to measure the severity of symptoms of psychological distress. At 3 months, 38.8% of partial mastectomy patients had high PSI scores compared to 25.8% of women treated by total mastectomy (OR = 1.8, p = 0.044). Fifteen months later, percentages with high scores were identical, 35.1%, in the two treatment groups. Age appeared to modify the surgery-distress relation. These results suggest that partial mastectomy does not protect against psychological distress after breast cancer. Moreover, they highlight the importance of adequate preparation and support for all breast cancer patients, regardless of type of initial surgery.\r"

Eighty-nine cases ages 15-65 with a head computed tomography (CT) scan supported diagnosis of ischemic stroke were matched to 178 control subjects. Using information obtained by telephone interview, the patients were placed into three categories according to explicit criteria: classic migraine; common migraine; and no migraine headache. Overall, the association between migraine and ischemic stroke is significantly increased only in patients with classic migraine [odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-6.6]. In addition, classic migraine does not appear to increase ischemic stroke when hypertension, diabetes or smoking are present; however, when these other risk factors are absent, classic migraine is strongly and significantly associated with the risk of ischemic stroke [no hypertension, OR = 5.7 (95% CI 1.6-20.2); no diabetes, OR = 3.4 (95% CI 1.2-9.3); non-smoker OR = 4.3 (95% CI 1.2-15.0)]. Since none of the migraine patients in our study had a migrainous stroke, an underlying disorder other than prolonged vasospasm may be responsible for the observed increased risk. Our data suggest that classic migraine may be a marker for patients at increased risk for ischemic stroke unrelated to a migraine attack.\r"

All-cause mortality followed a \"U\"-shaped distribution, being greatest for the thinnest and fattest men at all ages, or about 1.5-fold for those with BMI less than 19.0 kg/m2 and BMI greater than or equal to 34.0 kg/m2, as compared with men of normal weight (BMI 22.0-24.9 kg/m2). Mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) increased with increasing BMI beyond the normal range. This depended mostly on the association of BMI with the biological risk factors of CVD. Mortality rates from CVD were also elevated among thin men under age 55, which could not be explained by the effect of the biological variables. Mortality rates from non-cardiovascular diseases, including cancers were inversely related to BMI among men of all ages. The high overall mortality of thin men was partly but not entirely attributable to smoking, low social class and antecedent disease. We conclude that both thinness and overweight are detrimental to longevity, but through differing mechanisms and disease patterns.\r"

DESIGN: Survey using multiple-choice questionnaire and open comments for students, housestaff, and faculty, and a structured interview of patients. SETTING: Major teaching hospitals on the campus of a midwestern medical school, staffed by full-time faculty. PARTICIPANTS: 136 medical students, 58 housestaff, 66 faculty, and 73 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 85% of patients liked the case presentation discussion at the bedside, but 95% of both students and housestaff felt more comfortable with such discussion away from the patient. Attending faculty were about evenly divided in preference, with the younger staff preferring the conference room setting. Most patients (88%) opposed rounds in the hallway. Duration of rounds of one to two hours was felt desirable by most, but 50% of students preferred a duration of less than one hour. For length of new patient case presentation, 60% of learners again favored brevity, less than 5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside rounds are an opportunity to sharpen diagnostic skills and to demonstrate the art of medicine. They are undervalued by learners and younger faculty but appreciated by patients. The authors recommend that faculty improve bedside rounds by assessing team members' educational needs, by cultivating sensitivity and respect for the needs of all parties, and by assuring pertinence and brevity of bedside discussion.\r"

Mean ratings replicated those reported by Kern et al. (r = 0.70 to 0.97, p less than 0.004). Using additional data about current practice patterns, ratings by general internists were compared with ratings by subspecialists. Both groups identified basic skill and knowledge areas as most important and felt that many areas related to practice management had been underemphasized. Most allied medical disciplines, however, were more important to generalists. Exposure to non-internal medicine areas seems important for residents considering subspecialization. However, all residents may benefit from increased emphasis on basic clinical skills and practice management. Program directors may want to address these issues, given the recent decline in applications to internal medicine programs.\r"

PARTICIPANTS: 14,340 U.S. and Canadian graduates taking the Certifying Examinations of the American Board of Internal Medicine for the first time in 1984-1987. MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS: Average program directors' ratings of overall competence were 6.70-6.78 for men and 6.60-6.71 for women. The greatest differences in ratings of specific components of competence were in the areas of medical knowledge and procedural skills, where men were rated higher than women, and humanistic qualities, where women were rated higher than men. Pass rates were stable over the four years of the study, and ranged from 85 to 86% for men and from 79 to 81% for women. Men consistently performed slightly better than women regardless of the type of residency or quality of medical school attended.

It is therefore possible that the task of introducing the practice of occupational medicine into primary care can be made easier by examining the experience of those who have already attempted to introduce preventive Cardiology Academic Award provides a potential paradigm for enlisting a cadre of 10 to 25 innovative primary care physicians who would begin to develop actual practice models and disseminate their findings about the implementation of occupational medicine in primary care. Introducing preventive cardiology into primary care has required that multiple barriers be overcome; it is not unreasonable to expect that occupational medicine will face many of the same barriers. However, if these barriers can be successfully overcome at the experimental sites, the result will be a group of primary care practices that can be used as models for the expansion of occupational medicine to primary care in general.\r"

Soft-tissue analysis of the nasal profile was done employing three angles commonly used in the photometric analysis performed for rhinoplasty: nasal tip projection angle, columellar angle, and supratip break angle. Maxillary movement was assessed in two ways: 1) horizontal and vertical component vectors of A-point movement were calculated, and 2) maxillary rotation, defined as the change in the angle of a line drawn from the anterior nasal spine to the posterior nasal spine relative to the anterior cranial base, was calculated. The component vectors of A-point movement and maxillary rotation were then used as predictor variables for change in the soft-tissue angles in a multiple-regression analysis. A weak correlation was found between A-point movement in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions and the nasal tip projection angle. When A-point was moved in an anterior and superior direction, the nasal tip rotated up. The converse was true with movement in the posterior and inferior direction. Only A-point movement in the horizontal dimension had a significant relationship with columellar angle. When A-point was moved in an anterior direction, columellar angle increased. This study shows that prediction of the soft-tissue profile of the nose following maxillary surgery is difficult.\r"

Nerve cell bodies were found within the structure of 40 of the 44 individual nerves (90.91%). There were two patterns of organization of the nerve cell bodies: isolated nerve cell bodies and ganglion-like clusters of nerve cell bodies. Because of the proximity of the submandibular ganglion, it can be inferred that these cell bodies are parasympathetic in function. The presence of nerve cell bodies in the lingual nerve in the third molar region could have possible clinical ramifications.\r"

Biopsies of the deep surface of the anterior superficial masseter muscle were obtained from five patients demonstrating vertical maxillary excess (VME), one at the time of corrective surgery, and a second at a long-term postoperative time interval (mean, 8 months). Control biopsies were also obtained from five individuals (three cadavers and two patients) with normal dentofacial morphology. A standard regimen of histologic and histochemical staining was used to classify individual muscle fibers as either type 1, type 2, or intermediate. In both VME patients and normal subjects type 1 fibers predominated, with the control group displaying a higher percentage (50% vs. 43%). On the average, type 1 fibers also had the largest areas. Following surgery there was an increase in type 2 fibers (30% vs. 52%). Two patients receiving maxillary surgery only exhibited either no change in mean fiber area or only a slight increase. The three remaining patients who underwent concomitant maxillary and mandibular surgery all showed a significant decrease in mean fiber area. Two persons in the latter group also showed features consistent with a denervation-reinnervation process. The results of this study indicate that the human masseter responds to surgical manipulation of the jaws in a histochemically demonstrable manner, with the nature and magnitude of the response associated with the particular surgical procedure(s) performed.\r"

Seventy-two allogeneic diaphyseal bone cylinders were chemosterilized to obtain autolyzed antigen-extracted allogeneic (AAA) bone and implanted in twenty 140- to 160-day-old rats. In 30 implants, porous hydroxyapatite biomatrix (HAB) was inserted into the AAA bone cylinders creating the composite implants. Serial sections from the specimens harvested at 23, 30, 45, 53, and 63 days showed that 84% of the AAA bone cylinders induced the differentiation of variable amounts of endochondral bone and that in 61% bone formed in the interior of the cylinders; 74% of the composite implants had no bone-inductive effect, recruiting instead macrophages and multinucleated giant cells at the HAB/mesenchymal interface. In all instances bone failed to form within the porous HAB or in proximity to the AAA bone matrix facing the interior of the cylinders. When present, bone formed only in localized areas within the matrix. Histologic analysis showed that high deposits of induced bone are correlated to high levels of matrix vascular invasion and mesenchymal cell aggregation. Within the limits of this study on rodents, the results suggest that the HAB inhibits and delays the local differentiation of induced bone in the composite implants.\r"

In this article an attempt is made to understand the poor-prognosis-with-psychiatric-diagnosis interaction through a literature review and an analysis of various problem areas that clients bring to substance abuse treatment. Problem areas were measured with a variety of instruments. The results show that groups that vary in severity of psychiatric problems also differ in severity of problems in other areas. As there is no doubt that such dual diagnosis patients pose a considerable treatment challenge, the implications of these findings for theoretical consideration and treatment planning are discussed.\r"

Patients entering a 14-day inpatient substance abuse unit were tested within a few days of admission with the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE), the screening test for the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery, and the Trail Making Test. Impaired neurocognitive performance was observed in approximately two-thirds of patients; the most frequently compromised areas of functioning involved attention and memory, calculation, abstraction, ability to follow complex commands, and visuospatial skills. Readministration of the NCSE prior to discharge detected a statistically significant improvement in attentional abilities, and a tendency toward improvement for verbal comprehension and abstraction. Discussion of these findings addresses several issues: (1) the frequency and degree of impairment in this population; (2) the observed variability of cognitive functioning; (3) the question of clinical improvement in neurocognitive functioning observed during a program of this length; and (4) a preference for the NCSE in this setting. The authors argue for the routine neuropsychological assessment of substance abusers, and discuss the above issues in terms of their implications for treatment at both the individual and programmatic level. Discussion of two cases illustrates the application of the NCSE, and the effect of finding organic impairment on staff attitudes and treatment issues.\r"

This article describes the problems presented by dual diagnosis patients in the urban, publicly funded, psychiatric emergency room. When such patients become acutely ill, neither the public health system nor the mental health clinician is adequately prepared to provide care. The inability to effectively treat these patients has become strikingly clear in recent years. In 1986, the Psychiatric Emergency Service at San Francisco General Hospital began to overflow with patients who required overnight stays. The intoxicated substance abusers with acute psychiatric complaints were the most difficult to manage clinically and administratively. Suggestions are offered for innovative approaches to this group of public patients: dual training of clinicians, flexible treatment programs prepared to deal with the whole person, and public funding that reflects patients' needs rather than clinicians' preferences.\r"

The tendency within the chemical dependency community to treat patients uniformly can militate against the individualized treatment planning that satisfies legal obligations to act in the best interest of the patient. The failure to adequately consider both the psychiatric disorder and substance abuse problem may create legal vulnerabilities that issue from the failure to refer a patient in need of medication or the failure to prevent the suicide of a patient in a situation where suicide is preventable. Patients suffering harm from acts of commission or omission of a chemical dependency treatment specialist have recourse through laws regarding negligence. Variations in the backgrounds and training of care providers create problems for the harmed patient in establishing a standard of care for the treatment of chemical dependence. However, the psychological symptoms of the dual diagnosis patient make it easier to establish a standard of care that may be legally cognizable. The chemical dependency specialist--of whatever discipline--has a duty to patients that requires sound assessment and disposition.\r"

All volatile anesthetics reduced hepatic UDP-glucuronic acid concentrations 50 to 75%. Biliary excretion of acetaminophen as well as the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates was depressed by all anesthetics for about 1 hr, whereas biliary excretion of the glutathione conjugate was increased during this time. Although total clearance, elimination half-life and steady-state volume of distribution were not altered, biliary clearance of acetaminophen was decreased by 39 to 50%. Formation of the glucuronide conjugate of phenol red and its biliary excretion were depressed by all volatile anesthetics; however, total clearance was increased by 15 to 25% during isoflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia. Total clearance and steady-state volume of distribution of digoxin were decreased only in rats exposed to halothane. There were no changes in biliary excretion. Urinary clearance of digoxin was increased by all volatile anesthetics, whereas biliary clearance was decreased by halothane and enflurane. Biliary excretion, clearance and volume of distribution of phenol-3,6-dibromphthalein disulfonate were not altered by the anesthetics. These data indicate that the hepatobiliary elimination of the glucuronidated metabolites is reduced in rats exposed to volatile anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacology of adenosine and angiotensin II (AII) suggests that endogenous adenosine could function to regulate some of the biological effects of AII. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that endogenous adenosine inhibits the ability of AII to potentiate noradrenergic neurotransmission and/or to directly contract vascular smooth muscle. Two approaches were used to assess the physiological import of adenosine-AII interactions on neurotransmission and vascular tone. First, the effects of exogenous adenosine and AII, separately and in combination, on vascular responses to periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) and vascular tone were determined. Second, the effects of an adenosine receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine, on AII-induced potentiation of vascular responses to PNS and on AII-induced direct vasoconstriction were examined. All studies were conducted in the in situ blood perfused rat mesentery. Intra-arterial and i.v. infusions of AII potentiated responses to PNS and increased vascular tone, whereas i.a. infusions of adenosine had the opposite effects. Intra-arterial infusions of adenosine potentiated the ability of i.a. AII to enhance responses to PNS; however, i.a. adenosine attenuated the direct vasoconstrictive action of i.a. AII. Intra-arterial infusions of 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine, at a dose which antagonized the effects of exogenous adenosine, did not alter the effects of either i.a. AII or i.v. AII on vascular responses to PNS or on vascular tone. These results indicate that although adenosine has the potential to regulate AII-induced enhancement of noradrenergic neurotransmission and AII-induced direct vasoconstriction, such regulation does not occur under the conditions of this study.\r"

To test these hypotheses we investigated: 1) the effects of ADO and AII on base-line HR and ALDO levels; 2) the effects of ADO on AII-induced bradycardia and AII-induced increases in ALDO levels; 3) the effects of ADO receptor antagonists [caffeine and/or 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine (DPSPX)] on AII-induced bradycardia and AII-induced increases in ALDO levels; and 4) the effects of ADO receptor hypersensitivity on AII-induced bradycardia. In the latter experiments, the animals were rendered hypersensitive to the bradycardic effects of ADO by administering caffeine for 1 week then abruptly withdrawing caffeine 18 hr before the experiment, i.e., caffeine withdrawal. Intravenous infusions of either ADO or AII decreased base-line HR and ADO reduced the bradycardic response to AII. Intravenous infusions of DPSPX attenuated and caffeine withdrawal potentiated AII-induced bradycardia without modifying AII-induced increases in arterial blood pressure. AII increased and ADO did not alter base-line plasma ALDO levels; however, ADO attenuated by 50% AII-induced increases in ALDO levels. Neither DPSPX nor caffeine altered the ability of AII to increase plasma ALDO levels. These results indicate that although ADO has the potential to modulate AII-induced increases in plasma ALDO concentrations, endogenous ADO does not regulate the effects of AII on plasma ALDO levels under the conditions of these studies. However, endogenous ADO, in some way, contributes substantially to AII-induced bradycardia.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible involvement of xanthine and xanthine oxidase in reperfusion injury in a low-flow, reflow model of liver perfusion. Livers were perfused at flow rates around 25% of normal for 90 min and then at normal flow rates (4 ml/g/min) for 30 min. When flow was restored to normal, malondialdehyde and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were released into the effluent perfusate. Malondialdehyde production rapidly reached values of 300 nmol/g/hr whereas LDH increased from basal levels of 100 to 600 U/l upon reperfusion. Trypan blue was taken up exclusively in cells in pericentral regions of the liver lobule under these conditions. Xanthine and hypoxanthine in the effluent perfusate increased steadily during the low-flow period reaching values around 5 and 10 microM, respectively, and decreased rapidly after the flow was restored to normal. Perfusion with nitrogen-saturated buffer for 3 min before restoration of normal flow rates or infusion of the radical scavenger catechin (400 microM) reduced cell damage by about 50%. Infusion of allopurinol (2-6 mM), an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, prevented reperfusion injury in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that a reperfusion injury occurs in liver upon reintroduction of oxygen which is initiated by oxidation of xanthine and hypoxanthine via xanthine oxidase and ultimately leads to production of lipid peroxides. Surprisingly, infusion of xanthine (4 mM), substrate for xanthine oxidase, reduced hepatocellular injury on reperfusion. LDH release was decreased from values around 700 to less than 200 U/l and trypan blue uptake in pericentral region was prevented totally by xanthine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of brain H2-receptors in opioid antinociceptive mechanisms, the effects of several antagonists of histamine H2-receptors were determined on morphine (MOR)-induced antinociception, opioid-mediated footshock-induced antinociception (FSIA) and on other opiate effects in rats. Zolantidine dimaleate (ZOL), the first brain-penetrating H2 antagonist (0.03-1.6 mumol/kg s.c.) caused a dose-related inhibition of MOR antinociception in both the tail-flick and hot-plate tests, with no effect on base-line responding. ZOL also inhibited opioid FISA with a similar potency. MOR-induced locomotor activity was also reduced by ZOL, but no effect was seen on MOR-induced hyperthermia, catalepsy or lethality. ZOL (10(-5) M) was inactive at mu, delta or kappa opioid receptors and showed at least 35-fold higher affinity at the H2-receptor than at receptors for serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine or acetylcholine in brain. To clarify further the role of H2-receptors in ZOL's antiopiate activity, the potencies of seven structural congeners of ZOL were determined on the H2-receptor and on MOR antinociception. Over 3 orders of magnitude, the rank order of potencies of the compounds for inhibiting MOR antinociception was highly correlated with their potencies as H2 antagonists. Cimetidine, unlike other H2 antagonists, potentiated MOR antinociception, potentiated opioid FSIA and increased brain MOR levels, actions that are not likely to be due to blockade of H2-receptors. These findings strongly suggest that stimulation of opioid receptors leads to antinociception by mechanisms that include activation of brain H2-receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Acute opioid physical dependence refers to the withdrawal symptoms precipitated by an opioid antagonist administered after a single dose or short-term infusion of an opioid agonist. This phenomenon is particularly interesting given that the abstinence syndrome has generally been thought to develop only after chronic exposure to opioid agonists. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimum time after agonist administration when antagonist-precipitated withdrawal could be observed. Naloxone (10 mg/70 kg) was administered i.m. either 0, 15, 45 or 90 min after single i.m. injections of morphine (18 mg/70 kg) in five nondependent male opiate users. Physiological and subjective report measures revealed no effect of morphine or naloxone at the 0 and 15 min morphine-naloxone interval conditions; however, before the naloxone challenge 45 and 90 min post-morphine, agonist effects (e.g., miosis, respiratory depression and good drug effect subjective ratings) were clearly evident. Naloxone reversed these effects to premorphine levels and simultaneously precipitated subjective symptoms and observer rated signs of opiate withdrawal. Thus, this study showed that antagonist-precipitated withdrawal in humans was first observed 45 min after agonist administration. Further, the onset of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal effects closely paralleled the onset of morphine agonist effects. The results of this study suggest that adaptational changes underlying the development of physical dependence begin within minutes after acute exposure to an opiate.\r"

The present study is an attempt to investigate the role of alpha adrenoceptors in the field stimulation-induced relaxations in isolated rat anococcygeus muscle. When the tissues are contracted with clonidine, UK-14,304 and low doses of oxymetazoline, field stimulation produced relaxations at lower frequencies, but not in the tissues precontracted with phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Relaxations induced by low frequencies were blocked by idazoxan, but not by phentolamine, prazosin, indomethacin, N-methyl-hydroxylamine, ouabain or 3,4-diminopyridine. When the tone of the muscle is raised by norepinephrine, prazosin reversed the field stimulation-induced contractions to relaxation responses. The data of the present study suggested the possible involvement of alpha-2 adrenoceptors during the field stimulation-induced relaxations of the rat anococcygeus muscle. To analyze and quantitate the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonism in the rat anococgygeus muscle, Schild analyses of clonidine-induced contractions against idazoxan were conducted either for idazoxan alone or after partially alkylating the alpha-1 adrenoceptors with phenoxybenzamine and by pharmacologic resultant analysis by blocking the alpha-1 adrenoceptors with prazosin. The Schild regression for idazoxan and pharmacologic resultant analysis suggested that the rat anococcygeus muscle responds to alpha-2 agonists with alpha-1-mediated contractions and idazoxan competes with alpha-1 antagonists for the same site, i.e., alpha-1 adrenoceptor site. However, the atypical Schild regression of idazoxan after partial alkylation with phenoxybenzamine indicated the existence of a second alpha adrenoceptor site in the rat anococcygeus muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The selective H1 agonist pyridylethylamine (PEA) and the H2 agonist impromidine (IMP) were utilized to characterize the central receptor subtypes involved in the central cardiovascular actions of histamine. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored directly via indwelling carotid catheters, and drugs were administered i.c.v. through permanently implanted cannulas. Central administration of PEA or IMP produced dose-dependent pressor responses and bradycardia. The H1 antagonist chlorpheniramine blocked the pressor response, but not the bradycardia produced by PEA. In contrast, the H2 antagonist BMY-25405 blocked both the increase in blood pressure and the bradycardia induced by IMP. Crossover experiments were carried out to examine the specificity of the antagonists' actions. Chlorpheniramine failed to block the actions of IMP and BMY-25405 likewise was ineffective in blocking the actions of PEA. These results suggest that both central H1 and H2 receptors mediate the central pressor effects of histamine, and that PEA and IMP are selectively acting at their respective receptors in the brain. The heart rate effects appear to be mediated directly by central H2 actions, as BMY-25405 was capable of blocking the heart rate changes. The finding that IMP is less potent in the central nervous system, compared to its known greater potency in the periphery, suggests that peripheral and central H2 receptors may be pharmacologically distinct.\r"

In isolated collecting tubule it inhibits sodium transport and vasopressin-stimulated water flux, the latter presumably distal to cyclic AMP formation. Depending upon the tissue studied, vanadate also stimulates a variety of cellular reactions including adenylate cyclase, glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis. We studied the effect of varying concentrations of vanadate on N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive ATPase activity in microdissected segments of rat nephron. In proximal convoluted tubule and in cortical, medullary and papillary collecting ducts vanadate had no effect on enzyme activity. In medullary and cortical thick ascending limbs, however, vanadate significantly stimulated NEM-sensitive ATPase activity (medullary thick ascending limb, 241 +/- 14 pmol/mm/hr vs. 531 +/- 74 pmol/mm/hr; control vs. (1 mM) vanadate, respectively; n = 14, P less than 0.01). The stimulatory effect of vanadate on NEM-sensitive ATPase activity was present at 5 microM vanadate, a concentration that inhibited Na-K ATPase activity approximately 80%. Metabolic acidosis also stimulated enzyme activity in the thick ascending limb, and the effect of vanadate was not additive. Metabolic alkalosis had no effect on NEM-sensitive ATPase in the thick ascending limb, but the stimulatory effect of vanadate was still seen. These data document that the NEM-sensitive ATPase in thick ascending limb is different from that found in other nonmammalian proton secretory epithelia which are vanadate inhibitable. The results with vanadate plus metabolic acidosis suggest that both are acting via the same mechanism.\r"

Therefore, the enhanced hydrolysis of membrane inositol lipids by cholinergic agonists during this period may have a relevant role in cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study we have investigated whether exposure to EtOH to rat pups during the brain growth spurt, known to cause a permanent microencephaly, would alter muscarinic receptor-stimulated inositol metabolism in cerebral cortex. Female Long-Evans rats were administered 4 g/kg of EtOH, in two doses of 2 g/kg, by gastric intubation from postnatal day 4 to day 10. This treatment did not have any effect on the pups' body weight as compared to an equally handled, sucrose-fed group of animals. Blood EtOH concentration in the pups during exposure ranged between 237 and 283 mg/dl. Muscarinic receptor-stimulated inositol metabolism was measured in cerebral cortex slices of control and EtOH-treated rats at days 4, 7, 10, 12, 20 and 45 of age. Carbachol-induced accumulation of [3H] inositol phosphates was reduced significantly in EtOH-exposed animals on day 7 and 10, but not at other ages. This decrease was not due to an alteration of muscarinic receptor density or affinity. Exposure to EtOH had no effect on phosphoinositide metabolism stimulated by norepinephrine, serotonin or histamine in cerebral cortex, whereas the effect of glutamate was increased. Similar results were observed in the hippocampus. An identical treatment with EtOH in adult rats did not cause alteration in any of the biochemical parameters of the cholinergic system measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice, bred for differences in initial sensitivity to ethanol, were found to differ considerably in the effect of ethanol on brain tyrosine levels. Brain tyrosine levels are decreased in both lines of mice over a 120-min period after ethanol, but the onset of the decrease occurs earlier (15 min vs. 60 min) and the extent of the decrease is greater (39% vs. 18%) in LS mice. This phenomenon is apparently related to the greater central nervous system ethanol sensitivity of LS mice, inasmuch as prior administration of tyrosine will prevent the ethanol-induced decrease in brain tyrosine levels and result in a decrease in the ethanol-induced sleep times of LS mice. An earlier study suggested a relationship between decreased catecholamine turnover in certain brain regions of LS mice and their greater ethanol sensitivity. The present observation that tyrosine pretreatment prevents or attenuates these ethanol-induced decreases in catecholamine turnover, while ethanol sensitivity is reduced, provides additional support for this apparent relationship. If the mice are pretreated with agents (large neutral amino acids) that lower brain tyrosine, the ethanol sensitivity (sleep times) increases in both lines of mice. The increased sensitivity is associated with marked decreases in brain region catecholamine turnover in both the LS and SS mice. These results are consistent with a role for catecholamine neuronal systems in mediating some of the intoxicating actions of ethanol, in general, and the differences in LS/SS ethanol sensitivity in particular.\r"

The striatal M2 muscarinic receptor was identified by its inhibition of [3H]cyclic AMP levels, whereas the brainstem M2 receptor was characterized using competition with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. The potency of pirenzepine does not differentiate clearly between the striatal M2 receptor (Ki approximately 300 nM) and the brainstem M2 receptor (Ki = 219 nM) or peripheral M2 receptors. In the present study, we used 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methbromide, hexahydrosiladifenidol, AF-DX 116 and methoctramine to characterize the striatal and brainstem M2 receptors in more pharmacological detail. For comparison, the potencies of these antagonists were also measured at cortical M2 receptors (using competition with [3H]pirenzepine binding). The potencies of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methbromide (KB = 0.19 nM) and hexahydrosiladifenidol (KB = 14 nM) in blocking the striatal M2 receptor suggested similarity to those M2 receptors localized in certain smooth muscles or in glands. However, AF-DX 116 (KB = 155 nM) and methoctramine (KB = 47 nM) were considerably more potent in blocking the striatal M2 receptor than as reported in functional studies in smooth muscle or glands. Thus, the profile of the striatal M2 receptor obtained with these antagonists did not match in all respects with either glandular (probable M4 gene product) or cardiac (probable M2 gene product) muscarinic receptors. In contrast, our data with the brainstem M2 receptor was highly correlated (r = 0.93) with literature data regarding the cardiac muscarinic system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) is known to be a potent centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor. In this report, the effects of THA in vivo and in vitro on the binding of muscarinic agonists and antagonists to putative M1 and M2 receptor subtypes were assessed in rat brain membranes. THA competitively inhibited labeled agonist and antagonist binding to membranes prepared from M1 and M2 enriched brain regions. The dissociation of radiolabeled antagonists from muscarinic receptors was decelerated markedly by THA. The half-time for dissociation of [3H]oxotremorine-M from the high affinity state of M1 and M2 receptors was unaffected by THA. Chronic THA administration resulted in a selective down regulation in the number of M1 receptors assayed directly with the M1-selective antagonist, [3H]pirenzepine. The decrease in the binding capacity of [3H]pirenzepine was correlated positively with the duration of drug treatment. Saturation analysis of [3H]pirenzepine binding confirmed that this loss in binding capacity was due to a reduction in the number of binding sites and not an altered affinity of the receptor for [3H]pirenzepine. Carbachol-[3H]pirenzepine competition revealed no change in the ratio of high and low affinity agonist states of the M1 receptor with chronic THA administration. In vivo studies demonstrate further that the total number of muscarinic receptors was decreased significantly, whereas putative M2 receptors, measured directly with the agonist [3H]oxotremorine-M or estimated by pirenzepine-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate competition, were unchanged. Thus, THA exhibits multiple actions at primary and secondary recognition sites on putative M1 and M2 subclasses of muscarinic receptors. The results suggest further that the clinical pharmacology of THA may represent a composite efficacy of THA at multiple sites on cholinergic synapses.\r"

  ".W": "BRL 34915 (Cromakalim) is a novel benzopyran that has anti-hypertensive actions. Contractile and 42K efflux responses to BRL 34915 were measured in blood vessels from the rabbit to determine whether Ca-dependent K-channels [K(Ca)] were involved. BRL 34915 increased 42K efflux from all blood vessels tested with an EC50 of 0.2 to 0.7 microM in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). BRL 34915 also inhibited norepinephrine (NE)-stimulated 42K efflux (96%) and contraction (50%) in SMA with IC50 values (0.2-0.3 microM) which were similar to the EC50. Comparison of two vascular sites showed that the portal mesenteric vein required 10-fold higher BRL 34915 to achieve a 42K response equivalent to the maximal effect on SMA, yet the maximum response to NE was 4-fold greater in portal vein than SMA. The 42K efflux stimulated by BRL 34915 exhibited a significant decrement with time. Ca-removal increased the magnitude and stability of the BRL 34915 response in SMA and femoral arteries, whereas reapplication of Ca in the presence of BRL 34915 caused the 42K efflux to decrease rapidly. These effects of Ca were not altered by nisoldipine (NIS). The 42K efflux stimulated by BRL 34915 and by K-depolarization was additive when applied in combination in SMA. BRL 34915 had no effect on the NIS-inhibited 42K efflux (a Ca-dependent component) during K-depolarization. It is concluded that BRL 34915 acts on K-channels which differ significantly from the known properties of K(Ca)-channels and that BRL 34915 indirectly inhibits NE stimulation of contraction and K(Ca)-channels by hyperpolarizing the smooth muscle membrane.\r"

  ".U": "89342237\r", 
  ".W": "Some classical and nonclassical muscarinic agents were tested for their effects on potassium-evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release from rat neostriatal slices. Release was monitored by measuring endogenous ACh when acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was inhibited with physostigmine (30 microM) or by measuring endogenous choline when AChE activity was left intact. The classical antagonist, atropine (0.1-2 microM), induced an increase in release whether AChE activity was inhibited or intact. The putative M-1 selective antagonist, pirenzepine, had minimal effects over a broad concentration range (2-200 microM) and induced an increase in ACh release only when AChE activity was inhibited. The classical agonist, oxotremorine (10-100 microM) decreased effectively ACh release (by 22-35%), but only when AChE activity was intact. The oxotremorine analog, oxotremorine-M, was apparently more potent than oxotremorine, but also decreased ACh release (by 24-41%) only when AChE activity was intact. Another oxotremorine analog, BM-5, behaved more like a muscarinic antagonist in its effects on neostriatal ACh release, and the highest concentration tested (100 microM) increased release (by 47%) when AChE activity was left intact. As in many other cholinergic systems, the agonists tested in this study were not selective in their action on ACh release modulation in the rat neostriatum. The antagonists, however, were more selective in their action, i.e., pirenzepine was relatively ineffective, and on the basis of this selective action, it can be concluded that modulation of endogenous ACh release in the rat neostriatum is mediated by a M-2 muscarinic receptor subtype.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent intestinal metabolism contributes to the first-pass elimination of felodipine in the rat. Four different types of experiments were performed. 1) [3H]Felodipine was given i.v. and i.p.; 2) the uptake of i.p. administered [3H]felodipine by the lymph was studied for 3 hr after dosing; 3) portal blood was collected quantitatively for 40 min after i.d. administration of [3H]felodipine; and 4) the in vitro metabolism of felodipine was studied in intestinal cell suspensions. The mean bioavailability of the i.p. dose was approximately 48%. The uptake via the lymph was negligible as an insignificant amount of the radioactive i.p. dose was recovered in lymph from a main lymph vessel in the peritoneal cavity. An average of 21 +/- 12% of given radioactive dose was recovered in portal blood during the first 40 min after i.d. dosing. The recovered radioactivity was to 40 to 70% due to felodipine and 9 to 16% was due to dehydro-felodipine. These results indicate that substantial first-pass elimination occurs in the intestine of the rat. Further support for gastrointestinal metabolism of felodipine in the rat was obtained from incubations with intestinal cells.\r"

  ".W": "The mass discharges of the carotid sinus nerve were recorded and the effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) antagonist on the 5-HT-induced alteration of the carotid sinus nerve activity was studied in anesthetized rats. The i.v. bolus injection of 5-HT produced a rapid and dose-dependent increase in the carotid sinus nerve activity. Pretreatment with a selective 5-HT3 antagonist, GR38032F (3 x 10(-8) mol/kg), caused a parallel shift to the right in the dose-response curve. A selective 5-HT3 agonist, 2-methyl-5-HT, also produced a dose-dependent increase in the carotid sinus nerve activity. GR38032F (3 x 10(-9) and 3 x 10(-8) mol/kg) pretreatment caused a parallel rightward shift in the dose-response curves. Neither methysergide (3 x 10(-7) mol/kg), which possesses both 5-HT1-like partial agonistic and 5-HT2 antagonistic actions, nor ketanserin (3 x 10(-7) mol/kg), a selective 5-HT2 antagonist, affected the 5-HT-induced increase in carotid sinus nerve activity. GR38032F (3 x 10(-8) mol/kg) produced no significant change in the NaCN (1 mg/kg)-induced increase in carotid sinus nerve activity. These findings indicate that the 5-HT-induced increase in carotid sinus nerve activity is mediated by the 5-HT3 receptor mechanism in the carotid body of the rat.\r"

This technique was used to determine the influence of low doses of clonidine (starting from 2 micrograms/kg i.v.) on the activity of the catecholaminergic neurons of the nucleus reticularis lateralis region, site of its hypotensive action, and of the locus ceruleus, which is involved in its sedative effect. There was a correlation between the hypotensive effect of low doses of clonidine (2, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) and the decrease of the neuronal metabolic activity within the ventrolateral medulla, whereas only higher doses of clonidine (50 micrograms/kg i.v.) decreased the metabolic activity in the locus ceruleus. Thus, we demonstrate in vivo differences in sensitivity toward the same drug of two different neuronal structures that are involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular and wakefulness functions, respectively. The present study also shows that clonidine has a preferential action on a medulla oblongata region that contains imidazoline-preferring receptors, namely the nucleus reticularis lateralis region, rather than on the locus ceruleus region, that contains mainly alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Slices of rat temporo-parietal cortex were prelabeled with gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA), in the presence of the glial GABA uptake inhibitor beta-alanine. The slices were then superfused with a medium containing the GABA transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid and stimulated electrically (5 min, 2 msec, 36 mA at 5 or 10 Hz), in the presence of the neuronal GABA reuptake inhibitor SK&F 89976A [N-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-nipecotic acid] and of beta-alanine. Representative experiments showed that the tritium released could be accounted for almost entirely by authentic [3H]GABA. The electrically evoked overflow of [3H]GABA was tetrodotoxin sensitive and largely calcium-dependent. Exogenous GABA, added to the superfusion medium at 3 to 30 microM, reduced in a concentration-dependent manner the electrically evoked (5 Hz) release of [3H]GABA. The GABAB receptor agonist (-)-baclofen, but not the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol, mimicked GABA and produced a concentration-inhibition curve almost superimposable to that of the natural transmitter. The effects of GABA and of (-)-baclofen were much more pronounced at 5 than at 10 Hz. The GABA-induced inhibition of [3H]GABA release was sensitive to the novel GABAB receptor antagonist beta-(p-chlorophenyl)-3-amino propyl phosphonic acid which, by itself, increased the [3H]GABA overflow. The inhibitory effect of GABA was not counteracted by the GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline or SR 95531 [2-(3'-carbethoxy-2'-propenyl)-3-amino-6-paramethoxy-phenyl-pyr idazinium bromide]. The results are compatible with the presence in the rat cerebral cortex of autoreceptors mediating inhibition of GABA release and belonging to the GABAB type. These autoreceptors may be activated tonically under physiological conditions.\r"

Oral administration of S-8666 (3.2-316 mg/kg), furosemide (10-316 mg/kg) and trichlormethiazide (TCM; 0.01-10 mg/kg) caused natriuresis in a dose-dependent manner. However, the dose-response relationships for Ca++ and Na+ excretion differed slightly among these drugs. Na+ excretion was enhanced to the same extent by both S-8666 and furosemide, whereas Ca++ excretion induced by S-8666 was much smaller than that induced by furosemide. In the TCM group, there was no correlation between urinary excretion of Na+ and Ca++, but this was, if anything, a negative correlation. In the furosemide group, there was a highly significant positive correlation between these parameters with the slope of the regression line being 0.30 (g/Eq). In the S-8666 group, there was positive correlation between these parameters, but the slope of the regression line (0.13) was significantly lower than that in the furosemide group. The pattern of urinary Ca++ excretion as normalized by Na+ in the S-8666 group was intermediate between those of the TCM and furosemide groups. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that S-8666 has an additional site of action which is common to that of thiazide diuretics.\r"

Intravenous bolus injection of S-8666 (3-30 mg/kg) and trichlormethiazide (TCM) (1-10 mg/kg) caused dose-dependent increases in Na+ excretion during furosemide-induced diuresis (primary, 10 mg/kg i.v.; sustaining, 10 mg/kg/hr i.v.), whereas injection of furosemide (5 mg/kg) did not. Ca++ excretion was decreased by injection of each drug. A significant reduction in Ca++/Na+ was observed at all doses of S-8666 and TCM. Additional natriuretic and hypocalciuric effects were lower in the S-8666 than in the TCM group. From these observations we conclude that: 1) S-8666 has a natriuretic effect which is additive to that of furosemide; 2) S-8666 attenuates the calciuric effect of furosemide; and, 3) S-8666 may have an additional site of action in the distal tubule.\r"

When cystathionine (100 mg/kg) was administered i.p. in rats, it was eliminated from rat serum with a biological half-life of 1.19 +/- 0.23 hr. Subsequent to the decrease of serum cystathionine, the concentration of cyst(e)ine increased up to 14.5 +/- 1.2 mg/l, and then decreased with a half-life of 4.12 +/- 0.82 hr. The concomitant administration of taurine (100 mg/kg) did not change the half-life of cystathionine (1.42 +/- 0.33 hr), but significantly increased the half-life of cyst(e)ine (19.1 +/- 0.56 hr). This effect of taurine was also observed when cysteine (100 mg/kg) was administered to rats. The liver injury was induced by the i.p. injection of acetaminophen (5.0 mmol/kg). The mortality rates, serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activities and the histological analysis of the livers, which were obtained from living mice, were examined 22 hr after the injections. Two administrations of cystathionine (5.0 mmol/kg x 2), one at 20 min before and one 20 min after the acetaminophen injection, prevented the acetaminophen-induced hepatic necrosis, completely. The coadministration of taurine increased the hepatoprotective activity of cystathionine, even at the low dosages (0.18 and 0.55 mmol/kg x 2). Moreover, the treatments using cystathionine, with and without taurine, restored the hepatic glutathione levels to 2.27 +/- 0.23 and 1.80 +/- 0.27 mumol/g, respectively. These levels had been depleted by acetaminophen injection to 0.96 +/- 0.18 mumol/g, 2 hr after the injection.

This increase was not additive and was prevented by prazosin (35.8 nmol kg-1), suggesting the involvement of alpha-1 receptors. At high doses (374 nmol kg-1 or more) clonidine inhibited acetylcholine release through alpha-2 receptors, as it did in naive animals at 7.5 nmol kg-1. Clonidine (374 nmol kg-1) and prazosin (35.8 nmol kg-1) reduced the objective signs of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Electrical stimulation of the locus ceruleus or naloxone treatment reduced the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from the exposed parietal cortex of morphine-tolerant guinea pigs. This reduction was not additive and was prevented by idazoxan (84 nmol kg-1), suggesting the involvement of alpha-2 receptors. Clonidine (7.5 nmol kg-1), too, reduced the release of GABA in morphine-tolerant animals. However, when tested jointly with naloxone, clonidine (7.5-112 nmol kg-1) induced alpha-1-mediated facilitation of GABA release (like that elicited in naive animals at 112-374 nmol kg-1) leaving the signs of withdrawal unchanged. This points to the stimulation of alpha-1 receptors highly responsive to this agonist (but not to locus ceruleus stimulation) during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. In conclusion, chronic morphine treatment modifies the alpha-1- and alpha-2-mediated control of GABA and acetylcholine neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reabsorption represented only 5% of perfused methotrexate, and appeared to be mostly of passive nature inasmuch as it was not modified by reducing the temperature or by ouabain. Cellular accumulation in nonperfused segments and secretion in perfused tubules were highest in the S2 segment and lower in the S3 and S1 segments. Secretion against a bath-to-lumen concentration gradient was observed only in S2 segments (with a maximum methotrexate secretory rate of 478 +/- 48 fmol/mm.min and an apparent Km of transport of 363 +/- 32 microM), and was inhibited by probenecid and folate. The low capacity for methotrexate secretion may be explained by a low capacity of transport across the basolateral membrane of the proximal cell as methotrexate was accumulated only to a low extent in nonperfused tubules (tissue water to medium concentration ratio of 8.2 +/- 1 in S2 segments). During secretion a small amount of methotrexate was metabolized; the nature of the metabolite(s) remains to be defined.\r"

An analysis of the association kinetics suggested a single binding site but the data from the dissociation experiments were better described by a two-site model. Examination of saturation curves at equilibrium revealed a single class of binding sites in the neostriatum from both species (rat: maximum binding capacity (Bmax) = 247 fmol/mg of protein; rabbit: Bmax = 337 fmol/mg of protein). In cortical regions known to possess a distinct dopaminergic innervation (piriform-entorhinal areas and cingulate cortex) the Bmax values ranged between 9 and 22 fmol/mg of protein. [3H]Raclopride binding sites (less than 12 fmol/mg of protein) were also detectable in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus as well as in the somatosensory and visual cortices. The selectivity in the neostriatum was examined by competition experiments with dopaminergic drugs. The rank of potency of agonists and antagonists to displace [3H]raclopride binding revealed its selectivity for the dopamine D2 receptor and was essentially the same for both species. Antagonist competition curves could be fitted to a single site but inhibition by agonists was better described assuming a two-site model. The stereospecificity of binding was demonstrated by the use of the enantiomer pairs. These results validate the utilization of the novel benzamide [3H]raclopride as a selective marker of dopamine D2 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the mode of action of the potent antagonist ICI 170,809 in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2 receptor system of arterial smooth muscle. We used isolated preparations from rat tail artery and calf coronary artery with the endothelium rubbed off. In tail artery ICI 170,809 (0.3-30 nM) antagonized surmountably and nearly competitively the contractile effects of 5-HT (pKB = 10.0) and partially prevented the depression of 5-HT-induced contractions caused by methysergide. Increasing methysergide concentrations gradually prevented the protective effect of ICI 170,809. The combination of 30 nM ICI 170,809 with 300 nM of its demethylated analog ICI 169,369 (pKB = 8.8) caused surmountable blockade of the effects of 5-HT as expected from competition of the three drugs for the same receptor. In calf coronary artery ICI 170,809 (1-100 nM) reduced the maximum contractile response to 5-HT by 35% and caused competitive antagonism (pKB = 10.4) of the remaining 65% of the responses to 5-HT. ICI 169,369 (100 nM) completely prevented the depression of the maximum response to 5-HT caused by ICI 170,809. Methysergide (3 nM) depressed the maximum response to 5-HT by 65 and 30% in the absence and presence of ICI 170,809. The results are consistent with the existence of two interconvertible states R in equilibrium R' of the 5-HT2 receptor. The equilibrium of R in equilibrium R' is shifted toward R' by methysergide greater than ICI 170,809 much greater than ICI 169,369.\r"

Our purpose was to determine if isoproterenol (ISO) reversed a BRADY-produced accelerated loss of intravascular fluid and protein into the interstitium of skin. An increase in microvascular permeability in canine hind paw skin was sustained by a continuous femoral artery infusion of BRADY (0.2 micrograms/kg/min). After 2 hours of BRADY, skin lymph flow (LYM FLOW microliters/min) increased nine-fold and skin lymph-to-plasma total protein concentration ratio (RTP) was substantially increased. Mean blood flow in the femoral arteries was increased four-fold by the BRADY infusion. After 2 hours of BRADY-induced increased permeability, five of the ten dogs were started on intravenous ISO (2 micrograms/min continuously) which increased heart rate from 182 +/- 15 to 222 +/- 11 beats/min. ISO reversed the increase in RTP produced by the BRADY. After 8 hours of BRADY, there was less tissue albumin in the dogs given ISO (14.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 29.5 +/- 6.6 mg/gram dry wgt, p less than 0.05 unpaired t-test). ISO can reverse the sustained increase in skin microvascular permeability produced by BRADY.\r"

An in vitro experiment with murine peritoneal exudate macrophages showed that PE and PS: a) stimulated the production of H2O2, complement factor C3a, prostacyclin, and thromboxane at a dose of 5 micrograms/ml; b) produced cell injury, evidenced by release of lipid peroxides, LDH, and by morphologic changes on phase-contrast and electron microscopy at a dose of 50 micrograms/ml; and c) caused cell death in 50-66% of cells at a dose of 100 micrograms/ml. An in vivo experiment showed that PE and PS injected intravenously into various groups of rabbits: a) caused only transient hypotension at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight; b) caused significant hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, bronchospasm, activation of intravascular coagulation, complement, platelets, and leukocytes with release of histamine, serotonin, and thromboxane at a dose of 0.10 mg/kg; and c) caused cardiac arrest and death at a dose of 0.30 mg/kg. In contrast, the phospholipids of the outer cell membrane (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol) caused minimal toxicity in vitro and none in vivo.\r"

Seven hundred eighty-four patients were analyzed in detail. The principal injury location was thorax in 41%, abdomen in 32%, extremity in 16%, head in 7%, and neck in 4%. In patients with head and extremity wounds, the mortality rate was clearly not a function of MAST use. In the chest, abdomen, and neck, MAST did not improve survival. Although the total prehospital time was 35.8 + 10.4 minutes for MAST patients and 32.5 +/- 10.7 minutes for No-MAST patients, 70% of patients with MAST had prehospital times greater than 30 minutes compared to 55% of the No-MAST patients.

The goal of this work was to provide clinicians with objective criteria to augment clinical judgment regarding surgical intervention in the impending compartment syndrome. A beagle model was utilized in which the Delta pressure (difference between the mean arterial pressure and compartment pressure) could be controlled. The model, in conjunction with 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), allowed a measure of high-energy phosphate compounds and pH in the compartment at various Delta pressures. The extent of ischemic metabolic insult in the compartment was then quantitated. Our data suggest the following: 1) lower Delta pressures result in a proportionally greater drop in the intracellular phosphocreatine ratio and pH; 2) at lower Delta pressures, there is proportionally greater decline in the percentage recovery post-fasciotomy; 3) blood pressure is extremely important and periods of hypotension may result in increased muscle damage at lower compartment pressures.\r"

Children were divided into three severity groups based on the Revised Trauma Score (RTS). Of the severely injured children (RTS less than or equal to 6), 79% required emergent operative intervention; 42% and 14%, respectively, required emergent operation in the moderately (6 less than RTS less than 12) and minimally (RTS = 12) injured groups.

Seven presented with narrowing of the costoclavicular space, and symptoms of intermittent brachial plexus impingement or thoracic outlet syndrome. Two of these resulted from resection of the mid-portion of the clavicle with subsequent impingement from hypertrophy of the lateral stump. Most commonly, hypertrophic nonunion of the clavicle caused the thoracic outlet syndrome, frequently many months after the initial injury. This delayed onset led to diagnostic confusion with other causes of radiating upper extremity pain, including cervical disc disease. Treatment of the adult clavicle fracture is different from that of the child with potential for greater functional impairment. The \"figure-of-eight\" harness frequently does not provide pain relief or adequate reduction of the fracture. If an acutely displaced fracture in an adult cannot be reduced and held by closed casting technique, open reduction and internal fixation may occasionally be indicated. We have found transcortical fixation by locking Knowles pins to be effective for treating hypertrophic nonunions, as well as for unreducible acute fractures. Atrophic nonunions require plate fixation and autologous grafting. Nonunion of the clavicle has been among the most responsive of nonunions in our experience, since all fractures treated by adequate reduction and fixation healed promptly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although this has increased interest in autologous transfusion and intraoperative salvage, little attention has been focused on efforts to enhance endogenous erythropoiesis as a method of minimizing exposure to homologous blood. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been shown to enhance erythropoiesis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of rHuEPO, administered postoperatively, on a model of acute blood loss. Eleven adult male baboons were randomized into two groups. All animals underwent a laparotomy and an exchange transfusion, with 6% hetastarch, to a final hematocrit of 15%. Group I (N = 6) received 1,000 units/kg of recombinant human erythropoietin daily for the first 14 postoperative days. Group II (N = 5) received an equivalent volume of placebo. All animals were given supplemental vitamin B12, folate and 200% of shed iron, as iron dextran IV, after exchange transfusion. Response was observed for a period of 35 days. All animals survived the protocol. There were no adverse reactions to rHuEPO or surgical complications. The hematocrits were similar between groups at baseline and after exchange transfusion. The maximal rate of erythropoiesis was significantly faster in the rHuEPO group (2.1 vs. 1.3%/day; p less than 0.01). The time required to return to hematocrits of 30% (9.9 vs. 17.4 days, p less than 0.001) and to baseline hematocrits (11.9 vs. 32.1 days, p less than 0.01) were both significantly shorter in the rHuEPO group. The data show that rHuEPO accelerates the recovery from anemia in the postoperative setting. Acceleration of erythropoiesis represents another alternative to homologous transfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sources of the sepsis in 30 of these patients included: abdominal abscesses--23, pneumonia or empyema--seven, acalculous cholecystitis--two, gangrene of right colon--two, and thigh abscess--one. In five other patients, the source of the sepsis was not found, even at autopsy. The mortality rate in the 30 patients with one or more identifiable foci of infection was 23%. In contrast, when the source of the sepsis could not be found, the mortality rate was 80% (4/5) (p less than 0.05). Factors associated with an increased incidence of abdominal abscess included: splenectomy, 75% (3/4); liver packs, 63% (5/8); 20+ units of blood, 57% (8/14); Class IV-V liver injury, 35% (8/23); 10-19 units of blood, 25% (7/28); colon injury, 19% (7/36); and open (Penrose) drainage of the abdomen, 11% (23/213). None of 82 patients without drains developed an intra-abdominal abscess. Thus early control of an identifiable source of infection provides the best results with sepsis following liver trauma. The most effective method for preventing intra-abdominal abscesses appears to be avoidance of drains in mild (Class I-II) liver injuries. The use of a closed system in the most severe injuries is still controversial and needs to be addressed in a prospective trial.\r"

Splenic macrophages were isolated 24 hours following trauma, cultured (24 hrs), and macrophage PGE2 levels were determined. In-vitro marrow proliferation was assessed as a measure of immune function. Crush-amputation injury increased (184%) macrophage PGE2 release. In contrast, glucan administration (pre or post) reduced PGE2 levels in macrophage supernatants (71% and 85%, respectively). A 52% decrease in in-vitro bone marrow proliferation was observed following trauma. Glucan pre- or post-trauma eliminated the suppression of bone marrow proliferation. In conclusion, macrophage-activating immunomodulators may exert beneficial effects following trauma by: 1) reducing macrophage PGE2 synthesis and release; and 2) reducing traumatic suppression of bone marrow proliferation.\r"

It is concluded that selective use of both procedures is appropriate as long as one recognizes the inherent limitations of each.\r"

To better define the effects of restraint systems on injury severity, the following study was undertaken. Parametric statistical tests were used for data analyses. For a 6-month period beginning February 1, 1987, all motor vehicle crash victims treated in the emergency unit were entered into the study (n = 613). There were 290 unrestrained subjects (UR), 254 restrained subjects (R), and 69 were excluded because restraint usage information was unobtainable. Unrestrained victims were younger (mean age, UR = 28, R = 32; p less than 0.05), and were more often male (UR = 65%, R = 51%; p less than 0.05). Hospitalization was more frequently required for unrestrained crash victims (UR = 59%, R = 26%; p less than 0.05). Length of hospital stay (LOS), including ICU confinement, was also extended (mean LOS, UR = 13, R = 10), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Injury Severity Scores (ISS) and Abbreviated Injury Scales (AIS) were tabulated and compared. Mean ISS was significantly higher for unrestrained victims (UR = 8.28, R = 4.44; p less than 0.05), and a higher proportion of unrestrained victims had scores greater than 15 (UR = 20%, R = 7%; p less than 0.05). Mean AIS was higher in all regions, although the difference did not consistently reach statistical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Among 572 men with impotence, age range 17 to 78 years (average age 54.8 years), 26 men with potential cavernosal leaks in absence of other factors were identified; 16 underwent DC; among these five had normal cavernous venous drainage. Eight men with abnormal cavernosal venous drainage required cavernous infusion flow rates higher than 120 ml/min to obtain erection and higher than 40 ml/min to maintain erection. Radiographic studies showed cavernosal leakage in all eight patients. Eight men, ages 39 to 61 years, underwent surgical ablation of abnormal cavernosal venous drainage. Among these, five men have had excellent results for up to 3 years. One failure was related to unrecognized penile arterial disease later shown by SPA. In two men small doses of papaverine now induce erection. We now recommend SPA before DC to rule out an arterial abnormality. Accurate identification of factors contributing to erectile failure is critical for successful treatment; in this experience candidates for correction of cavernosal leak syndrome were uncommon.\r"

Staged bilateral arteriotomy and stripping of intima of the common carotid artery was performed by means of a 2F balloon catheter under 700 mm Hg of pressure. At 3 months, after the control side artery was harvested (N = 24), the rabbits were assigned to three groups of eight animals each: (1) dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg, (2) cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 1 mg/kg, or (3) azathioprine 1 mg/kg intramuscularly. The animals were treated on the day before the contralateral intimal stripping and then were treated six times a week for 8 weeks; the vessels were harvested at 3 months. Twelve-week patency rates were 62.5% in the control group, 83.3% in the dexamethasone group, 100% in the Cytoxan group, and only 33.3% in the azathioprine group. The ratio of the luminal area to the area enclosed by the internal elastic lamina was used as an index of intimal hyperplasia, with a higher ratio indicating less intimal thickening. This ratio of the patient vessels was 0.74 +/- 0.14 (N = 15) for the controls, 0.79 +/- 0.11 (N = 6) for the Cytoxan group, and 0.91 +/- 0.06 (N = 5, p less than 0.05) for the dexamethasone group, which is statistically significant by means of analysis of variance. Occluded vessels had evidence of organized thrombus without any intimal hyperplasia. The decrease in intimal hyperplasia seen in the steroid group suggests a potential role for steroids in small vessel revascularization, but further studies are required.\r"

  ".W": "Budd-Chiari syndrome is an unusual form of portal hypertension caused by occlusion of the hepatic venous outflow, and it is often confused with portal hypertension caused by liver cirrhosis. Its prognosis is poor, and optimal therapy remains to be established. This is a report of 100 confirmed cases of this syndrome treated from December 1982 to March 1988 at two vascular centers in China. Sixty-two male and 38 female patients, 15 to 62 years of age (mean age, 32.6 years) were treated. Seventy-six patients had intractable ascites, 56 had esophageal varices, and 22 had upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There were 37 cases of membranous obstruction, 57 cases of occlusion of the inferior vena cava above the confluence of the hepatic veins, and 6 cases of occlusion of the hepatic veins. Eighty-one patients were operated on. Operative mortality rate was 8.6% (7/81). Follow-up from 2 to 66 months revealed that 58 of the patients operated on (72%) had good results, whereas 11 of 19 (58%) patients treated nonoperatively died within 2 months after admission. On the basis of these data we conclude that the operative procedure must be tailored to the cause and underlying pathologic characteristics. Mesoatrial shunting is the operation of choice for patients with occlusion of the retrohepatic inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, and inferior vena cava--atrial shunting is the operation of choice for patients with occlusion of the inferior vena cava and patency of the hepatic veins. Membranotomy is used for patients with inferior vena cava webbing, and mesocaval shunting is used for patients with intrahepatic venous occlusion only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Preoperative arteriography revealed a solitary lesion in 42 of 148 legs (28%) examined, and a combined lesion was found in the remaining 106 legs (72%). Incapacitating intermittent claudication, rest pain, tissue loss, or a combination of these was an indication for laser arterial reconstruction. None of the argon laser-treated lesions was treated with balloon dilatation, but since March 1988 all appropriate YAG laser-treated lesions were immediately followed by laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. The lesions in 64 of 89 legs (72%) treated by argon and 42 of 59 (71%) treated by YAG were successfully recanalized. However, successful angioplasty was performed in 44 of 89 (49%) and 34 of 59 (58%) lesions, respectively. The recanalization depended on the type of lesion (tight stenosis vs occlusion) and the length of lesion (localized vs total-length occlusion). However, the success rate of recanalization was almost the same as the success rate when both laser systems were used. Argon laser treatment proved successful in 19 of 20 (95%) segmental occlusions in popliteal arteries, whereas YAG laser treatment proved successful in four of five (80%) short segmental (less than 15 cm) occlusions of superficial femoral arteries and in 16 of 23 (70%) long segmental (greater than or equal to 15 cm) occlusions of superficial femoral arteries. In 26 of 36 (72%) total-length occlusions of superficial femoral and popliteal arteries, recanalization was not possible (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All surgeons had full-time or part-time appointments at the University of Rochester, 18 had special interest in vascular surgery, and eight had obtained a certificate of qualification in vascular surgery. Mortality rate was 1.4% (14 deaths), with additional permanent, nonfatal, neurologic morbidity of 3.4%. Mortality and morbidity were independent of surgeon, caseload, or hospital. Age and prior history of myocardial infarction influenced the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction but not the incidence of death or neurologic morbidity. Factors that increased the risk of postoperative death or neurologic complication included hypertension; contralateral carotid disease as manifested by stroke, endarterectomy, or occlusion; whether the patient was a woman; and symptoms of crescendo ischemia. Lack of preoperative neurologic symptoms was correlated with decreased risk of myocardial infarction and neurologic complications. Overall mortality and neurologic morbidity associated with operation for \"asymptomatic stenosis\" was 3.1% (seven of 222 cases). However, the incidence of contralateral carotid disease was high in the patients in the asymptomatic group (60%), and all complications in this group occurred in patients with prior contralateral carotid endarterectomy or occlusion (p less than 0.05).\r"

A survey of physician-owned companies indicates that 94% involve their physicians in one or more aspects of the underwriting process. About 60% involve their members in assessing the competence of physicians who have been sued and in advising the underwriters on decisions concerning both continued insurability and the conditions of insurance. During 1985, a total of 0.66% of the physicians in physician-owned companies had their insurance terminated or were forced to give up their coverage because of negligence-prone behavior. An additional 0.7% of active policyholders were subject to restrictions on practice or other medical sanctions and 1.8% to surcharges and deductibles. Thus, disciplinary actions were in place against 3.2% of insured physicians whose performance was viewed as in some way substandard. The findings indicate that the physician-owned companies are effective agents in identifying negligence-prone behavior, and suggest that these companies also play an important role in deterring substandard performance.\r"

  ".W": "The effectiveness of ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts is difficult to evaluate. Recent studies suggest that carbon dioxide excretion may be a useful noninvasive indicator of resuscitation from cardiac arrest. A prospective clinical study was done to determine whether end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation could be used as a prognostic indicator of resuscitation and survival. Thirty-five cardiac arrests in 34 patients were monitored with capnometry during cardiopulmonary resuscitation during a 1-year period. Nine patients who were successfully resuscitated had higher average end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressures during cardiopulmonary resuscitation than 26 patients who could not be resuscitated (15 +/- 4 vs 7 +/- 5 mm Hg). The 3 patients who survived to leave the hospital had a higher average end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure than the 32 nonsurvivors (17 +/- 6 vs 8 +/- 5 mm Hg). All 9 patients who were successfully resuscitated had an average end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of 10 mm Hg or greater. No patient with an average end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of less than 10 mm Hg was resuscitated. Data from this prospective clinical trial indicate that findings from end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are correlated with resuscitation from and survival of cardiac arrest.\r"

In the first stage, 298 men and 230 women were randomly selected from the missions, shelters, and jail in Baltimore to respond to a baseline interview that provided extensive sociodemographic and health-related data. In the second stage, a subsample of 203 subjects was randomly selected from the baseline survey respondents to have systematic psychiatric and physical examinations. Data are presented from both stages. Data from the first stage demonstrate, among other things, the high levels of disaffiliation of this population and their heavy involvement in substance abuse. Data from the clinical examinations demonstrate the high prevalence of mental illnesses and other psychiatric disorders and of a wide range of physical disorders and confirm the high prevalence of alcohol abuse disorders. The high rates of comorbidity of these conditions is demonstrated and data are provided on the subjects' needs for mental health and substance abuse services.\r"

During the same period, the number of first-year students who were white non-Hispanic females decreased 0.8%, the number of black non-Hispanic females decreased 4.8%, and the number of Asians or Pacific Islander females increased 13.7%. Women constituted one third of the entering class in the 1988-1989 academic year. During the past 5 years, the ratio of full-time medical school faculty to medical students increased from 0.88 to 1.08. About 4.8% of budgeted full-time faculty positions were unfilled, down from 5% in the 1987-1988 academic year. However, in the 1988-1989 academic year, more than 5% of positions were unfilled in microbiology, anesthesiology, dermatology, family medicine, neurology, obstetrics-gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, pediatrics, and surgery. Many schools are showing signs of adopting new curricular approaches. A majority of medical schools have implemented many recommendations of the GPEP Report, at least at some level. Problem-based learning is present in the curriculum of 82% of schools, mainly as an experience in one or a few courses. In about two-thirds of schools, computer-based instruction is a formal part of one or more courses or laboratories. Thus, the medical schools appear to be addressing the challenges presented by the changing environment of medical education.\r"

The number of GY-1 positions has not changed significantly during the past 3 years. The number of reported unfilled positions, including GY-1 unfilled positions, has increased each year since 1985. The total number of residents on duty decreased slightly in 1988. This decrease may be due to a lower response rate. The number of new entry residents (GY-1) has been decreasing since 1985. Thirty-nine percent of residents were training in family practice, internal medicine, or pediatrics. The number and percent of women in residency programs have remained steady. The percentage of FMG residents decreased slightly to 15.3% in 1988. The number of black non-Hispanic residents decreased in 1988, and the percentage of all residents who are black decreased slightly. The number of graduates of osteopathic medical schools in ACGME programs has increased 39% since 1986. The number of institutions involved in graduate medical education has not changed significantly during the past 3 years, although the number of institutions that are not hospitals has increased since 1983.

No significant risk for cancer morbidity or mortality was associated with depressive symptoms with or without adjustment for age, sex, marital status, smoking, family history of cancer, hypertension, and serum cholesterol level. These data were also reanalyzed for subjects aged 55 years or older who were retraced by a second follow-up.

The animals were infused for 5 hr with a 10% glucose solution or the same solution enriched with 0.24 M branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Hepatectomized animals were in grade-two coma at the end of the experiment independent of infusion. Indoleamines in mesencephalon-pons and diencephalon were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Serotonin receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2) were investigated in the cortex and hippocampus by radioligand binding studies using 3H-serotonin for analysis of 5-HT1-receptors and 3H-ketanserin for analysis of 5-HT2-receptors. Concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were significantly increased after hepatectomy compared with controls. Treatment with BCAA significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in hepatectomized animals. The affinity and the number of binding sites for the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors were found to be similar in all groups. The present study indicates that PCS for 1 week and the anhepatic state for 5 hr in rats do not influence brain serotonin receptors in contrast to previous studies in pigs with liver ischemia or rabbits with galactosamine-induced liver damage. In addition, infusion of BCAA for 5 hr did not alter the binding characteristics.\r"

However, 48 patients had indications for vitamin supplementation, but did not receive any. Analysis of data by indication for vitamin therapy revealed 125 indications for vitamin therapy in 83 patients. Of the 125 indications 54 were treated appropriately, but there were no vitamin prescriptions in 71 indicated instances.

HT patients had peak Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 3 to 10 for the first 24 hr postinjury. Patients were studied prospectively and matched for age, sex, and admitting weight Week 1 following the injury, SCI had mean UUN values of 0.18 +/- 0.04 g/kg/day vs 0.18 +/- 0.01 for HT patients. The mean MEE/PEE ratio was 0.56 for the SCI and 1.4 for HT (p less than 0.01). Over the entire study period the mean UUN value for SCI was 0.23 +/- 0.03 g/kg vs 0.21 +/- 0.01 for HT. The mean MEE/PEE ratio for SCI was 0.94 while HT remained elevated at 1.5 (p less than 0.05). Although the UUN was comparable in SCI vs HT, there was a significant difference in MEE/PEE between the groups. The elevation in UUN observed in SCI is not due to a hypermetabolic state. This suggests that different mechanisms promote the increased nitrogen excretion observed in these two populations.\r"

The caloric intake varied widely in individual patients and in different age groups. Despite unrestrictive dietary practices, the fat intake (33.7% +/- 8) was below that recommended for these linoleate deficient patients.\r"

Using Bayes' Theorem we calculated that for prior probabilities of catheter perforation of 0.01 and 0.05, corresponding posterior probabilities ranged from 0.1 to 0.15 and 0.35 to 0.49 respectively. This test should be used in all patients with new shortness of breath who have central venous catheters.\r"

There were five genotypes--namely, 1226/1226, 1226/1448, 1226/XOVR, 1226/?, and ?/? (where \"?\" indicates that none of the four known mutations was present). Severity of the disease was assessed with a scoring index according to age at diagnosis and extent of organ involvement. Mutation 1226 was associated with a mild clinical phenotype, and mutation 1448 with a more severe phenotype. Mutation 1226 is the most common cause of Gaucher's disease in Jewish patients.\r"

The scale was prospectively tested on 52 comparable patients admitted during 1988 and was found to be accurate with no falsely pessimistic predictions. The score is based mainly on clinical observations within 12 h of presentation.\r"

When the mother's rash appeared 7-3 days before delivery progressively fewer babies were born with antibody, and no infant born less than 3 days after the onset had antibody at birth. Infants were given 100 or 250 mg of anti-varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) shortly after birth or the onset of post-natal maternal chickenpox. 1 infant died, without neonatal varicella. Of the 280 surviving infants 169 (60%) were infected--134 (48%) with chickenpox and 35 (13%) without clinical features. The clinical attack rate was highest (60%) in infants whose mothers had chickenpox between 7 days before and 7 days after delivery. Chickenpox was severe in 19 infants, 16 of whom were exposed to maternal chickenpox between 4 days before and 2 days after delivery. There was no evidence that a severe outcome was associated with transplacentally acquired infection. Perinatal maternal herpes zoster did not cause neonatal infection. VZIG should be given to infants at risk, including those whose mothers have chickenpox during the last 7 days of pregnancy.\r"
