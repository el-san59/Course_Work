  ".W": "The adoptive transfer of type I diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice requires the contribution of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. To further elucidate the cellular pathway(s) of beta-cell destruction and the responsibility of each subset, high doses of committed T cells from diabetic mice purified to single subsets, were injected into syngeneic nonobese diabetic neonates. The recipients of single or mixed subsets were followed for clinical manifestations of diabetes and examined at 30 days of age for in situ lesions. None of the animals injected with either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells became overtly diabetic during the 30 days of observation whereas 8 of 23 mice inoculated with a mixture of the two subsets developed glycosuria and hyperglycemia. However, insulitis was found in 6 of the 13 mice injected with CD4+ T cells whereas only 1 of the 9 mice injected with CD8+ T cells showed marginal infiltration of the pancreas. The lesions initiated by CD4+ T cells alone were considerably less severe than those induced by the mixture of both subsets, corroborating the fact that overt disease did not occur in the former group. Together, these results suggest a distinct function for each diabetogenic T cell subset. CD4+ T cells, which have the capacity to home to the pancreas, promote in turn the influx of CD8+ effector T cells that do not by themselves accumulate in this organ. These results illustrate a novel form of T-T cell interactions leading to organ specific autoimmune lesions.\r"

  ".U": "91079590\r", 
  ".W": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease that includes the presence of lymphoid infiltrates in portal tracts, high titer autoantibodies against pyruvate dehydrogenase-E2 (PDH-E2) and branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase-E2 (BCKD-E2), and biliary tract destruction. The mechanism by which the autoimmune response is induced, the specificity of damage to the biliary epithelium, and the role of T cells in PBC are still unknown. To address these issues, we have taken advantage of a mouse mAb, coined C355.1, and studied its reactivity against a panel of liver tissue from normal subjects as well as a panel of liver specimens from patients with PBC, progressive sclerosing cholangitis, and chronic active hepatitis (CAH). C355.1, much like human autoantibodies to PDH-E2, reacts exclusively by immunoblotting with PDH-E2, binds to the inner lipoyl domain of the protein, and inhibits PDH-E2 activity in vitro. In addition, we have also attempted to develop cloned T cell lines that react with PDH-E2 and/or BCKD-E2 using liver biopsies from patients with PBC, compared with CAH. Although monoclonal C355.1 produced typical mitochondrial fluorescence on sections of normal liver, pancreas, lung, heart, thyroid, and kidney, it produced a distinct and intense reactivity when used to stain the bile ducts of patients with PBC. Nine of 13 PBC liver biopsies studied herein contained bile ducts on light microscopy, all of which reacted intensely at a 1:100 culture supernatant dilution of monoclonal C355.1. In contrast, although bile ducts of liver specimens from normals, CAH, and progressive sclerosing cholangitis also reacted with C355.1, such reactivity was exclusively mitochondrial and readily detectable only at a dilution of 1:2. More importantly, we generated CD4+, CD8-, alpha beta TCR+ cloned T cell lines from patients with PBC, but not from CAH, that produced IL-2 specifically in response to PDH-E2 or BCKD-E2.\r"

There is also strong evidence for a network of interacting cytokines, which has been only partially characterized so far, maintaining a proper balance. However, excessive or insufficient production of these mediators may contribute to certain disease states, particularly those with infectious and autoimmune genesis. Therefore the understanding of cytokine interactions may be helpful in elucidating the pathomechanisms of such diseases. Moreover, certain cytokines, as well as their analogues and antagonists, may prove to be of therapeutic value.\r"

  ".W": "Immunologic cytotoxicity is an important endpoint of the immune response to tumors, viral infected cells, grafted tissues, and exogenous microorganisms, and is also an important mechanism of disease, especially in autoimmunity. There are multiple mechanisms of immunologic cytotoxicity, but each has three major stages: leukocyte/target attachment, specific recognition, and target lysis following effector activation. Adhesion molecules present on leukocytes and potential targets appear to be involved in all three stages of cytotoxicity. A major factor in all types of cellular cytotoxicity is the interaction of LFA-1 on leukocytes and CAM-1 on targets. Modulation of ICAM-1 levels on target by the cytokines TFN-g, IL-1, and TNF-a is a major point of control of the susceptibility of targets to cytotoxicity by many different cytotoxic mechanisms. It also appears that modulation of the avidity of LFA/ICAM-1 binding is another important control point in modulating immunologic cytotoxicity. Cytokines also have important effects on immunologic cytotoxicity in ways other than adhesion molecule induction: effector priming to better respond to specific recognition signals, effector mobilization into tissue, and expansion of cytotoxic effector populations. ICAM-1 on the surface of epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes is likely to greatly influence cytotoxic damage of these cells in diseases as photosensitive lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, erythema multiforme, and vitiligo. It has been found that the epidermal staining pattern for ICAM-1 in each of these diseases in distinctive and different in each disease. It is proposed that disease-specific induction of ICAM-1 by factors such as UVR and herpes-virus is an important determinant in triggering these skin diseases and in determining the pattern of disease.\r"

  ".W": "We report on the levels of expression of IL-1 and IL-6 in skin from psoriasis patients. Different approaches were pursued. Initially, the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 were measured in suction blister fluid from lesional and uninvolved skin from psoriasis patients, using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and bio-assay. Skin sections were also examined for the presence of IL-1 and IL-6 using IL-1 beta- and IL-6-specific antibodies. Finally, the expression of IL-1 and IL-6 mRNA was determined in cultured keratinocytes (KC) and fibroblasts from psoriasis skin. Suction blister fluid from lesional and uninvolved psoriasis skin and from skin of healthy individuals did not contain detectable levels (greater than 100 pg/ml) of IL-1 beta. Blister fluid from psoriasis lesions contained low but significant levels of IL-6, whereas the serum levels of IL-6 in these patients was undetectable. Using cryostat skin sections and an IL-1 beta-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) in an indirect immunoperoxidase technique, a diffuse staining in the entire epidermis was observed in sections of uninvolved skin from psoriasis patients. In cryostat sections of psoriasis lesions, a faint diffuse staining of the epidermis and a pronounced \"dot-like\" intracellular staining pattern was observed. On the other hand, the same IL-1 beta-specific MoAb showed, in a indirect immunofluorescence technique using unfixed epidermal cells, bright membrane staining in epidermal cell suspensions from psoriasis lesions. Slightly elevated levels of IL-1 beta and IL-1 alpha mRNA were observed in cultured KC from psoriasis lesions as compared to those in normal KC and in the HEp-2 cell line. Very low levels of IL-6 mRNA were expressed in KC from psoriasis lesions and healthy individuals. Fibroblasts from psoriasis lesions expressed extremely low levels of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, but high levels of IL-6 mRNA. The results point to a paradoxical situation in psoriatic skin: blister fluid from psoriasis lesions contains no IL-1 beta, whereas IL-1 beta is overexpressed on the plasma membrane and in the intracellular compartment of epidermal cells. This finding may help in explaining the observed absence of IL-1 in aqueous extracts of psoriatic scales. Because cultured KC from psoriasis lesions express minimal levels of IL-6 mRNA. dermal fibroblasts, probably together with the inflammatory infiltrate, may represent a major source of IL-6 in psoriasis lesions in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of systemic sclerosis remains unknown, but cellular and molecular mechanisms possibly responsible for the characteristic clinical manifestations of fibrosis and vascular damage (Raynaud's phenomenon, telangiectasis, digital infection, and renal arteriopathy) are becoming understood in greater detail. One possibly important cytokine is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta); its involvement is reviewed here. With regard to vascular lesions, TGF-beta has variably been shown to inhibit endothelial cell growth in vitro but to promote angiogenesis in vivo, a paradox that remains unresolved. Nonetheless, an injurious activity of TGF-beta on microvascular endothelial cells could help to explain the intimal proliferation and microvascular obliteration seen. Whether as a result of or as a cause of endothelial cell damage, platelet activation has been well documented in systemic sclerosis and the platelet alpha granule pool contains a large quantity of TGF-beta. TGF-beta is also produced by activated macrophages and T cells, both of which are known to occur within systemic sclerosis lesions. An important effect of TGF-beta is its stimulation of fibroblast collagen and fibronectin synthesis and their deposition into the extracellular matrix. Stimulation by TGF-beta may therefore account for the fibrosis seen in the dermis and in the internal organs. Direct evidence of TGF-beta involvement in systemic sclerosis is scanty, and awaits discovery of either an abnormal expression of or response to TGF-beta. The biologic effects of TGF-beta appear to be regulated at the level of activation from a latent polypeptide precursor form. Descriptions of the importance of this cytokine in pathologic conditions will need to account for this activation and its regulation. Nonetheless, the physiologic effects so far attributed to TGF-beta make its involvement in systemic sclerosis an attractive possibility to explain some of the manifestations of this enigmatic disease.\r"

The abnormal topobiology, or altered spatial distribution, of mononuclear cells, which gives rise to disease-specific patterns, was described in molecular terms. A large number of diverse skin diseases were classified into six different groups, with each group highlighting distinctive cell types, adhesion molecules, chemotactic factors, and cytokines. The diseases within each group, which share functional anatomical reaction zones, were postulated to share common pathophysiologic pathways. Thus, it is now possible, as one scans the microscopic field, to look past the static images of red- and blue-stained cells and appreciate a dynamic and detailed medley of molecularly defined events emanating from the eyepiece.\r"

Eighty sets of three vials of human fibroblast interferon or placebo were labeled either A or B by a controller who maintained the code until the experiment was completed. Each patient received 0.1 X 10(6) units of interferon into the warts on one side and placebo injections into those on the matching extremity. Warts were measured each week and the progress or lack thereof was scored on a scale of -1 (worse) to 3 (cured). Therapy continued until either at least one extremity had cleared or the patient had received 10 weekly injections. A final evaluation was scored by measuring the total progress of each patient during the study. Sixty-four patients were treated to completion. More than 81% of the interferon-treated extremities were either cured or responded effectively to therapy. Only 17% of the placebo-treated lesions responded in this fashion. A statistical analysis of these data confirms the effectiveness of intralesional interferon therapy. The average number of interferon injections until cure was 5.9 +/- 1.7. No adverse effects were observed. The applications of interferon in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis and flat warts were also studied. Intralesional interferon beta was, to a certain degree, effective for benign lesions of epidermodysplasia verruciformis, but systemic treatments were not effective. Subcutaneous interferon beta was, in an uncontrolled study, effective in 45% of patients with flat warts.\r"

Moreover, both drugs have demonstrated an inhibitory effect on HIV replication. Based on the above, we combined IFN-alpha and zidovudine for treatment of HIV-associated KS in order to evaluate tolerance and clinical efficacy. Twenty-one homosexual men with histologically proved HIV-associated KS were treated in an open trial with rIFN-alpha-2a 18 X 10(6) IU every second day and zidovudine 800-1200 mg/d. Treatment was discontinued within the first month in six patients: three of them developed subjective intolerance, and three others contracted severe opportunistic infections or HIV-cachexia. Fifteen evaluable patients received combination treatment over a period of 2-20 months (average 10 months). The dosage was reduced as required based on drug-induced cytotoxicity. Complete remission was observed in four patients, partial remission in three, stable disease in two, and progression in six, resulting in an overall response rate of 46%. Negative p24 expression prior to treatment was a positive predictor. Although extracutaneous involvement had a negative influence on tumor remission, even patients with a mean initial T-helper cell count below 100 mm3 responded positively. In conclusion, combination therapy of rIFN-alpha-2a with AZT may effectively control HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma in more than 40% of patients. In contrast to monotherapy with IFN-alpha, patients with severely reduced immune systems will also benefit from combined treatment.\r"

We here report our preliminary experiences with low doses of recombinant interferon alfa-2b (rIFN alpha-2b) in the treatment of these types of KS, non-linked to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ten consecutive patients (eight patients with classical and two with endemic KS) with a median age of 62 years were treated long-term with 5 X 10(6) units of rIFN alpha-2b (Introna) given subcutaneously three times weekly for at least 6 months. Of the 10 patients, six presented with cutaneous disease only, and four had additional visceral involvement. After 6 months of treatment, seven of the 10 patients had a major response of the cutaneous lesions, and three patients showed stable skin diseases. Of the four patients with additional visceral disease, one patient showed a complete regression of an intramyocardial tumor involving the right atrium and ventricle, whereas in the three other patients stabilization of the visceral lesions with marked symptomatic improvement occurred. On the whole, the long-term results over a median duration of 12 months (range, 7 to 30) are also satisfactory: IFN-alpha continued to control KS in all patients. The treatment was generally well tolerated; no serious side effects were observed. Our preliminary data suggest that low-dose rIFN alpha-2b regimens are effective in classical and endemic African KS. However, further studies are needed to establish the exact role for IFN-alpha as alternative to radiation and chemotherapy.\r"

Studies of the value of interferons as adjuvant therapy in high-risk primary melanoma patients are necessary, but no results have been published to date. Human interferon alpha produces low response rates as a sole agent, but in combination with cimetidine, a 30% response rate has been achieved. Recombinant alpha interferons give responses of 15%-20% in advanced melanomas, and combination with cimetidine does not enhance the response rate. Recombinant alpha interferons have been used in combination with other interferons, cimetidine, monoclonal antibodies, and cytotoxics, with either no or small improvement in response rates. DTIC with recombinant interferon alpha-2a has been shown to produce objective response rates of 26%, with low toxicity and maintenance of quality of life. A randomized trial with DTIC as the sole agent, compared with combination treatment, is being conducted to determine the significance of this finding.\r"

Concomitant patients (stage I, n = 82; stage II, n = 33) with identical stages and prognostic factors without adjuvant therapy were used to evaluate the efficacy of rIFN alpha 2b therapy. No difference in 5-year relapse incidence and overall survival rates could be detected. However, it appears that patients of both stage I and stage II benefit from long-term adjuvant rIFN alpha 2b therapy, because during the treatment period (20 months), the incidence of relapses was lower in comparison to controls. After stopping treatment the incidence of relapse is equal in treated and control groups. According to the results of our study, we suggest using continuous low-dose rIFN alpha 2b therapy for adjuvant treatment of malignant melanoma.\r"

Clinical and histologic parameters were followed for a period from 6 months to 10 years. Complete clinical clearing of lesions was observed in 51 patients (62%) and most of them were in limited-plaque MF group or parapsoriasis en plaque. The mean total dose of PUVA for complete clearing was less for early MF. Thirty-one patients (38%) relapsed and responded to additional PUVA. Patients in early stages of the disease remained clear for up to 68 months after the first course of PUVA. Post-treatment skin biopsies with early MF showed histologic clearing. A new combination therapy for MF is presented in 15 patients. Recombinant interferon alpha-2a (Roferon-A), administered intramuscularly combined with PUVA were tested in a phase I trial. Interferon doses were from 6-30 million units three times weekly. Disease stages ranged from I-B to IV-B. Complete responses were obtained in 12 of 15 patients, and partial responses seen in 2 of 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 93%. The median duration of response exceeded 23 months (range, 3 to 25 months). All responding patients have been maintained on therapy. The dose-limiting toxicities were constitutional symptoms such as fevers and malaise (93.3%), leukopenias (40.0%), mental status changes consisting of depression and confusion (33.3%), and photosensitivity (26.6%). Interferon plus PUVA appear to be highly effective regimens for the treatment of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.\r"

Although various treatment regimens including IFN at various dose levels have so far not proved to have curative potential, a substantial palliative effect has been noted in hairy-cell leukemia and in some non-Hodgkin lymphomas of low-grade malignancy. Early stages of lymphoma disease are more responsive to IFN therapy, and this holds true also for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which IFN treatment is usually not effective in progressed disease after chemotherapy. Concepts of early-phase treatment and of remission maintenance by using IFN therapy are discussed on the basis of the data from several studies.\r"

  ".W": "We examined whether preincubating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with TNF alpha would result in an enhanced respiratory burst upon subsequent stimulation by various agents. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known primer of PMN, was used as control. We found that both LPS (0.01 to 10.0 microgram/ml) and recombinant TNF alpha (0.001 to 1.0 microgram/ml) act as direct stimulants of PMN as measured by chemiluminescence. Sixty minutes of preincubation of PMN with 1 microgram/ml TNF alpha or 10 micrograms/ml LPS resulted in similar priming for the respiratory burst elicited by opsonized zymosan, phorbol myristate acetate, zymosan, zymosan-activated serum, aggregated immunoglobulin, and f-met-leu-phe (FMLP) depending on the method of measurement used, i.e., chemiluminescence, production of O2-, and H2O2. Priming with TNF alpha for an enhanced response to stimulation by FMLP could be abrogated by anti-TNF alpha antibody. Cell-surface receptor numbers and binding-affinity constants for FMLP remained stable under conditions leading to priming. We conclude that TNF alpha is able to prime PMN for an enhanced respiratory burst to a similar extent as with LPS. Because PMN cell-surface receptors for FMLP are unaltered by priming, the enhanced respiratory burst seems to be due to changes in intracellular metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Monolayer cultures of the human melanoma cell lines StML-12, StML-11, StML-14 (third, respectively, twenty-fifth subculture), and SKMel-28 derived from specimens representing different stages of tumor progression were treated with 10-10,000 U/ml rTNF-alpha applied for 72 h. The effects of rTNF-alpha on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell viability, cloning efficiency, cell division, cell morphology, and the immunophenotype were studied in triplicate experiments. The cell line StML-14(3) revealed a significantly dose-dependent reduction of growth due to both cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of rTNF-alpha as well as a decrease of CE. Increased numbers of cells in prophase were observed 24 h after addition of r-TNF-alpha. In addition, dislocation of chromosomes in the metaphase, formation of micronuclei, and dose-dependent increases of cells exhibiting micronuclei and the DNA amount per cell were detected at the end of treatment. On the other hand, only a slight sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effect of rTNF-alpha was observed with StML-14(25) and SKMel-28, whereas StML-12 and StML-11 were significantly resistant. The last four cell lines were serially subcultivated and presented common phenotypic patterns with more malignant characteristics than the cell line StML-14(3) before treatment. Overall, rTNF-alpha enhanced the malignant immunophenotype of the cell lines tested. It increased the expression of the \"late\" melanoma progression markers A.10.33 and A.1.43, and Ki67, and it decreased the expression of the \"early\" progression marker K.1.2. The expression of HLA-I, HLA-DR, and ICAM-1 was also enhanced after rTNF-alpha treatment, whereas in contrast to other cytokines, rTNF-alpha did not induce the de novo expression of HLA-DR in HLA-DR-negative melanoma cell lines. These findings indicate that rTNF-alpha induces cytostasis and decreases cell viability of certain rTNF-alpha-sensitive melanoma cells. These effects may result in selection of rTNF-alpha-non-sensitive human melanoma cell populations with higher proliferation rates and a more aggressive immunophenotype in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "If one were to review articles on IFN published between 1957 and 1967 it would become apparent that virtually none of the tenets held then are still valid today. Whereas IFN was long considered to be a specific antiviral substance without any effect on normal cellular metabolism, we accept today that it affects normal cell division and many specialized cellular functions. In this respect it is not unique; IFN is a prototype of a family of similar substances now called cytokines that all appear to function as regulatory molecules. It was held that the production of IFN constituted a specific response to a viral infection. Today we believe that IFN is an integral part of a cytokine network and that they and other cytokines may be produced constitutively at low levels. These substances exert multiple effects on virtually all cells. They play an important role in host defense against viral and parasitic infections, and in the resistance to experimental tumors. IFN can be shown to exert effects on the immune system and on lymphocyte circulation. Lastly, because of the multiplicity of their biologic effects, they may even contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases. Thus, when large amounts of IFN are administered or induced in newborn mice they can cause liver, kidney, and pulmonary disease. The field of IFN and cytokine research continues to expand and there is an increasing number of therapeutic applications. Twenty years from now, scientists and clinicians may be surprised that we understood so little of how IFN act and how inadequately we used them to treat disease.\r"

  ".W": "The immunoregulatory, antiviral, and antiproliferative agents known as the interferons have profound effects on collagen synthesis. Interferons alpha, beta, and gamma suppress collagen synthesis by dermal fibroblasts. In addition, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) inhibits the constitutively increased collagen synthesis characteristic of fibroblasts derived from lesions of patients with scleroderma. IFN-gamma also inhibits collagen synthesis by myofibroblasts and synovial fibroblast-like cells. Inhibition of collagen synthesis by IFN-gamma is associated with a coordinate inhibition of transcription for types I and III collagen. In addition, IFN-gamma suppresses levels of procollagen mRNA and type II collagen synthesis in human articular chondrocytes. In vivo studies in mice have demonstrated that IFN-gamma inhibits the collagen synthesis associated with the fibrotic response to an implanted foreign body, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and the healing response to cutaneous thermal burns. In the latter case, while collagen content of the wound scar was decreased, hyaluronic acid was increased in mice receiving IFN-gamma compared to controls. This is in accord with in vitro studies showing that, while interferons alpha and beta decrease production of glycosaminoglycans, IFN-gamma increases production of glycosaminoglycans. Of interest, acute inflammation at sites of thermal injury, or when elicited by proinflammatory agents in separate experiments, also was suppressed in mice treated with IFN-gamma. The means by which IFN-gamma inhibits collagen synthesis involves transcriptional regulation. There is a single report that interferon alpha can decrease the size of a keloid of recent onset in a human patient. Because the interferons can inhibit collagen synthesis in vivo, further studies may be warranted to evaluate the usefulness of these agents in the treatment of disease states characterized by abnormal fibrotic responses as well as their potential for altering the healing response associated with particular therapeutic interventions.\r"

This study focuses on interferon-beta (IFN-beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by fibroblasts and epithelial cells in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Both these primary cytokines show multiple biologic activities in the skin. Their antiviral activity on fibroblasts is mediated by IFN-beta and not by IL-6. In addition, TNF-alpha and IL-1 have a growth stimulatory effect on dermal fibroblasts, which is not mediated by IFN-beta or IL-6. IL-1, double-stranded RNA, or virus are potent inducers of IL-6 and IL-8 on dermal fibroblasts, but they are less efficient on epidermal cells. IL-8 has been discovered as an early acting skin reactive factor responsible for the chemotaxis of neutrophilic granulocytes. Furthermore, IL-1 possesses delayed skin reactivity upon intradermal injection which presumably is mediated by local release of IL-8. These findings demonstrate that cytokines also interact in the skin and that dermal fibroblasts play an important role in the regulation of aspecific host defense.\r"

  ".W": "Activated polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMN) play an important role in propagation of inflammatory reactions and are capable of mediating tissue damage particularly by release of reactive oxygen species and lysosomal contents. Cytokines produced by monocytes as well as epidermal cells were recently shown to modulate PMN function. Therefore, the effect of immunomodulating cytokines on the oxidative metabolism of isolated human PMN was tested by functional as well as ultrastructural criteria. The following recombinant human cytokines were tested: tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha), lymphotoxin (TNF beta), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), M-CSF, G-CSF, PDGF, TGF-beta, interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, MONAP/MOC/NAF (IL-8), interferon-alpha and -gamma. Only TNF alpha, TNF beta and GM-CSF were found to be direct stimuli of the oxidative burst in human PMN whereas IL-3, IL-5, and IL-8 were active only at extremely high concentrations. None of the other cytokines tested induced any significant effect on isolated human PMN at physiological concentrations. The results clearly demonstrate that only selected cytokines are capable of inducing a long lasting activation of PMN oxidative metabolism. Release of these mediators represents a specific signal for PMN activation in inflammatory disease states.\r"

Fewer OPV (25%) than E-IPV (63%) vaccinees excreted OPV virus in stool after challenge. The mean stool virus titer was higher and the duration of shedding longer among E-IPV excreters. Only one E-IPV and three OPV vaccinees shed virus in the pharynx after challenge. Prechallenge serum neutralizing antibody levels were not statistically different among E-IPV vaccinees who did and did not shed virus; these levels were much higher than those of OPV vaccinees. Poliovirus-specific IgA levels in stool did not correlate with viral excretion. E-IPV was less effective than OPV in preventing and limiting intestinal infection, even though it induced higher postvaccination serum antibody levels.\r"

Cirrhosis, with or without ascites, was produced in rats by intragastric administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Histopathologic and laboratory studies demonstrated that CCl4-induced cirrhosis was similar to alcoholic cirrhosis in humans. Cirrhotic rats were more susceptible to type 3 pneumococcal pneumonia induced by intratracheal challenge than controls, and the presence of ascites was associated with the lowest LD50. More cirrhotic rats with ascites had bacteremia and elevated levels of circulating capsular antigen after challenge compared with cirrhotic rats without ascites or controls. Pulmonary clearance of pneumococci was markedly reduced in rats with cirrhosis and ascites and was associated with reduced serum complement levels. This model may be useful in further studies of the pathogenesis and therapy of pneumococcal infections in the compromised host.\r"

In contrast, most sera and saliva specimens from healthy adults had measurable levels of anti-SCP IgG and SCP-specific secretory IgA (anti-SCP sIgA). Paired acute and convalescent sera from patients with streptococcal pharyngitis possessed significantly higher levels of anti-SCP IgG than did sera from healthy individuals. Sera containing high concentrations of anti-SCP immunoglobulin were capable of neutralizing SCP activity. A survey of healthy adults and children also showed that the latter were significantly less likely to have anti-SCP sIgA in their saliva. Detection of this antibody in greater than 90% of the saliva specimens obtained from children who had recently experienced streptococcal pharyngitis demonstrated that children can produce a secretory response. This is thought to be the first report of a secretory IgA response in humans to a somatic antigen of Streptococcus pyogenes.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty cases of mediastinitis after coronary artery bypass graft operations in 1985-1987 were reviewed to determine risk factors. Two distinct clusters with a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain occurred in 1986. One resident was exposed to six cases but to only 5 of 24 controls (P less than .008). Cultures of his nares in January and November 1986 revealed the same MRSA strain as that of the cases. An attempt to eradicate the resident's nasal carriage of MRSA in January 1986 failed; eradication of his carrier state was achieved only after treatment with mupirocin. In a case-control study examining patients exposed to the resident, a prolonged duration of surgery (P less than .05) and a preoperative albumin level of less than 3.0 g/dl (P less than .009) were associated with mediastinitis with this MRSA. For the other 14 mediastinitis patients, who were not exposed to the resident, a preoperative albumin level of less than 3.0 g/dl was also a risk factor (8/14 cases vs. 8/43 controls, P less than .009). Thus, this study suggests that it is important to follow MRSA disseminators and to recognize that preoperative serum albumin levels are a risk factor for mediastinitis.\r"

  ".W": "An outbreak of measles among a predominantly unvaccinated and susceptible Amish population in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, offered the opportunity to test the hypothesis that secondary cases in households are more severe than primary cases because the former have more intense exposure and receive a greater virus inoculum. Of 130 measles cases reported between April and June 1988, 119 (92%) constituted a study of disease severity. Severity was assessed by determining frequency and duration of symptoms, length of any hospitalization, and number of days in bed. In a univariate analysis, fewer secondary cases had conjunctivitis (relative risk [RR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.96) and headache (RR, 0.37; CI, 0.15-0.86), but more had earache (RR, 9.69; CI, 1.8-202.9) compared with primary cases. Secondary cases had a shorter mean duration of coryza (4.0 vs. 5.0 days, Student's t test, P = .08). However, a logistic regression model that matched by family and controlled for age and sex indicated that there were no significant differences in measles severity among primary and secondary cases in households.\r"

The mortality of mice immunized with ciprofloxacin-treated E. coli was significantly lower than that of mice immunized with E. coli untreated or treated with other antibiotics. Sera from mice immunized with ciprofloxacin-treated bacteria showed better bacteriostatic capacity and enhanced production of antibodies that bound to homologous and heterologous lipopolysaccharide isolated from several smooth and rough gram-negative strains. The better protection observed in mice immunized with ciprofloxacin-treated E. coli was probably due to an enhanced production of antibodies to epitopes on lipopolysaccharide that became better exposed and so more accessible after treatment with ciprofloxacin.\r"

Antibodies to adenylate cyclase toxin were common in sera from individuals diagnosed with pertussis. B. pertussis lipooligosaccharide was also recognized by antibodies in some of these sera.

Because B. burgdorferi loses its infectivity after in vitro cultivation, the relationships between serial passaging of the organism in vitro, its susceptibility to elimination by phagocytes, and its infectivity were examined. When three different high-passage strains were incubated for 4 h at 37 degrees C with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, or polymorphonuclear neutrophils, 45%-67% of the organisms were eliminated. In contrast, two low-passage strains were resistant to elimination by phagocytes, and only 5%-6% of the organisms were removed after 4 h. All five strains equally stimulated the neutrophil oxidative burst, indicating that evasion of phagocytes was not a result of avoidance of recognition by these cells. The two low-passage strains were infective when injected into mice, whereas the three high-passage ones were not. These observations indicate that infectivity of the Lyme disease spirochete correlates with resistance to elimination by phagocytic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells respond to a variety of stress conditions by increasing the synthesis of a family of proteins collectively known as heat-shock proteins (HSP). One of these, a 65-kDa HSP that is highly conserved in many bacteria, is a major target of the immune response to mycobacteria. A gamma delta T cell clone from a healthy donor that recognizes not only the 65-kDa mycobacterial HSP but also the recombinant human homologue of this HSP protein was raised. Like alpha beta T cell clones, which recognize mycobacterial HSP, the clone requires antigen-presenting cells for antigen-induced proliferation and can also be directly activated via receptor cross-linking through CD3 or the delta chain of the gamma delta T cell receptor. These data suggest that the induction of a gamma delta T cell response by bacterial antigens could lead to the expansion of cells that respond to autologous proteins and, therefore, may result in the development of autoimmunity.\r"

The concentration-time data were best represented by a three-compartment model.

In group 1, trough concentration increased progressively (linear regression: y = 4.4x; r = .91, P = .001) without achieving steady state, and the renal clearance-to-plasma clearance ratio was 2.1% +/- 0.01%. In group 3, the elimination half-life after the last dose was 12.0 +/- 2.3 days. The elimination half-life of pentamidine was long and accumulation occurred with daily dosing even in patients with normal renal function.

Two strategies were compared: strategy I, brain biopsy with acyclovir (ACV) treatment for 10 days in biopsy-positive patients, and strategy II, ACV therapy without brain biopsy. Strategy I resulted in a greater 6-month survival rate when the likelihood of patients having HSE was less than 70%. Based on the current estimated prevalence of HSE (for patients with suspected HSE) of 35%, strategy I showed a slight advantage of a 3.2% increase in 6-month survival rate. An individual patient's chance of a positive brain biopsy can be predicted using a mathematical equation based on several important clinical assessments. This equation in conjunction with the decision analysis is a useful guide for the clinical management of patients with regard to brain biopsy.\r"

When stimulated neutrophils were present on the opposite side of the filter, migration of T. vaginalis into the filter was significantly diminished, and this reduction varied with the dose of neutrophil stimulus. The reduction of movement was abrogated by the addition of catalase and superoxide dismutase to scavenge oxygen metabolites. Studies with cell-free hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorite preparations indicated that the reduction in trichomonal trapping in the filter was due to chemorepulsion and not to a nonspecific decrease in motility or adherence. These findings suggest that active migration away from neutrophil products might be a means by which trichomonads avoid the microbicidal functions of host phagocytes.\r"

In the present study, an effective inhibitor of Candida albicans growth, previously detected in neutrophils cytoplasm and found to be released only after lysis of the cells, was identified as an abundant calcium-binding protein originally described in neutrophils as the L1 myelomonocytic antigen or the cystic fibrosis antigen. This substance was demonstrated also to have static activity against several other important human pathogens, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Growth of the various microorganisms was inhibited to considerably different degrees by the neutrophil protein, with the effects on S. aureus (the least responsive organism) being significantly enhance by addition of calcium to the medium. These findings suggest that after its release by the death of neutrophils at sites of tissue infection, this abundant calcium-binding protein could have a host defense function by controlling the growth of pathogenic microorganisms that escape being killed initially and would otherwise be free to proliferate.\r"

These variables were combined in an index that served to classify the patients into four groups with an increasing prevalence of multiresistant strains, Pseudomonas isolates, and isolates resistant to each of the antibiotic drugs in common use. For example, the percentage of isolates susceptible to cefuroxime in the four groups were 79%, 56%, 34% and 25%, and to gentamicin, 89%, 79%, 46%, and 33% (P less than .001 for both comparisons). The performance of the index was validated in a second group of 144 episodes of gram-negative bacteremia. The index kept its discriminative power. Compared with the prescriptions of the attending physicians, the index could probably have improved empiric antibiotic treatment in 24% of patients.\r"

Empiric dosing based on schedules suggested in the literature would have led to high peak and low mean concentrations of intrareservoir vancomycin. Patients with reservoir-associated infections have a variety of pathophysiologic conditions that can result in alteration of normal CSF dynamics. Pharmacokinetic analysis is useful to individualize dosing and to optimize therapy with intrareservoir vancomycin.\r"

Hybridizations with a probe from the long repeat region of HSV-2 revealed strong nuclear signals overlying neurons in sacral ganglia from five of nine individuals. The RNA detected overlaps with the transcript for infected cell protein O but in the opposite, or \"anti-sense,\" orientation. These observations mimic those made previously with HSV-1 in human trigeminal ganglia and confirm the recent findings during latency in HSV-2-infected mice and guinea pigs. Northern hybridization of RNA from infected Vero cells showed that an HSV-2 latency-associated transcript was similar in size to the larger (1.85 kb) latency transcript of HSV-1. Thus, HSV-1 and HSV-2 latency in human sensory ganglia are similar, if not identical, in terms of their cellular localization and pattern of transcription.\r"

At least 10 HHV-6 glycoproteins and 8 HHV-6 polypeptides associated with the surfaces of infected cells were recognized by human sera. The approximate molecular masses of glycoproteins immunoprecipitated by human sera were similar to those immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies. The labeling intensity of HHV-6 protein bands increased with increasing IF titer, and the effect was most prominent for HHV-6 glycopolypeptides. No reactivities with specific HHV-6 polypeptide(s) were characteristic of a given patient group. These findings suggest that HHV-6 glycoproteins are good targets for human antibody responses.\r"

Their toxicities were enhanced in animals infected at 1 day old with influenza virus, from 3-fold with staphylococcal gamma toxin through 14-fold for staphylococcal alpha toxin, 84-fold for endotoxin, and 219-fold for diphtheria toxin. No increased viral replication occurred in any tissue; thus the effects of the toxins were exacerbated by the infection, not vice versa. Neonates died suddenly without clinical symptoms as in human babies dying from the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Pathologic examination showed inflammation in the upper respiratory tract, lung edema and collapse, and early bronchopneumonia in the toxin- and influenza virus-treated animals but not in those treated with toxin or virus alone. Thus, bacterial toxins could play a role in SIDS, this being more likely with a concomitant influenza virus infection.\r"

Two synthetic HTLV-I sequence-derived peptides, Env-1 (amino acids 191-215) and Env-5 (amino acids 242-257), reacted with 92% and 100% of the serum specimens (n = 52) from HTLV-I-infected persons, respectively. Although a small percentage (8.6%) of serum specimens from persons infected with HTLV-II cross-reacted with Env-1, none of these specimens reacted with Env-5. Peptide Env-2 encoded by the envelope region of HTLV-II (amino acids 187-210) reacted with serum specimens from both HTLV-I (94%)- and HTLV-II (74%)-infected patients, whereas Env-6, another HTLV-II peptide (amino acids 238-254), reacted with less than 6% of the specimens. Therefore, the Env-5 peptide with amino acid sequence SerProAsnValSerValProSerSerSerSerThrProLeuLeuTyr represents an immunodominant domain of HTLV-I that is recognized by serum antibodies from all HTLV-I-infected persons. Moreover, the Env-5-based ELISA allows a categorical distinction between the closely related HTLV-I and -II infections.\r"

Although the mechanisms of the leukemogenic process are unknown, the tax gene may have a role in this process. Because clustering occurs with HTLV-I and ATL, members of ATL families were examined for antibodies to the tax protein and compared with matched HTLV-I-positive blood donors. To investigate the antibody response to this protein, a plasmid, pBHX-4, was constructed to express a recombinant tax protein (r-tax). For ATL patients and their HTLV-I antibody-positive blood relatives, the rate of seroreactivity with the r-tax protein was 67.3% (35/52), compared with 51.6% (97/188) for HTLV-I antibody-positive control blood donors (P less than .05). The difference between direct offspring of ATL patients and matched HTLV-I blood donors was even greater (84.2% [16/91] vs. 44.2% [42/95]; P less than .005). Thus, tax antibody positivity in direct offspring of ATL patients may reflect differences in time or route of HTLV-I infection. Alternatively, it might reflect genetic differences in host susceptibility or virus strain.\r"

Several EBV-encoded trans-acting factors activate the EBV lytic cycle, and one, ZEBRA (BamHI Z EBV replication activator; also called EB1), switches EBV from its latent to productive cycle. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were done using human cells transfected with a recombinant DNA-harboring cDNA sequence spanning BZLF1 (BamHI Z left frame 1) that was inserted downstream of the adenovirus major late promoter. IgG anti-ZEBRA antibodies were detected in a high proportion of asymptomatic HIV carriers and in AIDS patients but were absent in healthy control individuals. The presence of anti-ZEBRA antibodies in the sera of HIV-positive patients favors the hypothesis that EBV reactivates in such subjects. This finding may be of practical importance in the prognostication of AIDS development.\r"

None of the sera had HIV antibodies (upper 95% confidence limit, 0.5%); however, 103 (18%) had reactivity to HTLV. The profile of reactivity suggested that these subjects had been exposed to HTLV-II rather than to HTLV-I. Prevalence was as high in the early 1970s as today and correlated with duration of drug use rather than age. Neither cancers, specific neurologic diseases, nor excess deaths from any cause (overall 14%) could be ascribed to seropositivity. Therefore, HTLV (probably HTLV-II) has been a common infection of drug users for many years but adverse outcomes following infection were not demonstrated.\r"

By use of this clone with a focal immunoassay (FIA), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) producing HIV were detected in 15% of seropositive asymptomatic patients and 23% of AIDS patients at a frequency of 1 in 2 x 10(4) to 3 x 10(6) PBMC. HIV detection by primary FIA correlated with low CD4-positive cells counts. HIV activation in cocultures with PHA blasts resulted in increasing numbers of cells releasing HIV starting 3-4 days after cocultivation. The low incidence of HIV detection by direct FIA compared with the high incidence of HIV isolation after cocultivation with PHA blasts provided quantitative infectivity data suggesting that HIV was in a state of latency or low expression in most PBMC of AIDS patients.\r"

Similarly, neutralizing antibody was detected in fecal extracts from none of three experimentally infected human volunteers and only 1 of 15 naturally infected humans. The single positive human specimen contained occult blood. Only 2 of 19 saliva samples from naturally infected humans had significant viral neutralizing activity. In contrast, neutralizing antibody to type 2 poliovirus was present in most human fecal or saliva specimens tested.

In the current studies of IL-1-inhibitor effects, RSV-exposed cells were compared with autologous MNL that were sham-exposed or exposed to inactivated RSV or influenza virus (which induces net IL-1 activity and commonly elicits effective homotypic immunity). Exposure of MNL to influenza virus or inactivated RSV resulted in increased expression of human leukocyte antigen-DR, the IL-2 receptor, and the transferrin receptor and increased progression through the cell cycle by 3 days. In contrast, exposure to infectious RSV resulted in decreased marker expression and cell cycle arrest, with abrogation of proliferation in response to the virus or other stimuli. These data raise the possibility that a contributing mechanism for recurrence of RSV infection is early suppression of the clonal expansion of virus-specific lymphocytes due to net IL-1-inhibitor activity.\r"

In this study, the effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha/cachectin (TNF alpha), a cytokine with macrophage-activating properties, on HIV-1 replication in primary blood monocyte-derived macrophages was examined. Treatment of macrophages with recombinant human TNF alpha (rTNF alpha), starting before or after HIV-1 infection, consistently enhanced viral production fivefold or greater above control (P less than .01). rTNF alpha was active at low concentrations (0.05-50 ng/ml) and increased the replication of both lymphocyte-tropic (human T lymphotropic virus type IIIB) and macrophage-tropic (human T lymphotropic virus type III BaL) strains of HIV-1. These findings provide additional evidence that TNF alpha may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection by upregulating viral expression in macrophages.\r"

In contrast, the serum TNF alpha response following the induction of bacterial peritonitis was substantially less, peaking at 200-500 units/ml. Sterile peritonitis (essentially nonlethal) and bacterial peritonitis (greater than 60% lethal) elevated TNF alpha levels to 1000-2000 units/lavage within the peritoneal cavity 2 h after challenge. Passive immunization with neutralizing goat anti-TNF alpha IgG improved survival from 8% to 75% in rats administered LPS intravenously but was completely ineffective in protecting rats from lethal E. coli peritonitis.

The rise in TNF-alpha was followed by a rise in plasma IL-6 (27 +/- 12.8 ng/ml), peaking 30-90 min thereafter. Pretreatment with ibuprofen (n = 6) caused a significant augmentation and temporal shift in cytokine elaboration with maximal TNF alpha levels (627 +/- 136 pg/ml) at 120 min and IL-6 peaks (113 +/- 66 ng/ml) at 180 min. In ibuprofen-treated volunteers, the additional increase in TNF alpha was paralleled by increased levels of circulating elastase.

However, many recommend early operative fusion before evidence of appreciable neural compression occurs because 1) the myelopathy in these patients may be irreversible; 2) the overall prognosis is poor once symptoms of cord compression are present; and 3) the risk of sudden death associated with atlantoaxial subluxation is increased even in asymptomatic patients. The authors believe that rheumatoid arthritis patients in relatively good health without advanced multisystem disease and less than 65 years of age should be considered for operative stabilization if mobile atlantoaxial subluxation is greater than 6 mm. Seventeen patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis and atlantoaxial subluxation treated with a posterior arthrodesis are presented. A new method of fusion, devised by the senior author (V.K.H.S.), was utilized in all cases. Indications for operative therapy in these patients included evidence of spinal cord compression in 11 patients (65%) and mobile atlantoaxial subluxation greater than 6 mm but no signs or symptoms of cord compression in six patients (35%). Thirteen patients developed a stable osseous fusion, two patients a well-aligned fibrous union, one patient a malaligned fibrous union, and one patient died prior to evaluation of fusion stability. The details of the operative technique and management strategies are presented. Several technical advantages of this method of fusion make this approach particularly useful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Because of multisystem involvement of this disease, a high rate of osseous fusion is often difficult to achieve.\r"

Chromatographic analysis of the dopamine distribution after 10 days of infusion into either region revealed that ipsilateral delivery of dopamine did not result in contralateral increases in dopamine content. Examination of the adjacent striatum following ipsilateral intraventricular delivery indicated that dopamine had only penetrated 1 mm. Even with intrastriatal delivery, there were still parts of the infused striatum which had below-normal levels of dopamine. The fact that striatal tissue presents a significant barrier to the penetration of dopamine is discussed in relation to adrenal medullary and fetal nigral transplants.\r"

Methylprednisolone and U-74006F were equally effective at preventing neurological dysfunction compared to the control group (p less than 0.01); U-78517F was slightly less effective than U-74006F and methylprednisolone but was significantly better than vehicle in preventing neurological dysfunction. Delivery of methylprednisolone resulted in a significant decrease in tumor vascular permeability (p less than 0.006) while U-74006F and U-78517F had no effect on permeability. This suggests that U-74006F and U-78517F prevented tumor-associated neurological dysfunction by a mechanism other than decreasing permeability in tumor capillaries, and that U-74006F or U-78517F could prove useful in the treatment of brain tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells. Certain lipophilic cationic compounds, such as tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), are selectively taken up by a variety of carcinomas. Although preferential retention of TPP has been demonstrated for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this compound had not been tested previously on cells derived from nervous system tumors. In the present study, tritiated-TPP (3H-TPP) uptake and retention for eight different cell cultures of three histologically different types of nervous system tumors was measured and the data were compared to a positive control (MCF-7) and negative controls (normal African Green monkey kidney epithelium (CV-1) and the normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cell lines). Uptake and retention characteristics could be grouped by specific pathological tumor types, but individual tumor variability was notable. Malignant astrocytoma (grade III/III glioblastoma) and malignant neurofibrosarcoma cells showed preferential uptake and retention of 3H-TPP relative to meningioma cells and normal controls. A clonogenic assay utilizing the cytotoxic lipophilic cationic compound dequalinium showed strong retainers of 3H-TPP to be more susceptible to the effects of dequalinium than weak retainers. These data demonstrate that certain human and experimental animal nervous system tumor cell lines retain lipophilic compounds possessing a delocalized positive charge. Lipophilic cationic compounds may be useful in the intraoperative delineation of tumor margins and in the photodynamic therapy of certain nervous system tumors.\r"

In all three patients, the tumor occupied the pons, although in one it was predominantly located in the medulla. The cyst contents and nonadherent tumor capsule were removed in all three patients, but no attempt was made to remove tumor densely adherent to the brain stem. One patient's cyst was removed in one operation, but maximal resection in the other two required two operations. After surgery, sixth nerve function completely returned in one patient; another patient had a stable pontine gaze palsy but developed new facial weakness; and the third patient had stable cranial nerve deficits with a diminished hemiparesis. The last patient developed a pseudomeningocele and communicating hydrocephalus, and required a lumboperitoneal shunt. In all three patients, computerized tomography scans demonstrated hypodense tumors not enhanced by contrast material. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on two patients; in both, the tumors showed increased signal intensity relative to brain on T1-weighted images and decreased signal intensity relative to brain on T2-weighted studies. Magnetic resonance imaging, the most accurate modality for localizing these lesions and determining their extent, was also invaluable for postoperative monitoring and follow-up evaluation. Safe and adequate resection includes decompression of cyst contents and removal of nonadherent portions of the cyst capsule. Cyst wall adherent to the brain stem, however, should not be removed.\r"

A total of 73 patients underwent acute surgery (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 86 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 91 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Fifteen patients died before surgery was undertaken and another 20 patients died during the follow-up period. A total of 104 patients received nimodipine and the rest of the patients received either placebo (109 patients) or no medication (52 patients). A logistical regression analysis revealed the following prognostic factors for cerebral infarction, in order of importance: the amount of blood on the primary CT scan; postoperative angiographic vasospasm; the timing of the operation; and a history of hypertension. The use of nimodipine was associated with a significant reduction of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in patients who received intermediate or late surgery. In patients who underwent acute surgery no significant difference between the incidence of cerebral infarcts was observed.\r"

The goal of the investigation was to detect whether reduced platelet function is involved in rebleeds. Seventeen patients (21%) suffered a rebleed, six of those experiencing their first rebleed within 24 hours after SAH. Therefore, most platelet function studies were performed after rebleeds. Thromboxane release was lower in patients with rebleeds than in the others, both before and after rebleeding, although statistical significance was reached only in samples collected after rebleeds. Patients rebleeding within 24 hours after SAH had lower platelet aggregability (p = 0.037) than patients without a rebleed in the samples taken within 3 days after SAH. The results suggest that reduced platelet aggregability and thromboxane release are involved in rebleeds following primary SAH.\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine the correlation between prognosis and the histological features of nuclear atypia, mitosis, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis in supratentorial adult astrocytomas, the authors reviewed 251 such cases treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1972 and 1980. One point was given for the presence of each feature. The total number of features was translated into a grade as follows: none of the four features = Grade 1 (one patient), one feature = Grade 2 (36 patients), two features = Grade 3 (33 patients), and three or four features = Grade 4 (181 patients). The period of survival was significantly associated with grade, the presence or absence of each of the four histological features, patient's age, type of operation, radiation therapy, and extent of tumor (log rank, p less than 0.05). The variables associated with grade were age (p less than 0.001) and radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). After adjustment for these variables using a Cox proportional-hazards model, the difference in overall survival time between patients in Grades 2 and 3 was not statistically significant. When comparable groups of patients were examined in terms of age or receipt of radiation therapy, the median survival times differed markedly. Patients 50 years of age or less had a median survival time of 68 months (Grade 2 tumors), 29 months (Grade 3 tumors), and 13 months (Grade 4 tumors). Patients over 50 years of age had a median survival time of 6 months (Grade 2 and 4 tumors) and 9 months (Grade 3 tumors). Those patients who had received radiation therapy had a median survival time of 68 months (Grade 2 tumors), 21 months (Grade 3 tumors), and 11 months (Grade 4 tumors). Those patients who did not receive radiation therapy had a median survival time of 1 month (Grade 2 tumors) and 2 months (Grade 3 and 4 tumors); over half of these patients died within 2 months of surgery. This grading system, originally proposed by Daumas-Duport, et al., is simple, objective, and reproducible, and correlates well with survival times. The authors recommend that astrocytomas be graded on a scale of 1 to 4, with Grade 1 reserved for the rare adult supratentorial astrocytoma with none of the four histological features.\r"

Only one of these patients received corticosteroids, and none had an underlying endocrinological abnormality.

The symptoms ranged from simple neurogenic claudication and radicular pain to frank myelopathy. Myelography followed by computerized tomography were instrumental in the diagnosis of the first three patients; the fourth was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. The thoracic spine was involved in two cases and the lumbosacral area in the other two. The different treatment modalities were tailored according to the symptomatology of the patients. These included weight reduction of an overweight patient with minimal neurological findings in one case and decompressive laminectomy and fat debulking to achieve adequate cord decompression in the remaining three cases. Two patients improved significantly, the condition of one stabilized, and the fourth required a second decompression at other spinal levels. The various modalities of treatment and their potential complications are discussed.\r"

The patients were randomly assigned to alimentation with or without glucose. Systemic protein wasting, arterial concentrations of energy substrates, and cerebral metabolism of these energy substrates were monitored for 5 days postinjury. Both groups were in negative nitrogen balance, and had wasting of systemic proteins despite substantial protein intake. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose concentrations were highest on Day 1, but remained higher than normal fasting levels on all days of study, even in the patients who received no exogenous glucose. Although there were no differences in blood or CSF glucose concentrations in the two groups of patients, the glucose group had higher plasma insulin levels, with a mean +/- standard deviation of 14.8 +/- 7.3 microU/ml compared to 10.3 +/- 4.2 microU/ml in the saline group. The blood concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, pyruvate, glycerol, and the free fatty acids were higher in the saline group than in the glucose group. Cerebral oxygen consumption was similar in the two groups, while the cerebral metabolism of glucose and of the ketone bodies was dependent on whether glucose was administered. In the glucose group, glucose was the only energy substrate utilized by the brain. In the saline group, the ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate replaced glucose to the extent of 16% of the brain's total energy production. Cerebral lactate production and CSF lactate concentration were lower in the saline group. These studies suggest that administration of glucose during the early recovery period of severe head injury is a major cause of suppressed ketogenesis, and may increase production of lactic acid by the traumatized brain by limiting the availability of nonglycolytic energy substrates.\r"

The simultaneously measured intratumoral pO2 and pO2 in brain cortex surrounding the tumor were 15.3 +/- 2.3 and 59.8 +/- 6.5 mm Hg, respectively. Each intratumoral pO2 value was significantly lower than that of pO2 in brain cortex surrounding the tumor (mean less than 30 mm Hg, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p less than 0.005) and influenced the oxygen effects on radiation. These results appear to confirm that there are hypoxic regions within human brain tumors.

  ".W": "Hydrocephalus is a common complication of tuberculous meningitis. Case studies of 114 patients with tuberculous meningitis and hydrocephalus, who underwent shunt surgery between July, 1975, and June, 1986, were reviewed to evaluate the long-term outcome and to outline a management protocol for these patients based on the results. Seven factors were studied in each case: 1) age at admission; 2) grade on admission (I to IV, classified by the authors; Grade I being the best and Grade IV being the worst); 3) duration of alteration of sensorium; 4) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell content at initial examination; 5) CSF protein levels at initial examination; 6) number of shunt revisions required; and 7) the necessity for bilateral shunts. During a long-term follow-up period ranging from 6 months to 13 years (mean 45.6 months), the mortality rate was 20% for patients in Grade I; 34.7% for patients in Grade II; 51.9% for patients in Grade III; and 100% for patients in Grade IV. Only the grade at the time of admission was found to be statistically significant in determining final outcome (p less than 0.001). Based on these results, the authors advocate early shunt surgery for Grade I and II patients. For patients in Grade III, surgery may be performed either if external ventricular drainage causes an improvement in sensorium or without selection. All patients in Grade IV should undergo external ventricular drainage and only those who show a significant change in their neurological status within 24 to 48 hours of drainage, should have shunt surgery.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 2259 children with solid malignant tumors were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between the years 1962 and 1987. Of these, 112 (5%) developed spinal epidural metastasis with spinal cord compression during the course of their disease process. Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression was caused most commonly by Ewing's sarcoma and neuroblastoma, followed by osteogenic sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, soft-tissue sarcoma, germ-cell tumor, Wilm's tumor, and (rarely) hepatoma. There was no significant difference in outcome between patients with small-cell tumors (neuroblastoma, Hodgkin's disease, and germ-cell tumors) who received only chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and the patients with similar lesions who received a decompressive laminectomy alone or prior to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Patients with spinal cord compression from metastatic sarcoma (Ewing's sarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma) showed a significant improvement with decompressive laminectomy alone or before medical therapy, compared to those who received radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy without posterior decompression. Pediatric tumors invade the spinal canal via the neural foramen, compressing the spinal cord in a circumferential manner, allowing decompressive laminectomy (posterior approach) to be an effective surgical approach. Sixty-six percent of children who had no evidence of motor or sensory function below the level of the compression became ambulatory after surgical decompression and medical treatment, regardless of tumor type.\r"

The administration of the drug or matching placebo was started immediately after the radiological diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm had been made. Of the 213 patients enrolled in the study, 58 were operated on early (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 69 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 74 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Eleven patients died before surgery was undertaken and one was not operated on. A follow-up examination with CT scanning, performed 1 to 3 years after the SAH (mean 1.4 years), revealed no significant differences in the overall outcome between the groups. However, nimodipine treatment was associated with a significantly lower incidence of deaths caused by delayed cerebral ischemia (p = 0.01) and significantly lower occurrence of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in the whole population (p = 0.05), especially in patients without an associated intracerebral hemorrhage on admission CT scan (p = 0.03).\r"

In each case, hemorrhage extended into all ventricular chambers, and a cast formation and expansion of the third and fourth ventricles were found. Immediately after the therapy was started (within 7 days from onset of symptoms), reduction of intraventricular hematoma volume was observed on computerized tomography. On average, both the third and fourth ventricles became clear on the third day after hemorrhage; there was one exception, a case of ruptured aneurysm. Five of the six patients showed excellent or good outcome, although two developed delayed hydrocephalus. No infection or rebleeding was observed. The outcome in a retrospectively studied group of five patients not treated with urokinase is also reported. The authors conclude that this relatively easy method of treatment will greatly improve the prognosis of severe intraventricular hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic brain acidosis after trauma has been thought to be harmful and to contribute to neurological deterioration. Amelioration of the brain acidosis either by systemic buffering agents or by hyperventilation has been proposed as a method of treatment. The objective of this study was to explore with magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy the metabolic changes in brain that occur with the use of hyperventilation, THAM (tromethamine; tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane), and a combination (THAM and hyperventilation) therapy in experimental fluid-percussion injury. Brain lactate, brain pH, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and adenosine triphosphate levels were measured by 1H and 31P MR spectroscopy. Arterial and cerebrovenous lactate and water content in brain tissue was determined in 29 cats using the specific gravimetric technique. Following injury, the phosphocreatine (PCr)/Pi ratio, which is an index of cerebral energy depletion, decreased to 76% in four untreated animals, to 79% in 11 THAM-treated animals, to 68% in seven animals receiving hyperventilation, and to 66% in seven animals with combination THAM and hyperventilation therapy. The PCr/Pi ratio returned to a normal level in 8 hours in animals treated with THAM and THAM in combination with hyperventilation. The brain lactate index increased to 157% in the hyperventilation group after trauma. In cats receiving THAM plus hyperventilation, the brain lactate index was reduced to 142%, while the minimum rise of 126% was associated with treatment of THAM alone. In the THAM-treatment and combination-treatment groups, the water content of the white and gray matter was significantly decreased compared with that in untreated cat brains. Prolonged hyperventilation provided relative ischemia in brain tissue and promoted more production of brain lactate, no recovery of the PCr/Pi ratio, and no decrease in brain edema. On the other hand, administration of THAM decreased production of brain lactate and brain edema and promoted the recovery of cerebral energy dysfunction. It was found that THAM ameliorates the deleterious effects of hyperventilation by minimizing energy disturbance and that it also decreases brain edema. The authors conclude that THAM may be effective in reducing brain tissue acidosis and helpful as a metabolic stabilizing agent following severe head injury.\r"

Recovery may be related to two sources of dopamine: the grafted cells and/or the sprouted fibers from host dopaminergic neurons. The authors undertook this study to determine whether behavioral recovery requires release of dopamine by the implanted tissue, and to establish if nondopaminergic fetal central nervous system implants can induce sprouting of dopamine fibers in the primate brain and cause behavioral recovery. Rhesus monkeys with MPTP-induced hemiparkinsonism or full parkinsonism and a stable neurological deficit were used for this study. Cavities were created in the caudate nuclei anterior to the foramen of Monro via an open microsurgical approach. Fetal cerebellum or spinal cord was implanted into the preformed cavities of three monkeys. Control parkinsonian monkeys showed no recovery. However, implant-induced improvement was stable for up to 6 months after implantation. Sprouted dopaminergic fibers oriented from the ventral striatum and nucleus accumbens were found in the area of the tissue implant in the animals that received fetal grafts but were not present in the control monkeys. It is concluded that brain implants do not need to contain dopamine to induce functional recovery in MPTP-induced parkinsonian primates. Implant-induced and trophic factor-mediated dopaminergic sprouting by the host brain plays a role in the behavioral recovery and may well be responsible for the clinical improvement seen in parkinsonian patients after brain implants.\r"

Each of 10 cats, 2 dogs, and 3 snakes presenting with a variety of tumor types (squamous cell carcinoma, mast cell malignant tumor, and mixed carcinoma/sarcoma) was given an intravenous injection of 1 mg of CASPc per kilogram body weight 48 hours prior to irradiation with 675-nm light. Some larger tumors (greater than 1.5 cm deep) were surgically debulked prior to PDT. No significant systemic toxicity or skin photosensitization was observed in any animal. The tumor responses were comparable to those seen with conventional cryotherapy, hyperthermia, or surgery. PDT with CASPc of these cases led to 67% (12 of 18) complete response, 22% (4 of 18) partial response, and 11% (2 of 18) no response (less than 50% reduction in tumor size). Four cases could not be evaluated. Since the overall tumor response to CASPc is very good, and the problem of skin photosensitivity is nonexistent, it is expected that using CASPc-PDT to eradicate human tumors would also yield comparable results. Further studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to optimize the use of CASPc-PDT in veterinary and human medicine.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that among the various cell-surface proteins capable of interacting with laminin, the 67-kd high-affinity laminin receptor plays a crucial role during tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, the expression of laminin-receptor-precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and 67-kd protein was analyzed in human colon adenocarcinoma. In 22 of 23 patients with colon cancer, we found a 2- to 23-fold increase in levels of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA in the cancer tissues compared with those in matched normal adjacent colonic mucosa. In 10 of 11 cases studied, the level of 67-kd laminin receptor, detected by affinity-purified anti-laminin-receptor synthetic peptide antibodies on immunoblots of matched tumor and normal tissue extracts, was higher in the colon carcinoma tissue. Immunodetection of laminin receptor in tissue sections using anti-laminin-receptor-peptide antibodies confirmed that the increased expression of laminin receptor was specifically associated with the cancer cells. In a series of 72 paraffin sections of colon lesions, we observed a correlation between the expression of the laminin receptor and the Dukes' classification. Our observations indicate that increased expression of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA is associated with enhanced levels of the 67-kd laminin receptor as well as with the invasive phenotype of colon carcinoma. Detection of this metastasis-associated gene product may be a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of human colon cancer.\r"

ImuVert, a cytokine inducer derived from Serratia marcescens, which produces broad-spectrum activation of both macrophages and lymphocytes, was dramatically more effective when it was tested in tumors obtained from patients with previously treated, chemotherapy-responsive adenocarcinomas (breast and ovary) than when it was tested in tumors obtained from either previously untreated patients or previously treated patients with chemotherapy-refractory adenocarcinomas (colon, lung, pancreas, stomach, kidney, gallbladder, uterus, and prostate). Similar findings, relating to prior chemotherapy treatment status, were obtained for tumor necrosis factor and interferon gamma, but not for interleukin-2 or interferon alpha. On the basis of these findings and on other evidence in the literature, we speculate that response to chemotherapy produces massive release and processing of tumor antigens. We further speculate that this response leads to a state in which the human immune system is primed (via in situ vaccination) to respond to exogenous macrophage-activation signals with potent, specific antitumor effects.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the 93-kd tyrosine kinase encoded by the human c-fes proto-oncogene (also known as FES) is restricted to mature hematopoietic cells of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages, suggestive of a function essential to normal myeloid differentiation. However, recent studies have shown that c-fes can transform fibroblasts if sufficient levels of gene expression are achieved. These findings indicate that strict regulation of the c-fes gene is critical to normal myeloid development, whereas elevated c-fes expression may contribute to malignant transformation. In the present study, we compared the c-fes messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in leukemia blasts from patients with myeloid or lymphoid leukemia with those of peripheral monocytes from a normal donor with the use of a quantitative ribonuclease protection assay. The presence of c-fes mRNA was readily detected in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, but c-fes mRNA was present in low levels or was absent in lymphoid leukemia cells. The leukemia cells of two of five AML patients and four of four CML patients expressed more c-fes mRNA than monocytes from a normal donor, with more than a threefold elevation in the cells of one CML patient. No evidence of amplification or rearrangement of the c-fes gene was detectable by Southern blot analysis of myeloid leukemia DNA, suggesting that the variation in c-fes mRNA levels are related to differences in transcriptional activity and/or message stability. These results indicate that elevated c-fes expression is a common feature of myeloid leukemia cells that could potentially contribute to the leukemia phenotype.\r"

Over a 21-month period, 50 patients underwent CXR and CCT according to a standard protocol, and their films and records were reviewed retrospectively. Hemo- and/or pneumothorax (HPTX) was noted in 12 patients (five by CXR, 12 by CCT). Pulmonary contusion (PC) was identified in ten patients (four by CXR, ten by CCT). Three additional false positive PC were diagnosed by CXR. Therapy changes based upon CCT findings occurred in seven of seven HPTX and five of six PC. The two imaging techniques were complementary in detecting fractures. Atelectasis was a common CCT finding (58% incidence). Chest X-ray is less sensitive than chest computed tomography in the detection of HPTX (42% vs. 100%) and PC (40% vs. 100%). Emergent chest computed tomography is recommended in stable patients with: 1) blunt high-energy torso trauma, 2) \"cross-body\" injury pattern, and/or 3) a mechanism of injury suggestive of chest trauma.\r"

Hypothermia to 29.5 degrees C was induced in eight anesthetized dogs, and thermistors placed in the pulmonary artery, liver, bladder, esophagus, rectum, muscle, and skin. Four experimental animals were rewarmed by creating a fistula which connected arterial and venous femoral lines to an interposed counter-current heat exchanger. External rewarming was used in four controls. Bleeding time (BT), coagulation profile (PT, PTT, TT), and cardiac output (CO) were measured during rewarming. Core temperature (T) rose significantly faster with CAVR (0.00001). Average time to rewarming was 45 min, vs. 4 hrs in controls. Haptoglobin, platelet, fibrinogen, and fibrin split product levels were unaffected. Continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR) improved T, CO, BT, and coagulation profile faster than any method yet reported not requiring heparin or cardiac bypass. The application of CAVR in post-traumatic hypothermia warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "During a recent 11-year period, 233 consecutive patients with 358 penetrating iliac vascular injuries were treated at our institution. Injuries of the common and external iliac arteries were most often repaired with lateral suture (31%) although several other techniques were also employed. Lateral suture and ligation were used with nearly equal frequency in the management of venous injuries. The hospital mortality rate for the series was 28%, and 56/66 deaths (85%) were due to exsanguination or shock. One patient, initially treated with an end-to-end anastomosis of the iliac artery, died a year after discharge from a ruptured false aneurysm. Two patients treated with lateral suture of venous injuries died of pulmonary embolism. Arterial complications occurred in 15% of patients with arterial injuries and three patients required amputation. No graft infections occurred in 16 patients treated with PTFE interpositions, including four with associated colorectal injuries. Venous complications occurred in 12% of patients with venous injuries, and most were noted in those treated with ligation. Four patients treated by venous ligation developed chronic venous insufficiency. The prevention of death from exsanguination is the greatest problem in the management of patients with iliac vascular injuries. Although some late deaths and many complications may be related to the technique of vascular repair, circumstances often prohibit alternative methods. Despite two deaths from pulmonary embolism, insufficient data exist to condemn lateral suture of venous injuries.\r"

Thirty-two (56%) had moderate-severe pulmonary contusions and 44 (77%) required chest tubes for hemo-pneumothorax. Ventilatory assistance was used in 36 (63%). The major factors determining the need for ventilatory assistance were: an ISS greater than or equal to 23, blood transfusions in the first 24 hours, moderate-severe associated injuries (fractures, head injuries or truncal organs requiring operation), and shock on admission (p less than 0.001). An adverse outcome occurred in 15 (28%); nine required ventilatory assistance greater than or equal to 14 days and six died of sepsis with pneumonia. The main factors associated with an adverse outcome were: an ISS greater than or equal to 31 (p less than 0.001), moderate-severe associated injuries (p less than 0.001), and blood transfusions (p less than 0.005). Although the primary determinants of an adverse outcome were the associated injuries and blood loss, a bilateral flail (p less than 0.01) and age greater than or equal to 50 years (p less than 0.02) were contributing factors.\r"

  ".U": "91080204\r", 
  ".W": "The experience of eight trauma centers with duodenal injuries was analyzed to identify trends in operative management, sources of duodenal-related morbidity, and causes of mortality. During the 5-year period ending December 1988, 164 duodenal injuries were identified. Patient ages ranged from 5 to 78 years. There were 38 Class I, 70 Class II, 48 Class III, four Class IV, and four Class V injuries. Injury mechanism was penetrating in 102 (62%) patients and blunt in 62. Primary repair of the duodenal injury was performed in 117 (71%) patients, including 27 patients also managed with pyloric exclusion and 12 with tube duodenostomy. Duodenal resection with primary anastomosis was used in six (4%) patients and pancreatoduodenectomy was necessary in five (3%). There were 30 (18%) deaths. The cause of death was uncontrolled hemorrhage from severe hepatic or vascular injuries in 22 (73%) patients. In only two (1%) patients could death be attributed to the duodenal injury; each as the result of duodenal repair dehiscence and subsequent sepsis. Duodenal-related morbidity was documented in 29 (18%) patients, including 22 patients with intra-abdominal abscess, six with duodenal fistula, and five with frank duodenal dehiscence. In summary, this analysis demonstrated: 1) the great majority of duodenal injuries can be managed by simple repair; 2) tube duodenostomy is not a mandatory component of operative treatment; 3) pyloric exclusion is a useful adjunct for more complex injuries; 4) pancreatoduodenectomy is rarely necessary for civilian duodenal trauma; 5) morbidity following duodenal trauma is more dependent on associated intra-abdominal injuries than the extent of duodenal trauma; and 6) mortality following duodenal injuries is primarily related to associated vascular and hepatic trauma.\r"

  ".W": "Data on host factors influencing mortality in trauma patients is sparse and contradictory. To develop a model for health policy decisions, we examined all trauma admissions to acute care hospitals in the state of California in the year 1986. We looked at the influence of the following host factors: age, gender, and preinjury medical conditions, on mortality stratified by injury severity. The study group (N = 199,737) had an overall mortality rate of 1.9%. Mortality increased starting at age 40 years and was independently influenced by gender, the presence of pre-existing disease, and the body region injured. In patients with minor injury, mortality rates became higher in the elderly at age 65+. However, in patients with injuries of moderate severity, mortality increased in both middle age (40-64) and elderly groups (65+). Male gender was also a risk factor, present in both the elderly and middle age groups. While the presence of both pre-existing medical disease or injury to head or abdomen was related to increased mortality in middle-aged patients at all severity levels, neither accounted for the effect of gender. Conclusion. Age and gender influence mortality in trauma patients. These effects are not explained by documented pre-existing disease or region of injury. Age and gender serve only as observable markers for subgroups of patients with impaired response to injury. Middle-aged males comprise a previously unrecognized high-risk subgroup for this impaired response.\r"

During the period 1980 through 1988, 43 patients who survived greater than 48 hours following this injury were managed in our center. The locations of their soft-tissue defects were: extremity, 22; abdomen/chest, 18; and head/neck, three. All patients underwent immediate surgical exploration and wide debridement of all devitalized tissue along with repair of associated injuries. Management included mandatory frequent dressing changes, debridement, irrigation in the operating room, and the perioperative administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Four patients whose abdominal wall defects could not be initially closed had temporary placement of rayon cloth to prevent evisceration. Overall, four patients underwent delayed primary closure, eight were covered with split-thickness skin grafts, nine had closure with myocutaneous flaps, and 19 closed by secondary intent. Two patients, who were transferred to us following initial management, developed wound sepsis due to inadequate debridement and both eventually required amputation as did one patient who developed early myonecrosis following lengthy arterial repair. Frequent operative dressing changes, adequate debridement, and irrigation minimize sepsis following close-range shotgun blasts and should be the treatment of choice for this devastating injury. Techniques of wound closure need to be individualized to the particular situation.\r"

Patients with cervical spine fractures or dislocations and those with fixed deformity were excluded. The clinical significance of asymmetry was determined utilizing dynamic axial CT scanning of the occiput (C0), atlas (C1) and axis (C2) with the head neutral and with 15 degrees to 30 degrees active rotation. Nineteen patients demonstrated greater than 5 degrees of relative motion of C1 on C2 bilaterally. Three patients had less than 5 degrees of relative motion bilaterally and three patients had less than 5 degrees relative motion with left rotation only. No patient had formal treatment and all had nearly normal cervical range of motion on clinical examination at the time of hospital discharge. The finding of an asymmetric odontoid-lateral mass interspace on properly centered open-mouth AP X-rays in the presence of otherwise normal cervical spine X-rays, in conscious patients without fixed deformity, appears to be incidental and requires no further evaluation or treatment.\r"

  ".W": "During a 10-year period, 87 patients who had undergone elective colostomy closure at Bellevue Hospital were retrospectively reviewed in order to evaluate the morbidity of colostomy closure after traumatic injury and its financial impact. Sixty-two per cent of the colostomies were in the left colon and 38% were right sided. The interval from the original injury to colostomy takedown varied from 20 to 465 days, with a mean of 144 days. The mean postoperative hospital stay for the entire group was 15.13 days at a cost of $13,995. There were no deaths and no anastomotic leaks in the entire series, but a morbidity rate of 25% ensued. Small bowel obstruction was the most frequent significant complication, occurring in ten patients (11.5%) and resulting in a prolongation of hospital stay by 7 days at an additional cost of $6,500 per patient. One additional patient developed a subphrenic abscess which required operative drainage, necessitating an additional 24 days in the hospital at an increased cost of $22,200. Other complications which did not prolong hospital stay included eight superficial wound infections, one transient respiratory failure, and two patients who returned at a later date with incisional hernias at the stoma site. The 25% morbidity encountered in this series suggests that colostomy closure is not a low-morbidity procedure and should be considered as an important factor favoring primary repair. Coupled with the significant financial impact of both colostomy formation and takedown, ample justification exists for greater efforts in avoiding colostomy formation whenever feasible.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of alcohol on trauma patients is controversial, with numerous authors citing no difference in mortality in acutely intoxicated patients. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively investigate the effect of alcohol in adult patients with isolated blunt splenic injury. From 1980 through 1989, 47 adult patients with splenic trauma as the only major injury were admitted to the Trauma Service. There were 37 males and ten females with a mean age of 29 years (range, 15 to 61). Motor vehicle accidents were responsible for 44 (94%) of the injuries. Group 1 consisted of 24 patients with a mean blood alcohol level of 185 mg/dl (range, 15 to 380). In Group 2 there were 23 patients without detectable blood alcohol. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in age, Abbreviated Injury Severity Score, initial hematocrit, and grade of splenic injury. Hypotension was present in 13 patients (55%) in Group 1 versus six patients (26%) in Group 2 (p less than 0.05). Significant abnormalities in clotting studies were present on admission in six patients (25%) in the alcohol-detected group versus one in the other group (p less than 0.05). Blood transfusion requirements in the first 24 hours were significantly greater in Group 1 (mean, 3.9 units) versus Group 2 (mean, 0.5 units) (p less than 0.001). If alcohol was present, there was much less chance for splenic conservation, as 18 patients (75%) underwent splenectomy versus seven patients (30%) in the nonalcohol group (p less than 0.05). There was one death and this occurred in a patient acutely intoxicated who suffered a cerebral infarct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients were seriously traumatized. Before developing candidosis, all patients had documented bacterial infections. These infections were generally polymicrobial and were treated with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics (an average of 5.4 antibiotics for 17.2 days). Twenty-eight (85%) of 33 patients received enteral feedings for an average of 11 days +/- 1.5 (SEM) before developing candidosis and 24 (73%) received NG/oral nystatin for an average of 7.6 days +/- 0.9 before developing candidosis. All patients with candidosis were treated with intravenous amphotericin B: cumulative dose of 157.3 mg +/- 31.3 mg given over 10 days +/- 1.1. One patient developed recurrent candidosis despite NG/oral prophylaxis and enteral feedings. Six patients (18%) died due to sepsis and multiple organ failure. The patients who died did not objectively differ from the survivors. Candidosis is an infrequent infection in severely injured patients. Candidosis was invariably preceded by treatment with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics for a variety of polymicrobial bacterial infections. NG/oral nystatin and enteral feedings did not prevent candidosis, in contrast to widely accepted beliefs. Amphotericin B therapy was safe. Recurrent candidosis was unusual. Candida infections had a high mortality rate associated with multiple blood transfusions and prolonged hospitalization. Candidosis represents a sign of severe injury and illness but can be amenable to prompt, aggressive treatment.\r"

Counties were grouped for comparisons by level of prehospital care (Advanced Life Support [ALS] vs. Basic Life Support [BLS]) and by presence (H) or absence (NH) of a hospital. Death rates were calculated using data from the 1980 population census, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and state vital statistics. Within AP, all 49 counties have ambulance service. Only 9/49 (18%) have ALS service and 13/49 (26%) have no hospital. Age-specific AP rates were higher than NAP and US rates in the 25-44 and 45-64 year age groups. AP death rates were highest for BLS and NH counties across all age groups. Rural UI death rates in the region remain unacceptably high. The reason(s) that AP death rates exceed the NAP rates is uncertain. ALS service and an available hospital were associated with lower death rates. We propose both educational and epidemiologic programs to better identify and define additional problems.\r"

  ".W": "Development of regional medical care systems to treat patients who sustain major accidental injuries (trauma victims) has been based on autopsy studies which demonstrate that hospitals that meet certain accepted criteria of readiness (trauma centers) can prevent needless deaths of trauma victims. However, since only autopsy data have been available from non-trauma centers, it has not previously been possible to compare morbidity data between trauma centers and non-trauma hospitals. This study examines discharge abstract data and a new patient classification system called patient management categories (PMC) which are generated from this abstract data to evaluate length of stay (LOS), complications, and death to compare morbidity and mortality data from trauma centers and non-trauma centers. Discharge abstracts for 1,332 patients with the PMC of femoral shaft fracture with operation were obtained from all hospitals in Western Pennsylvania and Maryland for 1 year. Data from trauma centers were identified and compared to non-trauma centers using the following criteria: time to OR (less than or equal to 2 days vs. greater than 2 days), age (0-12, 13-55, greater than 55 years), associated injuries, and development of complications and death. Patients treated in trauma centers had significantly fewer complications (21% vs. 33%; p less than 0.001) and lower mortality rates (p less than 0.05) than those treated in non-trauma centers. Associated injuries, age, complications, and/or delay in time to OR significantly increased intensity and length of stay in both trauma and non-trauma centers. This significantly increased the cost of care provided to these patients in both types of centers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Central venous oxygen (CVO2) saturation has been shown to be a sensitive and reliable correlate of blood loss in an animal model but its clinical validity is unproven. We evaluated 26 consecutive patients with an injury mechanism suggesting blood loss but who were deemed stable after initial evaluation. Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, pulse pressure, urine output, CVP) and CVO2 saturation were serially measured. Blood loss was estimated by direct intracavitary collection or serial hematocrits and acute transfusion requirements. Despite stable vital signs, ten patients (39%) had CVO2 saturations under 65%. These patients had more serious injuries, significantly larger estimated blood losses, and required more transfusions than those patients with CVO2 saturation greater than 65%. Linear regression analysis demonstrated the superiority of CVO2 saturation to predict blood loss with a p value less than 0.005 relative to any of the normally followed parameters. CVO2 saturation is a reliable and sensitive method for detecting blood loss. It is a useful tool in the evaluation of acutely injured patients.\r"

Cases were analyzed according to the following criteria: age, diagnosis, mechanism of injury, admitting service, pediatric trauma score (PTS), length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the hospital, and outcome. Forty-three patients were transferred to pediatric trauma centers based on local criteria. Of the remaining 1,264 patients kept at the Level II Trauma Centers, the average patient age was 8.34 year; PTS, 9.74; and length of stay, 4.46 days. Two hundred fifty-eight patients (19.7%) required ICU care for an average length of stay of 2.86 days. Twenty-four patients (1.8%) died; all 24 had a PTS less than or equal to 8. In comparing the data to the guidelines in Appendix J of the American College of Surgeons' Hospital and Prehospital Resources for Optimal Trauma Care of the Injured Patient for transfer to a Level I Pediatric Trauma Center, we found that children with a PTS greater than 8 and who either require ICU care and/or have altered states of consciousness can safely be treated in the adult ICU of a Level II Trauma Center.\r"

Many are problem drinkers or alcoholics, smokers, and also abuse other drugs. Both acute ingestion and chronic abuse of alcohol increase the frequency and severity of injury, and may complicate patient management by mimicking head trauma, masking intra-abdominal injury, causing circulatory collapse, reducing immune response, altering hepatic metabolism, or causing delirium tremens. Proper management of a trauma patient with alcohol includes BAC determination, careful history taking for alcoholism with referral for further evaluation or treatment when indicated, and determination whether other drugs are also being misused. Failure to do these may put a physician at legal risk both for improper care of the patient and for exposing others to injury if the patient crashes after being discharged from the emergency department while still impaired by alcohol.\r"

All patients suffered from a severe burn trauma of more than 30% total body surface area. Stimulation of PMN in healthy donors (n = 10) with the Ca-ionophore resulted in the conversion of 3H-lyso-PAF into PAF (18 +/- 2% of total radioactivity) and alkyl-acyl-glycero-phosphorylcholine (alkyl-acyl-GPC, 50 +/- 6%). In burned patients a significantly reduced formation of 3H-PAF was observed between days 1 and 15 post-trauma (day 9: 1 +/- 1%, p less than 0.0001). This pattern was normalized again in patients (n = 5) who survived the trauma after septic periods and was observed during the second week post-trauma. In one patient who succumbed to his injuries a sustained inhibition of PAF formation was observed up to his death. The decreased formation of PAF correlated weakly with the appearance of immature granulocytes within the analyzed cell fraction (ratio of immature cells versus PAF-formation, r = -0.55, p = 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pathophysiology involves the presence of craniodural fistula allowing ingress of air. A ball-valve mechanism may allow air to enter but not exit the cranium, or CSF leak permits air entrance as fluid leaves the intracranial space. While a \"succession splash\" is considered diagnostic of pneumocephalus, most patients have nonspecific signs and symptoms such as headache. Therefore, a high index of suspicion in a patient with recent head trauma is necessary. The diagnosis is made radiographically by CT scan. This is generally performed to rule out intracranial hematoma or cerebral contusion in head trauma, but will reveal even very small quantities of air to the unsuspecting physician. Therapy is often noninvasive, allowing the craniodural defect to heal spontaneously. Selected situations require immediate operative repair of the fistula.\r"

  ".W": "To measure the effectiveness and tolerance of long-term malaria prophylaxis with mefloquine, the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and of adverse reactions was compared in Peace Corps volunteers in West Africa who took mefloquine every 2 weeks and in volunteers who took chloroquine phosphate weekly. Mefloquine was only 63% more effective than chloroquine; the monthly incidence of P falciparum infections was one case per 100 volunteers who took mefloquine and 2.7 cases per 100 volunteers who took chloroquine. Using daily proguanil (chloroguanide) hydrochloride in addition to chloroquine did not provide additional protection. All mefloquine prophylaxis failures occurred during the second week of the every-2-weeks dosing regimen in volunteers who had used mefloquine for more than 2 months. Blood concentrations of mefloquine were lower during the second week of the alternate-week regimen than during the first week, suggesting that blood levels are too low during the second week to suppress parasitemia. No serious adverse reactions were observed. The results indicate that a dosing regimen of 250 mg of mefloquine weekly should be considered for travelers to areas with chloroquine-resistant P falciparum malaria.\r"

In multivariate analyses, contaminants were independently correlated with 20% and 39% increases in total subsequent laboratory charges and intravenous antibiotic charges, respectively.

However, recent pure thiazide users experienced significant protection against fracture (adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.88), whereas recent users of combination drugs containing thiazides experienced no protection (adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 3.05). Combination drugs generally contained only 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, suggesting that the small amount of thiazide was insufficient to preserve bone mass.

After controlling for this difference, the actual in-hospital death rate was 1.2 to 3.2 times higher among uninsured patients in 11 of 16 cohorts. The uninsured also were 29% to 75% less likely to undergo each of five high-cost or high-discretion procedures and 50% less likely to have normal results on tissue pathology reports for biopsies performed during five of seven different endoscopic procedures. Our results suggest that insurance status is associated with a broad spectrum of aspects of hospital care.\r"

This coincides with peaks in diurnal variation of frequency of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death. A number of potential underlying common triggering mechanisms, including catecholamine secretion, sympathetic nervous system activity, blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol secretion, and aggregability of platelets, exhibit similar surges. As a result of these coinciding morning peaks, myocardial oxygen demand is increased and oxygen supply reduced after a person arises in the morning. Attention to this vulnerable period is merited in the timing and choice of medication, both to prevent or reduce ischemia and to modify potential disease-triggering mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The morphological features of the juxtaglomerular part of the afferent arteriole presented here are in favor of a bulk fluid flow through the fenestrated endothelium and the urinary space of the glomerulus towards the renin-granulated epithelioid cells and the extraglomerular mesangium. In addition there should be some fluid movement from the glomerular mesangium draining via the glomerular stalk. These flows can be important codeterminants of the interstitial fluid composition around the granular cells and act themselves as a signal to granular or extraglomerular mesangial cells to trigger renin secretion and/or a short-loop (vasculo-vascular) feedback mechanism in governing the glomerular filtration. These studies also provide evidence that the terminal part of the afferent arteriole, consisting of granular cells, lacks the immunoreactive myosin. The role of this vessel segment not only as a putative effector of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, but also as an intrarenal vascular receptor, should therefore be reconsidered. The electrophysiological data presented herein suggest an intrarenal extravascular conversion of Ang I to Ang II in the vicinity of the granular cell. This de novo locally-formed angiotensin II may directly influence the renin secretion, mesangial cell function, and thus tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism and glomerular hemodynamics.\r"

  ".W": "The time course of the renal blood flow and GFR responses to narrowing of the renal artery in conscious dogs is reviewed. The initial response to this threat to renal perfusion is renal vasodilatation, but within minutes a secondary vasoconstriction mediated by angiotensin II begins to develop. Angiotensin II-mediated contraction of mesangial cells is also demonstrable, but this does not apparently reduce the filtration surface area of the glomerular capillaries. The intrarenal effects of angiotensin II restore GFR back to normal within one to two weeks, by which time circulating plasma angiotensin II levels are no longer elevated. In contrast to its effects on GFR, angiotensin II has minimal effects on renal blood flow after stenosis. This may be because, (i) blood flow is mainly determined by the hydraulic resistance of the stenosis; (ii) renal vasoconstriction has relatively little effect on flow due to the particular hemodynamic properties of the stenoses, and (iii) a major site of action of angiotensin II may be within the glomerulus. Thus angiotensin II has a homeostatic role in the maintenance of GFR during renal artery narrowing and one component of this role may involve mesangial contraction.\r"

In renal transplant recipients treated by azathioprine and steroids, the occurrence of CEI-induced deterioration of renal function is highly suggestive of renal artery stenosis, whereas renal vasodilatation associated with unchanged glomerular filtration rate in response to CEI is indicative of a significant role of native kidneys. In hypertensive recipients without renal artery stenosis, the absence of renal hemodynamic changes after CEI may be predictive of subsequent chronic rejection. The information provided by CEI is rather different in cyclosporine treated subjects. In this setting, no acute effect of CEI on renal hemodynamics is detectable. Whether the renal response to CEI is similar in cyclosporine when compared to conventionally treated patients with renal artery stenosis remains to be demonstrated.\r"

A large body of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that glomerular capillary hypertension is important in the pathogenesis of progressive chronic renal failure of diverse types, including subtotal renal ablation and diabetic nephropathy. Converting enzyme inhibitors are effective in slowing or arresting the progression of glomerular injury in these experimental models, in association with normalization of both systemic and intrarenal pressures. Clinical studies of diabetic nephropathy and chronic renal failure of other etiologies support the concept that these same renal hemodynamic factors are important in human renal disease and that treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors may prove to be a useful therapeutic intervention. Whether the converting enzyme inhibitors have specific advantages over other antihypertensive agents due to beneficial renal hemodynamic effects, as suggested by experimental studies, is a question that awaits further investigation. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of hypertensive glomerular injury is complex and involves the participation of diverse biologic systems. We predict that a wide variety of therapeutic maneuvers, with disparate mechanisms of action, may be effective in arresting or preventing glomerular injury.\r"

The description is based mainly on studies of superficial glomeruli of the rat kidney. The contractile apparatus of mesangial cells consists of microfilament bundles located predominantly within mesangial cell processes. The thickest microfilament bundles occur in the juxtacapillary mesangial cell processes, which directly abut the glomerular capillaries. The effector structure of mesangial cell contractility is the GBM. Mesangial cell processes are connected to the GBM either directly or through the interposition of extracellular microfibrils. In general, the contractile system of the mesangium interconnects opposing parts of the GBM. This arrangement is particularly obvious in the juxtacapillary processes, which underlie a mechanical connection between the GBM at the two opposing mesangial angles of a single capillary. The geometry and structural composition of the contractile apparatus of the mesangium indeed suggest a static rather than a dynamic function. In conjunction with the GBM, the mesangial contractile apparatus seems capable of supporting sufficient wall tension to counteract the distending forces acting across the capillary walls; the apparatus also seems capable of directly balancing the distending forces on the perimesangial walls. Assuming that mesangial cells are capable of isotonic contractions, the effect of such a contraction on capillary diameter and, consequently, on filtration area would be small.\r"

In addition, there is mounting evidence, collected mostly in experiments in vitro, that other enzymes may be able to activate angiotensin I, for example by the stepwise release of the C-terminal His and Leu residues. Angiotensin I, instead of being activated, could be inactivated by the cleavage of its C-terminal tripeptide either by neutral endopeptidase 24.11 or by prolyl endopeptidase. Angiotensin II is cleaved by several peptidases widely distributed in the kidney. One of the products, des-Phe8-angiotensin II, is not entirely inactive as it has an effect in the CNS.\r"

A further aim was to identify AIFAs in human vasculature and to establish whether they are affected in essential hypertension. Sprague-Dawley rats and vascular sections of patients undergoing corrective surgery were studied. Enzyme kinetic assays were performed using angiotensin I radioimmunoassay and purified natural angiotensinogens. Fast protein liquid chromatography was employed for biochemical characterization. A series of AIFAs with various isoelectric points, molecular weights and pH optima was detected in rat extrarenal vascular and, with differing distributions of enzyme activities, in renal tissues. In extrarenal arteries the main form of renal renin was present with a relatively low activity only. AIFAs were also demonstrable in human extrarenal vasculature and behaved like plasma renin in essential hypertension. The results indicate the existence of an intrinsic human vascular RAS in extrarenal (and renal) arteries. Extrarenal arterial AIFAs are not generally stimulated in essential hypertensives, as previously postulated.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence accumulates that intrarenal angiotensin II (Ang II) plays important roles in the regulation of renal functions. To determine the mechanism and site of the intrarenal formation of Ang II, we employed histochemical, cell biological and ex vivo perfusion methods. Immunohistochemical studies have revealed the co-existence of renin and Ang II in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, and electron microscopic studies and subcellular organelle fractionation have demonstrated the localization of renin and angiotensin in renin granules. Cloned and cultured renin-containing cells derived from rat kidney were also found to contain renin, ACE, and Ang I and Ang II. The subcellular fractionation of renin granules from rat kidney homogenate demonstrated the presence of Ang I and Ang II in the renin granule fractions. The findings suggest the formation of both angiotensins in JG cells. To study the release of Ang I and Ang II, we determined the release of these peptides from isolated rat kidney perfused with Krebs-Ringer buffer at a constant pressure. Release of both peptides was stable for as long as two hours in the absence of angiotensinogen in the perfusion medium. There was a positive correlation between renin secretion rate and Ang I secretion rate, and also between Ang I secretion rate and Ang II secretion rate. Since the perfusate does not contain angiotensinogen, these results lead to the hypothesis that Ang II is formed in JG cells in the kidney and is directly secreted with renin into plasma or the interstitial fluid, and that Ang II formed in the kidney cells may participate in various renal functions along with Ang II produced in the plasma.\r"

Blocking the inward rectifyer was paralleled by membrane depolarization, but we obtained no evidence for calcium entry due to voltage-gated calcium channels in JG cells. Instead, under voltage clamp Ang II induced release of calcium from intracellular stores followed by a phase of transmembrane calcium influx and oscillations of intracellular calcium concentrations. Changes in intracellular calcium concentrations were accompanied by prominent calcium-activated chloride currents.\r"

Blood flow under NE and Ang II was reduced in C glomeruli by -42 +/- 4.9% and -37 +/- 4.0%, respectively, but in JM glomeruli was reduced by -10 +/- 6.2% and -8.6 +/- 2.9% of control. Perfusion pressure reduction during NE or Ang II infusion to preinfusion values revealed autoregulatory behavior only in C glomeruli. In a second series of experiments cyclooxygenase inhibition by local administration of indomethacin (2.8 x 10(-5) M) induced C and JM vasoconstriction. The effects of NE and Ang II during local application of indomethacin were variable but different responsiveness of C and JM vessels disappeared. We assume that the differences in NE and Ang II responsiveness between C and JM vessels under control conditions are caused by a high prostaglandin content or sensitivity, particularly of JM vessels in the hydronephrotic kidney.\r"

A functional interaction between Ang II and prostaglandins is likely to occur in preglomerular vessels and deserves further assessment. An additive, functional interaction was demonstrated between Ang II and autoregulation in afferent arterioles. Calcium channel blockers interfere with Ang II-induced constriction only in preglomerular vessels of SJMNs.\r"

During infusion of norepinephrine at an average rate of 107.5 ng/kg min, mean femoral arterial pressure (MAP) increased from 102.1 +/- 3.55 to 113.7 +/- 3.44 mm Hg and PSF-max increased from 7.45 +/- 1.13 to 9.95 +/- 1.19 mm Hg. When MAP was returned to control by a suprarenal aortic clamp PSF-max was 5.64 +/- 1.09 mm Hg (NS vs. control). Similarly, at an infusion rate of 226.5 ng/kg min PSF-max was not significantly different from control (6.79 +/- 1.61 mm Hg). V1/2, the half-maximum flow rate, was not altered by norepinephrine whether MAP increased or was kept constant. Infusion of vasopressin at the pressor dose of 13.0 mU/kg min increased MAP by about 25 mm Hg and raised PSF-max from 6.56 +/- 0.84 to 14.45 +/- 1.54 mm Hg. However, when MAP was returned to normal PSF-max was 5.41 +/- 0.75 mm Hg (NS). Our data show that in contrast to angiotensin II, norepinephrine and vasopressin do not augment TGF responses when a rise in MAP is prevented. Angiotensin II appears to play a specific role in altering the sensitivity of the TGF mechanism.\r"

Intravenous Ang II (500 ng.kg-1.min-1) increased MAP by 35 +/- 3 mm Hg and the excretion of TxB2 (P less than 0.03), whereas a similar pressor infusion of phenylephrine did not increase TxB2 excretion. A TxA2 receptor antagonist (TxRA) SQ-29,548 (8 mg.kg-1.hr-1) or pretreatment with a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor (TSI), UK-38,485 (50 mg.kg-1.day-1 x 3) blunted (P less than 0.005) the pressor response to 12 +/- 2 and 11 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, whereas TxRA did not modify the pressor response to phenylephrine. Infusion of Ang II at a dose of 50 ng.kg-1.min-1 reduced the GFR and increased the filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance. TxRA blunted (P less than 0.01) these effects of Ang II. In conclusion: 1.) Ang II releases TxA2 within the kidney independent of hypertension; 2.) TxA2 can mediate much of the pressor and renal hemodynamic responses to Ang II.\r"

  ".W": "Studies have examined renal function to determine the role of the kidney in the pathogenesis and maintenance phases of hypertension in the Okamoto-Aoki strain of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). As compared to age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), 4- to 6-week old SHR are moderately hypertensive and have a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF), and an increased renal vascular resistance. Cross-breeding studies indicate the reduction in RBF and GFR in young SHR is genetically linked to the hypertension and thus may be of primary pathogenetic importance. The combination of an elevated vascular resistance and reduced RBF and GFR in young SHR implicates increased activity of a vasoconstrictor system(s), decreased activity of a vasodilator system(s), or both. Observations from several laboratories support the notion that endogenous angiotensin II contributes to the renal vasoconstriction in young SHR during the developmental phase of hypertension. Acute and chronic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme reduce arterial pressure, reduce renal vascular resistance and increase renal blood flow in young and adult SHR. Renal vascular tone in SHR is more dependent on angiotensin converting enzyme activity than that in WKY. The ability of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to produce renal vasodilation may be responsible, at least in part, for its antihypertensive effects. Other studies indicate that renal vascular reactivity to angiotensin II is exaggerated in young SHR. The strain differences in renal reactivity to angiotensin II can be abolished by cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin, indicating that endogenous prostanoids counteract some of the constrictor action of angiotensin II, with more pronounced buffering activity in WKY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is now clear that specific angiotensin dependent mechanisms contribute importantly to the pathophysiology of hypertension and altered renal function in models of two-kidney, one clip hypertension in rats. The generation of angiotensin in the local intrarenal environment of the kidney is a new and potentially important mechanism contributing to altered renal function in these models. Application of antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system to rat models of renal vascular hypertension indicate that the effects of angiotensin attenuate renal hemodynamic and excretory behavior, particularly in the nonclipped kidney. Further, angiotensin may attenuate the efficiency of autoregulation of renal hemodynamics in the nonclipped kidney. Evidence that inhibition of angiotensin reverses or improves these altered hemodynamic and excretory functions indicate that angiotensin may contribute importantly to the pathophysiology of hypertension in these models by altering or impairing the ability of the nonclipped or normal kidney to excrete sodium and volume.\r"

Maximum compound muscle action potential amplitudes are obtained with the coil center located in a rectangular area superior and posterior to the ear canal. A comparison of large and small diameter coils showed them to be equally effective for painless facial nerve stimulation; however, the smaller coil allowed for a more localized field of activation.

  ".W": "The monothermal differential caloric test allows determination of vestibular recruitment and decruitment, variables which may help discriminate peripheral from central vestibular lesions. Previous reports indicated a strong association between vestibular recruitment and Meniere's disease. This study examined patients having unilateral Meniere's disease. Nystagmus beat frequency (NBF) and slow-component velocity (SCV) responses were recorded by electronystagmography (ENG). Electronystagmographic findings showing unilateral dysfunction were present in 54% of patients by slow-component velocity and in 31% by nystagmus beat frequency. Unilateral hypofunction was the most frequent lateralizing ENG finding. Absolute vestibular recruitment occurred in less than 10% of patients but relative recruitment was found in nearly 20% of patients. Slow-component velocity had higher sensitivity than nystagmus beat frequency, with excellent clinical concordance. Monothermal caloric testing as described in this study best detects peripheral vestibular disease in Meniere's patients using slow-component velocity to determine unilateral hypofunction and relative vestibular recruitment.\r"

Increasingly, subtle bony anatomic variations and mucosal abnormalities of this region are being detected. Data regarding the \"background\" prevalence of these findings are needed to determine their clinical relevance. A detailed analysis of coronal plane CT scans of the paranasal sinuses obtained in 202 consecutively imaged patients was conducted. Special attention was directed toward identifying bony anatomic variations and mucosal abnormalities. Anatomic variations studied included pneumatization of the middle turbinate, paradoxical curvature of the middle turbinate, Haller's cells, and pneumatization of the uncinate process. Such bony anatomic variations were detected in 131 (64.9%) of 202 patients and were found with a similar frequency in patients scanned for sinus complaints and in those scanned for nonsinus reasons. Mucosal abnormalities were detected in 168 (83.2%) of 202 patients. For those patients scanned during the evaluation of sinus-like complaints, mucosal abnormalities were noted in 153 (92.2%) of 166 cases, and were predominantly detected in the anterior ethmoid region. For patients scanned during nonsinus evaluations, mucosal abnormalities were detected in 15 (41.7%) of 36 cases, without predilection for the anterior ethmoid region. Discussion regarding the prevalence and clinical significance of paranasal sinus bony anatomic variations and mucosal abnormalities is included as a guide to assist the otolaryngologist and/or radiologist in the evaluation of coronal sinus CT scans.\r"

Electrical stimulation of the laryngeal representation of the somatomotor cortex resulted in a contralateral evoked vocalis compound muscle action potential.

Using a multiple regression model, we determined the effect on nerve stimulation values of age, sex, race, diabetes, hypertension, partial or complete clinical paralysis, diagnosis of herpes zoster, year of testing, and eventual facial paralysis recovery profile. We discuss statistical reliability, provide a table of interpretive results, and offer \"tips and traps\" invaluable to the practitioner. A prospective study of 25 patients with residual facial paralysis was evaluated by two separate otolaryngologists to determine intertester reliability.\r"

Although clinical practice and scientific publications recognize their frequent association, relationships have yet to be well defined. This study seeks to add order to disarray by delineating symptoms and signs of a clearly identified group of migraine patients. Fifty patients with well-defined basilar migraine underwent a thorough neurotologic examination, as well as comprehensive auditory and vestibular testing. Patients were selected from 5880 patients seen over a 2-year period and were prospectively entered into the study after detailed questionnaires and testing were completed for each patient. The most common symptoms found were dysequilibrium, phonophobia, and head pressure. The most common signs were positional nystagmus, low-frequency hearing loss, abnormal loudness discomfort level, and an abnormality on caloric examination. Advanced vestibular testing showed abnormal amplitude scaling, abnormal toes-down pertubation, and an abnormal sway (condition 6) on dynamic posturography. There was frequently an asymmetry on computerized rotation. The author concludes that the majority of patients have subtle findings on testing, but a few have severe peripheral injury due to the basilar migraine. Findings are consistent with the theory that basilar migraine is a central nervous system maladaptation syndrome which creates otoneurologic symptoms and, in a small percentage of cases, may injure the peripheral end-organ.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand and treat painful conditions, one needs to identify the cause, discover the source, and develop knowledge of peripheral and central pain transmission; headaches are no exception. The development of appropriate animal models is important. Accordingly, we have reviewed the anatomy, neurochemistry, electrophysiology, and pharmacology of the trigeminovascular system in experimental animals and emphasized whenever possible the relevance of this final common pathway to migraine, cluster, and other headache syndromes in humans. For example, based on recent anatomic dissections, the pericarotid cavernous sinus plexus was suggested as an important focus to investigate cluster headache pathophysiology. This plexus is an anatomic point of convergence for the nerves giving rise to the signs of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and sensory symptoms that develop in cluster patients. As in other nociceptive systems, trigeminovascular axons assume at least two important roles. One concerns the transmission of nociceptive information. Electrophysiologic evidence supports the trigeminal nucleus caudalis as an important site for the convergence of visceral (vessel) and somatic (forehead) inputs to mediate the referral of vascular pain to superficial tissues. A second important role concerns the initiation of local increases in blood flow and enhanced protein permeability (sterile inflammation) via the axonal release of vasoactive neuropeptides. Plasma extravasation develops within the dura mater following trigeminal stimulation. Extravasation can be blocked by the administration of ergot alkaloids or sumatriptan, a new serotonin-like agonist, and a prejunctional (neuronal) mechanism of action for these drugs (such as blockade of release) was suggested based on experimental evidence. Whether vasoconstriction also relates to the therapeutic efficacy remains to be determined. As in other organ systems, real or threatened tissue injury provides an important stimulus for depolarizing sensory fibers. The stimulus may come from external conditions such as reduced blood flow or hypoglycemia. The brain may also possess intrinsic neuronal mechanisms by which nociceptors may be synthesized (e.g., glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, seizures). Molecules of relevance include bradykinin, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and potassium. Experimental evidence was presented demonstrating that the trigeminal nerve mediates hyperemia within cortical gray matter by axon-reflex like mechanisms. An important role for this nerve was established during the hyperemic period of recirculation after ischemia or during severe hypertension above the limits of autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The authors propose that this central neuronal hyperexcitability involves overactivity of the excitatory amino acids, glutamate, and possibly aspartate. Stimuli that activate the migraine attack evoke neuronal depolarization, slow depolarization shifts, and spreading suppression of spontaneous neuronal activity possible by glutamate and K+ dependent mechanisms. A low brain Mg2+ and consequent reduced gating of glutamatergic receptors may provide the link between the physiologic threshold for a migraine attack and the mechanisms of the attack itself by promoting glutamate hyperactivity, neuronal hyperexcitability, and susceptibility to glutamate-dependent spreading depression.\r"

  ".W": "Because a satisfactory animal model for migraine does not exist, attempts to determine a common mechanism of action for effective antimigraine agents may be of benefit in elucidating the pathogenesis of this neurologic syndrome. The present review demonstrates that the clinical data that has developed over the past 30 years may allow for the elucidation of the role of specific 5-HT receptor subtypes in the pathophysiology of migraine. A large number of both acute and prophylactic antimigraine agents share an ability to interact with 5-HT receptor subtypes in human brain. As summarized in Table 3, acute antimigraine drugs (e.g., ergots, sumatriptan) share high affinity for 5-HTID receptors and somewhat lower affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. These receptors are present in certain intracranial blood vessels. 5-HT1D receptors are also located on nerve terminals where they act to inhibit the release of 5-HT and other neurotransmitters. Theoretically, 5-HTID receptor agonists may acutely inhibit the release of vasoactive or pain-inducing substances in the perivascular space. Conceivably, drugs acting at this receptor would stop the progression of this perivascular process. In addition, a number of prophylactic antimigraine drugs display a relatively high affinity for both 5-HT2 and 5-HT1C receptors in human brain. Although these receptors are also found in certain blood vessels, they are present throughout the nervous system. The receptors appear to mediate neuronal depolarizations at the cellular level. Moreover, the 5-HT2 receptor appears to play a key role in the development of inflammation in certain smooth muscle systems. Theoretically, the ability of 5-HT2 antagonists to protect perivascular inflammation may account for their efficacy in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. These data offer a novel approach to the analysis of antimigraine agents. Drugs could be selected for use in clinical migraine studies based on their selectivity for a specific 5-HT receptor subtype. For example, an agent that displays both high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1D receptors could be clinically evaluated. Its effectiveness, or lack thereof, would indicate the importance of this specific 5-HT receptor site in the pathogenesis of migraine. Future attempts to determine a common mechanism of action for effective antimigraine agents should facilitate the elucidation of the pathogenesis of this neurologic syndrome.\r"

Recent studies have elucidated the molecular defect in DMD, including the absence of the protein dystrophin in affected individuals. Normal brain tissue contains dystrophin messenger RNA and dystrophin is present in low abundance in the brain and seems to be regulated in this tissue, at least in part, by a promoter that differs from that in muscle. Until now, antibodies and immunocytochemical methods used to demonstrate dystrophin at the plasma membrane of mouse and human muscle have proven inadequate to localize precisely dystrophin in the mammalian CNS. We have now made an antibody (anti 6-10) which is much more sensitive than those previously available to immunolabel dystrophin in the CNS. Using this antibody, we found that in the mouse, dystrophin is particularly abundant in the neurons of the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, and that it is localized at postsynaptic membrane specializations. Dystrophin may have a different role in neurons than in muscle, and an alteration at the synaptic level may be the basis of the cognitive impairment in DMD.\r"

Embryos homozygous for the recessive lethal mutation spt-1(b104) or 'spadetail' have a complex set of defects in the trunk of the embryo that may arise secondarily after loss of one of these movements, convergence, from those precursors that would normally have given rise to trunk somitic mesoderm. We have now tested this hypothesis by transplanting cells between wild-type and mutant embryos, to identify the cells that spt-1 affects directly. Our results show that the mutation autonomously affects only those mesodermal precursors located along the lateral margin of the early gastrula blastoderm. Other mesodermal cells and all ectodermal precursors seem not to require function of the wild-type gene. Our findings reveal an unexpectedly delicate genetic control of vertebrate gastrulation.\r"

The diverse functions of endothelins are thought to be mediated by interaction with many different receptors coupled to the inositol phosphate/calcium ion messenger pathway. However, because of the structural resemblance of the three peptides, the presence and nature of multiple endothelin receptors remain to be elucidated. We report here the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a bovine endothelin receptor, which has a transmembrane topology similar to that of other G protein-coupled receptors and shows specific binding, with the highest selectivity to ET-1 in animal cells transfected with the cloned cDNA. This receptor messenger RNA is widely distributed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, particularly in the heart and lung. Our results support the view that there are other receptor subtypes.\r"

This is generally ascribed to a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which leads to activation of Ca2(+)-dependent ion channels. A precise understanding of Cl- secretion from these cells has been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the spatial distribution of the Ca2+ signal and of the Ca2(+)-dependent ion channels in the secreting epithelial cells. We have now used the whole-cell patch-clamp method and digital imaging of [Ca2+]i to examine the response of rat pancreatic acinar cells to acetylcholine. We found a polarization of [Ca2+]i elevation and ion channel activation, and suggest that this comprises a novel 'push-pull' mechanism for unidirectional Cl- secretion. This mechanism would represent a role for cytosolic Ca2+ gradients in cellular function. The cytosolic [Ca2+]i gradients and oscillations of many other cells could have similar roles.\r"

  ".W": "The T-cell immune response is directed against antigenic peptide fragments generated in intracellular compartments, the cytosol or the endocytic system. Peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, usually of biosynthetic origin, are presented efficiently to T-cell receptors by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, with which they assemble, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the absence of recognizable N-terminal signal sequences, such cytosolic peptides must be translocated across the ER membrane by a novel mechanism. Genes apparently involved in the normal assembly and transport of class I molecules may themselves be encoded in the MHC. Here we show that one of these, the rat cim gene, maps to a highly polymorphic part of the MHC class II region encoding two novel members of the family of transmembrane transporters related to multidrug resistance. Other members of this family of transporter proteins are known to be capable of transporting proteins and peptides across membranes independently of the classical secretory pathway. Such molecules are credible candidates for peptide pumps that move fragments of antigenic proteins from the cytosol into the ER.\r"

But certain mutations in the MHC can prevent presentation of antigens with class I molecules. In addition, mutations possibly in the MHC can affect presentation by class II molecules. Here we report the finding of a new gene in the MHC that might have a role in antigen presentation and which is related to the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of transporters.

The suppressor gene, p53, is affected in such a manner by numerous mutations, which occur in a variety of human tumours. These mutations usually represent the loss of one allele and the substitution of a single base in the other. We have now analysed the p53 gene in a family affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the occurrence of diverse mesenchymal and epithelial neoplasms at multiple sites. In some instances the neoplasms seem to be related to exposure to carcinogens, including ionizing radiation. The Li-Fraumeni family that we studied had noncancerous skin fibroblasts (NSF) with an unusual radiation-resistant phenotype. DNA derived from the NSF cells of four family members, spanning two generations, had the same point mutation in codon 245 (GGC----GAC) of the p53 gene. This mutation leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glycine in one of the regions identified as a frequent target of point mutations in p53. The NSF cell lines with the mutation also retained the normal p53 allele. This inherited p53 mutation may predispose the members of this family to increased susceptibility to cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The level of expression of exogenous genes carried by transgenic mice typically varies from mouse to mouse and can be quite low. This behaviour is attributed to the influence of the mouse chromatin near the site of transgene integration. This 'position effect' has been seen in transgenic mice carrying the human beta-globin gene. It was however, abolished when DNase I hypersensitive sites (normally found 65 to 44 kilobases (kb) upstream) were linked to the human beta-globin transgene. Thus, the upstream DNA (previously named a dominant control or locus activation region, now denoted a locus control region) conferred the ability to express human beta-globin at high levels dependent on copy number on every mouse carrying the construct. We report here an investigation of chicken beta A-globin gene expression in transgenic mice. A 4.5-kb fragment carrying the beta A-globin gene and its downstream enhancer, without any far upstream elements, is sufficient to ensure that every transgenic mouse expresses chicken globin messenger RNA at levels proportional to the transgene copy number. Thus the chicken DNA elements that allow position-independent expression can function in mice. In marked contrast to the human beta cluster, these elements are no farther than 2 kb from the gene. The location of the elements within the cluster demonstrates that position independence can be mediated by DNA that does not define a gene cluster boundary.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed features of patients who had what appeared initially to be a minor head injury but who developed an acute traumatic intracranial hematoma. Over a 10-year period, 183 patients who were able to open their eyes spontaneously, were oriented to person, place, and time, and who obeyed commands when they were first seen at a hospital subsequently underwent operation for an acute intracranial hematoma. The hematoma was extradural in 54% of these patients. A history of altered consciousness or symptoms of headache and vomiting were present in 61% of the patients; 33% had a focal neurological deficit, and 43% had either focal deficit or signs of a basal skull fracture. A skull fracture was shown radiologically in 60% of patients, including 52% of those not clinically suspected of having an intracranial lesion. Six months after injury, 77% of the patients had made a moderate or good recovery. The possibility that a patient who has recently sustained a head injury might develop an acute intracranial hematoma can never be completely discounted, even when there are no abnormal clinical signs, and a skull x-ray retains a useful place in the investigation of selected patients with a minor head injury.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether early removal of an experimental intracerebral mass altered cerebral blood flow, brain water content, neuropathological findings, or neurological function 24 hours later. In three experimental series, a 50-microliter balloon was inflated within the right caudate nucleus in rats. At 24 hours after inflation, we studied cerebral blood flow by quantitative autoradiography, brain specific gravity, and qualitative histopathology by light microscopy. The animals were also assessed using a simple neurological deficit scale. In each series, half of the animals had the balloon inflated for 10 minutes (Group 1), and half had the balloon inflated permanently (Group 2). After transient inflation, there were surprisingly small differences in the blood flow between the two cerebral hemispheres at 24 hours. By contrast, in animals with permanent inflation, several indices of blood flow were significantly worse in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the balloon: the mean and median blood flow levels in the caudate nucleus; the mean blood flow in the cerebral cortex; and the area of cortex with ischemic levels of blood flow. The specific gravity was reduced in areas surrounding the site of balloon insertion after either transient or permanent inflation, and there was evidence of ischemic cell damage in all animals studied. These changes were more severe after permanent inflation, but the differences were not significant. Neurological outcome was significantly better after transient as compared with permanent inflation. The present findings contradict previous results and suggest that early removal of an intracerebral mass may have subsequent benefits.\r"

In 37 patients with head injuries, the duration of posttraumatic amnesia, as indicated by the number of days COAT scores were in the impaired range, was significantly related to both verbal and nonverbal memory at the baseline and 6 and 12 months after injury. COAT scores were a better predictor of verbal and nonverbal memory performance than the Glasgow Coma Scale score at 6 and 12 months after the injury. This study shows that the COAT has adequate reliability and validity as a measure of the duration of posttraumatic amnesia in children and adolescents.\r"

  ".W": "Variables important in predicting the final postsurgical outcome of 435 patients who sustained missile head wounds during the Iran-Iraq War were evaluated over a 99-month period. The type of projectile, site of injury, and presence or absence of foreign material did not seem to have a significant effect on the final outcome. Of the patients with a perforating type of injury, 48.8% had a poor surgical outcome as compared with 19.9% with a penetrating type and 15.6% with a tangential type. This difference is statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.7 and 17.1, respectively; p less than 0.001). The most important factor in predicting overall outcome was the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the time of admission. Mortality and morbidity contributing to a poor surgical outcome were noted in only 6% of patients with a GCS score at admission of 13 to 15, in 24.6% of those with a GCS score of 9 to 12, in 57% of those with a GCS score of 6 to 8, and in 65% of those with a GCS score of 3 to 5. Of the 71 patients who died, 75% had a score of 3 to 8. Perforating projectiles or those traversing two or more dural compartments were statistically significant in contributing to mortality and morbidity (chi 2 = 17.2; p less than 0.001). The incidence of focal neurological deficit was 100, 90.6, 88, and 52.2% in patients with GCS scores of 3 to 5, 6 to 8, 9 to 12, and 13 to 15, respectively. The two best predictors of mortality in this group of patients were a low GCS score and infection.\r"

  ".W": "Previous retrospective studies of cranial gunshot wounds have failed to determine whether aggressive field resuscitation, triage to a neurosurgical center, and early surgical intervention can improve the assumed poor outcome of these severely injured patients. Therefore, we studied 100 consecutive patients prospectively to establish a systematic approach to treatment. If the patient retained two or more neurological signs after aggressive field resuscitation/intubation, a computed tomographic scan was performed. Rapid surgical debridement was done unless the patient deteriorated to clinical brain death. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score after resuscitation was 3 to 5 in 58 patients, 6 to 8 in 8 patients, 9 to 12 in 12 patients, and 13 to 15 in 22 patients. Seventy-six computed tomographic scans and 43 craniotomies were performed. The Glasgow Outcome Scale scores showed that 60 patients died, 2 were vegetative, 6 were severely disabled, 20 were moderately disabled, and 13 had good outcomes. There were 10 postoperative deaths. No patient with a GCS score of 3 to 5 had a satisfactory outcome; however, outcome progressively improved as the GCS score increased. We conclude that all cranial gunshot patients should initially receive aggressive resuscitation. Patients with stable vital signs should be examined by computed tomographic scan. If the patient's GCS score after resuscitation is 3 to 5 and no operable hematomas are present, then no further therapy should be offered. All patients with a GCS score greater than 5 should receive aggressive surgical therapy.\r"

SSEP grading was based on the presence or absence of the cortical evoked potential, the amplitude of the early cortically generated P22 wave form, and the conduction time through the brain (P/N13-N20 interpeak latency). SSEP responses from both sides of the brain were combined and graded from 1 to 6. The GCS was graded without the verbal component (maximum score, 10), because all patients were intubated. All patients were unresponsive to commands. Median SSEP grades correlated better with Glasgow Outcome Scale and Barthel Index scores (R = 0.57 and 0.64, respectively; P less than 0.00001) than GCS scores did (R = 0.35 and 0.37, respectively, P less than 0.00001), and combining SSEP grades and GCS scores did not improve the predictive power of the model (R = 0.57 and 0.64, respectively; P less than 0.00001). All SSEP Grade 1 patients (n = 13) either died or remained in a vegetative state. In contrast, all SSEP Grade 6 patients (n = 7) had a moderate disability or good recovery. This study demonstrates the prognostic value of early quantitative median nerve SSEP grading for patients with head injuries who are unresponsive to commands within 1 week after the injury.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one surgical decompressions without nerve transposition for ulnar neuropathy were performed in 46 patients. All of the patients were men with an average age of 59 years at the time of surgery. The follow-up range was between 5 and 32 months (average, 17.8 months). The disease involved the nondominant arm in 24 patients (52%) and was bilateral in 5 (11%). In 23 cases (50%), no predisposing condition could be identified, whereas 15 patients (33%) abused alcohol and 8 patients (17%) had diabetes mellitus. Fifty-seven percent of the patients helped by surgery had symptoms for less than 1 year, whereas only 30% of patients with symptoms for more than 1 year had symptomatic improvement. The relative magnitude of the slowing of ulnar nerve conduction velocity across the elbow was not significantly correlated with the success of decompression in relieving symptoms. Ulnar nerve conduction velocities across the elbow were 36.13 +/- 11.76 m/s in those responding to surgery and 38.97 +/- 13.91 m/s in those not responding (c = 0.06, dF = 50, P less than 0.3). A total of 37 patients showed symptomatic improvement after decompression. Simple decompression of the ulnar nerve was performed under local anesthesia without transposition of the nerve. In all of these cases, compression of the nerve occurred predominantly in the epicondylar groove. Narrowing of the nerve in the groove was present in 28 cases (55%); scar tissue was found adhering to the nerve in 21 cases (41%); and two pseudoneuromas were found (4%). Forty-one operations (80%) resulted in symptomatic improvement, typically noted by the patient within the first month postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Repeated angiography demonstrated saccular cerebral aneurysms in three of five monkeys; two aneurysms were found 15 months and a third 12 months after the operation. At autopsy, one saccular aneurysm was found to be bilocular in shape, and the others were unilocular. Fusiform aneurysms were also observed in four monkeys. Microscopic studies revealed the walls of the saccular aneurysms were very thin and consisted of fibrous tissue. In one aneurysm, the aneurysmal sac was almost obstructed by a well-organized thrombus. No evidence of intramural hemorrhage was found in any of the saccular cerebral aneurysms. The conversion of early aneurysmal changes into saccular aneurysms was found to occur abruptly, and no consistent growth rate was noted. The multiloculation of saccular aneurysms was closely related to the size of an aneurysm. The present study indicates that a saccular cerebral aneurysm may grow abruptly from one of several different kinds of early aneurysmal changes.\r"

The newly developed procedure of a saphenous vein graft bypass of the cavernous carotid artery allows re-establishment of carotid circulation. Patients with poor collateral circulation are at high risk for ischemic complications induced by the prolonged temporary occlusion required to perform the bypass graft. Optimal management of these patients is to perform the venous bypass graft for permanent vascularization while maintaining carotid cerebral circulation through an intraoperative shunt. We studied this procedure in cadavers, and three shunt types were evaluated: the external intrapetrous-supraclinoid shunt (Type A), the internal intrapetrous-supraclinoid shunt (Type B), and the neck internal carotid-supraclinoid shunt (Type C). Anatomical landmarks, techniques, distances, caliber, and materials used are presented. The rationale and candidates for such a procedure are discussed. The specifications of an optimal balloon shunt are presented, and the three procedures are compared.\r"

In the present study, a protocol for prophylactic hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution (\"triple-H\" therapy) was utilized in the treatment of SAH, and the response of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated. Serial CBF measurements, f1 and CBF15, were performed using the xenon-133 inhalation technique to maximize therapy. Surgery within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage was preferred. In 43 patients with SAH, mean hemoglobin and hematocrit were lowered 3.0 +/- 0.3 g/dL and 8.9 +/- 0.5%, respectively, over the first 24 hours. Mean f1 and mean CBF15 over the same period increased 34.2 +/- 5.8% and 21.2 +/- 3.6%, respectively. The maximum mean increase in CBF was 47.2 +/- 4.7% for f1 and 30.1 +/- 3.2% for CBF15. Cerebral blood flow remained elevated during the 21 days after SAH, irrespective of neurological grade on admission, age, sex, or angiographic arterial narrowing. This is the first report of a consistent method for establishing sustained improvement in CBF after SAH. All patients managed in total compliance with the protocol remained neurologically stable or improved. Two patients developed delayed ischemia and infarction because of the inability to sustain protocol requirements. Thirty-six of the 43 patients (84%) were discharged capable of an independent lifestyle. Triple-H therapy is a safe and effective modality for elevating and sustaining CBF after SAH. In combination with early aneurysm surgery, it can minimize delayed cerebral ischemia and lead to an improved overall outcome.\r"

Thirteen patients (28.9%) experienced the acute symptoms of pituitary apoplexy, whereas another 32 had an \"asymptomatic\" hemorrhage, that is, the clinical course was comparable to an uncomplicated adenoma. Nineteen tumors (42.2%) showed marked suprasellar extension, 8 (17.8%) showed moderate extension, and 11 (24.5%) showed slight extension; another 2 (4.4%) were laterosellar and 5 (11.1%) were intrasellar. Invasive behavior was present in 32 cases (71.1%) and this may suggest another hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of tumoral hemorrhage. The incidence of hemorrhagic complications in invasive adenomas with marked suprasellar extension was particularly impressive; therefore, we do not suggest preoperative bromocriptine treatment in this type of tumor. Two of 14 patients operated on by the transcranial route died after surgery, whereas there was no operative mortality in the 31 patients operated on by the transsphenoidal route. It proved advantageous to operate as early as possible, even during the acute phase of pituitary apoplexy. The transsphenoidal approach gave the best results, but to achieve satisfactory late results multidisciplinary treatment was necessary, namely, postoperative radiotherapy in 23 patients, bromocriptine in 12, and endocrine replacement therapy in almost all. In an average follow-up period of 6.2 years, 5 (11.1%) symptomatic recurrences were observed.\r"

Of the remaining 151 patients with benign tumors (89%), only 12 (8%) developed symptomatic hydrocephalus. In an effort to understand the relationship between hydrocephalus and intramedullary spinal cord tumor, the authors analyze the level and histology of the neoplasm, as well as its association with spinal cysts. A review of the neurosurgical literature reveals that 34 similar cases of hydrocephalus associated with intramedullary spinal cord tumors have been reported to date. The authors note that the presence of hydrocephalus in patients with malignant intramedullary astrocytomas is associated with a shorter rate of survival than in those patients with high-grade lesions but without hydrocephalus, apparently due to rapid tumor progression. The ventriculomegaly seen with benign spinal cord gliomas has no statistically significant effect upon long-term prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The extent of surgical resection of spinal tumors is frequently limited by blood loss and technical difficulty associated with the vascularity of the tumors. We report here the use of superselective percutaneous arterial embolization to reduce the rate of blood loss at the time of surgical resection and enhance resectability. The types of tumors treated were metastatic renal carcinoma, metastatic thyroid carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, and giant cell tumor of the sacrum. Two of the patients required repeated embolization and surgery for recurrent symptoms. The estimated blood loss in seven of nine procedures performed on the six patients ranged from 300 to 800 ml, after which no transfusion was required. In two procedures, extensive resection of very large tumors resulted in larger losses of blood, and postoperative transfusion was necessary. No significant complications of embolization or surgery occurred. A key factor in our embolization technique is the use of microfibrillar collagen, which allows occlusion of tumor vessels as small as 20 microns and may prevent reconstitution of the embolized vessels by collateral flow. We conclude that preoperative arterial embolization enhances the resectability of a variety of spinal tumors by reducing intraoperative blood loss. This may provide an additional benefit by reducing the risk related to postoperative transfusion. By permitting a more aggressive surgical approach, the use of preoperative embolization also has the potential to improve outcome in patients with spinal tumors.\r"

  ".U": "91080972\r", 
  ".W": "Slit ventricle syndrome is characterized by chronic or recurring headaches associated with subnormal ventricular volume in patients who have undergone shunt treatment for hydrocephalus. There appear to be at least three pathophysiological mechanisms that cause this syndrome: 1) intermittent shunt malfunction; 2) intracranial hypotension; and 3) paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure in the presence of normal shunt function. To treat seven patients with slit ventricle syndrome caused by paroxysms of elevated intracranial pressure, we successfully used antimigraine therapy rather than standard calvarial expansion procedures. None of these patients has required shunt revision or calvarial expansion during a mean follow-up period of 2 years. The symptoms of slit ventricle syndrome may be a form of \"acquired\" migraine in shunt patients. We suggest that, in clinically stable patients with normal shunt function, treatment against migraine may stabilize symptoms resulting from paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure. Such treatment may prevent unnecessary shunt revisions and/or calvarial expansion procedures.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 41 meningiomas involving the clivus operated on from July 1983 to January 1990 is reported. The presenting symptoms and signs of these patients were similar to those reported previously. All the patients were evaluated by pre- and postoperative thin-section, high-resolution computed tomography using soft tissue and bone algorithms. Most of the patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The regions of the clivus involved by tumor were divided into upper, middle, or lower regions on the basis of anatomical landmarks. The diameter of the tumor was measured in three axes, and a tumor volume and a tumor equivalent diameter were computed to categorize tumors as small, medium, large, or giant types. There were 9 medium, 27 large, and 5 giant tumors in this series. Some simple and some complex operative approaches were employed to effect tumor removal. Large and giant tumors often required more than one operative approach to remove the tumor. Intraoperative technical difficulties included tumor consistency, vascularity, dissection from the brain stem, and vascular and cranial nerve encasement. Postoperative computed tomographic scans documented total excision in 32 patients (78%). Residual tumor remained in the clival or cavernous sinus areas. These patients were either being observed, or were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. There was one operative death due to pneumonia (2%), and three patients (7%) suffered permanent major neurological changes, presumably due to vascular occlusions in the posterior circulation. In the follow-up period, which ranged from 3 to 76 months, 2 patients (6%) with tumors that had appeared to be totally excised experienced recurrence. These patients were treated by a second operation, alone or in combination with radiation therapy. Two patients who had subtotal excisions (25%) had evidence of regrowth. In 2 patients, tumor growth continued despite gamma knife radiosurgery or external beam radiotherapy.\r"

Accordingly, we have been encouraged to pursue a more aggressive approach to intrinsic lesions of the brain stem that appear well circumscribed on magnetic resonance imaging scan. The object of this paper is to report the successful treatment of four intrinsic lesions of the brain stem and to present an overview of the relevant published experience.\r"

In a project organized to assist the neurosurgeon in this time-consuming task, a computer program that can rapidly determine the site of a lesion in a brachial, lumbar, or sacral plexus injury was created. Using known anatomical pathways (37 clinically relevant upper and 20 lower extremity muscle innervations), and relying solely upon the neurological motor examination, rapid computer-assisted diagnosis is possible. When more than one final common pathway lesion occurs (for example, multiple root avulsions of the brachial plexus), possible lesion sites can be obtained. An interactive dialogue between the user and the program helps to determine the location of the lesion. The program can be run on any IBM-compatible personal computer and is presented as an instrument that provides assistance in cases of complex peripheral nerve injuries, when expert consultants are unavailable. In addition, it can be used as an aid to learning and as a review of basic neuroanatomy.\r"

  ".U": "91081134\r", 
  ".W": "Ear injuries occur in people of all ages but predominate in active people such as wrestlers, boxers, and bike riders. The types and extent of injury are a function of the force causing the injury. Shearing forces of moderate intensity cause hematoma formation, whereas greater force causes lacerations or even amputation. Sharp objects cause lacerations determined by the force, direction, and point of impact. The high ratio of surface area to mass makes the auricle vulnerable to extremes of temperature. People participating in high-risk activities should wear protective headgear. The goal of treatment is to restore the normal contours while preventing infection. Hematoma results in disfigurement by organization or chondritis. Evacuation and pressure dressings using sterile technique correct the condition. Second-degree burns are treated by regular cleansing and application of topical antimicrobials. Deeper burns require debridement, biologic dressings, or burying the cartilage subcutaneously for later reconstruction. Simple lacerations are closed under aseptic technique using either skin-to-skin sutures only or sutures of the skin combined with intercartilage sutures. Extensive and complex lacerations require meticulous care to match all fragments and prevent infection or loss of tissue. Bare cartilage must be covered with vascularized tissue. The treatment of total amputation is controversial. Some advocate reattachment as a composite graft using intravenous low molecular weight dextrans and heparin as adjuvants. Mladick dermabrades the amputated pinna, reattaches it with sutures, and then slips it into a pocket of elevated postauricular skin for 2 weeks. Others urge microvascular reanastomosis of the small nutrient vessels. Brent and Byrd separate the cartilage from its overlying skin and envelope it first with vascularized temporoparietal fascia and then a split-thickness skin graft. Chondritis is the most feared complication of injury or surgery of the pinna. It is an aggressive process, and prompt removal of pus and necrotic cartilage is required. Exteriorization and removal of all cartilage is effective but disfiguring. Removal of only affected cartilage and constant irrigation with antibiotic solutions is effective but requires prolonged hospitalization. Iontophoresis of antibiotics into the auricle may be effective and conserve tissue. Traumatic deformities are corrected with composite grafts from the opposite ear, costal cartilage, and local pedicled flaps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91081143\r", 
  ".W": "Soft-tissue defects of the head and neck that are too extensive to be reconstructed with local flaps without excessive impairment of either form or function usually require repair by some type of regional flap. Selection of a specific regional flap depends on the type of defect, i.e., its size and location, and on the intrinsic properties of the regional flap. Single pedicle peninsular or island axial pattern flaps are usually selected because of their improved blood supply compared with random flaps. For most skin defects of the face and neck requiring reconstruction with a regional flap, a medially based deltopectoral flap is usually preferable to musculocutaneous flaps because it is less bulky and produces less donor-site functional impairments. Likewise, for large defects of the upper or lower lip, a deltopectoral flap in most instances is the regional flap of choice for reconstruction. Nasal defects that require regional flaps for repair are reconstructed with various types of forehead flaps. The median flap remains the most useful because the donor site can be closed primarily, leaving a thin midline scar that is camouflaged relatively easily. For nasal defects that require a longer flap that can be provided by a median flap, the oblique forehead flap provides additional length sufficient to reach the base of the columella. Larger defects of the oral cavity and oral pharynx usually require regional or microsurgical flaps for reconstruction of soft-tissue deficits. In addition, mandibular reconstruction may be necessary. The pectoralis major musculocutaneous flap is the author's preferred choice of a regional flap for reconstruction of such defects. The flap readily reaches the oral cavity and oral pharynx and the muscle provides good coverage of the carotid artery when neck dissection has been accomplished. A great advantage of the flap is the ability to achieve reconstruction in one stage without the need for a controlled salivary fistula. Although the deltopectoral flap is the author's preferred regional flap for reconstruction of major defects of the hypopharynx, the pectoralis major musculocutaneous flap is the regional flap of choice when patients are severely malnourished or cachetic. Both flaps provide a source of nonirradiated skin and provide sufficient tissue for total reconstruction of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus. Both methods of reconstruction, however, have a relatively high rate of stenosis of the distal anastomoses.\r"

These goals can generally be achieved with the correct closure of small eyelid defects.

Short-term studies have demonstrated an improvement in the growth rates of subjects with isolated short stature, Turner syndrome, and chronic renal failure; and additional studies are under way to assess the efficacy of GH therapy of other short stature syndromes. However, the long-term efficacy and possible adverse effects of GH treatment in these situations is not known. Until there has been more experience, GH deficiency should remain the primary indication for GH treatment. Growth hormone should not be considered routine therapy for other conditions associated with or resulting in short stature. However, research should continue in these areas to define which children may benefit from GH treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The onset of pubertal development before the age of 8 years in girls or 9 years in boys constitutes precocious puberty. There are numerous causes of precocious puberty, which can be classified as central or peripheral precocious puberty. Central precocious puberty results from premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and thus presents with physical and hormonal findings similar to those found in normal puberty. Peripheral precocious puberty results from extrapituitary gonadotropin secretion or secretion of sex steroids independent of pituitary gonadotropins. All types of precocious puberty are characterized by rapid growth and advancement of skeletal age, leading to the paradox of the tall child becoming a short adult as a result of premature epiphyseal fusion. Long-acting GnRH agonists afford effective, selective, and reversible therapy of central precocious puberty without significant toxicity. GnRH agonists are not effective in managing the premature sexual maturation associated with peripheral precocious puberty, but a number of other agents have been used with some success. These agents include testolactone, ketoconazole, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. GnRH agonist treatment leads to an increase in predicted final height. To determine the true benefit of any of these agents in increasing ultimate height, there is a need for continuing studies in treated cohorts to follow growth patterns until adult stature is achieved.\r"

Improved assays of ACTH and the availability of CRF have provided new insight into the physiology and pathophysiology of the HPA axis and new tools for diagnosis of CS, especially in combination with selective catheterization and sampling. New imaging technology has improved our visualization of pituitary adenomas and has provided powerful methods for identifying tumors ectopically secreting ACTH and primary adrenal tumors. Finally, the refinement of transsphenoidal surgery and its success in treating CD have provided a safe and effective therapy for this disease. For those occasional patients who require medical therapy, drugs are available that decrease steroid biosynthesis. We now have a much better understanding of a fascinating disease process and are able to diagnose and treat it more correctly. One is impatient to see which new pieces of this puzzle will fall into place over the next ten years.\r"

  ".W": "Androgens arise from either adrenal or ovarian secretion or by peripheral conversion of secreted precursors. The adrenals and ovaries normally contribute about equally to testosterone and AD production. DHAS is the major adrenal 17-KS. Testosterone is the major circulating form of androgen. More than 96% of plasma testosterone is bound to SHBG; the free testosterone seems to be the bioavailable fraction. Hyperandrogenism must be considered in any girl with premature or excessive development of public hair or acne, menstrual irregularity (whether it be oligo-amenorrhea or dysfunctional uterine bleeding), or obesity. The most common cause of premature public hair development (pubarche) is premature adrenarche. The most common cause of hyperandrogenism presenting in a teenage girl is polycystic ovary syndrome. However, the differential diagnosis includes \"exaggerated adrenarche,\" late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, virilizing tumors, Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, and abnormalities of androgen action or of metabolism. The plasma free testosterone is a more sensitive indicator of hyperandrogenism than is the total testosterone concentration. The pattern of response of plasma free testosterone, DHAS, and cortisol to dex-suppression testing is diagnostic of the source of androgen excess. Most hyperandrogenic adolescents will be found to have PCOS. The treatment is chosen according to particular symptoms, such as menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, or obesity.\r"

Presentation varies with the severity of the defect, the developmental age achieved before onset, and the presence of associated other abnormalities. Most commonly, primary and secondary testicular insufficiency present at the time of puberty, but the presentation may be at birth or in the early neonatal period. Appropriate investigations may uncover the diagnosis at the time and allow intervention later at the appropriate age. Secondary testicular failure, although more difficult to diagnose and to differentiate from simple delay of development, offers the possibility of later development of spermatogenesis and the attainment of fertility through the use of gonadotropins or GnRH replacement programs. In primary testicular failure, because it implies an intrinsic abnormality of the functioning elements of the testis, spermatogenesis is not inducable by hormonal stimulation. Treatment of testicular failure in the neonatal period is unnecessary unless micropenis is associated. In the pubertal boy, testosterone replacement is the treatment of choice and should be initiated carefully, taking into consideration the age of the subject, his bone age, and the psychosocial circumstances. The goal of therapy is to achieve a normal progression of physical changes of puberty to physical maturity and the normal potential for sexual function.\r"
