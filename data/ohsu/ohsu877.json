  ".W": "We have reviewed some of the data that link the reactive oxygen species produced by inflammatory phagocytes to cancer development. While it is clear that these substances induce phenotypic changes characteristic of those produced by known carcinogens, the precise mechanisms by which these effects are produced require much further study. In vitro, it would appear that phagocyte-generated oxidants could be complete carcinogens, ie, could cause both tumor initiation and promotion. In vivo, however, these substances appear usually to function as tumor promoters or cocarcinogens perhaps because of high levels of endogenous antioxidant defenses. This suggests that there may be even more reason to be optimistic about the potential for positive results in cancer chemoprevention trials in humans, and provides further rationale for the continuing interest in the use of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs in current and future trials. For example, the Chemoprevention Branch of the National Cancer Institute is currently sponsoring seven extramural human efficacy intervention trials testing whether the antioxidant beta carotene can prevent cancer.\r"

  ".W": "High-dose melphalan has induced remissions in about 40% of patients with refractory myeloma, but the mortality has been high, at about 20%, due to complications of prolonged granulocytopenia. In an attempt to stimulate earlier granulocyte recovery, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was administered subcutaneously to 23 patients with refractory myeloma who had been treated with melphalan at a high dose of 100 mg/m2. Thirty-nine percent of patients achieved marked tumor cytoreduction by at least 75%, 2 died within 2 months from infectious complications during severe neutropenia; and median durations of relapse-free and overall survival were 7 and 10+ months, respectively. The nine patients presenting with both advanced age over 50 years and a long history of prior therapy of over 1 year required significantly longer median times of 31 days for granulocytes and of 63 days for platelets to reach safe levels of at least 500/microL and 50,000/microL, respectively, than the 14 remaining patients who had none or only one of these adverse features (21 and 26 days, respectively). In a historic control of 43 patients treated previously with high-dose melphalan but without GM-CSF, hematologic recovery to the aforementioned levels of granulocytes and platelets proceeded over almost 5 weeks, regardless of age and prior treatment exposure. Thus GM-CSF seems to hasten marrow recovery, especially in patients with adequate normal marrow stem-cell reserve as defined by younger age or less prior therapy. While not shortening the duration of neutropenia, GM-CSF dose increments (from 0.25 to 0.5 to 0.75 mg/m2) increased the incidence of severe toxicity from 0% to almost 40%, especially among older patients. These results support the usefulness of low-dose GM-CSF (0.25 mg/m2) in stimulating marrow recovery in selected patients with adequate marrow reserve treated with high-dose melphalan for refractory multiple myeloma.\r"

  ".U": "90345024\r", 
  ".W": "Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) exert multiple effects on the proliferation, differentiation, and function of myeloid lineage cells through their interaction with specific cell-surface receptors. There is a considerable degree of overlap in the biological effects of these two growth factors, but little is known about the mechanisms of postreceptor signal transduction. We have investigated the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 on protein tyrosine-kinase activity in a human cell line, MO7E, which proliferates in response to either factor. Tyrosine-kinase activity was detected using immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for phosphotyrosine. GM-CSF and IL-3 were found to induce a nearly identical pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation using both one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Tyrosine phosphorylation of two cytosolic proteins in particular was increased more than 10-fold, a 93-Kd protein (pp93) and a 70-Kd protein (pp70). Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp93 and pp70 was observed within 1 minute, reached a maximum at 5 to 15 minutes, and gradually decreased thereafter. Other proteins of 150, 125, 63, 55, 42, and 36 Kd were also phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to both GM-CSF and IL-3, although to a lesser degree. Tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on the concentration of GM-CSF over the range of 0.1 to 10 ng/mL and on IL-3 over the range of 1 to 30 ng/mL. Stimulation of MO7E cells with 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or cytokines such as G-CSF, M-CSF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of pp93 or pp70, suggesting that these two phosphoproteins are specific for GM-CSF-or IL-3-induced activation. The extent and duration of phosphorylation of all the substrates were increased by pretreatment of cells with vanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Importantly, culture of MO7E cells with vanadate (up to 10 mumol/L) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in GM-CSF-or IL-3-induced proliferation of up to 1.8-fold. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may be important for GM-CSF and IL-3 receptor-mediated signal transduction and that cell proliferation may be, at least partially, regulated by a balance between CSF-induced protein-tyrosine kinase activity and protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Since enrichment of human bone-marrow hematopoietic progenitors is becoming more feasible and since purified growth factors are now available, we sought to study the action of growth factors on CD34-positive enriched cultures of human bone-marrow cells. We tested the effect of recombinant human (rh) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), rh interleukin-3 (IL-3), or a unique biologic response modifier, bryostatin 1, on the growth of purified CD34 cells obtained by limiting dilution in single-cell cultures. We have shown previously that bryostatin 1 stimulates both myeloid and erythroid progenitors of human origin in vitro. In this study both IL-3 and GM-CSF supported colony formation from 500, 100, or single-cell cultures at equivalent plating efficiences, suggesting a direct action of these factors on hematopoietic cell growth. Conversely, bryostatin 1 did not support the growth of CD34 cells in single-cell cultures, and the cloning efficiency increased with increasing the number of cells in the culture. To test whether the indirect action of bryostatin 1 might be mediated through the production of growth factors by accessory cells, studies were performed using antibodies directed against human IL-3 and GM-CSF in culture with bryostatin 1 and normal human bone-marrow cells. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that bryostatin 1 could have a stimulatory effect on the accessory cell populations to produce either IL-3 or GM-CSF. Further support for this notion was obtained by demonstrating that T cells, which are cells known to be able to produce IL-3 and GM-CSF, are stimulated by bryostatin 1 to express messenger RNA (mRNA) for specific growth factors, including GM-CSF. These results provide further support that bryostatin 1 may be a useful clinical agent to stimulate hematopoiesis in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90345032\r", 
  ".W": "We discovered that the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, CALLA (CD10), was identical to human neutral endopeptidase 3.4.24.11 (NEP), a Zn-binding glycoprotein with an extracellular active site capable of hydrolyzing several biologically active peptides. In this study we compare the expression of CALLA/NEP in terms of antigenic density and enzymatic activity at the cell surface and of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels on granulocytes, leukemic cells, and CALLA-transfected COS-1 cells. Mature granulocytes, the only readily available source of normal human CALLA, express relatively low but constant levels of antigen, NEP activity (3.5 pmol/min/10(6) cells), and mRNA. The two major CALLA-mRNA species of 6.5 kb and 3.8 kb, observed to date in a variety of cells and tissues, were also found in four independent granulocyte preparations. With leukemia cell lines, a correlation was established between the density of CALLA antigen and the level of enzymatic activity (3.4 to 21.0 pmol/min/10(6) cells). This paper constitutes the first report of NEP activity on blast cells derived from patients with non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); the levels of activity were variable (1.5 to 35.9 pmol/min/10(6) cells for six cases) but correlated with the level of CALLA assessed by flow cytometry. Heterogeneous levels of expression of the CALLA-mRNA species were also observed in non-T ALL cases that correlated with the level of CALLA expression at the surface of these cells. Very high levels of NEP activity were achieved by transfecting COS-1 cells with pSV-CALLA; 20% of the transfected cells were CALLA+ and expressed 550 pmol/min/10(6) cells. Extracts prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with pSV-CALLA (carrying human NEP cDNA) and pSVENK19 (carrying rabbit NEP-cDNA), respectively, gave Michaelis constant (Km) values of 50 mumol/L and similar inhibition curves with thiorphan. Thus the recombinant proteins encoded by these two genes have similar enzymatic properties, confirming the high degree of their structural relatedness. The expression of high levels of CALLA/NEP on COS-1 cells should allow the use of this system to test the effects of specific mutations on activity and might lead to the understanding of the role of CALLA in the onset and/or progression of leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two extranodal lymphomas of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract underwent molecular genetic analysis by Southern blotting using probes for the immunoglobulin genes and the bcl-1, bcl-2, and c-myc loci, commonly involved in lymphomagenesis. No bcl-1 rearrangements were found. There was only one large-cell lymphoma with a bcl-2 rearrangement. A rearrangement of the c-myc gene was found in six of eight Burkittlike lymphomas of the intestine. In five of these six cases, a chromosomal translocation t(8;14) with an unusual breakpoint was demonstrated by comigration of the rearranged c-myc and a rearranged JH sequence. This pattern of rearrangement has not been previously associated with a specific group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In contrast to all six low-grade lymphomas, c-myc rearrangements were found in 6 of 12 large-cell or high-grade mucosa-associated lymphomas of the stomach. No comigration of c-myc and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene sequences were found. We conclude that primary GI lymphomas have different molecular genetic characteristics compared with node-based follicle center-cell lymphoma and as a group are not related to these lymphomas. In addition, the prevalence and patterns of c-myc rearrangements in the gastric large-cell lymphomas and ileocecal Burkittlike lymphomas are noteworthy and suggest a different and distinct pathogenesis for these tumors.\r"

We directly sequenced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified N-ras fragments to determine the frequency of N-ras point mutations in 55 adult patients with de novo AML. Mutations were present in 8 of 55 (15%) patients. These mutations were usually in codon 12, 13, or 61, but one patient had mutations in both codons 13 and 61, and another had an unusual point mutation in N-ras codon 60. A comparison of patients with and without N-ras mutations showed no statistically significant differences in pretreatment clinical variables, response to induction therapy, or survival, except for a possibly higher percentage of FAB M4 subtypes in patients with the N-ras mutation. These data together with previous reports suggest that the presence of N-ras point mutations do not clearly define a unique clinical or biologic subset of AML patients.\r"

  ".W": "The ontogeny of a 57-Kd cationic antimicrobial protein (CAP57) that has substantial similarities to bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) has been determined immunocytochemically. CAP57 was detected in the granules of mature peripheral blood neutrophils. However, it was absent from other cells of the peripheral blood: eosinophils, red blood cells (RBCs), and mononuclear cells. In human bone marrow, CAP57 was confined to the neutrophilic series. The earliest stage of development of the myeloid cells at which CAP57 was demonstrated was the promyelocyte. Double immunofluorescent labeling showed that CAP57 was detected in cells positive for myeloperoxidase. The absence of lactoferrin in certain cells (promyelocytes) containing CAP57 indicated that CAP57 was synthesized and packaged in a population of granules prior to the development of granules that contain lactoferrin. CAP57 could not be demonstrated in HL60 cells either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or by immunocytochemistry. However, the presence of another granule-associated cationic antimicrobial protein of molecular weight 37 Kd (CAP37) was readily detected in undifferentiated HL60 cells. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that CAP57 and BPI were identical. Further indication of the identity between CAP57 and BPI was that monoclonal anti-CAP57 antibodies cross reacted with BPI. Sucrose density-gradient centrifugations showed CAP57 was confined to a granule population that exhibited a buoyant density intermediate of the previously described light and heavy azurophil granules. Further resolution of the individual azurophil granule populations by Percoll density-gradient centrifugation revealed that CAP57 was most concentrated in the density range of 1.093 to 1.100 g/cc. These results strongly suggest the unique finding that CAP57 may be associated with a heretofore unreported granule type.\r"

  ".W": "It is apparent from review of published papers and books that misunderstanding and confusion exists in the minds of many authors describing the interaction of penetrating missiles with tissues. These misapprehensions may influence the management of wounds by suggesting didactic approaches based upon a preconceived notion of the nature and severity of the wound for different types of projectiles. This review considers the biophysics of penetrating missile wounds, highlights some of the more common misconceptions and seeks to reconcile the conflicting and confusing management doctrines that are promulgated in the literature-differences that arise not only from two scenarios, peace and war, but also from misapprehensions of the wounding process. Wounds of war and of peacetime differ both in the nature of the wound and in the propensity for wound infection. Additionally, the limitations imposed by war dictate the type of management that may be practised and result in procedures that would be considered inappropriate by some in civilian clinical practice. Many of the procedures described in civilian peacetime settings, such as reliance on antibiotics alone for the control of infection in penetrating wounds, or minimal excision and debridement, can yield good results but would herald disaster if transposed to a war setting.\r"

CST gave a positive result in only eight out of 24 patients with a colorectal cancer (sensitivity = 33 per cent) compared with 13 out of 24 for Haemoccult (sensitivity = 54 per cent). CST had no advantage from increased compliance to outweigh its lower sensitivity.\r"

Analysis of oestrogen receptor activity in the carcinomas was not performed. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups according to age, Karnofsky performance index, tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage, operative treatment or other patient characteristics. The tamoxifen or placebo treatment continued to death or to 10 months after accrual into the trial was stopped. In the tamoxifen group, the mean and median survivals were 205 and 115 days, respectively. These values did not differ statistically from the 192 and 122 days, respectively, observed in the placebo group. Additional retrospective analyses of sex and stage revealed no beneficial effect of tamoxifen upon survival. For women in stage III (any T N1 M0), mean and median survivals were 255 and 191 days, respectively, compared with values of 84 and 45 days, respectively, in the placebo group (P = 0.011). After 2.5 years, three (7 per cent) women in the tamoxifen group were still alive compared with no survivors in the placebo group. No male patients survived beyond 2.5 years. This therapeutic result in a small subgroup of women is probably incidental and not an effect of tamoxifen.\r"

Twenty-three patients (62 per cent) had serious concomitant diseases. Plain abdominal radiographs performed at admission were diagnostic in only 17 patients (46 per cent) and other procedures such as ultrasonography, gastrointestinal contrast studies and computed tomographic scan were required in ten patients (27 per cent). The diagnosis was made before operation in 27 patients (73 per cent) but in only 17 (46 per cent) at admission. Obstructing stones were located in the terminal ileum in 27 patients (73 per cent), in the proximal ileum or jejunum in five (14 per cent), in the duodenum in two (5 per cent), and in the colon in three (8 per cent). In six instances (16 per cent), more than one stone was involved. Cholecystduodenal fistula was the most frequent fistula type (n = 25, 68 per cent), followed by cholecystcolonic (n = 2, 5 per cent) and cholecystduodenocolonic (n = 2, 5 per cent) types. The site of the fistula was not established in the other eight instances. A one-stage procedure consisting of the removal of the impacted stone, fistula repair and cholecystectomy was performed in eight patients, two of whom died. A second group of six patients underwent a two-stage procedure consisting of enterolithotomy followed by elective biliary surgery, with no mortality. Removal of impacted stones was the only surgical treatment in the remaining 23 patients, with five deaths. Operative mortality and morbidity rates associated with the initial procedure did not differ significantly among the three therapeutic groups, which were comparable in terms of patient age, associated concomitant diseases and APACHE II score. However, later biliary complications were prominent in patients treated only by enterolithotomy. These results support the view that a one-stage procedure is, when feasible, a valid option and may be the procedure of choice. When local or surgical conditions argue against a one-stage procedure, biliary surgery at a second stage should be considered, if residual stones are present. In poor risk patients, non-operative methods should be considered.\r"

Sixty-one patients were randomized, 20 to receive no treatment, 22 to receive HAE, and 19 to receive HAI with 5-fluorouracil and degradable starch microspheres. Both treatments were acceptable to the patients in terms of low treatment morbidity rate. Median survival from diagnosis of metastases was 9.6 months for controls, 8.7 months for the HAE group and 13.0 months in the HAI group. There was no apparent survival benefit for the HAE group. The increased survival in the HAI group was observed in all the subgroups analysed but failed to reach statistical significance. The greatest observed benefit was achieved in the subgroup with less than 50 per cent hepatic replacement with tumour at presentation (median survival from diagnosis 10.0 months for controls, 10.2 months for HAE and 23.6 months for HAI); 36 per cent of patients developed extrahepatic disease recurrence. No significant benefit has been shown from either HAE or HAI, but a more carefully selected group of patients with only low volume hepatic disease may benefit from HAI therapy.\r"

Two patients died in the immediate perioperative period leaving 20 patients available for long-term follow-up (mean 43.3 months). Three recurrent gastric ulcers were diagnosed, two of these presenting with haemorrhage. No patient presented with further gastric ulceration while on histamine (H2) receptor antagonist therapy. The long-term outcome of undersewing alone, when combined with maintenance H2-receptor antagonist therapy, is satisfactory in terms of low mortality and low risk of ulcer recurrence.\r"

Continuous 24-hr pH monitoring with glass electrodes was performed under fed conditions. The median 24-hr pH decreased from 3.2 on day 1 with famotidine 40 mg to 1.9 on day 28 (P less than 0.0012). After seven days of dosing with ranitidine 300 mg four times a day the median 24-hr pH dropped from 5.0 on day 1 to 3.0 on day 7 (P less than 0.001) and then to 2.2 with ranitidine 300 mg at night on day 28. With ranitidine 300 mg three times a day the median 24-hr pH fell from 4.3 on day 1 to 2.4 on day 14 (P less than 0.0005). With ranitidine 300 mg at night the respective pH values were 2.5 and 1.8 (P less than 0.003). Tolerance to H2-receptor antagonists given in a single evening dose was only evident during the night, whereas tolerance occurred throughout the day and night with the three- and four-times-a-day regimens. A large increase in the interindividual variability of pH response was seen during the nighttime.\r"

In some instances, these discrete domains are encoded by individual exons. This organizational model of the insulin receptor predicts the existence of divergent signaling pathways facilitating specific bioeffects. Some of these signaling pathways are shared with the closely related insulinlike growth factor I receptor (convergent pathways), whereas others are different (divergent). The concept of discrete functional domains also provides several mechanisms whereby inactive insulin receptors (no kinase activity) can inhibit the function of normal receptors. The ability of kinase-inactive insulin receptors to inhibit the signaling function of normal insulin receptors may be an operative mechanism in certain insulin-resistant states.\r"

  ".W": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects exhibit abnormalities in their plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles that increase the risk of ischemic heart disease. This study was designed to examine the metabolic behavior of very-low-density (VLDL), intermediate-density (IDL), and low-density (LDL) lipoproteins in NIDDM patients before treatment and after 4 wk of insulin therapy. Basal turnover studies of 131I-labeled VLDL1 (svedberg units [Sf] 60-400) and 131I-labeled VLDL2 (Sf 20-60) apolipoprotein B (apoB) were conducted in a group of seven NIDDM patients who had been off oral therapy for 1 wk. The subjects exhibited higher than normal transport rates for VLDL1 and a diminished input of apoB into the VLDL2 density range. These observations are concordant with the hypothesis that NIDDM patients overproduce VLDL triglyceride but not apoB. VLDL1 and VLDL2 were converted to IDL and ultimately to LDL at approximately normal rates, although the delipidation pathway by which apoB-containing particles were processed exhibited different properties from that seen in control subjects. Insulin therapy reduced plasma triglyceride by 38%, and this was associated with a 41% fall in VLDL1 mass (P less than 0.01). VLDL2 was less affected (19% reduction, P less than 0.05), IDL was unchanged, and LDL fell 17% (P less than 0.05). Repeat metabolic studies revealed that the major effects of insulin were to reduce VLDL1-apoB transport (from 811 to 488 mg/day) and increase the direct input of VLDL2 into the plasma (from 182 to 533 mg/day, P less than 0.05). These alterations in VLDL production led to normalization of apoB kinetics in IDL and LDL. The fractional catabolic rate of LDL increased 19% (P less than 0.05), whereas direct input into this fraction, which had been high before treatment, was reduced. Postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase levels were unaffected by insulin, although the hormone did increase LPL in adipose tissue. This lack of effect on lipase activities correlated well with the observation that the rates of catabolism of apoB in VLDL1, VLDL2, and IDL were not significantly affected by insulin therapy.\r"

Human insulin and the low- and high-affinity analogues showed equivalent glucose utilization rates in the steady state (mean +/- SE 14.7 +/- 1.4, 12.7 +/- 1.5, and 12.2 +/- 1.2 mg.kg-1.min-1, respectively; n = 7). The corresponding plasma insulin levels, however, were markedly different (329 +/- 25 and 856 +/- 46 pM, P less than 0.05; 197 +/- 19 pM, P less than 0.05). There was an inverse relationship between the insulin levels and the in vitro activities measured by binding to human hepatoma cells (HepG2; 100, 20, and 308%) or by incorporation of glucose into lipids in mouse free fat cells (100, 31, and 207%). The total amount of glucose infused during and after insulin infusion was equal for the three insulins, whereas glucose utilization as a function of time was somewhat different. By describing the individual plasma concentration courses with an open two-compartment model with elimination from the receptor compartment, the time courses for binding and elimination of the three insulins in the receptor compartment were estimated. The effect seems closely linked to the elimination of insulin from the receptors rather than to the amount of insulin bound to the receptors. In conclusion, the total effect of equimolar amounts of human insulin and the two insulin analogues on glucose utilization is equal regardless of the different receptor affinities of the insulins.\r"

  ".W": "A direct effect of growth hormone and/or prolactin on the growth of the pancreatic beta-cell has been proposed. This study assessed the presence of human growth hormone (hGH)-binding sites in male adult rat endocrine pancreas via quantitative autoradiography. The binding of 125I-labeled hGH was evaluated by receptor autoradiography on frozen-pancreas cryostat cut sections. The sections were incubated with 125I-hGH (10(-10) M) for 75 min at room temperature, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess native hGH (5 X 10(-7) M). The specificity of the binding was assessed in competition experiments with bovine GH and ovine prolactin. The autoradiograms were quantified with a computer-assisted image-processing system. The sections were then stained to visualize the endocrine islets. Nondiabetic control and streptozocin (STZ)-injected rats were used. Our results show that 1) there is specific binding of iodinated hGH in small areas of the pancreas, which appear as the Langerhans islets when the autoradiogram and the stained sections are superimposed; 2) the specificity of hGH binding in rat islets is lactogenic; 3) the density of the hGH-binding sites in the endocrine pancreas is estimated at 4.8 fmol/mg protein, with IC50 ranging from 0.98 to 2.50 nM; and 4) binding sites may be present on the beta-cell, because specific binding disappears in STZ-injected rats. In conclusion, by use of a quantitative autoradiographic technique, we provide evidence for the presence of lactogenic receptors on rat beta-cells.\r"

Plasma glucose levels were significantly elevated with age in Wistar fatty rats, whereas they were virtually unchanged in VMH-lesioned and Zucker fatty rats. Obesity and hyperinsulinemia were evident in VMH-lesioned rats 1 wk after the operation and in Zucker and Wistar fatty rats at 5 wk of age. In VMH-lesioned rats, the pancreatic preproinsulin I mRNA (pplmRNA) level and pancreatic insulin content markedly increased approximately two- to threefold (P less than 0.001) with the development of hyperinsulinemia, whereas sham-operated rats showed no significant change. In Zucker and Wistar lean rats, the pplmRNA level and pancreatic insulin content increased with age, corresponding to increases in body weight. In Zucker fatty rats, the pplmRNA level and pancreatic insulin content at 5 and 14 wk of age were significantly higher than those of lean littermates. The pplmRNA level in Zucker fatty rats at 14 wk of age reached 290% of that of their lean littermates (P less than 0.001). On the other hand, the pplmRNA level and pancreatic insulin content in Wistar fatty rats at 5 and 14 wk of age did not increase more than those of their lean littermates at the corresponding ages and were therefore significantly lower than in Zucker fatty rats, which had a higher grade of hyperinsulinemia at 14 wk of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Free fatty acids are known to inhibit carbohydrate disposal and oxidation. This action may play an important role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. To investigate whether amino acids (AAs) have similar actions, we determined the effects of an intravenously infused mixture of 15 AAs on carbohydrate disposal during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps associated with either basal or high glucagon concentrations in healthy male volunteers. Plasma glucose concentration was clamped at approximately 4.7 mM (coefficient of variation 4.7%). Insulin infusion (7.18 pmol.kg-1.min-1) raised serum insulin concentrations from 36-50 pM to between 300 and 600 pM. AA infusions (0.5 g.kg-1.h-1.4 h) raised plasma alpha-amino N2 concentrations about five- to six-fold. Infusion of AAs, somatostatin (somatotropin release inhibitory factor, SRIF), and high-glucagon replacement (3.0 ng.kg-1.min-1) reduced the rate of exogenous glucose infusion needed to maintain euglycemia from 51.1 +/- 7.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (saline + SRIF + high glucagon) to 28.3 +/- 11.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1 and stimulated endogenous glucose production (from 0 to approximately 17 mumol.kg-1.min-1). Thus, glucose disposal (exogenous infusion plus endogenous production of glucose) remained essentially unchanged. During infusion of AAs + SRIF + basal glucagon replacement (0.25 ng.kg-1.min-1), endogenous glucose production remained completely suppressed, and the rates of exogenous glucose infusion did not change (compared with saline + SRIF + basal glucagon replacement). The data showed that 1) hyperaminoacidemia associated with hyperglucagonemia stimulated endogenous glucose production despite hyperinsulinemia, and 2) intravenous infusion of a mixture of 15 AAs had no inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated total-body glucose disposal.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies showed that islet cell autoantibodies are present at the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in humans and in rodent models of this disease. The targets of these antibodies are not well characterized. Using an immunoblot assay on protein extracts from rat insulinoma (RIN) cells (RINm5F), we showed that serums from nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice bind to a 52,000-Mr islet cell antigen. Nondiabetic NON mice do not have antibodies to this antigen. The NOD and NON serums also contained antibodies to salivary gland proteins. Analysis of the tissue distribution of the 52,000-Mr antigen revealed that it is present in purified RINm5F membranes but is not found in other endocrine or nonendocrine tissues. Autoantibodies to an antigen of similar molecular weight are detected in 29% of human IDDM serums. To determine whether the autoantibodies from mouse and human serums bind the same antigen, two-dimensional immunoblots were carried out. The 52,000-Mr protein isoforms appeared identical when probed with NOD and human IDDM serums. We conclude that serums from NOD mice and some humans with IDDM contain similar autoantibodies to a 52,000-Mr RINm5F cell-specific membrane protein. The presence of autoantibodies to this 52,000-Mr islet cell protein at the onset of the disease suggests that it may be an important antigen in IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier, and insulin receptors have been detected in different structures of the brain. However, the biological significance of insulin acting in the brain remains unclear. Reports of differential awareness of hypoglycemic symptoms during human insulin (HI)- and pork insulin (PI)-induced hypoglycemia hint at a modulatory influence of insulin on sensory processing. In a double-blind study, we recorded auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs), indexing neuronal transmission along sensory pathways, in 30 healthy male subjects during a baseline condition and HI- and PI-induced mild hypoglycemia of 2.65 mM. Fifteen subjects were tested after 20 min and another 15 after 50 min of constant hypoglycemia. During hypoglycemia, subjects had to indicate the severity of hypoglycemic symptoms and their current mood. Hypoglycemia increased latencies of the P3 component and reduced amplitudes of the N1, P2, and P3 components. Despite identical blood glucose and serum insulin levels in both sessions, effects of PI-induced hypoglycemia on AEP components were significantly stronger than those of HI-induced hypoglycemia (P less than 0.05). Differences between the effects of the insulins were consistently apparent after 20 min of hypoglycemia, indicating a short-term action of these hormones on central nervous system functions. Also, after 20 min, but not after 50 min, of steady-state hypoglycemia, subjects felt more excited during PI than HI infusion (P less than 0.05). The results indicate different influences of HI and PI on sensory function during hypoglycemia. These differences, occurring during early hypoglycemia, could contribute to the differential awareness of hypoglycemic warning symptoms during HI- and PI-induced hypoglycemia in diabetic patients.\r"

Rates of glycogen synthesis (GS), glucose utilization via glycolysis, glycolytic utilization (GU), and glucose transport (GT) were studied in epitrochlearis muscles (EMs) obtained from 10-wk-old nonfasted Sprague-Dawley rats in which NIDDM was neonatally induced with streptozocin. Plasma glucose in NIDDM rats was elevated (P less than 0.001), whereas plasma insulin was similar in NIDDM and control rats. No differences in muscle weight, protein, glycogen, ATP, phosphocreatine, lactate, lactate-pyruvate ratios, or glucose-6-phosphate were noted in EMs of control and NIDDM rats. EMs were incubated in medium containing 5.6 or 11.2 mM glucose with tracer D-[5-3H]glucose and insulin from 0 to 7.18 x 10(-7) M for 1 or 2 h, and GS, GT, and GU were evaluated. Similar rates of basal (non-insulin-mediated) and insulin-stimulated GS, GU, and GT were observed in EMs of NIDDM and control rats incubated in 5.6 mM glucose for 2 h. Insulin dose-response curves revealed similar sensitivities and responsiveness. Increasing glucose concentration (from 5.6 to 11.2 mM) induced significant increases in basal rates of GS, GU, and GT in EMs of control but not NIDDM rats. Insulin dose-response curves for GS and GT revealed decreased sensitivity and no change in responsiveness in EMs of control and NIDDM rats, even though GU of EMs of NIDDM rats was significantly lower at basal and all other insulin concentrations. These data revealed that both insulin resistance and glucose resistance contribute to the impaired glucose metabolism in EMs of the NIDDM rat.\r"

All 1212 subjects were followed for 8 yr for the development of IDDM. Fifty children (4.1%) were positive for conventional ICAs (IF-ICAs) in 1980 (range 3-80 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units [JDF U]; median 30 JDF U), of which 12 (1.0%) had complement-fixing ICAs (CF-ICAs) in their serums (range 3-30 JDF U; median 8 JDF U). None were exclusively CF-ICA+. Boys were CF-ICA+ more often than girls (9 of 563 [1.6%] vs. 3 of 649 [0.5%], respectively; P less than 0.05). Over the next 6 yr, 4 of 39 subjects lost their IF-ICAs, and 4 of 12 lost their CF-ICAs without progressing to diabetes. The initial IF-ICA levels in these subjects were lower (range 3-8 JDF U; median 7 JDF U; P less than 0.05) than those in the persistent cases. In the initially ICA- subgroup (n = 296), 7 subjects (2.4%) later became IF-ICA+, and 4 (1.4%) became CF-ICA+. The levels of ICA in these subjects were lower than in the originally ICA+ ones (P less than 0.05), and 3 IF-ICA+ and 2 CF-ICA+ subjects again became ICA- before 1986.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Finally, students identified an ambulatory patient at risk for substance abuse and performed an evaluation. All 33 unselected students gave high ratings to all of the learning activities and the entire curriculum. Almost all were satisfied with the emphasis on substance abuse in their clerkship and expressed motivation to learn more. Student acceptance of teaching on substance abuse can be attained by a curriculum in which goals, objectives, and expectations are delineated clearly; in which the content is clinically relevant; which uses computer-assisted instruction, role playing, and a clinical exercise to stimulate problem-solving and skill development; in which conferences are discussion oriented; and for which pretests are used to promote learner receptivity.\r"

In all studies designed to obtain normative data, methodologic issues need careful attention. For some purposes, normative data may be quickly obtained in cross-sectional studies. When age effects are to be described or when time is an important consideration, longitudinal study designs may be needed to evaluate potential cohort effects and epoch effects. Especially important in studies which seek normative data are precise characterization of the study population, clear definition and measurement of phenomena, and appropriate interpretation and generalization of results.\r"

The lung volume, tracheal flow, and transpulmonary pressure of tracheotomized and paralyzed rats were measured with a fluid-filled esophageal catheter and a pressure-sensitive body plethysmograph. RL was calculated by the method of von Neergaard. The femoral artery was cannulated to measure the mean arterial blood pressure. Intravenous bolus administration of synthetic ET-1 provoked a dose-dependent increase in RL in rats. The bronchoconstricting effect reached maximum at 500 pmol/kg. This bronchoconstriction was observed in less than 5 min, increased up to 15 min, and was sustained for 60 min. ET-1 increased the mean arterial blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that ET-1 is a hitherto unknown potent bronchoconstrictor that has a sustained effect in vivo. The potential physiological and pathophysiological role of this new peptide in the development of respiratory disease warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "In five anesthetized paralyzed cats, mechanically ventilated with tidal volumes of 36-48 ml, the isovolume pressure-flow (IVPF) relationships of the lung were studied under control conditions and during serotonin-induced bronchoconstriction. At the end of a tidal inspiration, airway opening pressure was set between +3 and -15 cmH2O for single tidal expirations. After control measurements, animals were treated with progressively increasing doses of intravenous serotonin (10, 20, 50, and 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and all measurements were repeated at each dose. No animal became flow limited during passive expiration against atmospheric pressure. Disregarding flow-limited segments, IVPF plots for three lung volumes showed that the resistive pressure-flow relationships were curvilinear under all conditions, thus fitting Rohrer's equation. Under control conditions and during the lowest dose of serotonin, the volume dependence of pulmonary resistance (RL) tended to balance its flow dependence so that during lung deflation against atmospheric pressure RL remained nearly constant. However, as bronchoconstriction became more pronounced, RL often increased disproportionately at the lower lung volumes. Changes in expiratory RL with serotonin relative to control values varied according to the flow rates used to make comparisons. The technique used to determine RL will partly determine the results obtained.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of continuous and intermittent electrical stimulation protocols of different intensities on exogenous FFA oxidation, exogenous FFA incorporation into intracellular TG, and intracellular TG content in the isolated in vitro rat flexor digitorum brevis muscle preparation. Muscles were electrically stimulated for 0.5 h continuously at 0.2 Hz or intermittently (30 s on, 60 s off) at 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 5.0 Hz while incubated at 37 degrees C in 0.5 mM palmitate-3% bovine serum albumin medium (pH 7.4) in the presence of insulin (100 microU/ml) and glucose (11 mM). Control muscles were frozen immediately after excision or incubated for 0.5 h. At similar frequencies, less exogenous FFA esterification and more exogenous FFA oxidation occurred during continuous than during intermittent stimulation. As the frequency of intermittent stimulation increased, the amount of exogenous FFA esterified decreased and the amount of exogenous FFA oxidized increased. The data also indicate that at least a portion of TG was constantly being hydrolyzed during electrical stimulation. Under stimulation conditions in which exogenous FFA esterification was below the control (resting muscle) level, intramuscular TG content was significantly decreased compared with control TG content values. Thus both plasma FFA and intramuscular TG are substrates for energy production during electrical stimulation. However, the stimulation parameters employed affect the quantities utilized.\r"

  ".W": "A computational model for expiration from lungs with mechanical nonhomogeneities was used to investigate the effect of such nonhomogeneities on the distribution of expiratory flow and the development of alveolar pressure differences between regions. The nonhomogeneities used were a modest constriction of the peripheral airways and a 50% difference in compliance between regions. The model contains only two mechanically different regions but allows these to be as grossly distributed as left lung-right lung or to be distributed as a set of identical pairs of parallel nonhomogeneous regions with flows from each merging in a specified bronchial generation. The site of flow merging had no effect on the flow-volume curve but had a significant effect on the development of alveolar pressure differences (delta PA). With the peripheral constriction, greater values of delta PA developed when flows were merged peripherally rather than centrally. The opposite was true in the case of a compliance nonhomogeneity. The delta PA values were smaller at submaximal flows. Plots of delta PA vs. lung volume were similar to those obtained experimentally. These results were interpreted in terms of the expression used for the fluid mechanics of the merging flows. delta PA was greater when the viscosity of the expired gas was increased or when its density was reduced. Partial forced expirations were shown to indicate the presence of mechanical nonhomogeneity.\r"

  ".W": "Samples of human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and urine were utilized to demonstrate methods for quantitation and validation of leukotrienes (LTs). These methods utilize an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that uses commercially available reagents, the antibody recognizing LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and N-acetyl LTE4. BALF containing epithelial lining fluid was collected from atopic asthmatics both before and 5 min after the subjects had been challenged with a local instillation of allergen into the airways. BALF samples collected without allergen challenge had low levels of immunoreactive LTs, whereas samples collected after allergen were markedly elevated. After high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of LTs, EIA revealed the presence of LTC4. The identity was validated by incubating LTC4 with a bovine gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase with dipeptidase activity that converted added [3H]-LTC4 as well as LTC4 immunoreactivity to LTE4. Urine samples collected from six healthy volunteers, one patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and three patients in status asthmaticus were also analyzed for LTs. After HPLC separation of LTs and quantitation by EIA, urine samples from healthy subjects were found to have low but measurable LTE4. In contrast, the urine samples from the patients in status asthmaticus and from the ARDS patient had large elevations of LTE4 levels compared with healthy subjects. When the HPLC fractions containing [3H]LTE4 and LT immunoreactivity in the ARDS sample were treated with acetic anhydride, HPLC analysis indicated that both radiolabel and immunoreactivity now eluted at the retention time of N-acetyl LTE4, the derivatized product of LTE4. The methods described are relatively easy and can be used to measure and validate the existence of peptidoleukotrienes in biological samples.\r"

Ascending venography identified thrombosis in about one-third of the patients who received the combination of antithrombin III and heparin, compared with about four-fifths of those who received dextran (p less than 0.001). In both groups, the patients who had venous thrombosis had a significantly lower concentration of antithrombin III postoperatively than those who did not have thrombosis. Venous thrombosis occurred in all patients in whom the concentration of antithrombin III was less than 65 per cent postoperatively. These findings demonstrated that, after total knee replacement, the combination of antithrombin III and heparin effectively reduces the incidence of postoperative venous thrombosis and is significantly better than dextran. Furthermore, the findings suggested a relationship between postoperative deficiency of antithrombin III and the occurrence of thrombotic complications.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of the accuracy of real-time B-mode ultrasonography in detecting deep venous thrombosis in the femoral and popliteal veins of the lower extremity was conducted on a consecutive series of patients who had had a total hip replacement. Ascending venography was used as a diagnostic standard. One hundred and forty-three patients had ultrasound studies of both lower extremities and a venographic study of the operatively treated lower extremity at an average of 7.6 days postoperatively. The two tests were done within twenty-four hours of each other. Both ultrasonography and venography were done on 152 extremities. Two paired studies were excluded from the analysis of results because the ultrasound scans could not be interpreted. In 131 extremities, both diagnostic tests were negative for proximal thrombosis. Eight extremities had isolated thrombosis of a vein in the calf that was detected only by venography. In nineteen extremities, old or fresh thrombosis was diagnosed by venography. In four extremities, an old thrombosis of the superficial femoral vein was detected by both studies. In four of the extremities that had a new thrombus in the common femoral vein and in nine that had a new thrombus in the superficial femoral vein, abnormal findings on ultrasound scans correlated with those on venograms. There were two false-negative ultrasound scans and one false-negative venogram. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasonography were 89, 100, and 99 per cent for the diagnosis of thrombosis of the proximal veins of the lower limb and 63, 100, and 93 per cent for the diagnosis of thrombosis when the entire venous system of the limb was included.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We demonstrated here that a large proportion of TcR gamma delta cells, i.e., up to 30% of mononuclear cells (MNC) were detectable in the liver, but not other lymphoid organs of cancer patients. More importantly, the majority of such TcR gamma delta cells (greater than 70%) were shown to be lymphoblastic by electron microscopy. An activation marker of T lymphocytes, Leu-19 (CD56) was also highly expressed on the hepatic TcR gamma delta cells. The possibility of hepatic TcR gamma delta cells being activated was further examined in mice. C3H/He mice injected with syngeneic tumor cells were demonstrated to have an increased number of liver MNC; such MNC showed an ability to proliferate in vitro. These mice eventually had a considerable proportion of TcR gamma delta cells in the liver, showing activation markers, the Ia and LFA-1 antigens. These results suggest that the liver may be an important organ for activation and probably expansion of TcR gamma delta cells especially in tumor bearing hosts.\r"

  ".U": "90347040\r", 
  ".W": "Glomerular accumulation of extracellular matrix is a prominent feature of progressive glomerulonephritis. Previously, we have shown that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is unique among growth factors in regulating the production of the proteoglycans biglycan and decorin by glomerular mesangial cells in vitro. We now provide evidence of an elevated expression of TGF-beta, proteoglycans, and fibronectin in glomerulonephritis induced in rats by injection of anti-thymocyte serum (ATS). Glomeruli were cultured from rat kidneys at 1, 4, 7, 14, and 28 d after ATS administration. Increased proteoglycan synthesis was detected beginning on day 4, which peaked at a 4,900% increase compared with control on day 7, and returned toward control levels by day 28. The increased proteoglycan synthesis by cultured nephritic glomeruli, as well as that of fibronectin, were greatly reduced by addition of antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide from TGF-beta. Conditioned media from ATS glomerular cultures, when added to normal cultured mesangial cells, induced elevated proteoglycan synthesis that also peaked on day 7 and that mimicked the response to added exogenous TGF-beta. The stimulatory activity of the conditioned media was blocked by addition of TGF-beta antiserum. Prior addition of the immunizing peptide to the antiserum abolished the blocking effect. The main induced proteoglycans were identified as biglycan and decorin by immunoprecipitation with antiserum made against synthetic peptides from the proteoglycan core proteins. Glomerular histology showed mesangial matrix expansion in a time course that roughly paralleled both the elevated proteoglycan synthesis by the ATS glomeruli and the ability of the conditioned media from these glomeruli to induce proteoglycan synthesis. At the same time there was an increased expression of TGF-beta mRNA and TGF-beta protein in the glomeruli. These results suggest a central role for TGF-beta in the accumulation of pathological extracellular matrix in glomerulonephritis.\r"

Rats given streptozotocin (STZ) 65 mg/kg i.v. (n = 14) were compared with untreated age-matched controls (n = 15) and rats treated with insulin after administration of STZ (n = 11). After 7 d, diabetic rats exhibited decreases in heart rate and peak developed left ventricular (LV) pressure during aortic occlusion. After 26 d of diabetes there were significant decreases in resting LV systolic pressure, developed pressure, and maximal +dP/dt, whereas LV end-diastolic pressure increased and the time constant of LV relaxation was prolonged. The passive LV pressure-volume relationship was progressively shifted away from the pressure axis, and the overall chamber stiffness constant was decreased. However, \"operating chamber stiffness\" calculated at end-diastolic pressure was increased at 7 d, and unchanged at 26 d. LV cavity/wall volume and end-diastolic volume were increased after 26 d of diabetes. Myocardial stiffness was unchanged at both time intervals. All of the above abnormalities were reversed by the administration of insulin. We conclude that the hemodynamic and passive-elastic changes that occur in diabetic rats represent an early dilated cardiomyopathy which is reversible with insulin.\r"

  ".U": "90347044\r", 
  ".W": "It has been proposed that increased supply of gluconeogenic precursors may be largely responsible for the increased gluconeogenesis which contributes to fasting hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Therefore, to test the hypothesis that an increase in gluconeogenic substrate supply per se could increase hepatic glucose output sufficiently to cause fasting hyperglycemia, we infused normal volunteers with sodium lactate at a rate approximately double the rate of appearance observed in NIDDM while clamping plasma insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone at basal levels. In control experiments, sodium bicarbonate was infused instead of sodium lactate at equimolar rates. In both experiments, [6-3H]-glucose was infused to measure glucose appearance and either [U-14C]lactate or [U-14C]alanine was infused to measure the rates of appearance and conversion of these substrates into plasma glucose. Plasma insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, C-peptide, and glycerol concentrations, and blood bicarbonate and pH in control and lactate infusion experiments were not significantly different. Infusion of lactate increased plasma lactate and alanine to 4.48 +/- 3 mM and 610 +/- 33 microM, respectively, from baseline values of 1.6 +/- 0.2 mM and 431 +/- 28 microM, both P less than 0.01; lactate and alanine rates of appearance increased to 38 +/- 1.0 and 8.0 +/- 0.3 mumol/kg per min (P less than 0.01 versus basal rates of 14.4 +/- 0.4 and 5.0 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg per min, respectively). With correction for Krebs cycle carbon exchange, lactate incorporation into plasma glucose increased nearly threefold to 10.4 mumol/kg per min and accounted for about 50% of overall glucose appearance. Alanine incorporation into plasma glucose increased more than twofold. Despite this marked increase in gluconeogenesis, neither overall hepatic glucose output nor plasma glucose increased and each was not significantly different from values observed in control experiments (10.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 10.8 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg per min and 5.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.3 mM, respectively). We, therefore, conclude that in normal humans there is an autoregulatory process independent of changes in plasma glucose and glucoregulatory hormone concentrations which prevents a substrate-induced increase in gluconeogenesis from increasing overall hepatic glucose output; since this process cannot be explained on the basis of inhibition of gluconeogenesis from other substrates, it probably involves diminution of glycogenolysis. A defect in this process could explain at least in part the increased hepatic glucose output found in NIDDM.\r"

Some lines of P. falciparum invade neuraminidase-treated or glycophorin-deficient red blood cells poorly, or not at all, while other lines invade such cells at substantial rates. To explore the molecular basis of non-sialic acid dependent invasion, we selected parasite lines from a clone (Dd2) that initially exhibited low invasion of neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. After maintaining Dd2 for several cycles in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes, parasite lines were recovered that invaded both untreated and neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes at equivalently high rates (Dd2/NM). The change in phenotype was maintained after removal of selection pressure. Four subclones of Dd2 were isolated and each readily converted from sialic acid dependence to non-sialic acid dependence during continuous propagation in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. The neuraminidase-selected lines and the Dd2 clone demonstrated identical restriction fragment length polymorphism markers indicating that the Dd2 clone was not contaminated during the selection process. Parasite proteins that bound to neuraminidase-treated and untreated erythrocytes were indistinguishable among the parent Dd2 clone and the neuraminidase-selected lines. The ability of the Dd2 parasite to change its invasion requirements for erythrocyte sialic acid suggests a switch mechanism permitting invasion by alternative pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Escherichia coli ingested by PMN promptly stop growing and form no colonies in nutrient agar, but metabolize near normally for up to several hours. The bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) of PMN also inhibits E. coli growth without initial metabolic impairment. We recently showed that BPI-treated E. coli, although unable to grow in normal nutrient agar, can form colonies in this medium plus 0.1% BSA, as long as their metabolism is maintained, indicating that biochemical impairment is a better indicator of death than growth arrest (1990. J. Clin. Invest. 85:853-860). We have now reexamined the fate of ingested E. coli. Rabbit PMN ingest greater than 85% of several rough E. coli strains in 15 min, but greater than 80% of these bacteria, while unable to form colonies in conventional agar, grow normally on agar plus 0.1% BSA. Thus, the PMN under these conditions promptly stop growth of ingested E. coli without killing. Adding nonlethal concentrations of normal human serum (NHS) before, but not after ingestion, accelerates killing and, in parallel, loss of bacterial metabolism (t1/2 less than 0.5 h vs. greater than 3 h, respectively, with and without NHS). The rapid killing of both rough and smooth E. coli pretreated with NHS is lost after C7 depletion (C7-D) and restored when C7 is replenished. Similar results are obtained with human PMN. In contrast, ingested Staphylococcus epidermidis, opsonized with either NHS or C7-D serum rapidly stop metabolizing and do not form colonies in nutrient agar with or without BSA. Respiratory burst activity is the same during ingestion of E. coli (with or without NHS) and S. epidermidis. Killing of E. coli J5 (however, not of O111-B4) by BPI is also accelerated by pretreatment with NHS but not C7-D human serum. These findings indicate that late complement components are needed for efficient killing of both rough and smooth E. coli by PMN, and that BPI is the principal intracellular agent acting on ingested rough E. coli.\r"

In this study, kinetics of VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL apoprotein B and VLDL triglyceride were determined in seven nondiabetic (ND) and seven non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) Pima Indian subjects on high-fat and high-carbohydrate (HICHO) diets. Metabolic changes were similar in ND and NIDDM. On the HICHO diet, LDLC decreased (131 +/- 8 vs. 110 +/- 7 mg/dl, P less than 0.0001) in all subjects. Mean fasting and 24-h triglyceride (TG) concentrations were unchanged, as were mean production rates and fractional clearance rates (FCR) of VLDL apoB and VLDL TG. The mean VLDL apoB pool size (303 +/- 20 vs. 371 +/- 38 mg, P = 0.01) increased owing to a decrease in the mean transport rate (10.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.4 +/- 0.9 mg/kg fat-free mass (ffm) per day, P less than 0.0001) and the mean rate constant (2.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.2, P less than 0.001) for the VLDL apoB to IDL apoB conversion pathway. The mean transport rate of VLDL apoB to LDL apoB via IDL (10.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.0 +/- 0.8 mg/kg ffm per day, P less than 0.001) decreased. Mean LDL apoB concentrations decreased (70 +/- 5 vs. 61 +/- 5 mg/dl, P less than 0.001) on the HICHO diet. Means for total LDL apoB transport rate, LDL apoB FCR, and LDLC/apoB ratios were unchanged. In summary, the HICHO diet decreased the activity of mechanisms that convert VLDL to LDL, which contributed to the decrease in LDLC in all subjects. There was also evidence in some subjects for increased activity of LDL apoB clearance mechanisms, and a decrease in the LDLC to apoB ratio.\r"

Studies have not been done looking at changes in nonspecific BR in allergic children over time. Therefore, we report on our longitudinal study of BR in allergic children and adolescents. The reported subjects are part of a larger ongoing study in a selected population of families with asthma and of twins. Initiated in 1972, the subjects reported in this study are subjects who have had at least one follow-up visit through 1989 and did not have asthma, but had allergic histories at either their initial visit or follow-up visits. Subjects completed a questionnaire, had skin tests, determination of a serum IgE level, and a determination of nonspecific BR with a methacholine challenge. Subjects were 6 years of age or older or 21 years of age or younger at initial visit. Subjects from families with asthma (N = 76; mean age, 12.09 years; +/- 4.6 SD) and twins (N = 36; mean age, 11.81 years; +/- 3.81 SD) were followed longitudinally, and their age at follow-up visits was not restricted. In this study we observed that, of 106 subjects, 66% initially demonstrated nonspecific BR. At their first and second follow-up visits, 70.4% and 61.3% demonstrated persistence of their BR. These data demonstrate that allergic children and adolescents have increased nonspecific BR. There was not a significant loss of BR over time in the studied subjects.\r"

With a fixed-cell ELISA, we demonstrated that ANCAs occur in the serum of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involving the colon. In a blinded study, sera from 21 of 25 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and five of 25 patients with Crohn's disease had binding in the fixed-cell ELISA. The five reactive sera from patients with Crohn's disease were associated with the presence of clear colonic involvement. The presence of ANCA in patients with UC was not influenced by disease distribution or activity. Indeed, such antibodies were present in four subjects with UC more than 5 years after colectomy. The IBD-associated ANCAs were distinct from ANCAs reported in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis since the pattern of staining on indirect immunofluorescence exhibited a nongranular perinuclear distribution (P-ANCA). The P-ANCA observed in IBD did not react with myeloperoxidase and thus was distinct from the P-ANCA observed in vasculitis with cresentric glomerulonephritis. IBD and, in particular, UC, is associated with a distinct subset of P-ANCA, which may have important diagnostic and potential pathophysiologic implications.\r"

In a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study, 423 adult patients with moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis received placebo or fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray at doses of 25, 100, or 400 micrograms twice daily (b.i.d.) for 2 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated by nasal symptom scores, nasal airflow, nasal cytology, and global evaluation. All doses of fluticasone propionate were significantly better than placebo in reducing symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients receiving the largest dose of fluticasone propionate (400 micrograms b.i.d.) had a slightly greater reduction (not significant) in symptom scores than patients receiving the smallest dose (25 micrograms b.i.d.). Symptom improvement was evident within 3 days of treatment. Nasal airflow improved in the groups treated with fluticasone propionate, 100 and 400 micrograms b.i.d. Examination of nasal cytograms revealed a striking decrease in both eosinophils and basophils in all three groups receiving active treatment compared with placebo. There were few adverse events and no treatment-related abnormalities in laboratory assays or evaluations of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis function. Comparison of treatment groups indicated that fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray was as safe as placebo at the doses studied.\r"

  ".W": "CD27 mAb recognize a disulfide-linked homodimer of 55 kDa present in the majority of T cells and in a minor subpopulation of thymocytes. Although an increase of CD27 expression has been described in activated T cells, this Ag is poorly expressed in long term growing T cells. It has been also reported that CD27- becomes CD27+ upon activation. In the aim to better know the relationship between CD27 expression and the activation and maturation processes, the induction of this Ag in thymocytes was analyzed. The results obtained in this work show that: 1) CD27 is expressed only in thymocytes with high CD3 Ag density. 2) Its expression can be induced in low density CD3 CD4+ CD8+ cells by Con A and in low CD3 Ag density by PMA+ionomycin. 3) PMA alone or in combination with rIL-2 induces CD25 and CD71 expression but not CD27. 4) Unlike CD27, the Ag CD45RA, CD26, and CD76, which are present only in a minor thymocyte subpopulation, are not induced in double positive thymocytes. Because it has been reported that cyclosporin A interferes with thymocytes maturation and blocks the transition from double to single positive cells, its effect was measured on CD27 induction. Cyclosporin A did not inhibit CD25 expression induced by both Con A and PMA+ionomycin, but under these conditions it inhibited the induction of CD27. In this paper we discuss whether CD27 could be implicated in T cell maturation.\r"

Induction of aggregation by anti-CD14 mAb required Mg2+, occurred at an optimal temperature of 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, and exhibited a kinetics which differed from adhesion triggered by IFN-gamma and anti-CD43 mAb. Monocyte adhesion induced by anti-CD14 mAb required neither Fcy gamma R engagement nor cross-linking of CD14, because adhesion was induced by F(ab)'2 fragments, as well as by monovalent F(ab) fragments of anti-CD14 mAb. mAb to CD11a, CD18, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), but not antibodies to CD11b and CD11c, inhibited monocyte adhesion induced by CD14 engagement. These results indicate that CD14-dependent adhesion is mediated by lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1/ICAM-1 interactions. This was confirmed by the absence of aggregation in anti-CD14-stimulated cells from a patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency. Monocyte adhesion upon CD14 engagement was blocked by an inhibitor of protein kinases, sphingosine. This suggests that protein kinases play a role in the intracellular signaling pathway(s) which couple CD14 to lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1/ICAM-1.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral blood monocytes are important mediators of inflammation via the generation of various bioactive substances, including the recently isolated and cloned chemotactic peptide IL-8. Through cytokine networking, monocyte-derived cytokines are capable of inducing IL-8 expression from non-immune cells. IL-4, a B and T lymphocyte stimulatory factor, has recently been shown to inhibit monocyte/macrophage function, including the ability to suppress monocyte-generated cytokines. We describe the in vitro inhibition of IL-8 gene expression and synthesis from LPS, TNF, and IL-1 stimulated peripheral blood monocytes by IL-4. IL-4 suppressed IL-8 production from stimulated monocytes in a dose-dependent fashion, with partial suppression observed at IL-4 concentrations as low as 10 pg/ml. The IL-4-induced suppressive effects were observed even when IL-4 was administered 2 h post-LPS-stimulation. The IL-4-induced inhibition of IL-8 mRNA expression was dependent on protein synthesis, as the suppressive effects of IL-4 were significantly negated by the addition of cycloheximide. Our findings suggest that IL-4 may be an important endogenous regulator of inflammatory cell recruitment, and adds further support to the potential role of IL-4 as a down-regulator of monocyte immune function.\r"

  ".U": "90347200\r", 
  ".W": "The synthesis and intracellular expression of glycosphingolipids by mouse serosal mast cells (SMC) have been characterized by radiolabeling and TLC and by immunodetection in situ. Chromatographic analysis of purified glycosphingolipids from SMC intrinsically labeled with [14C]galactose and [14C]glucosamine hydrochloride revealed the predominant synthesis of only the simplest neutral glycosphingolipid and ganglioside, glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3, respectively. Intracellular indirect immunofluorescence staining of permeabilized SMC demonstrated the absence of the more complex neutral glycosphingolipids lactosylceramide, globotriosylceramide, globotetraosylceramide, and globopentaosylceramide, the absence of ganglioside GM1, and the presence of ganglioside GM3. By contrast, permeabilized mouse IL-3-dependent bone marrow culture-derived mast cells (BMMC) and mast cells recovered after 21 days of coculture of BMMC with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts expressed lactosylceramide, globotriosylceramide, globotetraosylceramide, ganglioside GM1, and ganglioside GM3, but not globopentaosylceramide intracellularly as determined by immunofluorescence. The findings indicate a loss of biosynthetic capacity and epitope maintenance for glycosphingolipids with in vivo differentiation of SMC from IL-3-dependent BMMC progenitors. Thus, although mast cells derived after coculture of these progenitors for 21 days with fibroblasts assume multiple SMC-like properties in terms of their histochemical staining and their secretory granule proteoglycan and neutral protease constituents, they do not lose the ability to express complex glycosphingolipids. The finding that glycosphingolipid composition does not change coordinately with other secretory granule markers defines a new stage of mouse mast cell development between the BMMC and SMC and provides evidence that mast cell development is more complex than previously appreciated.\r"

  ".U": "90347202\r", 
  ".W": "The mouse lymph node specific homing receptor gp90MEL-14 is a 95-kDa molecular mass ubiquitinated cell surface molecule involved in the binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules in peripheral lymph nodes. The molecule is thought to consist of a core protein to which ubiquitin side chains are covalently bound. Recently we cloned the cDNA encoding the core protein; this cDNA clone encodes for a polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 37 kDa. We have studied the biosynthesis of gp90MEL-14 in an effort to explain the difference in molecular mass between the core protein and the 95-kDa mature molecule. Pulse labeling experiments show a rapid synthesis of a 70-kDa precursor form that contains high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides. On processing of the high-mannose oligosaccharides into complex N-linked oligosaccharides, the precursor matures in a single step into the 95-kDa form. Experiments using deglycosylating enzymes and inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation demonstrate that the molecular mass of deglycosylated gp90MEL-14 is 45 kDa; extensive N-linked glycosylation is responsible for the difference in molecular mass with the mature 95-kDa form. The core protein molecular weight of in vitro transcribed and translated gp90MEL-14 cDNA is consistent with the estimated molecular mass of 37 kDa, calculated from the cDNA sequence of the core protein, and 8 to 10 kDa less than the protein molecular mass of gp90MEL-14 translated in vivo in the presence of tunicamycin (45 kDa). Inasmuch as we have ruled out glycosylation as accounting for this discrepancy, this is consistent with the addition of one ubiquitin moiety to the core protein during biosynthesis. Limited proteolysis confirms the similarity between in vitro transcribed gp90MEL-14 cDNA and the tunicamycin form of gp90MEL-14.\r"

  ".W": "Multicomponent synthetic vaccines containing both B and T cell epitopes belonging to two different pre-erythrocytic Ag of Plasmodium falciparum are presented. In a di-component hybrid, a circumsporozoite T cell epitope and a peptide representing a liver stage-specific Ag were connected to obtain a reciprocal reinforcement of helical potentials. In a tri-component hybrid, a sequence corresponding to the circumsporozoite repeat tetrapeptide (NPNA) was tandemly synthesized on the N-terminal end of the di-component hybrid. Both hybrid molecules were able to adopt a partial helical conformation in water as determined by circular dichroism studies. To analyze if the different components were immunologically functional in these vaccines, mich bearing genetic backgrounds known to respond or not to the individual components were immunized with the hybrids. The tri-hybrid peptide showed high immunogenic capacity as it elicited, in both H-2b and H-2k mice, high antibody responses against every separate individual sequence. Moreover, the antibodies induced by these conformationally restricted peptides were able to recognize the corresponding native proteins in the liver schizont and the sporozoite surface. H-2d mice, in which the immune response to the individual components was genetically restricted, did respond against the di-hybrid peptide. The tri-hybrid peptide, in which NPNA repeats were present, lacked this H-2d-priming capacity but it triggered antibody production in H-2d mice previously primed with the di-hybrid peptide. These results indicate that multivalent vaccines can provide positive (potentiating) effects by carefully combining structurally well defined epitopes; however, negative (suppressive) effects are also possible suggesting that selection of multivalent vaccine components will require testing of combined molecules to optimize specific immune responses and avoid undesirable effects which may result from negative molecular interactions.\r"

Surprisingly, the deletion of the first exon of the B2mb gene that is observed in other cell lines is not found in R8. Possible reasons for this observation are discussed.\r"

TIL were produced by culturing Thy-1-enriched single cell suspensions from a variety of murine tumors in exogenous IL-2 along with irradiated tumor cells and splenocytes. TIL were adoptively transferred i.v. to mice and such animals demonstrated a statistically significant degree of protection from a subsequent i.v. tumor challenge. This protection lasted up to 6 wk and occurred in the absence of exogenous IL-2 administration in vivo. Using congenic B6.PL Thy-1 alpha/CY mice we demonstrated directly that TIL can survive in vivo for up to 6 wk and that the adoptively transferred TIL were the source of the relative immunity to subsequent tumor challenge. We conclude that TIL contain cells with substantial functional longevity in vivo even in the absence of exogenous IL-2. These studies are relevant to ongoing clinical trials of TIL as a therapy for patients with advanced cancer.\r"

Because MC may serve as targets for the ingrowth of NE during embryogenesis, the purpose of the present study was to analyze the relationship between MC and NE during embryogenesis. Frozen tissue from whisker pads and backs of NMRI mouse embryos (12-17 d gestational age) were studied by double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) with a cytokeratin monoclonal antibody that recognizes MC and with a neurofilament anti-serum. Such an approach allowed the analysis of a large number of MC (up to 5000), thus yielding quantitative data. At day 12 of gestational age, no MC were observed by IIF. From day 13 to 17, the number of MC, as well as their association with NE, progressively increased. On day 13, only 57% of whisker pad MC were NE associated, whereas by day 17, 95% were NE associated. These results were confirmed by electron microscopic (EM) observations. On the back, the same chronologic relationship between MC and NE was observed, but was later in the course of embryogenesis. There was also a time- and zone-dependent increase in MC association with NE in the epidermal zones studied (isthmic, parafollicular, interfollicular). These observations 1) establish the time course of MC and NE contacts during embryogenesis in the mouse epidermis, 2) show that MC are present in the epidermis and appendages before NE reach the epithelium, and 3) support the hypothesis that MC could act as targets for the growing NE.\r"

The lambda gt11 cDNA expression library was constructed from poly(A)+RNA from the mouse epidermal cell line, Pam cells, by random priming. 1.5 X 10(5) recombinant clones were screened by immunostaining with MoAb-5E and one positive clone (BPM1) was obtained. All of the ten BP sera but none of the five normal or seven pemphigus sera tested reacted with the fusion protein produced by BPM1. The size of the cDNA was 3.2 kb. Northern blot analysis indicated that BPM1 cDNA hybridized to a mRNA of about 9 kb, which is large enough to encode for a 230-kD protein. DNA sequencing demonstrated a 2,991-bp open reading frame encoding a peptide of 115 kD. Sequence comparison between mouse and human cDNA clones revealed that the 230-kD BP antigen was well conserved during evolution except for the carboxyl terminus. Highly conserved and hydrophilic regions in the molecule were considered to be good candidates for antigenic determinants. This cDNA clone will be useful not only for diagnosis of BP, e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides as antigens, but also for pathophysiologic study in which mouse models of BP might be used.\r"

To determine the effects of granulocyte macrophage--colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1) on LC phenotype in vitro, epidermal cell suspensions were enriched for LC by density-gradient centrifugation and cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml of these cytokines. The percentage of cells expressing the surface protein CD1a was determined by flow cytometry. This percentage typically dropped after 48 h culture in both control and cytokine-treated medium to less than half that of the starting value. By the fifth day, the percentage of cells expressing CD1a in TNF-alpha and IL-1--treated cultures was still near half of the starting value, slightly above that of control cultures. Treatment with GM-CSF caused large and consistent decreases in the percentage of epidermal cells expressing CD1a. Cell viability in each of the three cytokine-treated cultures was identical to the control cultures, with essentially all cells having died by the sixth day after isolation. To determine the functional effects of these cytokines, the cytokine-containing medium was replaced after 72 h with medium containing purified allogeneic T cells and proliferation measured. Preliminary experiments showed no increased proliferation induced by IL-1 or TNF-alpha--treated epidermal cells. GM-CSF-treated epidermal cells induced 2-3 times more T-cell proliferation than epidermal cells cultured without additional cytokines. We conclude that GM-CSF, a cytokine known to be produced by keratinocytes in vitro, decreases CD1a expression by human LC and increases their ability to stimulate proliferation by allogeneic T cells.\r"

Although deafness is recognised as being associated with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) only very rarely does it herald the disease. We describe a case of bilateral, sudden onset vestibulo-cochlear failure which with thorough investigation proved to be the presenting complaint of PAN. This diagnosis enabled definitive management of a multi-system disorder and resulted in an improvement of the initial symptom with the chemotherapeutic regime discussed. We review the involvement of PAN in deafness and hope this case will remind otolaryngologists of the need for full investigation of the above mentioned emergency, in an attempt to discover and hence direct management towards a specific underlying pathology.\r"

In total 122 individuals participated. The average tobacco consumption by smokers was 13 g d-1 for 59 years. In the CVD group 45% of subjects had atherosclerotic symptoms at more than one site. Smoking was found to be correlated with lower extremity atherosclerosis, cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were correlated with carotid artery lesions and pathological ankle/arm index, and blood pressure was correlated with lower extremity lesions. In contrast with middle-aged populations, individuals with an increasing degree of lesions in the lower extremities had a larger percentage of high glutathione transferase activity than subjects without CVD. Smokers had significantly lower pyridoxal-5-phosphate levels than non-smokers. It is concluded that some heavy smokers might reach an advanced age in good health. Smoking was also operative as a risk indicator for lower extremity atherosclerosis in 80-year-old individuals.\r"

Insulin was infused at a rate of 40 mU m-2 min-1 (n = 9) and 20 mU m-2 min-1 (n = 9). Hepatic glucose production was estimated with tritiated glucose in six subjects. The fasting glucose level at the first examination, 5.1 +/- 0.2 mmol l-1, exceeded that found at the second examination, 4.7 +/- 0.1 mmol l-1 (P less than 0.05), although the C-peptide concentration was higher at the first examination (2.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 ng ml-1; P less than 0.001). Both glucose uptake (5.0 +/- 0.6 vs 6.2 +/- 0.7 mg kg-1 min-1; P less than 0.05) and tissue sensitivity (M/I; 0.08 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.02 mg kg-1 min-1/mU l-1; P less than 0.05) increased between the first and second euglycaemic clamp (40 mU m-2 min-1). At the low insulin infusion rate (20 mU m-2 min-1), the tissue sensitivity to insulin increased (0.09 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.02 mg kg-1 min-1/mU l-1; P less than 0.05). Hepatic glucose production did not change during the examination period (2.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.1 mg kg-1 min-1), neither was there a change in the suppression of hepatic glucose output during hyperinsulinaemia (40 mU m-2 min-1). Our findings indicate that, in non-diabetic alcoholics, insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues is decreased during the early part of a withdrawal period.\r"

These factors are age dependent and so are CHD and atherosclerosis. The importance of hypercholesterolemia in atherogenesis is suspect particularly since the vascular pathology of familial hypercholesterolemia and of cholesterol-fed animals has been misrepresented and does not provide support for the role of hypercholesterolemia in atherogenesis.\r"

To determine the ability of written case simulations to predict actual clinical behavior, we applied methodologic criteria to published articles that used written simulations. Only 11 (15%) of 74 articles included an assessment of the criterion validity of their written case simulations. Only 2 of those 11 studies were designed and executed in such a way that criterion validity could be fully interpreted. No clear consensus emerged from an examination on the 11 studies on how well responses to written case simulations perform as proxy measures of actual behavior. More work is needed before assuming that written case simulations measure actual behavior.\r"

Vilhelm Magnus (1871-1929), born in the United States in Fillmore County, Minnesota, was Norway's pioneering neurosurgeon. Following graduation in Oslo, he started his clinical training in neurology and became an early member of the small group of neurologists of the time who were dissatisfied with the therapeutic nihilism generally accepted in relation to diseases of the nervous system. After working with Victor Horsley, whom he held in high esteem. Magnus devoted himself to surgically treatable lesions in the nervous system. During a quarter of a century he single-handedly established the special field of neurological surgery in Norway. Magnus was a far-seeing and brilliant surgeon with a broad intellectual mind, a startling diligence, and wide research activities. He published his first scientific paper in 1899 and his total contribution to the literature amounted to 70 papers. In 1901 he was able to demonstrate the importance of the corpus luteum in the first 3 weeks of pregnancy. As early as 1903 Magnus manifested his interest in the surgical treatment of brain tumors. In 1926 his surgical material comprised 216 patients, with an 8% operative mortality rate among 161 cases of supratentorial tumor versus 17% for 55 cases of infratentorial tumors, including 14 cases of acoustic tumor. Vilhelm Magnus, who visited Harvey Cushing in 1928, has hitherto not been given the attention he merits.\r"

Earlier reports are included because they are repeatedly referenced in current works and clearly are an important basis upon which present attitudes are predicated. Because recent work has definitively demonstrated the significance of prognostic variables on outcome, the handling of such factors in studies that investigated survival data according to degree of surgery is emphasized. Study design, experimental methods used, and methods of data analysis are also examined. This analysis shows that there is little justification for dogmatic statements concerning the relationship between increasing patient survival times and aggressive surgical management in adults with supratentorial intermediate or high-grade astrocytomas, if patients receive postoperative radiotherapy.\r"

A modified background subtraction algorithm was developed and compared to standard background subtraction in 16 patients who had both exercise-delayed 201Tl and exercise-rest 99mTc-Sestamibi imaging. Furthermore, a new normal data base was generated. Normal 99mTc-Sestamibi distribution was slightly different compared to 201Tl. Using standard background subtraction, mean defect reversibility was significantly underestimated by 99mTc-Sestamibi compared to 201Tl (2.8 +/- 4.9 versus -1.8 +/- 8.4, p less than 0.05). Using the modified background subtraction, mean defect reversibility on 201Tl and 99mTc-Sestamibi images was comparable (2.8 +/- 4.9 versus 1.7 +/- 5.2, p = NS). We conclude, that for quantification of 99mTc-Sestamibi images a new normal data base, as well as a modification of the interpolative background subtraction method should be employed to obtain quantitative results comparable to those with 201Tl.\r"

One hybrid protein binds HIV envelope protein gp160 and neutralizes the virus in vitro. This provides the first example of the production and one-step purification of an active form of an eukaryotic protein by fusion to MalE.

One patient randomized to the 800 mg group had Kaposi's sarcoma at study entry and was included in the intent-to-treat analysis. An overall significant difference in progression to AIDS was observed among the three treatment groups (p = 0.028) with patients randomized to receive 800 mg having a significantly longer time to AIDS than placebo patients (p = 0.012; relative risk, 9.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 70.8). There was no significant difference between the 600 mg and placebo groups (p = 0.15; relative risk, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 7.6). Baseline CD4 cell count and hematocrit made independent contributions and formed a multivariate prognostic set for these progression data. The significant treatment superiority of 800 mg compared to placebo remained after adjustment for these factors (p = 0.019). After deletion of patients with major protocol violations at entry, the difference between the 800 mg and placebo treatment remained significant (p = 0.021).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The [3H]U-69,593 site has a binding selectivity profile that corresponds to that of the kappa opiate receptor. That is, all kappa compounds, regardless of chemical class, and dynorphin A, the putative endogenous ligand for kappa receptors, bind to the site with high affinities, whereas mu and delta ligands and nonopiate compounds do not. The agonists U-69,593, ICI 197,067 and U-50,488 and antagonist nor-binaltorphimine were found to have a useful degree of selectivity for the site. The [3H]EKC site has opiate receptor characteristics and appears to be the most abundant opiate receptor in rat brain, but its binding selectivity profile is not that of a kappa receptor. Instead, this non-mu, non-delta, non-kappa site has the pharmacological properties that correspond to those of the beta-endorphin-specific, epsilon receptor that has been hypothesized to exist for some time. We could not identify any compound that is selective for the putative epsilon site. Of the more than 50 compounds tested, all were either equally potent at the [3H]U-69,593 and [3H]EKC sites or were more potent at the [3H]U-69,593 site.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the selective dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonists, SKF 38393 and N-0437, respectively, on the firing rate of medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons were studied in young (3-5 months old), and aged (18 and 26 months old) Fischer 344 rats. Multibarrel glass micropipettes, filled with 1 mM SKF 38393 and N-0437, were lowered into the anteromedial cortical target area (PFC) of the mesocortical dopamine system in urethane-anesthetized animals. The drug solutions were locally applied by pressure ejection. In young rats, both agonists produced dose-dependent and reversible reductions in firing rates. However, the D2 agonist was approximately 10 times more potent than the D1 agonist in suppressing firing rate. Even at the highest doses, SKF 38393 rarely produced complete cessation of firing in PFC cells. Moreover, no evidence of synergism was observed when the two drugs were simultaneously applied. PFC neurons in aged rats were significantly subsensitive to locally applied SKF 38393, whereas no change in sensitivity to N-0437 was observed. These results suggest that both D1 and D2 receptors are present in the PFC and that agonist occupancy of each of these receptors elicits an inhibition of PFC neuron discharge; furthermore, these data suggest an age-related change in D1 dopamine receptor-mediated processes with no concomitant change in processes linked to the activation of D2 dopamine processes.\r"

In the present studies, the specific opioid receptor subtype(s) which may be activated by such an endogenous innervation were examined using local administration of selective antagonists. The RVLM pressor region of chloralose-anesthetized and artificially ventilated rabbits was functionally identified by local administration of L-glutamate (5 nmol). Selective blockade of neither mu nor kappa receptors in the RVLM after bilateral injections of beta-funaltrexamine (300-900 pmol) or nor-binaltorphimine (1 nmol), respectively, had any effect on either mean arterial pressure or heart rate. Delta receptors were blocked with ICI 174,864 (30-300 pmol). After the highest dose, there was a significant pressor effect (+32 +/- 6 mm Hg, mean +/- S.E.), which was of immediate onset and rapid time course (approximately 15 min), and which was accompanied by a bradycardia. In contrast, vehicle injections or injection of an inactive analog (ICI 178,173) had no effects. These results, together with previous pharmacological and anatomical evidence, suggest that there exists an enkephalinergic input to the RVLM that tonically inhibits the presympathetic pressor neurons via activation of delta-opioid receptors.\r"

Thus, the relationship between myocardial ischemia and chest pain is variable in that many patients experience pain without ischemia and many others exhibit ischemia without pain-termed \"silent\" or \"asymptomatic ischemia.\" Although the nature of the ischemic event may be important in determining the degree of associated pain, we suggest more study of the individual who perceives the event. Myocardial ischemia may not generate a spontaneous report of chest pain because the patient is generally hyposensitive to visceral sensation; because he or she is coping with the threat of heart disease by denying the evidence of it--ie, denying the pain to deny the disease; or because the patient misunderstands the cause and significance of a vague or ambiguous cardiac sensation, normalizing the symptom and misattributing it to a nonpathologic cause.\r"

We noted hand deformities characteristic of inflammatory arthritis in Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot's Gipsy Girl With Mandolin (1870 to 1875), National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. Corot suffered with what probably was gout beginning in 1866. We are unaware that arthritis has been observed in Corot's subjects or that Corot's depiction of arthritis has been appreciated from the perspective of his own rheumatic disease. Examination of other Corot portraits identifies some with blurred hand details consistent with the artist's style and the remainder with normal hands. These observations suggest that the artist portrayed specific anatomic abnormalities in the \"Gipsy Girl's\" hand, indicating familiarity with inflammatory arthritis. It is speculative whether this was Corot's own or the model's arthritis; we favor the interpretation that Corot's gout was reflected in this particular work. We thus add a new perspective to Corot's Gipsy Girl With Mandolin-a subject with arthritis, a painter knowledgeable about arthritis, and a painting that therefore might be understood at least in part from an appreciation of the artist's specific illness.\r"

Treatments with placebo or BNZ were assigned randomly. A wide range of proteinuria lowering effect was observed in overall population (from 1 to 84%, average 34%). Following the arbitrary level of a 30% reduction, two well-matched subgroups (10 patients for each one) were obtained: \"good responders\" (average decrease 51%), and \"poor responders\" (average decrease 17%). The main distinctive feature between the two groups was a higher plasma renin activity level in good than in poor responders. A positive correlation between the fall in proteinuria and blood pressure was found. Although the decrease in blood pressure seems to represent the major factor in determining the reduction in proteinuria, a multiple correlation analysis showed that the most prominent role (71%) was attributable to the combined decrease in blood pressure and filtration fraction, and then also to the efferent arteriole dilatation. Our conclusion is that ACE inhibitors are capable of also reducing proteinuria in patients with renal disease with normal blood pressure, the effect being more pronounced in those exhibiting humoral, systemic and renal hemodynamic patterns, indicating a greater activity of circulating and renal renin angiotensin system.\r"

Production of SCC-related antigen (SCCRA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the serum of tumor-bearing mice was observed. To evaluate the usefulness of SCCRA for esophageal cancer, the relationship between the serum levels of SCCRA and tumor burden in athymic nude mice bearing IMEs-1 was studied. The mean serum levels of SCCRA, as determined by radioimmunoassay, gradually rose in direct proportion to the tumor growth gauged by tumor volume. However, the serum levels of CEA did not increase until the last few weeks of the assay. These results suggest the possibility of using SCCRA as a tumor marker for esophageal SCC. In addition, this nude mouse assay system will provide a theoretical model to study the usefulness of SCCRA.\r"

Increased size and lack of gross circumscription of the neoplasm and presentation in the adult age group appear to identify cases with an increased risk of disease progression.

All patients received the last dose of their usual beta-adrenergic blocker the night before the operation and were anesthetized with midazolam, vecuronium, and enflurane in oxygen. Treatment criteria were either a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg and a heart rate greater than 70 or a heart rate greater than 80 beats/min. In phase I, graduated doses of esmolol were given to successive patients. A dose of 80 mg followed by a 12 mg/min infusion was declared effective. Phase II patients were randomized to receive esmolol (n = 16) or placebo (n = 14). Hemodynamic data were collected at baseline and 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after the administration of esmolol. Plasma norepinephrine was measured at baseline, 1, and 10 minutes. Esmolol significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced heart rate at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes but did not change blood pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, right atrial pressure, cardiac output, or systemic vascular resistance. Our results show that a bolus loading dose of esmolol is safe and effective in the treatment of tachycardia in patients with ischemic heart disease and that esmolol rapidly blocks the beta-adrenergic effects of norepinephrine associated with surgical stress.\r"

Of 1019 adult patients undergoing cardiac operations during a 14-month period, a diagnosis of postpericardiotomy syndrome was made in 187, and 149 were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis was based on the presence of at least two of the following: fever, anterior chest pain, and friction rub. Drug efficacy was defined as the resolution of at least two of these criteria within 48 hours of drug initiation. Ibuprofen and indomethacin were 90.2% and 88.7% effective, respectively, and both were significantly more effective than placebo (62.5%, p = 0.003). The occurrence of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, renal failure, and fluid retention, was low in all groups (13.1% for ibuprofen, 16.1% for indomethacin, and 16.7% for placebo [p = not significant). Length of hospital stay, incidence of ischemic events, and accumulation of significant pericardial effusions were similar in all groups. The results of this study demonstrate that both ibuprofen and indomethacin provide safe and effective symptomatic treatment for postpericardiotomy syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In 1987, a cooperative study group consisting of five institutions was formed to determine the relative benefits of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endorectal (transrectal) ultrasonography in evaluating patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (stage Ta or Tb). METHODS. Over a period of 15 months, 230 patients were entered into the study and evaluated with identical imaging techniques. We compared imaging results with information obtained at the time of surgery and on pathological analysis. RESULTS. MRI correctly staged 77 percent of cases of advanced disease and 57 percent of cases of localized disease; the corresponding figures for ultrasonography were 66 and 46 percent (P not significant). These figures did not vary significantly between readers; moreover, simultaneous interpretation of MRI and ultrasound scans did not improve accuracy. In terms of detecting and localizing lesions, MRI identified only 60 percent of all malignant tumors measuring more than 5 mm on pathological analysis and ultrasonography identified only 59 percent. CONCLUSIONS. The MRI and ultrasonography equipment that is currently available is not highly accurate in staging early prostate cancer, mainly because neither technique has the ability to identify microscopic spread of disease. Further evaluation with improved equipment may improve the accuracy of these techniques.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. It is controversial whether treatment with corticosteroids reduces stricture formation in the esophagus after the ingestion of caustic material. METHODS. We conducted a prospective study over an 18-year period in which 60 children (median age, 2 years) with esophageal injury from the ingestion of caustic material were assigned randomly to treatment either with or without corticosteroids. The corticosteroids were given initially as prednisolon (2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day intravenously) and then as prednisone orally to complete a three-week course. All patients were evaluated by esophagoscopy within 24 hours of the ingestion. Those with moderate or severe esophageal injury had repeat esophagoscopy and barium swallow at follow-up. RESULTS. Esophageal strictures developed in 10 of the 31 children treated with corticosteroids and in 11 of the 29 controls (P not significant). Four children in the steroid group and seven in the control group eventually required esophageal replacement (P not significant). All but 1 of the 21 children with strictures had severe circumferential burns on initial esophagoscopy. CONCLUSIONS. There appears to be no benefit from the use of steroids to treat children who have ingested a caustic substance. The development of esophageal stricture was related only to the severity of the corrosive injury.\r"

  ".W": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed anxiolytics and anticonvulsants which bind with high affinity to sites on the GABAA receptor/Cl- channel complex and potentiate the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). The heterogeneity of benzodiazepine recognition sites in the central nervous system was revealed by studies showing different classes of GABAA receptor subunits (classes alpha, beta and gamma) and variant subunits in these classes, particularly in the alpha-class. Expression of recombinant subunits produces functional receptors; when certain alpha-variants are coexpressed with beta- and gamma-subunits the resulting receptors have pharmacological properties characteristic of GABAA-benzodiazepine type I or type II receptors. The alpha-variants are differentially expressed in the central nervous system and can be photoaffinity-labelled with benzodiazepines. Here we report a novel alpha-subunit (alpha 6) of cerebellar granule cells. We show that recombinant receptors composed of alpha 6, beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits bind with high affinity to the GABA agonist [3H]muscimol and the benzodiazepine [3H]Ro15-4513 but not the other benzodiazepines or beta-carboniles. The same distinctive pharmacology is observed with GABAA receptors from rat cerebellum immunoprecipitated by an antiserum specific for the alpha 6 subunit. We conclude that this alpha-subunit is part of a cerebellar receptor subtype, selective for Ro15-4513, an antagonist of alcohol-induced motor incoordination and ataxia.\r"

No consensus exists as to what extent class II molecules themselves are endocytosed and it is not known whether endocytosed MHC class II molecules can be recycled again to the cell surface--an itinerary which might allow a single cell-surface MHC molecule to associate with different peptides during its lifetime. We now show by using new cleavable labelling reagents that class II and class I MHC on B lymphoblastoid cells are continually endocytosed and recycled to the cell surface. The intracellular pool size is normally kept small by efficient recycling, but in the presence of primaquine the rate of recycling is slowed, thereby increasing the size of this pool substantially. On removal of the amine, the intracellular population recycles rapidly to restore the original distribution. These results reveal a cycle that might explain the rapid binding and turnover of some peptide/class II MHC complexes and the exchange of pre-existing for new peptides observed in living cells.\r"

  ".W": "Histone gene expression is regulated both during and after transcription, with the turnover of histone messenger RNA and the regulation of its 3' processing being the principal factors that determine the size of the histone mRNA pool during the cell cycle. The mature ends of the replication-dependent histone mRNAs are generated during 3' processing by endonucleolytic cleavage of a large primary transcript. This reaction depends on a highly conserved stem-loop structure also included in the mature RNA, and a purine-rich sequence lying downstream within the spacer transcript. Three factors involved in this reaction which act in trans have been identified: the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), the heat-labile factor, and the hairpin-binding factor. Here we show how U7 snRNP participates in the regulation of 3' processing: the 5' sequences of the U7 snRNA that hybridize with the downstream spacer motif during 3' processing are occluded in the G0 stage of the cell cycle but are exposed and free to interact with histone pre-mRNA during S phase, when histone mRNA synthesis is at its peak.\r"

  ".U": "90348973\r", 
  ".W": "Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium swim by rotating their flagella, each of which consists of an external helical filament and a rotary motor embedded in the cell surface. The function of the flagellar motor has been examined mainly by tethering the flagellar filament to a glass slide and observing the resultant rotation of the cell body. But under these conditions the motor operates at a very low speed (about 10 r.p.s.) owing to the unnaturally high load conditions inherent in this technique. Lowe et al. analysed the frequency of light scattered from swimming cells to estimate the average rotation speed of flagellar bundles of E. coli as about 270 r.p.s. To analyse motor function in more detail, however, measurement of high-speed rotation of a single flagellum (at low load) with a temporal resolution better than 1 ms is needed. We have now developed a new method--laser dark-field microscopy--which fulfils these requirements. We find that although the average rotation speed of S. typhimurium flagella is rather stable, there are occasional abrupt slowdowns, pauses and reversals (accomplished within 1 ms). These changes were frequently observed in mutants defective in one of the motor components (called the switch complex), suggesting that this component is important not only in switching rotational direction but also in torque generation or regulation.\r"

Previous methods have utilized ventriculogram-guided stereotaxis requiring indirect cingulate gyrus localization and general anesthesia. With the present technique a BRW stereotactic frame was applied with the patient under local anesthesia. An MRI scan was performed using a T1 signal (TR, 600 ms; TE, 30 ms) in the coronal plane with 5-mm thick sections spaced every 6 mm. The coronal slice 24 mm posterior to the anterior tip of lateral ventricle was identified. The center of each (right and left) cingulate gyrus was identified as a target area, and appropriate coordinates were determined. Approach parameters were calculated for the right and left gyri using an azimuth of 45 degrees and 315 degrees, respectively, and a declination of 45 degrees. A radiofrequency electrode was stereotactically placed so that the electrode tip was at a target point which was the center of the cingulate gyrus. A radiofrequency lesion (75 degrees, 60 seconds) was made in each hemisphere's cingulate gyrus. Four patients with intractable terminal cancer pain have been initially treated in this manner. The lesions were well-localized on postoperative MRI scans. There have been no complications except for perilesional edema for 10 days in 1 patient (treated with longer radiofrequency settings that have subsequently been modified).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight months later, another operation was necessary for an intramedullary neoplasm at C3-T4. This latter tumor consisted of small, poorly developed cells, large atypical astrocytes, and ependymal cells. Neither ependymal rosettes nor papillary formations were present. Ultrastructural studies showed some features of ependymal differentiation of the large \"astrocytic\" cells.

The stereotactically inserted guiding tube acts in the place of brain retractors to expose deep-seated pathological lesions, which are then visualized by means of a fine endoscope. The lesions may then be treated by various microsurgical techniques such as laser vaporization. Fifteen intra-axial lesions were operated on by this method using a guiding tube of 8 mm in outer diameter without significant complications. Seven small lesions measuring 3 to 26 mm in maximal diameter were resected totally. Eight large lesions, including two highly vascularized tumors, were examined by biopsy and resected partially through a burr hole with complete hemostasis under direct vision. This system is particularly useful for removing small intra-axial tumors in deep or eloquent areas difficult to resect using ordinary surgical techniques. It will also be applicable for other stereotactic operations that require accuracy and minimum invasiveness with complete hemostasis under direct visualization.\r"

Runs of 9 and 10 identical base pairs and a direct repeat of 110 base pairs were mutational hotspots. In addition, two copies of a provirus contained 15 G-to-A substitutions. Such proviruses, which we name hypermutants, may arise through the action of an error-prone polymerase and could significantly contribute to the genetic variation in retroviral populations.\r"

The DNA thermodynamic binding domain, defined by primer extension analysis, spans at least 18 base pairs, a site much larger than the 9-base-pair consensus defined by homology with naturally occurring binding sites. Chemical modification experiments reveal multiple sites of protein-DNA contact: methylation of any guanine N-7 or adenine N-3, ethylation of any phosphate oxygen, or elimination of any nucleoside within a region spanning nearly one and a half turns of the double helix reduces the binding affinity of the complex measurably. Nevertheless, the protein yields no detectable hydroxyl radical footprint, implying that the minor groove is reagent-accessible in the protein-DNA complex. These chemical modification patterns indicate that GCN4 does not utilize any of the DNA-recognition motifs of paradigm DNA-binding proteins. Assays to detect DNA bending induced by truncated or intact GCN4 indicate that protein conformation and not a protein-induced bend is responsible for the anomalous electrophoretic behavior of GCN4-DNA complexes.\r"

To determine the mechanism of this interaction we have used a vaccinia virus/bacteriophage T7-based transient gene expression system to induce production of normal and kinase-deficient forms of p185 in the absence and presence of EGF receptors. Tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-deficient p185 was observed, but only in the presence of the EGF receptor. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that p185 is a substrate for the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase in a tyrosine kinase cascade.\r"

We report the construction of vectors bearing a single cisDDP[d(ApG)] lesion and their use in mutagenesis experiments in Escherichia coli. The mutagenic processing of the lesion is found to depend strictly on induction of the SOS system of the bacterial host cells. In SOS-induced cells, mutation frequencies of 1-2% were detected. All these mutations are targeted to the 5' base of the adduct. Single A----T transversions are mainly observed (80%), whereas A----G transitions account for 10% of the total mutations. Tandem base-pair substitutions involving the adenine residue and the thymine residue immediately 5' to the adduct occur at a comparable frequency (10%). No selective loss of the strand bearing the platinum adduct was seen, suggesting that, in vivo, cisDDP[d(ApG)] adducts are not blocking lesions.

The ability of the mutant cells to convert labeled hexadecanol to the corresponding fatty acid in vivo was reduced to 5% of the parent strain. Whole-cell homogenates from the mutant strain, FAA.1, were deficient in long-chain fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase (FAO; EC 1.1.1.192) activity, which catalyzes the oxidation of hexadecanol to hexadecanoic acid, although the intermediate fatty aldehyde was formed normally. A direct measurement of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase showed that the FAA.1 strain was defective in this component of FAO activity. FAA.1 is a two-stage mutant that was selected from a previously described parent strain, ZR-82, which is defective in ether lipid biosynthesis and peroxisome assembly. Because of combined defects in ether lipid biosynthesis and fatty alcohol oxidation, the ability of the FAA.1 cells to incorporate hexadecanol into complex lipids was greatly impaired, resulting in a 60-fold increase in cellular fatty alcohol levels. As the FAO deficiency in FAA.1 cells appears to be identical to the defect associated with the human genetic disorder Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, the FAA.1 cell line may be useful in studying this disease.\r"

The pM47 plasmid was introduced into T98G cells derived from a human glioblastoma multiforme tumor, and a stable clonal cell line, GM47.23, was derived that conditionally expressed wt-p53 following exposure to dexamethasone. We show that induction of wt-p53 expression in exponentially growing cells inhibits cell cycle progression and that the inhibitory effect is reversible upon removal of the inducer or infection with simian virus 40. Moreover, when growth-arrested cells are stimulated to proliferate, induction of wt-p53 expression inhibits G0/G1 progression into S phase and the cells accumulate with a DNA content equivalent to cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, these studies suggest that wt-p53 may play a negative role in growth regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Escherichia coli responds to superoxide-generating agents by inducing approximately 40 proteins. We have identified a genetic locus, soxR (superoxide response), that positively regulates 9 of these proteins during superoxide stress. Induction under soxR control is at the transcriptional level, as shown with lac fusions to five paraquat-inducible promoters. Members of the soxR regulon include at least three proteins with demonstrable antioxidant roles: Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (which destroys superoxide radicals), endonuclease IV (which repairs radical-induced damages in DNA), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (which produces NADPH). Induction of the soxR regulon also leads to diminished levels of the major outer membrane protein OmpF and alteration of the small-subunit ribosomal protein S6. These latter changes confer resistance to a variety of antibiotics. The soxR regulon may thus operate as an inducible defense against xenobiotics in general.\r"

  ".W": "Intranasal inoculation of type 5 adenovirus into the cotton rat Sigmodon hispidus produces a pneumonia pathologically similar to that in humans, and it, therefore, provides an excellent animal model to investigate the pathogenesis of this disease. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that accumulation of viral structural proteins is responsible for a major portion of the cell-damage-producing disease. Since viral DNA replication is essential for synthesis of the viral structural proteins, which are products of late genes, the hypothesis was tested using mutants defective in genes required for DNA synthesis. Most experiments were done with the conditionally lethal temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant H5ts125, which contains a mutation in the early region 2A (E2A) gene encoding the DNA-binding protein. The data show that infection with 1 x 10(9.0) plaque-forming units of H5ts125 induced a pneumonia that was as extensive and qualitatively the same as that after wild-type adenovirus type 5 infection, although H5ts125 did not replicate to produce infectious virus. When cotton rats were infected with 1 x 10(8.0) plaque-forming units of wild-type adenovirus type 5 or H5ts125, the pneumonias that followed were pathologically similar; in the latter phases, however, wild-type virus produced slightly more extensive pneumonia than did H5ts125, probably because its replication permitted infection of more susceptible cells.\r"

  ".W": "A procedure for mapping small DNA probes directly on banded human chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization has been developed. This procedure allows for the simultaneous visualization of banded chromosomes and hybridization signal without overlaying two separate photographic images. This method is simple and rapid, requires only a typical fluorescence microscope, has proven successful with DNA probes as small as 1 kilobase, is applicable for larger probes, and will greatly facilitate mapping the vast number of probes being generated to study genetic disease and define the human genome. Human metaphase chromosomes were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocyte cultures synchronized with bromodeoxyuridine and thymidine. Probes were labeled with biotin-dUTP, and the hybridization signal was amplified by immunofluorescence. Chromosomes were stained with both propidium iodide and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), producing R- and Q-banding patterns, respectively, allowing unambiguous chromosome and band identification while simultaneously visualizing the hybridization signal. Thirteen unique DNA segments have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 11 by using this technique, and localization of 10 additional probes by using radioactive in situ hybridization provides a comparison between the two procedures. These DNA segments have been mapped to all long-arm bands on chromosome 11 and in regions associated with neoplasias and inherited disorders.\r"

Asolectin liposomes in which the toxin was incorporated were also examined. Excised inside-out patches from these preparations often revealed at 118 pS conductance appearing in pairs. The current through this conductance flickered rapidly among three states: dwelling mostly at the unit-open state, less frequently at the two-unit-open state, and more rarely at the closed state. Membrane voltages from -80 to 80 mV had little influence on the opening probability. The current reversed near the equilibrium potential of K+ in asymmetric KCl solutions and also reversed near O mV at symmetric NaCl vs. KCl solutions. The two levels of the conductance were likely due to the toxin protein, as treatment of spheroplasts or liposomes with extracellular protein preparations from isogenic yeasts deleted for the toxin gene gave no such conductance levels. These results show that in vivo the killer-toxin fraction can form a cation channel that seldom closes regardless of membrane voltage. We suggest that this channel causes the death of sensitive yeast cells.\r"

This protein has likewise been implicated in commitment to meiotic DNA recombination and induced mutagenesis, which may result from error-prone DNA repair. Our previous work revealed sequence similarity between the Cdc7 protein and known protein kinases. To determine whether it possesses kinase activity, we have immunoprecipitated the protein from Cdc7-overproducing yeast cells by using polyclonal antibodies raised against a nondenatured beta-galactosidase-Cdc7 fusion protein. In this report, we demonstrate that Cdc7 immune complexes are capable of phosphorylating mammalian histone H1 on serine and/or threonine residues. Immune complexes derived from cells harboring the cdc7-2 ts mutant gene on a high copy number plasmid possess a thermolabile kinase activity. Thus, we postulate that Cdc7 may regulate the various DNA metabolic pathways by phosphorylating one or more target substrates. Because Cdc7 kinase acts downstream of Cdc28/cdc2 kinase function at \"start,\" the transition from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle may be the result of a cascade of protein phosphorylation.\r"

  ".U": "90349600\r", 
  ".W": "Repression of transcription from the silent mating loci (HML alpha and HMRa) is essential for mating ability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This silencing is known to require at least five proteins (SIR1, SIR2, SIR3, SIR4, and histone H4) and is accompanied by a change in chromatin structure. We show here that four positions of histone H4 (N-terminal residues 16, 17, 18, and 19) are crucial to silencing. HML alpha and HMRa are efficiently repressed when these positions are occupied by basic amino acids but are derepressed when substituted with glycine. These results suggest that acetylation of Lys-16 would lead to derepression of the silent mating loci. Three strong extragenic suppressors of the latter H4 mutations were isolated and determined to be located in SIR3. These suppressors allow high mating efficiencies in cells expressing either wild-type H4 or H4 containing single amino acid substitutions. They did not allow efficient mating in a strain that contained an H4 N-terminal deletion. These results indicate that the SIR3 mutations do not bypass the requirement for the H4 N terminus but, rather, allow repression in the presence of a less than optimal H4 N terminus. This provides a link between one of the SIR proteins and a component of chromatin.\r"

  ".W": "Colocalization of neurotransmitters, including neuropeptides and amines, in the same neuron of certain areas or well-defined nuclei of the central and peripheral nervous systems appears to be the rule rather than the exception. The coexistent neurotransmitters can be coreleased and interact at pre- and postsynaptic levels in a synergistic or antagonistic manner. Galanin is a recently isolated and characterized \"gut-brain\" peptide. It is colocalized with many neurotransmitters in both the central and the peripheral nervous systems. Among other regions in the central nervous system, galanin is present in neuronal perikarya of the septum and the hypothalamus. The dense accumulation of nerve terminals in the external zone of the median eminence suggests that galanin is an important peptide regulating neuroendocrine functions. Although most galanin and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons have a distinctly different morphology, a subset of galanin-immunoreactive perikarya in the diagonal band of Broca and the medial preoptic area, near the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, have morphological features similar to those of LHRH neurons. By using double-labeling immunocytochemistry, we have found that in the preoptic region of the male rat brain approximately 15-20% of these \"LHRH-like\" galanin-immunoreactive neurons are also immunopositive for LHRH. Moreover, in the medial preoptic area and the diagonal band of Broca, some of the single-labeled LHRH cells are surrounded with galanin-immunoreactive nerve terminals, suggesting that LHRH perikarya have synaptic contacts with galanin-immunoreactive terminals. Additional studies indicated that galanin can readily enhance in vitro release of LHRH from nerve terminals in the median eminence. The observations that (i) galanin is coexpressed with LHRH, (ii) galanin seems to innervate LHRH-producing neurons, and (iii) galanin acts as a putative neurotransmitter to enhance the release of LHRH suggest that galanin should be considered an important regulator of LHRH-containing neurons and, therefore, of reproductive functions.\r"

Microsequencing showed that HIV-1 PR cleaved both human and murine vimentin between leucine-422 and arginine-423 within the sequence between positions 418 and 427, Ser-Ser-Leu-Asn-Leu/Arg-Glu-Thr-Asn-Leu (SSLNL/RETNL). Minor cleavages at other sites were also observed. Heat-denatured vimentin was cleaved by HIV-1 PR less efficiently than native vimentin. A decapeptide containing the sequence SSLN-LRETNL was also cleaved in vitro by HIV-1 PR as predicted. The presence of a charged residue (arginine) at the primary cleavage site distinguishes this from other known naturally occurring cleavage sites. Microinjection of HIV-1 PR into cultured human fibroblasts resulted in a 9-fold increase in the percentage of cells with an altered and abnormal distribution of vimentin intermediate filaments. Most commonly, the intermediate filaments collapsed into a clump with a juxtanuclear localization. These results support the possibility that intermediate filament proteins may serve as substrates within HIV-1-infected cells.\r"

Hippocampal size is known to correlate positively with maze performance in laboratory mouse strains and with selective pressure for spatial memory among passerine bird species. In polygamous vole species (Rodentia: Microtus), males range more widely than females in the field and perform better on laboratory measures of spatial ability; both of these differences are absent in monogamous vole species. Ten females and males were taken from natural populations of two vole species, the polygamous meadow vole, M. pennsylvanicus, and the monogamous pine vole, M. pinetorum. Only in the polygamous species do males have larger hippocampi relative to the entire brain than do females. Two-way analysis of variance shows that the ratio of hippocampal volume to brain volume is differently related to sex in these two species. To our knowledge, no previous studies of hippocampal size have linked both evolutionary and psychometric data to hippocampal dimensions. Our controlled comparison suggests that evolution can produce adaptive sex differences in behavior and its neural substrate.\r"

The library was screened with rabbit polyclonal anti-E. histolytica serum. A 700-base-pair cDNA insert was isolated and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA revealed a cysteine-rich protein. DNA hybridizations showed that the gene was specific to E. histolytica since the cDNA probe reacted with DNA from four axenic strains of E. histolytica but did not react with DNA from Entamoeba invadens, Acanthamoeba castellanii, or Trichomonas vaginalis. The insert was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-1 and the protein was expressed as a fusion with the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase. Purified fusion protein was used to generate 22 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and a mouse polyclonal antiserum specific for the E. histolytica portion of the fusion protein. A 29-kDa protein was identified as a surface antigen when mAbs were used to immunoprecipitate the antigen from metabolically 35S-labeled live trophozoites. The surface location of the antigen was corroborated by mAb immunoprecipitation of a 29-kDa protein from surface-125I-labeled whole trophozoites as well as by the reaction of mAbs with live trophozoites in an indirect immunofluorescence assay performed at 4 degrees C. Immunoblotting with mAbs demonstrated that the antigen was present on four axenic isolates tested. mAbs recognized epitopes on the 29-kDa native antigen on some but not all clinical isolates tested.\r"

One of the genes isolated is distinctive in that it does not contain repeat sequences typical of many malarial genes cloned by immunoscreening of bacterial expression libraries. The second gene apparently encodes a polymorphic version of the P. falciparum merozoite surface antigen Ag513, since the two sequences are identical in the 5' and 3' coding regions but diverge completely in the center.

Previous studies have shown that O-2A progenitors exposed to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) divide as migratory bipolar cells a limited number of times, with a cell cycle time of 18 hr, before clonally related progenitors differentiate into nondividing oligodendrocytes with a timing similar to that seen in vivo. In contrast, O-2A progenitors grown in the absence of mitogen do not divide but instead differentiate prematurely into oligodendrocytes, and progenitors exposed to appropriate inducing factors differentiate into type-2 astrocytes. We now have found that O-2A progenitors can be induced to undergo continuous self-renewal in the absence of oligodendrocytic differentiation by exposure to a combination of PDGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). With the exception of the inhibition of differentiation, the O-2A progenitors exposed to PDGF and bFGF behaved similarly to those exposed to PDGF alone. In contrast, progenitors exposed to basic bFGF alone were multipolar, had a cell-cycle length of 45 hr, showed little migratory behavior, underwent premature oligodendrocytic differentiation, and did not cease division upon expression of oligodendrocyte marker antigens. Thus, inhibition of differentiation required the presence of both mitogens. Our results demonstrate that PDGF and bFGF act on O-2A progenitors as both inducers of division and as regulators of differentiation that modulate multiple aspects of O-2A progenitor development and, additionally, reveal a previously unrecognized means of regulating self-renewal processes, wherein cooperation between growth factors promotes continuous division in the absence of differentiation.\r"

Millions of different hexapeptides were expressed at the N terminus of the adsorption protein (pIII) of fd phage. The vector fAFF1, derived from the tetracycline resistance-transducing vector fd-tet, allows cloning of oligonucleotides in a variety of locations in the 5' region of gene III. A library of 3 x 10(8) recombinants was generated by cloning randomly synthesized oligonucleotides. The library was screened for high-avidity binding to a monoclonal antibody (3-E7) that is specific for the N terminus of beta-endorphin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe). Fifty-one clones selected by three rounds of the affinity purification technique called panning were sequenced and found to differ from previously known ligands for this antibody. The striking finding is that all 51 contained tyrosine as the N-terminal residue and that 48 contained glycine as the second residue. The binding affinities of six chemically synthesized hexapeptides from this set range from 0.35 microM (Tyr-Gly-Phe-Trp-Gly-Met) to 8.3 microM (Tyr-Ala-Gly-Phe-Ala-Gln), compared with 7.1 nM for a known high-affinity ligand (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu). These results show that ligands can be identified with no prior information concerning antibody specificity. Peptide libraries are also likely to be useful in finding ligands that bind to other classes of receptors and in discovering pharmacologic agents.\r"

Initiation of unwinding may occur specifically at either a mismatch or a nick, although no direct evidence for this has previously been reported. It has recently been shown that helicase II can unwind fully duplex linear and nicked circular DNA with lengths of at least approximately 2700 base pairs in vitro; hence, a flanking region of single-stranded DNA is not required to initiate DNA unwinding. In studies with uniquely nicked duplex DNA, we present EM evidence that helicase II protein initiates DNA unwinding at the nick, with unwinding proceeding bidirectionally. We also show that helicase II protein initiates DNA unwinding at the blunt ends of linear DNA, rather than in internal regions. These data provide direct evidence that helicase II protein can initiate unwinding of duplex DNA at a nick, in the absence of auxiliary proteins. We propose that helicase II may initiate unwinding from a nick in a number of DNA repair processes.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian intestinal epithelium undergoes continuous and rapid renewal of its four principal terminally differentiated cell types. These cells arise from multipotent stem cells located at or near the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. The differentiation process is precisely organized along two spatial dimensions (axes)--from the crypt to the villus tip and from the duodenum to the colon. The enteroendocrine cell population provides a sensitive marker of the intestine's topologic differentiation. At least 15 different regionally distributed subsets have been described based on their principal neuroendocrine products. We have used immunocytochemical methods to characterize the spatial relationships of the serotonin-, secretin-, and substance P-containing enteroendocrine cell subsets in normal adult C57BL/6J x LT/Sv mice as well as in transgenic littermates that contain rat liver fatty acid-binding protein-human growth hormone fusion genes. Our results reveal precise spatial interrelationships between these populations and suggest a differentiation pathway that may involve the sequential expression of substance P, serotonin, and secretin.\r"

Herein we have colocalized the glycoprotein and the alpha subunit of the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase to the tubulovesicular membranes of the parietal cell by immunogold electron microscopy. Moreover, the glycoprotein and the alpha subunit were coimmunoprecipitated, and copurified by immunoaffinity chromatography, with an anti-glycoprotein monoclonal antibody. The pig glycoprotein was purified by chromatography on tomato lectin-Sepharose, and five tryptic peptides from the purified glycoprotein were partially sequenced. The complete amino acid sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of overlapping cDNA clones, showed 33% similarity to the sequence of the beta subunit of the pig kidney Na+/K(+)-ATPase. We therefore propose that the 60- to 90-kDa glycoprotein autoantigen is the beta subunit of the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase and that the alpha and beta subunits of the proton pump are major targets for autoimmunization in autoimmune gastritis.\r"

We report here the isolation of a cDNA clone for rat liver sepiapterin reductase. The cDNA has been excised from a lambda vector and the DNA sequence was determined. The insert contains the coding sequence for at least 95% of the rat enzyme and is fused to the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase N-terminal segment and the lac promoter. The N-terminal region of the clone contains an extraordinarily high G + C content. The amino acid sequence deduced from the clone is in agreement with the size and composition of the enzyme and was matched to several tryptic peptide sequences. The enzyme encoded by the cDNA insert was shown to have sepiapterin reductase activity after expression in E. coli. Structural similarities were identified between this protein and several enzymes that should contain similar nucleotide and pteridine binding sites.\r"

In the pH range between 6.6 and 8.0, changes in external [H+] had negligible influence on the amplitude and kinetics of the monovalent ion-carrying currents activated by the agonists quisqualate and kainate. The divalent ion-carrying N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-activated current, on the other hand, was strongly modulated by extracellular [H+]. Increased external [H+] suppressed, whereas decreased external [H+] enhanced, the NMDA-activated current. Changes in internal [H+] had little or no effect on the NMDA-activated current. Modulation of the NMDA-activated current resulted primarily from changes in the number of channel openings. Neither the unitary conductance nor the individual open dwell-times were significantly affected. These results suggest that the protonation site is on the external aspect of the channel and is far removed from the channel permeation pathway. Because interactions between H+, NMDA, and glycine in activating the current were predominantly noncompetitive, our results suggest that the modulatory effect of H+ was not associated with changes in receptor-agonist affinities. These results suggest that modulation of the NMDA-receptor channel by [H+] may be an intrinsic protective mechanism by which calcium influx into neurons is regulated, particularly in hypoxic/ischemic conditions.\r"

We report that monovalent antibodies (Fab fragments) raised against an endogenous cerebellar soluble lectin (CSL) completely inhibit neuronal migration in cultures of cerebellar explants at concentrations as low as 50 micrograms/ml. A similar inhibition pattern was obtained with Fab fragments prepared against one of the endogenous glycoprotein ligands of CSL, the 31-kDa glycoprotein (this glycoprotein is a membrane-bound glycoprotein specifically occurring, in the cerebellum, at the surface of immature neurons). We propose that this lectin-glycoprotein interaction supports the adhesion between neurons and the astrocyte guide during the migration of cerebellar immature neurons.\r"

Eleven flaps exhibited signs of circulatory failure between 1 hour and 6 days postoperatively and required return to the operating room. In eight patients the preoperative diagnosis was venous thrombosis, and in three patients it was arterial thrombosis. The average time from the first abnormal examination to exploration was 1.5 hours. There were no false-positive explorations. All 11 flaps were salvaged following correction of the cause of circulatory compromise. In eight patients this was due to inflow or outflow obstruction in the recipient vessels proximal to the anastomosis, in two patients it was due to extrinsic compression of the flap from a tight wound closure, and in one patient it was due to obstruction of the recipient vein by a drain. Primary anastomotic thrombosis was not encountered as the cause of circulatory compromise in any patient. An aggressive approach to exploration was responsible for an increase in flap survival in the entire series from 90 to 98 percent. The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of clinical monitoring, the role of early exploration, and the durability of microvascular anastomoses.\r"

The degree and extent of change in, and the usefulness of, various parameters of disease activity were also evaluated. Two hundred patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly allocated to either sulphasalazine or penicillamine and monitored for a minimum of two years. Fifty-one percent of the 102 patients who received sulphasalazine continued treatment for two years, compared with 40 per cent of the 98 patients allocated to penicillamine. The proportion of patients stopping therapy because of adverse reactions or due to lack or loss of effect was similar in the two groups. There was no difference between the two groups in the extent of improvement in clinical and laboratory variables at one and two years. The majority of patients showed improvement in most measured parameters; very few showed global improvement. The degree of improvement varied with the parameter assessed, being greatest in relatively easily measured variables such as duration of morning stiffness and ESR, and least for functional index. The effect and toxicity of these two agents in this setting was as anticipated. No clinically relevant difference could be demonstrated between the two drugs.\r"

Almost all were hospitalized with significant underlying diseases, had received previous antibiotic therapy, and had undergone procedures that interrupted the normal integumentary defense. Leuconostoc bacteremia was associated with fever, leukocytosis, and gastrointestinal complaints. Eight of 15 patients had polymicrobial bacteremia, seven of these eight with staphylococcal species. Clinical isolates of Leuconostoc were frequently misidentified, usually as viridans streptococci. All clinical isolates identified to date--and most agricultural isolates--demonstrate a high level of resistance to vancomycin. Successful regimens for treatment of Leuconostoc include high-dose penicillin, clindamycin, and where appropriate, removal of infected intravascular catheters. Susceptibility testing of all gram-positive bacteria isolated from normally sterile body sites is recommended.\r"

All of these patients had factors predisposing them to respiratory tract infections, e.g., neurologic disease, congestive heart failure, or cigarette smoking. A fifth patient, who was bacteremic without an apparent primary focus, had dysgammaglobulinemia. Six episodes of bacteremia occurred in five patients; 11 of 13 cultures of blood obtained before parenteral antibiotic therapy were positive. All isolates were biotype I and susceptible to ampicillin. Antibiotic therapy was curative in cases of proved respiratory tract infection but failed in the setting of nosocomial septicemia, perhaps because of delayed initiation. The brevity of antibiotic treatment of the cryptogenic bacteremia permitted infection of a prosthetic vascular graft and recurrent bacteremia. Graft removal and repeated antibiotic therapy were curative.\r"

Transplantation centers drawing patients from areas with endemic Strongyloides should evaluate potential recipients closely for occult strongyloides infection prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapy. Empiric therapy with thiabendazole should be considered for renal allograft recipients with unexplained eosinophilia and a history of travel or residence in an area with endemic Strongyloides. Prophylactic monthly administration of thiabendazole in immunocompromised patients who have survived strongyloides hyperinfection or dissemination can prevent reinfection.\r"

Geriatric inmates often have chronic medical illnesses that may result in hospitalization for infectious complications. These infectious conditions may be related to factors such as institutionalization (e.g., tuberculosis and influenza), chronic medical illness (e.g., pneumococcal pneumonia), and a history of alcohol or drug use (e.g., hepatitis B virus and retrovirus infection). The epidemiology of these conditions is reviewed. Since infectious complications among geriatric inmates will add stress to a correctional health care system that is already burdened by inmates with AIDS-related illnesses, clinical recognition of these complications and preventive measures are of great importance.\r"

In vitro studies demonstrate that zidovudine is toxic to the myeloid and erythroid precursors in the bone marrow; at concentrations of zidovudine near those associated with the optimal antiviral effect in vitro, the proliferative capability of these progenitor cells is reduced 50%-70%. The clinical manifestations of anemia and leukopenia generally are time- and dose-dependent. Strategies for alleviating the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine include the use of hematopoietic growth factors, such as erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Myopathy, a recently recognized toxic effect of zidovudine, also appears to be time-dependent. Patients often complain of muscle weakness and discomfort and exhibit an associated elevation in creatine phosphokinase level; dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy generally is required. Some patients have experienced high fever, nausea, and vomiting; however, these effects are unusual and of unclear etiology. The substantial proportion of patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex receiving zidovudine who experience hematologic or muscular toxicity may benefit from treatment with new antiviral agents, such as dideoxyinosine, with toxicity profiles different from that of zidovudine.\r"

In contrast, most isolates from these patients showed decreased sensitivity after 6 months or more of zidovudine administration. Isolates from several patients showed progressive, stepwise reductions in sensitivity.

In most HIV-infected children the infection is acquired perinatally and the course of infection is more accelerated than in adults. Diseases related to B cell defects and dysgammaglobulinemia (e.g., multiple or recurrent bacterial infections) predominate early in the disease, and children can be symptomatic before their CD4+ count decreases. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis occurs frequently and almost exclusively in children, and a number of the opportunistic infections (e.g., cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis) or malignancies (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma) occur infrequently in children. A major disease manifestation in the pediatric population is HIV encephalopathy, which results in impairment in neurologic development that can lead to loss or lack of developmental milestones and to diminished intellectual function. The methodology and design of clinical trials for the study of pediatric HIV infection should consider these clinical and laboratory manifestations as well as the developmental differences that reflect the disease in infants and young children.\r"

  ".W": "Since recommendations for the treatment of chancroid were made in 1985, in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the two drugs recommended, erythromycin (500 mg four times a day for 7 days) and ceftriaxone (250 mg intramuscularly in a single dose), remain effective. The alternative therapies of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg twice a day for 7 days) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (500/125 mg three times a day for 7 days) also appear to be effective, although there has been little experience with these drugs in the United States. Single-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (640/3,200 mg) now lacks the efficacy of other regimens. The experience with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day for 3 days) has been favorable, and other quinolones may prove useful. Concurrent infection with human immunodeficiency virus appears to result in an increased rate of failure of treatment for chancroid, and such cases may require more prolonged therapy.\r"

Because of penicillin's great success, clinical trials stopped after an initial period of intensive investigation. Syphilis is a difficult disease to study; the natural history may span decades in an individual, and diagnosis and outcome are usually defined serologically, not clinically or bacteriologically. Although the recommended penicillin regimens changed, clinical trials were not repeated. Furthermore, because the early studies occurred before modern clinical-trial methodology was developed, interpretation of the results is difficult. As a result, while current regimens for syphilis therapy are effective, they may or may not be optimal. With the accumulation of reports of treatment failures and the recent appearance of human immunodeficiency virus, current regimens for the treatment of syphilis are being questioned. As background for a meeting at which treatment guidelines were reviewed, the available literature on syphilis therapy is summarized herein.\r"

Several new regimens have been shown to be effective and are likely to be more convenient for patients than previous schedules. In vitro resistance to acyclovir does not appear to be associated with clinical failure of treatment in immunocompetent hosts, but available data are limited and concerns remain. Failure of treatment in cases due to acyclovir-resistant strains has been reported in immunocompromised patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The safety of acyclovir use by pregnant women has not been established. The value of acyclovir for the prevention of mucocutaneous ulcerations in asymptomatic persons or for the prevention of primary infections is unknown. Judicious use of acyclovir only by persons with clinically apparent infections is warranted at the present time.\r"

The mainstay of treatment for chlamydial infections has been the tetracyclines. Doxycycline, comparable in cost to tetracycline and with a less frequent dosage schedule, is the drug of first choice. Erythromycins are the drugs of choice for infections in pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, children, and adults unable to tolerate tetracyclines. beta-Lactam antibiotics have had variable efficacy against C. trachomatis infections, although recent studies suggest that amoxicillin may be an effective alternative for C. trachomatis infection during pregnancy. Quinolones are currently being tested and may be used in alternative regimens in the future. The effectiveness of current antimicrobial regimens in preventing long-term complications of chlamydial infections should be determined in research studies.\r"

Further, the lack of data on laparoscopic diagnosis and cure of PID severely limits our ability to interpret data on therapy outcome. Validation studies of the treatment regimens recommended by the Centers for Disease Control in the 1985 treatment guidelines for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) suggest that both the cefoxitin/doxycycline and clindamycin/aminoglycoside combination regimens result in consistently high rates of clinical evidence of cure. The 1989 STD treatment guidelines were based on these studies and on available data regarding newer treatment regimens. Empiric, broad-spectrum therapy remains the treatment of choice. The two regimens recommended for inpatient therapy in 1989 are similar to those recommended in 1985. The recommendation for management of ambulatory patients has been substantially changed, however, because of increasing resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin.\r"

A single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole still remains highly effective against most Trichomonas vaginalis infections. Mildly resistant infections can usually be cured with metronidazole oral doses of 2 g daily for 3-7 days. When highly resistant infections occur, toxic levels of metronidazole may be needed for the drug to cure the infection. Metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 days) continues to be highly efficacious in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Shorter oral treatment regimens that use single 2-g doses of metronidazole for 2-3 days appear promising but may be associated with higher relapse rates. Oral clindamycin (300 mg twice daily) or local 2% clindamycin cream (once daily for 7 days) also may be effective. Metronidazole intravaginal sponges (250-1,000 mg) used for 3 days may also be effective in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.\r"

In both adults and children, postassault infections with viral agents of STDs, including herpes simplex viruses, hepatitis B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, have been described.

Recurrence of tumor was diagnosed in 69 of the remaining 143 patients during follow-up treatment with monthly serum alpha-fetoprotein measurements and imaging studies that were performed every three months. There were 61 men and eight women whose ages ranged from 33 to 78 years. The histologic factors noted were cirrhosis of the liver in 60 patients and chronic hepatitis in nine. There were multiple or diffuse recurrences (Type A) in 34 instances, one to three nodular recurrences (Type B) in 21, marginal recurrences (Type C) in 11 and a mixed form of the latter two in three instances. Two-thirds of the recurrences were found within 1.5 years and the second peak was noted between 2.0 and 2.5 years. Sex of patient, hepatitis B virus, type of tumor, capsule, extent of hepatic resection and postoperative chemotherapy did not influence the rate of recurrence, but cirrhotic livers had a significantly higher recurrence rate. A second hepatic resection was performed upon 20 patients with a five year survival rate of 26.8 per cent. Good results were obtained by chemoembolization of the hepatic artery. Prevention and adequate treatment of intrahepatic recurrence are of paramount importance in achieving better surgical results for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".U": "90350078\r", 
  ".W": "Our experience at Hippokration Athens Hospital with high-resolution real-time ultrasonography of the deep veins of the lower extremities is described, drawn from the results of a prospective comparative study of 65 patients. We used a combination of sonography and contrast venography for the detection of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Of the study group, 33 had clinically suspected DVT, 20 were asymptomatic high-risk patients, while 12 with varicosities of the leg and scheduled for saphenectomy were examined preoperatively for deep venous patency confirmation. For all patients, venography, the reference method, was performed within 12 hours of the ultrasound scan. Since 29 of the examinations were bilateral, the total number of extremities studied was 94. The sonographic criteria analyzed were the intraluminal echogenicity and the venous compressibility with the ultrasound transducer probe. In addition, the response of the common femoral vein to the Valsalva maneuver was studied. Among these three criteria, compressibility was by far the most accurate. Noncompressible abnormal veins were noted in all of the 24 extremities with proximal thrombosis and in six of the 12 with thrombosis limited to the calf veins. Thus, the sensitivity of the compressibility criterion was 100 per cent for proximal and 50 per cent for isolated calf venous thrombosis (83 per cent). All venographically patent veins were fully compressible (specificity, 100 per cent). Abnormal intraluminal echoes were found in 18 of the 36 extremities with thrombosis but not in those with negative findings on venography. Sensitivity of intraluminal echogenicity was, therefore, 50 per cent and specificity, 100 per cent. For the Valsalva criterion, the standard lower normal limit of 10 per cent was applied, leading to 40 per cent sensitivity and 93 per cent specificity rates. In comparison with venography, ultrasonography underestimated the extent of thrombosis in 60 per cent of the true-positive examinations, although never to a clinically significant degree. In conclusion, compression ultrasonography, a technique based upon the unique criterion of venous compressibility, is a highly accurate and objective noninvasive diagnostic method, and is also suitable as a screening test. We urge clinicians to support their therapeutic decisions concerning the management of DVT with it.\r"

  ".W": "Flow cytometric DNA content analysis is a rapid, quantitative method of determining the DNA ploidy status and proliferative index of a given tumor. Abnormal DNA content, or aneuploidy, has been recognized as a marker of malignancy and is present in about 70 per cent of solid tumors. In the majority of solid tumors, the consensus is that the presence of an aneuploid tumor predicts a poorer over-all survival rate and a shorter disease-free interval, indicating that patients with diploid tumors have a more favorable prognosis than those with aneuploid tumors. The prognostic implications of an abnormal DNA content, therefore, suggest either a higher risk of relapse, a worsening of survival rate or a risk for progression of disease in stages I and II carcinoma of the breast, carcinoma of the colon and rectum, superficial carcinoma of the bladder and malignant melanoma. Thus, the assessment of cellular DNA content should be regarded as an additional prognostic determinant and should play an ancillary role in the decisions regarding the management of patients with malignant disease. With the introduction of more sophisticated technology, it will be possible to simultaneously assay for DNA ploidy and cell cycle distribution in addition to a series of tumor markers, such as CEA, and various products of oncogenes, thus providing further understanding of the heterogeneity of solid tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "The primary aim of postoperative surveillance of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum is to detect recurrent tumor when cure is still possible. Most recurrences are detected within 30 months after the initial operation. Patients who have had carcinoma of the colon and rectum must be observed not only because of the risk of recurrence or metastatic disease but also because of the increased risk of subsequent primary carcinomas of the colon and rectum as well as of other sites. Careful history-taking and thorough physical examination provide the first indication of tumor recurrence in as many as 48 per cent of instances. Although the liver is the most common site of metastases from carcinoma of the colon, liver chemistry tests are seldom the first to indicate recurrent disease. Fecal occult blood testing, roentgenography with barium enema and colonoscopy are useful surveillance tools, not for detecting recurrences but for detecting second primary carcinomas. Imaging techniques, such as intravenous pyelography, CT and scintigraphy of liver and spleen are generally not cost-effective in surveillance, but MRI and ultrasonography have shown some promise in detection of recurrence without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. The most effective indicator of recurrent disease is a progressive increase in serial levels of CEA. When CEA levels rise and other methods of imaging cannot account for the change, second-look operation is generally appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "The sulfonylureas have pharmacologic effects both on insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells and on responsiveness to insulin in peripheral tissues. The effects of the sulfonylureas on skeletal muscle may have a particularly significant influence on glucose homeostasis because of the important role of muscle as a peripheral site of glucose clearance. Under most physiologic conditions, the rate-limiting step for glucose utilization in muscle is its uptake across the plasma membrane; for this reason, the effects of the sulfonylureas on glucose transport have been a focus for study. In muscle tissue, the sulfonylureas appear to augment the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin but not to alter glucose homeostasis in the absence of insulin. The mechanism of this effect, which requires several hours of exposure to a sulfonylurea, has not been defined. Although studies with cultured muscle cells have yielded inconsistent findings, recent work with the L6 rat skeletal muscle cell line demonstrated that the sulfonylureas exerted effects similar to those in muscle tissue both in time course and in requirement for co-stimulation by insulin. Mechanistic studies in L6 cells have shown that the sulfonylureas induce increased glucose transporter messenger ribonucleic acid levels and increased total cellular content of transporter proteins even in the absence of insulin, but that insulin is required for augmented glucose uptake activity. Based on these data, it has been suggested that insulin may cause the activation of transporters synthesized in response to sulfonylureas. The definition of the mechanism of this synergistic response to insulin and the sulfonylureas in L6 muscle cells may give insight into the in vivo molecular events involved in the action of the sulfonylureas in skeletal muscle.\r"

Recently, expression of this epitope was noted in normal endometrium during the secretory, but not proliferative, menstrual interval. In light of known hormonal control of normal endometrial growth and differentiation, we investigated in vitro expression of TAG-72 epitope in purified endometrial epithelium cultured under serum-free conditions on Matrigel biomatrix. Cells from secretory endometrium exhibited homogeneous tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 epitope expression. Unexpectedly, epithelium from the proliferative interval developed expression after 5 to 6 days of culture. Epithelial cells from both intervals maintained expression over 12 days of culture without exogenous estradiol and progesterone. Spontaneous, uniform expression of tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 epitope by normal endometrial epithelial cells in vitro is in marked contrast to the cyclic, heterogeneous expression observed in vivo. Such expression also differs from published in vitro observations of cancer cell lines that express this epitope.\r"

Peak systolic and mean velocities in the first and second trimesters were almost the same as those in nonpregnant women, whereas they became slower in the third trimester. Pulsatility index from 4 to 31 weeks' gestation was significantly higher than in nonpregnant women, but fell to the nonpregnant value after 32 weeks. Doppler velocimetry was found to be an extremely useful method of cerebrohemodynamic evaluation in pregnant women.\r"

Women using the active spermicide experienced a somewhat lower incidence rate of trichomoniasis (relative rate 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.12) and bacterial vaginosis (relative rate 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.12) as compared with placebo users.

Whereas odor and discharge were the most common symptoms, 30 patients (44.8%) also complained of vulvovaginal irritation. Symptoms correlated poorly with objective therapeutic outcome. On examination the diagnosis would have been missed in seven patients (10.4%) if the clinician relied on presence of an abnormal vaginal discharge to suggest bacterial vaginosis. Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 was found immediately after curative therapy in 59.6% of patients. Mobiluncus spp. morphotypes were 99.0% specific and 52.1% sensitive and proline aminopeptidase activity in vaginal fluid was 84.4% sensitive and 70.2% specific for diagnosis. Our Gram stain criteria yielded no false-negative results, 6.1% false-positive, and frequent indeterminate results after therapy. We found little evidence for sexual transmission of bacterial vaginosis. Recurrence after effective therapy was not predicted by vaginal pH elevation, positive or indeterminate Gram stain result, or positive proline aminopeptidase test.\r"

Success of treatment was defined as the occurrence of fetal expulsion within 72 hours after the first drug intake. Mifepristone treatment (600 mg per day for 2 days) was considered to be effective in 29 of 46 patients (63%). There were only eight successes in 48 patients (17.4%) in the placebo group (p = 0.001, chi 2 test). Tolerance was good in the mifepristone group. In the placebo group, disseminated intravascular coagulation occurred in one woman for whom the investigator waited several weeks for spontaneous expulsion. This large double-blind controlled study provides evidence that mifepristone is of interest in the management of intrauterine fetal death. It could provide a pharmacologic alternative to the use of prostaglandins in this indication.\r"

We propose such a test that is based on the degree of modulation of fetal ductal blood flow velocity by fetal breathing movements after maternal glucose loading. In a prospective cross-sectional study of 49 normal pregnancies (50 fetuses) between 25 and 38 weeks an exponential increase in breathing-related ductal blood flow velocity modulation was observed with advancing gestational age, reflecting the developing pulmonary vascular bed. Fetal ductal flow velocity waveforms were also recorded in 13 cases of prolonged severe oligohydramnios after ruptured membranes before 28 weeks' gestation. Normal ductal blood flow velocity modulation values were associated with normal neonatal lung performance, whereas reduced ductal blood flow velocity modulation values were associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. Fetal breathing-related ductal flow velocity modulation appears to be a promising predictor of neonatal lung performance.\r"

In the present study we confirmed, by immunohistologic labeling with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, that bcl-2 protein is strongly expressed in many cases of follicular lymphoma and that these neoplastic follicles differ clearly from their nonmalignant counterpart (reactive germinal centres) in which bcl-2 protein is undetectable. However we also found bcl-2 protein in normal T- and B-lymphoid cells and in a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders in which the 14;18 translocation is not present. It is therefore concluded that expression of bcl-2 protein is not a specific marker for lymphomas bearing the 14;18 chromosomal translocation and that the observations of other investigators may have reflected the inadequate sensitivity of their staining procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) defines a biochemically heterogeneous entity that manifests as effacement of cerebral microvessel walls by a fibrillar material with characteristic tinctorial properties. In biochemical terms, the amyloid that infiltrates blood vessels in CAA is composed of the A4 or beta peptide of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a molecule related to gamma trace or cystatin C (seen in patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis in Iceland, HCHWA-I), or the PrP characteristic of spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie. Using antibodies to synthetic peptides representing portions of the 4.2-kd Alzheimer A4 peptide and the gamma-trace peptide, we immunostained sections of brain from patients with AD, senile dementia of Alzheimer's type, and CAA with associated leukoencephalopathy. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated colocalization of the A4 and gamma-trace peptides within arteriolar walls, but only rarely in A4 amyloidotic capillaries or senile plaque cores of amyloid. When gamma-tracelike reactivity was noted in capillary walls, it was sometimes noted within the cytoplasm of pericytes. Immunostaining was always more intense when the anti-A4 antibody was used as the primary antibody. Gamma-trace immunostaining was more prominent on the adventitial component of arteriolar walls, whereas A4 staining was usually seen more diffusely throughout the blood vessel wall, especially in the media. Rarely individual pericytelike cells showed prominent gamma-trace immunoreactivity. These findings suggest that A4 and gamma-tracelike molecules may colocalize within arteriolar walls within the brains of patients with AD, and highlight the fact that CAA identified with AD and HCHWA-I are not as biochemically distinct as was assumed previously. Furthermore these findings suggest that other peptidases or protease inhibitors may be found within amyloidotic microvessel walls and may contribute to senile brain change and CAA-related strokes, including hemorrhage and encephalomalacia.\r"

  ".W": "Five cases of inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) of the lymph node were investigated by means of light microscopy and immunohistochemistry to elucidate its cellular composition. The IPT is composed of a proliferation of spindle cells, inflammatory cells, and small vessels, forming high and poor cellular areas. Many spindle cells correspond to activated histiocytes as they coexpress vimentin and macrophage-associated markers; they are intermingled with vimentin-positive fibroblasts and variable numbers of vimentin- and actin-positive myofibroblasts. This mixed-cell proliferation invades and/or destroys medium- and large-sized vessels in all cases. This study indicates that the spindle cell proliferation, identified as histiocytic and fibroblastic in nature, represents the main component of the nodal IPT. We speculate that release of cytokines by the activated histiocytes may result in the development of the complex histopathologic aspects of this inflammatory process and, if inappropriate, may represent the underlying pathogenic mechanism.\r"

The reduction in inflammation is noted in the animals administered a contra-interleukin-2 (IL-2) cytokine secreted by a cloned T-cell line. The mechanism of reduction of inflammation by this cytokine is through the inhibition of activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes. The cytokine inhibits the in vitro mitogen activation of T-cell lymphocytes as well as antigen-specific activation of a collagen type II specific T-cell line. In addition, decreased levels of messenger RNA coding for interleukin-2 are noted in T lymphocytes and IL-2 activation of the collagen type II specific cell line is inhibited by the contra-IL-2 cytokine. This initial description of a reduction in inflammation by a contra-IL-2 lymphokine suggests that immunoregulatory biologic molecules that are antagonists to IL-2 may be useful for the experimental immunotherapy of cartilage connective tissue pathology.\r"

These two types of cells were induced to differentiate with a combination of phorbol ester, retinoic acid, and extracellular matrix. The induced cells displayed the morphology of histiocytes or histiocytelike cells, with a small, round or oval, eccentric nucleus and abundant cytoplasm. In ultrastructural studies, many cytoplasmic projections and rugae were observed. These induced cells exhibited abundant cytoplasmic lysosomal enzymes, such as esterase, acid phosphatase, alpha 1-antitrypsin, or lysozyme. The histiocytic nature of these induced cells was further confirmed by the increased expression of many monocyte/histiocyte markers, including CD11b, CD11c, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD68, Mac387, and 1E9. In functional tests, the induced cells were shown to produce interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and/or prostaglandin E2. Phagocytosis was detected in less than 5% to 10% of the cells when Candida albicans was added to cultures. The results strongly suggest that H-RS cells are related to cells of histiocyte lineage.\r"

  ".U": "90350804\r", 
  ".W": "Recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was noted to support rat bone marrow colony formation in vitro. The in vivo hematologic effects of a single intravenous injection of murine GM-CSF were therefore investigated. Doses of murine GM-CSF between 0.1 and 5 micrograms/rat caused an increasing leukocytosis that did not further increase with a dose of 25 micrograms/rat. In contrast, human GM-CSF at 25 micrograms/rat did not induce any significant peripheral hematologic effects. Murine GM-CSF induced peripheral neutrophilia and monocytosis, peaking between 4 and 8 hours and subsiding to baseline by 12 hours. Neutropenia and monocytopenia, which reached a nadir at 15 minutes, preceded the leukocytosis, suggesting that GM-CSF activates these leukocytes and causes transient intravascular margination. A mild lymphopenia occurred between 2 to 8 hours. The bone marrow at 6 hours after injection of GM-CSF demonstrated a variable and slight left-shifted myeloid hyperplasia most noticeable at the level of promyelocytes and myelocytes, suggesting a myeloproliferative effect. The marrow at 6 hours also demonstrated a decrease in mature neutrophils, documenting that the marrow contributes to the increased number of circulating neutrophils. Once-daily injection of GM-CSF for 7 days induced a repetitive daily neutrophilia of the same magnitude. The marrow after 1 week of injections did not show a generalized myeloid hyperplasia, but did show an increase in eosinophils and a decrease in lymphocytes. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have been reported to synergize in vitro in both mouse and human bone marrow colony assays. However GM-CSF plus G-CSF in vivo, administered as either a single injection or as daily injections for 1 week, were found in the present study to induce, at most, an additive effect on circulating numbers of neutrophils. It is concluded that murine GM-CSF will be useful in the rat model to study the in vivo hematoreconstitutive effects of GM-CSF alone and in combination with other hematologic growth factors. The relatively rapid kinetics and lesser magnitude of GM-CSF-induced neutrophilia and monocytosis, as compared to G-CSF and M-CSF, respectively, and the lesser myeloproliferative effect of GM-CSF in bone marrow smears, as compared to G-CSF, might be taken to suggest that GM-CSF's natural activity is predominantly as an inflammatory rather than a myeloproliferative factor.\r"

To model these interactions in cell culture, focal crystalline deposits of cholestane-3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-triol, 25-OH cholesterol, and cholesterol were overlaid by a collagen gel, on which canine aortic smooth muscle cells were seeded. Oxysterols, but not cholesterol, caused focally decreased plating efficiency and cell death, leading to the formation of a persistent circular gap in the cell culture. Cholestanetriol was largely removed from the culture dishes over 3 to 4 weeks, whereas cholesterol and 25-OH cholesterol were largely retained. Smooth muscle cells were motile even in proximity to oxysterol crystals, with occasional suicidal migration toward the crystals. Chemoattraction, however, could not be demonstrated. Despite toxicity, cholestanetriol did not appear to alter the fraction of cells exhibiting 3H-thymidine uptake, even in areas close to the crystals. Thus, oxysterols may be toxic to some cells, without causing major impairment of the migration and proliferation of nearby cells. This would allow the simultaneous occurrence of cell death and proliferation evident in atherosclerosis.\r"

The cultures consisted of macrophages and smooth muscle cells, thus resembling, in composition, fatty streak lesions. The mean (+/- SD) cholesteryl ester content of the dispersed cells was 1059 +/- 445 micrograms/mg cell protein, but it declined steeply during 1 week in primary culture. The uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), beta-migrating very low-density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL), and acetylated LDL (acetyl-LDL), labeled with 125I or with the fluorescent probe 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'- tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI), was studied in 2-day-old primary cultures. DiI-acetyl-LDL was avidly taken up by the macrophages and, to a lesser extent, by some smooth muscle cells. The uptake of DiI-beta-VLDL by the macrophages was weaker and less homogeneous than that of DiI-acetyl-LDL. The degradation rates of 125I-labeled beta-VLDL, LDL and acetyl-LDL were 135 +/- 54, 195 +/- 20, and 697 +/- 14 ng/mg cell protein/8 hours, respectively. Incubation with unlabeled acetyl-LDL enhanced the incorporation of [3H]oleate into cholesteryl esters and increased the cellular cholesteryl ester content. These results suggest that arterial macrophages and, to some extent, smooth muscle cells from cholesterol-fed rabbits actively metabolize acetyl-LDL and are thus capable of accumulating cholesteryl esters by uptake of modified forms of LDL.\r"

DESIGN: Blind analysis of cell samples from matched cohorts for HIV proviral DNA by polymerase chain reaction, retrospective analysis of clinical data on patients, and prospective follow-up of patients seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). SETTING: National research clinic and academic medical centers. PATIENTS: Cohort 1 included 12 healthy HIV-1-seropositive patients (average follow-up, 14 months): Six patients had stable disease and 6 developed rapidly progressive disease. Cohort 2 included 15 healthy HIV-1-seropositive patients from the Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study (average follow-up, 32 months): Eight patients had stable disease and 7 developed rapidly progressive disease. LABORATORY STUDIES: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was done to determine the HIV-1 viral burden in sort-purified CD4+ T cells obtained from patients at various timepoints. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: In patients who remained asymptomatic, frequencies of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells were low (less than 1/10,000 to 1/1000) at study entry and increased only minimally (none higher than 1/1000). In contrast, among patients who developed HIV-related symptoms including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) despite having similar CD4 counts, frequencies of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells were higher at entry (greater than 1/1000) and increased substantially (greater than 1/100) in most within 3 months of developing progressive disease. This increase in HIV burden coincided with a significant decline over time in the percent of T4 cells (31% to 16%), whereas the percent of T4 cells was unchanged in persons who remained asymptomatic (33% to 34%). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing viral burden in peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells is directly associated with a progressive decline in CD4+ T cells and deteriorating clinical course in HIV-infected patients.\r"

Despite its uncertain cause, aging constitutes the most significant and universal problem confronting physicians today. Age-related physiologic deterioration and age-associated diseases are of immense concern to physicians because of the \"old-age boom\" anticipated in the first part of the twenty-first century. Biomedical research achievements in the twentieth century have permitted more persons to approach the fixed upper limit of the human lifespan. We discuss the functional decline of the aging heart and the underlying mechanisms of that decline; quantitative and qualitative changes in the immune system; and normal aging of the human brain contrasted to the brain changes seen in Alzheimer disease. With our growing geriatric population, we greatly need to increase our understanding of both the causes of human aging and the goals of gerontology and geriatrics and to expand research into the significant problem of Alzheimer disease.\r"

The activity of KB-5246 was twofold lower against an OmpF-deficient mutant and twofold higher against a mutant which produced OmpF constitutively than against the parent with osmoregulated OmpF production. KB-5246 had twofold-higher activity against a deep rough mutant of S. typhimurium than against the parent. The apparent uptake of KB-5246 in the OmpF-deficient mutant was decreased and its uptake in the deep rough mutant was increased when compared with those in the parents. These results suggest that KB-5246 is taken up by porin and nonporin pathways and has strong inhibitory activity against DNA gyrase, resulting in potent antibacterial activity.\r"

(S)-9-(3-Hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine [(S)-HPMPA], 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine, 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine, and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine inhibited DHBV core antigen synthesis at concentrations that were significantly lower than those found to be toxic to the primary hepatocytes. Of all the compounds tested, (S)-HPMPA showed the lowest 50% effective concentration (0.5 micrograms/ml). The selectivity index or ratio of the 50% cytotoxic concentration to the 50% effective concentration of (S)-HPMPA was greater than 300.

The in vitro susceptibilities and the clinical responses suggested that, with the possible exception of Pseudomonas spp., imipenem was more effective than ceftazidime in treating neutropenic infections caused by both gram-positive and -negative organisms. An additional 23 and 21% of the patients in the ceftazidime and imipenem groups, respectively, responded to the addition of cloxacillin and amikacin following failure of monotherapy. The majority of the treatment failures, relapses, and superinfections were related to resistant infective organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. or disseminated fungal infections.\r"

The ROB-1 gene showed low homologies with other beta-lactamases at the nucleic acid level. By using two statistical computer methods, assessment of the extent of similarity between ROB-1 and other known beta-lactamase amino acid sequences suggested that ROB-1 is a class A enzyme. Alignment of class A beta-lactamases with ROB-1 identified conserved residues. The use of a mutation matrix for detecting distance relationships indicated that ROB-1 has higher values and homologies with beta-lactamases of gram-positive bacteria, giving insight into its ancestry and divergence.\r"

Pentamidine and each of the analogs tested exhibited activity in vitro against L. m. amazonensis and P. falciparum. The pentamidine analogs were more effective against the P. falciparum clones than against L. m. amazonensis. P. falciparum was extremely susceptible to these compounds, with 50% inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.03 microM. While none of the analogs exhibited marked improvement in antileishmanial activity compared with pentamidine, 12 of the pentamidine analogs showed activity approximately equal to or greater than that of the parent compound. From the promising activity exhibited by the pentamidine analogs in this in vitro study and their potential for reduced toxicity relative to the parent drug, pentamidine-related compounds hold promise as new agents for the treatment of protozoal infections.\r"

  ".W": "A unique metabolic feature of malaria parasites is their restricted ability to synthesize nucleotides. These parasites are unable to synthesize the purine ring and must therefore obtain preformed purine bases and nucleosides from the host cell, the erythrocyte. On the other hand, pyrimidines must be synthesized de novo because of the inability of the parasites to salvage preformed pyrimidines. Thus, one would anticipate that the blockage of purine salvage or pyrimidine de novo synthesis should adversely affect parasite growth. This premise was tested in vitro with a total of 64 compounds, mostly purine and pyrimidine analogs, known to inhibit one or more steps of nucleotide synthesis. Of the 64 compounds, 22 produced a 50% inhibition of the growth of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum at a concentration of 50 microM or less. Inhibition of the growth of chloroquine-resistant clones of P. falciparum did not differ significantly from that of the growth of chloroquine-susceptible clones. Two of the compounds which effectively inhibited parasite growth, 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine, were found to be potent competitive inhibitors of a key purine-salvaging enzyme (hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase) of the parasite.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study, we found fecal colonization with multiresistant Escherichia coli exhibiting high-level trimethoprim resistance in 19% of diapered children attending six day-care centers in Houston, Tex. To examine the potential risk factors associated with this finding, we conducted cross-sectional studies among 203 children attending 12 day-care centers, 51 children attending a well-child clinic (controls), and 64 medical students. The prevalence of fecal colonization with trimethoprim-resistant E. coli among children attending day-care centers (30%) was higher (P less than 0.001) than among control children (6%) or medical students (8%). The prevalence of colonization among the children attending the 12 centers ranged from 0 to 59% and was correlated with the number of diapered children enrolled (r = 0.73; P less than 0.01). In a case control study among the day-care center children, significant risk factors were an age of less than 12 months and attendance at a center with an enrollment of over 40 diapered children (odds ratios of 2.2 and 3.5, respectively); ethnicity, duration of attendance, and prior antibiotic administration were not associated with colonization. Plasmid analysis of 60 of the day-care center strains revealed 22 profiles, each of which was unique to a given day-care center. Transmission and carriage of trimethoprim-resistant strains for as long as 6 months was documented in one center studied on three occasions. Given the documented transmission of enteric pathogens among diapered children attending day-care centers and their spread into family members, it is likely that day-care centers are an important community reservoir of plasmid-associated antibiotic-resistant E. coli.\r"

A total of 273 (95%) patients had a prodrome of diarrhoea. In these a seasonal variation in the incidence of haemolytic uraemic syndrome was demonstrated, the 1-2 year age range was most often affected, and the peripheral blood neutrophil count correlated positively with an adverse outcome. Patients presenting without diarrhoea showed none of these associations and had a significantly greater morbidity and mortality. Evidence for VTEC infection was found in 58 (33%) of 178 diarrhoea associated cases whose stools were analysed, although VTEC were identified in five of eight (62%) patients whose stools were collected within three days of the onset of diarrhoea. Most isolates produced VT2 either alone, or together with VT1. There was no evidence of VTEC infection in patients without prodromal diarrhoea.\r"

  ".W": "In a three year study of children under 16 years with haemolytic uraemic syndrome faecal samples were examined for the presence of Verocytotoxin producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) using DNA probes and for free neutralisable Verocytotoxin in a Vero cell assay with specific antisera. There was evidence of VTEC infection in 58 of 185 (31%) samples. A total of 53 VTEC was identified from patients with haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Thirty eight VTEC belonged to serotype 0157:H7 or 0157:H-, 34 produced VT2 only, and four strains produced both VT1 and VT2. The remaining 15 VTEC belonged to nine different 0 serogroups; three strains produced VT1, 10 produced VT2, and two were positive for VT1 and VT2. Three control groups of patients without haemolytic uraemic syndrome were also examined. There was evidence of VTEC infection in 8%, 6%, and 4% of specimens from individuals with bloody diarrhoea, those with diarrhoea only, and healthy controls respectively. VTEC from the bloody diarrhoeal and diarrhoeal controls were 0157:H7 but those from the healty controls could not be 0 serogrouped. This study confirms the association of VTEC, and particularly strains of 0157:H7, with haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Strains producing VT1, VT2, or both toxins were isolated, although over 94% of VTEC produced VT2 alone or together with VT1.\r"

  ".W": "Six hundred and eighty two assessments were performed on 641 babies under 6 months of age who presented to the emergency department of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, to try and determine the best markers of serious illness in young infants. Detailed, specific questions that quantified a baby's functional response to illness gave the most useful information. As a group, the six most common predictive symptoms of serious illness were: taking less than half the normal amount of feed over the preceding 24 hours, breathing difficulty, having less than four wet nappies in the preceding 24 hours, decreased activity, drowsiness, and a history of being both pale and hot. The presence of the corresponding sign on examination increased the predictive value of the symptom by 10-20%. Specific, highly predictive (though less common) signs included moderate to severe chest wall recession, respiratory grunt, cold calves, and a tender abdomen. A list of low, medium, and high risk symptoms has been constructed and the five measurements that were most useful in predicting serious illness in young infants have been detailed.\r"

  ".U": "90351193\r", 
  ".W": "A review of six years' experience with antenatal diagnosis of abdominal wall defects by ultrasound showed its impact to be limited by poor detection rates. Twenty infants with exomphalos and 20 with gastroschisis were recorded but only 25 (63%) were diagnosed antenatally. The ultrasound false negative rate was higher for exomphalos (35%) than for gastroschisis (22%). No difference was detected in the incidence of associated abnormalities, premature gestation, primary closure rate, or mortality between the antenatally and postnatally diagnosed groups for either exomphalos or gastroschisis. Antenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis has little effect on management but allows parental counselling and in utero transfer. The frequency of concomitant abnormalities in exomphalos profoundly affects prognosis and the detection of these is the major role of antenatal diagnosis in this condition. Failure to detect abdominal wall defects by ultrasound may be a reflection of technique or equipment, but some gastroschisis may be of perinatal onset and not detectable antenatally.\r"

One continuous cell line (LC5), derived from embryonic lung, was readily infectable with HIV-1 and showed continuous production of infectious virus. Infection of LC5 cells could be blocked with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. These findings indicate that fibroblasts of skin and lung, and osteogenic cells may be considered as potential target cells for HIV-1, thereby possibly contributing to the establishment of local HIV reservoirs.\r"

The eight constructions elicited anti-LamB antibodies, showing that the hybrid proteins were immunogenic. One of them, LamB-pep8, gave rise to antibodies able to react with gp160 and to neutralize HIV-1 in vitro. We also show that this type of recombinant E. coli can provide a convenient reagent to monitor and characterize specific antibodies. Recombinant clones were used to test sera of seropositive individuals, as well as to narrow down the monoclonal antibody 110-1 recognition site to a cluster of eight residues at the carboxy-terminal end of gp110.\r"

A specific HIV-1 TM sequence, denoted CS3, inhibits T-cell activation in vitro and antibody specific to CS3 has been linked to the absence of disease. CS3, when conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) and labeled with fluorescein, binds specifically to CD4+ cell lines. Cross-linking of CS3-HSA to its binding activity on the CD4+ cell line RH9 reveals a putative subunit size of approximately 44 kD. Incubation of RH9 cells with CS3-HSA prior to addition of HIV-1 prevented HIV-1-mediated cell lysis and inhibited infection. These results suggest that the CS3 region of TM plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the AIDS virus, HIV-1.\r"

This system included sequence analysis of the region coding for the neutralization domain in the third variable region (V3) of the external envelope and of the tat responsive (TAR) region after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of these sequences from cellular DNA in the CBL-4 (RUT) producer line. Based on independent cluster analysis of TAR and V3 sequences the CBL-4 (RUT) virus was positioned closest to the Z6 (and ELI) African virus family. The V3 amino acid sequence on the surface of the virus particle was confirmed by the inhibition of neutralization of CBL-4 (RUT) by a synthetic peptide derived from the nucleic acid sequence. Using antisense phosphate-methylated DNA covering the TAR loop region of LAV-1/HTLV-IIIB, inhibition of HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-IIIRF infection was seen, whereas no inhibition was observed for CBL-4 (RUT), indicating two or more mismatches in the TAR loop region, a characteristic shared with Z6 virus, but not with ELI. We propose a virus-typing system based on sequence analysis confirmed by virus neutralization with a peptide binding antibody and inhibition by antisense phosphate-methylated DNA to group viruses for laboratory use and vaccine design.\r"

We conducted a double-blind, controlled pilot study of hyperimmune bovine colostrum for diarrhea due to cryptosporidiosis in five AIDS patients. The patients were randomized to receive either hyperimmune or control colostrum by continuous nasogastric infusion for 10 days. All stools were collected, graded, and weighed, and the concentration of oocysts excreted was determined daily. One of the three patients treated with hyperimmune colostrum had a reduction in diarrhea and in the concentration of oocysts excreted. A second treated patient had a modest decrease in the concentration of oocysts excreted. Two patients who received control colostrum also had decreases in the volume of diarrhea but no change in the concentration of oocysts excreted. We conclude that hyperimmune colostrum with high titers of specific anti-Cryptosporidium antibody could be effective in treating patients with cryptosporidiosis. However, more studies of cow colostral immunoglobulin need to be performed so that the efficacy of this treatment can be assessed more thoroughly.\r"

Sufficiently defined data were found for comparison of 185 benign adenomas, 76 adenoma-with-carcinomas, and 1333 carcinomas in patients without familial polyposis disease and for 63, five, and 30, respectively, in patients with disease. For patients without polyposis, it was found that (1) 29.8% of all small-bowel adenomas (33.6% if those at Vater's ampulla are excluded) showed malignancy; (2) the mean and median ages were lower for benign adenoma than for adenoma-with-carcinoma and carcinoma, although the ratios by sex were the same; (3) there is a nearly identical spatial distribution of the three types of epithelial neoplasms within the small bowel; and (4) both the frequency of finding adenomatous residues existing in continuity with carcinoma and the life history of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence are similar in the small bowel as in the large. In comparing these results with those from patients with familial polyposis disease, it was particularly noted that (1) the only difference was that adenomas in familial polyposis occurred earlier and multiply, and (2) the spatial distributions of adenomas and carcinomas for both cases were closely similar. It is therefore postulated that the adenoma-carcinoma sequence is as significant in the small bowels as in the large. A hypothesis regarding the relationship of epithelial neoplasms in people with and without familial polyposis disease is suggested.\r"

However, in the junctional nests of dysplastic junctional nevi and junctional components of dysplastic compound nevi, monoclonal anti-S-100 alpha reactivity become more frequent, whereas monoclonal anti-S-100 beta reactivity remains negative. In the superficial variety of melanomas such as superficial spreading melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma, monoclonal anti-S-100 beta is nonreactive until vertical growth or invasiveness begins. Most nodular melanomas are positively stained with both monoclonal anti-S-100 alpha and anti-S-100 beta. It is suggested that monoclonal anti-S-100 alpha can be an indicator of active junctional nevus of melanocytic nevi and the reactivity with monoclonal anti-S-100 beta may be related to vertical progression of superficial spreading melanomas and lentigo maligna melanomas.\r"

Only eight cases of gastric rhabdomyosarcoma have been reported previously and little information is recorded about the behavior of this tumor. Gastric rhabdomyosarcoma has several distinctive clinical features. It is a highly aggressive tumor (median survival, 2.5 months) occurring in both children and adults and frequently presents as metastatic disease to lung or cervical lymph node. The initial diagnosis is often difficult to establish, especially on biopsy material. In several instances, the correct diagnosis was established only at autopsy. The authors' patient was correctly diagnosed during life and received considerable benefit from cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV) therapy and survived for 26 months after diagnosis. Two of the previously reported eight cases of primary gastric rhabdomyosarcoma and this case have adjacent admixed glandular gastric adenocarcinomas. Since three of the nine known cases of primary gastric rhabdomyosarcoma have an adjacent admixed gastric adenocarcinoma, there appears to be a greater than chance association between these two tumors.\r"

A review of the literature revealed that melanin is rarely found in odontogenic lesions. Since the neural crest influence on the development of odontogenic tissues is well established, the occurrence of melanocytes in these tissues is not surprising. A racial predisposition may be present; black patients predominated in the 15 reported cases of melanotic odontogenic lesions.\r"

Some recent reports implicate marijuana smoking as a cause of cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, though most of the subjects were exposed to other, possibly confounding, etiologic factors, namely tobacco and alcohol. We report two cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in men who chronically smoked marijuana but had no other risk factors. The totality of cases may point to a predilection of marijuana smoke for carcinogenesis in the upper aerodigestive tract. This correlates with nonmalignant effects and may be related to a different method of smoking marijuana compared with tobacco.\r"

This study was undertaken to see whether adults with WT have benefited. The results of treatment of 27 adults with WT were reported to the National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) from 1979 to 1987. The ages of the 27 adults ranged from 16 to 74 years (median, 24 years). Four had anaplastic WT, and 23 had favorable histology (FH) WT. All but one patient underwent nephrectomy, 21 were given postoperative radiation therapy, and 25 received chemotherapy. The agents used most often included actinomycin D (AMD), vincristine (VCR), and doxorubicin (Adriamycin; ADR). There were six Stage I, five Stage II, four Stage III, 11 Stage IV, and one Stage V patients. The 3-year survival rate is 67%. These results are better than the 24% reported by the NWTS in the past for adults with WT. Analyses of the therapies given to the 27 adults lead to the following recommendations: for Stage I/FH patients, 6 months of postoperative chemotherapy using AMD + VCR without postoperative radiation therapy; and for Stage II, III, and IV/FH, VCR + AMD + ADR for 15 months + 2000 cGy to the tumor bed, 1200 to 1500 cGy to the lungs, 2000 cGy to the liver, and 3000 cGy to other sites as appropriate in patients with metastases at diagnosis.\r"

The potency of 5FU was dramatically increased as indicated by the observation of dose-limiting leukopenia at less than one tenth the maximum tolerated dose of 5FU when given as a single agent by intravenous bolus technique. Twenty-five percent of gastric cancer patients and 33% of colorectal cancer patients experienced an objective tumor response, including three patients with complete response. However, response duration was brief (median, 6 months), and there were four treatment-related fatalities due to severe and unpredictable leukopenia leading to sepsis. Survival was short with a median of 6 months for gastric cancer patients and 3 1/2 months for colorectal cancer patients. We conclude that therapeutic index of 5FU was not improved by the addition of PALA and thymidine in this patient population based on considerations of objective tumor response rate, patient survival, and toxicity.\r"

Patients received three cycles of VAB-6 every 28 days or four cycles of EP every 21 days. Treatment cycle with either regimen was routinely postponed for 7 days for leukocytes less than 3000/mm3 or platelets less than 100,000/mm3 and then administered regardless of blood count. The number of treatment days was calculated for each patient from initial treatment day to final induction date plus 28 days for VAB-6 and plus 21 days for EP. The proportion of CR and the EFS for good-risk GCT patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were not influenced by a less than or equal to 7-day delay resulting from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Short, planned delays in chemotherapy for good-risk GCT patients (less than or equal to 7 days per cycle) appear to be acceptable since they may prevent serious toxicity in this curable patient population. Delays of longer than 7 days are strongly discouraged except in extraordinary life-threatening circumstances.\r"

In 21% of patients, the reference panel affirmed the diagnosis of soft-tissue sarcoma but disagreed as to type; 7% of patients were ineligible based upon cell type. Of 298 patients evaluable, measurable tumor regression (partial or complete response) occurred in 17% of patients to doxorubicin (70 mg/m2 intravenously) and 18% of patients to doxorubicin (70 mg/m2 intravenously) and vindesine (3 mg/m2 intravenously), each given every 3 weeks. No difference existed in complete response (4% for doxorubicin, 6% for doxorubicin and vindesine) or median survival (9.4 months for doxorubicin, 9.9 months for doxorubicin and vindesine). Overall, 60% of those patients on doxorubicin and vindesine and 46% on doxorubicin experienced a severe or worse toxicity of treatment (P = 0.01).

In nine patients at least one ovary was conserved. Four cases were Grade 1, seven cases Grade 2, and five cases Grade 3. Adjuvant treatment consisted mainly of Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). The chemotherapy regimen appeared to be highly effective because all patients are alive without evidence of disease (median follow-up, 85 months). No severe toxicity was observed. In patients without residual tumor after primary surgery, the authors prefer the adjuvant treatment with Adriamycin because this treatment has a lower toxicity and is as effective as combination chemotherapy (vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide or cisplatin, vinblastine and bleomycin). Some comments on initial surgery and second-look surgery are also given.\r"

In IESS-MD-I, conducted from 1975 to 1977, 53 eligible patients were entered and received the chemotherapeutic agents vincristine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin with concomitant XRT (VACA + XRT). In IESS-MD-II, conducted from 1980 to 1983, 69 eligible patients were entered and received 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in addition to the chemotherapeutic agents of IESS-MD-I; initial intensive chemotherapy was given and XRT was delayed until week 10 (VACA + 5FU, delayed XRT). The best response rate (complete and partial remissions combined) was 73% in IESS-MD-I and 70% in IESS-MD-II, so there was no statistical evidence of a difference in response rates (P = 0.62). The length of best response also was similar between studies (P = 0.79), with approximately 30% of the patients on both studies remaining in remission at 3 years. The percentage of patients surviving 5 years or more was 30 on the first study and 28 on the second study (P = 0.49). The major sites of relapse after a response were lung and bone, each occurring with nearly equal frequency. The age of the patient was related to both best response rate and survival: patients 10 years of age or younger had substantially higher response and survival rates than patients 11 years of age or older. The favorable prognosis for younger patients might be explained by a more favorable distribution of primary sites at diagnosis; 39% of patients 10 years of age or younger had rib primary sites, compared with only 16% for patients older than 10 years of age (P = 0.05). The frequency of life-threatening toxicity was substantially higher in IESS-MD-I (30%) than in IESS-MD-II (9%), but the frequency of fatal toxicity was similar (6% to 7%). Fatal complications included Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, unspecified pneumonitis, and sepsis. The most common toxicity and complications were leukopenia and infections.\r"

Point mutations at K-ras codon 12 were found in all of 18 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and in one bile duct carcinoma, but there were no mutations in the remaining 11 bile duct carcinomas, in all of 9 gallbladder carcinomas, or in two islet cell tumors.

Eighty-eight other patients with vasculitis were ANCA negative, including 7 with microscopic polyarteritis nodosa (MPAN) and 8 with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). Conversely, ANCA were never detected in the absence of vasculitis. Fourteen patients presenting with glomerulonephritis and ANCA were followed for a median of 6.3 years. Eleven patients had MPAN and 3 WG. Remissions were obtained with immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. Clinical relapse was associated with the reappearance of ANCA. Five-year survival was 89% and 5-year dialysis free survival was 77%. ANCA are specific markers for a sub-group of patients with vasculitis and are sensitive markers of disease activity. Glomerulonephritis associated with ANCA positive vasculitis has a favorable outcome with immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

Twenty-two male IDDM patients aged 20-41 yr, 6 of whom had retinopathy, were recruited from the Royal Perth Hospital diabetic clinic. After screening, subjects were divided into three groups. Six of the subjects without retinopathy were randomly selected and allocated to a control group. The remaining 16 patients (10 without and 6 with retinopathy) received a fish oil supplement. All subjects were advised to maintain their usual dietary patterns. Sixteen patients, including the 6 with retinopathy, were instructed to take 15 Max EPA fish oil capsules/day with meals. Patients in the control group did not take Max EPA. Three weeks of Max EPA supplementation without other dietary modification led to a significant rise in total cholesterol (P less than 0.01), which could be accounted for by increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The increase in HDL cholesterol was explained by a 33% rise (P less than 0.001) in its HDL2 subclass. Changes in apolipoproteins were examined and showed that the level of apolipoprotein A-I increased after ingestion of fish oil and correlated significantly (P less than 0.05) with the rise in HDL cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our objective was to determine whether 1) hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSHs), bulking/sweetening agents used in hard candies, produce a diminished postmeal glycemic response relative to glucose in individuals with and without diabetes and 2) any diminished glycemia is secondary to altered carbohydrate absorption. This study followed a randomized double-blind crossover design and was performed in 12 individuals with diabetes (6 non-insulin dependent, 6 insulin dependent) and 6 nondiabetic individuals. Each group consisted of 3 men and 3 women, none with known neuropathy. After an overnight fast, each subject was challenged with 50 g of glucose, HSH 5875 (7% sorbitol/60% maltitol), and HSH 6075 (14% sorbitol/78% hydrogenated maltooligosaccharides)/1.73 m2 of body surface area in random order on 3 successive days. Individuals with diabetes were maintained on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion throughout the study to achieve prechallenge glucose levels between 4.5 and 6.7 mM. For all groups, the order of plasma glucose responses over 5 h postchallenge was glucose greater than HSH 6075 greater than HSH 5875, P less than 0.001 (glucose vs. HSH). Pooled data for all groups for areas under the curve confirmed that HSH 6075 resulted in greater glycemia than HSH 5875 (P less than 0.05). This was reflected in the order of C-peptide responses seen in the nondiabetic and non-insulin-dependent groups (glucose greater than HSH 6075 greater than HSH 5875, P less than 0.001). Breath H2 after glucose was low, whereas HSH 5875 greater than HSH 6075 (P = 0.003). Gastric distress was noticed with all products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of different temporal patterns of calorie intake on plasma glucose, serum insulin, and insulin secretion rates was examined in six patients with moderately well controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Patients were studied on three separate occasions over 26 h. Total calories and food composition (50% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 35% fat) were kept constant, but the pattern of calorie intake was varied. In study A (similar meal size), calories were distributed as 30, 40, and 30% at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively. In study B (3 snacks, 3 meals), each subject ate three meals of 20, 20, and 30% of calories for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively, and three snacks, each comprising 10% of calories, presented 2.5 h after the meal. In study C (large dinner), 10% of calories were consumed at breakfast, 20% at lunch, and 70% at dinner. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations were measured at 15- to 30-min intervals. Insulin secretion rates were calculated from C-peptide levels with individually derived C-peptide clearance parameters. The different eating patterns were associated with only modest differences in overall levels of glucose and insulin secretion. Daytime insulin secretion was lowest when most of the daily calorie intake occurred in the form of a large dinner. Overnight levels of glucose and insulin secretion rates did not differ for the three eating patterns, and the morning glucose levels were also unaffected by the pattern of calorie intake on the previous day. A morning rise of glucose of greater than 0.28 mM occurred consistently only when dinner was of moderate size (30% of total calories).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90353050\r", 
  ".W": "We evaluated the autonomic influence on pregnancy outcome with prospective study of 100 consecutive pregnancies in women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Tests of cardiovascular autonomic nervous function were performed at the beginning of each pregnancy, and two groups were formed. Group 1 was comprised of 23 pregnancies with autonomic dysfunction, and group 2 was comprised of 77 pregnancies with no abnormalities in cardiovascular tests. Elective abortion was later induced for medical reasons in two cases in group 1, and these women were excluded from the study. The groups were comparable with respect to age, duration of diabetes, and presence of nephropathy. Both groups also achieved comparable glycemic control during pregnancy. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in any specific pregnancy complication (spontaneous abortions, 5 vs. 3%; perinatal mortality, 10 vs. 1%; congenital malformations, 10 vs. 4%; respiratory distress syndrome, 5 vs. 8%; preeclampsia, 20 vs. 10%; maternal ketoacidosis, 4 vs. 0%; and maternal hypoglycemic accidents, 10 vs. 4%, respectively), but the frequency of pregnancies with at least one of the above complications was greater in group 1 (52 vs. 23%, P = 0.01). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed the association between autonomic dysfunction and pregnancy outcome to be independent of high initial glycosylated hemoglobin levels, long duration of diabetes, and nephropathy. Maternal autonomic dysfunction seems to be associated with an increased frequency of overall pregnancy complications but does not significantly interfere with the achievement of tight metabolic control during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Currently, there are three markers that are being studied with the potential to give a high positive predictive value for the development of type I diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes caused by autoimmune beta-cell destruction) and that can be utilized to predict the disease in susceptible relatives: 1) high-titer cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies, 2) insulin autoantibodies detected with fluid-phase radiobinding assays, and 3) first-phase insulin release after intravenous glucose less than 1st percentile. With the combination of these assays, it seems to be possible to identify first-degree relatives with a high probability of developing type I diabetes within a limited time span (i.e., less than 10 yr). The ability to predict type I diabetes with selected assays will allow trials for prevention of diabetes and trials to assess whether prediction will decrease morbidity and mortality at onset of diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporin and other immunosuppressive agents have been proposed as a preventive treatment against the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in relatives at increased risk for the disease, based on the understanding that its etiology is an ongoing process of autoimmune beta-cell destruction. We used an epidemiological approach to evaluate several recent trials of cyclosporin in newly diagnosed IDDM patients to determine the degree of benefit that is to be expected. We assessed these and other studies to estimate the potential adverse effects of such treatment, were it to be used in the future, either in newly diagnosed subjects or healthy high-risk relatives. Standard sample-size calculations were used to quantify the number of study subjects necessary to allow adequate statistical power to test the positive and negative effects of a future treatment (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20). The estimates were based on the data available from published studies of cyclosporin treatment. The importance of conducting an adequate trial of such a therapy, both from an ethical and a practical viewpoint, is discussed. Five small immunosuppression trials were evaluated. Remission rates in treated subjects exceeded those in control subjects by 15-59%. Variability in defining remission may account for the differences in rates across the studies. Estimates of the major beneficial and adverse effects of cyclosporin were derived from these trials and studies of patients who have undergone long-term immunosuppression. Indicators of kidney damage associated with cyclosporin treatment were reported in 5-47% of treated subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of hypoaldosteronism in diabetes. Endogenous elevation of plasma renin activity and exogenous corticotropin were used to study steroidogenesis. Observations were made over 12 yr on the evolution and treatment of hyperkalemia in a diabetic subject. In 1977, potassium, baseline cortisol, aldosterone, and renin activity were normal; renin activity increased normally with posture; and cortisol responded normally to ACTH infusion. Nine yr later, persistent hyperkalemia was documented. Upright renin activity was elevated to 5.26 ng.L-1.s-1, with concomitant elevation of 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB) and a low-normal aldosterone level. One hour after administration of 0.25 mg i.m. cosyntropin, cortisol increased normally, aldosterone increased from 220 to 360 pM, and 18-OHB increased from 3700 to 4800 pM. During treatment with fludrocortisone, fludrocortisone with furosemide, and furosemide alone, improvement of hyperkalemia was noted. Endogenous hyperreninemia and basal elevations of 18-OHB, accompanied by limited aldosterone responsiveness to renin and ACTH, suggest the presence of a partial corticosterone methyl oxidase type II defect. Evolution of hyperkalemia between 1977 and 1986 suggests this defect was acquired.\r"

  ".W": "To see whether there are any lipoprotein abnormalities in diabetic patients without hyperlipidemia, lipoprotein composition was examined in 75 strictly normolipidemic diabetic patients. Their plasma cholesterol (chol) and triglyceride (TG) were limited to less than 6.0 and less than 1.7 mM, respectively. Body-weight- and age-adjusted normolipidemic healthy subjects served as the control group. Plasma total chol and TG and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-) chol were identical in the diabetic and control subjects. Total apolipoprotein B (apoB) in the plasma of the diabetic subjects was significantly elevated. The chol-apoB ratio in the TG-rich (very-low-density + intermediate-density) lipoprotein fraction (Sf12-400) of the diabetic subjects was significantly higher than the control value, whereas LDL-apoB levels were increased and chol-apoB ratio in the LDL fraction was significantly suppressed in the diabetic subjects. Because each LDL particle contains only one apoB molecule, apoB and chol-apoB ratio in this fraction can represent particle number and chol loading of the LDL particles, respectively. Thus, these data suggest that LDL particle number is increased, and the particles are chol depleted in diabetic subjects even if they are normolipidemic.\r"

The disease is now known as a commonplace multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomata. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is established by recognizing clinicoradiologic findings and providing histologic evidence of non-caseating granuloma. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels are high in about two thirds of the patients and hypercalcemia is a feature in one of every ten victims of sarcoidosis. Immunologic abnormalities include depression of cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity, accumulation of T-cells at the site of activity, hyperactive B-cells, and the presence of circulating immune complexes. The course and prognosis of the disease usually correlate with the mode of onset. An acute onset with erythema nodosum indicates a good prognosis and spontaneous resolution; whereas, an insidious onset may be followed by relentless, progressive fibrosis. Mortality and morbidity are caused by pulmonary fibrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, neurologic involvement, and blindness. Corticosteroids and chloroquine relieve symptoms and suppress inflammation and granuloma formation.\r"
