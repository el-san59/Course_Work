Angiographic examination suggested that the bleeding was due to ruptured jejunal varices. Treatment by propranolol and a side-to-side portacaval shunt failed to prevent further bleeding. An emergency laparotomy for life-threatening gastrointestinal (GI) rebleeding disclosed dense hypervascular adhesions between the second jejunal loop and the retroperitoneum, and a large submucosal varix of the jejunum that had ruptured. Development of intestinal varices after a Warren operation is facilitated by the persistence of a high pressure in the mesenteric territory and by adhesions between the initial part of the intestine and the area of dissection of the renal vein. This case illustrates one of the possible causes of rebleeding after a Warren operation.\r"

Antibodies raised against these peptides, under reducing conditions, bound to a single protein of m.w. 29,000 found in two actively cytotoxic T cells. This protein was absent from a \"cytotoxic\" T cell line that had lost its cytolytic properties. By using immunocytologic techniques, the protein was localized within cytoplasmic granules. In addition, granules purified from the cytoplasm of cytotoxic T cells were shown, by Western blot analysis, to contain the protein. The molecule detected by the antibodies behaves, upon reduction, similarly to a diisopropylfluorophosphate-binding protein. Thus, here we provide evidence that CCP1, a protein whose expression correlates with cytotoxicity, is contained within organelles which have been implicated in killing. These findings strongly suggest that CCP1 plays a key role in T cell-mediated target cell lysis.\r"

  ".W": "A mitogen derived from the supernatant of broth cultures of Mycoplasma arthritidis (MAS-P) stimulates a proliferative response by normal, unprimed T cells and interleukin 2 production by some, but not all, T cell hybridomas. The response requires an IE-positive accessory cell (AC). The direct participation of IE, and not IA, in this system was confirmed by two sets of experiments. First, L cells transfected with IE, but not IA, provided effective AC function for both normal T cells and the T cell hybridoma DO-11.10. Second, we have taken a more direct approach by showing that purified IE incorporated in liposomes and used to coat glass beads can support the MAS-P response of the DO-11.10 T cell hybridoma in the absence of intact AC or other AC molecules. Although the receptor for IE-MAS-P has not been identified, we have eliminated from consideration two potential T cell recognition structures. Monoclonal antibody to the antigen-major histocompatibility complex specific receptor failed to inhibit the MAS-P response of DO-11.10 or the T cell line LBRM-33. Furthermore, the L3T4 molecule did not appear to be involved since an L3T4-negative variant of DO-11.10 responded well to the mitogen. In addition, we show that both Lyt-2-positive and L3T4-positive T cells respond to this class II-restricted stimulus. Thus, we postulate the existence of a non-T cell receptor, non-L3T4 receptor that recognizes MAS-P in association with a presumed nonpolymorphic region of IE.\r"

It is reported here that some of these effects involve positive or negative signaling induced by cross-linking L3T4 molecules, because such effects are not observed using the Fab fragment of anti-L3T4. However, the Fab fragment does inhibit responses to antigen:self class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and to anti-T cell receptor monoclonal antibodies directed at a particular V region epitope. The finding that the Fab fragment of anti-L3T4, which does not block binding of anti-T cell receptor V region antibodies and does not negative signal can still block activation by such antibodies suggests an intimate association of L3T4 with the T3: alpha: beta T cell receptor complex. This association may normally be induced by interaction of both structures with antigen:self class II MHC complexes. The data also support the hypothesis that cross-linking the L3T4 molecule in the absence of engagement of the T3: alpha: beta complex generates negative or inhibitory signals. Thus, L3T4 plays a central role in the process of class II MHC-restricted T cell antigen recognition and activation.\r"

The addition of TEA and 4AP reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation and lymphokine production to levels observed in unstimulated cells. However, thymidine incorporation by the tumor cell lines P-815 and SP2/0, which replicate autonomously, also was inhibited by these drugs. Treatment of cloned murine helper T lymphocyte, L2, with TEA appeared to inhibit uptake of [3H]thymidine and [3H]phenylalanine after stimulation with interleukin 2. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of the K+ channel-blocking agents TEA and 4AP may not be specific for the sequence of events that are initiated by activation of T lymphocytes through the antigen receptor. Instead, the observed inhibitory effects by these agents may result from inhibition of transport of thymidine, amino acids, and other essential metabolites across the cell membrane.\r"

To explore this question, we have studied several CD3+, CD8+ class I alloantigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines and clones. The ability of these CTL to proliferate as well as to lyse specific targets was inhibited by either anti-CD3 or anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies. Exposure of CTL to relevant but not irrelevant target cells induced the rapid (less than 1 hr) disappearance of approximately 20 to 30% of CD3 and CD8 molecules from the cell surface. The modulation of these molecules became maximal at 6 to 12 hr and recovered thereafter in parallel. Treatment of CTL with anti-CD8 prevented alloantigen-induced modulation of CD3, and treatment with anti-CD3 blocked modulation of CD8. Incubation of CTL with the combination of anti-CD3 and goat anti-mouse Ig also resulted in modulation of CD8. In contrast, the expression of other CTL surface antigens, such as CD2 (Leu-5, T11) and HLA-DR, was not reduced by any of these manipulations. These results suggest that CD8 molecules are associated with the CD3/antigen receptor complex on the surface of CTL, and may play a direct role in antigen-induced modulation and cross-linking of the T cell receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The T cell antigen receptor is likely to play a role in both positive and negative selection in the thymus. Three populations of thymocytes can be distinguished by the level of expression of the CD3-alpha/beta-chain heterodimer of the T cell antigen receptor (CD3/Ti alpha/beta) complex. Cells which fail to express these receptors or express low levels of receptors are contained in a population of thymocytes which express low levels of the CD5 antigen and are predominantly CD4+/CD8+. Thus, these cells appear to be relatively immature phenotypically. In contrast, the cells which express high levels of CD3/Ti alpha/beta co-express high levels of CD5 and are predominantly contained in the more mature single positive cells which express either CD4 or CD8. With the calcium-sensitive dye, Indo-1, and immunofluorescence, we demonstrated that, despite the relative phenotypic immaturity of cells which express low levels of CD3/Ti alpha/beta, these antigen receptors are able to mediate transmembrane signaling when stimulated with CD3 monoclonal antibodies. Although increases in calcium were observed in these CD3/Ti alpha/beta-low expressing cells in response to anti-CD3, no proliferative response was observed, even in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate. Proliferative responses were observed in the more mature cells which express high levels of CD3/Ti alpha/beta. These results suggest that, rather than a defect in the functional capability of the antigen receptor complex to mediate transmembrane signaling events, cellular responses to signals generated by the antigen receptor may differ at various stages of thymocyte development.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous gastric intubation of mice with the T cell-dependent antigen sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) leads to a state of systemic unresponsiveness to parenteral SRBC challenge, a state termed oral tolerance. The systemic unresponsiveness of mice rendered orally tolerant to SRBC, however, is converted to humoral immune responsiveness by adoptive transfer of effector T contrasuppressor (Tcs) cells. In this study, the authors have isolated and characterized the Tcs cell subset, from the spleens of orally immunized mice, which abrogates oral tolerance. This Tcs cell is a novel cell type, which can be separated from functional T suppressor (Lyt-2+) and T helper (L3T4+) cells, and the effector Tcs cell exhibits a Lyt-1+, 2-, L3T4- phenotype. Furthermore, contrasuppression is not mediated by B cells, including those of the Lyt-1+ phenotype. Adoptive transfer of splenic Lyt-1+, 2-, L3T4- T cells from C3H/HeJ mice given oral SRBC for 21 to 28 days and splenic Lyt-1+, 2-, L3T4- T cells of C3H/HeN mice orally immunized for a shorter interval abrogated oral tolerance. Furthermore, separation of Lyt-1+ T cells into L3T4+ and L3T4- subsets by flow cytometry resulted in Lyt-1+, L3T4+ T cells with helper but not contrasuppressor function, whereas the Lyt-1+, L3T4- T cell fraction abrogated oral tolerance even though it was without helper activity. This Tcs cell subset was also effective when added to cultures of tolerized spleen cells derived from SRBC-fed mice. The effector Tcs cells are antigen-specific, because Tcs cells from SRBC-immunized mice reverse tolerance to SRBC but not to horse erythrocytes (HRBC), and Tcs cells from HRBC-immunized mice reverse tolerance to HRBC but not to SRBC. When splenic T3 (CD3)-positive T cells (Lyt-1+, 2-, and L3T4-) were separated into Vicia villosa-adherent and nonadherent subpopulations, active contrasuppression was associated with the T3-positive and Vicia villosa-adherent T cell fraction. Thus, a distinct Lyt-1+, 2-, L3T4- T cell subset that contains a T3-T cell receptor complex, which can regulate oral tolerance, is present in spleens of orally immunized mice.\r"

To date, a number of B lineage restricted and associated activation antigens have been reported that appear at distinct intervals after in vitro activation. In this report, we describe a new B lineage restricted activation antigen (B7) that appears within 24 hr of in vitro stimulation. The expression of B7 antigen, which is detected on a minor subpopulation of B cells isolated from peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues, is strongly induced following stimulation with either anti-immunoglobulin or Epstein-Barr virus. In contrast, B7 was not detected on resting or activated T cells or monocytes. The B7 antigen was expressed on a subset of B cell lines and B cell neoplasms, but was not detected on leukemias and lymphomas of T cell or myeloid origin. B7 was distinguished from other B cell restricted and associated activation antigens by its unique pattern of expression on a variety of hemopoietic cell lines. The biochemical characterization of B7, that it is a single chain protein of 60 kDa, further distinguishes it from other B cell activation antigens. The functional importance of the B7 antigen was demonstrated when splenic B cells were fractionated into the B7+ and B7- populations. The peak of proliferation in response to anti-Ig, appeared earlier within the B7+ population. These studies suggest that B7 antigen identifies a subpopulation of B cells that are preactivated or primed in vivo, and have an accelerated response to subsequent activation via cross-linking of surface Ig.\r"

In this study we investigated the altered production of interleukins in arthritic rats and evaluated the effects of auranofin treatment on disease progression and aberrant interleukin production. The capacity of the AA rat spleen cells to produce interleukin (IL) 2 and IL-3 was found to decrease during the development of the arthritic lesion, with maximum suppression occurring 16 to 17 days after adjuvant injection. In contrast, the production of IL-1 by splenic adherent cells from arthritic rats was markedly increased. Prophylactic treatment of AA rats with auranofin resulted in a slight reduction in paw edema, a complete normalization of the depressed IL-2 production, and a reduction of the elevated IL-1 production, but had no effect on the depressed IL-3 production. In contrast, auranofin administered to normal rats, in the same dosing regimen, did not affect interleukin production. Therapeutic administration of auranofin to AA rats with established disease resulted in normalization of IL-1 production without affecting the suppressed IL-2 and IL-3 levels. In contrast, while indomethacin treatment effectively decreased paw edema, it did not appreciably affect the systemic aberrant interleukin production. Taken together, these results suggest that disease-associated abnormalities in interleukin production may be mediated by different mechanisms with differential sensitivity to the effects of the disease-modifying drug auranofin. Furthermore, defining the relationship between drug-mediated normalization of aberrant immune parameters and clinical improvement will provide a basis for the elucidation of the mechanism of action of disease-modifying antiarthritic drugs as well as for assessment of clinical efficacy of drug treatment.\r"

Local rechallenge with methylated bovine serum albumin several weeks after waning of the joint inflammation caused a flare-up reaction. The inflammations were quantified by a 99mTc-uptake method and examined histologically. The arthritis induced by the cloned T cells showed aspects of a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction characterized by an intense infiltrate which resembles the inflammation in the human rheumatoid joint. The data presented show that joint inflammations can be induced by T cells only and that, after waning, reexposition to the original antigen can induce a flare-up reaction. The data suggest a central role of T cells in the induction and the exacerbations observed in rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

T cells were purified by a four-step procedure, which included depletion of glass-adherent cells, 53% Percoll gradient centrifugation, nylon wool column passage, and treatment with mouse monoclonal antibodies directed to human HLA-DR antigen and Leu M1 antigen plus complement. Purified T cells responded poorly to PHA but with the combination stimuli of PHA and recombinant human interleukin 2 (rIL-2), resting T cells proliferated as well as T cells cultured with 10% monocytes and PHA. But well proliferated T cells in the absence of monocytes expressed very poor DR antigen after 7 to 8 days of culture. DR expression of T cells was restored by the addition of 10% monocytes. Allogeneic monocytes also helped proliferative responses of PHA-activated T cells but did not help the expression of DR antigen. These results suggested that signals required for T cell proliferation (PHA and rIL-2) were not sufficient for DR expression in this system and further monocytes were essentially required in a HLA-restricted manner. In the next experiment, we examined the role of membrane molecules in monocytes for transmission of signals that induce activated T cells to express DR antigen. Autologous monocytes were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and added to T cells in the presence of PHA and rIL-2. Fixed monocytes could help DR antigen expression of PHA-activated T cells as well as viable monocytes. But when fixed monocytes were pretreated with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody, they could not help DR expression of T cells any longer. These results suggested that for the expression of DR antigen, PHA-activated T cells had to first recognize self DR antigen expressed on the surface of monocytes before proliferation occurred.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the antibodies that form glomerular immune deposits in lupus nephritis, immunoglobulin (Ig) was eluted from the perfused kidney cortices of female MLR-lpr/lpr mice with early nephritis. The eluted Ig was predominantly IgG with antibody activity against DNA, multiple polynucleotides, SmRNP, gp70, and levan that was greater than the serum antibody activity of age- and sex-matched mice. Of particular interest, both kidney eluate and serum anti-DNA antibodies were observed to cross-react with multiple polynucleotides; however, only the kidney eluate Ig cross-reacted with phospholipids and RNA. Furthermore, the anti-DNA antibodies in the kidney eluate also cross-reacted with SmRNP and gp70; these ligand-binding properties were shared by the Ig in the kidney eluate that did not bind to DNA; and both kidney eluate fractions shared Id-H130 activity (a high frequency MRL-1pr/1pr idiotype). In contrast, the spectrotypes of Ig in the kidney eluate were found to be similar to serum, and they were observed to be between isoelectric points 6.5 to 7.8. Both the anti-DNA antibodies and the Ig that did not bind to DNA had similar isoelectric points throughout this entire range. These findings indicate that polyreactivity is a distinguishing feature of nephritogenic autoantibodies. They also raise the possibility that these ligand-binding properties influence the capacity of autoantibodies to form immune deposits. This influence could occur because polyreactive antibodies cross-react with antigenic determinants within the normal glomerular capillary wall. Alternatively, polyreactive antibodies may more readily form circulating immune complexes that are, in turn, passively trapped within the glomerulus.\r"

The clone was expanded and maintained with autologous feeder cells, interleukin 2, and a streptococcal antigen. The T8+ clone of cells responded specifically to the streptococcal antigen, in the absence of accessory cells, and released a soluble factor. Both the cloned cells and the corresponding soluble factor expressed augmenting helper but not suppressor activity. The augmenting helper activity for B cell antibody synthesis was demonstrable only in the presence of autologous T4 cells. Although stimulation of the T8+ cloned cells was antigen-specific, the resulting soluble factor elicited nonspecific antibody synthesis in the presence of T4 and B cells. The T8+ cloned cell-derived factor was adsorbed by B cells but not by T4 cells. Preliminary studies suggest that the factor has the properties of a B cell growth factor. We suggest that the T8+ population consists of functionally heterogeneous cell subsets, some that have suppressor function and others that augment the T4+ helper-inducer activity in B cell antibody synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously established subclones from human leukemia-derived HSB.2 cell line that produced high levels of interleukin (IL) 2 when stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and IL-1. Herein, we investigated the signal requirement for IL-2 production, particularly concerning the role of IL-1 in this system. PHA but not IL-1 rendered marked protein kinase C (PKC) activation and IL-2 production induced by PHA plus IL-1 was totally abrogated by a potent PKC inhibitor, H-7. Concomitantly, PHA alone caused marked Ca2+ influx, whereas IL-1 neither induced Ca2+ influx nor augmented PHA-induced Ca2+ influx. As expected, a signal delivered by PHA could be substituted by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin while IL-1 was still indispensable, indicating that at least three signals, i.e., those delivered by IL-1 as well as PKC activation and Ca2+ influx were required for optimal IL-2 production. Kinetic study indicated that while PMA and ionomycin should be added at the initiation of culture, delayed addition of IL-1 up to 4 hr later induced even higher levels of IL-2 production, demonstrating the requirement for IL-1 after PKC activation and Ca2+ influx. In this system, it was revealed that IL-1 was not involved in PKC activation, Ca2+ influx, and breakdown of phosphatidylinositols. Whereas PMA, ionomycin, and IL-1 stimulated high levels of IL-2 production, those combinations of signals did not induce breakdown of phosphatidylinositols. It should be noted that IL-2 production induced by these three signals seemed to bypass hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositols in contrast to PHA plus IL-1 stimulation that was accompanied with a marked breakdown of phosphatidylinositols.\r"

  ".W": "B cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1)/interleukin 4 (IL-4) has striking effects on colony formation in soft agar by small resting B lymphocytes. BSF-1 alone induces colony formation in this cell population, presumably in costimulation with a mitogenic substance present in bacto-agar. In costimulation with anti-IgM antibodies, BSF-1 caused initial proliferation of 8 to 10% of B cells, resulting in a large number of cell clusters (10 to 40 cells/clone) after 3 to 4 days of incubation. However, substantial number of colonies (greater than 40 cells/clone) developed only from these clusters when IL-1 was added to the cultures. Using a modified immunoperoxidase staining technique for the determination of IgM allotype, evidence was obtained that B cell colonies stimulated with BSF-1 are derived from a single progenitor cell. Neutralization of BSF-1 with 11B11 after a culture period of 1 to 4 days inhibits further proliferation of B cell colonies, indicating that the action of BSF-1 extends for several cell generations beyond initial stimulation from the resting state. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the synergistic action of IL-1 with BSF-1 is confined to the late culture period, indicating a growth-promoting effect by IL-1 for activated B cells.\r"

  ".U": "88060421\r", 
  ".W": "Three human leukemia cell lines (TALL-101, AML-193, and MV4-11) that require granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for growth in a chemically defined medium were examined for their response to recombinant human (rh) cytokines. Either rh interleukin (IL)-3 or rhGM-CSF alone supported the long term growth of all three cell lines, and the two growth factors acted synergistically to stimulate the proliferation of the early T lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL-101) and of the monocytic leukemia (AML-193) cells. However, IL-3 antagonized the proliferation of the biphenotypic B-myelomonocytic leukemia (MV4-11) cells in the presence of GM-CSF when both factors were used at very low concentrations. The rh granulocyte (G)-CSF independently supported the long and short term growth of AML-193 and MV4-11, respectively, and synergized with GM-CSF in inducing proliferation of these cells. By contrast, G-CSF did not stimulate TALL-101 cell growth and antagonized the effect of GM-CSF such that proliferation was arrested. Although neither rh macrophage (M)-CSF nor rhIL-1 alpha independently promoted proliferation of the three leukemia cell lines, these cytokines were able to either up- or down-regulate the GM-CSF-dependent growth of these cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that leukemic cells often require the synergistic action of several cytokines for optimal growth, whereas other combinations of factors may be growth-inhibitory. This raises the possibility that multiple hemopoietic growth factors sustain or control leukemic cell proliferation also in vivo. In addition, the observation the G-CSF, M-CSF, and IL-1 alpha can, in some cases, arrest cell proliferation without inducing differentiation suggests that the programs of proliferative arrest and differentiation in leukemic cells can be dissociated.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have previously observed that glucocorticoids dramatically increase the number of interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptors on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (from approximately 100 to 2000 receptors/cell) without significant change in the binding affinity (Kd = approximately 2.6 x 10(-10) M). We, therefore, used such a receptor-enriched glucocorticoid-pretreated PBMC to investigate whether IL-1 induces/increases the phosphorylation of any cell-associated proteins, including possible autophosphorylation of IL-1 receptors. Extraction of 125I-labeled IL-1 alpha cross-linked to IL-1 receptor on steroid-treated PBMC yielded two bands estimated to be 60 and 70 kDa in molecular mass. No molecules were significantly cross-linked with 125I-labeled IL-1 alpha on untreated PBMC. Carrier-free recombinant human IL-1 alpha induced phosphorylation of an acidic 65-kDa protein (pp65) at serine residues within 5 min more effectively in glucocorticoid-treated PBMC than in untreated PBMC. Fractionation of extracts of IL-1-stimulated prednisolone-pretreated PBMC by ultracentrifugation showed that pp65 is located in the cytosol, suggesting that pp65 is not the IL-1 receptor itself. Protein kinase inhibitors, HA1004 and W-7, but not H-7, significantly inhibited the induction of the phosphorylation of 65-kDa protein by IL-1. These data indicate that the glucocorticoid-induced IL-1 receptor is functional and either contains or is closely associated with a serine kinase that is distinct from protein kinase C.\r"

This analysis completes the structural characterization of the six known histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 subtypes. The only detected amino acid change between the main HLA-B27.1 subtype and B27d is that of Tyr59 to His59. Position 59 has not been previously found to vary among class I HLA or H-2 antigens. Such substitution accounts for the reported isoelectric focusing pattern of this variant. HLA-B27d is the only B27 variant found to differ from other subtypes by a single amino acid replacement. The nature of the change is compatible with its origin by a point mutation from HLA-B27.1. Because B27d was found only in American blacks and in no other ethnic groups, it is suggested that this variant originated as a result of a mutation of the B27.1 gene that occurred within the black population.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of membrane and secreted IgM was analyzed during mitogen-induced differentiation of the murine B cell lymphoma CH12. To characterize the Ig genes used by CH12, the nucleotide sequences of the variable gene segments (V mu and V kappa) were determined. The expressed V mu gene segment belongs to the VHII NPb-related family. The D (FL16.1a) and J (JH2) segments are the same as those used by the NP-specific hybridoma B1-8. The V kappa used by CH12 is almost identical to those used by the oxazolone-specific hybridomas NQ5.89.4 and NQ7.7.1. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces up to 80% of CH12 cells to secrete IgM within 48 hr of culture. The steady state levels of secreted mu (mu s) and kappa mRNA increase four to fivefold over this period in cells stimulated with LPS compared with unstimulated cells. The kinetics are similar for both mRNA and parallel the increase in IgM secretion. EL-4 supernatants induce comparable changes in m mu s and kappa transcript levels. The simultaneous increase in m mu s and kappa transcripts suggests that coordinate control of RNA levels is used to increase the synthesis of secretory IgM during differentiation. The level of mRNA encoding the membrane form of mu (mu m) remains constant in stimulated cells and increases slightly in unstimulated cells. While the net rates of synthesis of membrane-bound mu-chains remain similar during LPS stimulation, the level of surface IgM on secreting cells is reduced three to fivefold. These observations suggest that the level of surface IgM expression during differentiation of CH12 is controlled largely by post-translational mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the CH12 cell line regulates the expression of membrane and secreted IgM differently during its differentiation. The changes in IgM expression in CH12 parallel those occurring in normal B cells after mitogen or antigen challenge. Thus, the in vitro differentiation of CH12 is a good model for the analysis of late stages of B cell development.\r"

Normal adult thymocytes were capable of generating LAK upon culture with relatively large doses (500 to 1000 U/ml) of interleukin 2. Normal thymocytes were fractionated into four subsets by virtue of their co-expression of the Lyt-2 and L3T4 markers: Lyt-2+ L3T4+ (2+4+); 2+4-; 2-4+; and 2-4-. None of these subsets had any natural killer activity. Upon examining the ability of these subsets to generate LAK, it was found that the 2-4- subset was the most potent and required the smallest relative amounts of interleukin 2. In addition to lysing tumor cells, thymus-derived LAK were capable of killing \"fresh\" 2+4+ thymocytes. Fresh 2+4-, 2-4+, 2-4-, and cortisone-resistant thymocytes were resistant to lysis by LAK. Upon mitogen stimulation, however, the cortisone-resistant thymocytes and 2+4- thymocytes became LAK-susceptible. These data demonstrate a possible mechanism for the elimination of the 2+4+ thymocyte subset which is generally believed to be a \"dead-end\" population. Moreover, these data suggest a possible biologic role for LAK in the process of thymocyte maturation and intrathymic selection.\r"

The line could help (T,G)-A-L primed B cells in the production of (T,G)-A-L-specific antibodies when stimulated in vitro with either (T,G)-A-L or mAbA-6.

In direct, antigen-specific lysis we always observed an influx of Ca2+ into the CTL concomitant with target cell binding. However, we never observed an increase in CTL Ca2+ content during lectin-mediated lysis, or nonspecific lysis by phorbol myristate acetate-induced CTL. We found that in all three types of lysis (direct, lectin-mediated lysis, C or phorbol myristate acetate-induced) the requirement for Ca2+ in lysis was dictated by the target cell used; the same CTL can kill one target cell in the absence of detectable Ca2+, and absolutely require Ca2+ for the lysis of another target cell. Target cell killing, when it occurred in the absence of Ca2+, was accompanied by microtubule organizing center reorientation in the CTL, showing that this function is not uniformly Ca2+ dependent. These results provide further evidence that Ca2+ is not always required for activation of the lytic pathway in CTL, although Ca2+ may be absolutely required for other CTL functions such as interleukin production or expression of the interleukin 2 receptor.\r"

In such a lytic system anti-Lyt-2 antibody can block cytolysis. We have observed that the amount of inhibition varies considerably from clone to clone and surprisingly correlates well with inhibition of conjugate formation as mediated by bifunctional antibody. This implies that inhibition of antibody-mediated killing occurs as the result of reduction of the avidity of the effector cell for its target, the same mechanism responsible for inhibition of receptor-mediated lysis by anti-Lyt-2. In light of the similarity between the mechanism of inhibition by anti-Lyt-2 of receptor-mediated and antibody-mediated cytolysis, we compared the ability of anti-Lyt-2 to inhibit cytolysis in these two different assay systems by using a number of different CTL clones. Whereas the majority of secondary CTL clones (presumed to have high affinity TcR) are inhibited equally in both assay systems, most primary CTL (presumed to have low affinity TcR) are more susceptible to inhibition by anti-Lyt-2 in their receptor-specific than their antibody-directed cytolysis. These results, taken together with an apparent correlation between the amount of Lyt-2 expressed on the cell surface and susceptibility to inhibition, suggest anti-Lyt-2 may block CTL function by sterically inhibiting mobility of the TcR complex.\r"

  ".W": "The human T cell leukemia (HTLV-1) retrovirus is the etiologic agent for adult T cell leukemia. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) activated killer (AK) cells have been shown to lyse freshly explanted tumor cells in vitro and have been used as a form of adoptive immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. In this report, the ability of AK cells to lyse HTLV-1-infected targets was examined. Normal lymphocytes, when cultured in recombinant IL-2 for periods of 3 to 7 days, killed infected T and B cell lines. The precursor for these AK cells resided in the CD-16 antigen-positive subset (i.e., natural killer (NK) cells). Resting T cells, NK cells, or unfractionated lymphocytes did not lyse the infected targets. However, when isolated NK cells were incubated for 24 hr in IL-2, suboptimal cytolysis was induced whereas activation of NK cells with a four pulse of IL-2 was insufficient to generate effector cells. The results of performing cold target inhibition studies with Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cell lines and HTLV-1-infected T and B cell lines suggest that there are discrete subsets (i.e., clonotypic) in the AK population that preferentially lyse a given virally infected cell line. Thus to consider AK cells as true polyspecific killer cells may be inaccurate. Alternately AK cells may express a number of different receptors with variable affinities for the Epstein-Barr virus- and HTLV-1-infected cell lines. In addition, it was shown that HTLV-1-infected B cells are relatively resistant to AK cell-mediated lysis. These results clearly indicate that AK cells but not resting NK cells kill HTLV-1-infected cells.\r"

  ".W": "Three cell lymphocyte antigens of m.w. 55,000, 70,000, and 105,000 to 110,000 were identified by Western blotting as targets of IgM autoantibodies in serum from a group of 49 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The 55- and 70-kDa antigens were well expressed on unstimulated peripheral T cells, whereas the 105- to 110-kDa target was demonstrable only on mitogen-activated T cells and lymphoblastoid T cell lines. Localization of these molecules to the plasma membrane was established by cytoabsorption experiments in which IgM antibody staining of blotted antigens was specifically absorbed from systemic lupus erythematosus serum during 4 degrees C incubations with intact lymphocytes, and by their detection in purified lymphocyte plasma membranes. While the identity of these target antigens vis a vis known surface determinants was not defined, their expression on peripheral T cells from multiple donors and on cell lines of both undifferentiated (HSB-2) and phenotypically mature (Jurkat; HUT 78) types excluded alloantigens, major histocompatibility complex-encoded determinants, and most T cell differentiation antigens as candidates in this regard. Expression of the IgM autoantibody targets on HSB-2 cells argues against discrete T subset specificities as well. IgM reactivity with the 55-, 70-, and 105- to 110-kDa antigens by blotting was highly correlated with antilymphocyte antibody activity in complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays (Fisher's p less than 0.001), and paralleled flow microfluorimetric and microcytotoxicity quantitation of IgM antibody activity in serial observations of individual patients studied during different phases of disease activity. Taken together, these data suggest that IgM lymphocytotoxic antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus are directed predominantly against a limited number of non-T cell subset-specific antigens.\r"

To determine whether immunoglobulin isotype plays a role in the therapy of EAE with anti-CD4 antibody, an isotype switch variant family of the mouse IgG1 anti-rat CD4 antibody W3/25 was isolated with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2a W3/25 isotype variants all had identical binding capacities for rat CD4+ T cells. Although all three W3/25 isotypes showed some beneficial effects in the amelioration of EAE, the IgG1 and IgG2a W3/25 antibodies were superior to the IgG2b W3/25 in the treatment of EAE. Multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of T cell subpopulations from treated rats showed that none of the antibodies of the W3/25 isotype switch variant family substantially depleted CD4+ target cells in vivo. These experiments demonstrate that immunoglobulin isotype is important in the monoclonal antibody therapy of autoimmune disease. They indicate that therapy of EAE may be successful without a major depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes. Immunotherapy may be optimized by selecting an appropriate isotype of a monoclonal antibody.\r"

The results showed that these T cells could recognize Tg only it it was sufficiently iodinated. Unlike normal mouse Tg, noniodinated mouse Tg was unable to induce significant thyroid lesions but could trigger the production of Tg autoantibodies. In these experiments, the importance of T cell recognition of iodination-related epitopes was emphasized by the inability of serum antibodies to distinguish Tg on the basis of iodine content, whether they were induced with normal or noniodinated Tg. Therefore, thyroid peroxidase-dependent modification of Tg would appear to be central to its recognition by autoreactive T cells and hence its capacity to induce autoimmune thyroid lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells to syngeneic lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice was used to study the maturation of natural killer (NK) cells from their progenitors. The NK progenitor cell was found to be asialomonoganglioside-negative, (aGM1-) Thy-1-, NK-1-, Ly-1-, Ly-2-, and L3T4-. The NK cells emerging from the bone marrow grafts were aGM1+, NK-1+, Thy-1+/-, Ly-1-, Ly-2-, and L3T4- and to have a target specter similar to that of NK cells isolated from the spleen of normal mice. The regulatory role of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interleukin 3 (IL-3) for the maturation of NK cells was examined by exposure of the bone marrow cells to the lymphokines in vitro before bone marrow grafting or by treatment of bone marrow-grafted mice with lymphokines through s.c. implanted miniosmotic pumps. IL-3 antagonized the IL-2-induced maturation of NK cells in vitro and strongly inhibited the generation of NK cells after adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells in vivo. The suppressive effect of IL-3 was evident throughout the treatment period (8 or 16 days) but was apparently reversible because NK activity returned to control levels within 8 days after cessation of treatment. The inhibition of cytotoxic activity was accompanied by a reduced appearance of cells with the NK phenotypic markers aGM1 or NK-1, indicating that not only the cytotoxic activity of NK cells but also their actual formation was inhibited. Concomitantly, a moderate increase in cells expressing the T cell marker L3T4 and an increased proliferative response to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A was observed. A direct estimate of the effect of IL-3 on the frequency of NK cell progenitors was obtained by limiting dilution analysis of bone marrow cells at day 8 after bone marrow transplantation. The estimated minimal frequency of NK cell progenitors was reduced from 1/11,800 in control to 1/41,900 in IL-3-exposed mice. IL-3 may take part in the homeostasis of NK cells by the down-regulation of their progenitors.\r"

Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) shares many biologic properties with IL-1, we have investigated here the role of TNF in the modulation of the immune response. We have thus tested low doses of human recombinant TNF-alpha (hu rTNF-alpha) for its capacity to enhance the in vivo antibody responses evaluated at the cellular level in the hemolytic plaque assay. It was found that hu rTNF-alpha, like human IL-1 beta, is able to enhance the immune response to a T cell-dependent antigen (sheep red blood cells). Interestingly, at variance with human recombinant IL-1 beta, hu rTNF-alpha was not able to enhance the in vivo antibody response to a T cell-independent antigen (type III pneumococcal polysaccharide). These results suggest that low levels of TNF may have a role in the modulation of the immune response in vivo and shed new light on the biologic significance of this mediator.\r"

In the previous report, we describe a factor from the helper T cell line MB2-1 which enhances IgA production. IgA-enhancing factor has been purified from serum-free supernatants of this cell line. The purified lymphokine is a family of microheterogeneous polypeptides presumably modified post-translationally. IgA-enhancing factor has a native m.w. of 45,000 to 60,000 with subunits of between 24,000 and 28,000 under reducing conditions. Upon Edman degradation, a single amino-terminal sequence is detected which is identical to that of the lymphokine interleukin 5. IgA-enhancing factor activity is thus mediated by the same polypeptide that has been characterized as type II B cell growth factor, T cell-replacing factor, and eosinophil-differentiation factor.\r"

  ".W": "The role of mononuclear phagocyte-specific colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) in human monocyte to macrophage differentiation was investigated. The addition of 1000 U/ml of CSF-1 to serum-free monocyte cultures resulted in monocyte survival comparable to that in cultures containing 5% AB serum, whereas cells in serum- and CSF-1-free medium lost their viability in 3 to 5 days. The requirement for CSF-1 coincided with the time (40 to 64 hr of culture) when the major changes in morphology and biochemical function took place in monocytes undergoing differentiation into macrophages. If CSF-1 was removed from the cultures before this time, death of the monocytes resulted. In cultures containing CSF-1, as in serum containing cultures, the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase was enhanced 10- to 20-fold by day 4 to 5. Superoxide production in response to phorbol myristic acetate was maintained in CSF-1 cultured monocytes, but declined with time in monocytes cultured in serum. The expression of monocyte-macrophage antigens p150.95 (LeuM5), OKM1, LeuM3, Fc receptors (32.2), and HLA-DR had increased in CSF-1 containing cultures at day 4. When antigen expression was analyzed at day 2 to 3, when cell size and 90 degrees scatter characteristics were still identical to control serum-free cultures, only p150.95, HLA-DR and FcR expression were enhanced by CSF-1. Low amounts of lipopolysaccharide (0.1 ng/ml) were found to enhance monocyte survival in the absence of added CSF-1. Lipopolysaccharide-containing cultures were found to produce CSF-1 (up to 450 U/ml, as detected by radioimmunoassay). Lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml), however, did not induce enhanced expression of the maturation-related antigens. Based on these observations we conclude that CSF-1 is enhancing human monocyte survival and is involved in the events leading to the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages.\r"

  ".U": "88060474\r", 
  ".W": "Both interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induce increased histamine production by murine hemopoietic cells. Histidine-free culture conditions or addition of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine, an irreversible inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, completely abrogate this phenomenon, indicating that increased histamine levels result from an augmentation of the rate of its synthesis. L-Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) (EC 4.1.1.22) activity is detected in normal bone marrow cell lysates. It is markedly increased following incubation of the cells with IL-3 or GM-CSF. The cells responding by the most important enhancement of HDC activity are located in the less dense layers of a discontinuous Ficoll gradient containing the majority of the hemopoietic progenitor cell types, such as colony-forming units (spleen), granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, and mast cell precursors. In comparison with other HDC-containing cell populations tested, the enzymatic activity contained in these cells is particularly high after IL-3 or GM-CSF treatment and similar to the HDC levels observed in murine fetal liver. The time course of IL-3 and GM-CSF-induced HDC activation at comparable concentrations is slightly different. In response to GM-CSF, HDC activation is more rapid, with a significant enhancement after 4 hr of incubation, as compared with IL-3-induced HDC activation. Moreover, in the latter case the activation increases more progressively up to 48 hr of incubation, whereas GM-CSF-induced increase of HDC activity reaches a plateau more rapidly. In addition, maximal increase in histamine production in response to IL-3 is always higher than in response to GM-CSF. Moreover, the simultaneous presence of both factors at optimal concentration induces only a partially cumulative effect. These results suggest that IL-3 and GM-CSF induce HDC activation in two distinct ways, possibly reflecting the involvement of distinct target cells. However, both mediators act by inducing the transcription of the HDC gene and de novo synthesis of this enzyme since actinomycin D or cycloheximide abolish GM-CSF-or IL-3-induced histamine-producing cell-stimulating activity. This synthesis is independent from cell proliferation as demonstrated by the lack of effect of bone marrow cell irradiation. Finally, the observation that cholera toxin, prostaglandin E2, and N6,2'-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate mimic the effects of IL-3 and GM-CSF on bone marrow cell HDC suggests an involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in factor-induced histamine-producing cell-stimulating activity.\r"

  ".W": "The T200 glycoproteins of T cells were analyzed at different stages of T cell development. Immunoprecipitation and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that Lyt-2-L3T4-, and Lyt-2+L3T4+ thymocytes had similar T200 proteins, whereas Lyt-2+L3T4- and Lyt-2-L3T4+ thymocytes expressed a distinct set of T200 molecules. This result indicated a molecular switch in regulation of T200 protein expression upon differentiation of thymocytes to mature phenotype T cells. Further modifications were evident when the T200 proteins of peripheral T cell subsets were examined. In particular L3T4+ T cells expressed T200 proteins of m.w. 220,000, 200,000, and 175,000, whereas Lyt-2+ lymph node T cells expressed an additional T200 protein of m.w. 235,000. Antigenic differences in the T200 glyco-proteins of peripheral L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ T cells were also detected. The anti-B220 monoclonal antibody, 14.8, reacted with lymph node Lyt-2+ T cells but did not react with lymph node L3T4+T cells or with Lyt-2+L3T4- thymocytes. This finding demonstrated a lineage-specific modification of the T200 protein of Lyt-2+ T cells that occurred after exit of these cells from the thymus into peripheral lymphoid organs. This modification apparently occurred on the m.w. 235,000 and 220,000 proteins since these species were precipitated by 14.8, whereas the others were not. In vitro growth and activation also resulted in further T200 antigen alterations. The monoclonal antibody, RA3, which reacts with the B220 antigen of B cells but, unlike 14.8, does not react with any peripheral T cells, showed significant reactivity with Lyt-2+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones but not with L3T4+ T helper cell clones. CTL clones were also 14.8+ but T helper cell clones were not. Immunoprecipitation by 14.8 and RA3 of T200 proteins from CTL clones yielded a single protein of m.w. 240,000 that co-migrated with the B cell form of T200. Overall, the results indicate the presence of developmentally regulated mechanisms that control T200 glycoprotein expression during T cell differentiation in the thymus and in peripheral lymphoid organs.\r"

In order to generalize this study we have examined the binding reaction for a number of different anti-dsDNA Ab (from systemic lupus erythematosus plasmas), complement sources, RBC donors, and dsDNA sizes. The affinity of the IC for the RBC is quite high, and the Ka values fall within a narrow range (5 to 14 X 10(10) liter/mol). Similarly, the limiting stoichiometries for the number of IC bound per RBC were between 40 and 91. The very high affinity and limiting stoichiometries both suggest that the IC bind to the RBC via multiple contacts with clusters of complement receptor type 1 (CR1). Furthermore, we have used three specific monoclonal AB (mAb) to quantitate CR1 on human RBC in the presence and absence of bound IC. One of these Ab, mAb 1B4, is blocked from binding to the RBC if IC are previously bound, and we have used this observation to verify the multivalent nature of the interaction of complement-fixing IC with CR1 on human RBC.\r"

In the present study, T lymphocyte clones were randomly established from the blood of a patient with HES and propagated in culture with mitogen and interleukin 2. Whereas 28 of 29 clones were able to stimulate myeloid colony formation when co-cultured with normal bone marrow cells in a double-layer micro-agar culture system, one third of these clones preferentially stimulated pure eosinophil colonies (up to 98% of all colonies). This pattern differed markedly (p less than 0.001) from the pattern of release of hemopoietic factors by 126 T cell clones established from four other individuals. Eosinophil colony stimulation was due to the release of a lineage-specific eosinophilic colony-stimulating factor (Eo-CSF) by these clones after appropriate stimulation. Production of Eo-CSF in vitro was inhibited by hydrocortisone or cyclosporin A. All Eo-CSF-producing clones had the T4+8-phenotype and were capable of producing in addition interleukin 2 and interferon-gamma. Southern blot analysis of the T cell receptor beta-chain rearrangement of the Eo-CSF-producing clones showed a different rearrangement pattern for each clone. These studies suggest a reactive T cell-mediated eosinophilia as the pathogenetic mechanism in this case of HES and, for the first time, point to a biologic relevance of a lymphokine-induced stimulation of hemopoiesis.\r"

In these studies the effects of both cholera toxin (CT) and its purified binding subunit (CT-B) on lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was examined, using a variety of cell activators. We found that both CT and CT-B inhibited mitogen- and antigen-induced T cell proliferation and anti-IgM-induced B cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. However, only CT-inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced B cell proliferation. Neither CT nor CT-B inhibited antigen uptake and presentation by macrophages. The CT-B preparation used was shown not to activate lymphocyte adenylate cyclase, although CT itself was a strong activator of this enzyme. Both molecules had to bind to the lymphocyte surface in order to inhibit. The time course of inhibition of both CT and CT-B was similar in that either could be added up to 24 hr after culture initiation and still inhibit substantially. The addition of excess human recombinant interleukin 2 to the cultures did not affect the inhibition by CT, and had only a partial affect on inhibition by CT-B. Similarly, CT was able to substantially inhibit recombinant interleukin 2-dependent T lymphoblast proliferation, whereas CT-B had only a small inhibitory effect. Inhibition was not major histocompatibility complex-restricted. We conclude that the binding of CT or CT-B to the lymphocyte surface membrane interferes in some way with the activation mechanism leading to proliferation. The inhibition mediated by CT-B does not involve the stimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase. CT appears to inhibit both by binding via its B subunit and by activation of adenylate cyclase via its A subunit.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA clone encoding human thymosin-beta 4 was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes of a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia. This clone contained the entire coding sequence of 43 amino acid residues of thymosin-beta 4 and had an initiation codon and two termination codons. The amino acid and nucleotide sequences in the coding region were well conserved between rat and human. Nine of 132 nucleotides were different in the coding sequences (93% homology), but the deduced amino acid sequences were identical. No signal peptide was found in the deduced protein sequence. Human thymosin-beta 4 mRNA, approximately 830 nucleotides in length, was about 30 nucleotides larger than rat thymosin-beta 4 mRNA. Expression of the human thymosin-beta 4 gene in various primary myeloid and lymphoid malignant cells and in a few human hemopoietic cell lines was studied. Northern blot analyses of different neoplastic B lymphocytes revealed that steady state levels of thymosin-beta 4 mRNA varied as a function of differentiation stage. Thymosin-beta 4 mRNA levels were decreased in myeloma cells as are class II human leukocyte antigen, Fc receptor, and complement receptor, suggesting a relationship between thymosin-beta 4 and the immune response. Thymosin-beta 4 mRNA was more highly expressed in mature granulocytes than in immature blastic cells. Treatment of THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, with recombinant human interferon-lambda reduced the levels of thymosin-beta 4 mRNA. Its level decreased after differentiation of THP-1 cells into Ia+ macrophages, but increased after differentiation of HL-60 cells into Ia- macrophages. The pattern of thymosin-beta 4 gene expression suggests that it may play a fundamental role in the host defense mechanism.\r"

All of the transgenic Dd mouse strains were found to be tolerant for the Dd antigen. Spleen cells from transgenic mice were immunocompetent but consistently failed to generate an anti-Dd cytotoxic T lymphocyte response in vitro, and skin grafts between transgenic Dd mice were not rejected. These data suggests that the Dd antigen was recognized as a self molecule. In addition, the transgenic Dd mice generated antigen-specific Dd-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte, indicating that the Dd antigen also functioned as a restriction element for antigen recognition. These observations demonstrate the usefulness of the transgenic mouse system for studying class I antigen expression and function.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency and phenotype of human T cells that mediate major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted cytolysis were analyzed. T cell clones were generated by culturing adherent cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells at a density of 0.3 cell/well with phytohemagglutinin, recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2), and irradiated autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells and/or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. These conditions were shown to expand a mean of 96% of cells cultured. All of the 198 clones generated by this method were T cells (CD2+, CD3+, CD4+ or CD2+, CD3+, CD8+) that possessed potent lytic activity against K562, an erythroleukemia line sensitive to lysis by human natural killer cells, and Cur, a renal carcinoma cell line resistant to human natural killer activity. Cytolysis was MHC-unrestricted, since the clones were able to lyse MHC class I or class II negative targets, as well as MHC class I and class II negative targets. In addition, the activity was not inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against class I or class II nonpolymorphic MHC determinants. Killing, however, was inhibited by soluble monoclonal antibodies against the CD3 complex. Although the clones produced tissue necrosis factor/lymphotoxin-like molecules, lysis of Cur or K562 was not mediated by a soluble factor secreted by the clones. Some of the clones retained their cytotoxic activity when grown in rIL-2 alone for 4 to 6 wk, whereas others exhibited markedly diminished cytotoxicity after maintenance in this manner. Clones that exhibited diminished or no cytotoxic activity after prolonged maintenance in rIL-2 could be induced to kill by stimulation with immobilized but not soluble monoclonal antibodies to CD3 in the absence of lectin. All of the clones examined expressed NKH1 and CD11b but none were CD16 positive. The degree of cytotoxicity of resting or activated clones could not be correlated with expression of these markers. These data indicate that the capacity for MHC-unrestricted tumoricidal activity and expression of NKH1 and CD11b, but not CD16, are properties common to all or nearly all human peripheral blood-derived T cell clones regardless of CD4 or CD8 phenotype.\r"

These results showed that ganciclovir inhibits lymphocyte functions for which lymphocyte proliferation is required but does not affect lymphocyte responses that do not require DNA synthesis. Studies of the effect on the immune responses in patients receiving ganciclovir will be needed to determine in vivo correlates of these findings.\r"

The specimens were analyzed by a novel hybridization method termed reverse blotting, in which cellular DNA is radiolabeled and used to probe a battery of cloned HPV DNAs immobilized on nitrocellulose. Reconstruction experiments demonstrated that this method could detect about one HPV genome equivalent per cell. HPV DNA sequences were detected in 52 (96%) of 54 patients who showed either condylomatous changes or dysplasia by cervical biopsy. HPV-16 was most commonly detected overall and was detected in 61% of moderate or severe dysplastic samples. HPV DNA was also detected in seven of 12 cervical scrapes from women with a history of dysplasia but with either normal or inflammatory changes noted on cervical biopsy. Our results indicate that the reverse-blot method can detect DNA homologous to various HPV types in a single experiment using DNA from the small numbers of cells obtained by cervical scraping.\r"

Isolates exhibited a single pattern of resistance, with large zones of inhibition by disk diffusion and low MICs by broth and agar dilutions only to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime, Augmentin, and Timentin. All strains produced beta-lactamase, with five different enzyme patterns by isoelectric focusing. Despite the differences in their isoelectric points, the enzymes had the same substrate profiles, with equivalent activity against penicillin, ampicillin, cefamandole, cephalothin, and cephalordine. In an in vitro assay, the enzymes were highly susceptible to clavulanic acid. The MIC50 and MIC90 for the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (Augmentin) was 2 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared with 16 micrograms/ml for both values for amoxicillin alone. These studies suggest that beta-lactamase is the major mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in this species and that Augmentin is the first oral beta-lactam with good potential for treating infections due to N. brasiliensis.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of fibronectin as a molecular anchor for fibrin to ground substance, the ability of factor XIII to cross-link fibronectin to fibrin, and the demonstrated differences between purified fibrin and fibrin formed in plasma prompted this study of the effect of both proteins on fibrin assembly and structure. The influences of activated factor XIII (FXIIIa) and fibronectin were studied by use of turbidity techniques. Fibronectin over a concentration range of 0 to 800 micrograms/ml produced no change in either the mass-length ratio or density of fibrin fibers in 1 mg/ml fibrin gels. FXIIIa at concentrations as high as 6.5 mumol/L, although not altering fiber mass-length ratio, caused a 30% increase in fiber density. Gels formed in the presence of fibronectin plus FXIIIa demonstrated increasing fiber mass-length ratios and increasing fiber density with increasing fibronectin concentration. Mass-length ratios for gels formed in the presence of 3.24 mumol/L FXIIIa increased from 3.25 to 5.20 x 10(13) daltons/cm as the fibronectin concentration increased from 0 to 800 micrograms/ml. Fiber density increased from 13.6 to 19.1 x 10(22) daltons/cm3 over the same fibronectin range. These results imply that FXIIIa-induced structural changes such as increased elastic modulus may be mediated in part by increased fiber density. Fibronectin alone has virtually no impact on fibrin assembly, but in the presence of FXIIIa becomes incorporated into fibrin and results in increased fiber size and density.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the membrane events that take place during red blood cell shape change, the deformability of resealed ghosts was studied in the ektacytometer while alterations in ghost shapes were produced. By studying ghosts in the ektacytometer it is possible to assess small changes in membrane dynamic rigidity free of the complicating factors that exist in intact red blood cells, such as concerns over the ratio of surface area to volume and the internal viscosity. Ghosts resealed in isotonic buffers are echinocytic, but addition of magnesium-adenosine triphosphate converts them to discocytes. This conversion to discocytosis was accompanied by an increase in membrane rigidity. Addition of vanadate along with magnesium-adenosine triphosphate blocked the conversion of echinocytic ghosts to discocytes, and in parallel blocked the accompanying increase in rigidity. Monospecific rabbit antispectrin antibody was resealed within ghosts and produced the anticipated increase in membrane rigidity. Morphologic evaluation revealed that such ghosts had changed from echinocytes to discocytes. Therefore two very different methods were used to convert normally echinocytic ghosts into discocytic ghosts, and in both cases the shape change was accompanied by an increase in ghost rigidity. These experiments indicate that in isotonically resealed ghosts, the discocytic shape is achieved as a consequence of membrane protein changes that produce an increase in membrane rigidity.\r"

Since dCF is relatively nontoxic to hematopoietic stem cells, we tested dCF for utility in the ex vivo purging of malignant T lymphoblasts from remission leukemic bone marrow for autologous bone marrow transplantation. We found that T lymphoblast cell lines were sensitive to dCF (plus deoxyadenosine [dAdo]) under conditions that did not ablate human hematopoietic colony-forming cells. Moreover, combined pharmacologic (dCF plus dAdo) and immunologic (anti-T cell monoclonal antibodies [McAb] plus complement) purging resulted in additive reduction in clonogenic T lymphoblasts.

Patients were leukapheresed and cells cultured for three to four days in rIL-2. rIL-2 cultured cells from all patients demonstrated cytotoxic activity. In order to characterize the effector cell, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells were isolated to greater than 95% purity by flow cytometry. Cytotoxic activity was mediated by rIL-2--activated NK cells, whereas T cells demonstrated no substantial activity. The circulating in vivo cytotoxic effectors detected after in vivo rIL-2 therapy were also shown to be rIL-2--activated NK cells.

The results further demonstrate the existence of a dose-response relationship between these supernatants and inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte activation. Maximum production of suppressive activity by glial tumor cells was dependent on: 1) the number of tumor cells seeded in culture, 2) whether fetal calf serum was present, and 3) the duration of culture. The production of the suppressive factor(s) was not inhibited by the addition of inhibitors of prostaglandin E synthesis. Experiments designed to determine at what time during lymphocyte activation the suppressive factor was most effective demonstrated that the culture supernatants must be added during the first 24 hours of culture to exhibit inhibitory properties. Finally, proliferation of both the T-helper and T-suppressor/cytotoxic subsets was equally well inhibited by the glial tumor cell culture supernatants.\r"

In two patients injected with both 131I-OC-125 F(ab')2 and 125I-NS F(ab')2 (nonspecific immunoglobulin) 1 and 4 days before tumor resection, tumor uptake of the specific antibody was 2.2 and 4.5 times greater than that of NS. Immunoscintigraphic results were complementary with those of ultrasonography and computed tomography. Finally, in one patient injected successively with 131I-OC 125 F(ab')2 and 111In-DTPA-OC 125 F(ab')2, the recurrent tumor was visualized with both radionuclides, with 111In providing better abdominal tumor contrast but causing much greater liver radioactivity than 131I.\r"

For the noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion, dipyridamole-redistribution 201Tl emission computed tomography (ECT) was performed in seven children (age 2 8/12-8 7/12 yr) 3-20 mo after the acute stage of the disease. In all patients, coronary aneurysms had been demonstrated by cross-sectional echocardiography. The scintigrams of six children showed no significant regional reduction of myocardial thallium uptake. These children had remained asymptomatic since the acute stage of Kawasaki disease. Persistent and transient thallium defects were present in one child with documented myocardial infarction. For this patient, obstruction of corresponding coronary vessels was confirmed by contrast angiography. It is suggested, that 201Tl ECT after dipyridamole-induced vasodilation may be used as a safe alternative to invasive coronary angiography for follow-up investigations in patients with Kawasaki disease.\r"

Energy spectra were recorded from 24 positions around the object and convolved with Gaussian functions to simulate data that would have been acquired with a scintillation camera. The scatter fraction was computed from the convolved spectra in conjunction with a scatter-free reference spectrum. After adding appropriate Poisson noise, a technique based on maximizing the signal to noise ratio was developed to optimally subtract the scatter fraction from the recorded counts. SPECT imaging of the test object was performed to evaluate the correction technique.\r"

Both the amplitude A and the slope B of this function, were approximately invariant with source position except near phantom surface. The accuracy of the 2-D correction technique was compared with that of the previous one-dimensional (1-D) scatter correction technique. As could be expected the latter technique was shown to be less accurate due to its dependence on axial distribution of radioactivity. Phantom SPECT studies showed a clear superiority of the 2-D over the 1-D scatter correction in quantitative imaging. Images derived from clinical studies of regional bloodflow with 99mTc-HM-PAO and liver uptake showed significant contrast improvement by both techniques.\r"

The TCA reconstructions of patient data confirm the good performance observed in the phantom studies and demonstrate a high degree of lesion detectability. The TCA also provides higher efficiency and shorter imaging times than the 7P collimator. It is therefore concluded that TCA imaging is a promising alternative to multiple view pinhole imaging of the thyroid.\r"

The results of cell crossover experiments revealed that the observed depression in T-cell proliferation in the ZD mice was indirect and due to a primary defect in the macrophage population that could be overcome by increasing the proportion of macrophages in culture. In contrast, the proliferative capacity of purified T-cells from ZD mice was not different from control levels when the cells were combined with macrophages from PF control mice. Similar results were obtained in neonatally thymectomized ZD and PF mice, suggesting that long-lived T-cells may have been processed normally through the thymus before the 6 wk of dietary zinc deprivation. After 12 wk of zinc depletion, however, the proliferative capacity of T-cells from ZD mice was significantly depressed, suggesting a direct effect on the maintenance or maturational state of T-cell subpopulations when the period of deficiency approached the half-life of these cells. These results emphasize the continuum of immunologic alteration with progressive nutritional intervention, which may vary depending on the age of induction and the duration of depletion.\r"

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), having the human/rat 41-amino acid sequence, was efficacious in reducing these indices of thermal injury. Injected i.v. at microgram doses or intradermally at nanogram doses, it inhibited the protein extravasation and edema produced by heat. The intradermal median inhibitory dose (ED50) of CRF against protein extravasation elicited by 48 degrees C water was 21.8 times lower than the i.v. ED50, indicating that CRF's actions occurred locally in the paw skin. Ovine-CRF and dynorphin A(1-13) injected i.v. inhibited the protein extravasation and edema induced by 58 degrees C water, but morphine, ethylketocyclazocine and FK 33,824 (a stabilized enkephalin analog) were not active at this temperature.

When PC12 cells were exposed to muscarine the cells responded rapidly with elevation of cellular inositol trisphosphate levels, elevation of intracellular free Ca++ and release of stored transmitter. These three phenomena were totally inhibited by the muscarinic antagonist, atropine, but were unaffected by the nicotinic antagonist, d-tubocurarine. Muscarine did not stimulate the production of cyclic GMP in these cells. The muscarine-stimulated increases in inositol trisphosphate, intracellular free Ca++ and neurotransmitter release displayed similar time courses and concentration dependencies suggesting that the secretion observed may be associated with the formation of inositol trisphosphate and elevation of intracellular free Ca++. The increase in intracellular free Ca++ appeared to be due to a mobilization of Ca++ from intracellular stores inasmuch as the increase in intracellular free Ca++ was not inhibited by the voltage-dependent Ca++ channel antagonist, nifedipine, at concentrations demonstrated to block K+-induced Ca++ influx into the cells, and little or no uptake of 45Ca++ was noted when cells were stimulated with muscarine. Elevation of inositol trisphosphate, intercellular free Ca++ and stimulation of transmitter release were, however, inhibited by the absence of extracellular Ca++. The results suggest that muscarine-stimulated release of neurotransmitter may be associated with an inositol trisphosphate-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca++.\r"

The effects of CsA on resorption were maintained over 72 h of culture with parathyroid hormone or prostaglandin E2 with no evidence of \"escape\". Removal of CsA from the cultures resulted in recovery of the resorptive response after a 24-h delay. CsA did not affect thymidine incorporation into DNA in the calvaria. Our results demonstrate that CsA is a nonselective antiresorptive agent in bone, with actions that differ somewhat from those of calcitonin. The results confirm and extend our previous findings on effects of CsA in fetal rat limb bones, with the exception that the inhibitory effects of CsA were more rapidly and completely reversible in the limb bone system.\r"

CCh caused a concentration-dependent accumulation of IP3 (EC50 = 2.3 X 10(-6) M), MLC phosphorylation (EC50 = 3.8 X 10(-6) M), contraction (EC50 = 0.55 X 10(-6) M) and [3H]QNB displacement [KH (high affinity dissociation constant) = 2.9 X 10(-6) M]. The time course of atropine reversal of CCh-induced IP3 accumulation and muscle contraction revealed that the continued presence of activated muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was required to maintain IP3 production and contraction. Atropine was about 2 orders of magnitude more potent than PZ in inhibiting the CCh-induced biochemical and pharmacological responses and [3H] QNB binding, indicating the preponderance of M2 receptors in this smooth muscle. Thus, the PA2 values for atropine antagonism of CCh-stimulated IP3 accumulation, MLC phosphorylation and contraction were 9.1, 9.05 and 9.39, respectively, and for PZ antagonism were 7.12, 7.10 and 7.29, respectively.

In the skinned muscle fibers treated with 50 micrograms/ml of saponin, MCI-154 shifted the -log[Ca++]M-tension relation curve to the left and upward in the concentration-dependent manner (10(-7) to 10(-4) M). This was confirmed also in the skinned muscle fibers treated with 250 micrograms/ml of saponin which destroyed not only the surface membrane but also the function of SR. Sulmazole (10(-4) M) shifted the -log[Ca++]M-tension relation curve to the left but the effect was about 100 times less potent than that of MCI-154. Unlike MCI-154, sulmazole had little effect on the maximum tension development induced by -log[Ca++]M 4.4. Milrinone did not affect the Ca++-induced tension development in the skinned cardiac fibers. Higher concentration of MCI-154 (10(-4) M) also increased amplitude of -log[Mg-ATP]M-tension-curve in the absence of free Ca++ ion (bell-shaped curve) to the upward. Initial rate and plateau phase of Ca++ uptake by the SR in the skinned fibers treated with 50 micrograms/ml of saponin was increased slightly by MCI-154 at the concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-4) M. MCI-154 had no effect on the Ca++-induced Ca++ release mechanism in the SR. These results suggest that an increase in Ca++ sensitivity of the contractile protein system is responsible for, at least in part, the mechanism of the positive inotropic action of MCI-154.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the presence of atenolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), prazosin (alpha adrenoceptor antagonist) and atropine (muscarinic antagonist), transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) elicited a positive inotropic response which was slow in both onset and decay. Inasmuch as this TNS-induced positive inotropic response was abolished by tetrodotoxin, it can be considered that the response was mediated by intracardiac NANC nerves. Numerous CGRP-like immunoreactive nerves were detected in the left atrium. Exogenously applied CGRP produced a positive inotropic response in a dose-dependent manner. Neither substance P nor vasoactive intestinal polypeptide exerted a positive inotropic effect. CGRP-like immunoreactive nerves and the TNS-induced NANC response was not affected by surgical sympathectomy of the heart or reserpine pretreatment but were specifically abolished by the pretreatment of animals with capsaicin. These results suggest that CGRP is the potential neurotransmitter of NANC nerves in the left atrium of guinea pigs.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of the twitch potentiating action of pumiliotoxin-B (PTX-B), an indolizidine alkaloid from the skin of the frog Dendrobates pumilio, was studied on frog skeletal muscles. In the presence of PTX-B, a single stimulus to the muscle produced either a burst of repetitive action potentials superimposed on a depolarizing afterpotential or a single potential with a prolonged afterpotential at junctional as well as extrajunctional regions of the frog skeletal muscle fibers. The alkaloid did not cause repetitive activity in quiescent cells or spontaneous contractions. The duration of the burst of action potentials was related inversely and the amplitude and duration of postburst depolarizing after-potential was related directly to the concentration of PTX-B. The typical pattern of repetitive action potentials and postburst depolarization induced by PTX-B could be mimicked by depolarizing the muscle membrane with current pulses of long duration (150-470 ms). Lowering the external calcium or sodium concentration reduced the ability of PTX-B to initiate repetitive action potentials, whereas a low external chloride concentration had no effect. The frequency of MEPPs evoked by potassium, but not the spontaneous MEPP frequency, was increased by PTX-B, suggesting a selective effect on evoked transmitter release. PTX-B evoked repetitive EPPs in response to a single stimulus applied to the nerve, which was dependent upon the external calcium ion concentration. The amplitudes of EPPs in the train were facilitated, and their amplitude increased linearly at the lowest calcium concentration, but not at concentrations from 0.45 to 1.8 mM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, the antigenic phenotype and target cell specificity of the cytotoxic lymphocytes observed in F344 rats following the ip inoculation of a syngeneic MADB106 mammary carcinoma and the single injection of OK-432 were examined. When the cytotoxicity of peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) was measured in a 4-hour 51Cr release assay, appreciable cytotoxicity against MADB106 tumor cells was evident by day 7-14 following OK-432 injection. With the use of an antibody (R1-3B3) and complement depletion of cytotoxic PECs, the MADB106 killer cells appeared to consist of both R1-3B3- (non-T) and R1-3B3+ (T) cells, with most of the anti-MADB106 killing residing in the R1-3B3- cell population. The R1-3B3- killer cells were further defined as: a) phenotypically asialoGM1+, b) present in athymic nude rats, and c) accompanied by some augmentation of YAC-1 killing [the prototype rat natural killer (NK) target], suggesting that some of these R1-3B3- killer cells were typical NK cells. However, it was also observed that most of the R1-3B3- cells that killed MADB106 tumor cells were: 1) phenotypically or functionally different from either cytotoxic T-cells or typical NK cells; 2) observed only in MADB106 tumor-bearing rats challenged with OK-432; 3) not present on day 1-2 following OK-432 injection, the time when YAC-1 killing was maximally augmented; and 4) present in high numbers in a secondary response following reinoculation of the MADB106 tumor cells into cured rats. The in vivo relevance and possible derivation of these various cytotoxic lymphocyte populations in the syngeneic tumor-bearing hosts are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A method was described for the generation of cells from tumor-bearing mice; these cells were capable of exhibiting significant antitumor reactivity when adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing hosts. Tumor cell suspensions from a variety of tumors were able to be separated using enzymatic techniques and they were cultured in medium containing recombinant interleukin-2. Activated infiltrating lymphocytes within these tumors expanded; and, by 6-8 days after initiation of culture, lymphocytes predominated and were able to grow to large numbers. The adoptive transfer of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) made possible mediation of the reduction of established 3-day pulmonary micrometastases from 5 of 7 tumors tested, including two 3-methylcholanthrene (CAS: 56-49-5)-induced sarcomas, one 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (CAS: 540-73-8)-induced colon carcinoma, and the B16 melanoma, all in C57BL/6 mice, as well as the 1660 bladder carcinoma in BALB/c mice. Approximately 2-4 X 10(6) transferred cells were capable of totally eliminating 3-day established metastases. These cells were thus 50 to 100 times more effective than lymphokine-activated killer cells in reducing established metastases; however, they could not be generated from all tumors. The concomitant administration of recombinant interleukin-2 enhanced, by approximately fivefold, the in vivo activity of these cells. The specificity of action of TILs in vivo was different from that determined by classic amputation rechallenge experiments. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that developed this antitumor reactivity appeared to be Thy-1+ and did not bear the asialo GM1 antigen. The potent antitumor effect of these TILs, when transferred in vivo to tumor-bearing hosts, raises the possibility of utilizing similar approaches for the isolation and therapeutic use of lymphocytes with antitumor reactivity from human tumors.\r"

  ".U": "88063776\r", 
  ".W": "The A-chain of the plant toxin abrin was covalently linked to monoclonal anti-Thy 1.1 antibody (OX7) with the use of either N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) or 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride (2IT). The SPDP reagent generates a linkage containing a disulfide bond and an amide bond, whereas the 2IT reagent generates a linkage containing a disulfide bond and an amidinium bond. The two immunotoxins were powerfully and specifically toxic to Thy 1.1-expressing murine AKR-A lymphoma cells in vitro. Both reduced the rate of protein synthesis of the cells by 50% at a concentration of 10(-11) M. However, clonogenic assays revealed that about 1% of the AKR-A cells survived treatment with high concentrations of OX7-SPDP-abrin A, whereas only about 0.1% survived treatment with similar concentrations of OX7-2IT-abrin A. Several clones of the surviving cells were isolated. Of 11 clones of cells that had survived exposure to OX7-SPDP-abrin A, 10 were resistant to further treatment with OX7-SPDP-abrin A but had normal sensitivity to OX7-2IT-abrin A. These clones expressed moderate to high levels of the Thy 1.1 antigen and were fully sensitive to abrin. In contrast, all 10 clones of cells that had survived exposure to OX7-2IT-abrin A were substantially or entirely resistant to both immunotoxins. They expressed low to high levels of the Thy 1.1 antigen and were fully sensitive to abrin. The 2IT-linked immunotoxin was much more effective than the SPDP-linked immunotoxin at protecting nu/nu mice against the growth of AKR-A lymphoma cells in the peritoneal site. A single iv injection of 0.3 nmol OX7-2IT-abrin A eradicated at least 99.99% of the tumor cells, as judged from the extension in the median survival time of the animals, whereas OX7-SPDP-abrin A eradicated only about 99% of the cells. The tumors that developed in the animals that received OX7-2IT-abrin A were Thy 1.1-negative, whereas those in the recipients of OX7-SPDP-abrin A generally expressed normal levels of the Thy 1.1 antigen. The difference in antitumor activity of the immunotoxins was not due to differences in their in vivo fate, inasmuch as they were cleared from the bloodstream at an identical rate and broke down at the same rate to release free antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An immunoconjugate was prepared containing a disulfide linker between a murine monoclonal antibody (5E9), which recognized the human transferrin receptor, and the ribosome-inactivating protein gelonin. This immunoconjugate was found to consist of two major species, 5E9-gelonin2 and 5E9-gelonin1, and a minor species of 5E9-gelonin3 and less than 10% of either free antibody or gelonin. 5E9-gelonin was extremely toxic in vitro to human tumor cell lines expressing the 5E9 antigen, including a Burkitt's lymphoma, an adult T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia, an acute myelogenous leukemia, a promyelocytic leukemia, and a cervical carcinoma line. A 24-hour exposure to 10(-9) M immunoconjugate killed 90-99.9% of tumor cells, depending on the cell line. A 5E9-negative murine leukemia was not sensitive to this conjugate. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the disappearance of this immunoconjugate from the murine circulation revealed that it had a biphasic clearance, with an initial rapid phase with a half-life (t1/2) of 3 hours and a later, slower phase with a t1/2 of about 1 day. Analysis of blood samples by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that a substantial degree of disulfide-linker breakdown occurred in vivo and that the 5E9-gelonin2 species was cleared more rapidly than the 5E9-gelonin1. With use of the same clonogenic assays used to measure in vitro toxicity, biologically active immunoconjugate could be detected in murine plasma for up to 24 hours after iv administration, but the concentration of immunoconjugate by this measure was considerably less than that predicted by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The ability to deliver immunoconjugate to tumor cells in vivo was studied with use of the Burkitt's lymphoma Namalwa as a xenograft in nude mice. It was possible to deliver substantial amounts of immunoconjugate to Namalwa cells in xenografted ascites with direct ip inoculation; lower but significant amounts of immunoconjugate could be delivered to this xenograft after systemic iv administration, provided the tumor burden was low. The 5E9-gelonin conjugate, when administered iv at the time of ip tumor inoculation, prolonged survival of nude mice bearing Namalwa or other human tumors as ascites xenografts and delayed or prevented the growth of subcutaneous nodules of Namalwa in an antigen-specific fashion after a single iv injection. Direct intratumoral administration also inhibited the growth of visible subcutaneous nodules of Namalwa. This immunoconjugate may be useful in the treatment of human cancer.\r"

To maintain the immunotherapeutic effects of IL-2 plus LAK treatment but reduce its toxicity, ways were sought to augment IL-2 effects. The investigation showed that the adoptive transfer of LAK cells was a prerequisite for successful therapy of intraperitoneal cancer. When LAK cells were given on consecutive days within one course of immunotherapy, antitumor efficacy was augmented with additional doses of LAK cells. However, with the reduction of 1 complete cycle of IL-2 + LAK cells, no further reduction in intraperitoneal tumor was observed as compared to the reduction after 2 or 4 cycles. LAK cells generated from splenocytes of mice that had received an allogeneic tumor challenge 1 week earlier exerted a highly increased cytotoxicity as compared to normal LAK cells. Furthermore, the potentiation effect of an allogeneic response of the host at the tumor site was demonstrated by decreased numbers of lung implants and improved survival in mice given mixtures of syngeneic and allogeneic tumor cell suspensions. An alloimmune response within the microenvironment of tumor tissue markedly enhanced the antitumor effect of IL-2 against the syngeneic tumor. It was concluded that there is a fundamental need to improve the recruitment of adoptively transferred LAK cells or LAK precursors into tumor tissue. This may be the next step required in the further development of IL-2 and LAK immunotherapy.\r"

However, the volume of drinks consumed did not change significantly.

Mixed findings were obtained with regard to drinking problems. Little difference was found over time in the proportion of respondents experiencing any of nine possible problem consequences, but there was an increase in the proportion who reported experiencing one of four possible dependence problems.

Pretreatment of spleen cells with anti-Thy 1.2 serum + C' and nylon-wool columns were utilized to separate cell populations and to characterize the cellular source of the enhancing activity in the spleens of STBM and LTBM. In this tumor system, evidence is presented for distinct enhancing cell population operating in the spleens of STBM and LTBM.

Secondary amyloidosis subsequently developed in one of these patients. In contrast, in febrile patients' serum and urine IL-1 activity was low, apparently reflecting the presence of a strong inhibitor of IL-1 activity measured by the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production by synovial cells. This inhibition was greatest at the time of peak temperature, suggesting the possibility of feedback regulation during fever. This novel identification in S-JCA of a specific IL-1 inhibitor that competes at the IL-1 receptor level may be an important step in the understanding of the pattern of fever and the evaluation of disease in patients with S-JCA.\r"

  ".W": "In a cohort of 5833 subjects in whom the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was diagnosed in New York City before 1986, the cumulative probability of survival (mean +/- SE) was 48.8 +/- 0.7 percent at one year and 15.2 +/- 1.8 percent at five years. The group with the most favorable survival rate--white homosexual men 30 to 34 years old who presented with Kaposi's sarcoma only--had a one-year cumulative probability of survival of 80.5 percent; that group was used as the reference group in assessing the effect of five variables: sex, race or ethnic background, age, probable route of acquiring AIDS (risk group), and manifestations of AIDS at diagnosis. The range in the mortality rate was greater than threefold, depending on these variables. Black women who acquired the disease through intravenous drug abuse, for example, had a particularly poor prognosis. The manifestations of disease at diagnosis had the most influence on survival, accounting on average for 56.3 percent of the excess risk. This variable was followed in importance by age (12.2 percent), race or ethnicity (10.6 percent), risk group (8.4 percent), and sex (8.0 percent), with 4.5 percent of the risk attributable to interactions between variables. When we compared subcohorts based on the year of diagnosis (1981 through 1985), we found a significant improvement in the one-year cumulative probability of survival among subjects with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, but not among subjects without P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "We used in situ hybridization to study the expression of herpes simplex virus type 1 genes during latent infections of human sensory ganglia. Trigeminal ganglia were recovered at autopsy from 24 subjects with no evidence of an active herpetic infection. These ganglia were hybridized to 35S-labeled single-stranded RNA probes spanning 72 percent of the herpes simplex genome. In the ganglia of 16 subjects, 0.2 to 4.3 percent of the neuronal cells contained abundant nuclear signals for viral RNA. Ganglia from three patients with low or undetectable levels of antibodies to herpes simplex type 1 lacked viral RNA signals, whereas the ganglia from all of six patients with elevated antibody titers showed viral RNA signals. Transcription was detected only from the region of the viral genome containing a gene that encodes an immediate early protein known as the infected-cell protein number zero (ICP0). However, normal (\"sense\") transcripts of this gene, which are prominent in an acute infection, were not detected. In contrast, a novel transcript was found overlapping with, but opposite in direction to, the ICP0 transcript (and was therefore \"anti-sense\"). Although this transcript has been only partially characterized, we believe that it may have a role in maintaining the latency of herpes simplex virus.\r"

  ".W": "The myelodysplastic syndromes are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and refractory cytopenias. In an attempt to improve hematopoiesis, we administered recombinant human granulocyte--macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to eight patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, as part of a Phase I trial. The GM-CSF was given by continuous intravenous infusion daily for two weeks and then again after a two-week rest period. Over the entire dose range tested (30 to 500 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area), treatment was associated with marked increases in peripheral-blood leukocytes (5- to 70-fold), including granulocytes (5- to 373-fold), in all eight patients. The absolute number of monocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes increased in all patients. Three of eight patients also had 2- to 10-fold increases in platelet counts and improvement in erythropoiesis, with the result that two of three patients who had required red-cell and platelet transfusions no longer needed them (at 20 to 27 weeks of follow-up). Treatment was also associated with increased marrow cellularity and a decreased percentage of blasts in the bone marrow of patients with excess blasts, resulting in an increase in the ratio of differentiated myeloid cells to immature myeloid cells. We observed relatively few side effects, but bone pain was dose-limiting when it was associated with high white-cell counts. Our results showed that GM-CSF is a potent stimulator of hematopoiesis in vivo and may produce hematologic improvement in the short term (8 to 32 weeks of observation) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. More experience, with longer follow-up periods, will be necessary to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of this new treatment.\r"

In CML the abl gene is translocated from chromosome 9 to the centre of the bcr gene on chromosome 22 and this results in production of chimaeric bcr-abl RNA translated into a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 210,000 (210K). Our data indicate that in ALL abl is translocated into the 5' region of the bcr gene. The consequence of this is the expression of a fused transcript in which the first exon of bcr is linked to the second abl exon. This transcript encodes a 190K protein kinase.\r"

We have developed an assay that allows direct characterization of cellular proteins binding to the enhancer element of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is analogous to immunoprecipitation techniques. In extracts of H9 cells, a human CD4+ lymphoblast line clonally selected for its ability to support HIV replication, we find a class of proteins that interact specifically with the HIV enhancer. Reproducible high-resolution, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has allowed us to resolve these proteins into two major sets. One set is common to H9 cells, two human B-lymphoblast lines, and a phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human CD4+ lymphoblast line (Jurkat). A second set of proteins is found only in H9 cells. Thus, with this assay we have identified HIV enhancer-binding proteins that are constitutive or inducible and that are cell-type specific.\r"

A 10,000-fold elevation of mouse uterine CSF-1 during pregnancy, suggested by studies of the bone marrow colony stimulating activity of uterine extracts, was recently demonstrated by radioimmunoassay (RIA). This increase and the observations that placenta and choriocarcinoma cell lines express c-fms messenger RNA and the c-fms proto oncogene product (CSF-1 receptor) respectively, suggest an additional role for CSF-1 in pregnancy. We now show that uterine CSF-1 concentration is regulated by the synergistic action of female sex steroids, oestradiol-17 beta (E2) and progesterone (P) and that the elevation in CSF-1 concentration can be attributed to the preferential expression of an alternatively spliced CSF-1 mRNA by uterine glandular epithelial cells. These findings indicate that CSF-1, under hormonal influence, plays a role in placental development and function and that steroid hormones may regulate developmental processes via their effects on the expression of tissue-specific growth factors.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gene expression is controlled by cellular transcription factors and by virally encoded trans-activation proteins of the HIV-1 tat and art/trs genes, which are essential for viral replication. Tat trans-activates HIV-1 gene expression by interacting with the trans-acting response element (TAR) located within the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) (ref. 2). In transient expression assays, tat mediates its effects largely by increasing the steady-state levels of messenger RNA species that contain the TAR sequence at or near their 5' ends, suggesting a function for tat either in transcription or in subsequent RNA processing. The tat gene could also facilitate translation of mRNA containing the TAR sequence. To determine the mechanism of trans-activation by tat, we analysed the structure and rate of synthesis of RNA species directed by the HIV-1 LTR in transient expression assays both in the presence and absence of tat. Although the rate of HIV-1 transcription initiation was not affected by tat, transcriptional elongation beyond position +59 was seen only in the presence of tat. Thus, tat trans-activates HIV-1 transcription by relieving a specific block to transcriptional elongation within the TAR sequence.\r"

We have now tested this prediction using a tailored series of plasmids carrying the inserts AAGGGAGAAXGGGGTATAGGGGYAAGAGGGAA, where X and Y may be either A or G, and subject them to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In support of our hypothesis, the inserts exhibited facile transitions into the H form for X = Y = G, or X = Y = A, whereas the transition was much more difficult or impossible for the two non-palindromes (X = A, Y = G or X = G, Y = A). We present evidence that the H form is the structural basis for S1-nuclease hypersensitivity.\r"

On most murine and human T cells the T cell receptor (TCR) is composed of disulphide-linked alpha and beta chains (TCR alpha/beta), each of which contains constant and variable domains, and which are associated with the invariant chains of the CD3 complex. It has been demonstrated, however, that a distinct CD3-associated TCR is expressed on a small subset of T cells or immature thymocytes which fail to express either CD4 or CD8 (refs 7-14), the molecules associated with class II or class I MHC antigen recognition. Instead of TCR alpha/beta, these cells express heterodimers of gamma and delta chains (TRC gamma/delta). The genes encoding alpha, beta, and gamma have been isolated and characterized. A new murine T cell receptor (Cx) gene which undergoes rearrangement and expression early during T cell ontogeny has recently been identified 5' of the murine J alpha C alpha gene locus. Here we isolate and sequence the homologous transcript from PEER, a human cell line that expresses a TCR gamma/delta, and show that it encodes a protein with characteristic V, D, J, and C segments. Using probes derived from this transcript, we have shown that both PEER and MOLT-13, another TCR gamma/delta-expressing cell line, rearrange this locus and express two sizes of transcripts differing in the 3' untranslated region. Using a synthetic peptide derived from the deduced C region sequence, we have prepared antisera that precipitates the delta chain of the TCR from both PEER and MOLT-13, thus demonstrating that Cx and its human homologue code for the delta chain of the TCR.\r"

One of the two disulphide-linked chains of this putative second receptor, which in mice has relative molecular mass (Mr) 35,000 (35K), has been identified as a product of the group of gamma genes. The other chain, termed delta (Mr 45K in mice), is not as well characterized. Although gamma/delta-bearing cells are a minor subset among peripheral T lymphocytes, they are the only CD3+ cells in the thymus early in ontogeny. Taking advantage of these kinetics, we have generated gamma/delta-bearing hybridomas, using a new TCR alpha chain-negative variant of the AKR thymoma BW5147 as tumour parent, fetal thymocytes as normal cell partners, and an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) as screening reagent. Gamma and delta chains from one of these hybrids have been purified and partially sequenced.

A small subpopulation of thymic and peripheral T cells, as well as Thy-1+dendritic epidermal cells (dEC), express an alternative CD3-associated dimeric receptor composed of the product of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) gamma gene and a fourth chain, designated delta. Recently a new murine TCR constant-region gene, designated Cx, has been cloned and proposed as a candidate for the C delta gene. We have previously demonstrated that murine Thy-1+ dEC cell lines express a CD3-associated disulphide-linked heterodimer composed of a relative molecular mass Mr 41,000 (41K) gamma chain and a 50K delta chain. We have further analysed the receptor of one of these cloned dEC lines, 7-17.1, by endoglycosidase treatment of the isolated gamma and delta chains. The gamma chain was found to contain two N-linked oligosaccharide residues, consistent with the expression of a chain encoded by the V gamma 3 and C gamma 1 gene segments. The delta chain contains at least three N-linked oligosaccharides and has a core size of 38K. Northern blot analysis indicated the presence of abundant Cx messenger RNA in 7-17.1 cells. Immunoprecipitation with two antisera to peptides comprising distinct regions of the Cx sequence indicates that the delta chain is encoded by the Cx gene.\r"

It has been suggested that Ins P3 itself can act to stimulate Ca2+ uptake from the extracellular fluid, although a physiological function for Ins P4 was not excluded. Transmembrane currents can now be measured in single cells by voltage clamping under conditions where the intracellular perfusion fluid can be changed several times during individual experiments. We have used this method to test the effects of Ins P3 and Ins P4 on the Ca2+-activated K+ current, and now show that neither Ins P3 alone nor Ins P4 alone can activate a sustained current, whereas Ins P3 and Ins P4 in combination evoke a sustained increase in Ca2+-activated K+ current which is dependent on external Ca2+.\r"

  ".W": "The class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (H-2 in mouse, HLA in man) are membrane proteins composed of a polymorphic heavy chain associated with beta-2-microglobulin. Recent studies suggest that class I molecules present peptides derived from processed antigens to the receptor of cytolytic T cells. In particular, in the H-2d haplotype, synthetic HLA peptides can be recognized on Kd-bearing target cells by Kd-restricted cytolytic T cells specific for HLA. Here we analyse the specificity of presentation of two HLA peptides by a set of chimaeric Kd/Dd molecules to four different cytolytic T-cell clones. We identify two distinct regions within the second external (alpha 2) domain of Kd that contribute to its specificity as a restriction element. Our results indicate that the binding of an immunogenic peptide by a class I molecule is not always sufficient for its recognition by the T-cell antigen receptor. This suggests that the major histocompatibility complex restriction element either interacts with the T-cell antigen receptor or induces the recognized conformation of the peptide.\r"

Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, other calcitropic hormones, osteocalcin, and minerals were examined in lactating and nonlactating women consuming a vegetarian or nonvegetarian diet. The vegetarian diet was a macrobiotic diet consisting primarily of whole cereal grains and vegetables; dairy products, eggs, and meats were generally avoided. We tested the thesis that the effect of lactation on serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is more pronounced in women on vegetarian diets than in those on nonvegetarian diets. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significantly higher in lactating women compared with nonlactating women and in vegetarian compared with nonvegetarian women. Among vegetarian women, mean serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were 37% higher in the lactating group. For all subjects, serum parathyroid hormone was elevated during lactation compared with nonlactation. Thus, a vegetarian diet appears to be associated with increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D during lactation.\r"

A recent choroidal hemorrhage associated with a thrombosed vortex vein was observed in one eye. The favorable outcome was likely due both to preplaced sutures that allowed immediate tamponade of the hemorrhage and to the additional possible tamponading effect of an intact posterior capsule in the left eye. The possible role of venous stasis leading to vortex vein thrombosis as a cause of recent choroidal hemorrhage is discussed.\r"

Her scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave attained normal amplitudes after 45 minutes of dark adaptation. The half-time for regeneration of rhodopsin after an extensive bleach was 16 minutes, four times longer than normal, and the maximum density difference measured by fundus reflectometry was at the lower limit of the normal range. Although photopigment kinetics were significantly faster than observed in other reported cases of fundus albipunctatus, it appears likely that there is a wide spectrum of functional and funduscopic abnormalities in this disorder.

The author studied seven patients, four of whom were seen soon after the visual loss and followed prospectively. A detailed review of the extensive literature and analysis of the cases provide relevant information on the subject. The blood loss is usually from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, less often from other sites. There is typically a time lag between the bleeding and the onset of visual loss--usually up to 10 days, less often even 2 to 3 weeks. The ocular findings are typically those of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) and are usually bilateral. Considerable evidence has accumulated that blood loss, with or without arterial hypotension, causes increase in release of renin and endogenous vasoconstrictor agents (e.g., angiotensin, epinephrine, and vasopressin) because of activation of the sympathoadrenergic system and vasomotor center. Our experimental studies on renovascular malignant hypertension indicate that endogenous vasoconstrictor agents produce choroidal ischemia and AION. In view of all the evidence, it is postulated that in the production of AION after blood loss, release of endogenous vasoconstrictor agents is probably a very important factor, with arterial hypotension an additional factor; increased platelet aggregation may also play a role.\r"

Our experience indicates that the patient, rather than the type of endoscopic treatment, often dictates outcome. Patients with abnormal bleeding times, chronic renal failure, or severe heart disease often have poorer palliation results, higher complication rates, and faster recurrence rates. Even patients without these poor prognostic factors tend to have recurrences of angiomas and bleeding.\r"

We find that monomers are low-affinity receptors and dimers are high-affinity receptors. In the absence of EGF, dimers exhibit a 4-fold higher autophosphorylation activity than do monomers. Addition of EGF increases autophosphorylation on monomers an average of 4.8-fold but has a minimal effect on autophosphorylation of dimers. Furthermore, EGF binding shifts the receptor monomer-dimer equilibrium to the dimer form. We conclude that EGF stimulates in vitro receptor autophosphorylation by inducing kinase-inactive receptor monomers to associate and form receptor dimers, in which conformation the autophosphorylation activity is enhanced.\r"

In a review of amino acid sequences deduced from cDNA data, we have observed that a conserved sequence containing a potential asparagine hydroxylation site exists within EGF-like domains of a variety of functionally diverse proteins. We have studied a number of these and report the presence of erythro-beta-hydroxyasparagine (e-beta Hyn) in three non-vitamin K-dependent proteins: the plasma complement proteins C1r and C1s (where overbar indicates activated form) and the urinary protein uromodulin. For each protein, e-beta Hyn was identified in enzyme digests following the initial observation of erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid (e-beta Hya) in acid hydrolysates of the proteins. e beta Hya and e-beta Hyn residues are detected by a postcolumn derivatization cation-exchange HPLC method herein described. HPLC isolation of the presumptive e-beta Hyn residue from enzyme digests of intact C1r allowed confirmation of its structure by GC/MS. Based upon available cDNA sequence data and observation of e-beta Hya in acid hydrolysates, we suggest other proteins in which e-beta Hyn may occur.\r"

  ".U": "88068519\r", 
  ".W": "The development of the vertebrate neural crest presents a particularly challenging problem in pattern formation. Several studies have revealed that a population of neural crest cells penetrates the sclerotomal mesenchyme of the somite only in its rostral half. In a search for molecular correlates of this pattern, we have observed that cytotactin and a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, two interactive extracellular matrix molecules, show a specialized distribution within the sclerotome. Cytotactin was localized in the rostral half of the sclerotome at about the time of neural crest cell invasion. The proteoglycan was initially diffuse throughout the sclerotome but became restricted to the caudal half after the appearance of cytotactin and invasion of neural crest cells in the rostral half. These distributions were crest cell-independent; they occurred on the same schedule even when all crest cells were removed by surgical extirpation of the neural tube. Furthermore, in tissue culture, somite cells synthesized high levels of both molecules. In vitro, crest cells rounded up in the presence of these molecules and cell migration assays revealed that neither cytotactin nor proteoglycan alone was as good a substratum for crest cell migration as fibronectin. In combination with fibronectin, however, cytotactin or proteoglycan only restricted cell movement but did not prevent it. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that cytotactin and the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan may contribute to pattern formation during embryogenesis by means of their site-restricted distribution, their ability to alter migration on other substrates such as fibronectin, and their ability to induce cell-surface modulation.\r"

The nonimmortalizing EBV variant, strain P3HR-1, which possesses a deletion within the BamHI WYH region of the genome containing the coding sequence for the EBV-determined nuclear antigen 2, does not induce expression of these markers. Other lymphoblastoid cell-associated antigen markers can be activated by infection with either immortalizing or nonimmortalizing viruses. These results suggest that the immortalizing potential of EBV is correlated with its ability to induce expression of B-cell activation markers, which are suspected to play a major role in the physiological pathway leading to lymphoid cell proliferation. The viral genomic region deleted in the nonimmortalizing strain of EBV seems to be required for activation of some of these markers. Human lymphoma cell lines, such as those used in this study, can thus help identify the specific EBV genes involved in lymphoid B-cell proliferation and the mechanism of action of these genes.\r"

The protein has a pI of 7.5-8.0 and is phosphorylated in B-cell lines, tonsillar B cells, and peripheral blood B cells. Both CD20 surface expression and phosphorylation are increased on buoyant tonsillar B cells activated in vivo. Because phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) supports the activation signal initiated by monoclonal antibody 1F5, we studied the effect of PMA on CD20 expression. After brief incubation with mitogenic levels of PMA, the number of dense tonsillar B cells positive for CD20 protein transiently decreased. Paradoxically, the cells remaining positive had more surface CD20 than did control cells, and these remaining surface CD20 molecules were hyperphosphorylated. Furthermore, PMA not only induced phosphorylation of CD20 protein on Raji cells but also increased the internalization of CD20 molecules; both phosphorylation and internalization of CD20 molecules were decreased with the protein kinase C inhibitor palmitoyl carnitine. Conditions that increase CD20 phosphorylation are shown also to increase surface mobility of the molecule, suggesting that CD20 protein internalization may be a critical early event for B-cell entry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\r"

A 3.7-kilobase (kb) Taq I and a 1.7-kb Pvu II restriction endonuclease fragment that correspond to a 21-OHase B gene were absent from the DNA of two unrelated patients with the salt-wasting form of the disease. However, a 10.5-kb Bgl II fragment corresponding to the region encompassing the 21-OHase B gene was still present in these two patients. The genes encoding 21-OHase were cloned from one of these two patients, who was homozygous by descent for HLA-A26;B39;C4A3;C4B1;DR4. Restriction endonuclease mapping as well as partial nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed that the 21-OHase B gene of the patient has been converted to the pseudogene, 21-OHase A, as far as the critical 0.5-kb sequence was concerned. Thus, the defect was due to both chromosomes each carrying two copies of 21-OHase A pseudogene and lacking functional 21-OHase B gene.\r"

  ".U": "88068555\r", 
  ".W": "Cultures of bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells accumulated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by a process that was prevented by desmethylimipramine. The subcellular localization of the incorporated [methyl-3H]MPP+ was examined by differential centrifugation and sucrose density gradient fractionation and was found to be predominantly colocalized with catecholamines in chromaffin vesicles, and negligible amounts were detected within the mitochondrial fraction. When chromaffin cell membranes were made permeable with the detergent digitonin in the absence of calcium, there was no increase in the release of [3H]MPP+, indicating that there is negligible accumulation of the neurotoxin in the cytosol. Simultaneous exposure to digitonin and calcium induced cosecretion of MPP+ and catecholamines. Stimulation of the cells with nicotine released both catecholamines and MPP+ at identical rates and percentages of cellular content in a calcium-dependent manner. Last, when cells were incubated with MPP+ in the presence of tetrabenazine (an inhibitor of vesicular uptake), the chromaffin cell toxicity of MPP+ was potentiated. We submit that the ability of the chromaffin cells to take up and store MPP+ in the chromaffin vesicle prevents the toxin's interaction with other structures and, thus, prevents cell damage. As an extension of this hypothesis, the relative resistance of some brain monoaminergic neurons to the toxic actions of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine may result from the subcellular sequestration of MPP+ in the storage vesicle.\r"

Because antibody reactivity was associated with endothelia that have a selective permeability barrier, the antibody was called anti-endothelial-barrier antigen (anti-EBA). Paraffin sections of Bouins'-fixed rat tissue were used for initial screening and subsequent characterization of antibody reactivity. The antibody was generally unreactive with endothelial cells in other organs and with nonendothelial cells in or outside of the nervous system. Antibody binding was greatly reduced or absent in endothelia of the area postrema and choroid plexus, sites known to possess fenestrated blood vessels. In developing rat brain, anti-EBA binding to some microvessels was seen at 3 days postnatally. Anti-EBA reactivity outside the nervous system occurred in spleen and skin. Patchy reaction with portions of some spleen blood vessels and binding to some cells in the spleen were observed. In the skin, small cells, tentatively identified as Langerhans cells, which participate in Ia presentation, were stained. On immunoblots of rat brain microvessel preparations electrophoresed in Na-DodSO4/polyacrylamide gels, anti-EBA reacted with a protein triplet of Mr 30,000, 25,000, and 23,500 components.\r"

  ".W": "The properties of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor sites in the anterior pituitary were evaluated by binding studies with InsP3 labeled with 32P to high specific radioactivity. Specific binding of Ins[32P]P3 was demonstrable in pituitary membrane preparations and was linearly proportional to the amount of membrane added over the range 0.5-2 mg of protein. Kinetic studies showed that specific InsP3 binding was half-maximal in about 40 sec and reached a plateau after 15 min at 0 degree C. Addition of 1 microM unlabeled InsP3 was followed by rapid dissociation of the bound ligand, according to a single exponential function with half-time of about 1 min. Scatchard analysis of the binding data was consistent with a single set of high-affinity sites with Kd of 1.1 +/- 0.4 nM and maximal binding capacity of 28 +/- 15 fmol/mg of protein (n = 6). The specificity of Ins[32P]P3 binding to these sites was illustrated by the much weaker affinity for structural analogs such as inositol 1-phosphate, phytic acid, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. To assess the functional relevance of the InsP3 binding sites, the Ca2+-releasing activity of InsP3 was measured in pituitary membrane preparations. In the presence of oligomycin (2.5 micrograms/ml), Ca2+ movements were monitored with the fluorescent indicator fura-2 (free acid). Under these conditions, 1 mM ATP caused rapid uptake of Ca2+ by a vesicular component of the membrane fraction. Addition of InsP3 (50-2000 nM) caused a dose-dependent release of Ca2+ with a half-maximal effect at 240 nM. In the presence of 3% polyethylene glycol, GTP also stimulated calcium release. However, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, did not release calcium and completely blocked the effect of GTP. Under physiological conditions within the cytosol, the high-affinity InsP3 binding sites characterized in pituitary membranes could serve as the putative receptors through which InsP3 triggers Ca2+ mobilization in the anterior pituitary gland.\r"

We now provide evidence that alternative pathways of activation may also be recruited during such activation. We utilized depletion of protein kinase C activity to determine whether this enzyme is required under all conditions for anti-immunoglobulin-stimulated B-cell activation. Although anti-immunoglobulin does not induce B-cell proliferation in protein kinase C-depleted cells, it stimulates an earlier event in B-cell activation as reflected by its ability to enhance the expression of major histocompatibility complex-encoded class II molecules. Furthermore, the ribonucleoside 8-mercaptoguanosine restores the ability of anti-immunoglobulin to induce B-cell proliferation in protein kinase C-depleted cells. This restoration is also demonstrated by an enhancement of synthesis of a nuclear protein that we find is increased during B-cell mitogenesis. These results indicate that B-cell activation stimulated by anti-immunoglobulin may recruit pathways in addition to the one dependent on protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable evidence now exists to support the notion that the 50-kDa sheep erythrocyte binding protein, T11, represents an essential cell surface component of a human T-cell-lineage activation pathway. Furthermore, it is known that the human T-cell antigen-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptor complex T3-Ti is capable of regulating cell growth mediated by the T11 structure. Here we show that, within the T3+ thymocyte compartment, T3-Ti crosslinking rapidly inhibits T11-initiated interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene transcription and translation. This inhibition is restricted to the IL-2 gene (IL2) as transcription of both the IL-2 receptor gene (IL2R) and the Ti beta-chain gene (TCRB) are not affected (human gene designations are in parentheses). Perhaps more importantly, T3-Ti-mediated IL-2 inhibition of this type is not operational in peripheral T lymphocytes. The results imply that the majority of T3+ thymocytes are functionally distinct from peripheral T lymphocytes despite their T3+ phenotype and may possess a unique endogenous regulatory component for suppressing IL-2 gene activity. Moreover, since IL-2 is likely rate-limiting for growth within the thymus, the findings provide one plausible mechanism for thymic selection--namely, T3-Ti crosslinking of thymocytes upon interaction with self-major histocompatibility complex inhibits clonal expansion of high-affinity autoreactive cells.\r"

In the course of characterizing human T-cell tumors with an immature (CD4-, CD8-) surface phenotype, we detected a 2-kilobase alpha-related transcript. Analysis of cDNA clones corresponding to this transcript established that a genetic element (which we call TEA, for \"T early alpha\") located between the alpha-chain variable- and joining-region genes had been spliced to the alpha constant region. The TEA transcript is present early in thymocyte ontogeny, and its expression declines during T-cell maturation. More important, the TEA area functions as an active site for rearrangement within the alpha gene locus. Blot hybridization of restriction enzyme-digested DNA with a TEA probe revealed a narrowly limited pattern of rearrangement in polyclonal thymic DNA, surprisingly different from the pattern expected for the mature alpha gene with its complex diversity. These DNA blots also showed that TEA is generally present in the germ-line configuration in cells expressing the gamma delta heterodimeric receptor and is deleted from mature (alpha beta-expressing) T-lymphocyte tumors and lines. Moreover, the TEA transcript lacked a long open reading frame for protein but instead possessed multiple copies of a repetitive element resembling those utilized in the heavy-chain class switch of the immunoglobulin genes. The temporal nature of the rearrangements and expression detected by TEA suggests that this recombination could mediate a transition between immature (gamma delta-expressing) T cells and mature (alpha beta-expressing) T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Two cDNA clones encoding prepro-sphingolipid activator protein 1 (SAP-1) were isolated from a lambda gt11 human hepatoma expression library using polyclonal antibodies. These had inserts of approximately 2 kilobases (lambda-S-1.2 and lambda-S-1.3) and both were both homologous with a previously isolated clone (lambda-S-1.1) for mature SAP-1. We report here the nucleotide sequence of the longer two EcoRI fragments of S-1.2 and S-1.3 that were not the same and the derived amino acid sequences of mature SAP-1 and its prepro form. The open reading frame encodes 19 amino acids, which are colinear with the amino-terminal sequence of mature SAP-1, and extends far beyond the predicted carboxyl terminus of mature SAP-1, indicating extensive carboxyl-terminal processing. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding prepro-SAP-1 includes 1449 bases from the assigned initiation codon ATG at base-pair 472 to the stop codon TGA at base-pair 1921. The first 23 amino acids coded after the initiation ATG are characteristic of a signal peptide. The calculated molecular mass for a polypeptide encoded by 1449 bases is approximately 53 kDa, in keeping with the reported value for pro-SAP-1. The data indicate that after removal of the signal peptide (23 amino acids) mature SAP-1 (78 amino acids) is generated by removing an additional 7 amino acids from the amino terminus and approximately 373 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus. One potential glycosylation site was previously found in mature SAP-1. Three additional potential glycosylation sites are present in the processed carboxyl-terminal polypeptide, which we designate as P-2. The molecular mass of glycosylated pro-SAP-1 is estimated at approximately 69 kDa, assuming glycosylation of all four sites. The value is close to the reported 70-kDa value for glycosylated pro-SAP-1. A computer search failed to reveal homology between P-2 and the sequence of any other protein; its function is uncertain. The 3' untranslated region is composed of 90 base pairs and is incomplete, since it does not contain a polyadenylylation site or a poly(A) tail.\r"

TNF is a mediator of activated macrophages that is released into the supernatant by these cells after their stimulation with endotoxin. A number of biologic functions of TNF other than its tumoricidal activity have been demonstrated. In vivo, TNF induces reactions similar to those induced by endotoxin. Hypothermia, elevated hematocrit and plasma lactate levels, and reduced plasma glucose levels have been measured in mice injected with TNF. These reactions typically occur soon after endotoxin injection and are induced with purified recombinant TNF in mice that exhibit a low response to endotoxin. No TNF-induced production of interleukin 1 (which can induce similar effects) was detected in macrophage/monocyte cultures. Therefore, TNF appears to mediate endotoxin effects directly.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism by which immune activation augments replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected T cells, four different classes of T cell mitogens were evaluated for their effects on the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a mitogenic lectin; phorbol 12-myristic 13-acetate, a tumor promoter; ionomycin, a calcium ionophore; and tat-1, the trans-activator protein from the human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) each stimulated the HIV-1 LTR. Studies of deleted forms of the LTR supported a central role in these responses for the HIV-1 enhancer, which alone was sufficient for mitogen inducibility, but also suggested that other 5' positive and negative regulatory elements contribute to the overall magnitude of the response. Synergistic activation of the HIV-1 LTR (up to several thousandfold) was observed with combinations of these mitogens and the HIV-1--derived tat-III protein. Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive agent, inhibited PHA-mediated activation of the HIV-1 LTR but was without effect in the presence of other mitogens. Thus, HIV-1 gene expression and replication appear to be regulated, via the HIV-1 LTR, by the same mitogenic signals that induce T cell activation.\r"

This virus is related to but distinct from human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus types I and II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). With the use of a fragment of provirus cloned from one patient with T cell leukemia, closely related sequences were found in DNA of the cell line and of tumor cells from seven other patients with the same disease; these sequences were only distantly related to HTLV-I. The phenotype of the cells and the clinical course of the disease were clearly distinguishable from leukemia associated with HTLV-I. All patients and the wife of one patient showed a weak serological cross-reactivity with both HTLV-I and HIV-1 antigens. None of the patients proved to be at any apparent risk for HIV-1 infection. The name proposed for this virus is HTLV-V, and the date indicate that it may be a primary etiological factor in the major group of cutaneous T cell lymphomas/leukemias, including the sporadic lymphomas known as mycoses fungoides.\r"

As a step toward designing antagonists of this binding event, soluble, secreted forms of CD4 were produced by transfection of mammalian cells with vectors encoding versions of CD4 lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The soluble CD4 so produced binds gp120 with an affinity and specificity comparable to intact CD4 and is capable of neutralizing the infectivity of HIV-1. These studies reveal that the high-affinity CD4-gp120 interaction does not require other cell or viral components and may establish a novel basis for therapeutic intervention in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

However, other features of the sequence distinguish the eph gene product from known receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. Thus the eph protein may define a new class of these molecules. The eph gene is overexpressed in several human carcinomas, suggesting that this gene may be involved in the neoplastic process of some tumors.\r"

MTC cells were inoculated from tissue culture into eight Wag-Rij rats. One month later blood was drawn before and after the intravenous injection of calcium, and plasma levels of CGRP and calcitonin (CT) levels in that blood were determined by radioimmunoassay. The tumor was examined for content of CGRP and of CT by means of radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemistry. The tumor was divided and portions were passed to another eight rats. One month later, the studies were repeated. The tumor was passed two additional times (four passages in all). Controls consisted of non-tumor-bearing Wag-Rij rats. Basal levels of plasma CGRP in control rats (7 +/- 1 ng/ml) were unaffected by calcium stimulation. In tumor-bearing rats, the plasma CGRP level, which was initially slightly elevated (15 +/- 7 ng/ml), rose progressively with passages to 279 +/- 79 ng/ml in the third passage and fell to normal values at the end of passage four. Hypercalcemia had no effect on plasma CGRP levels in tumor-bearing rats but did stimulate the release of CT in both control and tumor-bearing rats, although it is not clear whether this release was from the tumor or from normal thyroid parafollicular cells in these tumor-bearing rats. We conclude that rat MTC synthesizes and releases CGRP but, unlike CT, CGRP appears unresponsive to calcium stimulation.\r"

The estimated values of antibody affinities for Sepharose-coupled C3 ranged from 2.8 X 10(6) l per M to 5.0 X 10(8) l per M; on average, IgM antibodies had higher affinities than IgG antibodies. Competitive binding assays showed that the monoclonal antibodies recognized at least seven different epitopes, four on the C3c and three on the C3d fragment of C3. When the results of serologic and quantitative assays were compared, no convincing relationship was found between serologic performance and epitope specificity, antibody concentration, or affinity. IgM antibodies generally gave higher agglutination scores than IgG antibodies, and Ig class was the only useful predictor of serologic efficacy.\r"

In previously reported cases, the hemolysis was usually extravascular and the causative antibodies were IgG, incapable of activating complement, and demonstrable by the direct or indirect antiglobulin test using red cells (RBCs) pretreated in vitro with cephalosporin. The authors report a patient in whom acute intravascular hemolysis developed while she was receiving cefotaxime (a cephalosporin as yet not reported to cause IHA). The patient's RBCs were coated only with complement fragments (C3d), even at the peak of the hemolytic episode. Her serum and eluates repeatedly yielded negative results when tested against normal or cephalosporin-coated RBCs. However, strong hemagglutination and C5b-9-mediated hemolysis were observed if the patient's serum was tested against RBCs in the presence of the drug, its ex vivo antigen and, to a lesser degree, cephalothin and ceftriaxon, but not in the presence of penicillin and other related cephalosporins. The positive reactions were not changed by preincubating the serum with different amounts of the drugs. All of these findings reflect the typical picture of drug-induced IHA by the so-called \"immune complex\" mechanism and not by the drug-adsorption mechanism. The authors conclude that cephalosporin can cause immune hemolysis in two ways: the drug-adsorption mechanism and, as described here, the \"immune complex\" mechanism.\r"

The biologic activity of plasma fibronectin, as assessed by the spreading of Chinese hamster ovary cells or attachment of monocytes to gelatin-coated surfaces, was similar to that of plasma fibronectin concentrates made from fresh or stored plasma. Only 20 to 30 percent of the factor VIII activity in fresh plasma was recovered in cryoprecipitate produced after the heparin-induced precipitate containing fibronectin was removed. Cryoprecipitate prepared from the supernatant plasma that remains after heparin-induced cold precipitation in the presence of CaCl2 (5 mM) contained approximately 50 percent less factor VIII. The relatively low recovery of factor VIII in cryoprecipitate prepared from fibronectin-depleted plasma makes cryoprecipitation an unsuitable method of producing fibronectin-rich and factor VIII-rich components effectively from a single unit of fresh plasma. However, heparin-induced cold precipitation provides an efficient method for preparing plasma fibronectin concentrates from small plasma pools or single units of stored or fresh plasma.\r"

This applies to both the introduction of the new methods and the retirement of older methods that may have outlived their usefulness. Within that framework, the rapid diffusion of innovative methods of great value must be balanced against the cost of premature enthusiasm for techniques with little or no incremental diagnostic or therapeutic gain. A nongovernmental Council on Health Care Technology Assessment of the Institute of Medicine-National Academy of Sciences was established by the Congress in 1986. The Council was charged to serve as an information clearing-house, a center to promote research and education, and a stimulus to establish better methods of assessment and more prompt identification of potentially important technologies. It represents virtually all of the constituencies concerned with adequate evaluation of new and existing methods. The Council confronts the critical problems of timing, bias, the quality of primary data collection, new methods of secondary data analysis, the nature of the \"laboratory\" in which technology assessment is best accomplished, the \"exploitative\" character of technology assessment research, appropriate diffusion, and ethnical issues. The appropriate use of technology in modern health care depends on the resolution of these issues.\r"

Of the 101 segmental bronchi showing bronchiectasis on bronchography, CT correctly identified bronchiectasis in 98 segments (97%).

Of the 52 segmental bronchi showing cylindrical bronchiectasis on bronchography, CT correctly identified these changes in 49 segments but failed to detect it in three. The presence of interstitial lung disease with emphysema and very localized mild bronchiectasis in one case each made the identification of cylindrical bronchiectasis difficult and caused the false-negative results. When bronchography is used as the criterion, CT with medium-thickness cuts and medium slice intervals appears to be 100% specific for all types of bronchiectasis, 100% sensitive for cystic and varicose bronchiectasis, and 94% sensitive for cylindrical bronchiectasis.\r"

This correlated well with tumor cells lining the alveolar walls, observed in pathologic studies. Comparison of thin-section CT images with pathologic data suggests that the demonstration of the lung-tumor interface and the tumor's internal texture, while not specific for malignant lesions, can make the CT diagnosis of small peripheral lung cancers more accurate.\r"

Respiratory-motion compensation, which involved a recording of the phase-encoding gradients (Exorcist), was used for the last two sequences. Spin-echo with TR = 2500 msec and TE = 70 msec was superior in lesion detection and contrast-to-noise ratio. The proton-density-weighted and T2-weighted sequences with respiratory compensation produced better artifact suppression than did the short TR, short TE T1-weighted sequence with temporal averaging. In contradistinction to prior results at 0.6 T, T2-weighted pulse sequences appear superior to T1-weighted pulse sequences with multiple excitations for both lesion detection and artifact suppression at 1.5 T.\r"

Areas of thrombosis (nine cases), calcification (four cases), and hemorrhage (four cases) were also present. We also reviewed 15 hemangiomas of the liver in 12 patients studied by MR imaging. Gross photographs and MR scans were available in three hemangiomas, thus allowing direct radiologic-pathologic correlation. Twelve (80%) of the hemangiomas were inhomogeneous on T2-weighted images and three (20%) were homogeneous. Other characteristics were sharp margins in all 15 cases (100%), lobulations in 11 cases (73%), peripheral location in 10 cases (67%), and internal septations in four cases (27%). We concluded that (1) hemangiomas of the liver are frequently inhomogeneous on cut sections; (2) heterogeneity in T2 images is commonly seen and should not exclude hemangioma; and (3) other signs, such as sharp margins, lobulated contour, and peripheral location, may be helpful in the MR diagnosis of hemangioma of the liver.\r"

CT suggested the diagnosis of typhlitis (n = 7), intramural hemorrhage (n = 1), ileal perforation (n = 1), and appendiceal abscess (n = 1). The diagnosis of typhlitis was established by clinical evaluation in five patients, by colonoscopy in one patient, and by autopsy in another patient. The single cases of intestinal hemorrhage, ileal perforation, and appendiceal abscess were confirmed by exploratory laparotomy. It is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of acute abdominal conditions in the immunosuppressed patient. Symptoms and physical findings are often suppressed as a result of steroid or immunosuppressive therapy. CT, being noninvasive, is useful in the evaluation of persistent right lower quadrant pain in the immunocompromised patient.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the predictive values of using different sizes on CT as criteria for the detection of retroperitoneal lymph-node metastases in patients with early-stage (nodes 5 cm or less in diameter) primary nonseminomatous testicular cancer, we performed a retrospective analysis of 51 patients. Measurements of lymph-node transaxial diameters on CT were correlated with histologic findings at lymph-node dissection or with response to initial chemotherapy. All patients had normal serum markers (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin) after orchiectomy. The frequency of lymph-node metastases in this population was 51%. When a CT criterion of 5 mm was used, the negative predictive value was 79%; the positive predictive value, 62%; the specificity, 44%; and the sensitivity, 88%. With a criterion of 15 mm, the negative predictive value was 63%; the positive predictive value, 71%; the specificity, 76%; and the sensitivity, 58%. Metastases in retroperitoneal lymph nodes that appeared within normal limits (i.e., had normal transaxial diameters) on CT were the limiting factor in the ability of CT to exclude the presence of metastases. We conclude that using smaller sizes on CT scans as the criteria for detection of lymph-node metastases cannot replace dissection of nodes in patients who have normal-sized nodes but may be helpful in identifying a subgroup of patients who are at lower risk of harboring metastases when treatment by orchiectomy alone is considered.\r"

The ratio of the extent (E) of the involved marrow segment to the length (L) of involved bone (E/L) was correlated with the presence and subsequent development of pulmonary metastases. The marrow was evaluated by CT for the presence of tumor by measuring mean attenuation coefficients on serial axial scans. Three patient groups were identified: group 1 consisted of seven patients with lung metastases at presentation (mean E/L = 61%), group 2 consisted of 10 patients who developed lung metastases or recurrent tumor either during or after chemotherapy (mean E/L = 39%), and group 3 consisted of 20 patients who completed therapy and remained disease-free (mean E/L = 28%). All patients received chemotherapy in addition to surgical resection except for two patients in group 1. No patient with an E/L ratio greater than 50% remained disease-free for more than 14 months after the initial diagnosis. Fifty percent or greater involvement of the marrow cavity thus carries a particularly poor prognosis, and its absence or presence can be used as a significant prognostic aid in osteosarcoma.\r"

A prospective comparison was made of pediatric clinic outpatients who had chest radiography during a 1-month period. Chest widths and thicknesses were measured from the anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, respectively, and a dimensionless ratio of width to thickness was calculated. The chest thus measured was significantly flatter (p less than 10(-6] in 18 patients with chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia than it was in 128 unaffected patients and in 18 unaffected age-matched patients; there was, however, considerable overlap in chest dimensions between patients with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We speculate that the abnormality results from a combination of demineralized bones, prolonged recumbent positioning, and chronic sternal retraction. It is plausible, but remains to be proved, that this chest wall deformity may be clinically deleterious because it interferes with respiratory mechanics. This prospective comparison of patients with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia shows that despite considerable overlap in chest dimensions, patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia tend to have a distinctive chest deformity whose measured difference from control patients is statistically significant.\r"

Twenty-two of these patients had signs and symptoms suggesting brachial plexus tumor; 25 had known tumors that were juxtaposed to the brachial plexus but that could easily extend into the brachial plexus. These patients had no signs or symptoms. Using a 1.5-T clinical imaging system, we obtained single echo (T1- and T2-weighted) or double-echo (intermediate-weighted and T2-weighted) images in the coronal plane and supplemented these by images in the axial or sagittal planes. MR imaging encompassed the entire brachial plexus including roots, trunks, and cords. The imager body coil and a variety of surface coils were used for signal reception. MR findings were confirmed by surgery (n = 12) or response to radiation therapy on follow-up imaging (n = 3) in cases in which there was tumor involving the brachial plexus and by surgery (n = 9) or follow-up (n = 23) in cases in which there was no brachial plexus tumor. MR correctly identified all 15 cases of tumor involving the brachial plexus in patients with suggestive signs and symptoms; MR also correctly showed no tumor involvement in seven patients who had suggestive signs and symptoms. In 25 patients with no neurologic signs or symptoms, MR correctly identified tumor outside the brachial plexus that did not involve the brachial plexus. This study indicates that MR may have substantial clinical utility in evaluating patients for suspected brachial plexus tumor, particularly in patients with suggestive neurologic signs and symptoms.\r"

Eighteen of the 24 patients were found to have hemorrhagic neoplasms. Additional criteria, such as multiplicity of lesions and the presence of edema, were of some help in differentiating between occult vascular malformation and hemorrhagic neoplasm. In certain cases, CT was necessary to provide further information, such as the presence of calcification; however, an absolute and accurate diagnosis was impossible in several cases. The striking similarity on MR between cryptic vascular malformation and some hemorrhagic neoplasms is most likely due to the unifying mechanisms that underlie the evolution of extravascular intracerebral blood. Although the preponderance of neoplastic etiologies in our series may be partly due to the strong bias in our sample population toward patients with tumors, it seems clear that when an MR scan discloses findings \"typical\" of an occult vascular malformation, consideration must also be given to the generally more serious possibility of underlying neoplasm.\r"

Coronal MR imaging was carried out with two spin-echo (SE) sequences with a repetition time of 1600 msec and echo times of 35 or 70 msec (SE 1600/35, SE 1600/70). A focal lesion was detected by CT in 12 cases and by MR in 16 cases. If discrete attenuation or signal abnormalities are also taken into account, CT provided a positive finding in 13 cases and MR imaging in 20 cases. With the exception of a small calcification, all the lesions revealed on the CT scans were also detected on the MR images. Among the examinations assessable for temporal-lobe asymmetry, signs of a unilateral reduction in temporal-lobe size were seen on two of 35 CT scans and on 15 of 38 MR images. In three patients who had temporal-lobe resection, a subsequent comparison was made between CT, MR imaging, and pathology. Histologically proven glial reactions that could not be detected on CT were demonstrated as high-signal-intensity lesions on the SE 1600/70 image. We conclude that MR scanning, with its higher sensitivity, superior image quality, and ability of multiplanar imaging, should be the imaging technique of choice in the diagnosis of temporal-lobe epilepsy.\r"

In addition, MR offered several advantages over myelography in the evaluation of metastatic spinal disease, including demonstration of paravertebral tumor extension, identification of additional osseous metastatic lesions, and visualization of areas of spinal cord compression occurring between areas of myelographic blocks.

  ".W": "In an attempt to determine whether radiation therapy leads to an increased density of salivary glands on subsequent contrast-enhanced CT, 109 CT scans from 78 patients with head and neck tumors were reviewed. The density of parotid and submandibular glands was subjectively evaluated (compared with adjacent muscle) and correlated with treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Density of the parotid and/or submandibular glands was found to be significantly associated with previous irradiation on contrast-enhanced scans (p less than .05). One or both glands were denser than normal in seven (44%) of 16 patients who received only radiation therapy and in eight (38%) of 21 who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, compared with only two (10%) of 20 patients who received chemotherapy alone and two (4%) of 52 patients who received neither. The type or amount of irradiation, type of chemotherapy, or timing of the CT scan after the initiation of treatment was not found to be significant. We conclude that the density of the parotid and/or submandibular glands on contrast-enhanced CT is frequently increased after radiation therapy for tumors of the head and neck.\r"

  ".W": "Bradykinin, the end product of activation of the plasma contact system, may play a significant role in reactions to contrast material and in other forms of anaphylactoid and anaphylactic responses to drugs or antigens. Activation of factor XII initiates activity in the plasma contact system, and we have identified factors (negatively charged surfaces) present in elevated concentrations in the plasma of patients who are asthmatic or allergic that can \"prime\" their plasma for the initiation and/or potentiation of factor XII activation. In other studies, we have shown that persons who react to contrast material and persons who are asthmatic or allergic share both a potential for accelerated contact system activity and evidence of an increased mean concentration of low-level contact system products. Recently, we have found that contrast media can inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme, the substance that hydrolyzes bradykinin and limits its systemic effects. Thus, a number of factors suggest that it is the potential for increased production of bradykinin in persons who are allergic or asthmatic that may account for the greatly increased susceptibility of these patients to contrast material. This susceptibility may be critically triggered by the contrast media-induced inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme. In view of these findings, the possibility exists that most, if not all, significant reactions to contrast material require an underlying allergic diathesis that may, or may not, be apparent by history and conventional diagnostic testing.\r"

  ".W": "The arterial levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were estimated in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease in order to assess the catecholamine metabolism during pacing-induced angina pectoris and to evaluate the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Arterial levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine increased significantly during pacing to angina pectoris (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001, respectively), indicating that maximal atrial pacing induced an increase in sympathetic tone. At the corresponding pacing rate during TENS, myocardial lactate production was improved (p less than 0.01) and the ST segment depression was less pronounced (p less than 0.05). The maximal pacing rate during TENS was 141 +/- 24 compared to 123 +/- 19 (p less than 0.01) and the heart rate-blood pressure product was also significantly higher (p less than 0.01), suggesting an elevation of the anginal threshold by TENS. Systemic vascular resistance and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced (both p less than 0.01). These beneficial results may be caused by a decrease in left ventricular afterload as reflected by a fall in systolic blood pressure and may be explained by reduced sympathetic activity. TENS may decrease the sympathetic activity either directly or indirectly as a consequence of pain inhibition. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that arterial levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine dropped during TENS in TENS responders.\r"

Regional myocardial perfusion was assessed by rubidium-82. The study was repeated a few days later after intravenous infusion of isosorbide dinitrate. FDG uptake was similar in control subjects and patients with stable angina (0.023 +/- 0.032 vs 0.012 +/- 0.008 mol/ml/min, p less than 0.42) but was about 4-fold higher on the average in patients with unstable angina (0.084 +/- 0.047, p less than 0.01). The severity of coronary obstructions in stable and unstable angina patients was similar. The increased uptake involved the whole heart, including areas not distal to critically stenosed vessels; it was not associated with reduced myocardial perfusion and was not related to a recent episode of transient ischemia as assessed by symptoms and by Holter monitoring. After continuous infusion of nitrates, FDG uptake was consistently and significantly reduced toward normal levels both in areas perfused by critically stenosed coronary arteries and by noncritically stenosed vessels.\r"

Eighty-five patients with CAD proven by coronary angiography were studied. There were 73 men and 12 women aged 27 to 40 years. Fifty-nine patients presented with acute myocardial infarction, most of whom denied previous chest pain, and 14% (12 patients) presented with less acute chest pain syndromes. Coronary angiography was performed in all patients, and greater than or equal to 70% luminal diameter narrowing was considered significant. Coronary angiographic findings reveal 51% with 1-vessel CAD, 31% with 2-vessel and 19% with 3-vessel. Subsequently, 23 patients had coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 7 underwent angioplasty and 55 were treated medically. Follow-up for a mean of 3 years revealed only 1 death and 4 subsequent hospital admissions for cardiac events. Fifty-three percent of the patients are entirely pain free, and only 4 (5%) have significant symptoms of angina pectoris. Although 15 (18%) are not employed regularly, the remainder work full- or part-time, or plan to work in the near future. These data suggest that the short-term prognosis and functional status of young patients with CAD is excellent.\r"

According to the Working Formulation, 5 cases were low grade, 12 intermediate grade, and 5 high grade; 1 case was an extramedullary plasmocytoma. Forty-seven percent were large cell lymphomas and 13% follicular lymphomas. There were 20 (86%) B-cell lymphomas and 2 T-cell lymphomas; one case lacked detectable markers for B-, T-, or histiocytic cells. Monoclonality was demonstrated in 13 out of the 20 B-cell lymphomas, whereas the other 7 expressed pan-B antigens.

Thrombin (20 U/ml) and sodium morrhuate 5% were used in sequence as sclerosants on 34 occasions. In the remaining 21 sessions, sodium morrhuate 5% alone was used. Conventional coagulation tests did not change significantly after EVS, regardless of the type of treatment. Basal plasma FPA levels were abnormally high in about 50% of patients. After EVS, plasma FPA increased sharply in 37/39 patients (95%), returning to baseline values in most of them within 24 h. We conclude that transient systemic activation of blood coagulation occurs after EVS. Such activation can be detected only by sensitive methods such as FPA assay, and has no effect on conventional coagulation tests. This, and the absence of any clinical EVS-related coagulation disorder in our patients, suggests that activation of coagulation should not be a major concern for patients undergoing EVS.\r"

To date, almost no nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug has been shown to be devoid of that side effect in a strictly controlled study. The objective of this study was to assess quantitatively, by use of radioactive chromium (chromium-51)-labeled red blood cells, gastrointestinal blood loss associated with nabumetone (1,000 mg daily), aspirin (3.6 g daily), and placebo. A total of 37 normal subjects, divided among the three treatment groups and a fourth group that received no treatment, were assessed clinically and quantitatively for gastrointestinal blood loss over a period of 28 days of \"active\" treatment. The results with chromium-51, analyzed on a logarithmic scale, revealed no statistically significant differences between the nabumetone, placebo, and control groups. Gastrointestinal blood loss in the aspirin group, however, was elevated when compared with all other groups at a high level of statistical significance (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that, under conditions in which aspirin causes substantial gastrointestinal microbleeding, nabumetone is not significantly different from placebo.\r"

The therapeutic index was found to be 50% higher than that of Althesin and 6-8 times higher than those of propofol, thiopentone and midazolam. Induction with pregnanolone emulsion was reliable and fast, with only minor excitatory side effects, although induction time was longer compared to Althesin, propofol and thiopentone. Movement of unstimulated rats during sleep was similar to that seen with Althesin but movement on painful stimulation was less than with propofol and thiopentone. Recovery was rapid and smooth, and the proportion of sleeping time to recovery time was higher than found for the other four anaesthetics. No cumulative effects were seen on repeated administration and there were no venous sequelae. The results indicate that pregnanolone emulsion may provide a short-acting, less cumulative and less toxic alternative to existing intravenous anaesthetic agents.\r"

Arterial blood samples were collected at selected times during and up to 8 hr after infusion. Whole blood propofol concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Using a non-linear least-squares regression analysis, the individual data sets were best fitted by a three-compartment open mamillary model with central elimination in 17 patients. In one patient a biexponential equation was more appropriate. Derived pharmacokinetic parameters expressed as mean values +/- SD indicated an initial fast distribution (t1/2 pi; 2.8 +/- 1.2 min), with an intermediate phase (t1/2 alpha; 31.4 +/- 14.7 min), and a long terminal phase (t1/2 beta; 355 +/- 227 min), a large volume of distribution at steady state (Vss, 287 +/- 213 L), and a high blood clearance (Clb, 1.7 +/- 0.3 L/min). The function of drug in the central compartment in the terminal phase was low (Fc, 0.02). The elimination rate constant (K10, 0.1190 +/- 0.0351 min-1) was large compared with the other transfer rate constants and was responsible for the large amount of drug eliminated during distribution. The fraction of drug eliminated during the terminal phase amounted to 0.28. The slow return of drug from remote tissues (K31, 0.0033 +/- 0.0013 min-1) was rate limiting in the ultimate elimination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In two patients, serial ophthalmoscopic evaluations documented cessation of active retinitis although at autopsy one patient had evidence of active retinitis adjacent to scar. Reappearance of cotton-wool spots in the fundi of the third patient suggested an early relapse of his CMV infection which was halted by retreatment with ganciclovir. Two of the three patients developed breakthrough infection while receiving once-daily maintenance therapy after periods of three to five months. One patient continued to show a response to retreatment with full doses twelve months later but died after 17 months of progressive CMV disease. The dose of the drug needed to maintain remission requires further study.\r"

The mean blastogenic value in PHA stimulated patient lymphocyte cultures was similar to that calculated in the controls. In contrast, the mitogenic response of lymphocytes from patients with Down's syndrome to anti-CD3 stimulation was on average significantly reduced. Immunofluorescence studies and additional experiments carried out by using semiallogeneic (maternal) monocytes as a source of antigen presenting cells showed that the impaired anti-CD3 induced mitogenesis in Down's syndrome could not be ascribed either to a lack of binding of the antibody to the trisomic cells, or to a defective monocyte-T cell interaction. These findings help to explain the cellular basis of the immune defect in Down's syndrome.\r"

Antigens expressed by the endothelium can act to promote and be the target of rejection reactions, which often lead to thrombosis and ischemic necrosis of the allograft. In this study, segments of femoral artery and femoral vein with or without endothelium were grafted between allogenic or autologous control rats. Immunocompetent Lewis (RT1(1] recipient rats were randomly selected for groups (N = 14 for each) receiving the following: ACI- (RT1a) allografts with intact endothelium, allografts with endothelium removed before operation, autografts with endothelium, and autografts with endothelium removed. Rejection was assessed by graft patency as well as morphologic and ultrastructural changes. At 5 days, the allografts with intact endothelium were totally occluded, whereas allografts without endothelium remained patent, as did autologous control grafts with or without endothelium. Two additional groups (N = 14 each) receiving the de-endothelialized allografts or autografts were examined at 120 days after operation, revealing that grafts in both groups were still patent and had been re-endothelialized. These findings indicate that physical removal of vascular endothelium may depress vessel allograft rejection without immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

In-hospital mortality for MVR + CABG was 13.2% (10/76); it was 8.6% (6/70) when patients with preoperative mechanical support were excluded, 7.9% (5/63) for elective operations, and 8.2% (5/61) for nonischemic mitral disease. Overall, in-hospital mortality for isolated MVR was 6.3% (11/175); it was 4.4% (7/161) excluding patients requiring mechanical support and 3.1% (5/157) for elective operations. Of a host of clinical characteristics in patients with MVR +CABG, few were found to influence in-hospital mortality: age greater than 60 years, degree of incapacitation (New York Heart Association Functional Class IV), previous history of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, cardiac enlargement (cardiothoracic index greater than 50%), and ischemic mitral disease (33.3% in-hospital mortality; p less than 0.05). Of the invasive variables, only one influenced in-hospital mortality: wall motion score greater than 10 (31.6% in-hospital mortality; p less than 0.01). Of the operative variables studied, the number of grafts (3 or more: 33.3% in-hospital mortality; p less than 0.05), the need for mechanical support (47.4% in-hospital mortality; p less than 0.0001), and emergency operation (38.5% in-hospital mortality; p less than 0.005) had a significant effect on mortality. The type of mitral lesion, the type of prosthesis, the extent of CAD or the completeness of revascularization, the presence of pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation appeared to have no influence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was undertaken to determine what factors might predispose to MI following emergency CABG for failed PTCA. Since 1980, 24 patients at Boston University Medical Center have undergone emergency CABG following failed PTCA. In 15 patients (63%), there was postoperative evidence of an MI shown by either ECG or enzyme criteria. Variables that predisposed to a perioperative MI (p less than 0.05) included multivessel PTCA, the presence of multiple vessels with 50% stenosis or more, multivessel CABG, and the presence of new ECG changes immediately following failed PTCA. Variables that did not discriminate between the two groups included age, sex, the specific vessel involved during PTCA, or a previous history of MI. The presence of coronary collaterals did not decrease the incidence of MI. This study suggests that patients with multiple major coronary stenoses in whom acute ECG changes develop following failed PTCA are more likely to sustain a perioperative MI following emergency CABG.\r"

After an unsuccessful supraclavicular approach, left-sided standard thoracotomy showed thick adhesions around the LIMA takeoff with a diffuse oozing rather than an identifiable discrete leak. A possible leaking point was stitched, the area was sealed with fibrin adhesive, and complete remission ensued. Operation for chylothorax after LIMA takedown is challenging. A left-sided standard thoracotomy with minimal dissection and use of fibrin adhesive rather than blind stitching are recommended.\r"

Only five study patients (8%) developed bright-red blood per nasogastric tube; four patients received the antacid regimen and one received cimetidine. None of the patients receiving sucralfate developed acute upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Bleeding was not severe enough in any patient to require endoscopy or surgery. There were no significant differences in the three groups when several major risk factors for gastrointestinal tract bleeding were analyzed, including sepsis, hypotension, steroid use, adult respiratory distress syndrome, gastric pH of 4 or less, previous peptic ulcer disease, peritonitis, and jaundice. A significantly higher incidence of acute renal failure was noted in the antacid-treated group when compared with the cimetidine and sucralfate groups. We find preliminary evidence that sucralfate is as efficacious as and more cost-effective than either cimetidine or antacids for prophylaxis of stress-related gastrointestinal tract bleeding in the critically ill ventilator-dependent patient.\r"

Thirty-five subjects complained of systemic symptoms suggestive of HIV infection and 65 were completely asymptomatic. Irrespective of symptoms, the group as a whole demonstrated clinical and laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency. Eighty had generalized lymphadenopathy, 16 onychomycosis, six oral candidiasis, and two biopsy-proved Kaposi's sarcoma. Seventy-seven were anergic to seven intradermal antigens. Despite normal white blood cell counts in most subjects, the T-helper-cell count was less than 300/mm3 in 48% of asymptomatic and 46% of symptomatic subjects. The degree of immune depression was less severe but approximated that of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome after Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. We believe these findings justify the need for comprehensive medical evaluation and follow-up care for seropositive persons from alternate test sites.\r"

  ".W": "There is a common belief that administration of anticoagulants to patients with brain tumors is contraindicated. Between 1982 and 1986, 50 patients with deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli and brain tumors were examined and treated. Twenty-four patients received an inferior vena cava Greenfield filter and 25 patients were treated with anticoagulants. One patient was terminal and received no therapy. Patients in each group were similar with regard to age, sex, primary tumor, computed tomographic findings, and ultimate outcome. At the time of diagnosis, all patients had residual tumor and most had significant cerebral edema and midline shift. There were no complications in the group receiving Greenfield filters. One patient had a pulmonary embolus after the filter was placed and later required anticoagulant therapy. In the group receiving anticoagulants, one patient had focal intraventricular bleeding observed incidentally on computed tomographic scan one month after beginning anticoagulant therapy and was totally asymptomatic. One patient had gastrointestinal tract bleeding five days after beginning anticoagulant therapy with heparin sodium, and the therapy was therefore discontinued. No other patient had significant bleeding. In view of these findings, a reevaluation of anticoagulant therapy in patients with central nervous system tumors is warranted.\r"

To determine if TIL NK function can be reactivated in vivo, 11 patients with tumors metastatic to the lung were treated with systemic recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2). Spontaneous TIL NK activity and NK activity after three days' incubation with 100 U/mL of rIL-2 were increased in patients receiving 15,000 U/kg of rIL-2 preoperatively compared with those receiving between 1000 and 10,000 U/kg. Histologically, higher doses of rIL-2 increased the number of intratumoral lymphocytes, the level of peritumoral lymphocytic transferrin, and the expression of HLA-DR. Spontaneous PBL NK activity in patients receiving between 10,000 and 15,000 U/kg of rIL-2 was also increased and was further increased by in vitro culture with rIL-2. Thus, PBL NK activity and TIL NK function in vivo can be augmented with 15,000 U/kg of systemic rIL-2. Both TIL- and PBL-inducible cytotoxicities were further enhanced by in vitro culture with rIL-2.\r"

Animals were treated with the following: (1) intravitreal antibiotics alone; (2) intravitreal antibiotics with vitrectomy; (3) vitrectomy alone; and (4) no treatment. Eyes treated with antibiotics and vitrectomy displayed significantly clearer media at 14 days after therapy compared with eyes treated with antibiotics alone. There was also a greater tendency for eyes treated with antibiotics and vitrectomy to have negative cultures at 14 days, although this difference was not statistically significant. These findings are consistent with beneficial effects of therapeutic vitrectomy as an adjunct to intravitreal antibiotic therapy in an animal model of aphakic bacterial endophthalmitis.\r"

Intraocular inflammation was less severe and formation of conjugated dienes and malonaldehyde was significantly inhibited in animals treated with the enzyme antioxidants or dimethyl thiourea.

When compared with HLA findings in 243 healthy controls, HLA-DR4 was increased in patients with GCA and PMR, but not in patients with GCA alone. Pooled analysis of data from 4 published papers confirmed the association of DR4 with GCA and PMR (P much less than 0.00001). Patients with PMR but negative findings of temporal artery biopsies also showed an increased frequency of HLA-DR4, but this did not reach statistical significance, probably because of the small number of subjects. It is likely that the increased frequency of DR4 in GCA patients is related to its association with PMR.\r"

Excitatory effects were observed in 10 children (33%) receiving propofol as opposed to five children (16%) after thiopentone, but these were transient and minor and all occurred after completion of injection. Apnoea lasting longer than 30 s occurred in only four children (13%) in each group despite the use of opioid premedication. The mean duration of apnoea was similar in both groups. Propofol caused greater decreases in arterial pressures (systolic, diastolic, mean) than thiopentone, but only the difference in systolic arterial pressure achieved significance. There was a significant difference in heart rate, which did not change after propofol, but increased with thiopentone.

Immediately after the operation, the uterus was opened under sterile conditions and samples obtained from the isthmus and fundus of the uterine cavity were examined microbiologically. In all three patients G. vaginalis was grown in pure culture from the fundus. Serum antibody titres against G. vaginalis were significantly raised in all three patients, and histology revealed mononuclear cells in the endometrium. The isolation of G. vaginalis from the endometrium of patients with clinical and histological signs of inflammation and with antibodies to G. vaginalis in serum indicates that the organism may play a causative role in endometritis.\r"

The ophthalmologist should screen patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus for antibodies against HTLV-III in areas where this virus is endemic or if the patient belongs to a known risk group. If the test is positive, the patient should be instructed about the infectious nature of his condition to prevent spread of this sexually transmitted disease. As the rate of corneal involvement and postherpetic neuralgia are very high in these patients, it would be worthwhile to ascertain whether routine use of acyclovir treatment in HTLV-III seropositive patients with herpes zoster has a beneficial effect on these complications.\r"

The retinitis responded to dihydroxy propoxy methyl guanine (DHPG) but relapsed four to six weeks after each course of treatment with progressive retinal destruction. One relapse was therefore treated with trisodium phosphoformate hexahydrate (Foscarnet). There are few reports of the use of this drug in the treatment of CMV retinitis with AIDS, but it appeared to be less effective in our patient than DHPG, possibly because of poor penetration of the blood-ocular barrier. A final course of outpatient maintenance therapy with DHPG failed to prevent a preterminal relapse of the retinitis. Fundus photographs demonstrated the resolution and relapse of the retinitis associated with each course of treatment. Maintenance therapy with DHPG would appear to be necessary to prevent relapse, but the logistics of this are difficult, and the effective dosage of DHPG is as yet uncertain.\r"

From December, 1980, to December, 1986, 969 women aged 61 (32-84) years and 2,727 men aged 57 (27-84) years underwent PTCA, at our institution. At the time of PTCA 26% of the women had functional class IV angina pectoris compared to 16% of the men (P less than 0.005). Women more often had hypertension (56% vs 39%), left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus (19% vs 11%; P less than 0.0005), and family history of coronary artery disease than men. Significantly more of the men (74%) smoked than did the women (53%). The success rate in women was 93% as compared to an angiographic success rate in 2,727 men of 93.5% (ns). The rate of emergency bypass surgery in women was 3.8% as compared to 3.2% in men (ns). The death rate was 0.3% in women as compared to 0.09% in men. Women underwent more PTCA of the left anterior descending coronary artery (52% vs 48% of lesions in men; P less than 0.05) and right coronary artery (32% vs 27% in men; P less than 0.0005). Fewer of the women (9%) had had previous bypass surgery than had the men (15% P less than 0.0005). Procedural details, including balloon diameter, vessel diameter, lesion response pressure, inflation number, and maximum inflation pressures used as PTCA, were not different between men and women. Women had significantly more ST segment shift of 1 mm of more at the time of balloon inflation than men (P less than 0.0005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum 1,25(OH)2D rose in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 administration and fell when vitamin D2 was given alone. Serum osteocalcin rose in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 administration. Serum 25OHD rose in response to vitamin D2 administration regardless of whether the subjects also received 1,25(OH)2D3. The data from this study in humans support the suggestion that the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on serum 25OHD concentrations are mediated through mechanisms other than impairment of production.\r"

Measurements of T-lymphocyte surface ferritin using flow cytometry show that phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation causes a marked increase in the number of cells bearing spleen-type (S) and heart-type (H) ferritin on their membrane, whereas no such change occurs in non-stimulated cells. This coincides with increases in interleukin-2 receptors, transferrin receptors and HLA-DR antigen. 2. There is an increase in the intracellular concentration of both S- and H-ferritin in lymphocytes after PHA stimulation: H-ferritin increases five- to seven-fold, but S-ferritin only two-to three-fold. The maximum H/S ratio is about 15/1. However, these increases also occur in cells cultured in the absence of PHA. 3. Small amounts of both S- and H-ferritin are released into the medium, especially from stimulated cells, but the H/S ratios are lower than intracellular ratios. 4. The present findings suggest that lymphocyte stimulation followed by ferritin synthesis is accompanied by an increase in the amount of intracellular and cell surface ferritin and, possibly, the amount released from the cells.\r"

Thirteen patients (68%) were 60 years or older when the liver disease was discovered. The mean age of the patients with the ZZ, SZ, and MZ phenotypes was 58, 66, and 72.5 years, respectively; this suggested a later onset of the liver disease in the heterozygotes. At the time of diagnosis, the hepatic condition usually was advanced; in eight patients (42%) the survival was less than two years. The most important associated condition was chronic obstructive lung disease which was found in 10 patients (53%). We conclude that advanced age and the high incidence of obstructive lung disease make it unlikely that liver transplantation will become a common therapeutic option for adult patients with A1AT deficiency and associated liver disease. Periodic screening of liver function may be indicated in patients with A1AT deficiency so that chronic liver disease can be diagnosed early, particularly if current attempts to develop effective medical therapy for this condition are successful.\r"

These effects were compared to those produced by intracerebroventricular administration of ovine corticotropin releasing factor (oCRF). Beginning 40-50 min after the occurrence of a gastric migrating motor complex (MMC), a 1-hr hearing of prerecorded intense music through earpieces (less than 100 dB) delayed the occurrence of the next gastric MMC observed after 2.8 +/- 1.2 hr, while jejunal MMC were still present at a normal frequency. During AS, heart rate and plasma cortisol were significantly increased by 32.7 and 215%, respectively, 10-15 min after the beginning of hearing. The AS-induced lengthening of the gastric MMC cycle as well as cortisol increase were abolished after previous administration of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg intramuscular) or muscimol (10 micrograms/kg intravenous), while they were still present after naloxone (0.1 mg/kg intravenous), phentolamine (0.2 mg/kg intravenous), or propranolol (0.1 mg/kg intravenous). CRF administered intracerebroventricularly (100 ng/kg) also delayed the occurrence of gastric MMC without affecting jejunal motility, and this effect was not antagonized by previous treatment with diazepam or muscimol. Both the effects of AS and CRF were abolished after bilateral thoracic vagotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Small bowel transplantation (SBT) has been carried out in man in several cases without success, because immunologic problems were unsolved. In experimental SBT a 'two step' model was developed, which enables long term observation of immunologic phenomena. In this model the graft is in a heterotopic position to the recipient's own small bowel. After 35 days the recipient's own bowel is removed and replaced by the graft, now in orthotopic position and again in contact with luminal chymus. To investigate functional and morphological changes, which result from the procedure, the resorption of glucose and water was measured in syngeneic transplanted rats by an in vivo recirculation system and the mucosa was evaluated three dimensionally. The graft mucosa showed a significant reduction in villus height, crypt length and villus surface and a corresponding decrease in glucose and water absorption during heterotopic position. If the graft came into the orthotopic position, the mucosa did regenerate which was expressed by the significant longer crypts of the graft compared with those of the controls, although the graft's villus height and surface are still smaller. Glucose and water absorption increased and were higher in orthotopic transplanted animals, when absorption was expressed per unit intestinal length. The results indicate that in the 'two step' model of SBT the absorption of water and glucose is influenced to such an extent, that recovery is possible after three weeks, thus enabling orthotopic SBT. This almost complete recovery of the mucosa is further evidence of the regeneratory capacity of the small bowel, which enables clinical small bowel transplantation.\r"

The crypt cell production rate was measured in animals maintained parenterally with or without urogastrone, and in rats fed a standard laboratory ration. Continuous infusion of 15 micrograms per rat per day of recombinant beta urogastrone (a dose which has a minimal effect on gastric acid secretion) significantly increased cell proliferation and intestinal tissue weights throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Intravenous infusion of urogastrone was also effective in restoring cell proliferation when it was infused after the intestine had become hypoproliferative. Urogastrone administered through an intragastric cannula thrice daily had no significant effect on either intestinal weight, crypt cell production rate, or metaphase collection.\r"

The r alpha-1-AT was produced in yeast transformed with an expressing plasmid containing a full-length human alpha-1-AT complementary deoxyribonucleic acid and purified to greater than 99% homogeneity. The r alpha-1-AT has a molecular weight of 45,000, no carbohydrates, and is identical in sequence to normal plasma alpha-1-AT except for an additional N-terminal acetylmethionine. Despite its lack of carbohydrates, the r alpha-1-AT inhibited human neutrophil elastase with an association rate constant similar to that of p alpha-1-AT. Rhesus monkeys were infused intravenously with 120 mg/kg of r alpha-1-AT (n = 13) or p alpha-1-AT (n = 12) and the serum, urine, and lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations of these molecules quantified at various intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied in unanesthetized rabbits the effects of intravenous divided dose infusions of a murine monokine preparation containing IL-1 activity, on circulating granulocytes, their sequestration within the pulmonary microvasculature, pulmonary edema formation, and changes in pulmonary vascular permeability. Monokine administration induced significant (P less than 0.01) granulocytopenia as well as a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in mean alveolar septal wall granulocytes per high power field (HPF) compared with saline-injected controls. Infusions of the monokine preparation significantly (P less than 0.005) increased lung wet-to-dry weight ratios as well as significantly (P less than 0.025) increased pulmonary extravasation of radiolabeled albumin. Electron microscopic analysis of lung sections obtained from monokine-infused animals demonstrated endothelial injury, perivascular edema, and extravasation of an ultrastructural tracer. We conclude that a monokine preparation containing IL-1 activity can induce profound granulocytopenia, pulmonary leukostasis, and acute pulmonary vascular endothelial injury.\r"

Ninety one paired biopsy and cytology specimens from 72 of these patients were analysed. There was no significant difference between biopsy and cytology in diagnosing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (0.95 greater than p greater than 0.1). In 10 cases P carinii pneumonia was diagnosed by biopsy but not cytology and in seven cases by cytology but not biopsy. Nineteen patients had multiple infections or Kaposi's sarcoma. Biopsy was more useful than cytology in the diagnosis of other infections (n = 20) and Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 2) with positive cytological correlation in only three of the infections. Biopsy and cytology together have a diagnostic yield of 78.3%. We conclude that all patients presenting with respiratory disease who have, or are in a high risk group for, AIDS should be examined by bronchoscopy at an early stage with both cytology and biopsy.\r"

  ".U": "88088739\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently described three \"immature\" B cell lymphomas which are exquisitely sensitive to growth inhibition by anti-Ig reagents and may serve as models for tolerance induction in normal B cells. These cells are inhibited from cell cycle progression into S after receiving a negative signal in early G1. In this paper, we demonstrate that the growth inhibition by anti-Ig can be prevented and reversed by the addition of supernatants from T cell lines. One such line, called Tova, produces factors which restore normal levels of DNA synthesis in the presence of concentrations of anti-Fab or anti-kappa immunoglobulins which cause up to a 90% inhibition of thymidine incorporation in a 2- to 3-day culture period. This factor is at least partially effective when added up to 24 hr after anti-Ig to unsynchronized lymphoma cells and it does not alter the growth of control cultures. Studies using synchronized lymphoma cells indicated that the T cell factor permitted cycle progression into S when added during the early G1 exposure to anti-kappa and was less effective when added late in G1. Preliminary characterization suggests that both B cell growth factor II (interleukin 5) and B cell stimulatory factor 1 (interleukin 4) have additive activity in this system, although another unidentified lymphokine may also be involved. The relevance of T cell reversal of Ig receptor-mediated negative signaling to neonatal B cell tolerance is emphasized.\r"

In the present study, CD4 and CD8 were modified by increased phosphorylation when T cell clones or T cells were either exposed to phorbol-12-myristate- 13-acetate or were triggered via the CD3-T cell receptor complex. Activation of T cells through the CD2 sheep erythrocyte binding protein, using anti-T11(2) and -T11(3) antibodies, also resulted in CD4 and CD8 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that signals derived from two different receptor pathways can converge and result in similar molecular modifications of CD4 and CD8. Furthermore, phorbol myristate acetate treatment or activation via the CD2 pathway induced phosphorylation of the CD4 and CD8 molecules of thymocytes, suggesting that these molecules may be functional in thymus. Together, our findings indicate that CD4 and CD8 phosphorylation is a consequence of T cell triggering, and suggest that CD4 and CD8 phosphorylation may represent a molecular signaling mechanism among the CD3-T cell receptor complex, CD2, CD4, and CD8.\r"

  ".W": "This study demonstrated that antisuppressor T cells (TAS) were generated in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) when supplemented with a conditioned medium containing T cell differentiation factor (CM-TCDF). CM-TCDF was shown to efficiently restore the alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) response in accessory cell-depleted MLC. CM-TCDF could also sustain the growth and cytotoxic activity of bulk-cultured CTL. In contrast, cloned CTL only required interleukin 2 to maintain their growth and cytotoxic activity. These findings suggested that bulk-cultured MLC might contain different populations of immunoregulatory cells in addition to CTL effectors. These immunoregulatory cells provide \"on\" or \"off\" signals to turn on or turn off the lytic machinery of CTL. The suppressor T cells (Ts) generated in MLC might provide the \"off\" signal to CTL that resulted in the termination of their cytotoxic activity after 7 days of culturing. When CM-TCDF was supplemented in MLC, we found that TAS were generated. TAS could efficiently abrogate the suppressor activity of anti-allo-TS, but they had no effect on the anti-self veto cell activity. Both the TAS and TS activities were allospecific. The precursors and effectors of TAS were both found to be L3T4+ cells, whereas the TS effectors were Lyt-2+ cells. Generation of TAS was completely blocked by alpha L3T4 antibody and was partially blocked by alpha Thy-1 antibody. In contrast, alpha Lyt-2 antibody or antibodies against class II major histocompatibility complex framework determinants had no effect on TAS generation. Therefore, TAS were different from L3T4+ T helper cells that were induced in the context of recognizing class II major histocompatibility complex determinants. TAS might represent a separate set of immunoregulatory cells that provide an \"off\" signal to the TS, which allowed the lytic machinery of the CTL to remain active and, thus, to maintain their cytotoxic activity for a prolonged period of time.\r"

However, although the MR3-2 mAb inhibited the lysis of either Db + H-Y or H-2d targets by OH8, the MR3-6 mAb inhibited the lysis of H-2d target cells, but not that of Db + H-Y target cells. Modulation of T cell receptor by either MR3-2 or MR3-6 mAb rendered the OH8 cytolytic T lymphocyte incapable of killing both Db + H-Y and H-2d target cells. These findings suggest that different epitopes of OH8 T cell receptor were involved for the recognition of self + antigen and alloantigen.\r"

Among 28 independent cell lines from a single animal we find that 21 of them fall into seven small families of from two to five members; only seven lines have no matches among the set. A statistical analysis determines that the number of genetically distinct B cell precursors whose progeny were isolated during this secondary response is 18, with 95% confidence limits of 14 and 26. The distribution of family sizes implies that each activated clone has proliferated to approximately the same extent. Complete sequencing of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain mRNA from 19 of the cell lines reveals many shared somatic mutations among related lines, implying a pronounced founder effect has occurred to eliminate most of the progeny of each precursor B cell. This may be the result either of a high frequency of debilitating somatic mutation or from selection against cells still expressing the idiotype of primary anti-(4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl antibodies.\r"

In addition to expressing the L3T4 marker, as detected by anti-L3T4 antibody and complement-mediated elimination, the L3T4+ CTL are inhibited by L3T4 antibody. The observation of these L3T4+ CTL in cells recovered from primary mixed lymphocyte reactions confirms the previous reports. However it is demonstrated for the first time that a subpopulation of these are class I-specific by their specific inhibition with an antiserum to class I antigens. The class I specificity of the CTL was further shown by their ability to kill class II antigen negative P815 tumor cells. The lysis of this target cell by L3T4+ CTL was also specifically blocked by the class I antiserum. The data is consistent with the presence also of a class II-specific population of L3T4+ cytotoxic cells. The fact that a level of L3T4+ cell-mediated cytotoxic activity comparable to Ly-2+ cytolytic activity is generated in a primary mixed lymphocyte response, even though the precursor frequency of L3T4+ killer cells is 10 times lower than for Ly-2+ killers, is suggestive of their physiologic significance. It was also shown that the activation of these cells is not dependent on the presence of xenogeneic serum components or exogenous helper or mitogenic factors in the culture medium. The findings provide further evidence against both the phenotype-function and phenotype-major histocompatibility complex antigen specificity models of T cell diversity.\r"

In addition to cellular immune reactions, humoral factors such as antibodies might quantitatively or qualitatively influence the disease process. We therefore investigated the effects of administration of a monoclonal antibody specific for a CNS autoantigen on both acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice and rats. This monoclonal antibody, 8-18C5, specific for a myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, was observed to accelerate clinical and pathologic changes of CNS autoimmune disease. In SJL mice with chronic relapsing EAE, injection of antibody into animals recovering from an attack induced fatal relapses; in Lewis rats, acute EAE was enhanced and associated with a hyperacute inflammatory response with demyelination, a feature not commonly seen in acute EAE. The demonstration that relapses and demyelination can be induced by administration of a white matter-reactive monoclonal antibody offers new possibilities to study processes resulting in CNS damage during autoimmune disease. Furthermore, these findings support the immunopathogenic potential of antibody to myelin components in inflammatory CNS disease processes and, specifically, in causing demyelination.\r"

The antibody specifically stains cells infected with HIV, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence analysis and reacts with determinants displayed on the surface of infected cells. In Western blot analysis, the antibody reacts with bands of 160 and 41 kD, consistent with the precursor and transmembrane forms of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. The antibody also reacts specifically in immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis with cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus VSC-25, which contains the envelope gene of HIV. With the lambda gt11 expression vector, the epitope recognized by 1B8.env was mapped to a region of 11 amino acids in the coding region of gp41. This domain is highly conserved between several otherwise highly variable HIV isolates. In addition, this epitope appears to be recognized by the vast majority of HIV seropositive individuals. Although antibody IB8.env does not neutralize HIV virion infectivity or virally mediated cell fusion, the results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of generating and characterizing human monoclonal antibodies to HIV with these techniques. Additional antibodies produced in this manner will help to further characterize the humoral response to HIV infection, define biologically significant determinants on HIV proteins, and may be useful in clinical applications.\r"

In this study, one such clone (HE1-11) was tested for the presence of mRNA hybridizing with a cDNA probe coding for Fc epsilon R on B cells. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of the same 1.7 kb Fc epsilon R mRNA in HE1-11 and in RPMI 8866 cells as well as in the macrophage cell line U937, expressing Fc epsilon R. The IgE binding factors (BF) released by HE1-11 cells appeared to be identical to those released by RPMI 8866 cells as shown by 1) one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and 2) tryptic peptides analysis. IgE-BF are microheterogeneous containing molecules with molecular mass of 25 to 27 kDa and with isoelectric point ranging from 4.5 to 5.

In an immunofluorescence assay with fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, we studied the binding of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Leu 4 to monocytes from responders and nonresponders. Interaction was observed with monocytes from responders only, and was blocked by a murine monoclonal antibody (IV.3) directed to an epitope on the 40-kDa low affinity Fc receptor (FcRII). This indicates that the interaction represents binding of the Fc part of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Leu 4 to FcRII on responder monocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence with antibody IV.3 demonstrated, however, that monocytes from both responders and nonresponders express similar levels of FcRII. Thus, nonresponder monocytes apparently express a variant FcRII which is unable to bind the Fc part of mIgG1 antibodies. The anti-FcRII antibody completely blocked anti-Leu 4-induced (but not OKT3 (mIgG2a)-induced) T cell proliferation in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from responders. The results provide direct evidence that monocytes from anti-Leu 4 responders, but not monocytes from anti-Leu 4 non-responders, are able to bind the Fc part of mIgG1 to FcRII, and that this interaction with FcRII is essential for the mitogenic activity of mIgG1 anti-CD3 antibodies.\r"

However, very few EqT6+ and EqT7+ resident cortical thymocytes were detected. The near absence of EqT6+ and EqT7+ cortical thymocytes was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of thymic tissue from SCID foals. Those cells present were larger than normal cortical thymocytes. Furthermore, their activities of adenosine deaminase, adenosine monophosphate-deaminase, and 5' nucleotidase differed from those of normal cortical thymocytes. The combined evidence of monoclonal antibody analysis, size parameters, and purine enzyme activities demonstrate the near absence of cortical thymocytes in horses with this genetically defined immunodeficiency disorder.\r"

On size exclusion chromatography (TSK-4000), C1 IA-C1r-C1s and C1 IA-C1r-C1s-C1 IA emerged with apparent m.w. of 320,000 and 460,000, respectively. The composition of the complexes was examined by absorption of serum with F(ab')2 anti-C1s- or anti-C1r-coated Sepharose beads. Eluates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with immunoblotting. Under nonreducing conditions, heat-aggregated IgG-treated serum showed high concentrations of C1 IA-C1r (m.w. 202,000) and C1 IA-C1s (m.w. 194,000), while serum incubated at 37 degrees C without activators showed high concentrations of C1 IA-C1r but no C1 IA-C1s. Under reducing conditions, heat-aggregated IgG-treated serum showed m.w. 120,000 and 110,000 complexes of C1 IA and the C1r and C1s light chains, respectively. Uncleaved C1s and the m.w. 120,000 complex was found in serum that was incubated at 37 degrees C without activators. Consistent with results obtained by size exclusion chromatography, analysis by crossed immunoelectrophoresis and by electroimmunoassay showed that C1s could be released from C1 IA-C1r-C1s in the presence of EDTA.\r"

  ".W": "The murine macrophage and lymphocyte Fc receptor for aggregated IgG (Fc gamma R) has previously been characterized by using the anti-Fc gamma R monoclonal antibody (mAb), 2.4G2. In the studies presented here, we describe a new mAb, 6B7C, that defines a second epitope of the Fc gamma R. The tissue distribution of the 6B7C epitope is coincident with the 2.4G2 epitope. However, only the 2.4G2 epitope is accessible to mAb binding on intact primary macrophages or lymphocytes. The 6B7C epitope is not detectable on primary macrophages or lymphocytes but is exposed on a portion of B lymphocyte Fc gamma R after activation by lipopolysaccharide and on some tumor cell lines. The expression of the 6B7C epitope on the surface of B lymphoblasts and tumor cell lines seems to correlate with their ability to release soluble Fc gamma R. The 6B7C mAb has the advantage that it reacts with native as well as denatured receptor and therefore can be used for techniques such as immunoblotting.\r"

In the mitogen-driven system one of 130 T cell blasts developed clonal progenies able to lyse specifically HSV-infected syngeneic targets. In the antigen-driven system HSV-specific CTL-p could be detected in normal lymphocytes provided the stimulator cells used were enriched for dendritic cells and pulsed with high concentrations of heat-inactivated HSV. Depending on the mouse strain used, the frequencies of HSV-specific CTL-p ranged from 1/500 to 1/10,000 in normal mice. Upon antigen priming within local lymph node cells, an increase of frequencies from 1/500 to 1/170 was observed in CBA/Ca mice.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of the biologic consequences of using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with specificity for I-A for the elimination of an I-A-bearing B cell lymphoma, it was found that, despite the presence of I-A on a number of normal cell types and the propensity of anti-I-A to induce modulation of I-A and I-E on normal cells in vivo, a substantial effect on lymphoma growth could be measured in mAb-treated hosts. Unlike I-A on normal cells, tumor I-A failed to modulate in vivo, and 50% of animals could be cured of lymphoma by multiple doses of anti-I-A mAb. With a sensitive spleen tumor colonization assay, it was shown that neither T lymphocytes nor natural killer cells were involved in tumor elimination by anti-I-A mAb. In addition, C3 depletion only minimally affected the ability of anti-I-A to inhibit tumor growth, suggesting that complement-dependent lysis of tumor cells was not a major mechanism. Spleen cells from long term survivors of tumor challenge and mAb treatment functioned normally as antigen-presenting cells and in the recognition of alloantigens, and serum Ig levels were somewhat higher than in untreated mice; thus, such therapy can be carried out without compromising the immune reactivity of long term survivors.\r"

In addition, an assessment of post-nasal obstruction was made and this too was compared with middle-ear status. The conclusions suggested that, whilst normal ears can exist in the presence of accepted nasal pathogens, diseased ears are rarely seen in the absence of nasal sepsis. The degree of post-nasal obstruction seemed irrelevant. The commonest nasopharyngeal pathogen was Haemophilus influenzae and when found alone this had a particularly detrimental affect on middle-ear aeration, causing a significant incidence of mucoid middle-ear effusion in this group.\r"

We describe a rapid, cheap method of preparing sufficient fibrin glue, of adequate bonding power, from a small quantity of the patient's own blood, and therefore with no risk of contracting viral disease. Our method of preparation of fibrin glue promises to provide a valuable adjunct to otorhinolaryngological surgical practice.\r"

In order to optimise visual stabilisation he intuitively searched for nearby visual targets. His postural sway was recorded using posturography. His balance performance deteriorated significantly beyond a distance of 1 m between the eyes and the surrounding objects and with visual acuity below 0.3 (experimentally achieved with semitransparent plastic foils). With flicker illumination of decreasing frequencies of the visual surround he needed at least a visual input rate of 17 Hz in order to maintain an upright body position. The data provide clinical evidence for rapid visuo-spinal control of posture.\r"

The TMJ/cranium quotient depended on the age of the subject, with younger patients showing a larger quotient than older ones. Normal joints were separated from the afflicted ones by means of a discriminant analysis. Sensitivity of semiquantitative evaluation was 78% (disc displacements with reduction) and 89% (disc displacements without reduction). Correct visual evaluation was made in 53% of the reducing and 75% of the nonreducing discs. Semiquantitative SPECT of the TMJs provides important information on the extent of osseous changes in afflicted joints and is suitable for follow-up of splint therapy. It may also be helpful as a screening method in detecting clinically normal joints before arthrography is carried out and in assessing the presumptive response to treatment with a splint.\r"

Indirectly elicited twitches of the sciatic nerve-sartorius muscle were reduced at greater than or equal to 50 microM cocaine. The electrically evoked action potentials of muscle membrane were inhibited at 200 microM cocaine, in a manner consistent with a local anesthetic effect. At the synaptic region, the quantal release of transmitter from the nerve terminal was not affected by cocaine at concentrations up to 100 microM. The most potent action of cocaine was the blockade of the ion channel of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Transient membrane depolarization induced by microiontophoresis of acetylcholine was reduced to 7% of control at 50 microM cocaine in a dose-related manner; receptor desensitization was affected to a lesser extent by cocaine at all concentrations tested. The decay time constants of endplate currents were reduced at concentrations greater than or equal to 10 microM. The single channel conductances remained unchanged whereas the channel lifetimes were greatly reduced at 25 and 50 microM of the drug. Unblocking could not be discerned from the observed kinetics of either endplate current decay or single channel closed durations. However, with a combination of 10 microM cocaine and 0.4 M ethanol the endplate currents became biphasic. This suggested a blocking of open ion channels of the nicotinic receptor by cocaine followed by dissociation of acetylcholine from the blocked channel (in the absence of ethanol).\r"

Recent studies have shown that the form of the antigen recognized by T cells is generally not a native protein but rather a short peptide fragment and that class-II molecules specifically bind antigenic peptides. Furthermore, the three-dimensional structure of the human MHC class-I molecule, HLA-A2, is consistent with a peptide-binding function for MHC class-I molecules. An outstanding question concerns the molecular nature and involvement of MHC-bound peptides in antigens recognized by alloreactive T cells. In this study the effects of peptides derived from HLA-A2 on cytolysis of alloreactive cytotoxic T cells (TC) cells are presented. Peptides can inhibit lysis by binding to the T cell or sensitize to lysis by binding an HLA-A2-related class-I molecule (HLA-Aw69) on the target cell. Thus, allospecific TC cells can recognize HLA-derived peptides in the context of the MHC.\r"
