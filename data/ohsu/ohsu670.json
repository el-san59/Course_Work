  ".W": "Our purpose was to describe a technique of atrioventricular (AV) node modification for patients with drug refractory AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Nine patients (mean age, 45 +/- 20; range, 14-82) with recurrent drug refractory AVNRT (n = 8) or sudden cardiac death thought to be precipitated by AVNRT (n = 1) underwent a percutaneous catheter procedure to modify AV nodal function. The area between the electrode recording the maximal His-bundle electrogram and the ostium of the coronary sinus was divided into three zones. Perinodal direct current shocks of 100-300 J were delivered to one (n = 2), two (n = 3), or three (n = 4) zones without complications. The procedure endpoints were modification of AV conduction (either first degree AV block or complete retrograde ventriculo-atrial [VA] block) and failure to induce AVNRT before or after isoproterenol and/or atropine administration. Six of nine patients (67%) have had no inducible or spontaneous AVNRT over a mean follow-up of 12.3 +/- 4.1 months (range, 4.5-17). One of the six underwent repeat, successful modification, because AVNRT was inducible at restudy 2 days after the initial procedure. AVNRT recurred in three patients (33%), one early (3 days) and two late (3-4 months). Two of these patients underwent complete ablation of the AV junction and permanent pacemaker placement, whereas one is controlled with drug therapy. Therefore, AV nodal modification resulted in tachycardia control without antiarrhythmic drugs in six of nine (67%) and obviated the need for complete AV junctional ablation in seven of nine patients (78%). Elimination of AVNRT appears to result from either block in the retrograde fast pathway or modification of the antegrade slow pathway, such that AVNRT cannot be sustained. Additional findings suggest that an atrio-Hisian accessory connection may not be involved in AVNRT in some of these patients. Percutaneous catheter AV nodal modification appears to be a promising technique for treatment of refractory AVNRT and may obviate need for complete AV junctional ablation in a substantial number of patients with drug/pacemaker refractory AVNRT.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the central hemodynamic, leg blood flow, and metabolic responses to maximal upright bicycle exercise in 30 patients with chronic heart failure attributable to severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 24 +/- 8%) and in 12 normal subjects. At peak exercise, patients demonstrated reduced oxygen consumption (15.1 +/- 4.8 vs. 32.1 +/- 9.9 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.001), cardiac output (8.7 +/- 3.2 vs. 18.6 +/- 4.4 l/min, p less than 0.001), and mean systemic arterial blood pressure (116 +/- 15 vs. 135 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) compared with normal subjects. Leg blood flow was decreased in patients versus normal subjects at rest and matched submaximal work rates and maximal exercise (2.1 +/- 1.9 vs. 6.4 +/- 1.4 l/min, all p less than 0.01). Mean systemic arterial blood pressure was no different in the two groups at rest or at matched submaximal work rates, whereas leg vascular resistance was higher in patients compared with normal subjects at rest, submaximal, and maximal exercise (all p less than 0.01). Although nonleg blood flow was decreased at rest in patients, it did not decrease significantly during exercise in either group. Peak exercise leg blood flow was related to peak exercise cardiac output in patients (r = 0.66, p less than 0.01) and normal subjects (r = 0.67, p less than 0.01). In patients, leg vascular resistance was not related to mean arterial blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, arterial catecholamines, arterial lactate, or femoral venous pH at rest or during exercise. Compared with normal subjects during submaximal exercise, patients demonstrated increased leg oxygen extraction and lactate production accompanied by decreased leg oxygen consumption. Thus, in patients with chronic heart failure compared with normal subjects, skeletal muscle perfusion is decreased at rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise, and local vascular resistance is increased. Our data indicate that nonleg blood flow and arterial blood pressure were preferentially maintained during exercise at the expense of leg hypoperfusion in our patients. This was associated with decreased leg oxygen utilization and increased leg oxygen extraction when compared to normal subjects, providing further evidence that reduced perfusion of skeletal muscle is important in causing early anaerobic skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise in subjects with this disorder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Mean left atrial pressure decreased (from 18 +/- 8 to 11 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.00001), mean mitral diastolic pressure gradient decreased (from 12 +/- 7 to 7 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.00001), and mitral valve area increased (from 1.40 +/- 0.40 to 2.00 +/- 0.50 cm2, p less than 0.00001). Based on echocardiographic characteristics of the mitral apparatus, patients were grouped retrospectively in three categories: pliable (group 1, n = 37), semipliable (group 2, n = 59), and rigid (group 3, n = 10). Clinical success was achieved in 36 patients of group 1 (97%) and in 55 patients of group 2 (93%). Only six patients in group 3 (60%) improved symptomatically (p less than 0.001 vs. group 1, p less than 0.001 vs. group 2). The severity of mitral regurgitation increased in five patients of group 1 (14%), in 12 of group 2 (20%), and in three of group 3 (33%). Six patients had recurrent symptoms at 9 months after commissurotomy. Recurrence of symptoms was significantly more frequent in group 3 compared with the other two groups (group 1, 3%; group 2, 4%; and group 3, 50%; p less than 0.0001 vs. groups 1 and 2). Multiple regression analysis identified the previously mentioned echocardiographic characteristics of the mitral apparatus as the significant predictor for clinical outcome. Thus, percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for patients with pliable valves. Patients with semipliable or with rigid valves should be selected for operation very carefully.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to define specific types of resetting responses to programmed electrical stimulation during human ventricular tachycardia and to use computer simulations of reentry circuits to assess the possible mechanisms and pacing site location relative to the reentry circuit for each type of response. The effects of scanning single stimuli at 35 left ventricular endocardial sites during sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 12 patients were studied. In considering alterations in QRS configuration and the delay between the stimulus and the advanced QRS, we identified three types of resetting responses to scanning stimuli consistent with stimulation at sites in or near the reentry circuit at 12 abnormal endocardial sites in eight patients. Type 1: all capturing stimuli were followed after a delay by early QRS complexes that had the same configuration as the tachycardia complexes. Type 2: late stimuli reset tachycardia as in type 1 but early stimuli reset the tachycardia after altering the QRS configuration. Type 3: late stimuli reset tachycardia as in type 1, but early stimuli advanced tachycardia with a short stimulus to QRS delay without altering the QRS configuration. In the simulations, premature depolarization of sites in the circuit produced orthodromic and antidromic wavefronts. The orthodromic wavefront propagated through the circuit and exited the circuit at the same site as did the previous tachycardia wavefronts and advanced the tachycardia without altering the configuration of the advanced QRS. The antidromic wavefront of relatively late stimuli was confined within or near the circuit by collision with the orthodromic wavefront of the preceding tachycardia beat and failed to alter ventricular activation distant from the circuit. Therefore, the QRS configuration after the stimulus was unchanged. A type 1 response occurred when all capturing stimuli produced this effect. However, with increasing stimulus prematurity, the antidromic wavefront propagated farther before colliding with an orthodromic wavefront, and under some conditions, it exited the circuit from a site other than the original circuit \"exit,\" and altered the ventricular activation sequence distant from the circuit and, therefore, the QRS configuration, producing a type 2 pattern. The type 3 pattern occurred when the antidromic wavefront of early premature beats captured the original circuit exit. The effect of a stimulus was dependent on the stimulus prematurity, the relative conduction times from the stimulation site to the potential sites of \"exit\" from the circuit, and the timing of the excitable gap at the stimulation site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Angioplasty was clinically or angiographically successful in 63 patients and unsuccessful in 11. Before the procedure, 69 patients had a positive DET. Of these 69 patients, six with clinicall unsuccessful angioplasty had a dipyridamole time (i.e., the time from the onset of dipyridamole infusion to development of asynergy) lower than the 63 patients with clinically successfully angioplasty (4.2 +/- 2.9 vs. 7.0 +/- 2.9 minutes, mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01). In the five patients with angiographically unsuccessful angioplasty (residual stenosis diameter, greater than 50%), coronary stenosis decreased from 89 +/- 10 to 69 +/- 22 (p = NS); DET was positive in all five before and in four of the five after the procedure (100% vs. 80%, p = NS).

However, the functional significance of postmyocardial infarction hypertrophy is a subject of dispute. The purpose of this study was to determine the time course of development of postmyocardial infarction hypertrophy of the noninfarcted myocardium in humans and to assess its functional significance. Subcostal view, two-dimensional echocardiograms were recorded at rest and during peak exercise, 6 and 40 weeks postmyocardial infarction in 45 patients (16 anterior, 20 inferior, nine non-Q wave infarcts), for measurement of left ventricular mass and ejection fraction. The left ventricular mass index increased from 94 +/- 30 to 118 +/- 27 g/m2 (p less than 0.01) during the time of the two studies. There was a significant correlation between the change in left ventricular mass index and improved resting ejection fraction (r = 0.48, p less than 0.001) and exercise ejection fraction (r = 0.48, p less than 0.001) at the follow-up study. Of the 32 patients who increased their left ventricular mass index greater than 7%, 18 improved their rest ejection fraction greater than 0.05 units and 17 improved their exercise ejection fraction greater than 0.05 units. Conversely, of the 13 patients who failed to increase their left ventricular mass index, only three improved their rest ejection fraction and one improved the exercise ejection fraction (Fisher's exact test, p less than 0.05). We reached three conclusions. First, in humans, significant hypertrophy of the noninfarcted myocardium can be detected by two-dimensional echocardiography, 9 months postmyocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We compared BAV in 16 consecutive neonates (1985-1988) to surgical valvotomy in a prior group of 16 consecutive neonates (1978-1984). Both groups were comparable in terms of age, weight, hemodynamic data, left ventricular size, and associated lesions. There were six early and one late deaths after surgery. Five out of six neonates requiring a second operation died. Left ventricular size (measured in 13 neonates) had some influence on survival after surgery: three of three with small or hypoplastic left ventricles and three of 10 with normal-sized left ventricles died. After BAV, there were three early deaths, two patients who underwent stage I palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and two late deaths. As with surgical valvotomy, left ventricular size seemed to influence survival after BAV: five of six with small or hypoplastic left ventricles died or underwent stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome and two of nine with normal-sized left ventricles died. At follow-up (26 +/- 17 months) in six patients in the surgical group, the peak systolic ejection gradient (PSEG) was 52.2 +/- 23 mm Hg and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) 18.2 +/- 5.2 mm Hg.

Of the 571 patients with long-term follow-up, 11% required subsequent cardiovascular surgery, and 25% developed hypertension. There were 87 late deaths. The mean age at death was 38 years (range, 0-67 years). Estimated survival analysis revealed 91% of patients alive at 10, 84% at 20, and 72% at 30 years after operative repair. The most common cause of late death was coronary artery disease in 32 patients, followed by sudden death, heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, and ruptured aortic aneurysm. Age, sex, and postoperative systolic blood pressure were found to be independently predictive of survival. For patients less than 14 years of age at the time of initial coarctectomy, survival to 20 years was 91%, and for patients 14 years or older at the time of operation, survival was 79%. The best survivorship was observed in patients operated on at 9 years of age or less. The higher the postoperative systolic pressure, the higher the probability of death. This study has the largest population undergoing repair of coarctation of the aorta with a median follow-up of as long as 20 years. Four main points emerged. 1) Age at the time of initial repair is the most important predictor of long-term survival. Surgery should be offered to patients after age 1 year or sooner if hypertension is severe. 2) Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of late death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of myocardial infarction was markedly increased between 6:00 AM and 12:00 noon compared with other times of day (p less than 0.001). Myocardial infarction occurred 3.8 times more frequently between 8:00 and 9:00 AM (hour of maximum incidence) than between 12:00 midnight and 1:00 AM (hour of minimum incidence). Time of myocardial infarction based on clinical and enzymatic methods correlated well (r = 0.95). Patients with higher or lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher or lower degree of wall motion abnormalities and residual stenosis of the coronary arteries, and one-, two-, or three-vessel disease exhibited a similar circadian pattern, suggesting that the morning is a risk period for patients with mild as well as severe coronary artery disease. Only the group of patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking therapy before the event did not show an increased morning incidence of myocardial infarction. This observation may contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms by which beta-blockers reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction. Further investigation of physiologic changes occurring during the morning period of increased risk of myocardial infarction may lead to better understanding of the disorder. Design and timing of cardioprotective medication may play a crucial role in improving prevention of acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Using a combination of environmental and local cooling, we induced vasospastic attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon in nine of 11 patients with idiopathic Raynaud's disease and in eight of 10 patients with scleroderma. Attacks were defined as occurring if two of the possible three color changes (pallor, cyanosis, and rubor) occurred, and serial photographs were scored by three independent raters. Two fingers on one hand were anesthetized by local injection of lidocaine, and the effectiveness of nerve blocks was verified by plethysmography. The frequency of vasospastic attacks in nerve-blocked fingers was not significantly different from that in the corresponding intact fingers on the contralateral hand. These findings show that the vasospastic attacks of Raynaud's disease and phenomenon can occur without the involvement of efferent digital nerves and argue against the etiologic role of sympathetic hyperactivity.\r"

The present study was undertaken to define in normal human volunteers the relation between myocardial clearance kinetics of [1-11C]acetate, and the rate-pressure product as an index of myocardial oxygen consumption. Twenty-two studies were performed of 12 volunteers. The rate-pressure product was increased with continuous supine bicycle exercise in six studies. Of the 16 resting studies, seven were performed in the fasted state and nine following an oral glucose load, to define possible effects of substrate availability on the tracer-tissue kinetics. Myocardial tissue time-activity curves were biexponential. Clearance of activity was homogeneous throughout the myocardium. The rate constants k1, obtained from biexponential fitting, and kmono, obtained by monoexponential fitting of the initial linear portion of the time-activity curves, correlated well with the rate-pressure product. Although the correlation coefficient was higher for k1 than for kmono (0.95 vs. 0.91), analysis on a sectorial basis showed less regional variability in kmono. This suggests that kmono, which is more practical than k1 because it requires shorter acquisition times, may be more clinically and experimentally useful for detection of myocardial segments with abnormal oxygen consumption. Overall, changes in myocardial substrate supply were without significant effect on the relation between the rate constants (k1 and kmono) and the rate-pressure product, although a small decrease in kmono/rate-pressure product was observed following oral glucose by paired analysis in four subjects. It is concluded that [1-11C]acetate can be used for the noninvasive measurement of myocardial oxygen consumption in humans with positron emission tomography, and, thus, has clinical and experimental potential as a tool for the understanding and diagnosis of myocardial disease.\r"

Mitral leaflet billowing occurred in 28 of 28 Marfan patients with M-mode MVP versus 24 of 48 with primary MVP (p less than 0.00005), 0 of 25 Marfan patients without M-mode MVP, and 0 of 35 normal subjects (both, p less than 0.0001). Billowing occurred on the first systolic frame in 8 of 28 Marfan-MVP patients, in whom posterior leaflet chordae arose abnormally from the posterior ventricular wall, and in no other subjects. These patients had large mitral valves and normal anular dynamics, whereas the remaining 20 Marfan-MVP patients had increased systolic anular expansion. Marfan-MVP patients were younger than those without MVP (29 +/- 12 vs. 38 +/- 15 years, p less than 0.02) and had lower body mass index (19.8 +/- 2.7 vs. 23.9 +/- 2.9 kg/m2, p less than 0.00005) and systolic blood pressure (120 +/- 20 vs. 133 +/- 20 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), similar to differences between primary MVP and normal subjects in body mass index (21.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 23.9 +/- 4.8 kg/m2, p less than 0.01) and systolic pressure (118 +/- 14 vs. 125 +/- 18 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Marfan patients with and without MVP had similar arm span, arm span to height ratio, upper to lower segment ratio, and prevalence of ectopia lentis and thoracic bony abnormalities, but arachnodactyly was more frequent in those with MVP (82% and 48%, respectively; p less than 0.02). We conclude that 1) leaflet billowing occurs more uniformly in Marfan patients with MVP than in primary MVP, 2) MVP in Marfan patients may be due to either valve enlargement with distinctively abnormal chordal architecture or abnormal mitral anular distensibility, 3) Marfan patients with MVP have low body weight and systolic blood pressure, similar to primary MVP, and 4) Marfan patients with MVP more commonly have arachnodactyly but otherwise have similar skeletal and anthropometric characteristics to other Marfan patients.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of coronary flow reserve, traditionally calculated as the ratio of maximal hyperemic blood flow divided by basal flow, is difficult to interpret in serial studies because fluctuating hemodynamic parameters may affect either basal or hyperemic flow measurements. To determine the magnitude of this problem and to develop alternative approaches for measuring vascular reserve, 10 anesthetized dogs were instrumented with aortic and inferior vena cava occluders, electromagnetic coronary flow probes, and high-fidelity micromanometers in the left ventricle and aortic root. Coronary flow was measured in the basal state and during maximal hyperemia induced by a steady-state adenosine infusion. Observations were made in the absence of a stenosis and in the presence of two incremental degrees of subcritical stenosis produced by a rigid, external screw occluder. Several parameters of vascular reserve were determined: 1) coronary flow reserve (defined above), 2) mean hyperemic flow divided by mean aortic pressure, 3) mean hyperemic flow divided by the difference between mean aortic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and 4) the slope of the instantaneous relation between diastolic hyperemic flow versus pressure. Each parameter was measured during five steady-state pressure levels achieved by partial occlusion of either the inferior vena cava or the aorta and the levels ranged from 82 +/- 8 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 127 +/- 9 mm Hg during hyperemia. All measures of vascular reserve were found to be dependent on hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and mean aortic pressure. The slope of the instantaneous relation between diastolic hyperemic flow and pressure, however, showed only minimal dependence on heart rate and, in contrast to coronary flow reserve measurements, distinguished between the normal and the two stenotic states. Further, this optimal performance of the hyperemic flow versus pressure slope index was shown in a model in which coronary flow and myocardial work were not independently controlled. This index provides a sensitive and reliable indication of subcritical stenosis severity that may have clinical applications.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if catheter ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) junction with radiofrequency energy can induce chronic incomplete (first- and second-degree) AV block to avoid the need for a permanent pacemaker, 20 closed-chest dogs were studied. Group 1 (10 dogs) received radiofrequency energy (750 kHz) with a fixed power setting (5 or 10 W) while increasing the pulse duration from 10 to 50 seconds for each application. Group 2 (10 dogs) received energy with a fixed pulse duration (20 or 30 seconds) while increasing the power setting from 5 to 10 W or from 10 to 20 W during each energy delivery. Radiofrequency energy was delivered between a chest-patch electrode and the distal electrode of a regular 7F tripolar His bundle catheter. For each application, the energy delivery was interrupted when 1) the PR interval prolonged (greater than 50%) or 2) second-degree or complete AV block occurred and persisted up to 5 seconds. The ablation procedure ended when there was 1) persistent PR prolongation (greater than 50%) or persistent second-degree AV block (lasting greater than 30 minutes) after ablation, 2) occurrence of two consecutive transient (less than 1 minute) complete AV blocks after each energy delivery, or 3) complete AV block (lasting greater than 2 minutes) after ablation. Of seven dogs in group 1 and five dogs in group 2 in which incomplete AV block was achieved 1 hour after the procedure, six in group 1 and five in group 2 remained in incomplete AV block 2-3 months after ablation. One dog in group 1 progressed into complete AV block. Of the remaining three dogs in group 1 and five dogs in group 2 in which complete AV block was initially achieved 1 hour after ablation, two in group 1 and four in group 2 continued to have complete AV block, whereas one in each group had AV conduction returned to incomplete at 1-2 months of follow-up. Thus, a total of 13 dogs had chronic incomplete AV block induced by radiofrequency catheter ablation. Pathologic examination of the conduction system in two dogs with first-degree AV block, two dogs with second-degree AV block, and one dog with complete AV block showed discrete scars involving the approaches to the AV node and the AV node itself. It is concluded that, in most dogs studied, chronic incomplete AV block could be achieved by careful titration of the dosage of radiofrequency energy and by regulation of the ablation end points.\r"

Radiofrequency energy was delivered to the right ventricular endocardium between the tip of a standard 6F electrode catheter and a large W and durations of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 seconds. At necropsy 1 week later, well-demarcated homogeneous lesions were found when power had exceeded a threshold level that decreased from 1.8 W at 5 seconds to 0.7 W at 60 seconds. Lesion size ranged from 0 to 7.5 mm in depth and 0 to 9 mm in diameter. For the 5, 10, and 20 second ablations, lesion size was determined by exposure duration and power level. However, after a 20 second exposure, lesion size had reached maturity and was related to delivered power only. Therefore, a gradual, controlled growth of the lesion can be obtained by a stepwise increase of the radiofrequency power level with ample exposure duration at each level to allow for stabilization. At levels exceeding 7 W, the formation of a thin insulating layer of blood coagulum on the electrode surface caused an abrupt increase of impedance within approximately 30 seconds. Therefore, lesion size is limited to 8.5 mm in radiofrequency ablation with a standard 6F endocardial electrode catheter.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can differentiate reversible from irreversible myocardial injury, these modalities were used to study ischemia and reperfusion in a rat model. The presence of ischemia and reperfusion were confirmed with radiolabeled microspheres (n = 6). Groups of animals were subjected to either 16 (n = 17), 30 (n = 14), 60 (n = 11), or 90 (n = 14) minutes of left coronary artery (LCA) occlusion and 60 minutes reperfusion. After albumin-gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA injection, contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted, spin-echo proton images were acquired at baseline and every 16 minutes during LCA occlusion and reperfusion. In separate experiments, 31phosphorus (31P) spectra were acquired at similar time points during ischemia and reperfusion. After 16 minutes occlusion, normally perfused myocardium enhanced significantly compared with ischemic myocardium on MRI (104 +/- 7.9% vs. 61 +/- 11.0%, p less than 0.05, n = 5, mean +/- SEM, % of baseline value). MRS showed reduced phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (58.8 +/- 2.4%, p less than or equal to 0.01; 81.4 +/- 2.4, p less than or equal to 0.01, n = 12). After 16 or 30 minutes ischemia, reflow resulted in uniform MRI signal intensity of the ischemic zone compared with normal myocardium (93.5 +/- 11.3 vs. 80.9 +/- 7.0, p = NS, n = 11, % of baseline value at 30 minutes reperfusion) and PCr recovery on MRS (94.3 +/- 4.0%, p = NS, n = 20, % baseline value at 30 minutes reflow). After 60 and 90 minutes ischemia, reflow resulted in marked enhancement of reperfused compared with normal myocardium on MRI (254.0 +/- 30.0 vs. 78.3 +/- 9.2, p less than or equal to 0.01, n = 10) and no recovery of PCr on MRS (64.1 +/- 3.0, p = NS, n = 14). Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining revealed transmural myocardial infarction (MI) in all hearts subjected to 60 or 90 minutes ischemia and reflow, and small nontransmural MIs in only 2/11 hearts subjected to 16 or 30 minutes ischemia and reperfusion. Thus, 1) MRI with albumin-Gd-DTPA is useful for identifying myocardial ischemia by enhancing the contrast between normally perfused and ischemic myocardia; 2) MRI with albumin-Gd-DTPA is useful for identifying reperfusion after myocardial ischemia; and 3) after reperfusion, reversible can be distinguished from irreversible myocardial injury by characteristic findings on MRI and MRS.\r"

  ".W": "In anesthetized swine, the left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated and perfused at constant blood flow levels during two grades of ischemia. In one group (n = 10), moderate ischemia reduced percent systolic wall thickening (by sonomicrometry) from 25 +/- 7% to 6 +/- 2%, whereas in the other group (n = 7), severe ischemia reduced percent wall thickening from 24 +/- 6% to -0.5 +/- 4%. Heart rate was paced in both groups at 91 beats/min. After reperfusion and complete return to control conditions, administration of the bradycardic agent UL-FS 49 (0.37 mg/kg i.v.) decreased the heart rate to 55 +/- 5 beats/min. During subsequent ischemia at the same coronary inflow as before bradycardia, percent wall thickening in the ischemic zone during moderate ischemia was increased from 6 +/- 2% to 25 +/- 6% (p less than 0.01) (not significantly different from control without ischemia), and during severe ischemia, percent wall thickening increased from -0.5 +/- 4% to 13 +/- 7% (p less than 0.01). During moderate ischemia, bradycardia caused an increase in the subendocardial blood flow from 0.24 +/- 0.60 to 0.42 +/- 0.17 (ml/min)/g (p less than 0.009) and during severe ischemia, bradycardia caused an increase from 0.14 +/- 0.08 to 0.2 +/- 0.1 (ml/min)/g (p less than 0.001). At each level of ischemia, a more marked improvement occurred in subendocardial blood flow per beat ([(ml/min)/g]/heart rate). The relation between myocardial blood flow and wall function at a heart rate of 55 beats/min (n = 14) was plotted and compared with that studied at a heart rate of 122 beats/min in another group of pigs (n = 14). The increase in subendocardial blood flow per minute during bradycardia was not sufficient to explain the striking increase in function; thus, an independent relation (p less than 0.05) between blood flow per minute and contractile function (percent wall thickening) was found for for each heart rate. In contrast, when myocardial blood flow was normalized for heart rate and expressed per beat, data from both heart rate groups could be described by a single relation. Thus, the subendocardial blood flow per beat predicted wall function independently of heart rate and accounted for changes in both oxygen supply and demand.\r"

Although this action may promote arrhythmia suppression, apparently paradoxical arrhythmia aggravation does occur. The latter outcome is most frequently seen during treatment with the class IC agents such as encainide or flecainide, which are potent depressors of conduction even at usual plasma concentrations and heart rates. Anecdotal reports in patients with such drug toxicity have suggested a beneficial effect of sodium lactate or NaHCO3 administration. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the changes induced by sodium loading on the electrophysiologic properties of the canine ventricle pretreated with a class IC drug. Thirty dogs received loading and maintenance infusions of O-desmethyl encainide (ODE), an encainide metabolite that as a sodium channel blocker is approximately 10 times more potent than the parent drug. Interventions were administered during the maintenance phase when stable plasma ODE concentrations of 448 +/- 68 (SEM) ng/ml were present, and QRS was prolonged from 62 +/- 1 to 89 +/- 2 msec, and HV was prolonged from 28 +/- 1 to 50 +/- 1 msec. NaHCO3 (5 meq/kg during 1 minute) shortened QRS from 92 +/- 6 to 76 +/- 3 msec and shortened HV from 44 +/- 3 to 37 +/- 3 msec within 10 minutes (both p less than 0.01). NaHCO3 also significantly prolonged endocardial monophasic action potential duration from 231 +/- 22 to 272 +/- 33 msec and decreased serum [K+] from 3.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.0 +/- 0.2 meq/l, but it did not alter plasma ODE concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Monocytes/macrophages were the predominant cell type infiltrating glomeruli in IgA nephritis and HSPN. The intraglomerular monocyte population in both diseases was significantly higher than that in normals, mesangial proliferative (non-IgA) glomerulonephritis or minimal change nephrotic syndrome. In IgA nephritis, there was a clear correlation between glomerular monocyte accumulation and the degree of proteinuria. Although the monocyte influx tended to decline with time in HSPN, it remained unchanged in IgA nephritis. XFb deposition was found in the glomeruli of 27 out of 48 patients with IgA nephritis, and in 15 out of 20 with HSPN. The degree of XFb deposition in IgA nephritis correlated significantly with the degree of mesangial proliferation. These findings indicate a close relationship of monocyte/macrophage infiltration and XFb deposition with glomerular injury in IgA nephritis.\r"

Cysts which maintained a steep sodium gradient between cyst fluid and plasma (gradient cysts) exhibited conductive amiloride sensitive sodium transport. Cysts which failed to maintain a sodium gradient between cyst fluid and plasma (nongradient cysts) were insufficiently characterized. In the present study, we report flux and electrical parameters of 23 nongradient cysts studied in vitro. Nongradient cysts exhibit low PD, low Isc, and high conductance. Unidirectional fluxes of sodium and chloride varied from approximately 14.4 to greater than 250 microEq.h-1.cm-2 and net flux was not significantly different from zero. There was no apparent effect on flux or electrical parameters of amiloride, ouabain, acetazolamide, or bumetanide. There was a very high correlation between unidirectional flux of sodium and chloride in individual cysts which was similar to the predicted relationship for diffusional fluxes. This correlation suggested that movement of sodium and chloride across cyst membranes was passive via an aqueous channel. Estimates of ionic permeability exceeded those determined for proximal nephron by almost one order of magnitude. We conclude that nongradient cysts are nonfunctional and, regardless of their origin, do not function analogously to the proximal nephron.\r"

  ".W": "Camostat mesilate, a developed derivative of gabexate mesilate for oral use, was administered in a daily dose of 600 mg for 4 weeks to 17 patients with heavy proteinuria due to various nephropathies. Five patients had glomerulonephritis (3 patients with IgA nephropathy, one each with membranoproliferative GN and membranous nephropathy) and 3 had systemic vasculitis. These patients had been treated with glucocorticoid, cyclophosphamide, anticoagulants, and dipyridamole. Five patients had diabetic nephropathy and had been treated with conventional therapy including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Two cases with benign nephrosclerosis, one with Alport syndrome, and the rest with end-stage renal failure of undetermined cause were also included in this study. Urinary protein decreased promptly within 2 weeks (from 5.2 +/- 0.7 to 3.5 +/- 0.5, mean +/- SE, p less than 0.005), and serum total protein and albumin levels increased significantly. Serum creatinine levels did not change. Decreases in urinary protein excretion of more than 50% were observed in five out of eight patients with glomerulonephritis or systemic vasculitis, two out of five with diabetic nephropathy, and one with chronic renal failure. However, urinary protein excretion values remained at the same level in two patients with benign nephrosclerosis and a patient with Alport syndrome. We suggest that camostat mesilate caused a change in glomerular capillary permeability for macromolecules through its inhibitory effects on the kallikrein-kinin system, complement system, coagulation system, and platelet function, which contributed to the treatment of the various nephropathies.\r"

In ultrafiltrates from healthy subjects phenylacetylglutamine could not be detected with the methods used. Thus, it is a major nitrogenous metabolite that accumulates in uremia. A reverse phase HPLC method for the quantitative determination of phenylacetylglutamine in plasma ultrafiltrates is described.\r"

The Al concentrations in the dialysate and urine were 9.1 +/- 4.1 micrograms/l and 52.5 +/- 47.3 micrograms/l, respectively. Bone Al concentration was 21.0 +/- 14.9 ppm and correlated significantly with concentrations of Al in serum (p less than 0.01) and dialysate (p less than 0.01). A mass transfer (MT) from the patients to the dialysate was observed in all patients (-44.0 +/- 28.8 micrograms/24 h). There was a highly significant correlation between peritoneal Al MT and serum Al (p less than 0.001), actual Al consumption (p less than 0.05) and bone Al concentration (p less than 0.005) supporting the existence of an overflow phenomenon. Despite very low Al levels in the dialysate, patients are at risk of elevated Al levels in the serum, dialysate, urine and bone because of consumption of Al-containing phosphate binders.\r"

  ".W": "While formalin reprocessing of cuprophan dialyzer membranes is known to improve their biocompatibility, the effects of different re-use methods have not been systematically investigated on different membranes. Therefore, the effects of reprocessing with formalin, hypochlorite-formalin and peracetic acid were successively investigated in 3 groups of 4 patients dialyzed on cuprophan (CU), cellulose acetate (CA) or polysulfone (PS). Leukocyte count, thrombocyte count and complement activation were studied during second and third use of the dialyzer. Formalin 3% storage was found to improve leukopenia, thrombocyte count and complement activation on CU but not on PS or CA where leukocyte and thrombocyte count worsened. Hypochlorite 1% rinsing prior to formalin 3% storage abolished the improvements observed on CU with formalin and induced on CA and PS the same leukopenia as formalin. In contrast, peracetic acid storage improved leukopenia, complement activation and thrombocyte count on the 3 membranes. In addition, it was found that storage of plasma-treated membrane fragments with peracetic acid abolished neutrophil oxygen radical production. Thus it appears that re-used membranes may not be systematically assumed to be more biocompatible, this property varying with both the type of membrane and the reprocessing technique.\r"

Subsequent authors have written little about the prolonged length of postoperative rehabilitation, residual strength deficits, and the effect of the addition of a distal clavicle resection and/or rotator cuff repair. The authors reviewed 50 patients with late Neer Stage II and Stage III impingement lesions who were treated with anterior acromioplasty. In addition to the acromioplasty, 13 shoulders had a distal clavicle resection, nine had a rotator cuff repair, and ten had a distal clavicle resection and rotator cuff repair. The average patient age was 53 years (range, 36-70 years), and the average duration of symptoms was 43 months. Overall, 92% of the patients were graded as good or excellent on the basis of pain relief, strength, range of motion, and ability to resume full activity. Prolonged rehabilitation was noted in all groups, averaging 8.5 months; however, patients with a distal clavicle resection and rotator cuff repair required a 25% longer rehabilitation before full activity was obtained. A residual strength deficit was also noted in 70% of the patients requiring cuff repairs versus 50% in the patients with intact cuffs. Pain relief was equally obtained in all groups.\r"

Electromyographic studies confirmed the presence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The temperature of all the fingertips was measured. The median innervated fingertips were warmer than those innervated by the ulnar nerves. The median sympathetic fibers may be compromized by compression in the carpal tunnel. This caused vasodilation, increased finger temperature, and lack of sweating in the median innervated fingers. Due to regular exposure to water and detergents, the susceptible dry fingertips developed contact dermatitis. The patient was managed conservatively, and the rash and numbness disappeared.\r"

A clinical assessment of pain and a roentgenographic assessment of patterns of proximal femoral hypertrophy were made in 105 patients. Intraoperative evaluations of the distal stem fit were performed so that a tight distal fit was ensured in 67 patients. Thirty-eight patients who did not have intraoperative sizing were determined roentgenographically to have a loose distal fit. Pain was significantly more likely to occur in those patients with a loose distal fit (20 of 38) than in those with a tight distal fit (two of 67). Collar seating was associated with hypertrophy under the seated portion of the collar in all cases, and failure to seat the collar was associated with recession and rounding of the upper femoral cortical edge. Distal hypertrophy occurred in 24 of the 67 hips with a tight distal fit, and a tight distal fit did not prevent proximal hypertrophy. It was concluded that a tight distal fit is associated with more complete pain relief in cementless total hip arthroplasty and that a tight distal fit of a cylindrical stem does not prevent proximal load bearing.\r"

Postoperative flexion depended partly on preoperative flexion and partly on the prosthesis used, but these factors could not be the only determinants of results, for flexion in individual knees could increase, decrease, or remain unchanged whatever the preoperative measurement and whatever the design of prosthesis. Little difference in flexion before or after TKA was found between rheumatoid and osteoarthritic knees. Success or failure of the implant, according to the crude definition used, was not associated with degree of flexion. Patients with the lowest levels of function tended to have TKA with the least flexion and vice versa. Nevertheless, the degree of flexion is only one of the factors influencing mobility.\r"

  ".W": "Recent years have seen the introduction of a great many knee orthosis designs prescribed for protection against ligamentous injury or reinjury of the knee. The configurations and materials incorporated in these designs vary greatly, but all claim to be very effective. A leg model and 11 different commercially available knee orthoses were tested with static loading to obtain objective data on the relative effectiveness of the 11 designs to protect the knee from externally applied valgus moments. From these data, the effectiveness of each orthosis was calculated in terms of the rigidity contributed to the leg/orthosis combination. At a static valgus loading of 78 Nm, there was an eightfold variation in the rigidities contributed by the various knee orthoses, ranging from a low of 0.9 Nm per degree valgus to a maximum of 7.2 Nm per degree. The authors related analyses of two aspects of knee orthosis design (orthosis length and orthosis rigidity) to effectiveness in protecting against knee valgus overload injuries. Correlations were found between design inadequacies noted theoretically and efficacy problems evident from the laboratory tests. Orthosis length and orthosis rigidity must both be adequate, or the orthosis will not be biomechanically effective.\r"

The medial:lateral stiffness ratio calculated for the normal plateaus was significantly different from the ratios computed for specimens with medial compartment OA and lateral compartment OA; however, the ratio was unchanged in tricompartment OA.

All cases met strict histologic criteria for diagnosis. Four cases were localized PVS (LPVS), and 25 cases were diffuse PVS (DPVS). Roentgenographic findings were largely in the soft tissues. Cystic invasion of bone or degenerative changes were rare, although present in some cases. When present in DPVS, these changes were most pronounced in the patellofemoral articular surface. In the cases of DPVS, large posterior tumefactions did not correlate with extraarticular extension. Clinical behavior of PVS was governed more by anatomic site and form of disease than by the severity of histologic or roentgenographic findings.\r"

The relationships between the pull-out forces and the properties of the material into which they were inserted were also examined. For the same depth of insertion, the pull-out force of a 6.5-mm diameter screw was two times larger than that of a 3.8-mm diameter screw. Despite its smaller diameter, a 6.5-mm diameter screw demonstrated a pull-out force 13.6% greater than that of an optimally press-fitted 10-mm diameter round peg when both were inserted to the same depth; however, optimal compression for the peg was strongly dependent upon the size of predrilling and the modulus of elasticity of the material into which the peg was inserted. The pull-out force of a cancellous screw has a linear relationship with the shear strength of the material into which it is inserted. The pull-out force of a peg exhibits a linear relationship with the modulus of elasticity of the material into which it is inserted.\r"

  ".W": "A newly developed instrumented knee laxity tester was used to measure anteroposterior (AP) drawer parameters (Lachmann test) in populations of normal subjects and patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) insufficiencies. The AP drawer tester features a differential electronic measuring procedure of displacements between patella and tuberosity over a continuous range between 180 and -180 N of AP forces. In the statistical evaluation, shift and compliance (or stiffness) parameters at various forces are considered. In a representative normal population, all relevant parameters were established, thus creating a normal data base for future reference. The average normal AP drawer shift between maximal anterior and posterior forces (180 N) was 6.4 +/- 1.7 mm. Right-left differences and male-female differences were found not to be statistically significant in any of the parameters. The validity of the instrumented drawer tester was confirmed relative to a group of patients with acute documented ligament insufficiencies. Measurements in two groups of patients with chronic postoperative knee instabilities revealed that although the diagnosis of instability could be confirmed, the results could hardly discriminate between ACL and PCL insufficiencies, probably due to unrecognized associated lesions at the time of operation and/or gradual postoperative developments of insufficiencies and deformities. An unexpected finding was that the mean laxities of the uninjured contralateral knees were significantly extended relative to the normal reference group, suggesting that these patients could have been classified as a high-risk group even before the time of injury.\r"

In most of the cases they involve the acetabular area, as was the case in nine of 14 cases of osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma presented in this study. Especially with small tumors, such as osteoid osteomas, such a rare occurrence together with difficulties in the interpretation of roentgenograms can lead to mistakes and delays in diagnosis. To reduce these risks, a high grade of clinical suspicion and the use of tomograms or computed tomography (CT) scan and isotope bone scan are required. CT scan is an invaluable tool also for planning the surgical treatment in cases in which the tumor involves the acetabulum. Whereas an intracapsular excision is an adequate treatment for pelvic osteoid osteoma, pelvic osteoblastoma due to its size may need more aggressive surgery, even leading in some cases to a partial pelvic resection. The risk of recurrence is higher for osteoblastoma than for osteoid osteoma, as well as the rate of complications.\r"

Concentrations of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3, 1 alpha(OH)D3, and dexamethasone at which they exerted 50% reduction of the total area of TA 102 colony formation were 9 X 10(-9) M, 9 X 10(-8) M, and 5 X 10(-6) M, respectively. Effects of anticancer drugs on TA 102 cells were also investigated and concentrations needed for 50% growth inhibition (50% inhibitory concentration values) of cis-platinum, mitomycin C (MMC), methotrexate (MTX), and Adriamycin (ADR) against TA 102 cells were calculated to be 0.07 microgram/ml, 0.0008 microgram/ml, 0.0008 microgram/ml, and 0.0005 microgram/ml, respectively.

  ".W": "In 20 sheep, aged seven to eight months, a tibial lengthening osteotomy was performed to compare the process of repair of the metaphyseal and diaphyseal regions of the bone. Analogous to clinical lengthening, two frame configurations of a bilateral external fixation device were used to obtain adequate fixation of the bone segments in the metaphyseal and diaphyseal lengthening osteotomies. A daily distraction rate of 1 mm for 4.5 weeks yielded an average length increase of 2.6 cm (12.5%). After death at 4.5 weeks postdistraction, the elongated bones were tested mechanically with the contralateral tibiae as controls. No significant difference in relative torsional strength of the elongated tibiae was found between the two groups. Inferior mechanical stability of the bone segments in metaphyseal compared with diaphyseal lengthening (due to differences in frame rigidity and distribution of muscular moments) influenced healing to such an extent that any superior biologic, osteogenic potential in the metaphyseal bone region was nullified. With the clinical use of two configurations of a given external device necessary for fixation of the bone segments in a metaphyseal or diaphyseal lengthening osteotomy, the empirically accepted idea that metaphyseal healing is superior may not be correct.\r"

Over one third (39%) of mothers studied reported their first positive feeling during the prenatal period, 42 percent during birthing or the first day and 19 percent on the second or third day. A majority of mothers (70%) described their strong positive feelings toward their newborns (i.e., \"love\") as a sense of caring, commitment and concern. Several demographic, biological and environmental factors were associated with the development of first positive feelings in primiparous mothers. One half of mothers who planned to become pregnant developed positive feelings prenatally, while 57 percent of mothers who did not plan to become pregnant reported their first positive feelings during birth or the first day. Delay in first positive feelings until after the first day was associated with labor longer than 8 hours, disappointment with the \"bonding\" experience, breast-feeding, and high depressive symptoms.\r"

Borderline values were defined as total cholesterol between 200 and 240 mg/dl and LDL cholesterol between 130 and 160 mg/dl. Abnormal values were found in 32/61 (52%) and borderline values were found in 12/61 (20%) parents. Of the abnormal parents, 13/32 (41%) had unrecognized or known but untreated hyperlipidemia, and 9/12 (75%) of the borderline parents had unrecognized abnormalities.

  ".W": "Theophylline disposition was examined in seven passive smokers, defined as nonsmokers with long-term exposure to cigarette smoke, and seven age-matched nonsmokers with minimal smoke exposure. Subjects were given an intravenous infusion of aminophylline (6 mg/kg) and blood samples were drawn before and during the 48-hour postinfusion period. Clearance for passive smokers was 6.01 x 10(-2) L/hr.kg and for nonsmokers, clearance was 4.09 x 10(-2) L/hr.kg (p less than 0.025). Terminal elimination half-life for passive smokers was 6.93 hours versus 8.69 hours for nonsmokers (p less than 0.05). The mean residence time for passive smokers was 9.89 hours. For nonsmokers, the mean residence time was 13.11 hours (p less than 0.05). These measurements were statistically different, whereas there was no difference in volume of distribution between the groups, suggesting that passive smokers metabolize theophylline more rapidly than nonsmokers. Plasma and urine cotinine and nicotine concentrations were measured in all subjects. There was a significant difference between the subject groups in plasma (p less than 0.004) and urine (p less than 0.002) cotinine concentrations. Theophylline clearance correlated with both plasma (r = 0.73, p less than 0.01) and urine (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01) cotinine concentrations. Additional studies should be conducted to further define the pharmacokinetic characteristics of passive smokers and to assess the effects of passive smoking on drugs metabolized by the mixed function oxidase system.\r"

  ".W": "A potential complicating factor in the characterization of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diltiazem after an oral dose in the presence of two metabolites, N-demethyldiltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem, in plasma. Both N-demethyldiltiazem and desacetylditiazem have been shown to have pharmacologic activity in animal tissues. It is therefore possible that these metabolites contribute to the pharmacologic effect of diltiazem, but this possibility has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diltiazem, N-demethyldiltiazem, and desacetyldiltiazem. Particular attention was paid to the effect of diltiazem on atrioventricular conduction. Six healthy men received a 120 mg oral dose of diltiazem. Concentrations of diltiazem, N-demethyldiltiazem, and desacetyldiltiazem in plasma and urine were measured by a sensitive HPLC method. Measures of pharmacologic response (heart rate, blood pressure, and PR interval) were obtained at each blood sampling time. Mean (+/- SD) peak plasma concentrations of diltiazem, N-demethyldiltiazem, and desacetyldiltiazem were 174.3 +/- 72.7, 42.6 +/- 10.0, and 14.9 +/- 3.3 ng/ml, respectively. The apparent half-lives of diltiazem, N-demethyldiltiazem, and desacetyldiltiazem were 6.5 +/- 1.4 hours, 9.4 +/- 2.2 hours, and 18 +/- 6.2 hours, respectively. Both N-demethyldiltiazem and diltiazem were eliminated by net secretion, whereas the renal clearance of desacetyldiltiazem did not exceed clearance by filtration. Both N-demethyldiltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem are bound to plasma proteins, with unbound fractions of 0.323 +/- 0.035 and 0.230 +/- 0.021. These values are similar to the unbound fraction of diltiazem (0.254 +/- 0.027). No significant effect of diltiazem on blood pressure or heart rate was noted. However, a prolongation of the PR interval was observed in all six subjects. Furthermore, an apparent clockwise hysteresis in the concentration-effect relationship was found in four of the six subjects. These findings suggest that some form of acute tolerance to the electrophysiologic effect of diltiazem develops, but the results of pharmacodynamic modeling suggest that this is not caused by the antagonistic effects the metabolites.\r"

The addition of enoxacin (400 mg, twice daily) to a theophylline dosing regimen (150 mg, twice daily) resulted in an immediate fall in plasma theophylline metabolite concentrations. Mean steady-state theophylline concentration in plasma during the dosing interval increased from 3.17 to 8.23 micrograms/ml. The mean 12-hour recovery of total theophylline metabolite decrease from 76.3 to 38.6 mg. After the discontinuation of enoxacin, but not theophylline, the plasma theophylline metabolite levels immediately increased to near or above the concentrations observed before enoxacin coadministration. Concurrently, theophylline concentrations decreased to levels equivalent to those observed before enoxacin coadministration. In general, the changes in plasma theophylline concentrations observed after the addition of discontinuation of enoxacin were complete within 3 days.\r"

Mixed MNL cells were sequentially incubated with monoclonal antibodies specific for certain MNL subsets. Sheep antimouse antibodies coupled to magnetic beads were then added, and the desired MNL subset was pulled out with a magnet. This method yielded subsets with high purity and did not alter beta-receptor density or function. Healthy volunteers were treated for 7 days with the beta 2-selective agonist terbutaline (5 mg t.i.d.). Terbutaline treatment decreased beta-receptor number and isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation in natural killer cells, helper T cells, and suppressor/cytotoxic T cells but not in B cells. The decrease was greatest in suppressor/cytotoxic T cells and least in helper T cells. Thus beta-adrenergic receptor regulation by agonists appears to differ among MNL subsets.\r"

Twelve middle-aged black women with essential hypertension, controlled with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day, randomly received 3200 mg ibuprofen and a placebo for 8 days. Each treatment phase was separated by a 1-week washout period. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), body weight, and 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium, creatinine, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were determined at the end of each treatment phase. Mean (+/- SEM) 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 122/85 (+/- 2.9/1.7) and 125/85 (+/- 3.0/1.1) during the placebo and ibuprofen phases, respectively. Mean ABPM during six consecutive 4-hour periods also revealed no significant differences between placebo and ibuprofen. We conclude that 3200 mg ibuprofen per day for up to 1 week induced little change in blood pressure in hypertensive who are receiving hydrochlorothiazide.\r"

Two additional serum samples were obtained for other aspects to the study. A timed urine collection was also obtained. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were determined by comodeling the serum and urine data with a three-compartment open model (parameterized as microconstants) with a bayesian algorithm and by noncompartmental analysis. Bayesian-derived parameter estimates were total body clearance of drug from plasma, 29.8 L/hr/1.73 m2; renal clearance, 17.0 L/hr/1.73 m2; and nonrenal clearance, 12.7 L/hr/1.73 m2 and were not significantly different from noncompartmentally derived parameters (p = 0.80, p = 0.65 and p = 0.333, respectively). The study demonstrates the use of optimal sampling theory to determine an informative yet relatively sparse sampling strategy for a drug with a complex pharmacokinetic model.\r"

Repeated doses were given on request for the 24-hour study period. There was a weak but significant nonlinear correlation between length of effective analgesia and the cumulative dose of the drug (r = 0.26, p less than 0.001). In 12 of 22 patients, the maximal length of effective analgesia was reached before the last dose and the effect tended to taper off thereafter. The mean maximal length of effective analgesia was 4.69 +/- 0.32 hours (mean +/- SEM), whereas the length of effective analgesia with the last dose was only 3.34 +/- 0.46 hours (p less than 0.0005). There was a significant correlation between the peak serum concentrations of sufentanil during the dose interval and the length of effective analgesia (r = 0.44, p less than 0.0001). Area under the concentration-time curve was proportional to the size of the epidural dose, and with all three doses tested there was a gradual accumulation of sufentanil in the serum. Mean time-to-peak concentration (tmax) increased with repeated doses (p less than 0.05). Mean serum concentration of sufentanil during periods of slow respiratory rate (0.47 +/- 0.05 ng/ml) was significantly higher than during episodes without adverse respiratory effects (0.37 +/- 0.05 ng/ml, p less than 0.05). The above data suggest that an important part of the analgesic and adverse effects of sufentanil are mediated centrally, after this opioid is absorbed systemically.\r"

The oral morphine dose was administered in a total volume of 200 ml to patients either immediately after food intake or while in the fasting state. There was a 34% increase in the area under the curve (AUC) when morphine was administered immediately after food when compared with the fasting state (p less than 0.02). However, there was no significant difference between the maximum blood morphine concentration (Cmax) or the time to maximum concentration (tmax) between the two treatment regimens. The shape of the blood morphine concentration-time curve was consistently altered in the fed patients compared with patients who were in the fasting state, inasmuch as the blood morphine concentrations were maintained at a higher level from 240 to 600 minutes after the dose when the morphine was administered with food (p less than 0.02). It is suggested that morphine concentrations are maintained at higher levels, possibly resulting in more prolonged pain relief, when morphine is administered with food compared with the same dose administered to patients who are in the fasting state.\r"

The immediate effects of orally administered verapamil (120 mg) and propranolol (80 mg), alone and combined, on submaximal exercise hemodynamics and on pharmacokinetics were studied in eight healthy male volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner. Maximum effects on heart rate, systolic blood pressure, PR interval and rate-adjusted PR prolongation were greatest with the combined administration of verapamil and propranolol. The combination caused a high frequency of adverse drug events, predominantly exercise fatigue. Verapamil increased the AUC and Cmax and shortened the tmax of propranolol. Propranolol decreased the AUC and Cmax of verapamil. The greater reduction of heart rate with the combination of verapamil and propranolol was only partially explained by higher plasma concentrations of propranolol. The combination of propranolol and verapamil produced clinically important synergistic adverse effects during exercise. Negative dromotropic effects occurred primarily by direct AV node inhibition and were more important than previously recognized.\r"

  ".W": "Hexylene glycol (HG), which has been used for years in industrial chemicals and cosmetics, has recently been introduced in topical corticosteroids. We studied the irritant and sensitizing properties of HG in eczema patients. HG at 50% or 30% and propylene glycol (PG) at 30% in water were patch tested in 823 eczema patients subjected to routine patch testing. Oedema and erythema reactions from HG occurred in 2.8% of the patients. The corresponding result for PG was 3.8%. 50% HG equalled 30% PG in producing a visible reaction. In patch tests with dilution series, 2 patients reacted to 1% HG, but in both cases ROAT with HG remained negative. One other patient with a 3+ patch test reaction to both 30% PG and 50% HG had a positive ROAT result to 30% HG in water and to 5% PG in a cream base. PG, but not HG, increased transepidermal water loss both in atopic normal-looking skin and among healthy controls. The present results suggest that HG is less irritating that PG under occlusion, but that delayed contact allergic reactions may occur.\r"

To test whether H-17-B could be used for detecting topical corticosteroid allergy, we screened patients undergoing routine patch testing with H-17-B. Patients with clearly allergic or doubtful/mildly irritant patch test reactions to H-17-B, and with a history suggesting topical corticosteroid allergy, were further tested with a large panel of steroid preparations. 20 out of 4039 patients (0.5%) showed definite allergic test reactions to corticosteroids. A further 165 patients with clinically suspected corticosteroid allergy were directly tested with a panel of steroid preparations; 14 patients showed positive patch test reactions. Altogether, 33 out of 34 patients with corticosteroid allergy had positive test reactions to H-17-B. Inclusion of 1.0% H-17-B in ethanol in the standard patch test series improves the diagnosis of topical corticosteroid hypersensitivity.\r"

Cooling of the skin to less than 20 degrees C, by application of an ice cube for 30 min on the inside of the forearm, abolished itch and reduced erythema by approximately 50%, whereas the size of the wheal was unaffected by cooling. The observations bear significance for an explanation of the well-known observation that cold relieves itch. A normal itch response seems to require a continuous metabolic process in the skin, which is inhibited at temperatures less than 20 degrees C. The skin symptoms, itching and erythema, among workers in the fish processing industry are mainly localized to the forearms and backs of the hands, but only seldom to the fingers and palms, although they are in direct contact with fish products. Skin temperature measurements have shown that the temperature on the fingers and palms is less than 20 degrees C, while the temperature on the backs of the hands and forearms ranges from 25 to 30 degrees C. We therefore conclude that the skin temperature is an important factor for the location of skin symptoms among workers in the fish processing industry.\r"

A significant difference in the skin response to the 2 qualities was found both clinically and by non-invasive methods used for quantitation. 5 different qualities of SLS were investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Marked discrepancies in the quantity of C12 carbon chains in the products were found, offering an explanation for the proven difference in the clinical response. It is concluded that only SLS qualities of high purity should be used for irritant patch testing, and that both the quality and the purity of SLS should be stated.\r"

PB transdermal formulations were developed since this route has the potential to provide a more constant, prolonged and therapeutically-effective drug level in the body. Guinea pig skin sensitization studies, using a variation of the split adjuvant technique, were conducted with various PB transdermal formulations as part of a safety evaluation profile. 3 gel matrix formulations were tested. The 3 formulations contained 50% PB, 30% PB with 0.198% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and 30% PB with 0.21% of a proprietary surfactant (PS), respectively. SLS and the proprietary surfactant were added to the formulations as dermal penetration enhancers. 9 groups of 10 animals were induced and challenged with 1 of the 3 PB or PB/surfactant formulations (3 groups per formulation). In addition, 2 groups of 10 animals were included in the study as positive controls that were induced and challenged with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). 44% of the animals responded positively at challenge to 50% PB. 80% of the animals responded positively at challenge to 30% PB/0.198% SLS and 82% of the animals had positive responses at challenge to 30% PB/0.21% PS. This study demonstrates that PB is a potential contact sensitizer that shows a potentiated response in the presence of surfactants.\r"

The daily ultrafiltrate losses of amino acids were also greater, 4.2 +/- 0.7 mmol/24 h (1.1 g N) compared to 2.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/24 h (0.6 g N, p less than .05). For all patients there was a positive correlation between the serum amino acid value and ultrafiltrate loss (r = .84, p less than .001).

No changes in the total number of splenocytes or of splenic B cells were found after hemorrhage. Decreases of greater than 40% in the total number of Ig-producing cells as well as in the numbers of B cells secreting IgM, IgA, and IgG2b were found during the period of 2 to 96 h posthemorrhage. Subsequent increases in the numbers of cells secreting IgA, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3 were present 96 to 144 h after hemorrhage. Total serum Ig levels fell by approximately 40% 3 days after hemorrhage, and then returned to normal within 5 days posthemorrhage.

Unanesthetized sheep with a 15% total body surface (TBS) third-degree burn were resuscitated back to baseline VO2 and vascular pressures. DO2 was adjusted further by infusion and removal of whole blood. The response was compared to the same maneuver in nonburned sheep. We found that increasing DO2 after burns resulted in a 32% increase in VO2, while the same maneuver in controls produced no change in VO2. We then determined whether the increase in VO2, caused by volume loading, resulted in a further increase in postburn oxidant release and lipid peroxidation measured as conjugated dienes. Plasma conjugated dienes increased significantly and equally by 30% in burns maintained at baseline VO2 vs. the increased VO2. Therefore, the increased oxygen used is not simply resulting in further oxidant damage. VO2 was maintained equally in both burned animals and controls with a decrease in DO2 by increased oxygen extraction from Hgb. We conclude that standard burn resuscitation does not restore adequate DO2 for oxygen demands. The 30% increase in VO2 achieved by increasing DO2 does not lead to a further release of oxidants from burn tissue and is therefore potentially beneficial for cell function.\r"

The amount of fluid infused was equal to the amount of blood withdrawn in the plasma substitute groups, but was increased four-fold in the RA group. Five nonbled pigs served as controls. No statistically significant changes occurred within the control group in any of the variables measured. One animal died of hypovolemic shock 3 h after RA administration. Bleeding and fluid infusion caused a 41% and 44% reduction in Hgb in the HES and DEX groups, respectively, while RA caused only a 25% reduction. A prompt increase in cardiac output was detected in animals receiving colloids (52% with HES), and cardiac output was maintained above initial values during the entire 5-h follow-up period. In the RA group, no increase in cardiac output occurred during fluid administration; during the follow-up period, cardiac output decreased consistently. Similarly, stroke volume and arterial pressures were best maintained with HES, but decreased after RA. Oxygen consumption and delivery were highest after HES and lowest in the RA group, where arteriovenous oxygen difference increased throughout the study. We conclude that both colloid solutions were superior to RA, which did not prevent hypovolemia or maintain adequate oxygen transport.\r"

Test volume (0.25 vs. 0.4 ml) and agitation speed (2 shakes/sec vs. one shake/sec) resulted in significantly different ACT values (p less than .05). The mean matched ACT values determined from different agitation directions (vertical vs. horizontal) or the use of a stepper pipette to measure test volume vs. visual estimation of test volume were not significantly different. Variability in ACT test results is significantly increased by variations in test volume or agitation (speed and direction), intermachine variability, and by interpersonnel technique. These variables should be considered when devising protocols for ACT monitoring and management of heparin therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid method of definitive low tracheostomy utilizing an original instrument kit and percutaneous approach is described. Through a horizontal, shallow (1.5-cm) skin incision in the neck, a 12-ga needle is introduced into the tracheal lumen. A flexible metal guidewire is gently introduced through the needle, which is then removed. A specially designed percutaneous tracheostomy tool slides over the guidewire into the trachea; by squeezing its handles, the intercartilaginous space is enlarged, securing the placement of a cuffed tracheal cannula. After extensive and successful investigation in both cadaver and animal trials, the procedure was carried out in 80 patients who had a variety of underlying diseases, without serious complications. Of these 80 patients, 33 required airway control after neurosurgical interventions or after severe head trauma, 23 had percutaneous tracheostomy performed before radical excision for head and neck cancer, and the remaining 24 suffered from severe cardiorespiratory problems. Twenty-nine procedures were performed in the operating theater, and 51 procedures were carried out at the patient's bedside in the ICU, ED, or in the ward. There was no infection at the stoma site, and late healing was remarkable. It should be strongly emphasized that in the majority of our patients the procedure was carried out safely at the bedside. This resolved the logistic problem of moving very sick ICU patients (who are sometimes on high PEEP levels) to the OR. Although our experience is totally restricted to elective situations, we do postulate that it could be as effective in a variety of urgent situations.\r"

Immediate thoracotomy in the ED is associated with good resuscitative results in a select group of such patients, but cardiorrhaphy is often impeded by frequent inflations of the left lung during resuscitation. We investigated a technique for selective right-lung ventilation using a standard single-lumen endotracheal tube in cadaver and animal models. This technique is easily applicable, provides adequate oxygenation and ventilation for up to 60 min, and expedites cardiorrhaphy in the ED.\r"

To obtain the best chance of survival and recovery, there must be optimal coordination among all rescuers. This objective was approached by adopting a formal protocol designed for each city. In France, the medical organization for the treatment of casualties is operated by anesthesiologists who are qualified to perform ALS, preanesthetic evaluation en route, anesthesia for the multitrauma patient, and postanesthetic resuscitation in a continuum from the accident scene to the ICU.\r"

Of all patients, 47% had felt anxiety and/or fear during the treatment. These feelings were intimately related to the experience of agony/panic (p less than .001) and insecurity (p less than .001). Inability to talk and communicate was found to be the dominating reason (p less than .001) for evoking such feelings and also made it difficult for the patients to sleep and rest (p less than .05); no correlation to pain was found. Difficulties to synchronize with the respirator in connection with suctioning also caused feelings of anxiety/fear (p less than .01), agony/panic (p less than .01), and insecurity (p less than .001). Even as long as 4 yr after respirator treatment, most patients (90%) who remember the treatment still recall the situation as unpleasant and stress-evoking. The isolation due to communication difficulties was a greater problem than direct airway-related nursing care activities. This relationship between communication difficulties and severe emotional reactions should be considered in the nursing care of respirator-treated patients.\r"

Cumulative survival rate analysis revealed a linear decrease in the number of complication-free catheters with time. The median duration of complication-free catheter survival was projected to be 23.3 days. The risk of catheter complication did not increase with increasing daily duration of catheter use as demonstrated by probability density function: catheter complication rates were similar on the first day after insertion (1.06 +/- 0.5%), the seventh day (4.27 +/- 1.6%), and the 24th day (2.48 +/- 2.4%). Therefore, in this population, routine catheter replacement would not be expected to lower the incidence of catheter-related complications, but may unnecessarily increase the number of insertion-related complications.\r"

We examined their serum creatinine level (SCr), daily urine flow (UF), 24-h creatinine clearance (Ccr), and hemodynamic indices before and during NE infusion. Before NE administration, the patients were divided into those with with a serum lactate level (Lac) less than 20 mg/dl (group A, n = 9) and greater than 20 mg/dl (group B, n = 6). NE was infused continuously at rates between 0.05 and 0.24 microgram/kg.min which increased systolic BP by greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg. Cardiac index was not significantly changed in either group. In group A, NE increased both UF (p less than .05), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (p less than .01), but did not affect Ccr. In group B, NE did not increase UF nor SVRI, and decreased Ccr significantly (p less than .05). It is concluded that NE increased UF and SVRI only when Lac was in normal range; otherwise, NE reduced renal function. Thus, when administering NE to increase UF, both Lac and renal function should be monitored carefully.\r"

P at H0 was in or above the normal range in ten patients and below normal range in four patients. P decreased significantly (p less than .001) after MV at H1, H4, H7, H12, and H24. Hypophosphatemia was present in all patients after MV, but was severe (p less than .3 mmol/L) in only two patients. There was a significant correlation (r = .56 p less than .01) between the decrease of P and the increase of pH after MV. Hypophosphatemia was a constant and early finding after institution of MV in COPD patients and was presumably related to an intracellular shift of P secondary to the correction of respiratory acidosis.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the respiratory index (RI = alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient [P(A-a)O2] normalized by PaO2) and the pulmonary shunt (Qsp/Qt) has been examined in 929 studies from 240 critically ill post-traumatic patients. Of these, 88 patients (443 studies) were individuals who developed post-traumatic adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 152 were patients (486 studies) who did not develop ARDS. This study demonstrates that the RI to Qsp/Qt [RI/(Qsp/Qt)] relationship was significantly (p less than .0001) increased in patients who developed fatal ARDS compared with those who did not develop ARDS, or with those whose ARDS resolved. Because of the increased oxygen consumption (VO2) in ARDS patients in association with their severe limitations in gas exchange (RI) and increased Qsp/Qt, surviving ARDS patients had a significant increase in the cardiac index which resulted in a higher oxygen delivery to VO2 ratio. ARDS patients showed significant (p less than .0001) evidence of increased pulmonary vascular tone, correlated with the increase in the RI/(Qsp/Qt) relationship. In addition, those patients with high RI/(Qsp/Qt) also had increased right ventricular (RVSW) to left ventricular work (LVSW) ratios which were shown to be a direct function of the rise in RI. This increase in both RVSW/LVSW and RI/(Qsp/Qt) ratios was significantly (p less than .0001) correlated with an increased mortality. Thus, the RI/(Qsp/Qt) relationship, which can be obtained from arterial and mixed venous blood gases and saturations only, can be used to predict the severity of the ARDS process as well as important pulmonary vascular and right ventricular overload consequences.\r"

  ".W": "We studied ICU patient blood loss as a result of diagnostic testing (DBL) and the effect of two measures to reduce it. A policy of using small volumes (pediatric phlebotomy tubes, reduced syringe volumes) for the most frequent laboratory tests was implemented in our medical ICU. We prospectively studied 151 patients admitted during two consecutive 10-wk periods. During period 2, DBL was displayed on each ICU flow sheet. The DBL/day (43.6 +/- 3 [SEM] ml) was significantly lower (62.6 +/- 4 ml) than it would have been if standard volume tubes had been used. This represented an average savings of 33%. During period 1 (n = 81), eight (10%) patients with no diagnosis involving blood loss had a decrease in Hct and received transfusion. DBL was significantly higher (316 +/- 81 vs. 168 +/- 18 ml, p less than .001) for these patients and represented an average of 17% of transfusion requirements. During period 2 (n = 70), such transfusion requirements were significantly reduced (only one of 70, p less than .001), as were tests ordered/day (7.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.5 +/- 0.6, p less than .05). We conclude that DBL is a major health problem for the ICU patient. Routine use of small specimen volumes in this setting is warranted. Recording DBL for use in physician decision-making also significantly impacts this problem and should be considered an important part of the ICU database.\r"

The cardiovascular responses of seven normals and ten critically ill patients to 45 degrees head-up tilt with the legs horizontal (0 degrees) were analyzed. Stroke volume index (SI) and cardiac index (CI) were measured with thoracic electric bioimpedance (TEB). The baseline TEB (Z0) was measured to monitor fluid shift out of the thorax during tilt. BP was measured and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) was calculated. Normals responded to the modified head-up tilt with a decreased SI (59 to 44 ml/m2 and CI (3.7 to 2.8 L/min.m2), and an increased SVRI and Z0 (25.5 to 27.9). As a group, the patients showed no significant change with tilt. However, individual analysis revealed a heterogeneous response by the patients. Those patients who demonstrated a caudal shift of blood (increased Z0) had decreased SI. Those with no indication of a caudal shift of blood, presumably due to decreased venous compliance, did not change SI. Thus, this type of modified head-up tilt can be used in the ICU to study more intensely cardiovascular function and control in the bedridden subject.\r"

This elevation was sustained only in five who previously showed some response to the slower infusion. HR was unaffected except for an increase of 22 +/- 12 beat/min (p less than .01) in the five showing sustained MAP elevation with 10 micrograms/kg.min. Dobutamine failed to raise MAP in the seven who relapsed, and refractory shock resulted. We conclude that time should not be wasted when starting dopamine at less than 10 micrograms/kg.min in hypotensive preterm infants, as lower rates are unlikely to produce a response and delay may cause further compromise.\r"

Six animals received colloid only while six received colloid and bicarbonate. Both groups recovered rapidly hemodynamically, but conjunctival, subcutaneous, and liver tissue PO2 values returned to baseline more slowly after bicarbonate administration. In the NaHCO3 group, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and arterial bicarbonate concentration were higher during early resuscitation, and arterial plasma lactate remained higher than in the control group at the end of the follow-up period. The delayed increase in tissue PO2 values after bicarbonate infusion may be explained, at least partly, by decreased arterial blood oxygenation and a shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve to the left. NaHCO3 adjunct has no added beneficial effect on hemodynamics and may be harmful to tissue oxygenation in hemorrhagic shock resuscitated with hetastarch.\r"

  ".W": "Direct mechanical ventricular assistance (DMVA) is a method of biventricular circulatory support that employs a pneumatic device to apply both systolic and diastolic forces directly to the ventricular myocardium. This study investigated the effects of DMVA on myocardial hemodynamics when applied after a prolonged cardiopulmonary arrest. Seven swine weighting 28.3 +/- 2.5 kg were instrumented for regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) measurements using tracer microspheres. Ventricular fibrillation was then induced. After 10 min of ventricular fibrillation, CPR was initiated for 3 min. DMVA was then applied through median sternotomy. Defibrillation was attempted after 3.5 min of DMVA. If unsuccessful, DMVA was instituted for another 17.5 min and a subsequent defibrillation attempt was made. Arterial oxygen content (CaO2), coronary sinus oxygen content (CcSO2), myocardial oxygen delivery/consumption (mDO2/mVO2), extraction ratio (ER), and endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratio (EN/EP) were determined during CPR, during the initial application of DMVA (DMVA1), and after the subsequent 17.5 min of DMVA in those animals not initially defibrillated (DMVA2). Three of the seven animals were successfully defibrillated during DMVA1. After the additional 17.5 min of DMVA, only one other animal was defibrillated. There was a significant improvement in CaO2, CcSO2, MBF, mDO2, mVO2, ER, and EN/EP after DMVA1 compared to CPR. Only mVO2 and ER improved significantly after DMVA2. These findings support the concept that physical diastolic augmentation may improve myocardial hemodynamics when DMVA is applied during cardiac arrest.\r"

To test the casual roles of VF and resuscitation variables in this electrolyte change, we studied six groups of dogs: VF with CPR and electrical cardioversion (n = 9), control dogs with no intervention (n = 9), CPR without arrhythmia (n = 5), electrical cardioversion without arrhythmia (n = 5), CPR and cardioversion without arrhythmia (n = 5), and rapid right ventricular pacing (n = 5) (pacing rate 374 +/- 68 beat/min; BP 79/52 mm Hg during pacing). Blood for K, Ca, Mg, and glucose analysis was collected before each intervention (or at baseline in control animals) and sequentially for 3 hr. Mg had a maximum change of 0.3 mEq/L in the VF group 7 min after resuscitation, but did not change in the other groups (p less than .005). Glucose had a maximum change of 79 mg/dl in the VF group 7 min after resuscitation but did not change in the other groups (p less than .005). Ca had a maximum decrease of 0.4 mg/dl in the VF group 15 min after resuscitation but did not decrease in the other groups (p less than .005). K had a maximum decrease of 0.8 mEq/L in the VF group 60 min after resuscitation, whereas decreases were less in the other groups (p less than .005). Thus, VF caused a rapid rise in Mg and glucose followed by a fall in Ca and K. These changes were independent of resuscitation efforts as well as the moderate hypotension induced by rapid right ventricular pacing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five anesthetized dogs were instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring and then given 600 mg/kg of elemental iron as ferrous sulfate. After a 3-h absorption period, CAVH was begun from the femoral artery to femoral vein. Deferoxamine was infused into the arterial lines of the CAVH cartridge at increasing doses. We found a dose-dependent increase in the ultrafiltrate excretion of iron. However, most of the deferoxamine was excreted unbound. The efficiency of complex formation was greater at lower BP and ultrafiltrate formation rate, suggesting that inadequate mixing of deferoxamine with blood may occur when arterial administration is used. Iron excretion in the urine over the same time period was not significantly greater than that removed by CAVH. We conclude that CAVH can remove iron using deferoxamine as a chelating agent.\r"

Our program resolves Adair's equation and the shunt equation inversely, on the assumption that intrapulmonary venous admixture and the arteriovenous oxygen content difference remain constant during the study. The study was conducted on 19 patients with respiratory failure who were intubated and mechanically ventilated. According to linear regression analysis, regression coefficients of 0.91 and 0.97 were obtained between the measured PaO2 values and those estimated by the arterial/alveolar oxygen tension ratio (PaO2/PaO2) and our program, respectively (n = 23). The PaO2 values were predicted more accurately by our program than those calculated by PaO2/PaO2. Because our program is simple enough to be carried out with a pocket computer, it may be helpful in a bedside decision of lowering FIO2, especially in patients who require a high FIO2 level to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation.\r"

Each received standardized written, videotaped, and individual instruction. First the novice, then the reference examiner, measured QtDopp or Qtbi in triplicate in an adult male subject. The reference examiner was blind to the novice measurements and the novice was not informed of the reference measurements. Each novice repeatedly measured QtDopp or Qtbi in different subjects until the mean novice QtDopp or Qtbi was within 10% of the corresponding mean reference measurement in three of four consecutive subjects. The novice observers required an average of 12.9 +/- 3.5 trials to learn to measure QtDopp, and an average of 8.4 +/- 4.5 trials to learn to measure Qtbi. The likelihood of novice agreement with the reference improved with experience. The same degree of intraobserver variability as reported for Qt measured by thermodilution (coefficient of variance less than or equal to 10%) was achieved with Qtbi in 150 (99%) of 152 triplicate measurements and QtDopp in 216 (97%) of 222 triplicate measurements. More importantly, interobserver agreement (within 10%) was achieved with both Qtbi and QtDopp. Reproducible noninvasive Qt measurement will allow these techniques to be used to monitor trend changes in Qt.\r"

Only five patients were dissatisfied with their treatment: two were greater than 70 yr, the other three were 27, 62, and 65 yr. We did not interview a large number of patients and thus, cannot draw far-reaching conclusions without additional study. Nevertheless, although we expected that older patients would be particularly distressed about their treatments and hence, say they would decline them in the future, in this study both the older and the younger patients were highly accepting of the treatment they received.\r"

  ".W": "During breath holding, correlations have been demonstrated between the rate of fall of arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (dSaO2/dt) and the following: thoracic gas volume at apnea onset, resting oxygen consumption, preapneic arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) and obesity. A key factor influencing dSaO2/dt is mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SvO2) as recently demonstrated in an animal model of obstructive apnea. The purpose of the present study was to see if dSaO2/dt was related to SvO2 during sleep in a group of subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and varying levels of SvO2. Eight OSA subjects were studied during sleep with indwelling arterial and central venous catheters. Continuous SaO2 was measured by ear oximetry while continuous SvO2 was measured through the fiberoptic bundle of a Shaw Opticath catheter. Thirty percent or more of all obstructive apneas were scored for duration, preapneic SaO2, SvO2 and dSaO2/dt. Least squares regression was used to examine the relationship between dSaO2/dt and other measured variables. The dSaO2/dt showed a consistent negative correlation with preapneic SvO2 and was not related to duration. Mean dSaO2/dt during sleep correlated to some degree with the degree of gas exchange (Qva/Qt) abnormality prior to sleep. It is concluded that in humans, SvO2 plays a substantial role in determining dSaO2/dt. Potentially, the presence of gas exchange abnormalities (eg, found in intrinsic lung disease) causing hypoxemia and low SvO2 may steepen dSaO2/dt, lowering the nadir level of apneic desaturation for the same duration of apnea found in a patient with more normal gas exchange.\r"

  ".W": "The role of CT in the diagnosis of intrathoracic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was evaluated retrospectively in 24 patients, in the absence of coexistent opportunistic infections. In all cases the diagnosis of KS was initially established by histologic evaluation of extrathoracic disease: 15 patients had verified parenchymal KS and nine patients endobronchial KS. (Chest roentgenograms were analyzed separately for each group: in 14 patients serial films were available for review. The predominant radiographic findings was the presence of nonspecific, bilateral, perihilar infiltrates in 22 of 24 cases (92 percent). Corresponding CT scans documented the presence of abnormal hilar densities characteristically extending into the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma along distinctly perivascular and peribronchial pathways. Discrete, poorly marginated nodules were identified radiographically in ten cases (42 percent); these proved to be randomly distributed throughout the parenchyma on CT. Radiographic evidence of mediastinal adenopathy was distinctly unusual, seen in only two cases (8 percent). While CT typically demonstrated shotty adenopathy, significantly enlarged nodes (greater than 1 cm) were rarely identified. We concluded that CT is more specific than routine roentgenograms for identifying pulmonary KS. While not pathognomonic, peribronchial and perivascular disease is sufficiently characteristic to obviate more invasive diagnostic procedures, especially in patients with established KS.\r"

In addition to standard polysomnography, they underwent pulmonary function tests, right heart catheterization, and ventilatory response tests to hypercapnia. Nineteen patients (19 percent) had a resting PAP greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg. Multiple regression analysis showed that FEV1 and PaO2 (both with a negative coefficient) and PaCO2 (with a positive coefficient) significantly contributed to PAP. Thirteen patients (12 percent) had a PaCO2 greater than or equal to 45 mm Hg. A multiple regression analysis showed that FEV1 and the minute ventilation at PETCO2 = 60 mm Hg (both with a negative coefficient) and the cumulative apnea duration (with a positive coefficient) significantly contributed to PaCO2. Thirty-seven patients (33 percent) had a PaO2 less than or equal to 65 mm Hg. A multiple regression analysis showed that FEV1 (with a positive coefficient) and the hypopnea + apnea index (with a negative coefficient) significantly contributed to PaO2. These data confirm that impaired daytime pulmonary function (diffuse airway obstruction) contributes to the development of daytime pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia in OSA patients. They show that the amount of sleep-related breathing disorders also plays a significant role.\r"

  ".W": "Single lung transplantation (SLT) has been considered physiologically inappropriate for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has been postulated that the high static compliance and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance of the native lung functioning in parallel with the more normal allografted lung could cause unacceptable ventilation-perfusion mismatching and/or overinflation of the native lung with encroachment on the expansion of the transplanted lung. While some degree of ventilation-perfusion imbalance may be physiologically obligatory after SLT for COPD, a significant disruption in gas exchange may not occur unless a complication, such as rejection or infection, arises in the transplanted lung. A 60-year-old man with COPD who underwent successful SLT is presented and discussed. In spite of scintigraphic evidence of ventilation-perfusion mismatching between the native lung and the allograft during the first six postoperative weeks, the recipient had normal resting gas exchange on room air after the second postoperative week. Fourteen weeks after transplantation, his maximum oxygen uptake was 37.3 percent of the predicted maximal value, and no evidence of ventilatory limitation was detected. His functional status and lifestyle have been markedly improved by SLT. The role of SLT for COPD should be reconsidered. It may be a reasonable transplantation alternative for selected patients with COPD who are not candidates for double lung transplantation (DLT).\r"

Mean intrapair differences (unadjusted and adjusted for height) were compared using t tests of independent samples. Within pair, Holzinger's, and Falconer's heritability estimates were calculated using height-adjusted residual values. When total variances of a function parameter were statistically different between monozygotes and dizygotes, the among component heritability estimate was calculated and used as the best indicator of heritability. Following adjustment for height, no measure of pulmonary function which satisfied the requirements of the analysis was found to be significantly heritable.\r"

However, the effects of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction on pulmonary gas exchange in man have not been systematically studied. We empirically noted marked decreases in PaO2 in some asthmatic subjects following induced bronchoconstriction. Nine subjects with mild, stable asthma were studied, each on two separate days. The first determined the dose of inhaled histamine necessary to decrease FEV1 by 20 percent and the relationship to lung volume and to pulmonary resistance by the interrupter technique (Rint). On the second day arterial blood gases, ventilation, Rint, and the anatomic (VDan) and physiologic (VDphys) dead spaces were measured simultaneously. There was a significant (p less than 0.05), profound fall in PaO2 (mean, -21.8 mm Hg) and in P(A-a)O2 (mean +14.7 mm Hg) within 5 min after bronchoconstriction, associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in respiratory frequency (mean +5.1 min-1); and decrease in tidal volume (mean, -0.3 L). The ratio VDphys/VT increased significantly (p less than 0.05; mean change, +0.08) even though VDan and VDphys did not. Bronchoconstriction induced the broadening of ventilation (V)/perfusion (Q) ratios, with, most likely, an increase in areas of high V/Q. Histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in mild asthma results in a marked fall in PaO2 due to induced V/Q inequality. Therefore, histamine airway challenge should be used with caution in patients with any preexisting hypoxemia.\r"

Dyspnea ratings were obtained by two independent observers for each clinical method. Perceived magnitude of four elastic loads was selected from the Borg category scale; these estimates were summarized using the psychophysical power function equation. Ten age-matched healthy subjects also scaled the magnitude of added elastic loads. Dyspnea ratings from the three clinical scales were significantly interrelated. Mean exponents for mouth pressure developed during elastic loading were similar in the patient and control groups. Dyspnea ratings and exponents for elastic loads were not significantly correlated in ILD patients. Of the physiologic parameters examined, Dsb and gas exchange during exercise correlated significantly with clinical dyspnea ratings; none correlated with the exponent for added elastic loads. These data demonstrate that clinical dyspnea ratings provide valid measures of breathlessness in patients with ILD which are independent of the perception of respiratory loads.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the short-term effects of a methylxanthine (doxofylline) on respiratory mechanics in mechanically ventilated patients with airway obstruction and respiratory failure, nine consecutive patients were examined within three days from the onset of mechanical ventilation. Flow, changes in pulmonary volume, and Paw were measured using a ventilator (Servo 900C). End-expiratory and end-inspiratory airway occlusion was performed to measure PEEPi, Cstrs, Rrsmax, and Rrsmin. Measurements were performed before and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes after an intravenous loading dose of doxofylline (5 to 6 mg/kg). We found that doxofylline determined, on the average, a marked decrease in respiratory resistance (Rrsmax and Rrsmin, -27.2 percent and -36.5 percent, respectively) without significant changes in Cstrs and Pmax. The PEEPi, reflecting pulmonary dynamic hyperinflation, was also significantly decreased by doxofylline (-41 percent, on the average). The Pmax was not reliable for evaluation of a single patient, since changes in the elastic pressure can offset changes in the resistive one. No patient experienced significant side effects due to doxofylline. We conclude that (1) the effects of therapy can be assessed noninvasively at bedside in critically ill patients; (2) doxofylline is a rapid and efficient bronchodilator in mechanically ventilated patients with ARF and airflow obstruction; and (3) the decrease in the respiratory resistance and PEEPi, associated with an improved mechanical efficiency of the respiratory muscles at a lower pulmonary volume, can provide better conditions for the patient-ventilator interaction and for weaning.\r"

Because published experience with this technique remains limited, the current research reports the Cleveland Clinic experience with the CIRS model III pulmonary nodule reference phantom. Without knowledge of the final diagnosis, the nodule phantom was used as the standard for categorizing 31 nodules in 29 patients as either benign or indeterminate. Secure diagnoses were obtained in all cases. Eleven nodules were called benign and ten proved so, whereas 20 nodules were classified as indeterminate. One lesion, an adenocarcinoma, was falsely called benign using this technique. The excellent density discrimination achieved with CT makes this a superior tool for analysis of the solitary pulmonary nodule, and the nodule reference phantom has greatly simplified the technique of CT densitometry. As demonstrated by this and prior studies, calcification is not a unique feature of the benign lesion and successful clinical application of this technique requires cautious interpretation of results.\r"

Cytolytic lymphocytes are major effector cells of the immune response that have not been extensively studied in these disorders. To investigate the role of activated cytolytic lymphocytes in IPF, we studied B-cell and monocyte/macrophage-depleted lymphocyte preparations isolated from BAL fluid and peripheral blood of patients with this disease (n = 10) and used a lectin-dependent cytotoxicity assay to detect activated cytolytic lymphocytes. In longitudinal studies, those patients who had cytolytic activity of BAL fluid lymphocytes (range, 8 to 35 percent, n = 4) showed significant improvement in pulmonary function (mean increase in diffusing capacity, 30 +/- 2 percent) in association with decreased BAL fluid cytolytic lymphocyte activity after prednisone treatment. In contrast, patients who initially lacked cytolytic activity in BAL fluid (n = 6) did not improve with prednisone. Activated cytolytic lymphocytes were not observed in the BAL fluid of healthy subjects. These investigations suggest a causal relationship between activated cytolytic lymphocytes in the lung and disease activity in IPF and that assays of activated cytolytic lymphocytes are helpful in identifying patients who will improve with immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

The inhalation of xenon results in changes in density which can be detected and measured in Hounsfield units using ultrafast computed tomography. Using this property and assuming a monoexponential form for the washin curve of the inert gas, it is possible to calculate ventilation at a local level. The methodology also permits measurements of minute ventilation during the procedure, thus permitting standardization. Using this technique, we calculated local ventilation in six normal subjects and have demonstrated a minor gradient in ventilation between the dorsal and ventral regions of the lung while in the supine position.\r"

The FEV1 of gin workers completing all four years of the study declined 27.3 ml vs 35.5 ml in control subjects (p = 0.37); FEV1/FVC declined 0.21 percent in gin workers and 0.23 percent in control subjects (p = 0.86); FEF25-75% declined 0.058 L/s in gin workers and 0.066 L/s in control subjects (p = 0.68). Also, the mean annual rate of change of FEV1 was less among the gin workers who did not complete all four years than the gin workers completing all four years. The presence of \"byssinosis\" symptoms did not significantly influence the results. This prospective, longitudinal study failed to find any detrimental effect of the cotton gin environment on the rate of decline of FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75%. This result was independent of \"byssinosis\" symptoms and the effect of \"dropouts.\"\r"

Compared with a normal control group, patients exhibited a significant decrease in lung volumes and in MIP; VT and inspiratory time (Ti) were significantly lower, while VT/Ti, P0.1, and both EMGd and EMGint were significantly greater in patients. During a CO2 rebreathing test, patients exhibited significantly greater EMGd, EMGint, and P0.1 responses to increasing PETCO2 than the control group. VE response slopes were similar in the two groups. For a given EMGd response slope (delta XP/Ti/delta PETCO2), the average P0.1 response slope (delta P0.1/delta PETCO2) was found to be significantly lower in patients than in the normal control group. Compared with normal subjects, CILD patients have a normal or increased neural component of respiratory activity and relatively low neuromuscular coupling (delta P0.1/delta XP/Ti). The decreased neuromuscular coupling could be explained in these patients by a reduced inspiratory muscle strength.\r"

These specimens of sputum grew normal oral flora in the three cases. The diagnosis was confirmed by positive blood cultures in all three patients from each of two separate samples of blood. The isolates were identified as S uberis. There is no precedent in the literature of primary pneumonia due to viridans streptococci complicated by bacteremia in normal adults. We wonder if primary pneumonia due to viridans streptococci is not as rare as has been reported in the literature. Also, Gram stain of the sputum had a very significant contribution in the initial management of these patients. All of these patients subjectively showed improvement in 24 hours and became afebrile within three days of starting penicillin therapy.\r"

Pulmonary tuberculosis was the second most common cause after bacterial infections. Clinical and radiographic presentations of 12 patients with tuberculosis were nonspecific. Flexible bronchoscopy for tuberculosis carried a diagnostic sensitivity of 91.7 percent. We conclude that for the non-HIV infected ICP from areas where tuberculosis is endemic: M tuberculosis should be suspected as the pathogen; radiographic findings are diagnostically not helpful; FB is a sensitive diagnostic test for tuberculosis and in smear-negative cases where tuberculosis is suspected, initiation of empiric anti-tuberculosis therapy should be considered while awaiting culture results.\r"

Jogging in place continuously recorded via an ordinary single-channel electrocardiograph was compared with the Bruce treadmill protocol with a three-channel monitor and recorder in 141 cases with a wide spectrum of chest complaints. Agreement for the presence or absence of electrocardiographic ischemia (ST-segment displacement greater than or equal to 1 mm at 80 ms from the J point, or U-wave inversion) for the two tests was observed in 91 percent of the cases (95 percent confidence intervals: 86 percent to 95.5 percent). One hundred of the previous cases with paired electrocardiographic exercise tests were compared with the presence of reversible defects on exercise myocardial thallium-201 scintigraphy. The electrocardiographic ischemia had a similar correct classification rate in both methods (83 percent with jogging in place and 85 percent with Bruce treadmill protocol; not significant) against the finding of scintigraphic ischemia. This was also true for 52 cases having selective coronary arteriography. The correct classification rate was 54 percent (28/52) with jogging in place and 48 percent (25/52) with Bruce treadmill protocol (not significant). Given the safety and the easy applicability, even in older persons, this simplified test can be recommended as a valid alternative to the established multistage exercise tests.\r"

In 15 cases, selective pulmonary angiography revealed discrete arteriovenous fistulas. In five cases, the angiogram did not reveal any convincing evidence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. In two of these five cases, peripheral vein contrast echocardiography demonstrated right to left intrapulmonary shunting and seems a sensitive investigation.

To determine the applicability of the APACHE II system to AIDS, we related observed in-hospital death rates to those predicted by APACHE II in 83 patients with AIDS. In a control group of patients without AIDS (n = 166) mean predicted and observed death rates (34.1 vs 31.3 percent) were similar. For the AIDS group overall observed mortality (63.9 percent) was significantly greater than that predicted by APACHE II (45.8 percent). The subgroup with Pneumocystis pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 37) had an observed mortality (86.5 percent) that significantly exceeded the predicted value (44.3 percent), whereas all other AIDS patients (n = 46) showed similar predicted and observed death rates (47.0 vs 45.7 percent). APACHE II prediction of death rate also matched observed mortality in mechanically ventilated patients without Pneumocystis infection. The discrepancy between predicted and observed mortality in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation is most likely due to the lack of an APACHE II diagnostic category that accurately reflects the severity of this disease. A new diagnostic category that provides accurate outcome prediction in this patient group would form a basis for evaluation of new therapeutic interventions.\r"

Sternotomy and IMA harvesting may adversely affect postoperative respiratory function (PFTs) as disruption of the sternun may impair chest wall stability, and the decrease in intercostal muscle blood supply after removal of the IMA may reduce the force of respiration. We compared preoperative and six- to eight-week postoperative PFTs in patients undergoing CABG. The results were independent of age, sex, number of grafts, aortic cross clamp time, duration of bypass run, and postbypass fluid gradient. It was concluded that sternotomy caused a decrease in postoperative PFTs and that IMA harvesting may be accompanied by greater impairment in PFTs than when SV grafts alone were used.\r"

Five years later, she developed an overt interstitial lung disease characterized by fine crackles, diffuse parenchymal opacities and impaired diffusing capacity, preceded by an expansion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract, raising the hypothesis that these cells may be implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary derangement in sarcoidosis. This observation illustrates the importance of pulmonary follow-up of unaffected patients with systemic diseases and with subclinical inflammatory alveolitis, and the potential predictive value of neutrophil alveolitis in the pulmonary outcome of these patients.\r"

Some patients with this problem require proctocolectomy, yet other patients with minimal symptoms never require an operation for treatment of the rectovaginal fistula. For a small percentage of patients, local surgical repair of the fistula may be warranted. Since 1980, this study has attempted local repair in seven patients with symptomatic rectovaginal fistulas from Crohn's disease. Five patients underwent staged repair of the fistula. Closure of the colostomy was eventually possible in three of these patients. Two of the three patients have had no evidence of recurrence at followup in excess of two years. The third patient required an ileostomy for intestinal disease and had no recurrence of the fistula. Two patients underwent primary repair of the rectovaginal fistula without fecal diversion; in one of these patients, the fistula recurred ten days after operation, necessitating a diverting ileostomy. The other patient remains cured 26 months after repair. The results of this review indicate that in the setting of quiescent rectal disease, an attempt to repair the fistula can be expected to have a reasonable chance of success. The presence of a rectovaginal fistula in a patient with Crohn's disease does not mandate removal of the rectum.\r"

  ".W": "The management of patients with invasive carcinoma removed by colonoscopic polypectomy remains controversial. In order to assess the criteria for subsequent surgery after polypectomy, the histologic findings and outcome of 25 patients with invasive carcinomas treated by polypectomy were analyzed. Subsequent surgery was indicated when removed invasive carcinoma showed at least one of the following findings: 1) carcinoma near the surgical margin, 2) vessel invasion, 3) massive invasion, and 4) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The authors considered those findings to be a risk factor for local residual carcinoma or lymph-node metastases, or both. Of 25 patients, 18 showed risk factors, with 16 receiving surgery. Only one had residual carcinoma in the lymphatic vessel of the surgical specimen. The remaining 15 had no carcinoma in the surgical specimens, however, one died of recurrent disease 55 months later. Two patients with risk factors received no surgery for various reasons. Local recurrent carcinoma developed in one 39 months later and the other had no recurrent carcinoma at autopsy. Seven patients without risk factors were adequately treated by polypectomy without recurrent disease 34 to 96 months later (average, 69 months). Consequently, of 18 patients with risk factors, 3 showed either residual carcinoma in the surgical specimens or recurrent carcinoma was found later. None of 7 patients without risk factors developed recurrent disease. We recommend that patients with risk factors be followed by surgery; however, patients without risk factors can be adequately treated by polypectomy alone.\r"

Incontinence was observed in 95 patients (58 per cent) before surgery, whereas it persisted in only 21 of 135 patients (16 percent) after surgery. Forty patients (24 percent) claimed constipation before surgery, whereas 60 of 135 patients (44 percent) had constipation after rectopexy. Recurrence of full-thickness rectal prolapse was found in only 2 patients-(1.5 percent). Mucosal prolapse occurred in 9 patients (7 percent) after surgery. These results indicate that abdominal posterior rectopexy using Marlex mesh is an effective operation for rectal prolapse, but persistent incontinence occurs in one third of patients and almost half become constipated after the procedure.\r"

There were 50 patients ranging in age from 7 to 39 years. Five cases were associated with either ulcerative colitis (2) or familial polyposis (3). The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (66 percent), hematochezia (60 percent), change in bowel habit (41 percent) and weight loss (30 percent). On pathologic staging (N = 44), only 14 of 44 (31 percent) had a Dukes' stage A or B lesion, 20 (45 percent) had Dukes' stage C, and the remaining 10 (23 percent) had distant metastases at the time of surgery. Five-year survival rate was 28 percent with a disease-free survival rate of 18 percent. Median survival was only 28 months. Negative prognostic factors were Dukes' stage C/D (P less than .001), symptom duration of longer than 3 months (P = .01), noncaucasian ancestry (P = .01), and poorly differentiated histology (P = .06). In contrast to older patients with colorectal cancer, only 1 of 30 (3 percent) patients with stage C D disease was disease-free at 5 years. In view of the poor survival rate associated with both delay in diagnosis and the presence of advanced disease, it was concluded that young patients presenting with the symptoms listed above need early, aggressive evaluation for possible colorectal cancer.\r"

Early surgical therapy was advocated, the theory being, that perianal fistulas start as intersphincteric fistulas. This fistula is easily controlled surgically by fistulotomy with partial internal and sphincterotomy. Delay in surgical treatment, especially in Crohn's patients, results in more complicated fistulas that may require colostomy or proctectomy. The presence of Crohn's disease did not affect the healing of fistulotomy. In our series fistulotomy was the treatment of choice in patients with 26 fistulas; 18 of 19 went on to full healing. We conclude that early fistulotomy, before an intersphincteric fistula has time to blossom into a more difficult management problem, is the treatment of choice in patients with Crohn's disease who have perianal fistulas.\r"

Sixty-eight patients (73 percent) had systemic symptoms and signs consistent with serious sepsis. There has been a growing popularity of the Hartmann procedure throughout the study period. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 10.8 percent. Because of a high proportion of poor-risk patients, the Hartmann group fared particularly badly compared with those who had other operations, with a 28 percent mortality rate, 69 percent incidence of major complications, and one third of the survivors having a permanent colostomy. Other operative procedures are discussed, but until prospective data become available, it is unlikely that the widespread popularity of the Hartmann procedure will decline. Therefore, the importance of meticulous attention to technical detail is stressed if results are to improve.\r"

Experimental operative models were created, in which in Group 1, the half intestinal tract, the ileum, and the right side of colon were released from bile. In Group 2, both sides of the colon contained bile. The sham operated animals formed Group 3. These techniques changed the concentration of bile acid in different parts of the colon, and the daily total fecal bile acid excretion as well. After DMH treatment, the relationship between these changes of bile acid level and the development of colon cancer was studied. Significantly more tumors than in the control group were found if the daily total bile acid level and the bile acid concentration in the left side of the colon were increased. Our findings show an unambiguous connection between the fecal bile acid level and the incidence of DMH-induced colon cancer.\r"

Surgery proceeded as planned in 54 patients; however, colonoscopic findings extended the resection to include additional segments of bowel in 4. In four patients, polypectomy or bowel resection was avoided as a result of the colonoscopic findings. Intraoperative colonoscopy was not possible in four patients. No complications were related directly to this procedure. Intraoperative colonoscopy is a useful adjunct for localizing lesions or \"clearing\" the colon. In some patients, colonoscopic findings may change the extent of resection performed.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the carcinogenetic and growth inhibitory effects of OK-432, large-bowel carcinoma was induced experimentally in rats by intrarectal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), and OK-432 was administered intradermally. Rats were sacrificed after six months and the large intestine was cut into serial sections. Histopathologic examination and analysis of the infiltrating mononuclear cells, using monoclonal antibodies, were performed. The average rate of carcinogenesis per rat was 15.7 +/- 8.5 in the MNU alone group (n = 10) and 8.3 +/- 3.5 in the MNU and OK-432 group (n = 6). The invasion was deeper than the muscularis propria in 16 out of 157 lesions (10.2 percent) in the MNU alone group and in one out of 50 lesions in the MNU + OK-432 group (2.0 percent) (P less than 0.05). When time of appearance of atypical glands or carcinomas were compared in the MNU alone and MNU + OK-432 group, carcinogenesis was found to be delayed in the MNU + OK-432 group. In the investigation of infiltrating mononuclear cells using monoclonal antibodies, there were increases in helper T cells in both the MNU alone and MNU + OK-432 groups, but there was little difference between the two groups. The results of this study suggest that the suppression of experimental carcinogenesis in the large bowel by the concomitant administration of OK-432 with MNU, may be due to the enhanced activation or prolonged activated state of immunocompetent cells, which appear via antigen recognition, by OK-432.\r"

Three others seen at this institution outside the time frame of the author's study have also been included. Among six new cases, five with cologastric fistula occurred among 907 patients with Crohn's disease involving the colon (0.6 percent), while only one with ileogastric fistula was encountered among 1211 patients with ileal disease (0.08 percent). Fistulas between the stomach and colon always originated in an area of colitis, usually passing from distal transverse colon to greater curvature, but occasionally from midtransverse colon to antrum. The only pathognomonic clinical features were feculent vomiting, eructations, or odor. Diagnosis usually was made by barium enema or, less frequently, by upper gastrointestinal series; rarely, the gastric fistula was found unexpectedly at surgery. The conventional and recommended therapy is colectomy with wedge excision of the stomach. Medical treatment with 6-mercaptopurine has been completely successful in one patient and intermittently successful in a second patient.\r"

Nine (38 percent) of 24 patients undergoing the ileoanal pouch procedure developed hair loss. Clinically apparent hair loss is more likely in females. The cause is probably multifactorial and is unlikely to be related to specific nutritional deficiencies in patients maintaining oral intake of nutrients. Hair loss in the perioperative period is transient and hair growth returns to normal as the patient recovers. Awareness of this problem is important and reassurance of the concerned patient is the appropriate management.\r"

Associated diseases among 13 patients younger than 65 included renal failure in seven patients and hematologic, vasculitic, or collagen vascular diseases in four. In 26 patients 65 or older, congestive heart failure was seen in 13, vascular disease in eight, and previous aortic surgery in four. Nineteen patients were treated nonsurgically and 8 died (42 percent mortality). Twenty patients (51 percent) underwent surgery: 18 had resection with colostomy or ileostomy and two had resection with reanastomosis; one patient underwent laparotomy followed by second-look exploration without resection. Thirteen of the 20 surgical patients died (65 percent mortality). Both patients who underwent reanastomosis died of sepsis. The data show a close association between ischemic colitis and a number of serious systemic diseases including renal failure, arteriosclerotic heart and vascular disease, and hematologic, vasculitic, and connective-tissue disease. A predilection for the right colon and sigmoid colon and splenic flexure was seen. A formidable mortality rate (53 percent) was found among patients treated both surgically and nonsurgically.\r"

A positive family history for colorectal cancer was found in six patients (15 percent). Fifty percent of patients under age 30 had metastatic disease at diagnosis. Twenty-seven patients (69 percent) had potentially curative resections. Of these, 17 (63 percent) had lymph-node metastasis. This rate is twice as high as in a group of 315 patients with rectal cancer over age 40 (31 percent). The overall five-year survival for young patients having curative resection was 53 percent. Noncolorectal cancer occurred in three patients in this series and six patients also had first-degree relatives with noncolorectal cancer. Young patients with rectal cancer appear to belong to a high-risk cancer group which often seems to have a genetic pattern of predisposition.\r"

Despite this stringent matching, spread was shown to be an important prognostic variable in univariate survival analysis. Estimated five-year survival for Astler-Coller C1 cases was just below 80 percent, equivalent to B2 (Dukes' B) cases. When spread was analyzed in the presence of additional prognostic variables (character of invasive margin and lymphocytic infiltration) by multivariate modeling, its independent prognostic status was maintained. Improved survival for C1 cases was not explained by a lower incidence of local pelvic recurrence. Mechanisms to account for the better prognosis are proposed. This study reaffirms the importance of multivariate techniques of analysis in the assessment of prognosis of patients with rectal cancer.\r"

Malignant transformation has been reported in 15 patients with \"ordinary\" condylomata acuminata as well. Twenty giant condylomata acuminata have been previously reported, six of which (30 percent) went on to develop squamous-cell carcinoma. The authors report eight cases of giant condylomata acuminata with invasive squamous-cell carcinoma developing in four patients. Light and electron microscopic methods were used to verify the diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma and/or giant condyloma acuminatum in our cases. Human papillomavirus (HPV), known to cause condylomata acuminata, is also known to induce these tumors. The authors support the hypothesis that giant condyloma acuminatum represents an intermediate lesion in a pathologic continuum from condyloma acuminatum to squamous-cell carcinoma. These lesions have a propensity for recurrence, likelihood of malignant transformation, and significant mortality. Therefore, early and radical local excision, and in cases of recurrence, invasion, or malignant transformation, abdominoperineal resection, along with vigilant follow-up, provides the only current hope for cure.\r"

The autopsy demonstrated colonic tumors in 32 of 34 rats treated with DMH (94.1 percent), but only in 15 of 40 rats (37.5 percent) treated with DMH-indomethacin. Successful kidney autotransplantation was accomplished in 20 of 32 DMH-treated rats (63 percent) and in 5 of 15 DMH-indomethacin-treated rats (33.3 percent). Thus, the induction of colonic tumors by DMH and successful kidney autotransplants can be substantially abrogated by synchronous treatment with indomethacin.\r"

Three patients with severe colonic and anorectal disease underwent proctocolectomy as the initial procedure. Of the 32 patients who had fistulotomy performed, complete healing occurred in 30. Seven patients who healed required more than one operation for fistula. One patient was left with an asymptomatic fistula, and one required proctectomy for persistent symptomatic fistula and proctitis. Success of operation correlated with absence of rectal disease and quiescent disease elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Aggressive medical treatment is required to control bowel disease preoperatively. In the majority of patients, subsequent surgery is justified and healing can be anticipated.\r"

The overall complication rate for creating a stoma was 36 percent. No differences in overall complication rate were encountered when comparing acute and elective management; however, high output stomas and necrosis were encountered more often in the acutely managed group. Preoperative contamination was followed more often by stomal retraction. Septic events, however, occurred less frequently than in the noncontaminated procedures. Adequate supply with antibiotics might account for the lack of difference in these complications between the two groups. Antibiotics might not have prevented low-grade infections giving rise to retractive reaction. The influence of body weight was evaluated by the Quetelait index. It was demonstrated that moderate obesity had no significant influence on the outcome of the procedure. Adipose patients had a statistically significant larger number of necroses. This may be due to the relatively short and fatty mesenterium causing a compromised circulation. The outcome of stoma surgery was greatly influenced by bowel quality. Crohn's disease and bowel ischemia were encountered in 50 percent of stoma complications. In ischemic disease, significantly more necrosis was found. Retraction of the stoma occurred more often in Crohn's disease. Chronic ulcerative colitis did not have a higher complication rate.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether levels of gastric distension seen during a meal have a satiety effect and whether the nutrient value of the meal was important. Four dogs were prepared with gastric, duodenal, and esophageal fistulas. Physiologic distension was determined by allowing the animals to eat liquid nutrient diet until sated and measuring the volume consumed and the time it took to consume it (means 2000 ml in 4 min). To test the effect of gastric distension on satiety, distension was produced during sham feeding by infusions of either liquid nutrient, inert liquid (Karaya), or by a water-filled balloon. Lower degrees of distension were also tested to determine if a dose-response relationship existed. Balloon, inert, and nutrient distension all inhibited sham feeding dose-dependently. Peak inhibitions of sham feeding caused by physiologic gastric distension (balloon, inert, nutrient) were 69 +/- 5%, 67 +/- 12%, and 61 +/- 6%, respectively. In all cases, maximal distension terminated sham feeding before the end of the feeding period. The effect of gastric distension on feeding was not blocked by pretreatment with atropine (50 micrograms/kg). Thus, graded degrees of gastric distension, comparable to those seen during ingestion of a normal meal, produced graded inhibition of food intake by a noncholinergic mechanism and independent of the nutrient properties of the food.\r"

  ".W": "Both meal-stimulated and nocturnal acid secretions have been shown to be abnormally increased in patients with duodenal ulcer. The relative efficacy of an acid-reducing regimen aimed specifically at controlling postprandial acid secretion compared with one that controls nocturnal acid secretion is, however, not known. The endoscopic healing rates at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 of three cimetidine regimens with identical total daily dose--bedtime (1200 mg), mealtime (400 mg three times a day with meals), and reference (200 mg three times a day with meals and 600 mg at bedtime)--were compared in a randomized study on 141 patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer. Evaluating endoscopists were blinded to patients' form and duration of treatment and their clinical progress; patients were unaware of the comparative design of the study. Life-table analysis for the 12 weeks of observation revealed that the mealtime regimen resulted in significantly (P less than 0.05) better healing rates than either the bedtime or the reference regimen. The differences were accounted for largely by the significantly (P less than 0.04) better healing rate at two weeks with the mealtime regimen (68%) than with either the bedtime (47%) or the reference (45%) regimen. These findings indicate that a regimen that aims at controlling meal-stimulated acid secretion achieves a faster healing rate than one that aims at controlling nocturnal acid secretion in the treatment of duodenal ulcer, and they suggest that postprandial acid secretion plays a greater role than nocturnal acid secretion in the pathophysiology of this condition.\r"

Additional biopsies of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were obtained for histologic evaluation. C. pylori was identified in 16 patients (16.8%), all of whom had evidence of acute and/or chronic gastritis. Significant discriminating factors between C. pylori-positive and -negative subjects included age at presentation (positive vs negative = 14.6 vs 9.9 years, P less than 0.01), biopsy-confirmed gastritis (100% vs 30.4%, P less than 0.001), and diagnosis of duodenitis alone (0% vs 46.8%, P less than 0.001). Risk for bacterial colonization was significantly higher in the presence of endoscopic gastritis (P less than 0.001). Among C. pylori-positive patients, none responded to standard antiulcer therapy (H2-receptor antagonists, antacids). Symptomatic and histologic remission was achieved utilizing combined therapy with bismuth subsalicylate and antibiotics. Seven of 79 C. pylori-negative patients with biopsy-proven gastritis who responded poorly to antisecretory therapy had the organism identified in follow-up antral biopsies; these patients improved clinically following treatment for C. pylori. These data suggest that C. pylori is a significant factor in the etiology of upper gastrointestinal tract inflammatory disease in pediatrics, and presence of the organism should be evaluated, particularly in children with evidence of acute and/or chronic gastritis.\r"

  ".W": "Pouch ileitis is the most poorly understood complication of ileal reservoir surgery. Variability in definition of this syndrome may account for differences in incidence rate, associated symptoms, and response rate to therapy present in the literature. Outcomes of 19 episodes of pouch ileitis in patients having undergone prior colectomy and continent ileostomy construction for presumed ulcerative colitis were analyzed. An episode of pouch ileitis was characterized by: (1) abdominal pain, (2) increased ileal output, (3) mucosal inflammation within the continent ileostomy, and (4) absence of other recognized concurrent postoperative complications. The mean time of occurrence after construction of the continent ileostomy was 25 months (range 3-54 months). The mean length of follow-up of patients included in this analysis was 49 months from the time of continent ileostomy construction (range 22-101 months). Associated clinical symptoms included bloody effluent (53%), nausea or emesis (47%), and fever (42%). Endoscopic features were often nonspecific, with mucosal erythema (84%), edema (79%), friability (58%), and mucosal ulceration (53%) the most common. In those episodes of pouch ileitis where ileoscopy revealed no evidence of mucosal ulceration, complete resolution of the episode occurred 89% of the time, with 78% treated with antibiotics alone. In those episodes where mucosal ulceration was described on ileoscopy, 40% of episodes completely resolved after medical treatment, 20% with antibiotics alone. The varied clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, and response to treatment raises the possibility that what has previously been described in the literature as pouch ileitis may be a heterogeneous group not of single etiology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Antagonists of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5HT3) receptors reduce the nausea induced by cisplatinum, but the effects of these agents on 5HT3 receptors in the human gut remain to be defined. We examined the actions of one of these drugs (Glaxo GR 38032F) on small intestinal transit and mouth-to-cecum transit times in healthy man. We also quantified its effects on the release of peptide YY (PYY), neurotensin, human pancreatic polypeptide, gastrin-cholecystokinin, and motilin. Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Following a single intravenous dose of GR 38032F (0.15 mg/kg), we measured the time to appearance in plasma of sulfapyridine after injection of salicylazosulfapyridine into the duodenum. This was used as a measure of duodenocecal transit. The appearance of hydrogen in breath after ingestion of a meal containing lactulose was also correspondingly used to quantify the mouth-to-cecum transit of the \"head\" of the meal. Gastrointestinal hormones were assayed in plasma by specific RIAs; samples were drawn fasting (10 min after injection) and after breakfast (358 calories: 15.7 g protein, 55.4 g carbohydrate, 8.1 g fat). The postprandial integrated response and peak release of PYY was decreased by GR 38032F. There was also a trend for the peak release of neurotensin to be reduced. GR 38032F did not significantly alter small intestinal transit times or mouth-to-cecum transit times. We conclude that GR 38032F does not have a major effect on small intestinal transit in health.\r"

Based on indirect evidence, we proposed that these motor patterns (bursts of phasic pressure waves that were propagated) would be propulsive, but the capacity of these stimulated patterns of motility to propel contents has not been established directly. Healthy, surviving dogs were provided with motility sensors and a cannula through which SCFAs could be instilled into the ileum. Boluses of SCFAs were much more likely to stimulate phasic bursts of motility than was saline. Scintigraphic studies using a gamma camera showed that the motility stimulated by SCFAs was propulsive and that the ileum was thereby emptied. We also tested whether SCFAs were equally effective stimuli during fasting and after food. SCFAs were equally effective during fasting and soon after food, but in the late postprandial period, when the meal reached the ileum, SCFAs were much less likely to stimulate motility. These observations shed further light on the capacity of the ileum to sense and react to the nature of the contents.\r"

In conscious dogs neurotensin (2.5, 5, and 10 pmol/kg/min) was intravenously infused during the propulsive motor pattern induced by an acaloric viscous meal. Motor patterns were recorded by seven closely spaced strain gauge transducers and analyzed by a computerized method. Luminal transit was measured fluoroscopically. Neurotensin changed the propulsive motor pattern induced by the acaloric meal into a segmenting pattern. Effects were dose-dependent and most striking at a dose of 10 pmol/kg/min. The transit of luminal contents decreased from 20 to 8 cm/min. This was achieved by the increase in the number of stationary contractions (31 vs 55%), the reduction in the length of contraction spread (3.8 vs 1.8 cm), and the decrease in the number of contractions (11.5 vs 9.2 contractions/min). The contraction force was enhanced from 67 to 107 mN. Because of the marked effects on ileal motor patterns, neurotensin might be involved in the regulation of digestive motility in the distal small intestine.\r"

One hundred-fifteen adult IBD patients were studied cross-sectionally and prospectively, 48 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 67 with Crohn's disease (CD). Sequential samples of plasma were assayed for VIP by specific radioimmunoassay. Sixty males and 55 females, ranging in age from 22 to 76 years were studied over six months. The results revealed a strong, positive association between VIP levels and clinical activity, both at baseline (r = 0.38, P less than 0.001) and follow-up (r = .41, P less than 0.001). The ability of the VIP immunoassay to gauge clinical activity was also evaluated where VIP concentrations above 30 pg/ml were defined as abnormal. At baseline, sensitivity (specificity) was found to be 81% (55%). The predictive value of a positive (negative) test was 57% (80%). These estimates did not differ at follow-up. Examination of paired plasma samples from intermittently active patients revealed nearly twofold increases (P less than 0.05) in VIP concentration during active periods of disease. The data suggest that plasma VIP levels may be a valuable laboratory parameter in gauging activity in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of colon cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis is related to the duration and extent of disease. Prior reports have suggested that patients with onset of disease in childhood have a high risk of cancer. These risk factors were analyzed in 99 patients in a surveillance program of annual colonoscopy to detect mucosal dysplasia. All patients had pancolitis for at least eight years. The mean age at symptom onset was 23.2 years and the mean duration of disease at entry was 17 years. An average of 4.2 tests/patient were performed, and 91% were completely followed through 1985. Cancer risk was expressed as the hazard rate or the annual probability that a patient free of cancer would develop cancer after survival to a given time period. The hazard rate for high-grade dysplasia or cancer in patients with pancolitis measured from symptom onset was 2.5% at 20 years, 4% at 25 years, 7% at 30 years, 13% at 35 years, and 20% at 40 years. Sex was not a significant predictor of cancer, but older age at symptom onset was a predictor of dysplasia and cancer. From these data, the annual hazard rate of developing high-grade dysplasia or cancer can be estimated in patients with pancolitis based on an individual's age at symptom onset and duration of disease.\r"

Frequent bacteremias due to inadequate host defense mechanisms, particularly the reticuloendothelial system (RES), with seeding of an ascitic fluid that lacks a normal opsonic activity, is believed to be the principal cause of SBP. Little data exist as to the role of serum levels of complement and immunoglobulins as well as the cell-mediated immune system in the pathogenesis of SBP. The aim of this study was to determine the serum levels of the third and fourth components of complement (C3, C4), total hemolytic complement activity (CH100), and properdin factor B (PFB) and immunoglobulins G, A, and M and various T-cell parameters in individuals admitted to hospital with ascites and advanced liver disease and to determine whether one or more of these factors could be used to predict the development of SBP in patients with advanced liver disease. Fourteen consecutive patients (nine male and five female; age 47.5 +/- 3.1 years, mean +/- SEM) with end-stage liver disease and ascites, who were evaluated for possible liver transplant at the University of Pittsburgh and who developed SBP, comprised the study group. The diagnosis of SBP was determined by positive ascitic fluid culture (three patients) and/or ascitic fluid neutrophil count of greater than 250 cells/mm3 (all patients). The control group consisted of 14 patients, matched for type of liver disease, age, and sex, who did not develop SBP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such experiences often limit the willingness of patients to undergo subsequent follow-up biopsies. To investigate the ability of midazolam, a new water-soluble benzodiazepine preparation, noted for its potency, rapid onset of action, and amnestic qualities, to enhance patient acceptability of a follow-up liver biopsy, a \"sedative dose\" of midazolam (2 mg) or saline was administered immediately prior to and following a percutaneous liver biopsy. The initial dose was used to sedate the subject while not impairing patient cooperation during the biopsy procedure; the second dose was used to induce amnesia for the biopsy procedure. The next morning patient recollection for the preceding biopsy procedure and their willingness to undergo a future PLB were assessed using a questionnaire. Forty-one patients (ages 18-78) were randomized to receive either midazolam (N = 21) or saline/placebo N = 20) treatment. All PLBs were obtained with a Trucut needle. All subjects were given 2-5 cc of 2% xylocaine local anesthetic at the biopsy site. The questionnaire utilized evaluated patient experience of the procedure with respect to their recall, level of anxiety during the procedure, and willingness to undergo a repeat procedure. The data obtained revealed that those receiving midazolam admitted to experiencing less discomfort during the biopsy procedure (P less than 0.04) and had less memory for the procedure (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-two had segmental hepatic resections (HR), and 10 underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). The diagnosis of hepatic malignancy was established in each case preoperatively, and each case was studied intraoperatively by means of sonography. Postoperatively each surgical specimen was examined pathologically with attention to the possibility of intrahepatic tumor spread. Twenty-three of the 32 patients had single small HCC lesion (less than 5 cm diameter) identified preoperatively. Sixteen of these underwent HR and seven underwent OLTx. Multiple additional neoplastic lesions were found in 19% of the 16 HR cases and in 14% of those undergoing OLTx when the resection specimens were examined pathologically. Vascular invasion was present in 43% of the OLTx patients and in 25% of the HR patients. Subtotal hepatic resection for small HCC occurring in cirrhosis has produced few long-term survivals. Both pre- and intraoperative sonography have been shown to underestimate the extent and distribution of these tumors. Based upon this experience that (1) vascular spread occurs often in HCC and (2) a high risk of postoperative hepatic failure can be expected after HR in cirrhotic individuals, OLTx is the most rational surgical procedure for such cases as it has the potential to cure.\r"

Cardiac output, pulmonary and systemic blood pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate, blood gases and serum amylase were measured. Cardiac index, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance, and the right and left stroke work were calculated. Systemic arterial and venous blood pressure and cardiac index gradually declined over 6 hr, while pulmonary mean blood pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance increased. Pretreatment of pancreatitis with catalase and superoxide dismutase prevented the rise in mean pulmonary blood pressure, moderated the rise in pulmonary vascular resistance, and decreased the rate and extent of the fall in cardiac index. These data suggest that reactive oxygen metabolites may play some role in the extraabdominal organ manifestations of acute pancreatitis.\r"

We also studied 10 reflux patients (mean age 42 years; seven males, three females) with symptoms at least five days a week and documented recumbent reflux, with or without upright reflux, by previous 24 hr pH study. A standard meal (56% fat) was provided at 6 PM. After randomization, the subjects and patients slept on the assigned bed (WB or RB) in one nearby hotel. The pH probe was removed the next morning at 8 AM. On the same day, the pH probe was inserted at 4 PM and the routine was repeated with use of the other bed. No significant difference (P greater than 0.05; paired t test) was found between the regular bed and waterbed in any measurement of recumbent reflux. Our study does not support the hypothesis that greater recumbent reflux may occur when sleeping flat on a waterbed compared to a regular bed. It does not, however, absolutely refute the possible association of waterbed use with esophagitis, since elevation of the head of a waterbed is not possible.\r"

In this investigation, 50 healthy volunteers were studied with (1) a 2.8-mm-diameter six-sensor catheter-mounted transducer assembly and (2) a 3.2 X 7.2-mm sleeve device linked to a computerized recorder with a pressure-sample rate of 32/sec. The study protocol included water, bread, and semisolid swallows. Upper esophageal sphincter (UES) tonic pressures measured with the catheter-mounted assembly were lower and more reproducible than pressures measured with the sleeve system. Compared with water, bread swallows showed greater pharyngeal and sphincter after-contraction pressures, while semisolid swallows had less complete sphincter relaxation. Duration of pharyngoesophageal contractions was greater with bread or semisolid than water. The observations have established normal values for measurements of UES function and, in addition, have shown that (1) catheter variables significantly influence the measurement of upper sphincter tonic pressure, (2) pressures recorded with the catheter-mounted transducer are most reproducible, and (3) pharyngoesophageal motility patterns vary significantly according to the substance swallowed.\r"

  ".W": "Peristaltic contractions of the distal esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter tone were evaluated in patients affected by gastroesophageal reflux disease after either acute intravenous (8.0 mg) administration or two oral doses (5.0 mg and 10.0 mg) of cisapride and in healthy controls after a 10.0-mg oral dose of cisapride. Intravenous cisapride administration enhanced the amplitude and duration of primary peristalsis and the lower esophageal sphincter tone, which reached normal control values. Likewise, the 10.0-mg oral dose effectively enhanced the lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure in both controls and in reflux patients, whereas the amplitude and duration of primary peristalsis was improved only in controls. The 5.0-mg oral dose of cisapride proved ineffective on distal esophageal motor activity in reflux patients. To evaluate whether atropine is capable of modifying the effects of cisapride on distal esophageal motor activity, cisapride was administered intravenously before and during intravenous atropine administration. Effects of cisapride on peristaltic contractions were completely blocked by atropine, irrespective of whether atropine was administered before or after cisapride. The lower esophageal sphincter pressure response to cisapride varied according to the sequence of drug administration, showing no effect when cisapride followed atropine administration and, when this sequence was reversed, no significant atropine-induced inhibition on cisapride-stimulated lower esophageal sphincter pressure. It is suggested that cisapride enhances distal esophageal motor activity by means of a muscarinic receptor mechanism at the level of the distal esophageal body and, at least in part, via a muscarinic-independent mechanism at the level of the lower esophageal sphincter.\r"

The present study sought to define the response of the sphincter to increased intraabdominal pressure (achieved by straight leg raising) by continuously monitoring it with the Dent sleeve in a group of 10 normal volunteers. A reproducible pressure profile was observed in both the sphincter and the stomach, characterized by an initial peak, a sustained plateau, and a second peak. The pressure profiles of the stomach and the sphincter were closely approximated and peak and plateau pressures for both did not differ significantly. The onset and offset of the pressure increase were simultaneous in the stomach and the sphincter. No significant changes in sphincter pressure were noted when the rapid pull-through technique was used. This study defines the pressure profiles of the stomach and the lower esophageal sphincter zone during increased intraabdominal pressure in man. Our data suggest that the response of the sphincter is passively mediated.\r"

Most participants (58%) reported that they went on eating binges, and 12% met the DSM-III criteria for a diagnosis of bulimia. Nearly 40% admitted to controlling their weight by insulin purging, and 13.5% reported purging by other means. A group of bulimic participants had mean scores on an eating disorder questionnaire in the pathological range. Bulimic symptoms were positively related to reports of hospitalizations, episodes of ketoacidosis, and psychological symptoms. Implications of these results on the medical management of young women with IDDM are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Occupational issues in 158 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) individuals and 158 matched nondiabetic siblings were examined in a case-control design to evaluate the role of diabetes in the employability of people with IDDM. Overall, the IDDM cases were more likely to report refusal for a job at some point in their lives (56 vs. 42%, P = .02) than were the nondiabetic control siblings. Surprisingly, individuals who told job interviewers about their diabetes were more likely to report job refusal than their siblings (64 vs. 42%, P = .005), whereas individuals who did not mention their diabetes reported rates of refusal similar to their siblings (44 vs. 41%). IDDM cases were also less likely to be employed full time compared with siblings (55 vs. 73%, P = .001). Reduced employment in IDDM respondents was related to work disability. Reported work disability was more than seven times greater in the IDDM than the sibling group. The presence of diabetic complications was the primary factor related to work disability. Although 13% of IDDM respondents were unable to work because of disability, absenteeism among IDDM cases currently working did not differ from that of the nondiabetic siblings. Diabetes was not significantly associated with career levels or household income levels reported by the IDDM group. Disability, however, had a strong detrimental influence on these variables. The results suggest that hiring practices by employers may still be discriminatory toward individuals with IDDM. Once hired, the employment experiences of the IDDM population appear to be similar to the experiences of the nondiabetic population, provided the development of disabling diabetic complications has not taken place.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the pathophysiological role of diabetes mellitus in determining the left ventricular regional function of the noninfarcted area, 55 patients with acute Q wave anterior myocardial infarction (MI) were studied. The regional ejection fraction of the noninfarcted area was obtained by radionuclide angiocardiography and was used to estimate the left ventricular regional function of the noninfarcted area. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the important variables contributing to the regional ejection fraction based on 10 clinical variables: age, sex, QRS score, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, postinfarction angina, body mass index, serum cholesterol, and coronary atherosclerosis. A high QRS score (P less than .001) and the association of diabetes mellitus (P less than .05) were the important factors contributing to regional left ventricular dysfunction. The regional ejection fraction and QRS score had an inverse linear relationship in the diabetic and nondiabetic groups, and the regional ejection fraction was significantly lower in diabetic patients at every QRS score (P less than .05). The association of hypertension, severity of coronary atherosclerosis, serum cholesterol level, age, and body mass index did not differ between diabetic and nondiabetic patients, which indicates that diabetes mellitus was not mediated through these atherogenic traits. Thus, diabetes mellitus is another discrete cause of regional left ventricular dysfunction of the noninfarcted area after acute MI.\r"

The examinations focused particularly on sensory symptomatic and physical evaluation. Standardized assessment of symptoms and physical testing of light touch, pain, vibratory, and thermal sensation was performed at the hand, wrist, elbow, foot, ankle, and knee. A total symptom score and physical score were defined by summing test scores at each site. Current perception threshold (CPT) testing that used constant sine-wave-alternating current was conducted at the same anatomic sites. CPT correlations with the physical score gave r values of .55 for 5 Hz, .60 for 250 Hz, and .62 for 2000 Hz (n = 618). Correlations with the symptom score were not as strong: r = .45 for 5 Hz, .46 for 250 Hz, and .51 for 2000 Hz. The correlation with symptom score was due primarily to a strong relationship for the symptom of numbness (r = .53 for all 3 frequencies). Correlations with pain and paresthesia were much lower. CPTs for diabetic subjects at the three frequencies were higher at most locations than for the nondiabetic volunteers. However, CPTs were no different from normal values in diabetic subjects without evidence of neuropathy. CPT testing appears to be a useful technique for assessment of diabetic sensory neuropathy.\r"

The aim of management is the reduction of such stresses with orthoses and insoles. An American hosiery manufacturer has developed socks designed to reduce stress on athletes' feet, and we report a preliminary evaluation of this technique in the reduction of elevated plantar pressure in 27 neuropathic diabetic patients. With a computerized optical pedobarograph, three footsteps on each side were recorded under three conditions: 1) barefoot, 2) wearing the patients' own hosiery, and 3) wearing experimental patented padded hosiery. The patients' own hosiery did not have a significant effect on plantar pressure, but the experimental hosiery reduced both peak forefoot pressure and the area under the time-pressure curve (P less than .001) by a mean of 26 and 29%, respectively. We conclude that the experimental hosiery is effective in reducing vertical pressures under the diabetic foot and, in conjunction with established orthotic techniques, may be a useful addition to the treatment of the diabetic patient at risk for foot ulceration.\r"

Data on the role of calcitonin in calcium regulation are inconsistent, and while a participation in some aspects of sexual maturation has been strongly indicated, the exact function is not known. To establish if there exists a functional relationship between 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and calcitonin in salmonid species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were injected ip with a single or repeated doses of E2. It is concluded that E2 treatment increases plasma calcitonin levels directly or indirectly, and that it is possible that E2 is responsible for the rise in calcitonin levels during late sexual maturation of female salmonids. In accord with earlier studies, no correlation was found between changes in calcitonin levels and free plasma calcium levels. It seems clear that changes in free plasma calcium levels are not the primary cause of the plasma calcitonin changes in teleost fish. It is possible that calcitonin is involved in mobilizing calcium or directing its mobilization by protection of certain calcium pools during vitellogenesis. However, the increase in calcitonin occurs so close to ovulation that a reproductive role other than a calcium regulatory one is likely. The possibility of transfer of calcitonin itself to the developing oocytes and a subsequent role in embryonic development must also be considered.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to compare the effects of various nutrients (fats, proteins, amino acids, and carbohydrates), given directly into the duodenum or the colon, on the release of peptide-YY (PYY) in conscious dogs. As reported previously, this study showed that plasma levels of PYY increased significantly (P less than 0.05) within 15 min in response to an oral mixed meal. Intraduodenal (ID) administration of a fatty acid (oleic acid; 100 mmol/L; 100 ml/h) stimulated a robust release of PYY, whereas ID administration of an amino acid mixture (phenylalanine plus tryptophan; 100 mmol/L each; 100 ml/h), glucose (1 g/kg), or a liver extract (10%; 100 ml/h) failed to elevate plasma levels of PYY. ID administration of glucose at 2 g/kg caused a mild but significant elevation in plasma PYY levels. Intracolonic administration of saline, a fatty acid, an amino acid mixture, glucose, or a liver extract significantly stimulated PYY release. This study suggests that as chyme moves from the stomach to the proximal bowel, fat is the primary constituent of food that stimulates the prompt release of PYY. However, unabsorbed nutrients can release PYY by a direct contact with the PYY-containing cells lining the intestinal lumen of the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum. Both mechanisms probably participate in the release of PYY.\r"

  ".W": "The secretory response of the primate corpus luteum (CL) to CG after implantation suggests that gonadotropin receptors are not depleted despite increasing CG production and continuous elevated tropic stimulation. Such continuous stimulation is known to cause down-regulation of receptors in other tissues. To determine if CG secretion is intermittent during the initial stages of CL rescue, we assessed the secretory pattern of CG during the periimplantation period by collecting frequent (4/h) blood samples in two studies (for 4 h on 3 separate days between days 8-13, or for 2 separate 13-h sequences between days 10-15 postovulation) in 13 chair-adapted females. Day 0 of gestation was defined as the day of ovulation, as estimated by peak urinary estrone conjugate excretion in females mated on days 9, 11, and 13 of the menstrual cycle. Hormone concentrations were measured by either RIA [irFSH; estradiol and progesterone (P)] or Leydig cell bioassay (bioLH or bioCG). In the first study, 4 of 6 females conceived, and the mean for bioLH was not significantly elevated until days 12-13. In the second study, 5 of 7 females conceived, and the episodic secretory pattern of circulating pituitary bioLH typically observed in cycling females (2.7 +/- 0.3 peaks/13 h) was replaced by a relatively nonpulsatile, but steadily increasing profile during days 12-15 of gestation (1.5 +/- 0.4 peaks/13 h). Although occasional large fluctuations in bioLH/CG and P were noted, the bioLH/P peaks were less congruent than those in nonfertile cycles, and there was no diurnal pattern in the secretion of either hormone. In contrast, irFSH concentrations did not fluctuate and were similar in the two groups of females [2.93 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.34 +/- 1.7 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM)]. These data demonstrate that 1) a steady, gradually increasing secretory pattern of CG is associated with rescue of the CL; 2) the circulating profile of CG during the periimplantation interval is not consistently episodic and does not support the hypothesis that intermittent CG release prevents LH/CG receptor down-regulation in the CL during early pregnancy; 3) increased bioLH/CG levels during conceptive cycles in rhesus monkeys are not detected until days 12-13 after the midcycle bioLH peak; 4) irFSH patterns on pooled aliquots appear to be uninformative with regard to gonadotropin dynamics in early pregnancy; and 5) urinary estrone conjugate measurements provide a practical method for the precise timing of infrequent events, such as implantation, in the laboratory macaque.\r"

Different sets of these sites are used in different neuroendocrine tissues. To learn more about the factors influencing the posttranslational processing of peptide hormone precursors, the cDNA for mouse PAE was cloned into a metallothionein expression vector. Two lines of rat GH-secreting tumor cells (GH3 and GC) were transfected with the resulting expression plasmid, and stable PAE-producing clones were isolated. Both GH3 and GC cells gave rise to clones in which about 75% of PAE was endoproteolytically processed. Mol wt distributions of PAE peptides were similar in cell extracts and medium, indicating that processing was not the result of extracellular proteases. The identity of immunoprecipitated molecules was confirmed by analysis of tryptic digests by reverse phase HPLC. Amidated forms of joining peptide were detected in the transfected cells by immunocytochemistry, adding evidence that GH-producing tumor cells can perform endoproteolysis, exoproteolysis, and alpha-amidation of the PAE precursor. One of the two forms of joining peptide from cell extracts was also shown to comigrate during reverse phase HPLC with authentic alpha-amidated mouse joining peptide. Comparisons of Northern analyses and peptide synthetic rates suggested that PAE mRNA was used for synthesis of PAE more efficiently in corticotropes than in the transfected GC cells.\r"

In this study, we tested the binding and effects of TNF on FRTL-5 cells and on four human thyroid carcinoma cell lines. The TSH-stimulated [125I]iodide uptake by FRTL-5 cells was inhibited by TNF in a dose-dependent manner. The four human thyroid carcinoma cell lines (NPA, MRO, ARO, WRO) have TSH receptors but did not respond to TSH in regard to iodide uptake and thymidine incorporation. Both human thyroid carcinoma cells and FRTL-5 cells contain specific receptors for TNF. Scatchard analysis showed that the receptor numbers and dissociation constants in human thyroid carcinoma cells and FRTL-5 cells were, respectively; 2.4 x 10(4), 5.4 nM (WRO); 8 x 10(3), 3.4 nM (MRO); 4 x 10(3), 1 nM (ARO); 7 x 10(3), 1 nM (NPA); 3 x 10(3), 1 nM (FRTL-5), and 9 x 10(3), 1 nM (FRTL-5 cells treated with TSH). The results indicate that TNF affects thyroid cell function through binding to the TNF receptor and that the number of TNF receptors is regulated by TSH.\r"

We have now extended these studies to investigate the actions of androgens on hPTH-stimulated accumulation of cAMP, and on the roles of new protein synthesis and pertussis toxin (PTox) substrates in the actions of steroid hormones on SaOS-2 cells. Pretreatment with testosterone (T) or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT) for 4-12 h at concentrations of 10(-12) to 10(-8) M inhibited significantly the cAMP response to hPTH by up to 50-70% of control. Like E2, the actions of T and 5 alpha-DHT were selective for hPTH or hPTHrP; there was no inhibition of the stimulatory action of vasoactive intestinal peptide. Two related steroids, 5 beta-DHT and 17 alpha-epitestosterone, did not inhibit the action of hPTH. Pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide, under conditions which inhibited protein synthesis by greater than 90%, reduced the cAMP response to hPTH but did not block the further inhibitory actions of E2, T, or 5 alpha-DHT. Pretreamtent of cells with PTox (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, enhanced the accumulation of cAMP stimulated by hPTH consistent with an action of PTox on Gi; however, the inhibitory actions of E2, T, and 5 alpha-DHT on PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation were not attenuated by PTox. We conclude that androgens, as well as estrogens, act directly on human bone cells to modulate selectively an early effect of hPTH. The inhibitory actions of these steroid hormones do not appear to depend on new protein synthesis and may not involve a functionally active PTox substrate, presumably Gi.\r"

However, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and progesterone (P), although inactive alone, can reverse the effect of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on PRL release both in vivo and in vitro. Using castrated male rats, we have studied the effect of E2 (0.25 micrograms), P (2 mg), or DHT (100 micrograms) administered twice daily for 14 days alone or in combination on pituitary PRL mRNA levels measured by quantitative in situ hybridization. Treatment with E2 increased the accumulation of PRL mRNA by about 2.6-fold. Administration of P or DHT alone failed to modify PRL mRNA concentrations. However, DHT could prevent by 80% the stimulatory effect of E2 on PRL mRNA levels. Similar results were obtained by dot blot hybridization assay. The effects of sex steroids on PRL mRNA were closely paralleled to pituitary PRL content measured by RIA. The present data demonstrate that the effect of sex steroids on immunodetectable PRL result from a modulation of PRL mRNA accumulation. The sexual dimorphism observed in pituitary PRL content results from a 3.5-fold greater accumulation of PRL mRNA in intact females than in male rats. These results also clearly show that quantitative in situ hybridization is a powerful tool in the investigation of the regulation of gene expression in addition to providing valuable information on the localization of specific mRNA.\r"

The structural parameters of the Sertoli cell and its subcellular organelles were assessed using accepted stereological procedures during active and inactive states of spermatogenesis, and the results correlated with a battery of endocrine parameters obtained from the same animals. Short photoperiod-induced testicular involution was associated with a significant decrease in virtually all morphological parameters of the Sertoli cell, including a dramatic decrease in the volumes and surface areas of the Sertoli cells and their major subcellular organelles. Sertoli cell size and surface area were significantly and positively correlated with the testicular weight, volume of the seminiferous tubule, tubular lumena, tubule diameter, and germ cell numbers. Similar correlations were recorded between the number of germ cells and nearly all subcellular parameters of the Sertoli cell. Only those structural elements that are related to degredative processes (lysosomes and lipid) did not show significant volumetric differences between gonadally active and inactive animals. The observed changes in the structural parameters of the Sertoli cells were significantly correlated with the reduction in plasma levels of FSH, LH, and testosterone and intratesticular levels of testosterone. Exposure of hamsters to a short photoperiod was also associated with an increase in concentration (femtomoles per mg protein), but a decrease in the total content (femtomoles per testis) of testicular FSH receptors. The dissociation of changes in the content and concentration of FSH receptors appears to be related to changes in basal compartment plasma membrane surface areas of the Sertoli cells during testicular regression. The striking changes in Sertoli cell morphology between active and inactive states of spermatogenesis are structural manifestations of alterations in the function of these cells in response to the concomitant endocrine changes in the testis and indicate a virtual shut-down of Sertoli cell function during short photoperiod-induced testicular regression.\r"

  ".W": "Spermatogenesis can be turned on or off in the seasonally breeding golden (Syrian) hamster in a laboratory setting by exposure of animals to different photoperiod regimens. The present study provides the first detailed quantitative analysis of the subcellular features of hamster Leydig cells during active and inactive phases of spermatogenesis and correlates these features with the endocrine activity of the same animals. Conventional stereological principles and accepted morphometric techniques were used to determine changes in a variety of subcellular constituents of Leydig cells at the extreme phases of gonadal activity produced by maintaining adult hamsters in a long photoperiod (16 h of light, 8 h of darkness) or by exposing them to a short photoperiod (6 h of light, 18 h of darkness) for 12-13 weeks. Compared with Leydig cells from gonadally active animals, Leydig cells obtained from the regressed testis showed a significant reduction in the absolute volume of nearly all of its organelles, including nucleolus (77.0%), mitochondria (50.0%), total endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (86.4%; cisternal ER, 87.0%; tubular ER, 85.5%), lipid (84.2%), peroxisomes (82.5%), multi-vesicular bodies (71.9%), filament-rich area (95.5%), and Golgi complex (69.4%). There was also a significant reduction in organelle surface area, namely outer (76.5%) and inner (72.7%) mitochondrial membrane, total ER (85.0%), cisternal (85.3%) and tubular (84.4%) forms of ER, and Golgi complex (70.0%). The surface areas of the plasma membrane and nuclear membrane were also decreased by 58.3% and 33.7%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the short photoperiod-induced cellular inactivity of Leydig cells is associated with an overall diminution in the volume and surface area of all major organelles, not only those specifically associated with steroid biosynthesis. Virtually every structural parameter of the Leydig cell was significantly and positively correlated with plasma LH levels and with both plasma and testicular concentrations of testosterone. The total content of LH receptors per testis and per Leydig cell was reduced, but the concentration of receptors per unit area of the Leydig cell surface remained unchanged. Correlation of changes in hormonal status with alterations of all Leydig cell organelles suggests a general shut-down of cellular activity in the gonadally regressed animals, rather than a specific effect of pituitary hormones on selected cellular constituents.\r"

Individual preovulatory follicles were obtained from PMSG-treated rats and incubated with these hormones in the absence or presence of LH. Oocyte maturation and progesterone production were monitored. Treatment with TGF alpha alone, but not with TGF beta or inhibin-related proteins, mimicked the action of LH on oocyte maturation by inducing the resumption of meiosis in follicle-enclosed oocytes (56.6% and 80.6% oocytes resumed meiosis in the presence of 0.5 and 1.0 microgram/ml TGF alpha, respectively). In follicle cultures treated with LH to induce oocyte maturation, cotreatment with inhibin and TGF beta (30-50 ng/ml), but not other related hormones, partially inhibited LH-induced meiosis in follicle-enclosed oocytes (from 82% mature ova in the presence of LH to 51% and 55% mature ova with TGF beta and inhibin, respectively). In contrast to follicle cultures, none of the hormones tested significantly affected the spontaneous maturation of rat oocytes explanted from their follicles and cultured within their cumulus mass for 4 h. Treatment with TGF alpha, but not with TGF beta, inhibin, activin, or follistatin, stimulated progesterone production. The present study demonstrated that TGF alpha, like LH, induces oocyte maturation and progesterone production in preovulatory rat follicles. Furthermore, inhibin and TGF beta suppressed LH-induced resumption of meiosis in follicle-enclosed oocytes. Because these growth factors and inhibin-related proteins are synthesized by follicle cells, they may play important roles in regulating follicular development and activity.\r"

We tested this hypothesis in the present study by evaluating the effect of perturbation of the serotonergic system on PRL secretion induced by fentanyl, a potent morphine-like analgesic. Female Sprague-Dawley rats ovariectomized for 3 weeks and given polyestradiol phosphate (0.1 mg/rat) for 1 week were used in the study. Fentanyl, at a dose of 20 micrograms/rat, induced significant PRL secretion that peaked at 10 min and lasted for more than 30 min. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.5 mg/kg BW, ip) did not block the acute phase of PRL secretion, but significantly lowered the PRL level at 30 min. Fentanyl at a smaller dose (5 micrograms/rat, iv) still induced significant PRL release 10, but not 30, min after injection. This effect was significantly blocked by pretreatment with the same dose of naloxone. On the other hand, whereas animals pretreated with ketanserin or LY53857 (both at a dose of 5 mg/kg BW, ip), two specific 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, had no effect on fentanyl-induced PRL secretion, the same treatment significantly blocked 5-HT-induced PRL secretion. Likewise, pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (250 mg/kg BW, ip), a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, for 2 days had no effect on the action of fentanyl, while 5-HT-induced PRL secretion was significantly augmented. We conclude that fentanyl acts through mu-opiate receptors to stimulate PRL secretion in a process that does not involve the serotonergic system.\r"

In the present study we report that in 20-day-old vitamin D-deficient Wistar-derived rats, 17 beta-estradiol (E2; 5 micrograms/rat) or testosterone (50 micrograms/rat) failed to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation into diaphyses of long bones and that the response to these hormones in terms of increased creatine kinase specific activity was less than half the value in normally fed rats. Two daily ip injections of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3; 0.5 ng/g BW], but not 24,25-(OH)2D3 (5 ng/g BW), partially restored the biological responses to E2 in bone of 21-day-old vitamin D-deficient female rats. Vitamin D deficiency did not impair the responsiveness to gonadal steroids in the epiphysis of long bones, uterus, or prostate, in contrast to its effect on diaphysis. In 21-day-old normally fed female rats, neither vitamin D metabolite enhanced the response to E2. When cultures of rat epiphyseal cells were treated daily for 5 days with either 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1 nM) or 24,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nM), followed by E2 (30 nM) for 24 h, creatine kinase activity was significantly higher than in cultures treated daily for 5 days with vehicle alone, and then with E2. The same treatment of rat embryo calvaria bone cells showed that 1,25-(OH)2D3, but not 24,25-(OH)2D3, significantly increased the creatine kinase activity response to E2. These findings suggest that vitamin D metabolites selectively affect the biological responses of skeletal tissues to gonadal steroids.\r"

In order to determine whether the heterogeneous nature of CRF receptors was inherent in the protein, we examined the glycoprotein nature of both types of CRF receptors using lectin affinity chromatography and treatments with exo- and endoglycosidases. CRF receptors in both the cerebral cortex and anterior pituitary adsorbed to and specifically eluted from Concanavalin-A- and wheat germ agglutinin-immobilized lectin affinity columns, indicating that both forms of the receptor are glycoproteins containing complex and high-mannose carbohydrate moieties. Cerebral cortical CRF receptors were sensitive to both neuraminidase and alpha-mannosidase treatment while pituitary CRF receptors were only affected by neuraminidase treatment, suggesting that CRF receptors in brain and pituitary differed slightly in the nature of their glycosylation units. After treatment of cerebral cortical or anterior pituitary CRF receptors with the endoglycosidase, N-glycanase, the mol wts were markedly decreased; the mol wt of the anterior pituitary CRF receptor was decreased from 75,000 to approximately 40,000-45,000 while in a corresponding manner, the cortical receptor was decreased from 58,000 to approximately 40,000-45,000. Limited proteolysis after deglycosylation with N-glycanase using the proteinases Staphylococcus aureus V8 (S. aureus V8) or papain, generated virtually identical peptide fragments from anterior pituitary- or cerebral cortex- labeled CRF receptor proteins. In summary, these data support the hypothesis that the ligand binding subunit of the CRF receptor in both brain and pituitary resides on a polypeptide of 40,000-45,000 and appears to be identical in both tissues. Differences observed in the mobility of the two proteins were found to be due to differences in the posttranslational modification of the proteins in the two tissues.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of TSH, carbachol (CC), and ATP on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in primary cultures of dog thyroid cells was examined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. TSH caused an increase in [Ca2+]i at 37 C, but not 22 C, while it increased cAMP formation in these cells at both 22 and 37 C. CC and ATP increased [Ca2+]i at both 22 and 37 C. The CC-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was under muscarinic receptor control, and it was biphasic, with an initial spike followed by a sustained increase at a lower level. TSH and ATP were weaker agonists compared to CC, since maximal doses of TSH (100-500 mU/ml) and ATP (100-500 microM) increased [Ca2+]i by 40-70% over basal levels, compared to a 2- to 4-fold increase in [Ca2+] induced by maximal doses of CC (10-50 microM). The TSH-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was transient, returning to basal levels within 1-2 min after application of the agonist. All three agents were able to transiently increase [Ca2+]i to be internal stores. In the presence of the inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers La3+, Ni2+, and Co2+, the peak [Ca2+]i change was little affected, while the persistent response to CC and ATP was blocked, indicating dependence of this phase on influx of Ca2+. Paradoxically, these channel blockers abolished the effect of TSH on [Ca2+]i. TSH stimulation of cAMP formation was also inhibited 80-90% by these blockers, but not in Ca2+-free/EGTA buffer. These results suggest that the Ca2+ channel blockers may have actions in addition to inhibition of Ca2+ entry in these cells. TMB-8 [8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate HCl] specifically blocked both the initial and sustained increase induced by CC, while having no effect on ATP or TSH-induced [Ca2+]i, suggesting that TMB-8 may not be a general antagonist of Ca2+ mobilization. Activators of protein kinase-C, such as phorbol esters or an analog of diacylglycerol, inhibited the [Ca2+]i rise induced by all the three agonists used, indicating a regulatory role of protein kinase-C activation on [Ca2+]i in these cells. In FRTL-5 cells, [Ca2+]i was also increased by TSH and ATP, but not by CC. ATP, however, was a more effective agonist than in dog thyroid cells, while TSH increased [Ca2+]i by a similar magnitude in both cell types. The results of the present study demonstrate that TSH, albeit of lesser potency than CC, increases [Ca2+]i by causing intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in cultured dog thyroid cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bovine follicular fluid (bFF) injected ip in mice during 2 days (65,000 U inhibin/day, 1 U inhibin the activity in 1 micrograms bFF protein) caused a significant decrease in the numbers of A4, intermediate (In), and B spermatogonia to 91%, 74%, and 67% of the control values, respectively. The numbers of undifferentiated spermatogonia remained unchanged. These injections suppressed peripheral FSH levels to 6% of the control values, suggesting that FSH might be the modulator of the effects on spermatogenesis. However, in the Chinese hamster, intratesticular injections of bFF during 4 days (6500 U inhibin/day into one testis) also caused a significant decrease in the numbers of A3. In, B1, and B2 spermatogonia to 86%, 61%, 55%, and 94% of the control values, respectively. Similarly, treatment with a partially purified inhibin preparation from rat Sertoli cell-conditioned medium (rSCCM) during 4 days (Mono Q fraction; 1512 U inhibin/day; 37.8 micrograms protein) caused a significant decrease in the numbers of A3, In, B1, and B2 spermatogonia to 90%, 87%, 66%, and 93% of the control values, respectively. Treatment with a highly purified inhibin preparation from rSCCM during 4 days (30K inhibin; 750 U inhibin/day; 100 ng protein) significantly decreased the numbers of In and B1 spermatogonia to, respectively, 87% and 91% of the control values. These effects were limited to the testis into which the material was injected; the contralateral testis or testes injected with control fluid always showed normal numbers of spermatogonia. This implies that the effects on the seminiferous epithelium are not FSH mediated. Intratesticular injections of bFF or pure inhibin did not affect the number of undifferentiated spermatogonia. However, the Mono Q fraction caused a significant increase in the numbers of undifferentiated spermatogonia in stages IV-VII of the cycle, suggesting the presence of a mitogenic factor for undifferentiated spermatogonia in rSCCM which is not present or is counteracted in bFF. The results suggest that inhibin may have a role in the regulation of spermatogonial development in the adult animal.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the actions and interactions of arginine vasopressin (AVP), angiotensin-II (AII), and oxytocin (OT) on the ACTH secretory response of dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells in a microperifusion system. There was a dose-dependent ACTH secretory response to a 3-min perifusion of AII which reached its maximum 10 sec after the cells were exposed to AII and fell rapidly to baseline within 2 min, despite continued infusion of AII. This brief spike type of pattern is similar to that produced by AVP, but different from the sustained plateau response induced by CRF. The threshold stimulating concentration of AII was about 10(-9) M; the maximally stimulating concentration was not defined, but was 10(-6) M or more. The initial ACTH response to OT was similar, but fell to a plateau 2 min after the cells were exposed to OT and remained constant until perifusion with OT was stopped, after which it fell rapidly to baseline. The threshold stimulating concentration of OT was 10(-8) M; the maximally stimulating concentration was not defined, but was 10(-6) M or more. The ACTH secretory response to 10(-8) M AII was greatly diminished when cells were exposed to 10(-6) AVP or 10(-6) M OT before AII infusion. However, prior exposure to AII had no effect on the magnitude of the ACTH secretory response to either AVP or OT. The effects of simultaneous perifusion of AII and AVP and of AII and OT were additive. When AVP and OT were perifused sequentially, the ACTH secretory response to the peptide that was infused second was completely abolished. Furthermore, the combination of AVP and OT stimulated no greater response than either agent alone. When cells were perifused with the combination of 10(-7) M OT and 10(-7)- to 10(-5)-M concentrations of two potent AVP V1 receptor antagonists, [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid),2-(O-methyl)tyrosine]-Arg8-vasopressin and [1-deaminopenicillamine-2-(O-methyl)tyrosine]-Arg8-vasopressin, both phases of the response to OT were progressively and almost completely inhibited. The initial spike phase was inhibited at lower antagonist concentrations than the sustained plateau phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The potential pathogenic role of angiotensin-II (AII) in early progressive diabetic and renal ablation-induced glomerulosclerosis was explored and compared in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and the mongrel dog. Male SD rats were divided into control and streptozotocin-treated (65 mg/kg, iv) groups. Unilateral surgical nephrectomy (Nx) was performed in half of each group. Enalapril (E; 50 mg/liter in the drinking water) was administered to half of each subgroup. Enalapril (high E; 250 mg/liter) was given to another 13 streptozotocin rats. All diabetic rats were treated with sc NPH insulin (4 U/day), and blood glucose was 520 +/- 124 mg/dl (mean +/- SD). Microalbuminuria was measured by RIA in 24-h urine collections; wet kidney weights were compared. [125I]AII binding assays were performed on isolated glomeruli. In control rats the high affinity binding dissociation constant (Kd) was 0.59 +/- 0.15 nM (n = 26; mean +/- SD) and receptor number (Ro) was 732 +/- 195 fmol/mg glomerular protein. At 3 weeks, the diabetic glomerular AII receptor Kd was 0.38 +/- 0.07 nM (n = 6; P less than 0.02 vs. control) and Ro was 784 +/- 97 fmol/mg protein (P = NS vs. control); diabetic high E Kd was 0.39 +/- 0.06 nM (n = 6; P less than 0.02 vs. control), and Ro was 873 +/- 105 fmol/mg protein (P = NS vs. diabetes without E). By 10 weeks, a Kd of 0.49 +/- 0.12 nM (n = 32; P less than 0.01 vs. control) and a Ro of 780 +/- 174 fmol/mg protein (P = NS vs. control) were observed when all of the diabetic group data were pooled. Neither Nx nor low or high dose E altered Ro. This is evidence that intraglomerular AII levels are normal or reduced after diabetes, Nx, or both. In the diabetic group, low dose E partially prevented, and high E abolished, Nx-enhanced microalbuminuria and renal hypertrophy. In nine pancreatectomized insulin-treated mongrel dogs over a 12- to 24-month period, despite moderately poor glucose control (300 +/- 75 mg/dl) and combined unilateral Nx in five dogs (12 months), elevated microalbuminuria was not observed. [125I]AII binding to isolated normal and diabetic dog glomeruli revealed the Kd to be of low affinity (1.86 +/- 0.28 to 13.80 +/- 1.88 nM), identifying the presence of type B receptors. Hence, the SD rat and mongrel dog differ in susceptibility to glomerular AII receptor type and progressive diabetic glomerulopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Evidence that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) is produced by thecal-interstitial cells (TIC) has suggested the hypothesis that TGF beta may be an autocrine regulator of TIC function. The purpose of these studies is to begin to test this hypothesis. In the present experiments we tested the effects of TGF beta on steroid production by TIC isolated from the ovaries of hypophysectomized immature rats by Percoll gradient centrifugation. When TIC (10(4) viable cells/well) were cultured in serum-free medium (0.2 ml in 96-well plates), low amounts of androsterone (less than 4 ng/ml) were produced at 2, 4, and 6 days. TGF beta (0.01-100 ng/ml) did not change basal androsterone production. Treatment with LH (50 ng/ml) stimulated a 100-fold increase in androsterone at 2 days and 60-fold increases at 4 and 6 days. Concomitant treatment with TGF beta (10 ng/ml) caused a 65% inhibition (ED50 = 2.3 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) of androsterone production at each time period. Analysis of key steroid metabolites demonstrated that androsterone and androstenedione were inhibited equally, while progesterone was significantly increased (ED50 = 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/ml). Time-course studies revealed that TGF beta alone did not alter progesterone production at 2 days, but markedly increased progesterone (10-fold) above control levels at 4 and 6 days. Dose-response experiments showed that TGF beta did not alter the sensitivity of the TIC to LH stimulation, indicating that LH activation of the intracellular signaling pathway was not blocked by TGF beta. Treatment with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) together with LH caused a synergistic increase in androsterone production. The synergistic stimulation of LH action by IGF-I could be blocked by TGF beta. Interestingly, TIC were more sensitive to TGF beta in the presence of IGF-I (ED50 = 0.18 +/- 0.04 ng/ml). In contrast, TGF beta enhanced progesterone production only at the highest dose of TGF beta (10 ng/ml). To further elucidate the mechanism of TGF beta action, the effects of TGF beta on the TIC content of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase (P450(17)alpha) and cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc) were analyzed by immunoblotting. TGF beta alone or in combination with LH stimulated an increase in P450scc content, but did not alter P450(17 alpha content. These results lead us to conclude that 1) the TIC are targets for TGF beta; 2) IGF-I increases the sensitivity of TIC to TGF beta action; and 3) TGF beta acts directly on TIC to stimulate progesterone while inhibiting androgen production.\r"
