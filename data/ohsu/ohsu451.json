  ".W": "The influence of vestibular dysfunction upon the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) in two common peripheral syndromes was investigated by two types of posturographic examination: \"static\" posturography, recording and analyzing the postural sway in stance, and \"kinetic\" posturography, recording the stepping in place test. The influence of the dysfunction was examined outside the attacks, ie, between attacks and not during or immediately after an attack, in patients with Meniere's disease and in others with a sudden vestibular loss syndrome, \"neuronitis.\" However, in both syndromes the influence of the dysfunction was obvious only in some patients; this indicates that central adaptation intervened in the other patients. In this way, central compensation related to the VSR was assessed and compared with compensation for the vestibulo-ocular reflex assessed by the rotation tests. Discordance was shown in a number of cases, ie, a number of cases showed compensation for one reflex, but not for the other. Comparison of the results of both posturographic methods also showed discordance. Normal performance in the walking test could not always be correlated with normal performance in the standing test and vice versa.\r"

Ninety-five percent of the children in one locale and 74.4% in the other had at least one episode during the first year of life. While none of the comparisons were statistically significant, infants at the northernmost community were generally more severely affected; females in each community were found to have 1) fewer and less severe episodes of disease, 2) the first episode at a later age, 3) fewer episodes during the year, and 4) fewer episodes of bilateral disease.\r"

We performed phenotypic studies on two patients with classic localized PaRet (Woringer-Kolopp disease) and one patient with the disseminated type (Ketron-Goodman disease) and compared these with all published reports of cases; both variants show intraepidermal, highly activated, proliferating T cells with variable loss of pan-T-cell antigens, contrasting with nonactivated dermal reactive T cells. This pattern is unique among cutaneous lymphomas and can be used for diagnosis. Despite the fact that localized PaRet does not show a malignant course, recent genotypic analysis of one patient showed monoclonality. Comparable constellations are found in other diseases like lymphomatoid papulosis, which also represent monoclonal disorders of activated T cells with a benign course. To unify these seeming discrepancies, we introduce the concept of \"benign cutaneous lymphomas.\"\r"

  ".W": "The significance of hyperamylasemia and its relationship to pancreatitis after cardiac surgery is controversial. Three hundred consecutive patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were prospectively studied to determine the incidence and significance of postoperative hyperamylasemia. Ninety-six of three hundred patients (32%) developed hyperamylasemia. Fifty-six patients (19%) were classified as having isolated hyperamylasemia because they were asymptomatic and had normal serum lipase. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) had subclinical pancreatitis defined as elevation of serum amylase and lipase or pancreatic isoamylase. Many of these patients had mild gastrointestinal symptoms that were self-limited. Eight patients (2.7%) had overt pancreatitis documented by clinical findings, biochemical abnormalities, and computed tomography (CT) scan or autopsy. Isoamylase analysis demonstrated that isolated hyperamylasemia usually originated from nonpancreatic sources. However, hyperamylasemia occurring in conjunction with abdominal signs and symptoms or elevated serum lipase was almost always pancreatic in origin. Patients with hyperamylasemia had a significantly higher mortality rate (seven of 96 patients, 7.5%) than those with normal serum amylase (two of 204 patients, 0.9%) (p less than 0.01) even when the amylase was nonpancreatic in origin (five of 56 patients, 9%). The reason that nonpancreatic hyperamylasemia is associated with increased postoperative mortality is not established but may represent a variety of metabolic aberrations or tissue injuries. It is concluded that 1) hyperamylasemia after cardiopulmonary bypass is a marker of potential clinical importance, and 2) pancreatitis in this setting is more common than previously recognized and is a potentially lethal complications. Successful treatment depends on early diagnosis and aggressive treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven people with spinal cord injury (SCI) (C4-T6) participated in a program of functional electric stimulation (FES) of their paralyzed leg muscles using the REGYS I system. Individualized protocols consisted of an initial phase of weight lifting, an intermediate phase of ergometer pedalling against 0 Kilopond (kp) alternated with 1/8kp for six two-minute runs separated by two-minute rest periods, and a final phase of 36 sessions of continuous ergometer pedalling against variable resistance. A metabolic analyzer measured exercise stress test parameters before and after each phase while subjects pedalled against incremented resistance. Peak oxygen consumption and total stress test time increased markedly. The respiratory exchange ratio (R=VCO2/VO2) at termination, however, did not differ from unity at any phase, indicating that fatigue (defined as a failure to maintain a pedalling frequency of 35 rpm) occurred when the anaerobic threshold was reached, and that FES exercise can increase the aerobic capacity of persons with SCI. The initial velocity of quadriceps shortening (derived from patellar tendon displacements) also decreased in five of eight subjects tested, suggesting corresponding increases in quadriceps twitch time. Since muscle inactivity converts slow-twitch to fast-twitch fibers, our subjects' increased muscle endurance accompanied by decreased muscle-shortening velocity were compatible with a disproportionate increase in the function of slow-twitch fibers relative to fast-twitch fibers. Although these findings demonstrate that lower extremity FES exercises can safely achieve significant aerobic training effects in patients with SCI, the peak levels of cardiorespiratory performance were similar to those reported for quadriplegic people performing maximal voluntary upper extremity exercises.\r"

By the introduction of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, which has an advantage of fewer side effects compared with the conventional agents, into the regimen, the disease condition was markedly improved in all cases within four months. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim is thus considered as one of the most promising drugs to treat, especially, cytotoxic agent-resistant Wegener's granulomatosis.

The distribution of S100 protein, vimentin and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I) were also studied. The antibody against FXIIIa labelled the normal dermal population of fixed connective tissue cells (dermal dendrocytes) emphasizing their dendritic processes; cells that are widely distributed, but are most numerous in the papillary dermis. In contrast, the antibody, MAC 387 against monocyte derived macrophages, did not label this cell population. In 30 histiocytomas, intense labelling for FXIIIa was found peripherally, but labelling was rather weaker in cells situated centrally. Only a few cells labelled for S100 protein and with the monoclonal antibody MAC 387, but vimentin positivity was universal. UEA-I labelled only vessels in histiocytomas. However, FXIIIa labelling was negative in 16 dermatofibrosarcomas, three keloids and several other fibroproliferative lesions. These contrasting results with FXIIIa labelling have practical implications for diagnosis of benign and malignant spindle cell tumours of the skin. We conclude that histiocytomas (dermal dendrocytomas) take their origin from dermal fixed connective tissue cells, (dermal dendrocytes), but other spindle cell tumours may differ in histogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "On each of 10 patients with untreated plaque psoriasis, two symmetrical plaques were injected with cyclosporin A or placebo on six occasions over 12 days, in a double-blind manner. Biopsies taken from these lesions at 14 days were examined for differences in cellular composition using a double-labelling immunofluorescent technique. The cyclosporin-injected plaques cleared significantly better than those injected with placebo (P less than 0.001). In the epidermis of the cyclosporin-injected plaques, total and HLA-DR+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers were significantly decreased compared to corresponding plaques treated with placebo (total CD4+, total CD8+, DR+ CD4+, P less than 0.01; DR+ CD8+, P less than 0.02). Similarly, T lymphocyte numbers in the dermis were decreased in the cyclosporin compared to placebo-treated plaques; the reduction in total CD4+ and DR+ CD8+ T cell numbers was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). Although total numbers of epidermal dendritic cells were not significantly altered, the DR+CD1- dendritic cell subpopulation was markedly decreased (P less than 0.01) and DR-CD1+ dendritic cells increased (P less than 0.05) in the plaques injected with cyclosporin compared to corresponding placebo-treated plaques. These findings show that cyclosporin injected in situ is effective in clearing psoriasis and probably exerts this beneficial effect by its action on T lymphocytes. A suitable topical preparation that allows penetration of the drug should prove helpful in the treatment of psoriasis.\r"

This procedure permitted lineage assignment in leukemias that otherwise might have been unclassifiable. In addition, the authors demonstrated that the leukemic blasts of 29% of patients with myeloblastic disease exhibited one or more T-cell antigens on their surface. The use of immunophenotyping has greatly enhanced the authors' ability to correctly identify the lineage of acute leukemias. The data, however, must be interpreted with caution with respect to diagnosing acute mixed lineage leukemias and must be integrated with the morphologic and cytochemical evaluation of traditional classification schemes.

PET images were reviewed by two independent readers blinded to clinical data. Subjective defect severity scores were assigned to each myocardial region on a 0 (normal) to 5 (severe) scale. Results were compared with arteriographic stenosis severity expressed as stenosis flow reserve (SFR), with continuous values ranging from 0 (total occlusion) to 5 (normal), calculated from quantitative arteriographic dimensions using automated detection of the vessel borders. There were 115 patients with significant CAD (SFR less than 3), 37 patients with mild CAD (3 less than or equal to SFR less than 4), and 41 patients with essentially normal coronaries (SFR greater than or equal to 4). With increasingly severe impairment of stenosis flow reserve, subjective PET defect severity increased. Despite wide scatter, a PET score of 2 or more was highly predictive of significant flow reserve impairment (SFR less than 3). For each patient, the score of the most severe PET defect correlated with the SFR of that patient's most severe stenosis (rs = 0.77 +/- 0.06). For each of 243 stenoses, PET defect score correlated with the SFR of the corresponding artery (rs = 0.63 +/- 0.08). PET defect location closely matched the region supplied by the diseased artery, and readers agreed whether the most severe PET defect was less than or more than 2 for 89% of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) remains the most frequent life-threatening complication of HIV infection. A retrospective study was undertaken in an attempt to establish the incidence of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in AIDS-related PCP, its mortality, and the impact of adjuvant systemic corticosteroids on its outcome. Of 127 AIDS-related PCP episodes diagnosed at St. Paul's Hospital between Jan 1, 1981, and March 31, 1987, 27 developed ARF (21 percent), and the 24 who consented to ICU admission for ventilatory support were reviewed. All were given IV pentamidine or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or both sequentially. Overall mortality of ARF secondary to AIDS-related PCP was 50 percent. The use of adjuvant systemic corticosteroids was associated with a decreased mortality. Of the 18 patients treated with IV hydrocortisone (400 to 1,000 mg/day in divided doses for the duration of ARF followed by a tapering regimen over 10 to 15 days), seven (39 percent) died, while five of six (84 percent) treated without corticosteroids died (p = 0.05). Survivors received ventilation for 5 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) days and all were discharged from hospital after 20 +/- 4 days. Survivors were also younger (34 +/- 8 vs 43 +/- 10 years, p = 0.034) and presented earlier (14 +/- 3 vs 34 +/- 7 days after onset of symptoms p = 0.017). Known AIDS, previous PCP episodes, and arterial blood gas values at the onset of ARF did not correlate with outcome. We conclude that ARF secondary to AIDS-related PCP merits aggressive management. In particular, younger patients presenting early after the onset of respiratory symptoms appear to have a better prognosis. The decreased mortality associated with the use of adjunctive corticosteroids supports the need for prospective controlled evaluation of this therapeutic modality.\r"

PA production was assayed by culturing rat granulosa cells on [125I]fibrin plates and determining the extent of fibrinolysis after addition of the specific substrate plasminogen. In granulosa cells from preantral follicles of immature rats, treatment with FSH caused dose-dependent increases in PA production whereas glucocorticoids by itself was without effect. Increasing concentrations (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) of both natural and synthetic glucocorticoids potentiated the stimulating effect of FSH on PA production by 120 to 170%. The stimulatory potencies of the natural corticosteroids correlated with the glucocorticoid potencies (cortisol/corticosterone greater than aldosterone/11-deoxycorticosterone). In granulosa cells from Graafian follicles of mature rats, glucocorticoids on its own had direct stimulating effect on PA production. The stimulatory action of glucocorticoids on FSH-dependent PA production was completely blocked by simultaneous treatment with antiglucocorticoid RU 486. Antiserum directed against tissue-type PA (tPA) neutralized the increased fibrinolytic actions of glucocorticoids. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fibrin autography techniques, we showed that the increase in fibrinolytic activity in response to glucocorticoids resulted from increased production of tPA rather than urokinase-like PA. The effect of glucocorticoids on the production of PA inhibitors (PAI) was examined by 1) neutralization of urokinase activity by increasing amounts of culture media from granulosa cells treated with glucocorticoids, 2) reverse fibrin autography, and 3) Western blot analysis with a specific PAI antiserum. All these methods failed to detect a stimulatory action of glucocorticoids, with or without FSH, on PAI production by rat granulosa cells in the culture media. Our data showed that glucocorticoids have a direct stimulating effect on tPA production, but unlike its action on other in vitro systems, they have no significant effect on PAI production by rat granulosa cells in vitro.\r"

A peak effect was seen 60-80 min after injection. The rise in VO2 was prevented by prior injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, and the effect on BAT was abolished by surgical denervation of the sympathetic supply to the tissue. Central injection (cerebroventricular) of a much lower dose (3-8 micrograms/kg) of RU-486 also stimulated VO2, and this effect was inhibited by a CRF receptor antagonist [alpha-helical CRF-(9-41)]. Peripheral injection of RU-486 also elicited acute thermogenic responses in older (greater than 12 months) rats and in genetically obese (Zucker) rats. In lean animals, daily injection of RU-486 inhibited weight gain and stimulated BAT without affecting food intake. The thermogenic effects of RU-486 appear to be due to central stimulation of sympathetic outflow and may involve CRF release. The data support previous studies on the effects of adrenalectomy and CRF on thermogenesis in the rat.\r"

  ".U": "89170496\r", 
  ".W": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a 37-amino acid peptide, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of pancreatic exocrine secretion when administered exogenously The present study was performed to determine if this inhibitory effect is due to the direct actions of exogenous CGRP on the exocrine pancreas or to the effects of another inhibitor released by CGRP. To this end, we first confirmed the inhibitory effects of the peptide on exocrine function by infusing the peptide into conscious rats previously prepared with bile-pancreatic fistulas and measuring cholecystokinin-stimulated amylase and protein outputs. CGRP produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both protein and amylase outputs in vivo. In marked contrast, CGRP in vitro had no direct inhibitory effect on amylase output from either the isolated buffer-perfused pancreas or dispersed acinar cells. Thus, the inhibitory effects of exogenous CGRP on pancreatic exocrine function appear to be indirect. In an attempt to determine the mediator of the inhibitory effects of CGRP, we assessed the ability of similar doses of CGRP to stimulate the release of a potential endogenous inhibitor of pancreatic exocrine function, circulating somatostatin. In conscious rats, iv CGRP dose-dependently increased circulating plasma somatostatin-like immunoreactivity from 35 +/- 5 to 86 +/- 7 fmol/ml. To determine if these increments in circulating somatostatin were sufficient to impair exocrine function, the isolated pancreas was exposed in vitro to a similar concentration of somatostatin. Somatostatin perfusion resulted in a significant inhibition of pancreatic amylase output (73%). Overall, these results support the hypothesis that 1) the inhibitory effect of exogenous CGRP on pancreatic exocrine function is indirect; 2) exogenous CGRP stimulates the release of endogenous somatostatin into the systemic circulation; and 3) the concentration of circulating somatostatin is sufficient to mediate the effect of exogenous CGRP on the exocrine pancreas.\r"

In four trials, the sclerotherapy-treated patients showed an improved long-term survival (follow-up periods longer than a year) when compared with patients in the medical regimen group, whereas in the other three trials, the long-term survival did not differ between the compared groups. Sample sizes in these \"negative\" trials were too small to detect a true moderate effect for serial sclerotherapy. To resolve this controversy, we combined the findings from all trials using a meta-analysis and determined the overall effect of repeated endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy on the survival of patients who had previously bled from esophageal varices. An overall risk difference of -0.15 (95% confidence limits, -0.21 to -0.08; p less than 0.0005) was estimated, indicating that sclerotherapy reduced the number of deaths by 25%. The estimated overall risk difference remained negative even when all patients in the sclerotherapy group with an unknown survival status were pessimistically considered dead at the end of the follow-up period. The results of this quantitative synthesis suggest that patients with bleeding esophageal varices benefit from the inclusion of repeated sclerotherapy in their long-term management regimen.\r"

Capsaicin produced a contraction of this organ that exhibited desensitization, suggesting a specific action on sensory nerves. In preparations preexposed to capsaicin to produce a functional blockade of the capsaicin-sensitive sensory fibers, the contractile response to field stimulation was unaffected as compared with controls. Tachykinins (substance P and neurokinin A) produced a concentration-related contraction of this organ, neurokinin A being more potent than substance P. Spantide, a tachykinin antagonist, markedly inhibited the capsaicin-induced gallbladder contraction, leaving the atropine-sensitive response to field stimulation unaffected. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) produced a concentration-related relaxation, which was tetrodotoxin-resistant, suggesting a direct effect on muscle cells. Repeated administration of CGRP produced desensitization. At this stage, application of capsaicin produced a contractile response much larger than in controls. Both substance P- and CGRP-like immunoreactivity were detected in the guinea pig gallbladder by radioimmunoassay and were significantly reduced after systemic capsaicin desensitization. Capsaicin induced the simultaneous release of substance P- and CGRP-like immunoreactivity from superfused isolated gallbladders. These findings indicate that capsaicin-sensitive nerves in the guinea pig gallbladder can produce a local motor response involving the release of multiple neuropeptides. In the guinea pig gallbladder, tachykinins and CGRP might act as \"physiologic antagonists,\" as observed in other viscera from rats and guinea pigs.\r"

Following 70% hepatectomy, estrogen levels in the blood were elevated, the number of estrogen receptors in the liver was increased and there was an active translocation of estrogen receptors from the cytosol to the nucleus. The injection of tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, inhibits hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy. The administration of 1 microgram tamoxifen per gm body weight at zero time or 6 hr after the operation resulted in a significant inhibition both of DNA synthesis and of the number of cells in mitosis. Injections of tamoxifen 12 hr or later after the operation had no effect. Concomitant injections of equimolar amounts of estrogen abolished the inhibition by tamoxifen. The effects of estrogen and tamoxifen were also tested on hepatocytes in primary culture. Estrogens in the presence of 5% normal rat serum stimulated hepatocyte DNA synthesis as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation and the labeling index, whereas epidermal growth factor-induced DNA synthesis in the absence of normal rat serum was strongly inhibited. Tamoxifen, in contrast, inhibited DNA synthesis of hepatocytes in the presence of 5% normal rat serum and reversed the stimulatory effect of estrogen in the same system. Attempts to elucidate the mechanism of tamoxifen inhibition in vitro indicated that one effect of tamoxifen is to prevent the amiloride-sensitive Na+ influx necessary to initiate hepatocyte proliferation.\r"

The present study compares vascular smooth muscle cells from SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with respect to their proliferative and functional response to growth factors. Specific attention was focused on the interaction of these vascular smooth muscle cells with epidermal growth factor. An increased growth rate of vascular smooth muscle cells from SHR (vs. WKY rats) was observed when cells were cultured in the presence of serum (10% and 0.5%), but not under serum-free conditions. The additional presence of low serum concentrations (0.5%) was required for epidermal growth factor to elicit a proliferative response, whereupon smooth muscle cells from SHR displayed an increased (vs. WKY rats) growth rate. Saturation binding of [125I]epidermal growth factor to intact smooth muscle cells indicated a twofold increase in receptor density in SHR-derived cells (p less than 0.001 vs. WKY rats) without an alteration in affinity for the growth factor. Cells derived from SHR also exhibited greater functional responsiveness to epidermal growth factor when compared with smooth muscle cells from WKY rats as evidenced by amplifications of both S6 kinase activation, phosphoinositide catabolism, elevation of intracellular pH, and DNA synthesis (nuclear labeling). We conclude that increased responsiveness of SHR-derived smooth muscle cells to epidermal growth factor could contribute to alterations in vascular smooth muscle growth and tone that may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Studies on the prognostic significance of blood pressure on cardiovascular disease have essentially investigated the levels of diastolic or systolic blood pressure. However, blood pressure may also be divided into two other components: steady (mean arterial pressure) and pulsatile (pulse arterial pressure). The relations of these two components with cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular mortality were investigated in 18,336 men and 9,351 women aged 40-69 years, who were followed up for a mean period of 9.5 years. However, the interpretation of the relations is complicated by the strong correlation existing between these two components. A principal component analysis was performed to obtain two independent parameters: a steady and a pulsatile component index, strongly correlated with mean and pulse arterial pressure, respectively. In the cross-sectional analysis, relations were stronger with the steady component index than with the pulsatile component index; an association was found between left ventricular hypertrophy and the pulsatile component index in both sexes. The survival analysis was not performed in women under 55 as only 11 cardiovascular deaths occurred in this group. The steady component index was a strong prognostic factor of all types of cardiovascular death in both sexes. In women, the pulsatile component index was positively correlated to death from coronary artery disease and inversely correlated to stroke. In conclusion, the steady component of blood pressure is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular death in both sexes; the pulsatile component could be a risk factor independent of the steady component in women older than 55 years.\r"

Since 1973, the first dose of warfarin has been given on the night of the operation, and the prothrombin time has been maintained between sixteen and eighteen seconds. A pulmonary embolism occurred after fourteen (0.5 per cent) of the 3000 operations. It was never fatal. Bleeding occurred after forty-four operations (1.5 per cent). The effectiveness of the protocol of the University of California at Los Angeles was demonstrated in a large number of patients over a seventeen-year period. Since 1974, the protocol has included closer monitoring of the prothrombin time. After 2595 hip replacements that were done between 1974 and 1987, the rate of pulmonary embolism was 0.2 per cent and the rate of bleeding complications was 1.0 per cent. However, recently a higher incidence of bleeding complications (2.3 per cent) has been noted after non-cemented total hip (stem-type) replacement.\r"

Implantation was technically successful in all cases and there were no major in-hospital complications. During a median follow-up interval of 7 months (range 2 to 26), 10 patients (77%) underwent follow-up angiography. Seven patients remained asymptomatic or in improved condition without further intervention; three patients had further angioplasty with stent implantation for a new stenosis in the same graft. Two patients (20%) developed within-stent restenosis. There was one death from progressive congestive heart failure 7 months after implantation. No patient had a myocardial infarction or needed surgical revascularization during the follow-up period. In selected cases, stent implantation appears to be a promising new technique that may decrease the incidence of restenosis after balloon angioplasty in venous bypass grafts. The rate of complications is low. Further experience and longer follow-up will be needed before definite recommendations can be made about its use.\r"

  ".W": "Human T cell clones contain enzymes that can cleave the substrate N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT). All CTL clones tested in this study secreted BLT-serine esterase activity, whereas only one of three tested non-cytolytic T cell clones secreted this enzymatic activity upon Ag-specific activation. BLT-serine esterase secretion could also be induced by the Fc gamma+ target cell Daudi in the presence of mAb specific for the TCR/CD3 complex, CD2, or the T cell activation Ag Tp 103. In addition, anti-CD3 and a mitogenic combination of anti-CD2 mAb, induced secretion of BLT-serine esterase in the absence of target cells, whereas anti-Tp 103 failed to do so. The secreted BLT-serine esterase activity induced by the various ligands was inhibited by the serine esterase inhibitors PMSF and m-ABA, but not by N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone. Significant BLT-serine esterase activity was induced by target cells or soluble anti-CD3 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ ions, provided that extracellular Mg2+ ions were present. The cytotoxic activities by the human CTL clones were completely blocked under these conditions. All ligands that induced BLT-serine esterase secretion in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, induced a transient rise of intracellular Ca2+. Soluble anti-CD3 mAb did not induce a transient rise in intracellular Ca2+ or secretion of BLT serine esterase in CTL preincubated for 2 h with 5 mM EGTA. These findings indicate that mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in human CTL clones is required for induction of secretion of BLT-serine esterase.\r"

  ".W": "The mAb F23.1, specific for V beta 8-related determinants on the TCR, was used to study the requirements for TCR cross-linking and for accessory cells (AC) in the induction of proliferation or IL-2 responsiveness in L3T4+ (CD4+) and Lyt-2+ (CD8+) T cells. T cells were exposed in vitro to soluble native F23.1 antibody, to heteroconjugates composed of the Fab fragments of F23.1 linked to Fab fragments of antibodies specific for Ia determinants on AC, or to F23.1 immobilized on an insoluble matrix. Soluble F23.1 antibody-induced proliferation in naive T cells only in the presence of both AC and exogenous IL-2, and these responses were confined to Lyt-2+ T cells. In contrast, heteroconjugates capable of crosslinking F23.1+ TCR to AC surface Ia determinants were capable of inducing proliferation in both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ T cells in the absence of added lymphokine. Moreover, binding to and presumably multi-valent crosslinking of the TCR by immobilized F23.1 was sufficient to induce proliferation in both Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ T cells in the absence of AC or exogenous IL-2. Further, it was found that the conditions necessary for T cell growth factor secretion paralleled closely those required for induction of T cell proliferation in the absence of added lymphokine, suggesting that production of endogenous lymphokine might be the limiting process for triggering of T cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings suggest that under optimal conditions of TCR cross-linking, TCR occupancy and cross-linking is sufficient to deliver all of the signals necessary to initiate proliferation in naive populations of both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ T cells. However, when conditions for TCR signaling are suboptimal, as may be the case for normal Ag-mediated stimulation, a role for second signals delivered by AC or exogenous lymphokines can become critical for T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the role of IL-1 on the activation of CD8+/CD4- class I-restricted helper cell-independent cytolytic T cell (HITc) clones known to produce IL-2 and proliferate in vitro after Ag stimulation with a Friend retrovirus-induced leukemia (FBL). The functional role of IL-1 in Ag-specific proliferation and IL-2 secretion was assessed by stimulating the T cell clones with FBL either in the presence or absence of macrophages (M phi), rIL-1, or rIL-2. Resting cloned HITc cells, purified from residual accessory cells, failed to proliferate in response to FBL alone, but proliferated in response to FBL plus M phi, rIL-1 or rIL-2. Stimulation with FBL alone in the absence of M phi or IL-1 was sufficient for induction of IL-2R expression, and rendered cells responsive to IL-2, but M phi or IL-1 were also required to induce production of IL-2. The activity of IL-1 was further examined by measuring the binding of [125I]rIL-1 alpha, which demonstrated that resting cloned HITc cells expressed IL-1R that increased in number after activation with Ag. This expression of IL-1R and requirement for IL-1 by CD8+ HITc was surprising because previous studies examining T cell populations after mitogen stimulation have not detected IL-1R on the CD8+ population. Therefore, the role of IL-1 in the activation of CD8+ CTL that do not secrete IL-2 after activation was assessed. By contrast to HITc, CD8+ CTL required exogenous IL-2 to proliferate in vitro and did not express IL-1R. These data demonstrate that the subset of CD8+ T cells responsible for IL-2 production express IL-1R and that triggering this receptor with IL-1 after Ag stimulation results in the production of IL-2 and subsequent proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "The function of the CD8 molecule in lympholysis mediated by cytotoxic T cells was investigated by examining possible contributions of ligands on the target cell to the inhibition of lysis observed with CD8-specific mAb. In order to evaluate a variety of target cells, including those not expressing the nominal Ag (NA) for which the CTL was specific, lysis was effected by cross-linking the CTL and the target cells with anti-CD3 mAb. Such CD3 redirected cytotoxicity was demonstrated to be inhibited by anti-CD8 mAb when low anti-CD3 mAb concentrations were used. The possibility that inhibition by anti-CD8 mAb resulted for competition for the FcR between the anti-CD3 mAb and anti-CD8 mAb was eliminated by targeting TNP-modified cells with an antibody heteroconjugate prepared from Fab fragments of anti-CD3 and anti-DNP antibodies. Inhibition of the lysis of target cells not expressing NA including those deficient in class I expression, demonstrated that neither NA nor class I expression was required for anti-CD8 mAb inhibition. Whether the anti-CD8 mAb inhibition required CD8 Ag interaction with any ligand on the target cell was further investigated by measuring exocytosis of enzyme granule from CTL activated with CD3-coated poly-styrene beads. CD8-specific mAb inhibited such CTL activation in this target cell-free system. A CD8(+), MHC class II-specific CTL clone, was used to show differential inhibition by anti-CD8 mAb, depending on the target cell, therefore providing evidence that anti-CD8 mAb binding does not generate an absolute off signal. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that anti-CD8 mAb affect the lytic process independent of the recognition of a ligand on the target cell by CD8.\r"

  ".U": "89176230\r", 
  ".W": "The nature of CR type 2 (CR2)-ligand interactions which leads to the activation of human B cells was analyzed by using synthetic peptides and CR2-positive cell lines. The third component of C (C3) supported the growth of human lymphoblastoid B cells in serum-free medium containing human transferrin. This effect was inhibited by an antibody to C3d (mAb 130) which specifically inhibits C3d binding to CR2, but not by other anti-C3 mAb. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the CR2-binding site on C3d, P28 (residues 1187-1214) or multivalent P13 [1202-1214)4-template), supported the proliferative response of CR2-positive human lymphoblastoid lines in a similar way as C3 and this response could be inhibited by the anti-CR2 mAb OKB7. The proliferative response to C3 or peptides was dose dependent and a 60-fold higher concentration of P28 peptide was required to induce the same level of proliferation as C3. This stimulation of growth was observed only on CR2 expressing cell lines Raji and Daudi, and not on the CR2-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line Rael and the monocytic cell line U937. In contrast to the stimulatory effect of P28 and P13-template, monomeric P14 (1201-1214) was not able to support the growth of these cell lines. This peptide, however, inhibited the proliferative response of the CR2-positive lines to C3, P28, and multivalent-P13, thus indicating that cross-linking of the CR2 receptor is necessary for B cell proliferation. Another peptide, E12 (from glycoprotein (GP)350, the major EBV outer membrane GP) which shows a high degree of similarity with P14, also inhibited the proliferative response of Raji cells, suggesting that this segment on GP350 is involved in the interaction of EBV with CR2. The possibility of using the above peptides as well as other peptides with \"tailor-made\" structure in studying the multifunctional role of C3 is discussed.\r"

Recently CD8-positive cells have been shown to release a soluble form of the CD8 Ag. We have devised a sandwich monoclonal enzyme immunoassay for the quantitation of this released CD8. Soluble CD8 was released in response to lymphocyte activation. In vitro, PHA or anti-CD3 mAb-mediated T cell activation led to release of CD8 into the culture supernatant. In vivo, serum from patients with EBV-induced infectious mononucleosis (IM), a disease associated with intense CD8+ T cell activation, demonstrated elevations in soluble CD8 (7939 U/ml, day 0) compared to serum from normal controls (289 U/ml). Levels of soluble CD8 correlated (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001) with the increased percentage of CD8+/HLA-DR+ (activated CD8+ T cells) observed in acute IM. Sequential analysis of serum during the course of IM shows that soluble CD8 levels parallel the decline in CD8+/HLA-DR+ cells that occurs with the resolution of the disease. These data suggest that released CD8 may be of value in monitoring the involvement of CD8+ T cells in response to a pathologic event. The functional role of the released CD8 molecule will require further investigation.\r"

Reduction of disulfide bonds and alkylation in denaturing buffer (8 M urea) destroyed the inhibitory activity of sCD4, whereas reduction and alkylation in PBS had no effect. Derivatization or digestion of carbohydrate groups by periodate oxidation or by glycolytic enzyme digestion did not affect sCD4 inhibitory capacity. Digestion with trypsin or endoproteinase Glu-C destroyed activity. A limited digestion of sCD4 with endoproteinase Glu-C resulted in a mixture of fragments, however, and the mixture had inhibitory activity equivalent to that of intact sCD4. Within this mixture, a fragment of 23 kDa was identified that binds to HIV. Although sCD4 can be digested to yield fully active fragments, the requirement for intrachain disulfide bonding indicates that the minimum sized portion of CD4 that will retain full affinity for HIV will have to be formulated with a proper tertiary structure.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) infection on the function and the phenotype of a human proliferating/cytotoxic T cell clone, specific for tetanus toxin, was investigated. During the period after infection, two distinct phases were observed, based on growth properties, phenotype, and functional activity of the infected cells. Phase I HTLV-I infected cells (0 to about 150 days after infection) proliferated in an IL-2-dependent way, but without the requirement for repetitive antigenic stimulation. No differences in expression of the CD2, CD3, CD4, Tp103, and CD28 Ag between these cells and the parental cells could be demonstrated, with the exception of the expression of IL-R p55 and HLA-DR Ag, which were constitutively expressed on the phase I cells. The phase I HTLV-I-infected cells, as well as the parental 827 cells reacted with a mAb specific for an epitope on the variable part of the TCR beta-chain, indicating that the TCR was not altered after HTLV-I infection. Like the parental clone, the phase I cells proliferated in response to tetanus toxin, but the tetanus toxin-specific response of the phase I cells did not require the presence of APC. Results of experiments, in which the levels of intracellular Ca2+ were measured, indicated that HTLV-I cells can acquire the capability to process Ag and present that to themselves. Phase I HTLV-I-infected T cells had lost their cytotoxic activity which was likely to be due to an effect on the lytic machinery rather than on Ag recognition by the TCR, inasmuch as it was found that phase I HTLV-I-infected T cells did no longer contain N-alpha-benzyloxy-L-lysine thiobenzylester-serine esterase activity. Furthermore, it was found that phase I HTLV-I-infected T cells had a diminished capacity to form conjugates with target cells. From a period of about 200 days after HTLV-I infection, phase II cells emerged that proliferated strongly in the absence of IL-2 and that had lost all functional activity. These cells did not express the CD3/T cell receptor complex on their surface. Phase I as well as phase II HTLV-I-infected cells were targets for CTL raised in the autologous donor.\r"

This mAb reacted with both various B and T cell lines such as HSB2 cells, with an NK-like cell line YT-C3 cells, and with human fibroblast MCR-5 cells. It also reacted with normal resting peripheral B lymphocytes, monocytes, and anti-CD2- or anti-CD3-activated T lymphocytes. The 4.9 mAb immunoprecipitated two bands estimated to be of Mr 68 and 75 kDa from iodinated 3B6 cells. The 4.9 mAb inhibited the proliferation of peripheral T lymphocytes induced either by anti-CD3 mAb or anti-CD2 mAb. The 4.9 mAb inhibited also the proliferation of murine thymocytes both in the presence of PHA and IL-1 and the proliferation of human fibroblasts in the presence of IL-1. Radiolabeled IL-1 binding on 3B6 cells revealed two types of IL-1 binding sites with high and low affinity for IL-1 (300 sites/cell with a Kd of 6 x 10(-11)M and 6000 sites/cell with a Kd of 3 x 10(-9)M). On both 3B6 and YT-C3 cells, mAb 4.9 inhibited specifically the binding of 125I-labeled rIL-1, alpha or beta, whereas the irrelevant IgM mAb did not. Conversely, rIL-1, alpha or beta, could inhibit specifically the binding of radioiodinated 4.9 mAb to 3B6 or YT-C3 cells, whereas rIL-2, rIFN, or the irrelevant IgM mAb were ineffective. 125I-4.9 mAb bound 3B6 cells with an association constant (Ka) of 2 x 10(8)/M and demonstrated 6000 binding sites/cell. We thus conclude that mAb 4.9 recognizes a protein complex (68 to 75 kDa) closely associated with the IL-1R.\r"

  ".W": "The cloning, sequencing, expression, and biologic activities of rabbit IL-1 alpha and beta are described. A cDNA library was constructed in lambda gt10 by using polyadenylated RNA extracted from rabbit adherent splenic macrophages 4 h after stimulation with endotoxin. By using the cDNA for human IL-1 beta and IL-1 alpha as hybridization probes, cDNA for both forms of rabbit IL-1 were isolated. The cDNA for rabbit IL-1 beta encodes a precursor polypeptide of 268 amino acids with an overall homology to human IL-1 beta of 74% (81% in the mature region coding for a 17.5 kDa carboxyl-terminal protein). The similarity between the two rabbit IL-1 forms is 31% for the entire molecule and 34% for the mature protein. The mature polypeptides of both forms were expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity and tested in a variety of biologic assays. Both forms produced typical endogenous pyrogen fevers in rabbits and augmented murine thymocyte and Th cell proliferation. Rabbit IL-1 alpha and beta were more pyrogenic in rabbits than human rIL-1 beta, whereas human rIL-1 alpha and beta were slightly more potent lymphocyte-activating factors. The recombinant rabbit proteins induced PGE and IL-1 production from human PBMC in vitro. A RIA for human IL-1 alpha did not recognize rabbit IL-1 alpha or beta, but rabbit IL-1 beta cross-reacted (as much as 30%) in a RIA for human IL-1 beta. Rabbits were injected with endotoxin and mRNA for both forms of IL-1 were observed primarily in the spleen and liver. The mRNA reached maximal levels after 60 min, then declined rapidly over the next 3 h, but were still present after 24 h. Liver tissue removed 4 h after endotoxin infusion produced lymphocyte-activating factors which were neutralized by more than 90% with a combination of goat anti-rabbit IL-1 alpha and anti-IL-1 beta.\r"

The circulating levels of this cytokine in man in response to bacterial LPS (endotoxin) were studied. A single i.v. bolus of endotoxin (20 U/kg) produced a monophasic rise in circulating immunoreactive IFN-beta 2/IL-6 and IFN-beta 2/IL-6 bioactivity (hepatocyte stimulation and B cell differentiation assays) peaking 2 to 4 h after the endotoxin challenge. Peak IFN-beta 2/IL-6 levels ranged from 4.1 to 27.5 ng/ml. Associated with this was a rise in circulating C-reactive protein levels detected 20 h after the endotoxin bolus. Thus, IFN-beta 2/IL-6 is likely one of the endogenous mediators which is triggered in man during bacterial infection and likely participates in the metabolic and immune responses of the infected host.\r"

The increase is shown to derive from myeloid precursors undergoing repeated cell divisions prior to definitive lineage restriction. The response, which occurs in the absence of any pre-formed feeder layer, depends on dual stimulation by both IL-1 and IL-3, and the maximum effect depends on the presence of both factors together from the initiation of the cultures. The observations extend the known range of targets of IL-1 and IL-3 to include primitive pluripotential precursors capable of some degree of self-renewal, and provide a specific and relatively simple assay both for the precursors and the soluble factors which regulate them.\r"

  ".W": "Addition of anti-CD3 mAb 147 (IgG1), 446 (IgG1), or 454 (IgG2a) to cultures of T plus non-T cells can result in both B cell growth and differentiation. To determine whether lymphokines mediating these activities were similar to those described from conventional mitogen-induced T cell activation, normal peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb for 48 h. The supernatants were assayed for factors inducing B cell growth or differentiation (BCDF). A marked increase in Ig secretion was observed when either EBV-transformed B cell lines or normal B cells, pre-activated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain, were cultured in the presence of mAb 446 (anti-CD3) stimulated T cell supernatant whereas no significant increase in Ig secretion was noted with either mAb 454- or 147-induced T cell supernatant despite equivalent T cell proliferative responses to these antibodies. In contrast, IL-2 secretion was detectable in T cell supernatants from T cells stimulated with either mAb 454 or 147 but not 446. Factors promoting B cell proliferation were detected in all antibody-stimulated T cell supernatants but, contrary to BCDF, appear to act only on non-activated B cells. To determine whether these effector activities were due to distinct lymphokines, supernatants were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Superose 12 permeation chromatography revealed BCDF activity with an apparent Mr of approximately 30,000 Da. The growth factor activity eluted over a wider and higher molecular weight range which overlapped the differentiation factor activity. Fractions containing BCDF activity were pooled, dialyzed, applied to a Mono Q anion-exchange column, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. The growth factor activity came off in a single-peak while BCDF was found divided into two major areas. The growth factor eluted at an ionic strength between the two BCDF activities. BCDF has an apparent isoelectric point (pI) of 6, in contrast to the reported pI 5 for IL-6 and more acidic than the documented basic pI of IFN-gamma. Lastly, peaks with BCDF activity were not active in assays for either IL-2 or IL-4. In addition, a rabbit anti-IL-6 heteroantiserum failed to inhibit the pI 6 BCDF, suggesting non-identity between IL-6 and anti-CD3 induced BCDF. Thus, anti-CD3 activated T cells generate both growth factor activity and BCDF as separate molecular entities distinct from IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and conventional IL-6.\r"

  ".W": "Immune complexes were prepared by incubation of human IgG paraproteins with F(ab')2 fragments of the mAb K35 against the kappa-L chain of human IgG. The composition of these complexes was analyzed by centrifugation over sucrose gradients, by gel filtration, by RIA with either IgG Sepharose or K35 Sepharose and by double-labeling studies. The results indicated that the complexes consist of saturated tetramers composed of two IgG molecules cross-linked by two F(ab')2 fragments of the mAb. These complexes were used to study the binding of the different IgG subclasses to human neutrophils at 4 degrees C. Human neutrophils bound IgG3 complexes approximately three times faster than IgG1 complexes. Binding of IgG2 or IgG4 dimers to the neutrophils was undetectable. The same number of IgG1 complexes and IgG3 complexes bound to the neutrophils, but considerable inter-donor variation was found (mean number of Fc gamma R per neutrophil: 190,000, range 120,000 to 400,000). The Ka for the binding of IgG1 complexes to neutrophils (median 11 x 10(7) M-1) was lower than the Ka for the binding of IgG3 complexes (median 47 x 10(7) M-1). Competition studies between labeled IgG1 complexes or IgG3 complexes and unlabeled complexes showed that the Fc gamma R of human neutrophils do not display an IgG subclass specificity. Incubation of neutrophils with a mAb against the FcRIII completely blocked the binding of IgG1 complexes and IgG3 complexes. Incubation with a mAb against the FcRII reduced the affinity of the complexes for the neutrophils but had no effect on the maximum number of complexes bound. This indicates that one complex may bind simultaneously to one FcRIII and to one FcRII.\r"

  ".U": "89176258\r", 
  ".W": "We have identified a late, committed stage in the differentiation of the mast cell progenitor just before granulation. Mast cell committed progenitors (MCCP) are nongranulated cells with a density of 1.060 to 1.070 g/ml which can be harvested from the mesenteric lymph node of mice infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Mast cell-committed progenitors are able to proliferate and differentiate in the absence of IL-3 or IL-4 when cultured on a monolayer of embryonic skin or 3T3 fibroblasts and can form colonies in methylcellulose supplemented with fibroblast conditioned medium. Fibroblast conditioned medium appears to contain a soluble MCCP proliferation factor that maintains biologic activity when heated to 56 degrees C for 45 min but is destroyed by incubation with either trypsin or chymotrypsin. It can be selectively precipitated with 60 to 70% saturated ammonium sulfate. The factor is not absorbed by immobilized antibodies to nerve growth factor. The MCCP proliferation activity of the factor could not be mimicked by IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, granulocyte-CSF, macrophage-CSF, IFN-alpha/beta, IFN-gamma, nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, serum fibronectin, heparin, or a number of glycosaminoglycans. At high salt concentrations, the factor passes through a 50-kDa membrane and can be concentrated above a 5-kDa membrane. MCCP acquire a connective tissue phenotype when cultured on a fibroblast monolayer and a mucosal phenotype when cloned in the presence of conditioned medium from PWM-stimulated spleen cells. When cultured in the absence of IL-3 on a monolayer of embryonic skin or 3T3 fibroblasts, mast cell-committed progenitors produce mast cells which stain with berberine sulfate suggesting a connective tissue phenotype; however, the mast cells that develop when mast cell-committed progenitors are cultured in the presence of IL-3 or conditioned media from PWM-stimulated spleen cells do not stain with berberine sulfate. MCCP intercalate into monolayers of embryonic skin or 3T3 fibroblasts, but T cells are not able to associate with the monolayer and can be completely washed away. Attempts to enrich mast cell-committed progenitors by intercalation and elution from embryonic skin monolayers proved unsuccessful, but some enrichment of mast cell-committed progenitors could be achieved by discontinuous Percoll gradients. Thus, we have identified a way to obtain late-stage, mast cell-committed progenitors in an environment that is virtually uncontaminated with other hematopoietic progenitors.\r"

  ".W": "The protein tyrosine kinase p56lck is implicated in the control of lymphocyte growth by virtue of its overexpression in some lymphoid malignancies and its transforming activity in heterologous systems. Previous studies have demonstrated that levels of lck mRNA and of p56lck decline rapidly after T cell activation. The disappearance of p56lck results primarily from post-translational conversion of p56lck to more slowly migrating forms with apparent sizes of approximately 60 kDa. This modification can be provoked by treatment of lymphocytes with PMA, and has been associated with increased serine phosphorylation of the p56lck molecule. Here we demonstrate that conversion of p56lck to p60lck is a feature of the physiologic activation of T lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells. In addition, we show that the PMA-induced modification of p56lck proceeds via a mechanism distinct from conventional protein kinase C activation. The rapid conversion of p56lck to p60lck after antigenic stimulation is consistent with the view that this membrane-associated protein tyrosine kinase regulates some aspects of the lymphocyte activation sequence.\r"

Here a series of conjugates were made with the diphtheria protein CRM197 and with uniterminally coupled OS haptens that varied in chain length, exposed terminal residue, or multiplicity of loading as defined by ribose/protein ratio. Adults were given a single injection, 1-yr-old infants were given a two-injection sequence, and capsular polysaccharide of H. influenzae type b antibody responses were assessed by radioantigen binding. Vaccines C-4r, C-6r, and C-12r, in which ribitol-ended OS of mean length 4, 6, or 12 repeat units were coupled at low hapten loading, were about equally immunogenic (geometric means 2 to 5 micrograms/ml in infants, 5 to 9 micrograms/ml in adults). Vaccine C7p was made with a higher loading of OS having mean length 7 repeat units and having mainly phosphate monoester at the exposed termini Vaccine C-7R was made from a portion of C-7p by enzymatic removal of most of the terminal phosphates. Compared to the C-4r, C-6r, and C-12r series, vaccines C-7p and C-7R induced geometric means about 10-fold higher in adults and 20-fold higher in infants. Thus OS chain length (in the range studied) and exposed terminus are less critical variables in this system than the extent of hapten loading.\r"

To examine the CTL response to the influenza virus A/Ty/Ont/7732/66[H5N9], particularly the H5 hemagglutinin, a long term CTL line was generated from spleen cells of A/Ty/Ont-immune Balb/c [H-2d] mice secondarily stimulated in vitro with A/Ty/Cal/Hurst-2/71[H5N2]. This CTL line was highly specific for influenza viruses of the H5 subtype. From this line, clones were isolated by limiting dilution and shown to be H5 hemagglutinin-specific based on recognition of an H5 vaccinia virus recombinant (H5 Vac). The clones exhibited the classical CTL surface phenotype Lyt-1-2+L3T4-; however, unlike the typically class I-restricted Lyt-2+ CTL, they were restricted in antigen recognition by class II (I-E) MHC molecules based on target cell recognition and antibody blocking of cytotoxicity. The clones recognized both infectious and non-infectious A/Ty/Ont presented by class II+ target cells. In adoptive transfer studies to assess the biologic role of the clones in vivo, these class II-restricted clones did not appear to alter mortality. However, these cells significantly reduced both morbidity and virus titers in the lungs of infected animals at 5 days post-infection. Thus, in the immune response to this virus, class II-restricted Lyt-2+ CTL specific for the H5 hemagglutinin were readily generated and their biologic role in vivo involved viral clearance.\r"

These genes span approximately 14 kb on chromosome 6 and consist of six exons and five introns. The exons correlate roughly with the putative functional domains, namely, a leader exon, a variable and joining region-like exon, a hinge region-like exon, a transmembrane exon, and two intracytoplasmic exons. There is no intervening sequence between V- and J-like gene segments, indicating that rearrangement is not necessary for the expression of the Ly-3 gene. In the 5'-flanking region there is no \"TATA\" box nor \"CAAT\" box; however, three \"GC\" boxes are located upstream of the ATG initiator codon. There are short stretches of sequence homologous to 5'-flanking sequences of the Ly-2 gene. In addition, the sequences CTCTGTGGCA at -748 exhibits homology to the enhancer core sequence of the human Ig H chain and TCR genes. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the extracellular portion between Ly-3.1 and Ly-3.2 revealed a single base difference which results in an amino acid substitution. Therefore it is likely that this amino acid difference is responsible for the previously defined Ly-3 allotypes.\r"

This structurally unique phosphoprotein plays a role in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and differentiation. In this report genomic DNA clones containing the human CD20 gene were isolated and the structure of the CD20 gene determined. Southern blot analysis revealed that CD20 mRNA was transcribed from a single-copy gene. The CD20 gene was 16 kb long and was composed of eight exons. The first exon marked the major transcription initiation site as determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease analysis. The translation initiation codon was located within the third exon. Exon VIII encoded the COOH terminus of the CD20 protein and the long 3' untranslated region. Three forms of CD20 mRNA were identified that all encode an identical protein product. The dominant form of 2.8 kb results from usage of exons I through VIII, whereas a second form that is 263 bp shorter had exon I spliced into an internal 3' splice site within exon III thereby skipping exon II. A minor 3.4-kb mRNA species most likely results from an uncharacterized upstream exon(s) splicing into an internal 3' slice site located in exon I. Nucleotide sequences of cDNA clones representative of each of these RNA forms are presented. The 5' splice site following exon V was found to be divergent from the consensus splice sequence. A relationship between the individual peptides encoded by the six exons and structurally distinct regions of the CD20 protein is likely.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of regulation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 glycoprotein D (gD-1) gene expression on HSV-specific immune response and protection from cutaneous HSV-2 disease was studied using vaccinia virus recombinants containing gD-1 under the control of early (VP176) or late (VP254) vaccinia virus promoters. Expression of gD-1 in VP176-infected cells was first observed at 2 h after infection. It did not depend on viral DNA replication. In VP254-infected cells, gD-1 was first observed at 24 h after infection and its expression depended on DNA replication. Immunized guinea pigs had similar titers of HSV-specific neutralizing antibody. However, HSV-specific T cell responses were significantly higher in VP176- than in VP254-immunized animals as determined by lymphoproliferation (P less than .005) and delayed type hypersensitivity (P less than .01). The reduced T cell responses of VP254-immunized guinea pigs correlated with poor gD-1 expression in VP254-infected antigen presenting cells (splenic adherent and epidermal cells). Immunization with VP176, but not with VP254, protected guinea pigs from primary (P less than .0005) and recurrent (P less than .0005) cutaneous HSV-2 lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Von Willebrand factor (vWf) is an adhesive glycoprotein composed of identical subunits linked by disulfide bonds to form multimers of varying sizes. VWf is found in platelets and plasma, where it functions in the adhesion of platelets to exposed subendothelium. Subendothelial matrix contains vWf, but the multimeric composition of matrix vWf, its binding site in matrix, and the mechanism by which it is delivered to matrix are unknown. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVE) cultures, we have partially characterized subendothelial matrix vWf. Matrix from HUVE was solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate and electrophoresed on 1.25% agarose gels. The extracted vWf was composed of extremely high molecular weight (HMW) multimers of vWf not normally found in plasma. The vWf content of HUVE supernatant, extract, and matrix was quantitated and characterized by radioimmunoassay, agarose gel electrophoresis, and densitometry. The matrix-bound or -associated vWf represented 4% to 18% of total HUVE vWf. Western blot analysis of matrix vWf after reduction showed a subunit species of 220 kd. Long-term incubation of HUVE with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a compound that causes release of HMW vWf from Weibel-Palade bodies in HUVE, resulted in a marked decrease in matrix vWf (0.2% to 1% of the total vWf). The multimeric pattern of the remaining matrix vWf continued to show predominantly HMW multimers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eligibility criteria included age greater than 18 years, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performance status 0 to 2, lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 15,000 cells/microL, international stage B or C disease (multiple lymph nodes involved and/or hemoglobin [Hgb] less than 11 g and/or platelets less than 100,000/microL) and no more than one prior treatment regimen. DCF dose was 4 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) weekly for 3 weeks and then every 2 weeks. There were 39 eligible patients (35 men and four women; median age, 63 years; median time from diagnosis to study entry, 3 years). Of these 39 patients, 31% were stage B and 33% had no prior treatment. Median laboratory values at entry were Hgb 10.5 g, WBC 96,100/microL, and platelets 93,500/microL. Nodal involvement was present in 90%, splenomegaly in 81%, and hepatomegaly in 47%. Patients received a median of nine DCF injections, with a range of four to 26. Three patients were not evaluable for response. Overall, 3% achieved a complete response (CR), 23% a partial response (PR), 28% showed clinical improvement (CI), and 38% had stable disease (SD). Associated toxicities (grade 2 or worse) observed were infections (52%), worsening of thrombocytopenia (26%) or anemia (33%), nausea and vomiting (31%), rash or pruritis (20%), and stomatitis (8%). We conclude that DCF is an active agent in CLL with acceptable toxicity.\r"

Nine of the ten responding patients had metastatic disease that had objectively progressed on previous chemotherapy with a FUra-containing regimen. This program was well tolerated, with toxicities consisting mainly of stomatitis and granulocytopenia. These results suggest that augmentation of the reduced folate levels of metastatic breast carcinomas may enhance the effectiveness of the fluoropyrimidines in this disease.\r"

  ".U": "89177430\r", 
  ".W": "In a phase II study, patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with simultaneous chemoradiotherapy. Treatment was divided into three courses. Chemotherapy consisted of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin [cis-DDP]) 60 mg/m2 intravenously (IV), fluorouracil (5-FUra) 350 mg/m2 IV, and folinic acid (leucovorin calcium [FA]) 50 mg/m2 IV on day 2 as bolus, and 5-FUra 350 mg/m2 over 24 hours and FA 100 mg/m2 over 24 hours on days 2 through 5. Radiotherapy consisted of 23.4 Gy over nine days divided into 13 fractions of 1.8 Gy each delivered twice a day from day 3 through day 11. This regimen was repeated on days 22 and 44. Total radiation dose amounted to 70.2 Gy over 51 days. Between August 1984 and October 1986, 62 (modified AJCC stage III, four; IV A, eight; IV B, 50) consecutive patients were entered in the study. Three patients died during treatment due to tumor hemorrhage. Of 59 patients, 48 (81%) achieved a clinically complete response (cCR); 11 (19%) achieved a partial response (cPR). Mean follow-up of the surviving patients was 29+ (24 to 44) months. Actuarial 2-year survival probability is 52%, including three early deaths from tumor bleeding. Tumor and neck nodes control rates at 2 years were 92% for stage III and IV A patients and 65% for stage IV B patients. Patients with cCR had a significantly better 2-year tumor and neck nodes control probability compared with patients who achieved cPR after therapy (P less than .001). Six patients developed distant metastases. Overall toxicity was tolerable, mucositis particularly was not a limiting factor.\r"

  ".W": "Although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion. We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5-FU infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes. Patients were monitored for 23 +/- 4 hours before 5-FU infusion, and 98 +/- 9 hours during 5-FU infusion. Anginal episodes were rare: only one patient had angina (during 5-FU infusion). However, asymptomatic ST changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had ST changes before 5-FU infusion v 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P less than .002). The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to 5-FU infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-FU v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P less than .01). ECG changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease. There were two cases of sudden death, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course. We conclude that 5-FU infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of ischemia, particularly among patients with coronary artery disease. The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined.\r"

The results of SCS in these patients at the end of the test period and at the latest follow-up examination are analyzed in relation to the etiology of their pain. In 40 patients pain was associated with an obstructive peripheral vasculopathy, in 10 with a previous herpes zoster infection, in 15 with an incomplete traumatic spinal cord lesion, in nine with root and/or nerve damage, in 11 with cancer, and in 19 with previous back surgery. The etiology of the pain in five patients was uncertain. This experience supports the conclusion that the best indications for SCS are vasculopathic pain and post-herpetic neuralgia. No clinical usefulness was found for SCS in cancer pain or in central deafferentation types of pain.\r"

Lymphadenitis, lung infections, dermatitis, enteral infections, and hepatic abscesses were the most frequent infections. Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, and Aspergillus were the main microorganisms encountered. Twelve patients died: five from lung aspergillosis, three from hepatic abscesses, two from pneumonopathy of unknown origin, one from salmonellosis, and one from another probable infection that could not be proved. The actuarial survival rate was 50% at 10 years of age, with a prolonged plateau thereafter. There was no difference in survival rates between patients with X-linked and those with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease. The 8-year actuarial survival rate was significantly higher for patients born in 1978 or afterward than for patients born before 1978 (92.9% vs 70.5%). A retrospective analysis of the occurrence of bacterial and fungal infections in patients who received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ketoconazole as infection prophylaxis indicated that the former was effective against bacterial infections but that ketoconazole provided no protection against Aspergillus infections.\r"

Iron deficiency was observed during the running season in 34% of female cross-country runners, compared with 8% of male runners. Increased iron losses through gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 9 of 20 female runners; 7 of these 9 had iron deficiency. Dietary iron intake was low in both iron-deficient and iron-sufficient female runners, but dietary instruction did not increase iron intake significantly. Iron deficiency could not be prevented in 35% of the female runners treated with 60 mg of elemental iron daily, but adequate treatment was achieved with 180 mg. Iron losses in urine, sweat, and plasma were small and did not appear to be increased in iron-deficient runners. These findings indicate that female cross-country runners have a high incidence of iron deficiency that is associated with initially decreased iron stores and gastrointestinal bleeding.\r"

In 14,686 black and white St. Paul and Minneapolis schoolchildren aged 10 to 15 years, BP was measured twice during an initial screening examination. Children with systolic BP in the upper 30 percentiles of distribution after the initial screening had their BP remeasured two additional times at a rescreening examination. The prevalence of significant hypertension was determined according to BP criteria established by the Task Force report. After the two screening BP measurements were averaged, significant systolic hypertension was found in 1.0%, significant diastolic hypertension in 3.5%, and significant systolic or diastolic hypertension, or both, in 4.2% of the students. After the rescreening examination, the percentage of students remaining with significant hypertension was reduced to 0.3% for systolic, 0.8% for diastolic, and 1.1% for systolic or diastolic hypertension, or both. These results show that significant hypertension is uncommon in pre-high-school students and confirm the need for repeated BP measurements to make an accurate diagnosis of hypertension. However, the results should not detract from current recommendations to monitor BP in children on a yearly basis to detect longitudinal BP tracking patterns that may be consistent with early essential hypertension.\r"

In these patients, the SBT (endogenous blastogenesis), but not the mitogen response predicted sepsis. The current experiments were performed to clarify why the SBT is increased even when mitogen-stimulated blastogenesis is impaired. We found that neither selective lymphocyte subpopulation (OKT3, T4, T8), nor macrophage depletion returned the increased SBT to normal and that by phenotype and flow cytometric morphology, the Ficoll-Hypaque-purified leukocyte preparations of the burned patients contained fewer lymphocytes than controls (p less than 0.001). Discontinuous Percoll gradients and sheep-RBC rosetting were used to determine the relative contribution of T cells and non-T cells to the increased SBT. These studies indicated that both T cells and non-T cells were activated; however, the non-T cells were primarily responsible for the increased SBT. Thus the peripheral blood of burned patients contains a large fraction of metabolically active non-mononuclear cells that cosediment with mature lymphocytes and could result in artifactual alterations in the assessment of lymphocyte function by in vitro tests.\r"

We found naturally occurring wide interannual variations in incidence. The standard deviations of the age-specific incidence during the eight years before the introduction of H influenzae vaccine varied from 26% to 115% of the mean. If short-term changes in incidence were used to assess the efficacy of an H influenzae vaccine (which is less than 100% efficacious and not administered to all susceptible children), the conclusions could be erroneous. To avoid this bias, long-term cohort studies, case/control studies using concurrent controls, or large clinical trials are better choices. We found no significant change in overall incidence during the ten-year study period.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the factors associated with improved survival following coronary artery bypass surgery, we studied 5809 patients receiving medical or surgical therapy for coronary artery disease. Three factors were associated with a significant surgical survival benefit: more severe coronary disease, a worse prognosis with medical therapy, and a more recent operative date. Patients with more extensive coronary obstruction had the greatest improvement in survival. Patients with a poor prognosis because of factors such as older age, severe angina, or left ventricular dysfunction had a reduction in risk that was proportionate to their overall risk on medical therapy. Survival with surgery progressively improved over the study period and by 1984 surgery was significantly better than medical therapy for most patient subgroups. Thus, contemporary coronary revascularization is associated with improved longevity in many patients with ischemic heart disease, especially in those with adverse prognostic indicators.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred fifty consecutive patients treated for one or two vessel coronary artery disease with either balloon angioplasty or surgical bypass were monitored for 3 years in a study designed to determine the comparative long-term effectiveness of each treatment. The 125 patients having angioplasty were matched with the 125 patients having bypass, so that both groups had a similar number of patients with single or double vessel disease. The two groups did not significantly differ in age, male:female ratio, New York Heart Association class, or risk factors. The ejection fraction was 54 +/- 11 in the angioplasty group and 49 +/- 12 mmHg in the surgical patients (p = 0.0031). Angioplasty was deemed initially successful in 88% (110/125), unsuccessful in 10% (12/125), and in 2% (3/125) the lesion could not be crossed. Emergency bypass was performed in 10% (12/125). Four of the 125 angioplasty patients (3%) died within 30 days. Coronary artery bypass grafting was successfully performed on the matched set of surgical patients with 99% (124/125) discharged well. There was one (1%, 1/125) surgical death. The average hospital stay per patient was 4.8 +/- 3.1 days for angioplasty and 12.1 +/- 4.2 days for bypass grafting (p = 0.0000). Three-year postprocedure follow-up was obtained on 96% (236) of the 245 patients discharged alive. A second angioplasty was required in 18%, and 11 angioplasty patients subsequently required surgical bypass. Overall, 19% (23/121) of the angioplasty patients ultimately required bypass. Four late deaths occurred in the angioplasty group, which brought the early and late mortality rates to 7% (8/121). There were two late surgical deaths, which brought the combined surgical mortality to 2.5% (3/120), p = 0.1263. Patient evaluation reveals that 63% (76/121) of the angioplasty group are alive and in New York Heart Association class I or II 3 years after one or two angioplasty procedures. This figure compares with 92% (110/120) of surgical patients alive and in the same two New York Heart Association classes (p = 0.0000).\r"

PCP acquired while patients were inhaling pentamidine prophylactically was mild and had a case-fatality rate of only 9%. Further investigation of the prophylactic value of inhaled pentamidine is warranted.\r"

The fibrinogen adhesive system was easier to dispense than cyanoacrylate glue, did not require a completely dry surface, and stabilized within 3 minutes. Cartilage segment alignment with focal, complete fracture healing and symmetrical chondrocyte proliferation were seen in fibrogen adhesive-stinted larynges. In the cyanoacrylate glue-treated larynges, there was no alignment and minimal, asymmetrical chondrocyte proliferation. Gelatin film-stinted controls exhibited similar features.

Of these 57 children, 42 (74%) underwent surgical exploration, with 15 children (26%) of this subgroup demonstrating active congenital perilymphatic fistula. The prevalence of congenital perilymphatic fistula in a large, closely monitored population of children with unexplained sensorineural hearing loss appears to be at least 6% (15 of 244 children). The incidence may be higher because some congenital perilymphatic fistulae may leak intermittently and not be observed during middle ear surgery. Therefore, in children with suspected sensorineural hearing loss, early and frequent audiological evaluations should be made to rule out progressive/fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss. These children should also have radiographic imaging of their temporal bone by computed tomography scan. The use of both methods is the best indicator for congenital perilymphatic fistula.\r"

  ".W": "Since several studies have suggested that a slight increase in urinary albumin excretion (microalbuminuria) is predictive of nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus, we studied the relation of albumin excretion to renal structure in patients with insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes. Renal biopsy specimens were evaluated with light- and electron-microscopical morphometric techniques in 48 patients who had had diabetes for 5 to 40 years and who excreted less than 200 mg of urinary albumin per 24 hours. Patients in Group I (n = 26) had normal urinary albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, and blood pressure; those in Group II (n = 10) had increased urinary albumin excretion but normal creatinine clearance and blood pressure; those in Group III (n = 12) had increased urinary albumin excretion and hypertension, decreased creatinine clearance, or both. Glomerular structure varied similarly, ranging from normal to abnormal in Groups I and II, but was consistently abnormal in Group III. The thickness of the glomerular basement membrane, the fractional volume of the mesangium, and the mesangial volume per glomerulus in Group III exceeded the corresponding values in the other groups significantly. Thus, microalbuminuria, when present with hypertension, decreased creatinine clearance, or both, indicates established abnormalities of glomerular structure. Normal albumin excretion, or microalbuminuria without these other functional abnormalities, does not accurately predict the severity of the underlying glomerular lesions in patients with Type I diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "In mouse and man most peripheral T cells bear clonally variable receptors made up of alpha- and beta-chains which bind ligands on target cells consisting of peptide fragments of foreign antigens, complexed with cell surface proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the individual. In the thymus, developing T cells are selected to mature only if their receptors will be able to participate in self-MHC plus antigen recognition in the periphery. This positive selection occurs in the presence of self-MHC, but in the apparent absence of antigen, leading to the paradoxical conclusion that developing thymocytes must be positively selected by engagement of their receptors and self-MHC alone, although thymocytes that react too well with self-MHC are eliminated. To account for this, it has been suggested that MHC molecules in the thymus are not identical to those found elsewhere. To test this and other hypotheses, we have examined the ability of the presumed selecting cells, those of the thymus cortical epithelium, to present various MHC complexes to T cells. Our results indicate that MHC molecules on thymus epithelium are not always the same as those found elsewhere.\r"

  ".U": "89181948\r", 
  ".W": "The initiation of a specific immune response is believed to require not only activation through antigen-specific receptors on T cells and B cells but also antigen-independent interactions between accessory molecules. One such molecule is LFA-1, which enhances the avidity of interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, and is possibly involved in signal transduction across the T-cell membrane. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a surface glycoprotein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 80,000-110,000, has been defined as a ligand for LFA-1, and has been shown to participate in the interaction between T cells and monocytes. The determination of the precise contribution of such accessory molecules to antigen presentation, however, is complicated by the need to analyse against a background of multiple molecular interactions. We have investigated the role of LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions in antigen presentation directly by quantifying the contribution of ICAM-1 expression to T-cell stimulation using L-cell transfectants that co-express ICAM-1 and HLA-DR. In the case of transfectants expressing modest levels of HLA-DR, co-expression of ICAM-1 is critical for effective HLA class II-restricted and allospecific T-cell activation, pointing to an important role for ICAM-1 in the induction of T-cell responses.\r"

  ".W": "THE T-cell repertoire within an individual is biased to recognize antigen in the context of self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. This is thought to depend on a process of positive selection during development. Support for this notion has recently been obtained in experiments using transgenic mice bearing genes for T-cell receptors (TCR) of defined specificity: T cells expressing the introduced genes form the main part of the mature T-cell population only in mice that express the appropriate MHC product. We have now extended these observations using TCR transgenic mice homozygous for the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mutation which are defective in the rearrangement of both TCR and immunoglobulin genes. In this case mature thymocytes develop only in transgenic mice that express the MHC product which restricts the specificity of the transgenic TCR. This shows that the interaction of the alpha beta TCR with thymic MHC antigen is essential for the development of mature T cells. Furthermore, the peripheral lymph nodes of such mice are underdeveloped, suggesting that the peripheral expansion of mature T cells may require interactions with other lymphocytes expressing a range of receptors.\r"

We present the positron emission tomography (PET) scans, using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), of 12 patients who have histological and/or clinical evidence of malignant degeneration of a low-grade glioma. Each scan displays a focal area of hypermetabolism similar to that of malignant gliomas which arise de novo. Three patients also underwent PET scanning prior to malignant degeneration. When the initial scan is compared with the postmalignant degeneration study, a difference in tumoral glucose uptake can be recognized. A region previously shown to be hypometabolic develops focal hypermetabolism as malignant changes evolve. This study displays the utility of FDG-PET in the evaluation of malignant degeneration of low-grade gliomas. The knowledge that a neoplasm has altered its biological behavior may influence subsequent therapeutic options. If these findings can be confirmed in larger series and by other investigators, it is possible that FDG-PET may be adopted as one of the diagnostic tools for guiding the management of low-grade gliomas.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients with chronic pain due to severe vasospastic disorders in the upper limbs were treated with cervical spinal cord stimulation. In 8 patients the pain was due to reflex sympathetic dystrophy in the late stage of the disease, and 3 patients had severe idiopathic Raynaud's disease. The mean follow-up for both groups was 27 months. A total of 10 patients (90.9%) had good or excellent results. Thermographic and plethysmographic changes were observed in both groups. There seems to be a very close relationship between the increase of blood flow and the amount of pain relief achieved. In an attempt to quantify the intensity of pain, the visual analog scale and McGill Pain Questionnaire were used. Stimulation proved to be harmless, with no mortality and very low morbidity. The latter centered around local infection and displacement of the electrodes. No objective changes occurred in trophic alterations such as bone decalcification and ankylosis, but there were improvements in the alterations in the nails and skin. In the reflex sympathetic dystrophy group, the amount of pain relief achieved enabled most patients to undergo subsequent physiotherapy and rehabilitation. In severe cases of reflex sympathetic dystrophy and idiopathic Raynaud's disease, spinal cord stimulation is an alternative treatment that can be used as primary therapy or as secondary therapy after unsuccessful sympathectomy or sympathetic blocks.\r"

Computed tomography and enhanced cisternography showed a single hypothalamic mass, which proved at biopsy to be histiocytosis X. Further studies showed the disease to be restricted to the hypothalamus. The patient was treated with hormonal replacement therapy, but her visual acuity continued to worsen. Visual acuity improved after low-dose irradiation of the pituitary fossa and hypothalamus, which also led to disappearance of the mass. This case shows that localized hypothalamic histiocytosis X can be diagnosed and treated successfully before other systems become involved.\r"

We calculated asymmetry indices (AIs) of cerebral metabolic rate for matched left-right regions of interest (ROIs) and determined the extent of diaschisis by correlative analyses. For the Alzheimer group, we found cerebellar AIs correlated negatively, and thalamic AIs positively, with those of the cerebral hemisphere and frontal, temporal, parietal, and angular cortices, while basal ganglia AIs correlated positively with frontal cortical AIs. The only significant correlation of AIs for normal subjects was between the thalamus and cerebral hemisphere. These data indicate that PET is a sensitive technique for detecting diaschisis.\r"

  ".W": "The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends administering full-dose diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, (DTP) vaccine to preterm infants, beginning at 2 months' chronologic age. Many physicians, however, continue to administer DTP vaccine at a reduced dosage in an attempt to lessen side effects. This study was designed to quantitate the immune response of 20 preterm infants immunized with half-dose DTP vaccine and to determine the nature and extent of side effects. Control subjects were 25 preterm infants immunized with full-dose vaccine. Although 96% of infants who received a full dose were able to mount a serologic response to pertussis after a second dose of DTP, 45% of infants who received a half dose were unable to mount a similar immune response to pertussis even after a third dose of DTP and required a full-dose (fourth dose of DTP) vaccine to better ensure protection. Serologic responses to diphtheria and tetanus were similar in the two groups. The incidence of side effects in preterm infants receiving both full-dose and half-dose DTP was less than that seen in a full-term population. Thus, the physician caring for the preterm infant should adhere to the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation for the immunization of preterm infants and offer full-dose DTP vaccine at the routine time intervals of 2, 4, 6, and 15 or 18 months' chronologic age to ensure adequate protection.\r"

  ".U": "89184536\r", 
  ".W": "A combination of cDNA sequencing of the complete coding region, protein comparisons, binding site mapping, and electron microscopic imaging has permitted the formulation of a structural model of cytotactin. Cytotactin is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that displays a restricted tissue distribution during development. Although there appears to be a single cytotactin gene, multiple cytotactin polypeptides and mRNAs are detected in a variety of tissues. We report here the sequences and relationships of cDNAs that encode the complete amino acid sequences of two cytotactin polypeptides in chicken brain. The translated cDNA sequences agree with those obtained by direct analysis of cytotactin and fragments of the molecule. All regions of the polypeptides appear to be identical except for a 273 amino acid segment found in the larger but not in the smaller. At their amino termini, both polypeptides contain a cysteine-rich segment that probably includes those residues that link monomers into hexamers. This segment is followed by 13 epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) repeats and then 8 consecutive segments that each resemble the type III repeats found in fibronectin. At their carboxyl termini, the polypeptides are similar to the beta and gamma chains of fibrinogen, including a calcium-binding segment. The additional sequence in the large polypeptide is inserted after the fifth type III repeat and includes three additional type III repeats. On RNA transfer blot analyses, cytotactin cDNA probes detected a 6.4-kilobase (kb) component in both brain and gizzard and larger mRNAs in both tissues, but those in gizzard were larger by about 1 kb than those in brain. A probe specific to the insert did not hybridize to the 6.4-kb mRNA in either tissue but detected the larger mRNAs in both tissues. At least a portion of the insert is thus present in both tissues, but there may be additional inserts in the gizzard mRNAs. The proposed model of cytotactin specifies the orientation of the polypeptides, the localization of interchain disulfide bonds, the structural elements constituting the thin and thick segments (EGFL repeats and type III repeats, respectively), the terminal fibrinogen-like nodular region, and the relative location of the cell-binding region.\r"

During characterization of the class III region for the presence of additional loci, we have located a duplicated locus encoding the major heat shock protein HSP70 between the complement and tumor necrosis factor genes. The HSP70 loci are 12 kilobases apart and lie 92 kilobases telomeric of the C2 gene. As HSP70 proteins have been linked with a protective role during and after cellular stress, and HSP70 analogues are often presented as antigens in bacterial and protozoal infections, this finding may have major implications with regard to the major histo-compatibility complex and associated diseases.\r"

To better characterize the T-cell response to soluble antigen with HIV infection, we have isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and purified populations of CD4+ lymphocytes from healthy HIV antibody-positive subjects, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex (ARC), and healthy HIV antibody-negative controls. T-lymphocyte function was determined by proliferative response to lectin (phytohemagglutinin), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore, purified recombinant HIV envelope gp120, tetanus toxoid antigen, and tetanus toxoid antigen in the presence of recombinant gp120 or purified recombinant soluble CD4. PBLs and CD4+ lymphocytes from asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects responded equally well to lectin, PMA, and/or calcium ionophore and to tetanus toxoid as cells from uninfected control subjects. The cells that proliferated in response to a soluble antigenic stimulus did not respond to gp120. Cells from subjects with ARC had a selective antigen recognition defect independent of the number of CD4+ lymphocytes. Recombinant gp120 inhibited CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation to antigenic stimulus by 30-40%. Recombinant soluble CD4, a proposed therapeutic for HIV, had no effect on T-cell response to antigen. A selective antigen recognition response was not compromised early in HIV infection but was compromised in subjects with ARC. Inhibition of proliferation to tetanus toxoid by gp120 suggests that HIV may affect major histocompatibility complex II restricted antigen recognition independent of CD4+ cell loss.\r"

  ".U": "89184575\r", 
  ".W": "In the frog nerve-muscle preparation, there is evidence for nonquantal release of acetylcholine (ACh) at a level 100 times that attributable to spontaneous quantal events (miniature endplate potentials). It is widely assumed that nonquantal release occurs near the sites of quantal release (active zones) in the nerve terminal, close to the postsynaptic muscle membrane. This high level of nonquantal ACh release has led to the suggestion that it may serve a trophic function at the nerve-muscle junction. However, the precise origin and mechanism of nonquantal release have not been determined. We have used outside-out patches of ACh receptor-rich membrane as a sensitive technique for the direct measurement of ACh release from highly localized regions of enzymatically treated nerve terminals and have found little detectable ACh \"leakage\" from active-zone regions. If all of the nonquantal ACh release were localized to the under surface of the nerve terminal, we estimate that we would have detected more than 10 times the low level detected with our patch probe. Furthermore, although quantal release was easily measurable, vesicular exocytosis (hypothesized to insert ACh transport proteins into the plasma membrane, thereby producing the leak) did not increase single-channel activity in the patch probe above that attributable to quantal release. We conclude that, at rest, the active-zone region of nerve terminals is not a major source of nonquantal ACh release and that vesicular exocytosis does not noticeably increase the level of nonquantal release from the nerve terminal. Thus, with biochemical measurements that indicate that spontaneous ACh release is relatively unchanged by prior denervation, these results question the assumed source and mechanism of nonquantal release and the suggestion that leakage of ACh from active-zone regions plays a trophic role in nerve-muscle interaction.\r"

Immunochemical analysis has shown these polypeptides to be the products of three of the genes UL52, UL5, and UL8 that are required for replication of a plasmid containing a herpes simplex 1 origin (oriS). In addition to helicase activity, the enzyme contains a tightly associated DNA primase. Thus, the three-subunit enzyme is a helicase-primase complex that may prime lagging-strand synthesis as it unwinds DNA at the viral replication fork.\r"

In this study, we analyzed characteristics of high-affinity IL-5 receptors on IL-5-dependent early B-cell lines (T-88 and T88-M), mouse myeloma cells (MOPC-104E), and BCL1-B20 cells. All cell lines had two classes of IL-5 binding sites, but T88-M cells bore the highest number of high-affinity receptors. The number of high-affinity IL-5 receptors on BCL1-B20 cells could be up-regulated 3-fold by lipopolysaccharide and down-regulated by IL-5. Disuccinimidyl tartarate crosslinking of 35S-labeled IL-5 to the receptors on the T88-M and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BCL1-B20 cells revealed two major 35S-labeled components of Mr 92,500 and Mr 160,000, even when the binding of 35S-labeled IL-5 was carried out under high-affinity conditions (100 pM 35S-labeled IL-5). The Mr 92,500 component, but not the Mr 160,000 component, was detected in the lysates of MOPC-104E and T-88 cells, both of which bore a large number of low-affinity receptors and a limited number of high-affinity receptors. The results suggest that the Mr 92,500 component represents the complex of IL-5 with the low-affinity Mr 46,500 receptor, whereas the high-affinity receptor consists of the Mr 46,500 peptide and an additional peptide.\r"

  ".W": "A T-cell clone, 10BK.1, was established from the draining lymph nodes of (B10 x B10.BR)F1 mice immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) according to standard protocols. Upon coculture with the antigen, 10BK.1 cells reacted by production of lymphokines and by proliferation despite the absence of additional antigen-presenting cells. These T cells do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on the cell surface as assessed on the basis of several criteria: by cytofluorometric analysis I-A and I-E determinants were not detectable; 10BK.1 cells could not act as antigen-presenting cells for long-term-cultured MHC class II-restricted T-cell clones; and monoclonal antibodies directed at both MHC class II isotypic complexes (I-A, I-E) did not suppress their OVA-induced activation. In contrast, proliferation of 10BK.1 T cells in response to OVA was abrogated by antibodies directed at H-2Kb antigens. Inhibition experiments employing antibodies directed at Lyt-2 and L3T4 antigens in addition to cytofluorometric analysis revealed that T-cell clone 10BK.1 exhibits the Thy-1+,Lyt-2+,Ly-1-,L3T4- phenotype. 10BK.1 cells pulsed with OVA and fixed with glutaraldehyde induced proliferation of untreated 10BK.1 cells. These data support the theory that 10BK.1 T cells present the exogenous globular protein OVA to one another in an MHC class I-restricted manner, resulting in cell activation and proliferation independent of added accessory cells.\r"

Concentrations of recombinant TNF-alpha as low as 50 pg/ml induced a significant increase over background of HIV expression in the ACH-2 cells as determined by supernatant reverse transcriptase activity. The HIV-inducing effects of TNF-alpha could not be explained by toxic effects on the cells. In addition, both the uninfected parental cell line (A3.01) and the infected ACH-2 cells were shown to have high-affinity receptors for TNF-alpha. Transient-transfection experiments demonstrated that the inductive effects of TNF-alpha were due to specific activation of the HIV long terminal repeat. These studies provide evidence that TNF-alpha may play a role in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of HIV infection.\r"

  ".U": "89184634\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies, we showed that blood monocyte elaboration of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a known stimulator of bone resorption, was higher in osteoporotic patients with rapid bone turnover than in those with slow turnover and in nonosteoporotic subjects. Since an acceleration of bone loss following menopause contributes to the risk of osteoporosis in women, we have studied the effects of menopause and ovarian steroid treatment on IL-1 release by monocytes obtained from nonosteoporotic and osteoporotic women. IL-1 activity in the monocyte culture medium derived from untreated postmenopausal women (nonosteoporotic and osteoporotic) was higher than in the medium derived from either untreated premenopausal or estrogen/progesterone-treated postmenopausal women. A significant negative correlation was found between IL-1 and years since menopause in both the healthy (r = -0.75; P less than 0.005) and the osteoporotic (r = -0.61; P less than 0.01) untreated postmenopausal women. The difference between the two slopes was significant at P less than 0.05. Premenopausal IL-1 levels were achieved within 8 years of menopause in the nonosteoporotic, but not in the osteoporotic, subjects in whom increases were evident as long as 15 years after menopause. IL-1 also correlated inversely with vertebral mineral density (r = -0.37; P less than 0.05), as measured by quantitative computed tomography. In prospective studies, treatment with estrogen/progesterone for 1 month caused a substantial highly significant decrease in IL-1 activity in each of three nonosteoporotic and five osteoporotic women, confirming the apparent effect of hormone therapy observed in the cross-sectional analysis. Although a cause-effect relationship has not been established, it is our hypothesis, based on these data, that alterations in IL-1 production may underlie the postmenopausal acceleration in bone loss and its inhibition by ovarian steroids. Persistent elevation of IL-1 secretion appears to be a feature of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

In this report, we demonstrated that SIV had a restricted host range among human CD4+ cells when compared with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or type 2. This restricted tropism was associated with the inability of the SIV envelope glycoprotein to induce membrane fusion in cells not susceptible to productive exogenous infection by SIV. We conclude that the major route of SIV entry into CD4+ cells is by envelope-mediated direct fusion with the cell and that additional envelope-cell interactions after CD4 binding are required for productive infection.\r"

Macrophages from C3H/HeJ or C57Bl/6 mice were stimulated with purified TSST-1 alone or in combination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A dramatic synergistic thymocyte-proliferative response was induced by supernatants from C57Bl/6 macrophages stimulated with both TSST-1 and LPS. No enhanced response was induced by supernatants from C3H/HeJ macrophages. A portion of the enhanced response induced by C57Bl/6 macrophage supernatants was attributed to synergism between IL-1 and residual TSST-1 in the thymocyte assay. The addition of monoclonal antibody to TSST-1 to the supernatants eliminated the effects of residual TSST-1 in the thymocyte assay and demonstrated a synergistic induction of IL-1. These data (1) show that LPS can enhance macrophage responsiveness to TSST-1; (2) suggest that TSST-1 not only induces IL-1 secretion but also enhances target cell responsiveness to IL-1; and (3) further support the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of toxic shock syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The shear stress resistance of cultured human endothelium was investigated on 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts. Endothelial cell attachment was promoted by precoating the grafts with fibrin glue, which contained human fibronectin and inhibitors of fibrinolysis (aprotinin and tranexam acid). To evaluate the possible effect of fibrinolysis on cell detachment, seven grafts were lined with adult human saphenous vein endothelial cells (AHSVEC) and 11 with fibrinolytically almost inactive human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Endothelial cell seeding was performed in a microprocessor-controlled rotation device, allowing a low inoculum of 12 X 10(4) endothelial cells/cm2. Grafts were then cultivated for 9 days to enable the maturation of the cytoskeleton, before they were exposed to pulsatile shear stress for 48 hours. A mock circulation simulated the flow patterns and the wall shear forces of the femoral artery. After a 3-hour seeding process, 45% of AHSVEC and 43% of HUVEC were attached to the fibrin matrix, forming a confluent monolayer. After 24 hours of perfusion, a cell loss of 23% in AHSVEC- and of 42% in HUVEC-lined grafts was encountered. In spite of a further cell loss during the following 24 hours of perfusion, the majority of the graft surface was still covered by endothelial cells. Therefore we conclude that fibrin glue is a suitable substrate for the formation of a shear stress-resistant endothelial cell monolayer on polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated 15 patients with one or more transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the internal carotid artery territory within the month following the most recent TIA. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography, using intravenous xenon-133 before and after injection of 1 g acetazolamide. Six patients had severe carotid stenosis or occlusion; the other nine patients had no significant carotid lesions. Twenty age-matched volunteers free of neurologic symptoms or history were used as controls. Mean CBF in the sylvian region was not significantly different between patients and controls. Seven patients exhibited a focal hypoperfusion at rest in the symptomatic hemisphere, and their hypoperfused areas were hyporeactive after administration of acetazolamide. Seven other patients exhibited hyporeactive areas after acetazolamide administration while their CBF tomograms at rest were normal. Thus, CBF abnormalities were detected in 14 of the 15 patients. Our findings suggest that CBF measured early after acetazolamide administration could be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of TIA. In the nine patients with no significant lesion of the internal carotid artery, the areas of hypoperfusion were small and were probably related to the focal ischemic event. In the six patients with severe lesions of the internal carotid artery, abnormalities were of variable size and intensity but were often large and pronounced. The discrepancy between these two subgroups of patients could be ascribed to the hemodynamic influence of the internal carotid artery lesions. Moreover, our findings may provide some insight into the pathophysiology of TIAs.\r"

  ".W": "To further define the sensory projections to the circle of Willis, we measured concentrations of immunoreactive substance P in pial arteries of cats following either bilateral removal of the C1-3 dorsal root ganglia (six cats) or bilateral removal of the trigeminal ganglia (three cats). Removal of the dorsal root ganglia decreased concentrations of the tachykinin substance P in the vertebral artery and the basilar artery and its branches by 72% and 50-66%, respectively. Bilateral removal of the trigeminal ganglia decreased substance P concentrations in all forebrain vessels including the rostral basilar artery, although only concentrations in the anterior cerebral artery were significantly lower than those in unilaterally lesioned cats (p less than 0.01). Hence, the vertebrobasilar artery and its tributaries are invested by substance P-containing fibers originating from the upper cervical dorsal root ganglia, and the anterior cerebral artery is innervated by both trigeminal ganglia. If a similar anatomy exists in humans, our data provide an explanation for the occipital localization of headaches arising from the vertebrobasilar arteries and for bilateral headaches following stimulation of the anterior cerebral artery.\r"

  ".W": "QRS intervals in the ECGs of members of the Framingham Heart Study cohort and offspring were measured to provide an estimate of the prevalence of intraventricular block in the general population. Intervals of greater than or equal to 0.09 second appear in men twice as commonly as in women, are rare before age 50 to 60, and shift from a predominance of right bundle branch block in the young to an indeterminate pattern in the elderly. Complete intraventricular block (QRS interval greater than or equal to 0.12 second) is seen in 11% of elderly men and 5% of elderly women. Aside from age and sex, logistic regression indicates strong associations with concurrent manifestations of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and atrioventricular block, as well as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ventricular extrasystoles. Among those subjects free of clinical coronary disease and congestive heart failure, associations between QRS interval and age, sex, atrioventricular block, and ECG left ventricular hypertrophy remain significant by multivariate analysis. Whether people with prolonged QRS intervals need special monitoring or attention cannot be told from these data.\r"

These 27 patients represent 27 of 35 (77%) consecutive patients with acute Q-wave infarctions who were injected with indium-111 antimyosin. In the remaining 8 patients either tracer uptake was too faint or the scans were technically inadequate to permit infarct sizing from SPECT reconstructions. In the 27 patients studied, infarct location by electrocardiogram was anterior in 15 and inferoposterior in 12. Nine patients had a history of prior infarction. Each patient received 2 mCi of indium-111 antimyosin followed by SPECT imaging 48 hours later. Infarct mass was determined from coronal slices using a threshold value obtained from a human torso/cardiac phantom. Infarct size ranged from 11 to 87 g mean 48.5 +/- 24). Anterior infarcts were significantly (p less than 0.01) larger (60 +/- 20 g) than inferoposterior infarcts (34 +/- 21 g). For patients without prior MI, there were significant inverse correlations between infarct size and ejection fraction (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01) and wall motion score (r = 0.58, p less than 0.01) obtained from predischarge gated blood pool scans. Peak creatine kinase-MB correlated significantly with infarct size for patients without either reperfusion or right ventricular infarction (r = 0.66). Seven patients without prior infarcts had additional simultaneous indium-111/thallium-201 SPECT studies using dual energy windows.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study we investigated the frequency of 14 AAs in a total of 268 apparently normal children (151 boys and 117 girls; age range, 1 month to 14 years). Forty-one children (22 boys and 19 girls) were positive for at least one AA, usually in a low titer; two children were positive for two AAs. None of these children had a personal or family history of autoimmune diseases. The percentage of children positive for each AA was as follows: antinuclear, 3%; anti-smooth muscle, 2.6%; antireticulin, 2.6%; antimitochondrial, 1.1%; rheumatoid factor, 0.6%; antiribosomal, 0.4%; anti-gastric parietal cells, 5.2%; and anti-thyroid microsomal, 1.3%. Anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-intestinal epithelial cells, antiliver and antikidney microsomal, antithyroglobulin, anti-islet cells, and complement-fixing anti-islet cell antibodies were not detected in any serum. Fifteen of the 41 positive children were checked for the presence of AAs two years later; six (40%) were still positive, always for the same AA, without major differences in titer. Our results suggest that the overall frequency of AAs in apparently healthy children is quite similar to that reported in young adults; this AA positivity seems most often to represent a transient phenomenon.\r"

Autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction was significantly reduced in all patients, along with CD4-positive cells that are the responder cells in this reaction. A relative increase in the percentage of LAK cells was also observed in neoplastic patients with a normalization after local treatment of the HCC. In the light of promising results obtained by Rosenberg et al. by adoptive transfer of LAK cells activated with Interleukin-2 (IL2) in various cancers, our results support a similar therapeutic trial in HCC patients.\r"

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We used a phytohemagglutinin-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2) activity assay and a spontaneous plaque-forming cell assay to evaluate T-cell and B-cell function, respectively, in 34 clinically healthy family members of six SLE probands. RESULTS: Impaired IL-2 activity was found in 15 of the 29 consanguineous relatives. There was no relation between the household relatives and the nonhousehold relatives; none of the five nonconsanguineous household persons had abnormal results. Results for the B-cell assay were abnormal in 22 of the 29 consanguineous relatives. The B-cell abnormalities were more commonly observed in the consanguineous household relatives; four of the five nonconsanguineous household relatives also had abnormal assay results. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the impaired IL-2 activity in relatives appears to strongly correlate with a genetic relationship. Although the evidence favors a genetic basis for the B-cell abnormalities, environmental effects may also contribute to the familial occurrence of these abnormalities.\r"

Black women in this age range were hospitalized at a slightly higher rate than White women for AMI, yet experienced a 19 per cent lower rate of coronary arteriography and a 52 per cent lower rate of CABG surgery.

Any patient receiving preoperative medication known to interfere with platelet function was excluded from this study. Platelet function was evaluated by measurement of platelet aggregation with both adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and epinephrine-induced aggregation tests. Ten patients served as a control population receiving fentanyl anesthesia and no SNP. Nineteen patients received SNP, as clinically indicated, following the induction of anesthesia (and prior to cardiopulmonary bypass) to maintain a mean blood pressure of 80 mmHg. The infusion rate and total dose of SNP delivered was recorded for each patient. Infusion rates of SNP greater than or equal to 3 micrograms.kg.-1 min-1 resulted in a dose-related decrease in platelet aggregation (P less than 0.05). This reduction in platelet function was accompanied by a concomitant increase in bleeding time from 5.8 +/- 0.6 to 9.3 +/- 0.4 min in the patients receiving SNP (P less than 0.05). In addition, with the administration of a total dose of SNP greater than or equal to 16 mg, a significant reduction in platelet aggregation (P less than 0.05) was observed. Platelet aggregation studies and bleeding time performed in the control group (following the administration of fentanyl (30 micrograms/kg) did not reveal any deviation from baseline values. The results from this in vivo study support previous in vitro data demonstrating a detrimental effect upon platelet function following SNP infusion.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the capacities of alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes to synthesize tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in response to LPS. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of healthy nonsmoking subjects, and blood monocytes were obtained by adherence of mononuclear cells to plastic. TNF activity was measured in supernatants and cell lysates as cytotoxicity to L929 fibroblasts (uptake of neutral red at 570 nm). TNF activity of alveolar macrophages stimulated at 10(6) cells/ml with LPS (10 micrograms/ml) for 16 h was 596 +/- 367, and of blood monocytes it was 60 +/- 84 U/ml (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.005). At no concentration of LPS and at no period of stimulation did alveolar macrophages express less TNF activity than did blood monocytes. In concurrent experiments, supernatants of LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages contained less IL-1 activity than did blood monocytes. Lysates of both cell types contained less than 20% of total TNF activity. The TNF activity of LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages was neutralized greater than 99% by monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha; control monoclonal antibody OKT3 had no effect. Next, alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes were biosynthetically labeled with [3H]leucine during incubation with LPS; supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-TNF, and precipitates were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels. Autoradiographs indicated that immunoreactive TNF was produced by both blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages and that the relative molecular weights were identical (17,000).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine whether tuberculosis is associated with elevated levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors (SIL-2R), patients with both pulmonary (n = 12) and extrapulmonary (n = 8) disease were studied. SIL-2R were measured in sera using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prior to treatment, all 20 patients had levels of SIL-2R significantly greater than those of the 14 control subjects. Longitudinal study of patients with pulmonary disease revealed that levels of SIL-2R remained elevated in 11 of 12 patients after 2 months, and in four of six patients after 3 months of treatment. These findings suggest that tuberculosis is characterized by prolonged activation of the immune system despite optimal chemotherapy and that SIL-2R may distinguish active immunity from immunologic memory to this infection.\r"

  ".W": "Inhalation of asbestos fibers is associated with a marked increase in the risk of developing pulmonary malignancy, particularly bronchogenic carcinoma. As natural killer (NK) cells are specialized lymphocytes that are considered to have an important in vivo role in the recognition and destruction of malignant cells, we examined the capacity of asbestos fibers (chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite) to interfere with the NK activity of nylon wool-nonadherent, human blood lymphocytes (51Cr-release assay, K562 target cells, 14 h effector-to-target ratio = 50:1). Final asbestos concentrations used were 1 to 1,000 micrograms/ml. None of the fibers altered spontaneous target cell lysis or lymphocyte viability. All types of asbestos suppressed NK activity in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was most marked with chrysotile, which exerted a profound inhibitory effect on blood NK cell activity; at 100 micrograms/ml, NK activity was inhibited 84 +/- 2% (p less than 0.001). The suppressive effects of asbestos were exerted directly on the NK cells (large granular lymphocytes, 91 +/- 2% inhibition at 100 micrograms/ml; p less than 0.001). Exposure of lymphocytes to recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2, 150 units/ml) for 24 h prior to exposure to asbestos restored the level of activity to 99 +/- 6% of the original value (p less than 0.001), and lung lymphocytes that were exposed to IL-2 in vivo (active sarcoidosis) were resistant to suppression by asbestos. Similar results were observed in a group of patients with asbestosis. This suppression of NK activity may contribute to the increased susceptibility of asbestos-exposed persons to the development of pulmonary malignancy.\r"

In the present study, we evaluated the utility of this technique to provide complete ventilatory support for prolonged time periods (6 to 8 h, selected arbitrarily). In 10 deeply anesthetized dogs, a single electrode was introduced onto the epidural surface of the spinal cord and positioned at the T2-T3 spinal level. Bilateral phrenicotomy was performed in all animals to prevent possible diaphragm activation. The spinal cord was rhythmically stimulated approximately 13 times/min with trains of 15- to 20-Hz impulses of sufficient amplitude to achieve inspired volumes of 13 to 15 ml/kg and pressure-time index (product of duty cycle and delta P/Pmax) of less than 0.15 with each contraction. Level of alveolar ventilation was monitored by end-tidal PCO2 and intermittent arterial blood gas measurements. Mean inspired volume and minute ventilation were 236 +/- 7.84 (SE) ml and 3.12 +/- 0.13 (SE) L/min, respectively, and not significantly different between the first and sixth hours of continuous stimulation. Mean duty cycle (Ti/Ttot) was 0.26 +/- 0.01. Mean airway pressure (delta P) during prolonged electrical stimulation under conditions of airway occlusion was 8.05 +/- 0.61 (SE) cm H2O.

This population includes 23 patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS), two with late onset CHS and hypothalamic dysfunction, three with hypoventilation associated with Chiari II malformation and myelomeningocele, and five with quadriplegia. Our experience, totalling 192 system-years and 96 patient-years of pacing, has enabled us to document the nature and frequency of problems related to the implanted components of the Avery Laboratories (S-232-1) pacemaker system when used in a pediatric population. By life table analysis, the mean time to need for replacement of any implanted component was 56.3 months. A total of 26 failures requiring component replacement occurred and were classified into four types: (1) receiver failure (15 cases), (2) electrode wire or wire insulation breakage (six cases), (3) infection requiring diaphragm pacer system removal (three cases), and (4) mechanical nerve injury (two cases). We conclude that the present diaphragm pacing system is effective but not without risk of biomedical component failure. The present system might be substantially improved by (1) a modified receiver design with a hermetic seal to prevent fluid penetration, (2) stronger, better insulated electrode wires, and (3) modifications of surgical technique and electrode type to prevent phrenic nerve damage.\r"

DESIGN: Measurement of drug levels as part of an open study of dapsone alone and randomized, double-blind comparison of trimethoprim-dapsone with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with AIDS. SETTING: County hospital and AIDS clinic. PATIENTS: Eighteen patients treated with dapsone alone, 30 with trimethoprim-dapsone, and 30 with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. INTERVENTION: Dapsone, 100 mg/d; trimethoprim, 20 mg/kg body weight per day, and sulfamethoxazole, 100 mg/kg.d; administered for 21 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Concentrations of dapsone were 40% higher in patients treated with trimethoprim-dapsone than in those treated with dapsone alone (2.1 compared with 1.5 micrograms/mL; P less than 0.05). Trimethoprimdapsone-treated patients had fewer treatment failures but more side effects and treatment terminations due to toxicity than those treated with dapsone alone. The concentration of trimethoprim was 48.4% higher in patients treated with trimethoprim-dapsone than in those treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, (18.4 compared with 12.4 micrograms/mL; P less than 0.05). Discontinuation of therapy due to toxicity was commoner in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group (57% compared with 30%). CONCLUSIONS: A bidirectional drug interaction exists between dapsone and trimethoprim, resulting in higher concentrations of each in the presence of the other.\r"

In both forms of acute viral hepatitis production of lymphocyte activating factor was severely depressed during the first week, increased gradually during the further course of the illness, but did not reach normal concentrations within the first three weeks after onset of the acute symptoms of the disease. No correlation could be found between in vitro production of lymphocyte activating factor and the severity of liver disease as estimated by the rise of serum concentrations of transaminases, bilirubin, or several parameters of acute phase reaction (alpha 1 antitrypsin, C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate). The reduced production of interleukin-1, as assessed by determination of lymphocyte activating factor, could explain the only moderate acute phase reaction seen during acute viral hepatitis.\r"

Seventy-two percent of anglers were familiar with the health advisory and 57% had changed their fishing or fish consumption habits as a result of the advisory. The mean PCB serum congener sum level for 192 anglers was 2.2 micrograms/l (range = nondetectable to 27.1 micrograms/l); mean DDE was 6.3 micrograms/l (range = nondetectable to 40.0 micrograms/l). Statistically significant positive Spearman correlations were observed between sport-caught fish meals and PCB and DDE sera levels (R = .21 and .14, respectively) and between kilograms of fish caught and PCB sera levels (R = .25).

Because it had been previously shown that in vivo depletion of T cells leads to impaired wound healing, the effect of depleting T cell subsets on subsequent fibroplasia was studied. T helper/effector cells were depleted by the use of the monoclonal antibody GK1.5, reactive against the L3T4 antigen (CD4). T suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes were depleted by using the 2.43 monoclonal antibody reactive against the Lyt 2 antigen (CD8). In the first experiment, Balb/c mice were treated with the antibodies starting at 24 hours before wounding was performed, and weekly thereafter. Depletion of the T helper/effector cells had no effect on wound-breaking strength or hydroxyproline deposition in sponge granulomas, whereas depletion of T suppressor/cytotoxic cells significantly enhanced both of these healing parameters. In a second experiment, T cell subset depletion was started on Days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 postwounding, and treatments were continued weekly thereafter. Once again, depletion of T helper/effector cells had no effect on wound healing, whereas depletion of T suppressor/cytotoxic cells markedly increased both wound-breaking strength and collagen synthesis. In conclusion, the data show that T suppressor/cytotoxic cells have a counter-regulatory role in wound healing, whereas the T cell subset responsible for up-regulating wound healing remains to be identified.\r"

Liver pathology was documented in 85 patients: 45 patients had schistosomal hepatic fibrosis, 17 had nonalcoholic cirrhosis, and 23 had mixed pattern (hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis). The preoperative data base for these three groups was matched (p greater than 0.05), with a mean follow-up of 79 +/- 20, 70 +/- 14, and 77 +/- 22 months for each population, respectively. The results showed low operative mortality (4.8%), high cumulative patency rate (94.8%) and low recurrent variceal hemorrhage (5.6%). The biochemical data showed significant increase in serum bilirubin (p less than 0.001) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (p less than 0.05) in the nonschistosomal patients. Chronic hyperbilirubinemia was found in 33% of the schistosomal group. Prograde portal perfusion was detected in 94% of the patients, with development of collaterals in 91%. The angiographic pattern of these collaterals was 50% pancreatic, 45% gastric, and 26% colosplenic. Patients with mixed liver disease had a high incidence of Grade III portal perfusion (57%) and more common pancreatic and gastric collaterals (71%). The cumulative survival for all patients was 74.1%, with hepatic cell failure being the leading cause of death (13 patients, 50% of all deaths). The schistosomal patients had a 91.6% incidence, whereas the cirrhotic and mixed groups had survival rates of 75.6% and 65.2%, respectively. Also, of a 15% total incidence of encephalopathy, 4.4% was related to the schistosomal patients, 23.5% to the cirrhotics, and 21.7% to the mixed population. Statistically, the survival rate was significantly better (p less than 0.05) and encephalopathy was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in the schistosomal population. In conclusion, this data shows that: 1) DSRS has a high patency rate and a low variceal hemorrhage recurrence rate; 2) it maintains some degree of portal perfusion in patients with different nonalcoholic liver diseases, despite development of collaterals; and 3) the schistosomal patients have a better survival rate, with a low incidence of encephalopathy after DSRS, compared with the cirrhotic and mixed populations.\r"

Shortly thereafter, we anecdotally noted increased conduction abnormalities. This prompted us to compare serially all patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting during 1987 for perioperative and late conduction system disturbances after either crystalloid or blood cardioplegia. Surgeons and techniques including topical cooling did not differ. Forty-one (23%) of 179 patients with crystalloid cardioplegia had conduction disturbances versus 141 (49%) of 289 patients with blood cardioplegia (p less than 0.001). Perioperative complete heart block requiring atrioventricular sequential pacing occurred in 20 patients with crystalloid cardioplegia versus 67 patients with blood cardioplegia (p less than 0.002), and atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacing was present in 4 and 12 patients (p less than 0.001), respectively.

We found that the results of testing for fibrin degradation products converted from negative to positive in 17 of 20 patients who received unwashed SMB versus 1 of 14 patients who received washed SMB (p less than 0.0001). Other coagulation studies did not reveal disseminated intravascular coagulation in either group, nor were there differences in blood use between the two groups. The unwashed SMB contained high titers of fibrin degradation products (mean reciprocal titer = 354 +/- 161) compared with washed SMB (mean reciprocal titer = 34 +/- 18) (p less than 0.01). Based on the volume of SMB infused, the amount of fibrin degradation products in unwashed SMB was sufficient to account for the positive fibrin degradation product assays after infusion in this group. We conclude that infusion of unwashed SMB may confuse the interpretation of tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation or fibrinolysis. As this could lead to unnecessary blood component use and is preventable by washing before infusion, we recommend that the routine infusion of unwashed SMB no longer be employed.\r"

  ".W": "Thermal coronary angiography was evaluated in 50 patients undergoing 137 saphenous vein and 48 internal mammary artery bypass grafts. A total of 177 thermal coronary angiograms were performed after completion of the distal anastomoses by injection of cold cardioplegia into the vein or by reperfusion with warmer blood in the internal mammary artery grafts. These angiograms provided details of graft and anastomosis patency, flow directions, and presence of native coronary stenoses. Temperature differences between the injectant and the epimyocardium of greater than 4 degrees C resulted in high-contrast images. Thermal coronary angiograms were obtained in 173 of the 177 studied bypass grafts; 172 grafts were patent, and 1 internal mammary artery graft was occluded. Unsuspected stenoses were detected at the site of four distal anastomoses. Subsequently, two anastomoses were successfully revised and three additional grafts performed. Ninety-six native coronary stenoses were located in the recipient coronary arteries. In ten instances, the thermal coronary angiograms were obscured by excess fat or myocardium, thereby impeding correct image analysis. We conclude that thermal coronary angiography can be clinically relevant and helps improve decision making during coronary artery bypass operations.\r"

Thus, we chose to evaluate it in a model of experimental calf aortic valve replacement that has been previously well established. Concentrated fibrinogen and topical thrombin were sprayed to form a thin layer of fibrin glue over the mediastinal tissues of 20 consecutive calves undergoing aortic valve replacement. Chest tube outputs of these animals were compared with those of the preceding 20 consecutive calves undergoing aortic valve replacement without fibrin glue. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon, and no other technical changes were made between the two series. Total postoperative chest tube output (mean +/- standard error) was 553 +/- 50 mL for the calves treated with fibrin glue and 1,155 +/- 103 mL for the control calves (p less than 0.001). On histological examination of mediastinal tissues from 5 treated calves killed 6 weeks after operation, there was no evidence of inflammation, fibrosis, or residual fibrin. To our knowledge, this is the first controlled laboratory study to show that fibrin glue spray is an effective hemostatic agent and that it produces no long-term tissue reaction.\r"

  ".W": "In several diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoimmune hemolytic anemias, the numbers of complement receptor type 1 (CR1) expressed on erythrocytes of patients are reduced. In patients with SLE, anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) have been associated with positive results on direct antiglobulin tests. Because of these findings, we investigated whether the reduced expression of erythrocyte CR1 in 61 patients (53 with SLE and 8 with the antiphospholipid syndrome) might be associated with the presence of aCL. A negative correlation was observed between aCL levels and mean numbers of CR1 (rs = -0.43, P = 0.001), and a positive correlation was observed between aCL levels and the levels of erythrocyte C4d and C3d (rs = 0.33 and 0.41, P = 0.01 and 0.001, respectively), but no correlation of aCL levels with serum C4 levels was found. When the results were further analyzed according to the IgG or IgM class of aCL, levels of antibodies of both classes were negatively correlated with CR1 numbers, but only IgM aCL levels were correlated with erythrocyte C4d and C3d numbers. The levels of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies showed no correlation with erythrocyte CR1, C4d, or C3d numbers but were negatively correlated with serum C4 levels (rs = -0.43, P = 0.002). These data suggest that aCL, or a closely related antibody specificity, may bind to erythrocytes and may be directly involved in the mechanism for reduction of erythrocyte CR1 expression in SLE patients.\r"

The threshold levels of IL-1 required for initiating these effects were different, and IL-1 was 10 times more potent in inhibiting synthesis than in stimulating breakdown of proteoglycan. Kinetic studies indicated that the effects on proteoglycan metabolism occurred earlier (16-24 hours) than those for PGE2 release (48 hours). Selective effects were observed with inhibitors. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs blocked PGE2 production in response to IL-1, but had no effect on proteoglycan metabolism, and the antiarthritic drugs that blocked IL-1-stimulated breakdown augmented the inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis. We suggest that the effects of IL-1 on proteoglycan breakdown, proteoglycan synthesis, and PGE2 release are mediated by independent post-receptor mechanisms.\r"

Etomidate 1-mg bolus and 2-mg h-1 infusion, Althesin 3-mg bolus and 14.5-mg h-1 infusion and propofol 3.3-mg bolus and 3.3-mg h-1 were given via a tail vein cannula and pentobarbitone 50 mg kg-1 was given by the intraperitoneal route, to groups of six rats. Each animal received only one anaesthetic agent. One hour after cannulation of the common bile duct, 131I-cholylgly.tyr. 5 microCi was injected into the jugular vein and bile was collected every 1 min for 10 min. The mean (SD) percentage cumulative biliary excretion of 131I-cholylgly.tyr. at the end of 10 min was: propofol group 74.1 (5.2)%; Althesin group 82.3 (2.2)%; etomidate group 69.4 (17.6)%; pentobarbitone group 76.4 (3.2)%. Propofol and Althesin were relatively more choleretic, causing bile flow rates twice that produced by pentobarbitone. Only Althesin caused a significant increase in biliary excretion of 131I-cholylgly.tyr. relative to that in rats that received pentobarbitone. Bile flow rates for the respective anaesthetic techniques (microliter min-1/100 g body weight) (mean (SD)) were: propofol group 14.1 (1.8); Althesin group 12.5 (1.7); etomidate 8.5 (1.4); pentobarbitone group 7.3 (1.0). There was a marked metabolic acidosis in all rats except in the propofol group, in which normal acid-base status and oxygenation were observed.\r"

In 114 specimens lung phospholipids extracted from amniotic fluid were also assayed using two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. Urogastrone concentrations became measurable at approximately 30 weeks gestation and thereafter there was a 10-fold rise in concentrations between 30 and 40 weeks gestation. This increase in urogastrone concentration was positively correlated with a rise in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol concentrations and the phosphatidylcholine (lecithin)/sphingomyelin ratio (L/S). These results are compatible with a role for urogastrone in human fetal lung maturation.\r"

An estimated 5500 people in The Gambia require cataract surgery, 4600 eyelid surgery for entropion, and 4600 people spectacles to correct a refractive error which causes a visual acuity of less than 6/18.

These results demonstrate that the two proteins share epitope homology. Microculture bioassays indicate that neoplastic and normal 60-Kd proteins are capable of driving neoplastic B cells through S-phase. Western immunoblot analysis indicates that neoplastic B cells secrete 60- as well as 14-Kd protein. Immunoaffinity-purified proteins secreted by Br cells exhibit BCGF activity in anti-IgM or dextran sulfate-preactivated human B cells. In addition, a double-antibody immunofluorescence staining technique was used to demonstrate that Br cells express cell surface receptors for BCGF molecule(s). These studies provide support for the autocrine growth model for neoplastic human B cells and suggest that the autocrine growth factor derived from such tumor cells is similar if not identical to normal BCGF molecules.\r"

However, with appropriate assays, we demonstrate that IL-3 increases the size of G-CSF-induced granulocytic colonies; these colonies contain greater proportions of immature cells as compared with colonies stimulated by G-CSF alone. Furthermore, IL-3 promotes the survival of CFU-G in vitro, whereas in cultures not supplemented with IL-3, CFU-G extinguish within seven days. We conclude that IL-3, although it does not stimulate granulocytic colony formation by itself, regulates the survival and proliferative rate of granulocytic progenitors.\r"

Isolated B cells were incubated up to six days with various concentrations of rTNF-alpha (0.1 to 100 ng/mL). B cells from most patients proliferated ranged from two to 104 times that of unstimulated cells from the same patients. An optimal proliferative effect was achieved at 25 ng/mL rTNF-alpha and an incubation time between 96 and 120 hours, whereas a low concentration of rTNF-alpha (1 ng/mL) reduced [3H]TdR incorporation in four cases. Metaphase cells were detected in the rTNF-alpha-stimulated cultures that proliferated in response to rTNF-alpha. B cells from three of ten patients proliferated spontaneously and proliferation was further enhanced in two patients by rTNF-alpha. TNF binding assays gave a value of approximately 390 to 1,400 binding sites/cell for TNF and a dissociation constant (kd) of approximately 60 pmol/L.

  ".W": "Pretreatment blast cells from 739 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were immunophenotyped as part of a prospective treatment protocol study. Among 192 patients (26%) with T lineage ALL, 47 (6%; 24% of T lineage ALL) had lymphoblasts without sheep erythrocyte rosette formation, but with pan-T antigen CD7 on the membrane and intracellular CD3 proteins mostly in perinuclear accumulation. The T-cell surface antigens CD5 and/or CD2 and focal acid phosphatase were additional markers of this subgroup traditionally called pre-T ALL, whereas thymocyte antigen CD1 as well as CD4 and CD8 antigens were not expressed. Hematopoietic progenitor cell markers, namely terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and in part common ALL antigen (CD10), HLA-DR antigens, and/or My-10 (CD34), a unique antigen of marrow cells absent in thymus cells, further characterized this immature T-ALL form of putative prothymocytic phenotype (CD7+/intracellular CD3+/TdT+/My-10+/-/HLA-DR+/-/CD10+/-). The prethymic T cell character was supported by germ-line T-cell receptor beta genes found in 21 of 36 patients analyzed. In five cases only T gamma-chain genes were rearranged. Fifteen patients, however, had rearrangements of both T beta and T gamma genes. Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were rearranged only in two cases. Pre-T ALL differed significantly from E-rosette+ T-ALL in some presenting clinical features, namely mediastinal mass, lymphoadenopathy, and platelet count, and independently of clinical factors in prognosis (P = .02, median remission duration: 15.7 v 33.5 months, and P = .02, median survival time: 24.6 v 50.7 months). We conclude that ALL classification based solely on T- or B-cell lineage affiliation is not sufficient but needs further subdivision according to relevant maturation stages as exemplified here within the T-cell axis. The putative prethymic T cell progenitor phenotype described might help elucidate the sequence of genetic events that commit normal hematopoietic cells to the T-cell lineage.\r"

  ".W": "We have proposed that the blasts in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) are renewal populations maintained by a small subpopulation of stem cells. The balance between self-renewal and differentiation in blast stem cells may be an important attribute contributing to treatment outcome. Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) is included in most chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of AML. When ara-C survival curves are constructed, the drug appears to be more toxic when an assay is used that detects principally self-renewing divisions, compared with a procedure that depends on terminal divisions. AML blasts usually respond in culture to myelopoietic growth factors; their response often includes a change in self-renewal, differentiation, or both. These features of the model for AML blasts led to the prediction that growth factors would alter ara-C survival curves in a way that depended on the effects of the culture conditions on self-renewal and differentiation. Four AML blast populations were chosen to test this prediction on the basis of our ability to manipulate them by adding or withholding one or more growth factors. Highly significant changes were seen in the ara-C survival curves, depending on the growth factors present in the cultures as was predicted by the observed effects of the factors on renewal and differentiation.\r"

IL-6 gene expression was investigated in fresh human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by Northern blot analysis using a specific cDNA probe. 1.3-kb IL-6 transcript was found in six out of 11 B-CLL patients, while no hybridization was observed in ten cases of ALL of both T- and B-cell origin. The constitutive expression of IL-6 transcripts was associated with production of a biologically active protein as determined by using the IL-6-dependent 7TD1 cell line. It remains to be elucidated whether IL-6 gene expression is indeed important in the regulation of B-CLL growth or in its clinical manifestation.\r"

This cellular population is clonal at the molecular level, but is phenotypically heterogeneous, with CD4+CD8+ and CD4-CD8+ cells. Although these cells do not divide in the peripheral blood, a majority of them are found in G1 phase and express the membrane antigen 4F2, a very early marker of activation. Many similarities are found between this nonmalignant AT clone and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia at the morphologic, cytogenetic, and immunologic levels, despite the different clinical courses associated with these proliferations. We hypothesize that the t(14;14) translocation is linked to the abnormal morphology and immunophenotype of the AT clone cells, but that this translocation confers only a preactivated state to the cells. A complete malignant transformation would then be due to secondary events.\r"

  ".U": "89194382\r", 
  ".W": "Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is known to reversibly increase the cation permeability of a variety of freshly isolated and cultured cell types. In this study the effects of extracellular ATP were studied using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) isolated from both normal subjects and from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Changes in the permeability to Na+, Rb+, and Li+ ions were measured using conventional isotope and flame photometry techniques. In addition, changes in cytosolic (Ca2+) were fluorimetrically monitored to assess possible changes in net Ca2+ influx. ATP produced a 12-fold increase in 22Na+ influx into CLL cells but only a 3.5-fold increase in this flux in PBL cells. A maximal response was produced by 0.1 mmol/L ATP in the absence of Mg2+, while a twofold molar excess of Mg2+ over ATP abolished the response. ATP had no effect on the passive (ouabain-insensitive) 86Rb+ influx into PBL cells but stimulated this flux by fivefold in the CLL cells. Li+ influx into CLL cells was also stimulated threefold by ATP. Under these same conditions ATP also produced a net increase in total cell Na and a decrease in total cell K in the CLL cells. Exclusion of two normally impermeable dyes, trypan blue and ethidium bromide, was not altered in the ATP-treated CLL cells. Finally, extracellular ATP (3 mmol/L) produced no significant change in the cytosolic (Ca2+) of normal, monocyte-depleted populations of PBL. Conversely, this same concentration of ATP produced a very rapid (complete within 30 seconds) and a significant (an average threefold peak change) increase in the cytosolic (Ca2+) of cell preparations derived from five out of nine CLL patients. In these latter CLL cells, the ATP-induced elevation in cytosolic (Ca2+) appeared to be due to a net increase in Ca2+ influx, since no elevations were observed when the extracellular (Ca2+) was reduced to less than 0.1 mmol/L. These actions of ATP were specific in that equimolar concentrations of other nucleotides were without effect. These data indicate that treatment of CLL lymphocytes with extracellular ATP4 produces large increases in cation permeability. In contrast, there is less or no ATP-induced permeabilization of normal PBL.\r"

Sixteen of 28 patients (57%) showed a normal number of circulating B-lymphocytes, as demonstrated by the low percentage of mouse rosette-forming cells (M-RFC), surface immunoglobulins (SIg), and CD24-positive cells. Clinically, a lower number of relapses occurred in this group of patients compared to those with a persistent expansion of peripheral B-cells (P less than 0.05). In order to assess monoclonality of the residual peripheral B-cell population, the distribution of SIg light chains was investigated on the B-cell-enriched fraction of 15 of these 16 cases. Only six of them had a kappa/lambda ratio which ranged between 1.7:1 and 3:1, whereas the remaining patients still displayed a clearly imbalanced kappa/lambda Ig light chain distribution. On the other hand, the analysis of the configuration of the Ig heavy chain gene region, performed in nine cases (including five of the above six cases), showed the persistence of a rearranged pattern in all cases tested but one. Therefore, residual monoclonal B-cells were found also in the majority of cases which displayed the lowest kappa/lambda ratio, a normal bone marrow lymphocytosis and a long-lasting clinical remission. Studies at the DNA level confirm that a remission is rarely achieved in this disease in spite of intensive and prolonged chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the follow-up of B-CLL patients by conventional immunologic markers may be helpful to better define response to therapy and to predict the occurrence of clinical relapse.\r"

Severe constitutional symptoms were seen in the first five patients who received rIFN-gamma as a 2- to 4-hour intravenous infusion, and this method of administration was therefore abandoned. One transient partial tumor regression was observed in the 31 patients who received treatment by the intramuscular route of administration. Although a clinically tolerable regimen suitable for outpatient administration was developed, rIFN-gamma given in this dose and schedule had minimal antitumor effect for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. NK activity was depressed within 48 hours of rIFN-gamma administration but became significantly higher than normal controls or pretreatment levels during therapy despite disease progression, indicating discordance between augmentation of this immune parameter and tumor status. Serum CA 19-9 levels were unusually high and increased significantly more than CA 125 or CEA during rIFN-gamma treatment. This observation suggests that rIFN-gamma could augment localization of anti-CA 19-9 used to diagnostically image or therapeutically target a labeled chemotherapy agent to tumor in those patients expressing this antigen.\r"

An immunohistochemical study of ras p21 expression was carried out on paraffin sections of 54 human breast carcinomas using monoclonal antibodies to p21. The control group consisted of ten cases of benign fibrocystic disease. The p21 expression was significantly higher in cancer cells than in epithelial cells of control specimens. No correlations, however, were observed between oncogene product expression and tumor size, histologic type, or grade. As a group, tumors with axillary lymph node metastases expressed higher levels of ras p21 than nonmetastasizing tumors. However, because of the significant overlap in individual p21 values, it is unlikely that the immunohistochemical assay for p21 could be used to predict the behavior of mammary carcinomas.\r"

The authors report the first case of fatality occurring during the active phase of Kikuchi's disease. The 38-year-old patient presented with fever and generalized lymphadenopathy. During hospitalization, he developed abrupt onset of heart failure and died. Postmortem examination revealed enlarged lymph nodes all over the body showing typical histologic changes of Kikuchi's disease, but there was no encroachment on vital structures. The heart was dilated and flabby, with multiple microscopic foci of necrosis and mild fatty change. There were no other significant findings, and all cultures were negative. The authors speculate that large amounts of cytokines produced by the histiocytes or high endogenous catecholamines resulting from the stress response might be responsible for the myocardial damage. Alternatively, infection by an as yet uncharacterized microbial might be the underlying cause for both the lymphadenitis and myocardial disease.\r"

  ".W": "Increased gastric acid secretion, enhanced acid delivery to the duodenum, and reduced alkaline secretion in the proximal duodenum are relatively well-established pathophysiologic abnormalities in duodenal ulcer. Impaired duodenal motility, however, may also contribute to duodenal ulceration by altering the distribution of acid and alkaline secretions along the upper digestive tract. We tested the hypothesis that the duodenal ulcerogens cysteamine, MPTP, and mepirizole modify duodenal motility in the rat and that motility changes might be a common and early alteration in experimental duodenal ulceration. All three duodenal ulcerogens rapidly produced extensive changes in duodenal myoelectric activity and reduced the frequency of myoelectric slow waves. Cysteamine induced marked hypermotility for at least 6 hr; MPTP rapidly decreased motility and fragmented the myoelectric migrating pattern. Mepirizole induced biphasic changes: an early hypermotility phase of about 30 min was followed by profound hypomotility. These results indicate that marked alterations of duodenal motility are common during experimental duodenal ulceration. In light of the differential effect of the ulcerogens on duodenal motility, it remains to be determined how these changes influence acid neutralization in the proximal duodenum. Nevertheless, our results suggest that all three duodenal ulcerogens, which are different in structure, alter duodenal motility.\r"

In our present study, these data were used to examine the epidemiology of constipation. Since NDTI statistics are available for a longer time period than other U.S. statistics, they might confirm or disprove the relevance of recent environmental changes on the occurrence of this disorder. The average number of physician visits for constipation in the United States was 2.5 million per year, corresponding to a prevalence of 1.2%. The largest number of these patients (31%) was seen by general and family practitioners, followed in declining order by internists (20%) and pediatricians (15%). Only 4% of all these patients was seen by gastroenterologists. Eight-five percent of these patients received a prescription for medication, with laxatives and cathartics being the most frequently prescribed drugs. Among physician visits for constipation, female prevalence was 1.6% compared with 0.8% for males (P less than 0.001). In both sexes, there was a significant age-related increase in the rate of physician visits, with the steepest rise from 1.3% to 4.1% occurring between the age groups 60-64 and over 65. From 1958 to 1986, the rate of all physician visits for constipation remained unchanged. However, during this time period, there was a twofold rise in physician visits for those patients ages 0-9 years, while a smooth decline occurred in all of the older age groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subsequently, using a single-pass perfusion technique, we observed an immediate dose-dependent secretion of water by the rat colon upon intravenous administration of CGRP.

However, there are few controlled or comparative data on different sclerosing agents for treatment of lesions with active arterial bleeding or nonbleeding visible vessels. In a controlled, randomized study of canine small bowel arteries our purposes were (a) to evaluate the efficacy for arterial coagulation of six sclerosing agents compared with normal saline control, (b) to compare the resultant tissue injury of agents, and (c) to elucidate the possible mechanisms of arterial coagulation and tissue injury of the agents. The agents evaluated were (a) 98% ethanol, (b) TES, a mixture with final concentration of 1% tetradecyl sulfate, 32% ethanol, and 0.3 normal saline, (c) 1% polidocanol (Ethoxysclerol), (d) 1:10,000 epinephrine, (e) 7.2% hypertonic saline, (f) 3.6% hypertonic saline, and (g) 0.9% saline (normal saline control). Agents were injected from the mucosal side of the small bowel into and around the pentrating serosal arteries in the subserosal space. Ethanol and TES were the most effective agents for arterial coagulation. Polidocanol was less effective than ethanol and TES. However, it was the only other agent that induced significant arterial coagulation. Alcohol and TES also caused significant injury in surrounding tissue. The degree of this injury was dependent on the total volume injected. Epinephrine induced significant mucosal damage without significant serosal injury or arterial coagulation. The coagulation and tissue injury effects of hypertonic saline injections were not significantly different from normal saline control.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of the pancreatic dual-label Schilling test as an indirect test of pancreatic exocrine function was evaluated. This dual-label Schilling test was based on the difference of absorption for [58Co]cobalamin bound to hog R protein and [57Co]cobalamin bound to intrinsic factor. In this study, the test was performed in 7 normal subjects, 5 patients with pancreatectomy, 12 patients with chronic pancreatitis, 10 patients with suspicion of chronic pancreatitis, and 13 patients without chronic pancreatitis. The normal lower limit (mean -2 SD) of excretion ratio for [58Co]/[57Co] in 24-h urine was 0.68. Of the 26 patients on whom endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed, none of the 9 patients with normal pancreatogram, 4 of the 9 patients with mild to moderate pancreatitic changes in pancreatogram, and 7 of the 8 patients with advanced pancreatitic changes in pancreatogram showed a positive value lower than the ratio of 0.68 in this test. In 28 patients examined with the direct test of pancreatic secretory capacity, 2 of the 13 patients with normal function, 6 of the 9 patients with mild dysfunction, and 5 of the 6 patients with definite dysfunction were positive in this test. The results of the pancreatic dual-label Schilling test significantly correlated with those of a direct test of pancreatic secretory capacity and the findings of pancreatitic changes in pancreatogram (p less than 0.01, chi 2 test). The ratio for [58Co]/[57Co] correlated (r = 0.73) with the maximal bicarbonate concentration in duodenal juice of the direct test of pancreatic secretory capacity. The impairment of bicarbonate output by the pancreas may adversely affect the transfer of cobalamin from R protein to intrinsic factor. It suggested that the pancreatic dual-label Schilling test is useful for detecting not only patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency but also the relatively early stage of chronic pancreatitis with bicarbonate secretory dysfunction of the pancreas.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty of 81 consecutive HIV antibody positive patients referred with non-cryptosporidial diarrhoea had no potential infectious cause; most had AIDS related complex rather than the full blown syndrome. Opportunistic infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV), mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI), and herpes simplex virus (HSV), which allowed a diagnosis of AIDS to be made, were found in 19 patients and were the presenting features of AIDS in five. Other potential pathogenic species included entamoeba, giardia, campylobacter, and salmonella (without septicaemia). Cytomegalovirus infection was often accompanied by abdominal pain. Severe weight loss (greater than 10 kg) at presentation was found in patients with CMV infection and MAI. Bloody diarrhoea was confined to the group with HSV procitis. Malignant causes of diarrhoea were rare. Two patients developed a squamous carcinoma of the anorectal margin and one a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In only two of 12 patients who had Kaposi's sarcoma was this considered as a cause of diarrhoea. Rigid sigmoidoscopy showed macroscopic abnormalities in over a third (32) of the 81 patients with non-cryptosporidial diarrhoea. Most commonly this was severe inflammation (17) or discrete ulceration (four) [three of whom had CMV colitis]. Kaposi's sarcoma was identified in 11 patients. Non-specific inflammation was seen histologically in 40 of the 60 patients with no sigmoidoscopic inflammatory changes. Barium enema only revealed an abnormality in a minority of the patients and a colonoscopy only revealed information additional to rigid sigmoidoscopy in two patients--one with CMV ulcers in the transverse colon and the other with evidence of Kaposi's sarcoma not seen in the rectum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89198065\r", 
  ".W": "alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency is a hereditary disorder associated with reduced serum alpha 1AT levels and the development of pulmonary emphysema. An alpha 1AT gene is defined as \"Null\" when no alpha 1AT in serum is attributed to that alpha 1AT gene. Although all alpha 1AT Null genes have identical phenotypic consequences (i.e. no detectable alpha 1AT in the serum), different genotypic mechanisms can cause the Null state. This study defines the molecular basis for the alpha 1AT gene Nullmattawa, identified and cloned from genomic DNA of an individual with the Null-Null phenotype and emphysema resulting from the heterozygous inheritance of the Nullmattawa and Nullbellingham genes. Sequencing of exons Ic-V and all exon-intron junctions of the Nullmattawa gene demonstrated it was identical to the common normal M1(Val213) alpha 1AT gene except for the insertion of a single nucleotide within the coding region of exon V, causing a 3' frameshift with generation of a premature stop signal. Family analysis using oligonucleotide probes specific for the Nullmattawa sequence demonstrated the gene was inherited in an autosomal fashion. Examination of blood monocytes demonstrated that a normal-sized, 1.8-kb alpha 1AT mRNA transcript is associated with the Nullmattawa gene and in vitro translation of mRNA with the Nullmattawa mutation showed it translated at a normal rate but produced a truncated alpha 1AT protein. Additionally, retroviral transfer of the alpha 1AT Nullmattawa cDNA to murine fibroblasts demonstrated no detectable intracellular or secreted alpha 1AT, despite the presence of alpha 1AT Nullmattawa mRNA transcripts. These findings are consistent with the concept that the molecular pathophysiology of Nullmattawa is likely manifested at a posttranslational level. The identification of the Nullmattawa gene supports the concept that Null alpha 1AT alleles represent a heterogenous group in which very different mechanisms cause the identical phenotypic state.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating alpha 1-antitrypsin is synthesized primarily in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream, where it serves as the major protease inhibitor. The PiZ variant of alpha 1-antitrypsin is associated with decreased levels of the protein in sera as a result of its retention within hepatocytes. Homozygosity for the variant allele predisposes individuals to the development of pulmonary emphysema and an increased risk for liver disease. We and others have previously demonstrated that the normal PiM human alpha 1-antitrypsin gene can be properly expressed in the livers of transgenic mice. The PiZ variant of the human alpha 1-antitrypsin gene was introduced into the germline of mice to determine whether the mutant protein would accumulate in mouse hepatocytes and if such accumulation would result in the development of liver damage in an animal model. As expected, the mutant human protein was abundantly synthesized in the livers of the transgenic animals and accumulated within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes as it does in human patients. PiZ mice developed significantly more liver necrosis and inflammation than PiM transgenic mice or control littermates. The degree of liver damage was correlated with the amount of PiZ alpha 1-antitrypsin accumulated in the liver of the different pedigrees of mice. Although 40% of PiZ mice tested were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the degree of liver damage was not influenced by the MHV seropositivity; rather, it was related only to the presence of accumulated PiZ protein.\r"

  ".W": "Exuberant tumor-like synovial cell proliferation with invasion of periarticular bone is a feature of rheumatoid arthritis in humans and of streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced arthritis in rats. These histologic observations prompted us to examine synoviocytes from arthritic joints for phenotypic characteristics of transformed cells. The capacity to grow in vitro under anchorage-independent conditions is a characteristic that correlates closely with potential in vivo tumorigenicity. In medium supplemented with 20% serum or in basal media supplemented with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), early passage synoviocytes from both SCW-induced and rheumatoid arthritic joints formed colonies in soft agarose. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) did not support growth, although EGF enhanced PDGF-dependent growth. On the other hand, TGF-beta, as well as all-trans-retinoic acid, inhibited colony growth. Early passage normal rat and human synoviocytes also grew under the same conditions, but lung, skin, and late-gestation embryonic fibroblast-like cells did not. Considered in the context of other published data our findings provide cogent evidence that synoviocytes, but not other types of fibroblast-like cells, readily acquire phenotypic characteristics commonly associated with transformed cells. Expression of the transformed phenotype in the inflammatory site is likely regulated by paracrine growth factors, such as PDGF and TGF-beta.\r"

  ".W": "Using probes recognizing variable regions (V gamma) and joining regions (J gamma) of the T cell receptor (TCR) gamma gene, we have analyzed the usage of V gamma genes in 24 patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 36 patients with B-precursor ALL. In CD3- T-ALL derived from immature T cells, V gamma genes more proximal to J gamma were frequently rearranged; V gamma 8, V gamma 9, V gamma 10, and V gamma 11 were used in 19 of 24 rearrangements. In contrast, CD3+ T-ALL derived from a more mature stage of T cell ontogeny, showed a high frequency of rearrangements involving V gamma genes distal to J gamma; V gamma 2, V gamma 3, V gamma 4, and V gamma 5 were used in 17 of 25 rearrangements. In B-precursor ALL, no notable bias of V gamma gene usage was observed. This probably reflects the possibility that TCR genes may not rearrange according to a T cell hierarchy when under control of a B cell gene program. Furthermore, deletions of those V gamma genes located 3' to rearranged V gamma genes were observed in all patients analyzed. This supports the theory that loop deletion is a major mechanism for TCR-gamma gene rearrangement.\r"

A form of Ro(SSA) is described in red blood cells that shares a line of identity with purified Ro(SSA) from bovine spleen and human lymphocytes in counterimmunoelectrophoresis, but has different molecular properties. Ro(SSA) from red blood cells exists in association with only two small RNAs as opposed to four in other cell types, as determined by RNA extraction of protein A-assisted immunoprecipitates. In addition to the common 60-kD Ro(SSA) protein, Western blot analysis revealed an additional 52-kD protein in lymphocytes and a 54-kD protein in red blood cells. The 60-kD form of Ro(SSA) in red cells was found to be antigenically distinct from that in the lymphocyte, because sera were identified that bound each exclusively. Finally, a rabbit antibovine Ro(SSA) serum distinguished red cell from lymphocyte Ro(SSA). These results suggest two distinctive populations of Ro(SSA) proteins and distributions of Ro(SSA) RNAs in the lymphocyte and red blood cell.\r"

  ".U": "89198091\r", 
  ".W": "An almost universal side effect of long-term therapy with procainamide is the appearance of serum autoantibodies and less frequently a syndrome resembling lupus erythematosus. Previous studies demonstrated that procainamide-hydroxylamine (PAHA), a metabolite generated by hepatic mixed function oxidases, was highly toxic to dividing cells, but evidence that PAHA could be formed in the circulation was lacking. This study examines the capacity of neutrophils to metabolize procainamide to reactive forms. Neutrophils activated with opsonized zymosan were cytotoxic only if procainamide was present, whereas N-acetyl procainamide, which does not induce autoimmunity, was inert in this bioassay. PAHA was detected by HPLC in the extracellular medium if ascorbic acid was present. Generation of PAHA and cytotoxic procainamide metabolites was inhibited by NaN3 and catalase but not by superoxide dismutase, indicating that H2O2 and myeloperoxidase were involved. Nonactivated neutrophils and neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease did not generate cytotoxic PAHA, demonstrating that H2O2 was derived from the respiratory burst accompanying neutrophil activation. These conclusions were supported by results of a cell-free system in which neutrophils were replaced by myeloperoxidase and H2O2 or an H2O2 generating system. These studies demonstrate the capacity of neutrophils to mediate metabolism of procainamide and establish the role of myeloperoxidase released during degranulation and H2O2 derived from the respiratory burst in the direct cooxidation of procainamide to PAHA. The profound biologic activity of this metabolite and its possible generation within lymphoid compartments implicate this process in the induction of autoimmunity by procainamide.\r"

In this study, we present evidence to suggest that excessive polyamines can contribute to the IL 2 deficiency in RA. Blocking polyamine production with inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase results in increased IL 2 production by RA PBMC. Moreover, polyamine oxidase (PAO) inhibitors and catalase also increase IL 2 production by RA PBMC. This effect of PAO inhibition is monocyte mediated. After 3 d in culture, RA PBMC produce three times more IL 2 than do normal PBMC. This rise is prevented by exogenous spermidine but only in the presence of monocytes. The concentration of polyamines in RA PBMC and synovial fluid MNC is 2-20-fold higher than in normal cells. Thus, polyamines and their oxidation products downregulate IL 2 production by RA PBMC and may account for the decreased T cell effector function seen in this disease.\r"

In W/Wv mice reconstituted with mast cells by intravenous administration of bone marrow cells derived from congenic +/+ mice (+/+ BM----W/Wv mice), anti-IgE induced extensive mast cell degranulation, as well as pathophysiological responses and mortality similar to those observed in WBB6F1-+/+ mice.

In adult cardiac myocytes, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor number increases two- to threefold after 10 min of hypoxia, an increase similar to that seen during ischemia in vivo. To determine whether this increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor number leads to an enhanced synthesis of inositol trisphosphate, the intracellular second messenger for the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, the mass of inositol trisphosphate was quantified by a novel procedure developed in our laboratory that circumvents problems associated with using labeled precursors. The peak increases in inositol trisphosphate levels of three- to fourfold were measured after 30 s of norepinephrine stimulation and exhibited a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 7.9 x 10(-8) M. Hypoxia produced a marked leftward shift in the dose-response curve for the production of inositol trisphosphate in response to norepinephrine stimulation (EC50 = 1.2 x 10(-8) M). Hypoxia also induced a 100-fold reduction in the concentration of norepinephrine required to elicit a threshold increase in inositol trisphosphate (10(-9) M), compared with control normoxic myocytes (10(-7) M). Thus, hypoxia, which increases alpha 1-adrenergic receptor density, also leads to an enhanced production of inositol trisphosphate and could account for the enhanced alpha 1-adrenergic responsivity in the ischemic heart in vivo, which is known to facilitate arrhythmogenesis.\r"

Murine monoclonal antibodies, raised against synthetic peptides from these homologous regions, bound not only to the isolated peptides, but also to the native gp160 and class II molecules. In this study one-third of sera from HIV I-infected individuals, at different disease stages, were found to react with both the gp41 and class II-derived peptides. These sera also reacted with \"native\" HLA class II molecules. The potential affects of such autoantibodies on normal immune functions were examined. It was found that in the presence of class II-cross-reactive (but not control) sera, the proliferative responses of normal CD4+ T cells to tetanus toxoid and allogeneic stimuli were markedly decreased. In addition, these sera could eliminate class II-bearing cells by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Similar affects were seen with affinity-purified IgG antibodies from patients' sera. Thus, the \"molecular mimicry\" between HIV I and HLA class II antigens, may lead to the generation of autoantibodies in HIV I-infected individuals that may contribute to the early functional impairment of CD4+ T cell observed in many HIV I-infected individuals.\r"

The morphology of the signet ring vacuoles was identical to that found in the commoner B cell signet ring lymphoma of clear vacuole type, and it is suggested that the vacuoles derive from multivesicular bodies. The four cases reported so far have all presented with skin disease, and the limited evidence available suggests that the prognosis may be good.\r"

Immune blotting shows that the likely basis of this reactivity is a 12 kilodalton peptide which is recognised by both antibodies.

  ".W": "The strategy of placing prophylactic patches for the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) without the AICD was employed in 34 patients with coronary artery disease at risk for postoperative ventricular tachycardia undergoing coronary bypass graft surgery (12 patients) or subendocardial resection (22 patients). Patients were selected on the basis of the presence of preoperative sustained ventricular tachycardia (25 patients) or ventricular fibrillation (9 patients) and absence of control of the arrhythmia with 3.6 +/- 1.3 antiarrhythmic drugs by programmed stimulation. Patients having subendocardial resection were also selected on the basis of multiple configurations of ventricular tachycardia, inability to map the tachycardia or posterior wall aneurysm. The surgical mortality rate was 12%, with two deaths after coronary bypass graft surgery and two deaths after subendocardial resection. The AICD patches were removed in 1 of the 34 patients a few hours after surgery because of left atrial laceration and bleeding. Among 10 patients surviving coronary bypass surgery alone, ventricular arrhythmia was not inducible in 6 and in 4 it remained inducible postoperatively. One of the four patients with inducible arrhythmia had the AICD implanted with use of local anesthesia; the other three were treated with drugs. Among 20 patients surviving subendocardial resection, ventricular arrhythmia was noninducible in 15 and remained inducible in 5. Three of these five patients had an AICD implanted; the other two were treated with drugs. At 12 +/- 7 month follow-up, there were no late deaths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of the endothelium in response to aggregating platelets was examined in porcine coronary and peripheral (carotid, femoral and renal) arteries from normal and hypercholesterolemic pigs. Male Yorkshire pigs were fed either a normal diet or a 2% high cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In all arteries from control animals, aggregating platelets caused endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were augmented by ketanserin (a 5-HT2-serotonergic blocker), attenuated by apyrase (an adenosine diphosphatase and triphosphatase) or methiothepin (a combined 5-HT1 and 5-HT2-serotonergic blocker) and were almost abolished by a combination of apyrase and methiothepin. The platelet-induced relaxations were most pronounced in the coronary arteries. Adenosine diphosphate caused endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were significantly attenuated by apyrase. Serotonin also caused endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were significantly attenuated by methiothepin but augmented by ketanserin. The endothelium-dependent relaxations to adenosine diphosphate were most pronounced in coronary arteries and those to serotonin in coronary and renal arteries. In cholesterol-fed animals, the endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets, adenosine diphosphate and serotonin were impaired in all four arteries. These experiments indicate that 1) the endothelium exerts inhibitory effects against aggregating platelets in porcine coronary and peripheral arteries; 2) platelet-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations are achieved by purinergic and 5-HT1-serotonergic receptors on the endothelium; and 3) hypercholesterolemia reduces the endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets in a generalized manner because it impairs the relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and serotonin released from the platelets.\r"

HBV surface antibodies (Anti-HBs) were present in 6/85 (7.1%) paramedics of whom one (1.2%) had reactive HBV core antibodies (Anti-HBc). No paramedic had HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Seropositivity was not associated with duration of employment, or exposure to a patient with either jaundice (28.2%) or confirmed hepatitis B (20.0%) within the six months prior to testing. The 7.1% prevalence of HBV markers found in this group of suburban paramedics is intermediate between previously reported rates for urban paramedics. We conclude that prehospital personnel do not constitute a homogenous occupational category at risk for hepatitis B infection.\r"

  ".U": "89198496\r", 
  ".W": "CD4+ T cells have been recently divided into two subsets. The functions of these subsets are thought to be distinct: one subset (Th1) is responsible for delayed type hypersensitivity responses and another (Th2) is primarily responsible for induction of antibody synthesis. To more precisely define the roles of both subsets in humoral immune responses, we examined the ability of a panel of nominal antigen specific Th1 and Th2 clones to induce anti-TNP specific antibody synthesis in TNP-primed or unprimed B cells. Four of nine Th1 clones induced little or no antibody synthesis with TNP-primed B cells. However, five other Th1 clones were very effective at inducing IgG anti-TNP plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses in primed B cells. One of these Th1 clones was analysed in detail and found to also provide helper function for unprimed B cells. Cognate B-T cell interaction was required for induction of both primary and secondary responses with this clone, indicating that a Th1 clone could function as a \"classical\" Th cell. The seven IL-4 producing Th2 clones examined were also heterogeneous in their ability to induce antibody secretion by TNP-primed B cells. Although four of the Th2 clones induced IgG and IgM anti-TNP PFC responses, two Th2 clones induced only IgM and no IgG antibody, and another clone failed to induce any anti-TNP PFC. All Th2 clones failed to induce any anti-TNP PFC. All Th2 clones produced high levels of IL-4, but \"helper\" Th2 clones produced significantly greater amounts of IL-5 than \"non-helper\" Th2 clones. These studies indicate that some IL-2- and some IL-4-producing T cell clones can induce TNP-specific antibody in cell clones can induce TNP-specific antibody in primed and unprimed B cells, and that Th1 and Th2 clones are heterogeneous in their ability to induce Ig synthesis. Therefore, although T cell clones can be classified as Th1 or Th2 types according to patterns of IL-2, IFN-gamma, or IL-4 synthesis, the functional capacity to induce antibody synthesis cannot be predicted solely by their ability to secrete these lymphokines.\r"

  ".U": "89198497\r", 
  ".W": "A study was carried out on cord blood T cell activation via the CD2-mediated pathway. Despite similar percentages of circulating CD3+ and CD2+ cells in adult and cord blood, the proliferation of cord PBMC to the anti-CD3 mAb and cord T cells to anti-CD2 mAb were defective. The T cell CD3-surface structure was normally able to control CD2-mediated activation, as its modulation by a non-mitogenic anti-CD3 mAb blocked cord PBMC proliferation induced by anti-CD2 mAb. CD2-stimulated cord T cells did not proliferate and did not produce a significant amount of IL-2 in culture, although they expressed the IL-2R. This observation was confirmed by the optimal proliferation of CD2-induced cord T cells when rIL-2 was added. Despite the alternative T cell activation pathway is monocyte-independent in adults, the defective cord T cell activation via the CD2 molecule could also be bypassed by the addition of PMA, small amounts of either autologous or allogeneic adult and cord AC or simply rIL-1 alone. Our findings provide evidence for an intrinsic functional defect in cord CD2-mediated T cell activation, which is linked to an impaired increase of free cytoplasmic calcium, as confirmed by the effectiveness of calcium ionophore A23187 in restoring a good CD2-induced cord T cell proliferation and by measurement of cellular calcium uptake after activation via the CD2 molecule. The characteristics of cord T cells revealed by this study recall the thymocyte functional pattern and may represent functional expression of the previously described phenotypic immaturity of cord T cells.\r"

Unlike receptors for growth factors such as IL-2 and transferrin, the Ta1 Ag is present on T cell lines and clones irrespective of cell cycle. The appearance of Ta1 on T cells that respond to recall Ag allowed us to investigate activation requirements that may be associated with T cell immune memory. Ta1+ peripheral blood T cells were induced to proliferate by mAb recognizing either the invariant chains of the TCR, or by pairs of mitogenic antibodies directed to the CD2 molecule. In contrast, Ta1- cells were not stimulated by these antibodies. In addition, Ta1-cells did not proliferate maximally after addition of the phorbol ester PMA in combination with the calcium ionophore Ionomycin, suggesting that the intracellular targets of these agents may not be fully active. Anti-CD3-induced elevation of intracellular calcium levels was equivalent in the two subpopulations, suggesting that calcium mobilization mechanisms were intact. In contrast, PMA-induced phosphorylation of TCR CD3 chains was significantly greater in Ta1+ cells as compared to Ta1- T cells. Taken together, our results indicate that Ta1 expression, which is associated with T cell activation and memory, may be causally related to TCR and CD2-mediated activation mechanisms. The PMA inducible TCR phosphorylation in Ta1+ memory cells associated with their increased ability to proliferate after CD3/TCR or CD2 stimulation suggests that intracellular phosphorylation events may be causally associated with T cell immune memory.\r"

The comparative activities of these peptides were tested in the following bioassays: 1) active induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 2) potentiation of EAE transfer activity by MBP- or peptide-sensitized lymph node cells (LNC), 3) in vitro proliferation of MBP- or peptide-sensitized LNC, and 4) in vitro proliferation of an encephalitogenic T cell line. The GP68-84 peptide exhibited potent activity in all four bioassays. In contrast, [A75]GP68-84 and [P80]GP68-84 exhibited a selective loss of certain activities while retaining activity in other bioassays. For example, LNC were activated by culture with [A75]GP68-84 to express potentiated EAE transfer activity. Furthermore, [A75]GP68-84 and GP68-84 were equipotent in stimulating the proliferation of the encephalitogenic T cell line. However, [A75]GP68-84 was virtually inactive in assays measuring the induction of EAE or the proliferation of either GPMBP- or [A75]GP68-84-sensitized LNC. Conversely, the [P80]GP68-84 peptide actively induced EAE and potentiated EAE cellular transfer activity but was incapable of stimulating proliferation of either GPMBP-sensitized LNC or an encephalitogenic T cell line. When [P80]GP68-84 was used for sensitization, in vitro proliferation of LNC was stimulated, but only by MBP sequences containing a P80 substitution. Overall, these results indicate that at least two structurally distinct T cell determinants of GP68-84 regulate functionally diverse encephalitogenic and proliferative activities of EAE-associated T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Presentation of Ag to type I CD4+ T cell clones by chemically fixed APC results in the induction of a long-lasting state of proliferative unresponsiveness in the T cell. Ag-specific TCR interactions do occur during this stimulation, as Ag- and Ia molecule-dependent increases in intracellular calcium free ion concentration can be demonstrated, yet free inositol phosphate generation is low and neither IL-2 synthesis nor proliferation occur. The addition of normal allogeneic accessory cells during this stimulation can restore the T cell proliferative response, as well as prevent the induction of unresponsiveness, thus defining an accessory cell-dependent costimulatory activity necessary for proliferation. We have now examined the biochemical effects of this costimulatory activity on early T cell activation. Normal accessory cell costimulatory activity was found to be incapable of augmenting the generation of free inositol phosphate in response to either fixed APC plus Ag or Con A alone. Furthermore, protein kinase C-dependent CD3 gamma-chain phosphorylation occurred in response to either fixed APC plus Ag or Con A alone, and the addition of normal accessory cells had no effect on the level of this phosphorylation. Finally, minimal CD3 zeta-chain tyrosine phosphorylation occurred during the induction of unresponsiveness with Ag and fixed APC alone and this also was not affected by the costimulatory activity. Our results demonstrate that T cell Ag receptor-mediated increases in intracellular calcium free ion concentration and protein kinase C activation occur independently of an accessory cell-derived costimulatory signal. In the absence of this costimulatory signal, these two intracellular second messengers are insufficient to induce a maximal proliferative response and in fact lead to a state of unresponsiveness.\r"

An Fc (Igh1-e)-specific syngeneic Th clone was cocultured in the presence of 2F10 anti-Id with 2F10-Fab-primed B cells. The Th clone responded with proliferation and also provided help for 2F10-Fab-primed B cells to produce antibodies that bind to L1210/GZL and not to P815 tumor cells. Intact 2F10 anti-Id was presented to Fc-specific Th cells by Fab (or Id) primed B cells more efficiently than the fragment mixture (Fab plus Fc) of 2F10 anti-Id, indicating that 2F10-Fab (or Id)-primed B cells capture 2F10 anti-Id through surface Ig receptors. Presenting B cells are sensitive to treatment with chloroquine and must come from H-2 matched mice, indicating that the Ag presentation by Fab-primed B cells to Fc-specific Th cells requires processing and is MHC restricted. Collectively these results outline a mechanism that may operate in anti-Id therapy of tumor-bearing animals by using tumor Ag mimicking anti-idiotypic antibodies. A similar mechanism could be effective in tumor patients immunized with xenogeneic anti-idiotypic antibodies operating under the \"intra(Ag) molecular help.\"\r"

Previous studies have proposed that this epitopic suppression is related to the induction of carrier-specific Ts cells which in turn could inhibit selectively anti-hapten response. In the present study, we propose that the epitopic suppression is in fact due to clonal dominance. Immunization with a carrier such as tetanus toxoid induces a clonal expansion of carrier-specific B cells, thus decreasing the probability of hapten-specific B cells to react with the Ag. Increasing the density of the TNP-hapten on the conjugate has totally prevented the induction of the epitopic suppression. Moreover, using low hapten-carrier concentrations to challenge carrier-primed mice has enhanced the induction of the suppression. Finally, priming hapten-specific B cells before carrier/hapten-carrier immunization has also abrogated the suppression. The results of these experiments support the view that epitopic suppression is induced through the expansion of the clones specific for the carrier epitopes and resulted from intra-molecular antigenic competition between hapten and carrier epitopes. Based on these findings a regulatory role is proposed for B cells, where through their capacity to process and present antigen, they would exercise a strong influence on the selection of immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "Females have better humoral immune responses and are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases than males. Normal female mice (C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and NZW) have significantly increased spontaneous autoimmune plaque-forming cells (APFC) to mouse erythrocytes pretreated with bromelain (Br-ME) in spleen, peritoneal exudate cell, and bone marrow compared to their male counterparts. A minor subpopulation of B cells, CD5+ B, is thought to produce this autoantibody. As determined by dual color flow cytometry, increased APFC to Br-ME in females is not due to quantitative increase of CD5+ B cells. Rather, it is due to increased numbers or percentages) of CD5+ B cells producing these autoantibodies, because CD5+ B cells from females produced greater numbers of APFC to Br-ME than equal numbers of cells derived from males. The increased autoantibody production in females can be attributed to the effect of estrogen on the immune response because this hormone markedly augments APFC to Br-ME in intact or orchidectomized males. Male hormone had little effect. Importantly, estrogen did not increase the numbers of B or CD5+ B cells but augmented the ability of B cells to produce this response. This was verified when a T cell-depleted B cell fraction or fluorescence-activated cell sorter purified CD5+ B cells from estrogen-treated mice proved more efficient in the production of APFC to Br-ME. These results suggest that the number of CD5+ B cells committed to produce autoantibodies to Br-ME is increased under the influence of estrogen. This is the first demonstration that estrogen can augment the production of natural autoantibodies in normal mice. The overall augmented humoral immune responses in females and the B cell hyperactivity in female predominant autoimmune diseases appears to be due to estrogen.\r"

  ".W": "A receptor for the Fc fragment of IgE has been described on human blood platelets. This receptor mediated the IgE-dependent stimulation of platelets by the specific allergen in Hymenoptera venom (HV) hypersensitivity. This platelet reactivity was abolished after rush desensitization. To understand the mechanism of such a down-regulation, we studied the effects of sera recovered from patients treated by HV rush desensitization on platelets of untreated HV sensitive patients. The present data describe the presence of a circulating factor able to suppress, in a dose-dependent manner, platelet stimulation by the specific allergen. This circulating factor was not allergen specific, not depleted by IgE or IgG antibody immunoadsorption, and was found at higher concentrations in the sera of patients receiving monthly high dosages of HV (200 micrograms maintenance dose). The physicochemical characterization showed that this circulating factor had a m.w. of 20,000 to 25,000, an isoelectric point of 4.2, was heat and acid stable, and sensitive to trypsin, but not to neuraminidase. These characteristics were similar to a newly described lymphokine, platelet activity suppressive lymphokine, suggesting the intervention of such a lymphokine in HV rush desensitization.\r"

  ".W": "Neurotensin, at less than or equal to 10(-9) M, in the presence of an optimal concentration of macrophage CSF (CSF-1), stimulated a dose-dependent enhancement of colony formation by murine marrow-derived mononuclear phagocyte progenitor cells. The additional colonies arose from the cell cycle and Ia Ag-positive subpopulation previously identified as two-signal-dependent progenitors. Two-signal colony formation diminished when the peptide was added at concentrations greater than 10(-9) M. Neurotensin binds specifically to two distinct receptors, a high affinity receptor (KD approximately 10(-9) M) and a lower affinity (KD approximately 10(-7) M) receptor identified as the tuftsin receptor. Rat liver ferritin and an inhibitory tuftsin analog. (ALA1)-tuftsin, which inhibit two-signal colony formation stimulated by tuftsin and tuftsin-like peptides in combination with CSF-1, did not inhibit colony formation stimulated by CSF-1 and 10(-9) M neurotensin. Both inhibitors, however, reversed the loss of two-signal colony growth in the presence of higher neurotensin concentrations. Neurotensin fragment 1-6, unlike ferritin and (ALA1)-tuftsin, inhibited two-signal colony formation stimulated by 10(-9) M neurotensin. However, like ferritin and (ALA1)-tuftsin, fragment 1-6 permitted full expression of two-signal colony formation in the presence of CSF-1 and 10(-7) M neurotensin. The data indicated that occupancy of both receptors at neurotensin concentrations greater than 10(-9) M might be responsible for the diminished progenitor response. The data further support a potential role for neurotensin as an inflammatory mediator. In addition to direct effects on mature phagocytic leukocytes, neurotensin, at least in vitro can influence the production of new mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

Based on this observation we have analyzed in the present study the correlation between the biological functions and the generation of different lymphokines in (T,G)-A--L specific CD4+ clones. One subset of clones--the \"helper clones\"--were found to provide help to primed B cells, in vitro. These cells could be shown to produce IL-1, IL-2, and B cell stimulatory factor 1 (IL-4) activities and to express mRNA encoding for these three cytokines. The second subset of clones, termed \"proliferative clones\", were unable to help B cells in vitro but expressed vigorous Ag-dependent proliferations. These cells did not express IL-1, IL-2, or IL-4 activities. They produced another lymphokine(s) which may be granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, or some other factor recognized by the HT2 cell line. This study further substantiates the link between T cell activities and lymphokine repertoire with a special emphasis on the potential role(s) of T cell-derived IL-1.\r"

  ".U": "89198519\r", 
  ".W": "The catalytic site for C4 of C1s has been presumed to consist of a C4-binding domain and a proteolytic domain. A mAb to C1s, M81, blocked C4 activation and C4 binding to C1s. M81 recognized the H chain of C1s. Using M81 as a probe, we tried to define C4-binding site on C1s. Plasmin digestion of C1s generated four products of Mr 58,000 (P1), 48,000 (P2), 37,000 (P3), and 27,000 (P4). These products, except for P2, all possessed a 26,000-Da H chain fragment (26k-HF) connected to variable-sized L chain pieces. 26k-HF alone had an ability to interact with M81. Amino-terminal amino acid analysis of 26k-HF mapped the epitope for M81 to domain IV and/or V of gamma-domain of C1s. The gamma-domain therefore contains the C4-binding site. The confirm and further elucidate the role of the C4-binding site for C4, we used a substrate-blotting technique in which labeled C4 was incubated with nitrocellulose membrane-fixed C1s and its fragments. C4 was successfully blotted onto C1s and P1, but not P2-P4; i.e., further degradation of the L chain led to the loss of C4-binding. During the incubation, most of the added C4 was converted to C4b. The binding was augmented, if the proteolytic activity of C1s and P1 was blocked, so that the added C4 remained intact. Although C4b also bound to C1s and P1, its binding was less effective and abolished by the addition of cold C4. Based on these results, the gamma-domain and the L chain constitute the catalytic site of C1s to activate C4 to C4b. Moreover, the generated C4b, although it still has weak affinity for C1s, can be replaced by newly coming C4.\r"

The mAb termed 1F4 (kappa-IgM) was reactive with rat T cells but not with B cells and immunohistochemically it stained rat thymus tissues strongly at medulla and weakly rat cortex. Addition of 1F4 mAb to a culture of T cells resulted in the proliferation of T cells by a help of PMA or a solid support. 1F4 mAb also caused the modulation of the corresponding Ag but not other T cell markers such as CD5, CD2, and OX-52-defined Ag. The 1F4 mAb immunoprecipitated a cell surface component having an apparent m.w. of 25,000 from rat T cells which could be associated with a disulfide-linked heterodimer (m.w. 92,000) consists of subunits having m.w. of about 52,000 and 43,000.

The protein specificity of 7 out of 37 stable T cell clones, which displayed MHC-restricted MV Ag recognition, could be assessed by using purified MV proteins. Two fusion (F) protein-specific, two hemagglutinin-specific, and three nucleoprotein- or matrix protein-specific clones were shown to be established. The F protein-specific T cell clones together with a panel of previously generated F protein-specific T cell clones were characterized for their fine specificity by using beta-galactosidase fusion products, which contained different parts of the F protein. It was shown that at least two epitopes on the major part of the F protein (amino acid 2-513) can be recognized by mouse T cells. Functional characterization of three T cell clones showed that they were able to assist MV-specific B cells and bystander B cells for antibody production. Furthermore, they were shown to produce the lymphokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma. It was also shown that these T cell clones induced a MV-specific delayed type hypersensitivity response. These observations suggest that all of the T cell clones characterized belong to the TH1 helper subset.\r"

TSST-1 had no direct effect on the proliferation of CFU-culture and was unable to influence the CSF-induced proliferation and differentiation of these progenitors. In contrast, TSST-1 was a potent inducer in spleen cell cultures of a factor with an ability to induce both colony formation by bone marrow cells and proliferation of an IL-3-dependent cell line. Nanogram amounts of TSST-1 were able to induce the release of CSF activity in spleen cell cultures from both normal and LPS-hyporesponsive mice. Cells from C3H/HeJ mice were as responsive as cells from C3H/He Pas mice. Furthermore, in spleen cell cultures from normal mice, TSST-1 and LPS did not act synergistically to induce CSF activity. Nanogram amounts of TSST-1 were also able to induce CSF activity in vivo but failed to induce IL-3 activity in the serum and organ-conditioned media from TSST-1-treated mice.\r"

The passage into nude mice, however, led to the development of a tumor variant (pT-nude) able to subsequently grow into sublethally x-irradiated but not into immunocompetent NIH mice. NIH mice immunized with this tumor variant developed a strong specific CTL response against the immunizing cell line, whereas the parental transformed pT cell line was not lysed. Clones were derived by limiting dilution from anti-pT-nude bulk population and were tested on a panel of transformed NIH/3T3 lines before and after their growth as tumor into nude mice. All of these lines were lysed by the Lyt-2+ CTL clones as a sole consequence of one in vivo passage into nude mice. The cross-reactive Ag were shown to be related to endogenous retroviral products as assessed by 1) immunoprecipitations of gp70, p15E, and p30 viral proteins in the nude variants but not in parental lines, and 2) by the ability of retroviruses from irradiated pT-nude cells to infect NIH/3T3 or pT lines making them susceptible to lysis by anti-pT-nude CTL clones. These results show that a single passage in nude mice can induce retrovirus-related, cell-surface Ag in transplanted neoplastic cells.\r"

Single cell cytotoxicity assays showed that the Leu 19\"bright\"+ LAK effector cell subset contained a significantly higher percentage of cells capable of binding to and lysing COLO 205 or K562 target cells compared to the Leu 19\"dim\"+ subset. Furthermore, individual Leu 19\"bright\"+ LAK effector cells exhibited a more rapid rate of COLO 205 target cell lysis when compared to Leu 19\"dim\"+ LAK effector cells. In vitro culturing of Leu 19\"bright\"+ or Leu 19\"dim\"+ cells from normal donors with 1500 U/ml rIL-2 resulted in significantly greater levels of proliferation and LAK effector activity by Leu 19\"bright\"+ cells.

These data demonstrate that Leu 19\"bright\"+ LAK cells are significantly more potent effectors than Leu 19\"dim\"+ cells due to quantitative and qualitative differences in the LAK effector cells contained within these subsets. Furthermore, these data indicate that Leu 19\"bright\"+ LAK cells that develop during rIL-2 therapy are derived from Leu 19\"bright\"+ precursor cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have evaluated both the proliferative response as well as the Thy-1 Ag expression of lymphocytes from mice treated in vivo with an anti-Thy-1 immunotoxin (IT). The IT was a rat IgG2c mAb recognizing the Thy-1 Ag, disulfide-linked to a ribosome-inactivating protein isolated from the seeds of the plant Saponaria officinalis (soapwort). Toxicity studies showed that a single i.v. injection of doses up to 20 micrograms IT/mouse was well tolerated and allowed indefinite survival. The Con A-induced proliferative response of spleen cells from mice killed 1 day after treatment with sublethal doses of IT was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition observed at doses of greater than or equal to 5 micrograms IT/mouse. Control experiments showed that the inhibition was due to the IT and not to its single components. Moreover, the IT effect was abolished by a large (100-fold) excess of anti-Thy-1 mAb alone given concurrently, but not by an unrelated, isotype-matched rat mAb. At all IT doses, the proliferative response to a B cell mitogen (LPS) was normal. Kinetic studies showed a time- and dose-dependent reconstitution of Con A responsiveness. In limiting dilution cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with 5 micrograms IT 1 or 4 days before death, a 97% depletion of T lymphocytes capable of proliferation was observed. Limiting dilution cultures showed that also the thymus of IT-treated mice was depleted by more than 90% of growth-competent T lymphocytes. Cytofluorographic studies of Thy-1+ cells from the spleens of IT-treated mice gave results which did not correlate with those obtained in functional assays. Thus, a dose-dependent reduction, followed by a time-dependent reconstitution of Thy-1+ cells was observed in this case too, but the depletion occurred at later time points and was less complete than that observed in functional assays. Moreover, the mean fluorescence intensity of the residual Thy-1+ cells decreased below normal levels.\r"

We found that tumor-infiltrating helper/inducer T cells isolated from T-9 gliosarcoma-sensitized rats between 4 and 6 days after T-9 gliosarcoma inoculation produced a lymphocyte migration factor (LMF) during in vitro culture. Four peaks of LMF activity (A through D) were detected upon fractionation of LMF by using a Mono Q anion exchange column chromatography. Peak C exhibited the strongest activity among the four peaks of LMF. The action of peak C was chemotactic, but not chemokinetic. Peak C had an isoelectric point of 8.0 and a Mr of 26,000 Da. Only cytotoxic/suppressor T cells were found to be sensitive to peak C in vitro as well as in vivo. It is thus likely that peak C is responsible for the infiltration of cytotoxic/suppressor T cells into tumor tissues. The infiltration of lymphocytes into tumor tissues might also be regulated by the expression of lymphocyte sensitivity for LMF. The target molecule for LMF at 4 days may involve an asparagine-linked oligosaccharide.\r"

We compared the standard morphologic method of identifying leukemic cells, the Sezary preparation, to a genotypic method using Southern blot analysis of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in concurrent blood samples. We studied 26 MF/SS patients, five of them in remission, together with five controls from cases of various non-MF/SS skin diseases. Six of 26 MF/SS patients had morphologically atypical circulating leukocytes (3%, 4%, 5%, 14%, 16%, 19%). Seven of 26 MF/SS patients had clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, including the four patients with the greatest percentages of atypical cells and three patients lacking atypical cells. Six of seven patients had skin disease at the time of sampling, including three with erythroderma, two with generalized thick plaques, and one with generalized patches, while one patient was in clinical remission. All five controls lacked morphologic and genotypic evidence of atypical or clonal T-cells. Relative to genotyping, in our series the Sezary preparation was less sensitive and less specific. There were three apparent false negative results in the Sezary preparations, and two potential false positive (patients with 3% and 4% atypical leukocytes); however, there was agreement between the two techniques in most cases. We conclude that gene rearrangement studies may provide an effective test with which to assess the peripheral blood of MF/SS patients.\r"

  ".W": "Mitogens, such as polypeptide growth factors and phorbol ester tumor promoters, act by binding to specific receptors and inducing a pleiotropic response in cultured mammalian cells, which results in the induction of cellular proliferation. An early effect of such agents is the inhibition of binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor. Ultraviolet radiation has also been shown to induce a proliferative response in vivo and in vitro and to act as a tumor promoter in animal skin. We, therefore, examined the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVB - 290-320 nm) on EGF binding to cells in culture. We found that UVB (100-300 J/m2) induced a rapid, dose-dependent inhibition of EGF binding in a mouse fibroblast cell line, which resulted from a decrease in both number and affinity of binding sites. Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by protein kinase C (PKC) is not likely to be the mechanism for inhibition, since UVB treatment did not result in PKC activation or modulation of phorbol diester binding.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the structure, function, and control of CD1a, we have cloned a 1.6-kbp cDNA which encodes the expressed CD1a protein and includes untranslated 5' and 3' sequences and the poly-A tail. As the protein recognized by the monoclonal antibody OKT6, CD1a is a useful marker for Langerhans cells (LC). CD1a is found on these cells and on thymocytes, suggesting an important immunologic role for this molecule. We constructed a cDNA library in lambda gt10 using mRNA from MOLT-4, a cell line that expresses the CD1a surface antigen. We then screened the library with an oligonucleotide synthesized according to a known partial sequence for CD1a, and subcloned the cDNA and its restriction fragments into pGEM for sequencing and probe production. Based on this sequence the CD1a protein is predicted to consist of three extracellular domains (alpha 1-3), a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. DNA 5' to the alpha 1 region may undergo alternative exon splicing. There is high sequence identity between the beta-2 microglobulin binding region of MHC I molecules and CD1a. The secondary structure predicted for CD1a is very similar to the actual structure of HLA-A2, a classical MHC I molecule. The similarity includes the beta pleated sheets and alpha helices which form the antigen binding groove of the alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains. The homology predicted between CD1a and HLA-A2 in these regions appears to exist on the level of secondary structure despite low primary nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity. The structural data and probes we have developed should facilitate studies of the function of CD1a as well as novel investigations of LC.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence suggests that N-oxidized metabolites of procainamide may be responsible for the development of lupus-like symptoms associated with procainamide therapy. The human hepatic microsomal metabolism of procainamide has been previously reported to result in formation of the N-hydroxylamine derivative of procainamide (procainamide hydroxylamine [PAHA]). The objective of this study was to examine the effects of PAHA on human lymphocytes and adherent cells (monocytes and macrophages). When incubated with lymphocytes in whole blood, PAHA enhanced the response to mitogen and immunoglobulin secretion at lower concentrations (less than or equal to 4 mumol/L) but suppressed these functions at higher concentrations. The cytotoxic effects were nonselective for T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes and appeared to involve an interaction between PAHA and hemoglobin. When erythrocytes were removed or when hemoglobin was converted to carboxyhemoglobin, the suppressive effects of PAHA on lymphocytes were reduced. PAHA stimulated interleukin-1 production by adherent cells at 25 mumol/L but had no effect at lower concentrations. Superoxide anion release was unaffected by PAHA in \"resting\" adherent cells. Pretreatment with PAHA (2 mumol/L) diminished superoxide release in response to stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or latex bead phagocytosis but augmented superoxide release when coincubated with PMA or latex. These observations indicate that PAHA produces complex, concentration-dependent interactions with human immunoregulatory cells, and they suggest that the effects of PAHA on lymphocyte function may result from the further oxidation of PAHA by hemoglobin, perhaps to the nitroso form.\r"

An increase in cytosolic calcium has been shown to be associated with the in vitro release of vWF from endothelial cells. The aim of our investigation was to examine the effect of some calcium channel blockers on the release of vWF antigen (vWF:Ag) induced by exercise in two groups of eight healthy subjects during a randomized crossover study between placebo and calcium channel blockers. Placebo and verapamil (80 mg) or nicardipine (10 mg) were given orally at an interval of 2 weeks three times on the day before and once on the morning of the study day. Measurements of plasma vWF:Ag were made at rest and after a progressive maximal exercise on a cycloergometer. A significant increase in absolute values of vWF:Ag was observed after exercise in the subjects given a placebo in both verapamil (0.397 +/- 0.074 U/ml) and nicardipine (0.327 +/- 0.036 U/ml) groups, p less than 0.05. With use of verapamil the rise in vWF:Ag was blunted and not significant (0.123 +/- 0.081 U/ml) whereas a larger increase in vWF:Ag was found in the subjects given nicardipine in comparison with placebo (0.593 +/- 120 U/ml; p less than 0.05). No correlations were observed between exercise-induced changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, blood lactate level, or pH and vWF:Ag changes in the subjects given a placebo or in those given calcium channel blockers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thus, this data does not support the hypothesis myringotomy, revealed a similar prevalence of bifid uvula.

While more than one half reported that patients only rarely, if ever, mentioned religious issues during a medical visit, a significant proportion of the physicians felt they should address religious issues when an older person indicates religion's importance and that religious issues should not be reserved completely for the clergy. Nearly two thirds of the physicians felt that prayer with patients was appropriate under certain circumstances, and over one third reported having prayed with older patients during extreme physical or emotional distress. Older physicians were less likely than younger to have positive attitudes toward addressing religious issues. The strongest predictors of physicians' belief in the appropriateness of addressing religious concerns were two attitudinal variables that indicated an understanding of the importance of religion in the lives of older adults and an awareness that patients might desire to engage in prayer with them. Hence, the beliefs and attitudes of the physician appear to be important factors in determining their receptivity to discussion of religious issues, which in turn may influence whether patients mention such issues in the context of the medical visit.\r"

Carbonyl iron or mineral oil without mycobacteria were effective adjuvants and whole rat spinal cord was the best antigen. Hyperacute EAE was produced in this manner in some Lewis rats, most dark agouti (DA) rats and most F1 hybrids of these two strains. Clinical signs were earlier in onset and more severe in the DA strain than in the Lewis strain in all adjuvant-antigen combinations that were tested. Dark agouti rats developed clinical signs in six days, histological lesions in five days, and localized EAE lesions could be induced in four days. The data support the hypothesis that hyperacute type lesions (neutrophils and fibrin) can be caused by an exceptionally strong immune response to neural antigen, whether that response is engendered by a particular adjuvant (pertussis vaccine) or by an unusual degree of genetic susceptibility (DA rats).\r"

  ".W": "The carcinogenic effects of methyl-deficient, amino acid-defined diets have been attributed to alterations in cellular methylation reactions. These diets contain no choline, and methionine is replaced by homocysteine. Hence, all methyl groups needed for methionine biosynthesis with subsequent formation of S-adenosylmethionine and polyamines must be formed de novo utilizing folate-dependent reduction of one-carbon units. In rats fed the methyl-deficient diet, there was a marked decrease in total liver folate levels. This decrease was apparent in the levels of the individual forms of folate: 10-HCO-H4folate, 5-HCO-H4folate, 5-CH3-H4folate and H4folate. The percent of the total folate pool made up by 5-CH3-H4folate did not change, however, until after the rats had been fed the methyl-deficient diet for 4 wk, and then an increase was seen. After the methyl-deficient rats were switched to a nutritionally adequate control diet containing methionine and choline, all values rapidly reversed. Increased use of folate for methyl group biosynthesis may be responsible for the loss of folates from the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Guinea pig ileum is the classical experimental model for assessing the biological activity of complement-derived anaphylatoxins. Nevertheless, it is still at issue whether C3a-induced ileal contraction is entirely dependent on histamine release. We report that the contraction of the intestinal smooth muscle in response to C3a is characterized by two components, fast and slow, whose incidence and amplitude is strictly dependent on C3a concentration; the larger the concentration of C3a, the greater the incidence and magnitude of the fast component and the less frequent the slow component. The fast and slow components were characterized by a sigmoid and bell-shaped concentration-response curve, respectively. The fast component was associated with the release of endogenous histamine, increased in magnitude with the quantity of histamine released and was prevented by the histamine H1 receptor antagonist pyrilamine. On the contrary, there was no correlation between the quantity of histamine released by C3a and the magnitude of the slow component. Instead, the slow component was associated with the release of PGE2 and was prevented by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. Neither component was affected by the leukotriene receptor antagonist FPL 55712. Our data indicate that C3a-induced ileal contraction is partially histamine dependent in that histamine mediates only the fast component, whereas cyclooxygenase metabolites are responsible for the slow component.\r"

The increase in cytosolic calcium in AtT-20 cells induced by CRF and PMA was blocked by calcium channel antagonists indicating that both agents stimulate calcium influx. The ability of PMA to raise cytosolic calcium levels was prevented by the sodium channel antagonist tetrodotoxin, suggesting that phorbol esters depolarize the cell membrane or increase action potential frequency to enhance calcium influx. The K+ channel antagonists, tetraethylammonium, cesium and 4-aminopyridine, inhibited PMA-stimulated calcium influx in AtT-20 cells. Thus, one mechanism by which protein kinase C activation may lead to a depolarization of the cell membrane is through a reduction in K+ currents. In contrast, neither tetraethylammonium or cesium reduced CRF-stimulated calcium influx into AtT-20 cells. The stimulation of calcium influx by CRF, therefore, appears to not involve changes in K+ currents in AtT-20 cells. CRF activates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase to stimulate calcium influx either by facilitating calcium conductance directly or by modifying the membrane potential or firing activity of AtT-20 cells.\r"

This finding suggests persistent enterovirus infection, particularly coxsackie B virus infection. IgM responses persisted for at least 1 year and for up to 10 years after onset of symptoms. In contrast, patients with acute enterovirus infections, including acute pericarditis, had transient responses. Among patients with acute pericarditis, the level of IgM antibody was significantly higher in those who subsequently relapsed (mean 1.21, range 0.6-2.0 optical density [OD] units) than in those who did not (0.4, 0.2-0.9 OD units; p less than 0.01). Of 86 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 28 (33%) showed enterovirus-specific IgM responses which were present for up to 19 months before transplantation and persisted up to 4 years afterwards. Although the distribution of HLA types in these patients was similar to that in the general population, the frequency of the HLA A2 haplotype was significantly higher in those who were IgM positive. IgM antibody was significantly more common in those who had had symptoms for longer than a year before transplantation than in those with a shorter duration of symptoms (1 of 21 vs 8 of 23; p less than 0.02). Persistent virus-specific serum IgA responses were also shown in patients with chronic cardiac disease.\r"

Only four of 42 (9.5%) of peripheral blood lymphocytes and zero of eight (0%) of peritoneal cavity lymphocytes had spontaneous cytotoxicity (greater than 20%) against the ovarian carcinoma lines. After in vitro exposure to recombinant interleukin-2, 41 of 42 (98%) of patients' blood lymphocytes showed a two- to fivefold increase in cytotoxicity against K562 (a lymphoblastoid human target), and 40 of 42 (95%) demonstrated lymphokine-activated killer cytotoxicity (greater than 20%) to the ovarian carcinoma lines. Lymphokine-activated killer activity against fresh allogeneic cell lines was variable, although most patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes (70%) had significant cytotoxicity. By contrast, incubation of patients' peritoneal cavity lymphocytes with recombinant interleukin-2 in vitro did not result in the generation of lymphokine-activated killer cell activity against K562 or ovarian cell lines. Peritoneal lymphocytes did produce lymphokine-activated killer cells in the presence of OK432 in half of the patients tested. The presence of autologous serum during recombinant interleukin-2 activation with blood lymphocytes had an augmentative effect on the resulting lymphokine-activated killer cytotoxicity in two of 20 patients, a suppressive effect in four of 20, and no effect in the other 14 of 20 patients tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The procedure uses an Nd:YAG laser to lyse the zonules to obtain a clear aphakic visual axis. Pretreatment best-corrected visual acuity was 20/60 or worse in eight eyes (6 eyes less than or equal to 20/200). Movement of the crystalline lens was achieved after zonulysis in all cases (100%), and a clear aphakic visual axis, sufficient to maintain aphakic correction without diplopia or glare, was obtained in eight eyes (88.9%). The procedure was combined with optical iridotomy in three cases (33.3%). Five cases (55.6%) required more than one zonulysis treatment. Visual acuity improved two or more Snellen lines in all but one eye (7 eyes greater than or equal to 20/60). Four cases had complications which included: increased intraocular pressure (IOP), mild iritis, recurrent migration of the lens into the visual axis, and crystalline lens damage. The final two complications necessitated eventual surgical removal of the lens. These results suggest that Nd:YAG laser zonulysis may be of benefit as an alternative treatment modality for selected patients with lens subluxation.\r"

  ".W": "The cell-specific expression of herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) has provided a simple and highly efficient technique to achieve conditional ablation of targeted cell types in transgenic mice. The ablation is induced by treating transgenic animals expressing HSV-1-tk with the antiherpetic drug ganciclovir. In lymphoid tissues of mice expressing HSV-1-tk from an immunoglobulin promoter, administration of ganciclovir leads to massive destruction of B- and T-cell lineages. Tissues not expressing HSV-1-tk are insensitive to drug treatment. After depletion of greater than 99% of total thymocytes, a number of progenitor cells remain that are able to repopulate all T-cell lineages within 7 days. The ability to control and direct ablation allows for creation of conditional mutant phenotypes at precise periods of development. This technique also provides a potential means to enrich stem cell populations as well as permitting the creation of animal models for particular pathological conditions.\r"

  ".U": "89202396\r", 
  ".W": "Hepatocytes are well coupled by gap junctions, which allow the diffusion of small molecules between cells. Although gap junctions in many tissues are permeable to molecules larger than cAMP and in several preparations gap junctions pass cAMP itself, little direct evidence supports permeation by other second-messenger species. Ca2+, perhaps the smallest second messenger, would be expected to cross gap junctions, but the issue is complicated because gap-junction channels are closed when intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, is elevated to micromolar levels or above. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), a second messenger that can evoke Ca2+ release, might also reduce junctional permeability by this mechanism. We report here evidence for transjunctional flux of Ca2+ and InsP3 in freshly isolated pairs or small clusters of rat hepatocytes. The Ca2+ indicator fura-2 was used to monitor transjunctional diffusion of Ca2+ directly or to detect passage of InsP3 by localized Ca2+ release. Fura-2 injected as the free acid passed between cells. Injection of InsP3 or CaCl2 immediately increased [Ca2+]i in the injected cell (peak values less than 1 microM), and [Ca2+]i increased rapidly in contacting cells (within seconds). The initial rise in [Ca2+]i induced by InsP3 was greater at discrete regions in the cytoplasm of both injected and uninjected cells and was inconsistent with simple diffusion of Ca2+. In the coupled cells the regions of greatest increase were not necessarily near the contact zone. In contrast, the rise induced in [Ca2+]i by CaCl2 injection when cells were bathed in normal Ca2+ was always more diffuse than with InsP3 injection, and in cells coupled to a cell injected with CaCl2 the earliest and maximal increases occurred at the region of cell contact. This difference in distribution indicates that injected InsP3 (or an active metabolite, but not Ca2+) diffused between cells to cause localized release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Ca2+ injection induced a rise in [Ca2+]i in coupled cells even when cells were maintained in Ca2+-free saline, suggesting that changes in [Ca2+]i seen in adjacent cells were due to transjunctional diffusion from the injected cell and not to uptake from the extracellular solution. However, in Ca2+-free saline, [Ca2+]i distribution was nonuniform, indicating that Ca2+-releasing mechanisms contribute to the observed changes. No increase in [Ca2+]i was seen in adjacent cells when Ca2+ was injected after treatment with the uncoupling agent octanol (500 microM), which itself did not change [Ca2+]i.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The lysis of autologous melanoma targets could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against monomorphic HLA class I determinants. For proliferation of CTLs, the stimulation with the relevant target antigen on autologous tumor cells was essential. Immunoselection experiments carried out with two CTL clones revealed the existence of melanoma subclones that were resistant to lysis by the CTL clones used for immunoselection but were still lysed by other autologous CTL clones. This analysis allowed us to identify three stable simultaneously expressed antigens on the melanoma cells defined by autologous CTLs.\r"

Previous studies have shown that these drugs increase the uptake of [3H]thymidine into DNA of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes but inhibit cell growth and immunoglobulin secretion. This study shows that the 4-quinolones strongly (up to 100 times) increase the recovery of interleukin 2 (IL-2) in culture supernatants of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated normal human lymphocytes and also prolong the kinetics of IL-2 production. The effect was significant at clinically achievable concentrations (5 micrograms/ml). In addition to hyperproduction of IL-2, the level of RNA hybridizing with a human IL-2 cDNA probe was also intensely elevated (16-32 times) in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes cultured with ciprofloxacin (80 micrograms/ml). The mechanism responsible for 4-quinolone-mediated effects on T cells is at present unclear, but evidence is presented that suggests the effect is not exerted at the level of protein kinase C activation. Ciprofloxacin at 80 micrograms/ml also decreased the expression of IL-2 receptors measured by immunofluorescence with CD 25 antibodies and a radiolabeled IL-2 binding assay. At the same concentration of ciprofloxacin, there was a very low expression of the transferrin receptor and the cell size increased very little in human lymphocytes after PHA stimulation. The enhanced IL-2 production by 4-quinolones may contribute to side effects reported when these drugs are used for treatment of patients.\r"

Previous studies with monoclonal antibodies indicate that sialophorin is a component of a T-lymphocyte activation pathway. Here we describe the cDNA cloning and derived amino acid sequence of human sialophorin. The sequence predicts an integral membrane polypeptide with an N-terminal hydrophobic signal region followed by a mucin-like 235-residue extracellular region with a uniform distribution of 46 serine, 47 threonine, and 24 proline residues. This is followed by a 23-residue transmembrane region and a 123-residue C-terminal intracellular region. These latter regions have been highly conserved during evolution; the intracellular region contains a number of potential phosphorylation sites that might mediate transduction of activation signals. The chromosomal location of the sialophorin gene was determined and the implications of this assignment for the pathogenesis of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome are discussed.\r"

To analyze Od-T-cell interactions, we selected from normal SJL/J mouse splenocytes sensitized in vitro by Lewis rat Od a T-cell clone, named C2, exhibiting a surface phenotype of mature T cell (Thy 1+, CD3+, CD8+, CD4-, asialo-GM1-). C2 T cells displayed a specific cytotoxicity to syngeneic Od as well as to rat Od, but not to astrocytes or lymphoblasts, or to YAC-1 cells, a target for natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer activity. The T-cell receptor of clone C2 was found to be a CD3-associated alpha/beta-chain heterodimer similar to that usually expressed by antigen-specific MHC-restricted mature T cells. Attempts to block the C2-mediated cytolysis by a series of monoclonal antibodies showed that both the CD3-T-cell receptor complex and the CD8 accessory molecule were required for OD-T-cell interaction and confirmed the lack of involvement of polymorphic MHC products as epitope-presenting structures. Antibodies directed against a surface Od glycoprotein, previously shown to elicit demyelinating autoantibodies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, fully blocked the cytotoxicity of T-cell clone C2 to its Od target. These data suggest that an epitope of a surface Od glycoprotein may be directly and specifically recognized and killed by autoreactive T cells expressing an alpha/beta receptor without conventional MHC restriction.\r"

We have examined adaptation in dissociated hair cells by whole-cell patch-clamp recording and video microscopy. Adaptation was present in these cells, and it depended on extracellular calcium. The adaptation rate--as well as the position of the resting current-displacement curve--also depended on membrane potential, suggesting that calcium passes into the cytoplasm to reach its site of action. After abrupt hyperpolarization, the adaptation rate increased within milliseconds, suggesting that the calcium site is within a few micrometers of the ion channels through which calcium enters. The voltage dependence of the resting current-displacement curve, together with the \"gating springs\" hypothesis for transduction, predicts movement of the bundle away from the kinocilium when the cell is depolarized. This was observed.\r"

A physiological relevance of these channels is apparent from the stereoselective, potent inhibition of parathyroid hormone-stimulated calcium uptake into osteoblast-like cells in culture by desmethoxyverapamil, a phenylalkylamine calcium antagonist. Secretion by these cells of the bone matrix protein osteocalcin is stimulated by BAY K 8644 and blocked by desmethoxyverapamil and nitrendipine.
