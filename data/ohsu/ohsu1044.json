  ".W": "The neurodevelopmental, health, and growth outcomes for 28 six-year-old extremely low birth weight (ELBW) (birth weight less than 1001 gm) children were compared with those of 26 control children born at term. The two groups did not differ in mean weight or height, but the ELBW group had smaller head circumferences (p = 0.015). Kaufman mental processing scores correlated with head circumference (p = 0.0003). Significantly more of the ELBW children (61%) had mild or moderate to severe neurologic problems compared with control children (23%) (p = 0.003). Three ELBW children had mild spastic diplegia; one was blind. Eighteen (64%) of the ELBW children had required rehospitalization versus five (20%) of the comparison group. The mean Kaufman Mental Processing Composite was lower for the ELBW group, but when the data were analyzed by maternal education, only those children whose mothers had a twelfth-grade education had significantly lower scores (p = 0.0001). A similar pattern of group differences was seen for scores on visual-motor function (p = 0.0045), visual-perceptual abilities (p = 0.003), and attention span (p = 0.0001). No group differences were seen regarding hyperactivity or parental stress. Overall functional disability among the ELBW children was considered absent in 46%, mild in 36%, and moderate to severe in 18%. There was a significant association (p = 0.029) between classification of handicap at 12 to 34 months and classification at 6 years. No neonatal factors correlated with 6-year outcome. A significant proportion of ELBW children had no severe disabilities, but many had dysfunctions likely to affect learning and behavior in school.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the outcome of apparently stillborn infants who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we studied the short- and long-term outcome of 93 infants who had an Apgar score of 0 at 1 minute of age and were resuscitated at birth. Sixty-two (66.6%) responded and left the delivery room alive; 26 (42%) of the 62 infants died in the neonatal period and 36 infants were discharged home; of the 36 infants, three subsequently died during infancy. Of the 33 survivors, ten were lost to follow-up after discharge. Developmental assessment of 23 of 33 long-term survivors revealed normal outcome in 14 (61.7%), abnormal results in 6 (26%), and suspect status in 3 (13%). Fifty-eight infants had an Apgar score of 0 at greater than or equal to 10 minutes of age and all except one died; the surviving infant has an abnormal developmental outcome. We conclude that 39% of apparently stillborn infants who were resuscitated survived beyond the neonatal period and that 61% of the 23 survivors who were available for developmental follow-up had normal development at the time of last examination. Survival was unlikely if there was no response after 10 minutes of resuscitation.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a nursery Neurobiologic Risk Score (NBRS) based on potential mechanisms of brain cell injury in preterm infants and correlated it with developmental outcome at the corrected ages of 6, 15, and 24 months. The NBRS was determined at 2 weeks of age and at the time of discharge from intensive care in 58 preterm infants with birth weights less than or equal to 1500 gm. The NBRS correlated significantly with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Mental Development Index (MDI) (r = -0.61 to -0.40) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) (r = -0.59 to -0.46), and with abnormal neurologic examination findings (r = 0.59 to 0.73) at the three testing periods. Although 12 of the 13 items composing the NBRS individually correlated with one or more outcome variables, seven items (infection, blood pH, seizures, intraventricular hemorrhage, assisted ventilation, periventricular leukomalacia, and hypoglycemia) accounted for almost all of the explained variance. Logistic regression of individual items demonstrated intraventricular hemorrhage to be the most important item for predicting the MDI at 24 months; pH was the most influential item for predicting the PDI at every testing period. A shorter, revised NBRS that included only the seven significant items demonstrated as strong a correlation with developmental outcome as the original NBRS. A revised 2-week score of greater than or equal to 5 or a discharge score of greater than or equal to 6 demonstrated 100% specificity and had a 100% positive predictive value for an abnormal outcome at 24 months of age in this group of infants. We conclude that the NBRS identifies during the intensive care nursery stay those infants at highest risk for an abnormal outcome related to nursery events. In addition, analysis of NBRS items provides insight into the relative importance of individual factors for influencing mental, motor, and neurologic outcome.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether preoperative stabilization and delay of operative repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) may decrease operative risk, we performed serial pulmonary function tests on 22 newborn infants with CDH and on four infants without pulmonary hypoplasia (two with ileal atresia and two with tracheoesophageal anomalies) who served as control subjects. We used 2 passive respiratory mechanics technique to measure respiratory system compliance. All patients with CDH had respiratory distress immediately after birth, and required mechanical ventilation. Thirteen babies underwent emergency repair (six survived, seven died); nine of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after the operation (two survived, seven died). Operative repair was delayed deliberately for 2 to 11 days in nine infants with severe hypoxemia. Six immediately received ECMO for 4 to 10 days; one died of intraventricular hemorrhage, and five survived and later underwent surgical repair. The seventh patient did not receive ECMO but appeared to have respiratory distress syndrome of infancy and improved after administration of synthetic surfactant. Improvement was seen in two additional infants who received conventional assisted ventilation during a 48-hour delay before surgery, and survived. In all, eight of nine infants who underwent preoperative stabilization survived (p less than 0.05 compared with survival after emergency surgery). Following surgical repair immediately after birth, respiratory system compliance improved only slightly during the first week of life, a time when control infants had a rapid increase in respiratory system compliance (p less than 0.001). In contrast, respiratory system compliance increased nearly twofold in the nine patients undergoing preoperative stabilization (p less than 0.02). Preoperative ECMO was associated with an increase in respiratory system compliance of more than 60% for 1 week, a significant difference from respiratory system compliance among patients undergoing emergency CDH repair (p less than 0.05). These observations provide physiologic evidence of possible benefits of preoperative stabilization before repair of CDH.\r"

  ".U": "91210978\r", 
  ".W": "The predictive value of anthropometric measurements in the identification of infants at risk for early postnatal morbidity was assessed in a cohort of 490 neonates born in Yaounde, Cameroon. Mid-arm circumference (MAC), head circumference, weight, and length were measured within 6 hours of birth, and the gestational age, individual MAC/head circumference ratio, and individual ponderal index were calculated. A detailed questionnaire on gestational medical history was also obtained from the mothers. All infants were then closely monitored during the first 72 hours after delivery for the appearance of symptoms requiring medical intervention and treated accordingly. Low birth weight (LBW) was observed in 37.75%, prematurity in 25.5%, and small size for gestational age in 14.1% of the neonates. Gestational medical problems were reported by 44.3% of the mothers; malaria was the most frequent. Early postnatal morbidity was observed in 26% of the infants; infection (53%), respiratory distress (26%), hypoglycemia (26%), and convulsions (11.7%) accounted for most of the problems. The MAC correlated best of all variables with birth weight (r = 0.91); a value of less than or equal to 9.5 cm had a 93% sensitivity and a 90.5% specificity in the prediction of LBW. An MAC cutoff value of less than or equal to 9.5 cm was also the best of all variables in the prediction of early postnatal morbidity, and 85.2% sensitivity and 74.3% specificity were achieved. We conclude that in developing countries, where scales are not always available and the overburdened maternity wards cannot allow for medical surveillance of every infant, the MAC can be used in the estimation of birth weight. Moreover, an appropriately calculated cutoff value of MAC may serve as a reliable indicator of LBW and of infants at risk for early postnatal morbidity.\r"

Outcome measures were the respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and a clinical score based on the degree of wheezing and retractions. Patients in the salbutamol arm had significantly greater improvement in clinical scores after the initial treatment (p = 0.04). There was no difference between the groups in oxygen saturation (p = 0.74); patients treated with salbutamol had a small increase in heart rate after two treatments (159 +/- 16 vs 151 +/- 16; p = 0.03).

Eighteen children, 2 to 69 months of age (mean +/- SD: 31 +/- 23 months), were treated with intravenously administered famotidine to prevent bleeding of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Continuous intragastric pH monitoring was carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of various intravenous doses. An initial dose of 0.4 mg/kg was given and repeated only after the intragastric pH had dropped to less than 4.0 for 2 hours. Increased doses were given (0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 mg/kg) if the previous dose did not raise the intragastric pH to greater than 4.0 for greater than or equal to 6 hours. Sixteen patients achieved an intragastric pH greater than or equal to 4.0 for greater than or equal to 6 hours, 13 with a dose of 0.4 mg/kg, and three with a dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The mean duration of continuous pH greater than 4.0 per dose was 9.0 +/- 7.5 hours. Ten patients received two or more intravenous doses of famotidine; the mean duration of pH greater than 4.0 after the second dose was less than that after the first (14.9 +/- 8.0 hours vs 6.9 +/- 3.2 hours, p less than 0.01). We conclude that intravenous famotidine therapy raises gastric pH to greater than 4.0 for approximately 9 hours in most children. Prolonged intravenous use of famotidine rapidly leads to a decreased duration of efficacy, necessitating intragastric pH monitoring to assess the effectiveness of treatment.\r"

Whereas low doses of nalorphine antagonize morphine analgesia, higher nalorphine doses are analgesic, with ED50 values (95% CL) of 13.4 (11.5, 15.8) mg/kg in the writhing and 39.5 (26.6, 60.1) mg/kg in the tail-flick assay. Although nalorphine analgesia is sensitive to naloxone, implying an opioid mechanism, neither beta-funaltrexamine, naltrindole nor nor-binaltorphomine antagonized nalorphine analgesia in the tail-flick assay at doses which reversed equianalgesic doses of their respective selective agonists. Nalorphine and the kappa 3 opiate naloxone benzoylhydrazone demonstrated analgesic cross-tolerance regardless of whether the mice were treated chronically with either nalorphine or naloxone benzoylhydrazone. Animals tolerant to nalorphine were not tolerant to either morphine or U50,488H (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(pyrrolindinyl)-cyclohexyl]- benzeneacetamide). Furthermore, nalorphine retained its analgesic potency in animals tolerant to U50,488H. Nalorphine exerts its analgesia predominantly through supraspinal mechanisms. Against systemically administered nalorphine, the opiate antagonist WIN44,441 ([2,6,11S-(-)-1-cyclopentyl-5-(1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-8-hydroxy-3,6, 11-trimethyl-2,6-methano-e-benazocine-11-yl)-3-pentanone methylsulfonate) reversed nalorphine analgesia 1500-fold more potently when administered i.c.v. (ID50, 0.1 ng) than when given intrathecally (ID50,159 ng). Together these results indicate that nalorphine analgesia in the tail-flick assay does not involve mu, delta or the U50,488H-sensitive kappa 1 receptor and strongly suggest a role for supraspinal kappa 3 receptors.\r"

Their ability to solubilize Al from insoluble Al borate in a previously described octanol/aqueous (o/a) system was tested. Salicylhydroxamic acid, rhodotorulic acid, the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones and a sulfonated linear polycatecholcarboxamide significantly increased solubilized Al, suggesting Al chelation potential. Some of the above compounds and some compounds previously shown to solubilize Al in the o/a system were tested for their ability to mobilize Al from the Al plasma binding protein transferrin. Chelators solubilizing Al in the o/a system were comparably effective in mobilizing Al from transferrin, supporting the utility of the o/a system as a screening method. The o/a distribution coefficient of each chelator was determined, when possible, to assess its hydrophilicity. When compared with the suggested desirable hydrophilicity of effective chelators, the o/a distribution coefficient of many of the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones and a sulfonated linear polycatecholcarboxamide suggest that they might be able to chelate intracellular Al. The o/a distribution coefficient of each Al-chelator complex was determined, when possible, to predict the likelihood of redistribution within or excretion from the intact animal of this complex. Complexation of chelators with Al usually increased chelator hydrophilicity. The results suggest several compounds that warrant further investigation as potential alternatives to desferrioxamine in the treatment of Al accumulation and toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The effects on sleep of six beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol, dilevalol, pindolol, metoprolol, celiprolol and atenolol) which differ in their pharmacological characteristics were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded for 6 hr after p.o. administration of drugs or vehicle, and the stages of wakefulness, rapid eye movements (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (non-REM) were classified thereafter. In separate experiments antihypertensive activity of each drug was assessed by the tail-cuff technique. The most common effect of the beta-blockers examined was a decrease of the duration of REM. The effect was marked for propranolol (10-100 mg/kg), celiprolol (10-100 mg/kg) and pindolol (1-10 mg/kg), whereas it occurred at low doses, but not at high doses for metoprolol (10 mg/kg) and atenolol (3 and 10 mg/kg). Dilevalol induced a moderate REM decrease at 30 mg/kg only. For the beta-1 antagonists, the dose reducing REM substantially (ED30) was slightly above (1.4- to 3.7-fold) that effective on blood pressure (ED10), whereas the separation was high for pindolol (17.4-fold) and dilevalol (22.4-fold). Conversely, propranolol displayed a weak antihypertensive activity in this model and was more potent on REM than in reducing blood pressure. Propranolol, celiprolol and atenolol also increased duration of wakefulness. Considering the pharmacological characteristics of the beta-blockers examined, it is suggested that selective beta-1 antagonism and interaction with other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, are relevant to the potential effects of this class of antihypertensive drugs on sleep function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91211033\r", 
  ".W": "The antinociceptive effect of subcortically administered nicotine was investigated in the rat using the hot-plate and tail-flick tests. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with guide cannulas aimed at 185 sites in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. After 1 week, nicotine was injected in 0.5 microliter of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) of the mesopontine tegmentum and the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) of the ventral medulla were the most sensitive sites of nicotine-induced antinociception. The median effective doses of nicotine to inhibit hot-plate or tail-flick nociception after PPTg or NRM administration ranged between 1.4 and 3 nmol. The lack of effect of s.c. injections of naloxone on the antinociception induced by nicotine in the PPTg or NRM ruled out endogenous opioid mechanisms. Coadministration of mecamylamine or pirenzepine with nicotine into the NRM competitively antagonized nicotine-induced antinociception. The administration of the muscurinic cholinergic type 2 receptor antagonist methoctramine into the NRM produced a strong antinociceptive response which was blocked by prior treatment of the NRM with hemicholinium-3. Hemicholinium-3 pretreatment of either the PPTg or the NRM antagonized the antinociception induced by nicotine at these sites. Hemicholinium-3 pretreatment of the NRM also antagonized the antinociception produced by s.c. administered nicotine. The antinociceptive effects of nicotine injected in the PPTg were blocked by procainamide injections in the NRM; however, the antinociceptive effects of nicotine injected in the NRM were not blocked by bilateral injections of procainamide in the PPTg. Both lesioning the PPTg with ibotenic acid and pretreating the NRM with hemicholinium-3 abolished completely the antinociception induced by nicotine or (+)-cis-dioxolane microinjections into the PPTg. However, neither ibotenic acid-induced nor electrolytic lesions of the PPTg alone altered CRL. The data support the existence of a tonically active cholinergic pathway which is under autoinhibitory control that originates in the PPTg, terminates in the NRM and modulates nociception by activating descending pain inhibitory systems relaying within the NRM.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared two different methods of attenuating protein kinase C (PKC) activity in vascular smooth muscle. First, the effects of two purported PKC inhibitors, staurosporine (stauro) and H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride], were examined on contractility of isolated, intact canine femoral artery. In arterial rings stauro was equipotent in relaxing contractions induced by phenylephrine (PE), phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and KCl (IC50, 0.31 +/- 0.19; 0.35 +/- 0.2; and 0.34 +/- 0.16 microM). H-7, in comparison, was markedly less potent than stauro (IC50, 0.67 +/- 0.2, 2.33 +/- 0.24; and 6.5 +/- 5.5 microM for PE, PDBu and KCl, respectively). Pretreatment of tissues with 1 microM stauro suppressed tension development almost completely when PE and PDBu were the contractile agonists, and partially in K(+)-depolarized rings. H-7, in contrast, had no inhibitory effect on agonist-induced contraction. Neither basal nor K(+)-stimulated calcium influx was affected by 10 microM stauro. Second, prolonged exposure of canine carotid arterial rings to PDBu (1-100 nM for 24 hr), a means of depleting PKC from the tissue, caused dose-dependent attenuation of agonist-induced contractions. Preincubation with 100 nM PDBu caused complete inhibition of tension induced by norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin and partial inhibition of PDBu- and KCl-induced contractions. Lowering the concentration of PDBu during preincubation to 30, 10 or 1 nM reduced markedly the inhibitory effects. The inactive phorbolester 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (4 alpha-PDD) had no effect on agonist-induced contractions. PKC activity was determined in rings contracted isometrically with PDBu or NE after prolonged exposure to vehicle, 4 alpha-PDD or PDBu.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our preliminary studies indicated that certain monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors display high affinity for the sigma-binding sites labeled with (+)[3H]-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-1-(propyl)piperidine [(+)[3H]-3-PPP] in C57BL/6 mouse brain (Itzhak, Y., and Kassim, C. D.: Eur. J. Pharmacol. 176: 107-108, 1990). In the present study, the drug specificity and the subcellular distribution of (+)[3H]-3-PPP, (+)[3H]-N-allylnormetazocine [(+)[3H]SKF 10047] and [3H]1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine ([3H]DTG) binding sites in C57BL/6 mouse brain were investigated, and the properties of clorgyline interaction with the (+)-3-PPP/sigma-binding site(s) were examined. (+)[3H]-3-PPP binding, but not [3H]DTG binding, is inhibited by low concentrations (nM) of the dextrorotatory (+)-isomers of SKF 10047, 3-PPP and deprenyl and the type A MAO inhibitor, clorgyline. The haloperidol-sensitive/(+)[3H]SKF 10047 binding sites display virtually identical sensitivity towards the MAO inhibitors as (+)-3-PPP binding sites. These observations suggest a distinction between [3H]DTG and (+)[3H]-3-PPP/(+)[3H]SKF 10047 binding sites in the mouse brain. Clorgyline interaction with (+)-3-PPP/sigma-sites is competitive and reversible unlike the interaction of clorgyline with MAO-A. The sigma-ligands tested do not inhibit MAO activity and bind to sites that are apparently distinct from the MAO binding sites labeled with [3H]-N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. However, the mitochondrial fraction of the mouse brain that expresses MAO activity and high density of [3H]-N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine binding sites also comprises high density of (+)-3-PPP/(+)SKF 10047 binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91211036\r", 
  ".W": "3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), a nucleoside analog effective against the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus, is actively secreted by rat, rabbit and human kidney. The mechanism of AZT transport across the basolateral membrane was characterized by examining the effect of AZT on organic cation and organic anion transport systems in rat renal basolateral membrane vesicles (BLMV) by using a rapid filtration assay. The following prototypic substrates were used: N1-[3H]methylnicotinamide and [3H]tetraethylammonium (TEA) for organic cations and p-[3H]aminohippurate (PAH) for an organic anion. AZT was an effective inhibitor of PAH transport. The dose-response curves for AZT and probenecid, an organic anion inhibitor, revealed IC50 values of 225 and 15 microM, respectively. To clarify further the actions of AZT at the organic anion transporter, counterflow studies were performed. Preloading BLMV with AZT trans-stimulated the uptake of PAH. The specificity of transport was assessed by examining the effect of AZT on organic cation transport. AZT did not inhibit uptake of NMN or TEA (pHin = pHout = 7.5). However, AZT slightly inhibited uptake of TEA under optimized transport conditions (1 mM TEA load). We conclude that AZT transport in rat BLMV is mediated predominantly by the renal organic anion transport system which is consistent with the capability of an organic anion to reduce the renal clearance of AZT in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We determined if the cardioprotective effects of the potassium channel opener cromakalim are stereoselective and if it can preserve adenine nucleotides in ischemic myocardium. We subjected isolated isovolumically beating rat hearts to 25 min of global ischemia and reperfusion with and without pretreatment by cromakalim or its enantiomers. All of these compounds significantly increased preischemic coronary flow with the (3S,4R)-(-)-enantiomer being more potent (EC25 = 0.52 microM) compared to cromakalim (EC25 = 1.04 microM) and the (3R,4S)-(+)-enantiomer (EC25 greater than 100 microM). The (-)-enantiomer was also significantly more potent in reducing ischemic/reperfusion damage compared to cromakalim and its (+)-enantiomer. Reperfusion contractile function was improved significantly and lactate dehydrogenase release was reduced by these compounds. Time to contracture was also increased significantly by the (-)-enantiomer (EC25 = 2.27 microM), cromakalim (EC25 = 4.89 microM) and the (+)-enantiomer (EC25 greater than 100 microM). We determined if cromakalim, in a concentration which does not depress cardiac function (10 microM), can preserve high energy phosphates during ischemia in isolated rat hearts. Cromakalim significantly preserved ATP at 15 to 25 min of ischemia. Adenylate energy charge was also significantly improved by cromakalim at 20 to 25 min into an ischemic episode. Thus, the cardioprotective effects of cromakalim are stereoselective and may be due partly to preservation of myocardial energy reserves. It is significant that cromakalim can preserve adenine nucleotides despite its lack of negative inotropic effects.\r"

With all reflexes intact, felodipine (25 nmol/kg, intravenously) caused significant decreases in LV end-systolic pressure (132 +/- 13 vs. 109 +/- 14 mm Hg, P less than .05) and effective arterial elastance (11.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 8.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg/ml, P less than .01), while the heart rate increased (109 +/- 15 vs. 118 +/- 16 min-1, P less than .05). There were no significant changes in LV end-systolic volume, stroke volume or the maximum time derivative of LV pressure. The plasma felodipine concentration was 16.1 +/- 1.4 nmol/l (mean +/- time S.D.). Three relations that provide load-insensitive measures of LV performance were determined from variably loaded pressure-volume loops produced by transient caval occlusions. Felodipine increased the slopes of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation (8.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 10.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg/ml, mean +/- S.D., P less than .05), the maximal time-derivative of LV pressure-end-diastolic volume relation (103 +/- 28 vs. 127 +/- 34 mm Hg/sec ml, P less than .05) and the stroke work-end diastolic volume relation (82 +/- 4 vs. 93 +/- 6 mm Hg, P less than .05). All three relations were shifted toward the left after felodipine. Similar increases in slopes and leftward shifts with felodipine, indicating enhanced contractile effect, were also present after autonomic blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recently, verapamil alone has been shown to diminish proliferation in a variety of neoplastic cell lines. Using the patch-clamp technique, the action of verapamil on voltage-gated K+ channels in two cell lines of human small-cell carcinoma of the lung, NCI-H146 and NCI-H82, was investigated. With inward Na+ current suppressed, virtually all control cells exhibited a slowly inactivating outward current that was insensitive to alterations in the external Ca++ concentration. Externally applied verapamil enhanced the rate and extent of outward K+ current (IK) inactivation. Verapamil at a concentration of 20 microM diminished peak IK, evoked by a test pulse to +60 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV, from 1.38 +/- 0.11 nA (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 29 cells) to 0.56 +/- 0.13 nA (n = 11) and caused IK to decay to less than 20% of the peak current within 60 msec. After blocking IK and Na+ current, Ca++ current (ICa) was measured in the presence of 10 mM Ca++. The addition of 100 microM verapamil to the external bath resulted in a 53% reduction of H146 ICa. Peak ICa fell from 81 +/- 9 pA (n = 22) to 38 +/- 8 pA (n = 12). Examination of the whole-cell K+ current on single cells before and immediately after the addition of 100 microM verapamil clearly revealed that the drug had no effect on the initial activation phase of IK, suggesting that K+ channels first open before interacting with the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighteen hours after treatment, the slices were incubated with [3H]NE, superfused in the presence of reuptake inhibitor and stimulated electrically with short bursts of 4 pulses delivered at 100 Hz (pseudo-one-pulse; POP) or trains of 36 or 72 pulses delivered at 3 Hz. EEDQ treatment did not affect the overflow of radioactivity evoked by POP, but greatly facilitated overflow at 36 or 72 pulses/3 Hz indicating that the autoinhibition seen under the latter conditions is totally lacking with POP stimulation. KA values determined using 4 pulses/100 Hz were 136, 50 and 625 nM for UK-14304, clonidine and NE, respectively. At 36 or 72 pulses/3 Hz the values were higher by a factor of up to 3. The percentage of receptors active after EEDQ treatment was found to be 5.5 to 8.2% and was not influenced by conditions of stimulation. Receptor reserves were estimated to be about 65% for UK-14304 and NE and 40% for clonidine. The efficacies of UK-14304 and clonidine relative to NE were 1 and 0.5, respectively. The data indicate that KA values for agonists at presynaptic alpha-2 autoreceptors are inevitably underestimated if the released transmitter causes inhibition of release in addition to the drug under investigation.\r"

  ".W": "The primary objective of this work was to investigate how in vivo administration of depolarizing agents increases extracellular concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and simultaneously decreases levels of its chief metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA). To this end the effects of a number of agents on extracellular levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in cat spinal cord were determined by microdialysis and high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The semipermeable portion of the dialysis probe was centered in the dorsal horn. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing elevated K+ or drugs was introduced into the dorsal horn via the dialysis probe. Increases in recovered 5-HT were assumed to reflect increased levels in the extracellular fluid due to release, reduced reuptake and/or reduced metabolism. Depolarizing agents (K+, veratridine and aconitine) increased 5-HT, but dramatically decreased 5-HIAA levels. Extracellular 5-HT returned to near base-line levels with removal of the depolarizing agents. The reduction in 5-HIAA was transient after potassium infusion, but outlasted the infusion of veratridine or aconitine by several hours. Reduction of 5-HIAA could be blocked or reversed with the Na+ channel blockers, lidocaine and tetrodotoxin. Evidently, the decrease in 5-HT metabolism followed activation of sodium channels. Parachloroamphetamine caused an increase in 5-HT levels, presumably reflecting increased 5-HT release, but did not change 5-HIAA levels. Although fluoxetine increased 5-HT, it reduced 5-HIAA, presumably through blockade of 5-HT reuptake leading to a secondary reduction in metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cyclosporin A uptake as well as efflux was strongly dependent on temperature. The Arrhenius plot for cyclosporin A uptake was biphasic, whereas the Arrhenius plot for sulfanilamide uptake, which is transported by a simple diffusion, was linear. These results indicate that a specific mechanism is concerned in the transport of cyclosporin A in LLC-PK1, cells.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine analogs were tested for their ability to relax carbachol-contracted trachea in vitro. The rank order of potency was: 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) greater than 2-chloroadenosine (2-CIADO) greater than 5'-chloroadenosine = N6-R-1-phenyl-2-propyladenosine (R-PIA) greater than N6-cyclohexyladenosine greater than 2-phenylaminoadenosine (CV1808) greater than 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA). The rank order of potency for NECA, 2-CIADO and R-PIA is characteristic of an A2 subtype of adenosine receptor. 8-Para-sulfophenyltheophylline (8-p-ST) and 8-cyclopentyl-1, 3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), were used to antagonize tracheal relaxation elicited by adenosine analogs. 8-p-ST antagonized the 2-CIADO, N6-cyclohexyladenosine, R-PIA and 5'-chloroadenosine responses, but had little or no effect on the CV1808 and MTA responses. 8-p-ST antagonized responses to NECA at concentrations of NECA up to approximately 30 microM, but had no effect on responses to higher concentrations of NECA. The differences in antagonist potency of 8-p-ST and the clear biphasic response of NECA are indicative of at least two mechanisms of adenosine analog action leading to tracheal relaxation. One mechanism is mediated through a xanthine-sensitive site, at which NECA acted in a potent manner, whereas the other mechanism or mechanisms are insensitive to blockade by xanthines and account for the effects of action of MTA and CV1808, as well as for NECA at high concentrations. The low potency of the A1-selective antagonist DPCPX indicates that the xanthine-sensitive site is an A2 type receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Heart rate increased by 20 +/- 7 min-1, P less than .05, but left ventricular (LV) systolic and end-diastolic pressures, cardiac output and LV peak dp/dt did not change. Although coronary vascular resistance decreased by 0.26 +/- 0.08 mm Hg/ml/min, P less than .05, coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption and extraction did not change. Myocardial lactate extraction decreased, from 22 +/- 2 to 1 +/- 5%, P less than .05. The decrement in lactate extraction was not related to heart rate, but to the change in LV peak dp/dt, r = 0.74, P less than .05. Furthermore, with verapamil, 0.2 mg/kg, pretreatment, and 0.2 mg/kg, during the theophylline infusion, reduction in lactate extraction was blocked and LV peak dp/dt increased by 843 +/- 311 mm Hg/sec, P less than .05. Thus, at therapeutic concentrations, theophylline reduces myocardial lactate extraction, an effect that is associated with the absence of the expected inotropic actions of theophylline. However, when verapamil is administered with theophylline, a reduction of myocardial extraction does not occur and myocardial inotropy is enhanced.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to elucidate the cellular mechanism by which the mercurial diuretic mersalyl stimulates renin secretion in rabbit renal cortical slices in vitro. The stimulatory effect of mersalyl on renin secretion was rapid, reversible and concentration dependent. The stimulation was not dependent on the presence of ions such as Na+, Cl- and Ca++, and it was unaffected by inhibitors of Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransport, such as bumetanide and furosemide. However, the stimulation was blocked and reversed by thiols, such as L-cysteine and dithiothreitol. Furthermore, the maximal stimulatory effect of mersalyl on renin secretion was not additive to that produced by the non-diuretic mercurial sulfhydryl reagent P-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate nor to that produced by the non-mercurial diuretic sulfhydryl reagent, ethacrynic acid. These results support the hypothesis that mersalyl stimulates renin secretion by forming a reversible mercaptide bond with sulfhydryl groups, located perhaps on the plasma membrane of juxtaglomerular cells. These particular sulfhydryl groups appear to have no functional role in the diuretic action of mersalyl.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that ethanol blocks N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) responses in vitro. In the present study, evidence is provided that ethanol, when administered by the systemic route to rats, also inhibits NMDA-evoked electrophysiological activity in vivo at behaviorally relevant doses. Ethanol, at doses in rats ranging from those producing minimal changes in spontaneous behavioral activity (0.75 g/kg) to those producing marked suppression of behavioral activity (2.5 g/kg), produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the ability of NMDA, when iontophoresed onto neurons of the medial septum (MS), to activate MS neurons. However, at all doses of ethanol tested, a proportion of MS neurons responded to ethanol with essentially complete inhibition of NMDA-evoked activity, whereas other MS neurons responded to ethanol with little or no inhibition of NMDA-evoked activity. By way of comparison, MK-801, a non-competitive NMDA antagonist, antagonized NMDA-evoked activity in all MS neurons tested. In contrast to the actions of ethanol, MK-801 increased, rather than decreased, behavioral activity even at doses that completely inhibited NMDA-evoked activity in all MS neurons tested. These latter findings provide evidence that inhibition of NMDA-evoked activity cannot account for all of the behavioral effects of ethanol. In conclusion, while the present results demonstrate for the first time that ethanol can inhibit NMDA-evoked neuronal activity in vivo, they also indicate that additional neural actions must contribute to ethanol's pharmacological profile.\r"

Mean platelet/plasma concentration ratios were 533 for free norepinephrine, 502 for free epinephrine and 149 for free dopamine. Corresponding erythrocyte/plasma ratios were 1.04, 1.13 and 4.5, respectively. The presence of conjugated catecholamines in platelets and erythrocytes could be confirmed; however, their relative proportion within these cells, particularly in platelets, was lower than that in plasma. Upon intravenous infusion of dopamine for 3 hr at 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1, concentrations of free dopamine in plasma increased rapidly (280-970-fold), whereas conjugated dopamine only reached maximal values (14-19-fold increase) at 30 to 60 min after cessation of the infusion. The relative distribution of unconjugated dopamine in whole blood between plasma, platelets and erythrocytes changed from mean values of 1:0.33:3.7 at rest to 1:1.1:0.5 at the end of the infusion. As a result of the subsequent rapid decrease of dopamine in plasma and erythrocytes, this distribution was 1:17:1 shortly thereafter and remained constant up to the end of the investigation period. The relative distribution for conjugated dopamine of 1:0.001:0.5 at rest changed to about 1:0.2:0.1 at the termination of the infusion. Oral administration of norepinephrine and dopamine led to increases in the plasma concentrations of these amines in their conjugated forms only, whereas epinephrine concentrations remained constant. These elevations were not accompanied by corresponding increases in platelet and erythrocyte norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine contents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Guinea pigs were treated for 6 to 8 days by s.c. implantation of pellets, each containing a mixture of morphine base (120 mg) and morphine hydrochloride (35 mg). Each guinea pig received one pellet. Circular muscle-myenteric plexus preparations from the pretreated animals exhibited 6.1-fold tolerance to the inhibitory effects of morphine on nerve-mediated contractions of the circular muscle. Morphine-tolerant tissues were also tolerant to the inhibitory effects of another mu agonist, (D-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4,Gly5- ol)enkephalin (2.7-fold), the selective kappa agonist, dynorphin (4.0-fold), the adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (22-fold) and the adenosine receptor agonist, 2-chloroadenosine (43-fold). That is, tissues were tolerant to four inhibitory agents that acted via four distinct receptors. Tolerance therefore cannot be explained by a change in the opioid receptor that was occupied chronically by morphine. Nonspecific tolerance would result if an intracellular effector mechanism that was shared by each agonist was altered by morphine pellet implantation. Alternatively, tolerance could be a consequence of the neuronal hyperexcitability that is induced by chronic exposure to morphine. As such, inhibitory agents, irrespective of the receptors or intracellular mechanisms that they activate, may be less effective in reducing the excitability of myenteric neurons and hence less effective in decreasing transmitter release.\r"

Cocaine hydrochloride (16 and 32 mg) was injected or cocaine base (25 and 50 mg) was smoked. Heart rate, blood pressure, subjective effects and venous blood were sampled repeatedly. The potency of smoked cocaine was about 60% of that of i.v. cocaine, i.e., a 50-mg dose of smoked cocaine had effects similar to a 32-mg dose of i.v. cocaine. Cocaine plasma level increased after each dose up to 425 ng/ml with peaks observed 4 min after the second dose. Plasma levels 44 min after the first dose were similar to plasma levels seen 4 min after the first dose. Smoked and i.v. cocaine produced similar increases in heart rate, blood pressure and rate pressure product at similar cocaine venous plasma levels. VAS ratings of \"stimulated\" and \"high\" were greater at similar plasma levels after smoked cocaine compared to i.v. cocaine. In addition VAS ratings of cocaine \"liking\" were also greater for smoked than i.v. cocaine. Otherwise the subjective effects of smoked and i.v. cocaine were similar. The effects of specific cocaine plasma levels on cardiovascular activity and some subjective reports were diminished across the session, demonstrating the development of acute tolerance to cocaine.\r"

Animals were pretreated with indomethacin and (+/-)-propranolol to inhibit cyclooxygenase and beta adrenergic receptors, respectively, and pulmonary parameters were obtained with a Buxco pulmonary mechanics computer. Dose-dependent increases in pulmonary resistance and decreases in dynamic lung compliance were produced by serotonin, 2-methyl-serotonin, 5-methoxy-tryptamine, alpha-methyl-serotonin, 5-carboxamidotryptamine, and m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP). Responses to all agonists except 2-methyl-serotonin, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) agonist, were antagonized by the 5-HT2 antagonists, LY53857 and ketanserin. Zaclopride, 1 and 10 mg/kg, a selective 5-HT3 antagonist, blocked responses to 2-methyl-serotonin. A maximally effective dose of LY53857 (1 mg/kg) produced larger shifts of the dose-response curves to serotonin, 5-methoxytryptamine and alpha-methyl-serotonin than did a maximally effective dose of ketanserin (1 mg/kg). Thiorphan, 10 mg/kg, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase, potentiated 2-methyl-serotonin and, when studied in the presence of LY53857, also potentiated serotonin, 5-methoxytryptamine and TFMPP. After thiorphan and LY53857, responses to serotonin, but not 5-methoxytryptamine or TFMPP, were blocked by zaclopride. Capsaicin pretreatment of the animals resulted in rightward shifts of the dose-response curves to serotonin, 2-methyl-serotonin and TFMPP, but not to 5-methoxytryptamine or alpha-methyl-serotonin. Potentiation by thiorphan and antagonism by zaclopride of responses to serotonin were still evident after capsaicin pretreatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MK-801 inhibition of glutamate- or METH-evoked dopamine release might reduce synaptic dopamine levels during METH exposure and decrease the formation of 6-hydroxydopamine or other related neurotoxins. Without Mg++ present, 40 microM and 1 mM glutamate evoked a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated [3H]dopamine and [3H]metabolite (tritium) release of 3 to 6 and 12 to 16% of total tritium stores, respectively, from striatal slices. With 1.50 mM Mg++ present, 10 mM glutamate alone or in combination with the dopamine uptake blocker nomifensine released only 2.1 or 4.2%, respectively, of total tritium stores, and release was only partially dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors. With or without 1.50 mM Mg++ present, 0.5 or 5 microM METH evoked a substantial release of tritium (5-8 or 12-21% of total stores, respectively). METH-evoked dopamine release was not affected by 5 microM MK-801 but METH-evoked release was additive with glutamate-evoked release. Without Mg++ present, 1 mM glutamine increased glutamate release and induced the release of [3H]dopamine and metabolites. Both 0.5 and 5 microM METH also increased tritium release with 1 mM glutamine present. When striatal slices were exposed to 5 microM METH this glutamine-evoked release of glutamate was increased more than 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pre- and post-training and pre-retention test administration of DM-9384 attenuated the CXM-induced amnesia as indicated by prolongation of step-down latency. Aniracetam, another cyclic derivative of GABA, also showed antiamnesic effects. Scopolamine, a muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist, and the GABA antagonists, picrotoxin and bicuculline, all antagonized the antiamnesic effects of DM-9384. CXM decreased the number of GABAA and muscarinic ACh receptor binding sites. DM-9384 not only inhibited this effect but actually increased the latter. These results suggest that DM-9384 attenuates CXM-induced amnesia by interacting with GA-BAergic and AChergic neuronal systems and enhancing protein synthesis in the brain.\r"

Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (1 microM) was reduced in arteries of SHR compared with WKY. In the presence of the endothelium, the vessels of the two strains responded similarly to norepinephrine and NPY (100 nM) produced only a slight contraction. After removal of the endothelium, the response to norepinephrine was greater in WKY than in SHR. Furthermore, endothelium denudation enhanced markedly contraction elicited by NPY in WKY (up to 40% of the maximal effect of norepinephrine), but not in SHR. NPY potentiated the contractile response to low concentrations of norepinephrine (less than 300 nM) in both strains regardless whether the endothelium was intact or not. These results indicate that the contractile responses to NPY and to norepinephrine are inhibited by the endothelium in vessels of WKY, but not in those of the SHR. Furthermore, the potentiating effect of NPY occurs via an endothelium-independent mechanism in mesenteric arteries of both SHR and WKY. It is proposed that the differential responses between the two strains are related to abnormal function of the endothelium and to decreased responsiveness of smooth muscle cells in mesenteric resistance arteries of SHR compared to WKY.\r"

All hens were terminated after 30 days of treatment. Hens exposed to MiBK or n-hexane vapor did not exhibit any toxicity signs. In contrast, hens treated with EPN alone or in combination with n-hexane and/or MiBK developed acute cholinergic and delayed neurotoxicity signs. Hen brain acetylcholinesterase and neurotoxic esterase activities were inhibited in hens treated concurrently with EPN, n-hexane and MiBK.

To determine whether a similar mechanism mediates endothelium-dependent responses in mammalian veins, rings of canine femoral arteries and veins with and without endothelium were suspended for the measurement of isometric force in organ chambers. In femoral arteries, incubation of the rings with pertussis toxin (from Bordetella pertussis, 100 ng/ml for 2 hr) in the presence of indomethacin and propranolol did not reduce significantly endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and adenosine diphosphate, thrombin or the calcium ionophore A23187. However, endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist UK 14,304 were blocked by the pertussis toxin. In venous rings, endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were reduced by the toxin, whereas the endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by adenosine diphosphate, thrombin and A23187 were not affected. UK 14,304 contracted the veins; these contractions were augmented by removal of the endothelium. Pertussis toxin inhibited contractions to UK 14,304 in venous rings without but not with endothelium. Relaxations of arterial and venous smooth muscle to nitric oxide were unaffected by the toxin. Contractions to phenylephrine were not altered by either removal of the endothelium or the toxin in the arteries or veins.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the binding properties of various ETs in the brain of normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto) and hypertensive (spontaneously hypertensive) rats. [125I]ET 1 was prepared using the enzymobead lactoperoxidase method and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Membrane fractions were prepared from homogenates of various brain regions. A differential distribution of ET binding was found among the 14 brain regions studied. The cerebellum, brainstem and area postrema/nucleus tractus solitarius had the highest binding, whereas the cortex, pituitary and septum had the least binding. Competition experiments performed with hypothalamus, brainstem and cerebellum demonstrated different Ki values for the ET studied. ET 2 had the highest affinity with a Ki of 4 x 10(-1) M, whereas the ET analog, Ala3,11-ET 1, had the lowest affinity with a Ki of 3 x 10(-10) M. Saturation experiments indicated a single class of high-affinity receptors in cerebellar (Kd = 2.5 x 10(-11) M, maximal binding Bmax = 1.25 x 10(-12) mol/mg) and hypothalamic membranes (Kd = 1.9 x 10(-11) M, Bmax = 0.93 x 10(-12) mol/mg). No differences in Kd or Bmax were detected between Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats hypothalamic and cerebellar tissues. The results of this study suggest a role for ET in the brain, but revealed no differences between normotensive and hypertensive strains.\r"

The present study was therefore undertaken to examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects of cocaine by the inhalation route. Cannulated, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a constant concentration of cocaine vapor (13.6 +/- 0.4 micrograms cocaine per ml mainstream air), during which time their biodispositional profile and cardiovascular responses were evaluated. The bioavailable doses of cocaine were 0.26 +/- 0.05 and 1.54 +/- 0.46 mg/kg, after 1.5- and 5.0-min exposures, respectively. Peak cocaine plasma concentrations of 95 +/- 26 and 205 +/- 58 ng/ml, for the 1.5- and 5.0-min exposures, respectively, occurred 1 min after the start of exposure. Increasing the duration of exposure significantly increased the bioavailability from 0.29 to 1.03 (P less than .05). Transient changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure were generally dose-dependent and correlated temporally with peak cocaine plasma concentrations. During exposure, 70% of the animals demonstrated electrophysiological aberrations consistent with atrial arrhythmia and incomplete heart block. These findings suggest that a direct cardiotoxic effect resulted from inhalation of cocaine.\r"

CI-949 was administered by gavage to rats at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day for 14 consecutive days. A vehicle control and two positive controls (cyclosporine A and cyclophosphamide) were run concurrently. CI-949 at 100 mg/kg/day decreased body weight gain and was lethal to 5 of 40 rats. The deaths occurred between days 5 and 12 of study. This overtly toxic dose did not alter splenic cellularity or change the percentages of T- and B-lymphocyte subpopulations. Additionally, CI-949 did not inhibit lymphocyte proliferation or hinder clearance of sRBC by the reticuloendothelial system. Antibody-forming cell response after immunization showed a dose-related increase in the number of immunoglobulin M secreting cells. Based on the results of these assays, the immune system does not appear to be adversely affected by CI-949 even at high doses.\r"

When incubated with neuroblastoma cells, experimental compounds A-4, A-5 and HC-3 inhibit choline metabolism. Over a 24-hr incubation, A-4, A-5 and HC-3 produced a significant decrease in total choline accumulation, choline incorporation into phospholipid and free choline content. However, despite decreases in choline incorporation into phospholipid, no change occurred in content of phosphatidylcholine. Treatment of cells with A-4, A-5 and HC-3 resulted in an increase in the incorporation of S-adenosyl-methionine into phosphatidylcholine. However, the incorporation of ethanolamine or serine into phosphatidylcholine was not increased. Phosphatidylcholine turnover was decreased in cells treated with A-4 and A-5. A-4, A-5 and HC-3 produce significant decreases in choline metabolism; however, the cells are able to maintain membrane integrity by decreasing turnover of phosphatidylcholine and increasing phosphatidylcholine synthesis through the methylation pathway.

The plasma concentrations of free glutathione and total glutathione (i.e., glutathione in small molecular and protein mixed disulfides) did not change significantly during 8 hr after the ingestion of OTC. In contrast, there was a significant increase in the average concentration of cysteine from 0.37 to 0.99 nmol/mg of protein and of glutathione from 8.7 to 15.6 nmol/mg of protein in lymphocytes 2 to 3 hr after ingestion of OTC. The present data shows that OTC is a prodrug of cysteine after p.o. administration in humans and that OTC can raise the circulating concentration of cysteine and the intracellular concentration of cysteine and glutathione in lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The proposition that tonic nociception models are more analogous to clinical pain than traditional acute models prompted our previous development of a modified mouse paw formalin test. To discern possible modulatory roles and site(s) of action of endogenous opioid systems, the receptor-preferring agonists sufentanil (mu), U-50,488H (kappa) and [D-Pen2,5]enkephalin (DPDPE, delta) were evaluated for antinociceptive activity in the formalin paradigm by systemic (except DPDPE), spinal and supraspinal routes. All observations were done under blind conditions. Doses causing overt behaviors that indicated a breach of receptor specificity (during the observation period) were rejected. Higher doses of centrally administered DPDPE (greater than 0.3 micrograms/mouse, intrathecal; greater than 3 micrograms/mouse, intracerebroventricular) induced a behavioral syndrome traditionally associated with mu agonism, and thus were not considered for this study. A50 values from behaviorally acceptable dose ranges for mean percent analgesia (reduction of paw licking compared to controls) were: trans-(+/- )-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[U-50,488H 2-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate,U-50,488H--3200 nmol/kg, subcutaneous, 1100 nmol/kg, intrathecal and 314 nmol/kg, intracerebroventricular; sufentanil--11.1 nmol/kg, subcutaneous, 8.6 nmol/kg, intrathecal; and DPDPE--inactive. On the basis of our dose-response data, we suggest that, in mice, kappa and mu, but not delta, opioid receptors modulate tonic pain perception at both spinal and supraspinal loci. The results also support inclusion of the modified formalin test in preclinical evaluations of potential kappa agonists.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of clofilium and its tertiary homolog, LY97119 (LY), on K+ currents in isolated ventricular myocytes from adult rat were examined using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Acute exposure (less than 30 min) to high concentrations of clofilium (30-100 microM) produced a slowly developing reduction in the peak of the transient outward current (Ito) and an apparent increase in the rate of current inactivation. In addition, inhibition exhibited a marked dependence on the frequency of stimulation (i.e., use-dependent inhibition). For \"short\" exposure times (i.e., less than 30 min), steady-state inhibition was not attained. Therefore, myocytes were preincubated with clofilium for at least 3 hr before use. Under these conditions, the median inhibitory concentration for steady-state use-dependent inhibition of Ito was 0.5 microM. Recovery of Ito from use-dependent inhibition followed a biexponential time course; tau fast = 75 msec, tau slow = 17 sec. The relative magnitude of the slow component (but not its time constant) increased with higher clofilium concentrations. LY, like clofilium, also induced a time-dependent inhibition of Ito (median inhibiting concentration 0.9 microM). However, unlike clofilium, steady state with LY was reached within 5 min. Furthermore, LY (3 microM) produced very little use-dependent inhibition (29% at 1 Hz compared with 92% for clofilium). This is possibly due to a \"fast\" unbinding rate upon repolarization (tau = 1.8 s). In contrast to clofilium, LY (1-10 microM) also inhibited the inward rectifier (IK1). The present results suggest that inhibition of Ito may contribute to clofilium's class III antiarrhythmic action.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the ability of two new, selective antagonists of the gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) receptor, phaclofen (PHAC) and 2-hydroxy-saclofen (2-OH-S), to antagonize the increase in tail-flick latency (TFL) and hot-plate latency (HPL) produced by i.t. administered baclofen (BAC) in the rat. The putative GABAB receptor antagonist delta-aminovaleric acid (DAVA) was also examined for comparative purposes. Intrathecal (i.t.) pretreatment with increasing doses of PHAC (10-100 micrograms) shifted the dose-effect relationship of i.t. administered BAC progressively to the right in a parallel manner in both the tail-flick (TF) and hot-plate (HP) test. Schild analysis of the data yielded an apparent pA2 value of 7.3 +/- 0.1 and a slope of -0.98 +/- 0.14. By comparison, PHAC did not antagonize the increase in HPL produced by i.t. injection of the serotonin1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin. These observations indicate that PHAC competitively and selectively antagonizes BAC and further suggest that the antinociceptive effects of i.t. administered BAC are mediated by the PHAC-sensitive subtype of the GABAB receptor. Intrathecal injection of PHAC alone did not decrease TFL or HPL, suggesting that spinal GABAB receptors involved in nociception are not tonically activated. Although i.t. pretreatment with 2-OH-S (10-30 micrograms) also antagonized the antinociceptive effects of i.t. administered BAC, increasing doses of 2-OH-S did not produce progressive, rightward shifts in the dose-effect relationship of BAC. Indeed, i.t. administration of 2-OH-S alone modestly increased TFL, but not HPL in the rat. These observations suggest that 2-OH-S may be a partial agonist at spinal GABAB receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Output of epinephrine and norepinephrine was determined from adrenal venous blood by using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. SNS (1 and 3 Hz) produced increases in catecholamine output in a frequency-dependent manner. Intravenous administration of pirenzepine (10-100 micrograms/kg), a selective M1 receptor antagonist, or AF-DX 116 (30-300 micrograms/kg) and gallamine (0.3-3 mg/kg), selective M2 receptor antagonists, did not modify the SNS-induced increases in catecholamine output. C6 (hexamethonium) inhibited the SNS-induced increases in catecholamine output partially in a dose of 1 mg/kg and remarkably in a dose of 10 mg/kg. The combination of C6 (1 mg/kg) with pirenzepine (10 micrograms/kg), AF-DX 116 (30 micrograms/kg) or gallamine (0.3 mg/kg) inhibited the SNS-induced increases in catecholamine output more potently than C6 did by itself. The inhibition by C6 alone was about 50%, but that by each combination reached to about 80%. These results suggest that M2 receptors as well as M1 receptors play a facilitatory role in catecholamine release from the adrenal gland in response to SNS when the nicotinic receptor-mediated mechanism is partially inhibited.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an unusually potent lipid autacoid with a variety of biological activities. The growing body of evidence suggests that PAF might play an important role in modulation of central nervous system function, particularly during ischemia- and trauma-induced neuronal damage. However, the mechanisms involved in PAF actions on neuronal or other brain cells is virtually unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to characterize PAF receptor-mediated cellular signal transduction in neurohybrid NG108-15 cells with the aid of a new potent PAF antagonist, BN 50739. PAF induced an immediate and concentration-dependent increase in [Ca++]i with an EC50 of 6.8 nM. PAF-induced [Ca++]i mobilization was inhibited by several structurally unrelated PAF antagonists such as BN 50739, WEB 2086, SRI 63-441 and BN 52021, in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 4.8, 6.9, 809 and 98500 nM, respectively. The calcium channel blockers nifedipine (5 microM) and diltiazem (10 microM) had no effect on the PAF-induced increase in [Ca++]i, but omission of CA++ from the incubation buffer caused an 82% reduction of PAF-induced [Ca++]i elevation; the remainder contributed from intracellular sources was completely inhibited by 10 microM TMB-8, an intracellular Ca++ blocker. NG108-15 cells exhibited homologous desensitization to sequential addition of PAF, but no heterologous desensitization between PAF and other agonists such as bradykinin, endothelin, angiotensin II and ATP was observed. PAF stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 5.1 nM for IP3 formation, which was also inhibited by the PAF antagonist BN 50739 in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 3.6 nM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the present studies we sought to determine if cicletanine, which is an antihypertensive agent of unknown mechanism, could alter cGMP metabolism via inhibition of cGMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) in vascular smooth muscle. Cicletanine was determined to be a mixed (competitive, noncompetitive) inhibitor of both calmodulin-regulated and cGMP-specific PDEs from monkey aortic smooth muscle with Ki values of 450 to 700 microM. Cicletanine also potentiated vasorelaxation by the guanylate cyclase activators sodium nitroprusside and atrial natriuretic peptide in isolated rat aortas. Potentiation was not dependent upon the contractile agonists nor was it indomethacin-sensitive. Neither potentiation nor inhibition of cGMP PDEs was stereoselective. Methylene blue attenuated a component of cicletanine-induced vasorelaxation, but did not completely obviate relaxation. Both cicletanine and the cGMP-PDE inhibitor zaprinast potentiated sodium nitroprusside-mediated cGMP formation and relaxation, although the increase in cGMP content was markedly greater with zaprinast compared to cicletanine. In further studies, cicletanine did not potentiate cGMP activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, but did inhibit calmodulin-activated myosin light chain kinase and protein kinase C at relatively high concentrations (approximately 1 mM). In summary, these data demonstrate that cicletanine inhibits vascular cGMP PDEs, potentiates vasorelaxation, and to a limited extent, cGMP formation by guanylate cyclase activators in vascular smooth muscle. However, these relationships for cicletanine are dissimilar from the reference cGMP PDE inhibitor, zaprinast. Thus, other mechanisms may also contribute to the vasorelaxant action of cicletanine.\r"

Binding studies using the radioligands pirenzepine, cis-dioxolane and quinuclidinyl benzilate in rat cerebral cortex and quinuclidinyl benzilate in cerebellar homogenates indicated that AF102B was a potent and highly selective M1-type muscarinic probe, being more selective for M1 receptors than oxotremorine, carbachol and AF102A (the trans-isomer of AF102B). AF102B had a 3-fold higher apparent affinity for M1 receptors than the prototype M1 agonist, McN-A-343, cis- and trans-AF30 (other rigid analogs of acetylcholine). Treatment of rat cortical homogenates with Cu++ ions did not modify the affinity observed for the muscarinic antagonists atropine, scopolamine and pirenzepine, whereas increasing the proportion of high affinity sites for the agonists oxotremorine-M, carbachol and McN-A-343. The apparent affinity of AF102B also increased by Cu++ treatment suggesting that this compound interacts with rat cerebral cortex muscarinic receptors as an agonist. AF102B did not affect high affinity choline transport, choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activities in rat brain preparations. In rats treated with AF64A (the cholinotoxin ethylcholine aziridinium ion; 3 nmol/2 microliters/side i.c.v.), AF102B (1 mg/kg p.o. or i.p.), AF102A (1 mg/kg i.p.), cis-AF30 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and physostigmine (0.06 mg/kg i.p.), each reversed cognitive impairments in a step-through passive avoidance task. Both AF102B and AF102A (1 mg/kg i.p.), but not physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg i.p.), were effective also in reversing reference memory impairments in a Morris water maze test. Repetitive administrations of AF102B (0.2 mg/kg/day i.p.) improved AF64A-induced working memory deficits in the Morris water maze test, but did not affect open field behavior. The data show that the selective M1 agonist AF102B can restore AF64A-induced cognitive impairments, without producing adverse central and peripheral side effects at the effective doses and this can indicate its potential use for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to elucidate possible therapeutic effects of naftidrofuryl on the brain glucose metabolism after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia was induced by injecting 680 microspheres with a diameter of 48 microns into the right internal carotid artery of the rat. After ensuring the onset of symptoms of stroke on the first day after the operation, the rats were treated with intraperitoneal injections of 15 mg/kg naftidrofuryl oxalate twice a day. The behavioral and metabolic changes of operated rats were monitored up to the 5th day after surgery. The symptoms gradually faded away, from the 3rd day on, after microsphere-induced cerebral embolism. Tissue glucose and glycogen greatly increased after cerebral embolism, suggesting embolism-induced inhibition of glycolysis. To elucidate which steps in the glycolytic catabolism are inhibited after cerebral ischemia, biochemical activities of the glycolytic enzymes in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle were determined on the 3rd day after surgery. Enzyme activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were not inhibited, but rather increased slightly after cerebral embolism. Malate dehydrogenase activity in the brain mitochondria was markedly increased after microsphere-embolism, whereas other enzyme activities in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were never inhibited by the cerebral embolism. Treatment of naftidrofuryl resulted in an appreciable reverse of the brain glucose and glycogen levels and a substantial recovery of altered enzyme activities to normal levels in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood samples for determination of plasma warfarin and diltiazem concentrations, the prothrombin time and complete urine collections were obtained for determination of urinary excretion of dehydrowarfarin, 4'-hydroxywarfarin, 6-hydroxywarfarin, 7-hydroxywarfarin, 8-hydroxywarfarin and unchanged parent drug for 216 h after each dose. Concurrent diltiazem administration decreased total racemic warfarin clearance (+/- S.D.) [3.60 +/- 0.99 (control) versus 3.19 +/- 0.86 (diltiazem) ml/min; P less than .05]. Disposition of the more potent anticoagulant S-warfarin was not altered by diltiazem treatment. In contrast total clearance of R-warfarin was decreased [3.47 +/- 1.10 (control) versus 2.77 +/- 0.92 ml/min; P less than .05]. No change in the area under the prothrombin time versus time after warfarin administration curve was associated with diltiazem treatment for any warfarin trial. Inhibition of R-warfarin by diltiazem was regioselective for metabolites as determined by fractional clearance of urinary metabolites. R-6-hydroxywarfarin clearance (+/- S.E.) [29.5 +/- 7.2 (control) versus 15.7 +/- 2.8 ml/h; P less than 0.05] and R-8-hydroxywarfarin clearance [21.1 +/- 3.6 (control) versus 11.2 +/- 2.0 ml/h; P less than .05] were selectively decreased with no significant change in the urinary clearance of R-dehydro, R-4-hydroxy and R-7-hydroxywarfarin. Urinary clearance of unchanged R-warfarin was also decreased during diltiazem administration. Diltiazem inhibits warfarin disposition in humans in a stereospecific and regiospecific manner.\r"

  ".W": "Desensitization of the contractile response mediated by the 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptor in the isolated guinea-pig trachea and rabbit aorta is a time-dependent process and therefore it has been characterized by an apparent rate constant obtained from a kinetic analysis. Under similar conditions, desensitization of the response in the trachea is 7-fold faster than in the aorta. Desensitization is homologous and reversible and is not affected by inhibition of neuronal and extraneuronal uptake, monoamine oxidase activity, alpha 1 adrenergic, cholinergic muscarinic or histamine H1 receptors. Desensitization does not depend on removal of epithelium from the trachea or endothelium and adventitia from the aorta or on the release of a stable relaxant factor. It is also not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca++, which is needed for tonic contraction. The dependence of desensitization on agonist concentration, number of receptors and the intrinsic activity of the agonist was determined. The observed values of the rate constants for desensitization and of the peak tension (T peak) in trachea show a saturable dependence on the concentration of 5-HT, indicating that occupancy of the 5-HT2 receptor is needed for desensitization. The less efficacious agonists, N-methyl serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, quipazine, 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-methyltryptamine, 5-methoxy dimethyltryptamine, 4-hydroxytryptamine and bufotenine induce significantly slower desensitization than 5-HT. A 25 to 75% reduction in 5-HT2 receptor number by alkylation had no effect on the observed rate constants for desensitization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These studies demonstrated that SCH 39166 binds to the D-1 receptor in vitro and inhibits the rat conditioned avoidance response, a test predictive of antipsychotic activity. The current study demonstrates that SCH 39166 inhibits the in vivo binding of [125I]SCH 38840 to D-1 receptors in rat striatal tissue with an ED50 of 11.67 nmol/animal or 0.016 mg/kg s.c. SCH 39166 did not inhibit the in vivo binding of [125I]SCH 38840 to rat frontal cortex, suggesting that, unlike other D-1 antagonists, SCH 39166 was not binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2 receptors in vivo. The in vivo binding of SCH 39166 to D-2 receptors was studied using [3H]raclopride and demonstrated that SCH 39166 did not bind to D-2 receptors up to doses of 100 mumol/animal or approximately 150 mg/kg s.c. Further studies to determine the in vivo selectivity of SCH 39166 utilized N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) to inactivate selected neurotransmitter receptors. Preadministration of SCH 39166, at doses as low as 0.01 mg/kg s.c., produced a statistically significant protection of D-1 receptors from EEDQ inactivation. SCH 39166 produced a similar protection of 5-HT2 receptors only at the highest dose tested, 10 mg/kg s.c., whereas there was no protection of D-2 sites even at this high dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Low doses (less than 10 nmol) of 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT elicited significant elevations of arterial pressure and heart rate. At doses greater than 10 nmol, 5-HT produced pressor responses attended by significant reductions of heart rate whereas 8-OH-DPAT produced significant depressor and bradycardiac responses. Concurrent i.c.v. administration of the nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist, methiothepin, abolished the cardiovascular responses to a low (1 nmol) and a high (100 nmol) dose of 5-HT and a low (3 nmol) dose of 8-OH-DPAT. In contrast, methiothepin cotreatment did not prevent the reductions of arterial pressure and heart rate induced by a high (100 nmol) dose of 8-OH-DPAT. These results suggest that stimulation of central nervous system 5-HT1A receptors with low doses of 8-OH-DPAT produces cardiovascular activation.\r"

Drugs were injected intraperitoneally in rats for 2 or 3 weeks, and biochemical determinations were made 4 to 72 hr after the final dose. Chronic treatments with desimipramine, ipsapirone and fluoxetine did not induce any change in the 5-HT1A-induced inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast, chronic treatment with clorgyline and electroconvulsive shock treatment induced a slight but significant reduction of 5-HT's ability to inhibit hippocampal adenylyl cyclase. This indicates that, at least in hippocampal neurons, the 5-HT1A receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase is not easily desensitized. This was verified in vitro on murine hippocampal neurons in culture, by measuring the effects of intense stimulation (1 and 2 hours), with 5-HT, ipsapirone and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. Indeed, such stimulations did not significantly affect the 5-HT1A receptor-induced inhibition of cAMP production in these hippocampal neurons in culture. Our results indicate that it is not the post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor of hippocampus that is modified during antidepressant treatments, at least at the level of its coupling to adenylyl cyclase.\r"

The inotropic efficacy of epinine was significantly higher than that of dopamine in adult ventricular and papillary muscles, it was similar to that of dopamine in juvenile myocardial preparations and in adult atria and pectinate muscles. The dopamine-evoked response was significantly more sensitive to practolol than epinine-evoked response, but it was less sensitive to ICI 118,551. pA2 values of practolol and ICI 118,551 were considerably different with epinine but not with dopamine as agonist.

Lidocaine p.o. (15-30 mg/kg) did not increase activity. Relating the area under the curve measures for serum cocaine (concentration-time) and LM activity (LM activity-time) for 2 hr postadministration indicated that cocaine was about twice as potent i.p., compared to p.o., in increasing LM activity. Cocaine (i.p. and p.o.) produced dose-related decrements in both discriminative motor control performance and in task work rate, whereas lidocaine p.o. did not. The motor control decrements produced by cocaine were approximately comparable by i.p. and p.o. routes, whereas effects on LM rates were much greater by i.p. than by p.o. administration. The effects of cocaine by both routes on LM rates were proportionally much greater than its effect on motor control performance. Changes in LM rates and motor control performance over the postadministration period were related to the pharmacokinetic features (maximum serum concentration, time to maximum serum concentration and elimination half-life) of cocaine observed for the routes explored (i.p., p.o. and s.c.). Tail-tip serum samples, although yielding conservative estimates of cocaine concentration, correlated well with trunk serum and brain cocaine levels.\r"

Sensitization developed. At the highest levels of self-administered oral cocaine (about 80 mg/kg), post-administration serum cocaine levels remained undiminished for the activity-session period, as did the large-movement activities of most animals, indicating no development of acute tolerance. Rats receiving repeated doses of oral cocaine (15 mg/kg) showed discriminative motor control deficits as well as increases in work rate. These changes were dose-related in animals self-administering oral cocaine under the schedule-induction procedure. Upon withdrawal of cocaine from the schedule-induction animals, motor behavior returned to precocaine base-line performance for most animals. The behavior of the animal with the largest cocaine intake did not return. After a schedule-induced oral cocaine intake session, the tail-tip and trunk serum measures for cocaine and its metabolites were approximately equivalent, while brain cocaine and norcocaine levels remained markedly elevated over serum values.\r"

  ".W": "The effects on ventricular function of calcium channel blockers and isoproterenol were studied in isovolumically beating perfused control rabbit hearts and in hearts subjected to a double pressure plus volume overload studied at the early phase of heart failure. In control hearts, isoproterenol produced an increase of systolic ventricular function and relaxation that was maximal at 10(-7) M. In failing hearts, inotropic state increase in response to isoproterenol was significantly smaller (P less than .01) with no observed lusitropic effect. In control hearts, verapamil and diltiazem produced dose-dependent decreases of ventricular function which were larger with verapamil than with diltiazem (median drug concentration50 of developed pressure was, respectively, 1163 +/- 131 nM and 4524 +/- 451 nM, P less than .001). In failing hearts, contractility decrease was larger than in control hearts (median drug concentration50 of developed pressure was 604 +/- 69 nM and 2691 +/- 580 nM with verapamil and diltiazem, respectively). In contrast, Ro 40-5967, a new calcium-channel blocker, did not produce reductions of inotropic state with concentrations up to 10(-5) M. All three calcium-channel blockers produced a 2-fold increase of coronary flow at 10(-6) M. We conclude that the deleterious effect of verapamil and diltiazem in heart failure is due, at least in part, to a direct depressant effect of these drugs on contractility, which is larger than in control hearts. Additionally, the in vivo sympathetic compensation is probably reduced, as indicated by the decreased ventricular responsiveness to isoproterenol.\r"

The concentration-EEG effect relationships of four benzodiazepine agonists, flunitrazepam, midazolam, oxazepam and clobazam, were quantified in individual rats and correlated with receptor affinity and anticonvulsant effect intensity of these compounds. Male Wistar-derived rats received a single i.v. dose of flunitrazepam (2.5 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg), oxazepam (10 mg/kg) and clobazam (20 mg/kg). Arterial blood samples were drawn frequently and EEG was monitored continuously until it had returned to preadministration levels. The concentrations of the benzodiazepines were determined by chromatographic means. Plasma protein binding was determined at 37 degrees C by ultrafiltration. The amplitudes in the 11.5 to 30 Hz frequency range, determined by aperiodic analysis, was used as EEG effect measure. Concentration-EEG effect relationships were derived by a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling procedure and characterized by the sigmoidal Emax model. The EC50 based on free drug concentrations (EC50,U, mean +/- S.E.) calculated for flunitrazepam (4.2 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) and midazolam (3.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) were similar and significantly less than the values for oxazepam (49 +/- 4 ng/ml) and clobazam (277 +/- 34 ng/ml) and illustrates the importance of using parameters referenced to unbound drug for comparative purposes. The maximal responses (Emax) for midazolam, oxazepam and clobazam were significantly less than for flunitrazepam suggesting that these three drugs may be regarded as partial agonists when compared to flunitrazepam. Receptor affinity was determined based on displacement of [3H] flumazenil in a washed brain homogenate at 37 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The objectives of this study were: 1) to investigate the biologic fate of AZT using whole-body autoradiography; and 2) to compare the biologic fate of AZT with that of the parent molecule thymidine (dThd). Male Sprague-Dawley mice were given (intravenously) a tracer dose of [2-14C]AZT (273 microCi/kg) or [2-14C]dThd (218 microCi/kg). Treated animals were sacrificed at various time periods (2 min, 5 min, 4 hr and 24 hr) and processed for whole-body autoradiography. Tissue distribution of radioactivity in the autoradiographs was quantitated using computer-aided image analysis. The elimination of AZT and dThd was also examined by radiochemical analyses of urine, feces and expired air of treated animals over a 24-hr period. Twenty-four hr following AZT treatment, the radioactivity excreted in urine, feces and in exhaled air (as 14CO2) accounted for 86, 4.6 and 3.7% of the dose, respectively. Within 2 min after administration of AZT, maximum radioactivity was detected in the kidney. The brain, spinal cord and testes were conspicuous because of virtual lack of radioactivity. All other parenchymatous organs (liver, lung, heart and spleen) had apparent similar levels of radioactivity that were higher than those in the connective tissues. At a later time period (4 hr), the radioactivity in most organs was eliminated except in the renal medulla, contents of gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder and mouth cavity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The anticancer drug adriamycin (ADR) induces severe nonselective glomerular proteinuria in rats. The proliferation of the glomerular mesangium in chronic ADR nephrosis suggests a disturbed metabolism of extracellular matrix proteins. In the present study the structural protein fibronectin was analyzed by immunological methods in urine and plasma in two rat strains after a single injection of 5 mg of ADR/kg b.wt. After ADR administration the excretion of 220 kd-plasma fibronectin, identified by its electrophoretic mobility and Western blotting, increased. This was confirmed by quantitative measurement (ELISA) of total urinary fibronectin (ADR-treated Munich Wistar Fromter rats: 85.4 +/- 49.5 ng/hr, N = 31; controls: 1.7 +/- 0.7 ng/hr, N = 26; day 7 after ADR injection). Control urines contained distinct fragments of fibronectin with a molecular weight range of 40 to 60 kd. It is suggested that these fragments did not originate from plasma inasmuch as only little correspondence between the fibronectin patterns of urine and plasma was found, and also because in ADR-treated rats the excretion of the fibronectin fragments decreased from day 4 of ADR administration. The data suggest that the urinary fibronectin fragments are released from cellular fibronectin during the normal catabolism of the glomerular extracellular matrices, and that ADR interferes in the metabolism of matrix components. Only as a consequence of an enhanced glomerular permeability is plasma fibronectin excreted in ADR-treated rats.\r"

  ".U": "91211086\r", 
  ".W": "In anesthetized normotensive rats, 45 degrees head-up tilt induced a transient marked drop followed by a long-lasting slight drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP), and with cessation of tilt there is a transient pressor response. Heart rate (HR) did not change appreciably by tilting. Bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries (BCO) induced pressor responses with tachycardia. Physostigmine (5 and 15 micrograms i.c.v.) attenuated the tilt-induced decreases in MAP. Neither the HR during tilt nor the restoration-related transient pressor response was altered by physostigmine. Acetylcholine (ACh, 5 micrograms i.c.v.) exhibited a similar attenuation of tilt-induced changes in MAP. Physostigmine enhanced BCO-induced pressor responses whereas not affecting BCO-induced HR responses. The time for onset of these changes in arterial pressure was slower than that of physostigmine-induced pressor response. Depletion of brain ACh with hemicholinium-3 (20 micrograms i.c.v.) or its derivative A-5 (20 micrograms i.c.v.) or blockade of muscarinic-receptors with atropine (1 microgram i.c.v.) blocked physostigmine-elicited modulation of both tilt- and BCO-induced reflexes. These results suggest involvement of central cholinergic systems for modulation not only of BCO-induced but also tilt-induced cardiovascular reflexes. In particular, ACh appears to enhance these reflexes by acting within the central nervous system.\r"

Cocaine, 4 mg/kg i.v., reduced SNA by 55 +/- 6%, but did not significantly affect BP or HR. Cocaine, in doses that were ineffective by the i.v. route, was administered into the vertebral artery and produced decreases in SNA, BP and HR in anesthetized cats. Administration of cocaine into the carotid artery was without effect. Topical administration of cocaine to the intermediate area of the ventrolateral medullary surface (25 micrograms/side) evoked hypotension and bradycardia. Nisoxetine, an inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake, applied bilaterally to the intermediate area (30 micrograms/side) exerted a similar hypotensive effect. Lidocaine administered in doses equivalent to those of cocaine had no significant effect on SNA when given i.v. or on BP when given into the vertebral artery. These results indicate that cocaine inhibits central sympathetic outflow and that the site of action appears to be in the hindbrain at a site that is reached by placement of the drug at the intermediate area of the ventrolateral medulla. The data also indicate that the mechanism of action of cocaine to inhibit sympathetic outflow may be unrelated to its local anesthetic action and may involve inhibition of catecholamine uptake in the ventrolateral medulla.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha adrenoceptor agonists have been reported to increase contractile force and to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange in the heart. We studied the influence of hexamethylamiloride (HMA), a selective inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, on the positive inotropic action of phenylephrine in isolated, paced rat left atria (3 microM propranolol). HMA (10 microM) blocked the ouabain-induced contracture, an event dependent on Na+ uptake via the Na+/H+ exchanger. The same concentration of HMA prevented 50% of the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine (10 microM), but had no effect on base-line developed force. HMA reduced the maximal effect (234 +/- 19 vs. 117 +/- 20% increase of base-line), but not the EC50 (4.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.6 +/- 2 microM) of phenylephrine. Phenylephrine (100 microM) caused both a leftward and upward shift of the Ca++ concentration-effect curve, but only a leftward shift, in the additional presence of HMA (3 microM). It is known that lithium, but not choline, will exchange for H+ via the Na+/H+ exchanger: phenylephrine's (100 microM) positive inotropic effect in choline-substituted solutions averaged 37% of that in lithium-substituted solutions. The positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine was amplified by ouabain (200 microM). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that alpha adrenoceptor agonists produce their positive inotropic effects, in part, via stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange. Such stimulation could cause an intracellular alkalinization and (in the presence of ouabain), elevated intracellular Na+.\r"

DAMGO [0.004-0.015 micrograms] injected into ROb, also dose-dependently, inhibited the tail-flick response but reached a plateau of 60 to 80% inhibition at high doses (greater than 0.015 micrograms). Morphine (10-60 micrograms) injected into ROb produced only a small inhibition (less than 20% inhibition) even at high doses (greater than 60 micrograms). The rank order of potency of these opioids on the tail-flick inhibition was DAMGO greater than beta-endorphin greater than morphine. Morphine (1-10 micrograms) and DAMGO (0.004-0.03 micrograms) microinjected into GiA produced dose-dependent inhibitions of the tail-flick response and high doses of these two mu agonists fully inhibited the tail-flick response. However, beta-endorphin (0.1-10 micrograms) injected into GiA produced a small but dose-dependent inhibition of the tail-flick response (less than 60% inhibition). The rank order of potency of these opioids on the tail-flick inhibition was DAMGO greater than beta-endorphin greater than morphine. The inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by beta-endorphin (2 micrograms) microinjected into ROb was blocked by the coadministration of beta-endorphin-[1-27] (6 micrograms), but not naloxone (1 microgram).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nonprimate species are ordinarily resistant to the accumulation of formate and the associated metabolic and visual toxicity. A nonprimate model of methanol-induced visual toxicity was developed using rats treated with subanesthetic concentrations of nitrous oxide to inhibit the oxidation of methanol's toxic metabolite, formic acid. Methanol-intoxicated rats developed formic acidemia, metabolic acidosis and visual toxicity within 36 hr of methanol administration analogous to the human methanol poisoning syndrome. Visual dysfunction was measured as reductions in the flash-evoked cortical potential and electroretinogram, which occurred coincident with blood formate accumulation. Alterations in the electroretinogram occurred at formate concentrations lower than those associated with other visual changes and provide functional evidence of direct retinal toxicity in methanol poisoning.\r"

Streptozotocin was injected into Wistar rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). Six weeks after the injection diabetic rats showed a subsensitivity to beta adrenergic stimulation in ventricular tissue and a supersensitivity and hyper-responsiveness to Ca++ and alpha adrenergic stimulation (except in WKYs) in ventricular tissues and left atria. A supersensitivity to BAY K 8644 in SHR left atria and a hyper-responsiveness to verapamil in ventricular strips were also noted. These alterations may be due to a change in receptor number or to postreceptor alterations. Diabetic SHRs exhibited greater changes in several of the drug responses (responses to isoproterenol, phenylephrine and BAK 8644) were more hyperlipidemic and had a high mortality as compared with Wistar rats and WKY diabetics. These findings confirm that the combination of hypertension and diabetes results in greater cardiac pathology than is seen with either disease alone.\r"

Acute administration of morphine sulfate (0.01 or 0.20 mg/kg i.v.) produced a naloxone antagonizable increase in locomotion and a corresponding increase in the discharge rates of Type A dopamine neurons. Morphine sulfate led to a relatively long-latency (120-200 sec) loss of spontaneous discharge activity in the majority of Type B dopamine neurons and this was blocked by a high dose of naloxone (5.0 mg/kg). Naloxone (0.10 or 5.0 mg/kg i.v.), combined with morphine, led to a paradoxical behavioral suppression. These data suggest that morphine produces opposite effects on two functionally distinct subtypes of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and that behavioral output may reflect an interaction between these changes in discharge activity in mesencephalic dopamine pathways.\r"

In monkeys, dose-effect curves were determined before, during and after the termination of a chronic regimen in which monkeys received 6.0 mg/kg/day of morphine. In morphine-pretreated rats, dose-effect curves for the opioid antagonists naloxone, naltrexone and diprenorphine shifted to the left of those determined when rats were not morphine-pretreated; whereas those for the mu-opioid agonists morphine and I-methadone and mixed-action opioids nalorphine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, pentazocine and bremazocine were unaltered. During chronic morphine administration in rats, dose-effect curves for morphine and butorphanol shifted to the right; whereas the dose-effect curves for naloxone and nalorphine shifted to the left of those determined when rats were not treated with morphine. The effects of pentazocine, nalbuphine, bremazocine and the kappa-opioid agonist U50,488 were unaltered in morphine-maintained rats. In morphine-maintained monkeys, the dose-effect curves for morphine and I-methadone shifted to the right; whereas those for naloxone, nalorphine and nalbuphine shifted to the left of the prechronic dose-effect curves. Dose-effect curves for butorphanol, pentazocine and U50,488 were unaltered. Overall, these results suggest that the chronic morphine administration procedure can be used to distinguish opioid compounds based upon their relative mu agonist and antagonist activity.\r"

A direct action of XQN (1-30 microM) on the contractile machinery of cardiac myofilaments was demonstrated in chemically skinned fiber preparations from guinea pig papillary muscles. In atrial preparations, the XQN-induced inotropic effect was markedly inhibited by verapamil or nifedipine, but was not affected by practolol, chlorpheniramine, cimetidine, tetrodotoxin or reserpine. The Ca++ dependence curve for the contractile response of the atria was substantially shifted to the left by XQN (10 microM), and this XQN-induced shift was reversed by verapamil. The time-to-peak tension and relaxation times of the atrial contractions were shortened by XQN, and the action potential duration was markedly prolonged. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in left atrial strips confirmed that XQN (30 microM) increased the slow inward current. However, there was a temporal dissociation between altered tension development and prolongation of the action potential duration. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited and tissue cyclic AMP content of guinea pig left atria was increased by XQN (0.3-10 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner, but increases in cyclic AMP content did not occur in parallel with increases in contractile response. These observations suggest that an enhancement of intracellular cyclic AMP content and Ca++ influx across the cell membrane contribute to the late phase of XQN-caused cardiotonic responses, whereas the early phase may largely be elicited through direct activation of contractile elements. XQN may provide a novel leading compound for valuable cardiotonic agents.\r"

  ".W": "Xestoquinone (XQN), a novel cardiotonic principle from the sea sponge Xestospongia sapra, enhanced Ca+(+)-induced tension development of chemically skinned fibers from guinea pig cardiac muscle, even at both free Ca++ concentrations as low as -log molar free Ca++ (pCa) 9 to 8. In skinned fibers from guinea pig skeletal muscle, XQN (10 microM) also increased developed tension with a similar Ca++ dependence to that for cardiac fibers. In contrast to the unique Ca+(+)-dependence of XQN effects, the reference drug sulmazole enhanced Ca+(+)-induced tension development of skinned cardiac fibers at pCa 6.6 but did not affect it at pCa 8. In natural actomyosin from canine cardiac muscle, as well as in that from rabbit skeletal muscle, XQN (1-30 microM) enhanced the rate and extent of superprecipitation. Moreover, XQN produced a concentration-dependent increase in the myofibrillar ATPase activity of canine cardiac muscle, even at very low free Ca++ concentrations below the normal threshold for ATPase activation (pCa 9-8). The natural actomyosin ATPase activity of chicken smooth muscle was not influenced by XQN (up to 30 microM). In cardiac myofibrils, no significant difference was observed between the bound 45Ca+(+)-pCa relationship curves in the presence and absence of XQN (10 microM). Furthermore, XQN (30 microM) did not cause or potentiate Ca+(+)-induced Ca++ release from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. These observations suggest that XQN directly activates actomyosin ATPase activity of cardiac and skeletal myofibrils, thus producing an enhanced superprecipitation activity as well as an increase in skinned fiber contractility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In answer to the increasing number of trauma patients arriving at local hospitals, the ability of the adult Trauma Score (TS) to predict pediatric trauma outcome was tested. Of the total 2,604 pediatric trauma cases in the North Carolina State Trauma Registry, 441 had both a PTS and TS available for analysis. The primary measures of outcome were emergency department and hospital dispositions. Logistic regression demonstrated that TS (R2 = 0.50) was a stronger predictor of pediatric outcome and PTS (R2 = 0.35) for emergency department disposition and TS (R2 = 0.63) with PTS (R2 = 0.51) for hospital disposition. The correlation between TS and PTS was high (R = 0.8). Stepwise discriminant analysis demonstrated that TS was the stronger predictor of outcome and the PTS added only 9% (partial R2 = 0.09) more accuracy to TS for emergency department disposition and only 6% (partial R2 = 0.06) for hospital disposition. The results of this research demonstrate that TS is a useful method of predicting outcome in pediatric trauma. The use of both scores for each patient does not increase the predictive value of the scores.\r"

  ".W": "Recent data have suggested that patients with both a normal cranial CT scan and normal neurologic examination following minimal head injury (MHI) have no risk of neurologic deterioration. This study prospectively examined the safety of discharging patients from the emergency department (ED) after MHI whether or not there was a responsible observer at home. MHI was defined as a history of loss of consciousness (LOC), a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14 or 15, and no focal neurologic findings. In a 4-month period 111 patients with MHI were evaluated. Fifteen (14%) patients had a CT scan which revealed an intracerebral injury; 96 patients had a normal CT scan; five patients with normal CT scans were admitted because of persistent lethargy; and one patient was admitted after his CT that demonstrated an old infarct; the remaining 90 patients were discharged. There were 71 men and 19 women with a mean age of 29 years. The mechanism of injury was assault in 55, MVA in 30, and falls in five. The initial GCS in was 15 in 79 and 14 in 11. Fifty-eight per cent of patients were intoxicated. Fifty-seven (63%) patients were successfully contacted by telephone; none had developed any neurologic symptoms. Thirty-one patients who could not be followed up gave fictitious phone numbers. These data suggest that CT can reliably triage patients who can be discharged from the ED following MHI, even in the absence of a responsible observer. Hospital admission can be avoided in more than 80% of patients sustaining MHI, better utilizing scarce hospital resources.\r"

Our data failed to demonstrate that physician participation in flights had an impact on patient outcome. The groups were comparable in average distance traveled, initial Trauma Scores, number of organ systems injured, and the final Injury Severity Scores. Each group showed an improved survival over that predicted by comparison with the Multiple Trauma Outcome Study cohort. No difference was found in the number of procedures performed at the scene, en route, or on arrival at the hospital. Untreated injuries were slightly higher in the physician-present group. It appears that experienced nurses and paramedics, operating with well-established protocols, can provide aggressive care that yields equal outcome results compared with those of a flight team that includes a physician.\r"

All patients would have required an above-knee amputation for prosthesis fitting had microvascular free flaps not bee utilized. A total of 24 flaps were used in 22 patients; parascapular 11 (46%), foot filet six (25%), latissimus dorsi four (17%), lateral thigh, tensor fascia lata, and groin one (4%). Free flaps were performed immediately after injury in five (21%) cases, within the first week in two (8%), between 1 and 3 months in 12 (50%), and after 3 months in five (21%). Fifty per cent of the patients had significant other injuries. The patients had a total of 107 operations (mean, 4.9) related to their injury: 33 (mean, 1.5) of those operations were after the free flap, 27 (25%) of which were either performed because of a complication of the free flap or for revision of the free flap. Complications included partial necrosis in five (21%), neuroma in three (13%), hematoma in two (8%), donor site complication in two (8%), thrombosis requiring reoperation in one (4%), and flap failure in one (4%). Patient followup ranged from 12 to 116 months. All patients maintained a functional below-knee prosthetic level. The mean time to ambulation was 5.75 months, and was not significantly affected by flap complications. Most patients employed before their injury were employed after their injury. Despite a protracted course in these severe injured trauma patients, a functional below-knee amputation level was preserved in all cases utilizing microvascular free flaps.\r"

All patients with PET producing obvious or \"hard\" signs of vascular injury underwent immediate surgery. All asymptomatic proximity wounds were observed in hospital for 24 hours before discharge to outpatient followup. Patients with non-proximity wounds were discharged immediately. Patients with shotgun wounds and thoracic outlet injuries also underwent arteriography. Of 2,674 trauma patients evaluated during the 1-year study period, 310 (11.6%) had 366 penetrating extremity wounds, most (71%) occurring in the lower extremities. Gunshots caused most (82%) of the wounds, followed by stabs or lacerations (14.5%), and shotguns (3%). Clinically occult wounds in proximity to major limb vessels were the most common (78%) category of clinical presentation, followed by asymptomatic non-proximity wounds (16%), and wounds producing hard signs (6%). There were two missed vascular injuries, both in the asymptomatic proximity group (0.7% false negatives). Every patient taken immediately to surgery for hard signs had major arterial injury requiring repair, for a 100% positive predictive value for physical examination. No mortality or morbidity were related to protocol management. These results to date support prior reports of a negligible incidence of significant vascular injury following clinically occult proximity PET, and further suggest that the overall predictive value of physical examination of PET for vascular injury approaches 100%.\r"

This prospective study was designed to evaluate a precise definition of proximity, determine the incidence of positive arteriograms, and correlate angiographic interpretation with operative findings. Proximity was defined as any wound located within 1 cm of a major vessel. Excluded were patients with a pulse deficit, bruit, thrill, history of arterial hemorrhage, expanding hematoma, nerve deficit, fracture, or significant soft-tissue injury. One hundred sixty arteriograms were performed in 146 patients. One hundred forty-three (89.4%) were true-negatives. Seventeen (10.6%) were suggestive of injury. These included seven (4.4%) true-positive arteriograms, six (3.8%) false-positive studies, and four (2.5%) positive arteriograms in patients who were not operated upon. The angiographic report correlated with operative findings in five (38.5%) of 13 patients. These data confirm the low incidence (4.4%) of vascular injury in asymptomatic patients. The use of extremity angiography when proximity is the sole indication in an asymptomatic patient with a normal vascular examination must be questioned.\r"

  ".U": "91211162\r", 
  ".W": "We evaluated the ability of noninvasive vascular tests to exclude clinically significant occult arterial damage in injured extremities. In a preliminary study, a Doppler arterial pressure index (API) (the systolic AP in the injured extremity divided by the AP in an uninvolved arm) of less than 0.90 was found to have sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 97%, respectively, for major arterial injury. The negative predictive value for an API greater than 0.90 was 99%. Because these values suggested that noninvasive vascular tests might effectively be substituted for \"exclusion\" arteriography in patients at risk for silent extremity arterial injuries, we then conducted a trail in which arteriography was performed in extremity trauma victims only when the API was less than 0.90. Among 100 traumatized limbs (84 penetrating, 16 blunt) in 96 consecutive patients, 16 of 17 limbs (94%) with an API less than 0.90 had positive arteriographic findings, and seven underwent arterial reconstruction. Among 83 limbs with an API greater than 0.90, followup (including duplex scanning in 64 limbs) revealed five minor arterial lesions (four pseudoaneurysms, one arteriovenous fistula) but no major injuries. Arteriograms for extremity trauma fell from 14% to 5.2% of all angiographic studies performed (p less than 0.001, Chi-square). These studies suggest that noninvasive vascular tests can reliably exclude major occult arterial damage in injured extremities. Screening for such injuries with Doppler arterial pressure measurements, reserving arteriography for limbs in which the API is less than 0.90, is safe, accurate, and cost effective.\r"

The ability to improve the functional capacity of neutrophils could contribute to a reduced morbidity and mortality from sepsis following thermal injury. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that rhG-CSF increases the number of femoral marrow granulocyte progenitor cells and circulating neutrophils as well as the survival rate following burn wound infection. The studies reported here examine the effect of in-vivo administration of rhG-CSF on neutrophil chemotaxis following a burn injury and also following superimposed Pseudomonas burn wound sepsis in mice. Casein-elicited peritoneal neutrophils were harvested 72 hours after burn injury and 24 hours after infection. Chemotaxis was assessed using microchemotaxis chambers and 10(-5) M fMet-Phe as a chemoattractant. The number of neutrophils that migrated into the filter was used as an index of directed chemotaxis. Burn injury resulted in depressed chemotaxis compared with sham or sham/G-CSF-treated animals (p less than 0.05). Administration of rhG-CSF to burned animals resulted in a level of neutrophil chemotaxis comparable with that in control animals. The presence of a burn wound infection caused no further impairment of chemotaxis. Administration of rhG-CSF to animals with a burn wound infection resulted in improved chemotaxis compared with sham, burned, and burned/infected animals. The beneficial effect of G-CSF following burn wound infections from this and previous studies appears to be a combination of expanded numbers of myeloid elements and preservation of their function.\r"

Trauma patients admitted to the SICU were randomized to receive antacids (n = 27), continuous IV cimetidine (n = 32), or sucralfate (n = 30). Quantitative nasogastric tube (NGT) cultures were obtained biweekly and correlated with gastric pH, the incidence of pneumonia, and the incidence of pneumonia caused by an organism previously isolated from the stomach (percentage of gastric source of pneumonia--% GSP). Patients receiving antacids had a significantly greater pH than those receiving cimetidine (5.6 +/- 1.03 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.03; p = 0.006). However, there was no significant difference between the overall incidence of pneumonia, the percentage of NGT isolates greater than 10(6)/ml, or the % GSP. The gastric bacteriology of the three subgroups was nearly identical, with Candida albicans, Enterococci, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci being the most frequently isolated organisms. Gastric growth of organisms preceding their appearance in the blood occurred in 5 of 89 (5.6%) patients. These results suggest that 1) in trauma patients, the incidence of pneumonia is not increased by the use of stress ulcer prophylactic agents that elevate gastric pH; 2) increases in gastric pH progressively increased the number of intragastric bacteria but this did not correlate with an increased incidence of % GSP; and 3) while organisms in the upper intestinal tract may be pathogens for pneumonia, they are uncommonly a source of bacteremia in seriously injured patients.\r"

Eighteen anesthetized sheep were given a 40% of total body surface burn and fluid resuscitated to restore oxygen delivery (DO2) and filling pressures to baseline values. Animals were resuscitated with lactated Ringer's (LR) alone or LR plus 1,500 ml of a 5% hetastarch complexed with DFO (8 mg/ml). Animals were killed 6 hours postburn. The sheep resuscitated with LR and LR plus hetastarch demonstrated significant lung inflammation and significant increases in lung and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) from controls of 47 +/- 6 and 110 +/- 7 nMol/gm to 63 +/- 13 and 202 +/- 59 for LR and 67 +/- 4 and 211 +/- 9 for LR + hetastarch, respectively. The group resuscitated with hetastarch alone required 15% less fluid. VO2 returned to baseline values in both groups by 2 hours. Resuscitation with the 5% hetastarch-DFO decreased total fluids by 30% over LR and prevented the increase in lung and liver MDA. In addition, postburn VO2 increased by 25% above baseline values. Burn tissue edema, measured as protein-rich lymph flow, was significantly increased with the administration of DFO compared with the other groups. We conclude that DFO used for burn resuscitation prevents systemic lipid peroxidation and decreases the vascular leak in nonburn tissues while also increasing O2 utilization. Resuscitation with hetastarch-DFO may accentuate burn tissue edema, possibly by increased perfusion of burn tissue.\r"

  ".U": "91211166\r", 
  ".W": "Some measures of the efficacy of fluid resuscitation after hemorrhage are blood volume restitution (BVR) and attenuation of the neuroendocrine response. We compared the effectiveness of resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl and 3.0% NaCl in chronically prepared awake dogs after 30% hemorrhage. Each dog was bled on four occasions and resuscitated by four protocols: 1) full resuscitation (infusion to return and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at control +/- 10 mm Hg) with 3.0% NaCl (HS); 2) full resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl (NS); 3) under-resuscitation with a volume of 0.9% NaCl equal to the subject's previous 3.0% NaCl requirement (SV); and 4) no fluid therapy (NR). Approximately three times more volume was needed to restore MAP with NS vs. HS, and thus the amount of Na administered was not different in these groups. Net volume balance was positive in the NS and SV groups but negative in the HS group due to marked saline diuresis. Net Na balance was positive in all three fluid-treated groups, but significantly higher in the HS group (p less than 0.01). MAP remained below baseline in the SV and NR groups (p less than 0.05). BVR exceeded 100% in NS and HS early in resuscitation, but BVR was not sustained in the HS group. Total plasma protein increased in all three fluid treated groups. Responses of all hormones were completely attenuated in the NS group. ACTH, cortisol, and AVP responses were promptly attenuated in the HS group, but remained greater than control. In the SV group, all hormone levels except renin returned to control values, but more slowly than the other groups. ACTH and cortisol correlated best with BVR; AVP, PRA, and aldosterone correlated with MAP restoration. In summary, resuscitation with either HS or NS can achieve similar MAP restoration. Hypertonic saline produces a more rapid increase in BVR and MAP, but the BVR improvement is transient. Resuscitation with HS incurs an intracellular water debt which is aggravated by a saline diuresis. Hormonal attenuation is linked either to BVR (ACTH, cortisol) or to MAP restoration (renin, AVP). Thus the optimal resuscitation regimen may consist of initial infusion of hypertonic saline followed by sufficient hypotonic solution to restore interstitial fluid volume and normal cellular hydration.\r"

Proximity to major neck vessels without signs or symptoms of vascular trauma was the reason for angiography in ten of 26 patients with proven arterial injuries. Physical examination had a specificity of 80% and a sensitivity of 61% in this series. There was no correlation between mechanism or location of penetration and the likelihood of clinically significant injury. We conclude that recent recommendations suggesting that arteriography is unnecessary in asymptomatic patients with penetrating neck trauma are premature. Further investigations of larger patient samples are necessary to determine if \"proximity\" should be abandoned as an indication for arteriography. We advocate that, until additional data are accumulated, urgent arteriography and esophagography or operative exploration are indicated in stable asymptomatic patients with neck wounds which violate the platysma.\r"

The significantly improved (p less than 0.0001) scores of the post-course test demonstrate the value of a condensed trauma educational program. Analysis of the background variants (i.e., medical education, military, and residency training, and time since graduation) revealed that the relatively short but intensive course sufficed to surmount the difficulties inherent in instructing a student body composed of individuals with dissimilar professional experience. We advocate the institution of a compact course in trauma treatment, with the specific aim of enhancing the medical officer's knowledge in this critical field of medical care.\r"

We prospectively evaluated 60 consecutive trauma admissions to determine the impact of clearance of cervical spine radiographs on patient care. Fifty-three patients had no cervical spine injury (CSI). Intubations, emergency head CT scan, aortography, or urgent operation (less than 6 hours after admission) were required in the majority of patients and preceded complete cervical spine clearance in all but one instance. The median time for radiologic clearance of the cervical spine was 15 hours (range, 1.5 to 181). LCSR failed to identify three of the seven acute CSI (all three had C7 fractures). The spine-injured were managed with cervical collars and no new neurologic injury developed. We conclude that: 1) LCSRs do not appear to alter urgent management of multiply injured patients during resuscitation and transportation; 2) chest radiographs and emergency investigations should not be delayed by repeated LCSR in the trauma room as it may be difficult to fully exclude CSI in many trauma patients; 3) we support the current ATLS guidelines, which suggest that all patients should be presumed to have an unstable CSI until the presence of cervical injury has been excluded.\r"

Occasionally, these repairs fail due to adverse local factors, such as soft-tissue infection or enteric contamination. In these instances, limb salvage may require extra-anatomic arterial reconstruction. Between 1979 and 1989, 13 extra-anatomic bypasses were performed in ten male patients following nine failed primary repairs and one ligation of a traumatic arterial injury. The sites of arterial injury were: aorta (two), iliac (five), femoral (two), popliteal (one). Enteric contamination was present at initial operation in six patients; the remaining four had sustained massive soft-tissue injury. Reoperation was required for hemorrhage (seven), pseudoaneurysm (two), and arteriovenous fistula (one). All patients had developed local wound problems that militated against another anatomic repair. Extra-anatomic bypasses performed were: axillo-femoral (three), femoro-femoral (four), obturator (one), and two extra-anatomic femoral to popliteal saphenous vein grafts routed around an infected field. A second extra-anatomic reconstruction was performed for recurrent hemorrhage in three patients, (axillo-femoral--two, obturator--one). One patient with a neuropathic extremity and a functioning graft underwent amputation at 2 months following the initial injury. Two patients died of systemic sepsis. Seven patients (70%) have functional extremities with intact pulses at 2 to 24 months post bypass (mean, 7 months). Limb salvage after secondary disruption of secondarily infected arterial repairs can be achieved by appropriate extra-anatomic arterial reconstruction. In such cases, limb loss is due to soft-tissue sepsis or neuro-skeletal injuries and not vascular insufficiency.\r"

Such a discussion would focus on the mutual responsibility of all parties to create and maintain a universal private health care system.\r"

Reform would entail the following elements: a combination of incentives and requirements that would guarantee all workers (with their nonworking dependents) insurance coverage through their jobs; replacement of Medicaid with a new federal program that would cover all those not covered through the workplace and workers whose employers find public coverage more affordable; guaranteed affordable coverage for employers--through reform of private insurance, tax credits for small employers, and the opportunity to purchase public coverage; a minimum benefit standard for private and public plans that would cover preventive and primary services as well as catastrophic care and would include cost sharing, subject to ability to pay; and a combination of public and private sector initiatives to promote quality and contain costs.\r"

Under this proposed health care financing system, employees would provide basic health insurance coverage to workers and dependents, or pay a payroll tax contribution toward the cost of their coverage under Medicare. States would have the option of buying all Medicaid beneficiaries and other poor individuals into Medicare by paying the Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Other uninsured individuals would be automatically covered by Medicare. Employer plans would incorporate Medicare's provider payment methods. This proposal would result in incremental federal governmental outlays on the order of $25 billion annually. These new federal budgetary costs would be met through a combination of premiums, employer payroll tax, income tax, and general tax revenues. The principal advantage of this plan is that it draws on the strengths of the current system while simplifying the benefit and provider payment structure and instituting innovations to promote efficiency.\r"

Important correctable causes include cost-unconscious demand, a system not organized for quality and economy, market failure, and public funds not distributed equitably or effectively to motivate widespread coverage. We propose Public Sponsor agencies to offer subsidized coverage to those otherwise uninsured, mandated employer-provided health insurance, premium contributions from all employers and employees, a limit on tax-free employer contributions to employee health insurance, and \"managed competition\". Our proposed new government revenues equal proposed new outlays. We believe our proposal will work because efficient managed care does exist and can provide satisfactory care for a cost far below that of the traditional fee-for-service third-party payment system. Presented with an opportunity to make an economically responsible choice, people choose value for money; the dynamic created by these individual choices will give providers strong incentives to render high-quality, economical care. We believe that providers will respond to these incentives.\r"

  ".U": "91211202\r", 
  ".W": "In terms of the major objectives one would have for health system reform, this plan makes the following choices: 1. It would cover everyone, through Medicare (the elderly), employer-based coverage (some workers and dependents) or a state-level public program that would replace Medicaid (the poor, unemployed, and other workers and dependents). 2. There would be a standard minimum package of required benefits for employer-based and public programs, with legislative requirements on maximum cost-sharing. Choice of provider might be restricted in some states. 3. Administration of the private programs would be the responsibility, as now, of the employers and/or insurance companies. Administration of the public program would be the responsibility of the states, with the objective of maximizing responsiveness to local needs and conditions. 4. It would control costs through giving the states a substantial financial stake in ensuring that the public program costs did not grow faster than nominal GNP. State control would also allow the testing of different mechanisms for cost control, with the ultimate objective of identifying the most effective cost-containment strategies. 5. The cost would be borne by employers, employees, and taxpayers. Employers would be protected from exorbitant costs by being allowed the option of paying into a public plan rather than providing health insurance themselves. The poor and unemployed would be protected by having their coverage under the public program subsidized on a sliding scale. 6. The political feasibility test would be met by retaining a major role for insurance companies and by retaining the role of employer-based coverage--thus reducing the tax increase needed to ensure universal coverage. By allowing flexibility in design of cost-containment strategy, some of the controversy over this issue would also be deflected. Our proposal is also not without problems. First, our approach would still have adverse effects on the profitability of small businesses and on the employment prospects for low-wage workers--although these effects would be less than under conventional mandates and less than under proposals with higher tax rates. Second, some states may not want the responsibility we envision or have the capacity to carry it out. But several Canadian provinces are relatively small and are able to perform the same administrative functions within the Canadian national health system. In addition, since the federal government would continue to administer the Medicare program, states would have the option of tying their policies for hospital and physician payment and utilization control to those of Medicare.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The Heritage Foundation proposal calls for the elimination of the current tax exclusion and its replacement with a system of refundable tax credits for the purchase of health insurance and medical services.\r"

Such a national health program could reap tens of billions dollars in administrative savings in the initial years, enough to fund generous increases in health care services not only for the uninsured, but for the underinsured as well. We delineate a transitional national health program budget that would hold overall health spending at current levels while accommodating increases in hospital and physician utilization. Future national health program spending would be indexed to the growth in gross national product adjusted for demographic, epidemiologic, and technologic shifts. Financing for the national health program would transfer funds into the public program without disrupting the general pattern of current revenue sources. We suggest a funding package that would augment existing government health spending with earmarked health care taxes. Because these new taxes would replace employer-employee insurance premiums and substantial portions of current out-of-pocket expenditures, they would not increase health costs for the average American.\r"

It assigns important responsibilities to the federal government (eg, specification of benefits, review of proposed state health care budgets), while permitting states to select, develop, and administer specific program design features they deem appropriate (eg, states could build on and expand the existing health system infrastructure, including private insurance, and/or extend the role of tax-supported programs). It is estimated that in its first year the program would add about 5% to America's health expenditures, but within a few years, cost-containment efforts and administrative efficiencies would reduce overall expenditures below what they otherwise would be.\r"

When the patient is stable, MRI frequently contributes information to narrow the diagnostic possibilities, because vascular malformations and certain parenchymal lesions have a characteristic appearance on MRI. Hydrocephalus may also present acutely and is easily seen on CT or MRI. In a patient may show WMF and atrophy. The patient with trigeminal neuropathy may demonstrate central or peripheral lesions. In temporomandibular joint dysfunction, conventional tomography and MRI are frequently used. Magnetic resonance imaging shows excellent detail of the disk and surrounding soft tissues, whereas tomography better demonstrates bony changes. When a history of trauma is present, MRI may show a subacute subdural hematoma. These collections are easily seen on MRI, even when isodense on CT. Evidence of old shear injury is also well seen on MRI. Finally, neoplastic, inflammatory, congenital, and idiopathic sources of headache may be demonstrated by either MRI or CT, depending on presentation. MRI will generally show superior characterization.\r"

Ordinarily, the treatment is medical; however, if a response to drugs is not forthcoming, or if the patient becomes toxic while taking medications or refuses to abide by an appropriate medical program, then surgical consultation should be obtained and the appropriate operation performed. The form and type of neurosurgical procedure will probably depend to a considerable extent on the expertise of the neurosurgeon and his training. Generally, in the elderly, the simplest procedure should be attempted first. It may be necessary to employ both medical and surgical procedures in the individual patient. The medical drug of first choice is carbamazepine. Atypical facial neuralgia is a general term used to cover a variety of head and face pains that are poorly defined and that may not deserve separate clinical status. The pathogenesis of the atypical facial neuralgias is uncertain, and multiple causation seems likely. Search for local inflammatory pathology, neoplasms, vasomotor phenomena, and depressive symptoms is indicated. Treatment should be guided by the findings.\r"

Thrombosis of the cerebrovenous system is a less frequent cause of head pain than that of the arterial system, but it usually shows characteristic neurologic signs.

In general, most ocular causes for pain also cause the eye to be red, thus alerting the examiner to the focality of the problem. However, conditions like eyestrain, intermittent angleclosure glaucoma or neovascular glaucoma, and low-grade intraocular inflammation can be painful and not be associated with obvious redness. Ocular signs and symptoms also occur with numerous other causes of headache. Double vision in association with periocular pain can result from orbital lesions, isolated cranial neuropathies, and cavernous sinus lesions. Pupillary abnormalities like Horner's syndrome may result from a variety of painful conditions, including cluster headache, parasellar neoplasms or aneurysms, internal carotid dissection or occlusion, and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Pain with a dilated and unreactive pupil may reflect a benign condition like Adie's syndrome or ophthalmoplegic migraine, or it may herald the presence of a life-threatening posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Headache and transient visual loss can be manifestations of classic migraine, or be symptoms of ocular hypoperfusion from ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion or increased intracranial pressure from pseudotumor cerebri. In a young patient, head pain with a fixed visual deficit may result from optic neuritis, in an older adult, temporal arteritis may be the culprit. Ophthalmologic aspects of headache thus encompass problems that range from simple and benign to complex and formidable.\r"

Prescription as well as over-the-counter agents are often abused. Aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine are the most frequently abused compounds. Butalbital, ergot alkaloids, NSAIDS, and narcotic and oral or intranasal sympathomimetics are often abused. Patients with chronic daily headache complain of symptoms that may suggest a mixed-type headache. Features of migraine and muscle contraction headache often coexist in these individuals. It has been suggested that the most frequent cause for the transformation of a periodic headache into a daily headache is substance abuse. Substance abuse and drug dependency have multiple causes, and the etiology will reside with the compounds that are used to excess. The problem may arise as a result of poor instructions from the physician, improper diagnosis with gradual escalation in amounts of drug consumed, or a reinforcement mechanism and a brain stimulation-reward effect. The brain reward system has been studied with narcotics and psychomotor stimulants. It may be activated to a lesser degree with ergotamine, barbiturates, and other abused substances. The long-term effects of substance abuse are contingent on the compounds that are used. They may result in organ damage, medical complications, vascular injury, and a refractory state with chronic headache that eludes successful management of the headache disorder. Patients exhibit a less-than-satisfactory quality of life and are often depressed. Treatment includes outpatient care in cooperative, less dependent patients. Often patients will require inpatient management in order to discontinue use of the abused agents. Pharmacologic agents, behavior modification, psychotherapy, dietary intervention, and acupuncture may be necessary to treat the patient. Each patient must be treated by an interested physician, and the patient will require one or more of the preceding measures for a successful outcome. Often abused compounds must be discontinued in order to obtain a satisfactory response in an individual with chronic headache.\r"

  ".W": "We have discussed several miscellaneous headache disorders not associated with structural brain disease. The first group included those headaches provoked by \"exertional\" triggers in various forms. These include benign cough headache, BEH, and headache associated with sexual activity. The IHS diagnostic criteria were discussed. Benign exertional headache and cough headache were discussed together because of their substantial similarities. In general, BEH is characterized by severe, short-lived pain after coughing, sneezing, lifting a burden, sexual activity, or other similar brief effort. Structural disease of the brain or skull was the most important differential diagnosis for these disorders, with posterior fossa mass lesions being identified as the most common organic etiology. Magnetic resonance imaging with special attention to the posterior fossa and foramen magnum is the preferred method for evaluating these patients. Indomethacin is the treatment of choice. The headache associated with sexual activity is dull in the early phases of sexual excitement and becomes intense at orgasm. This headache is unpredictable in occurrence. Like BEH, the headache associated with sexual activity can be a manifestation of structural disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage must be excluded, by CT scanning and CSF examination, in patients with the sexual headache. Benign headache associated with sexual activity has been successfully treated with indomethacin and beta-blockers. The second miscellaneous group of headache disorders includes those provoked by eating something cold or food additives, and by environmental stimuli. Idiopathic stabbing headache does not have a known trigger and appears frequently in migraineurs. Its occurrence may also herald the termination of an attack of cluster headache. Indomethacin treatment provides significant relief. Three headaches triggered by substances that are eaten were reviewed: ingestion of a cold stimulus, nitrate/nitrite-induced headache, and MSG-induced headache. For the most part, avoidance of these stimuli can prevent the associated headache. Lastly, we reviewed headache provoked by high altitude and hypoxia. The headache is part of the syndrome of AMS during its early or benign stage and the later malignant stage of HACE. The pain can be exacerbated by exercise. The best treatment is prevention via slow ascent and avoidance of respiratory depressants. Acetazolamide and dexamethasone have proved useful in preventing this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cells are not just a semipermeable membrane that forms a barrier between the blood and the vascular smooth muscles. This cell system is a highly active metabolic endocrine organ. It not only produces a number of important substances in vascular and neural homeostasis but also inactivates vasoactive substances such as serotonin and bradykinin. In addition, it produces endothelin-1 and angiotensin II; more importantly in the context of migraine, endothelial cells produce the vasodilators prostacyclin and EDRF-NO, both of which are local (paracrine) hormones. The physiologic function of endothelial cells is affected by aspirin, which prevents prostacyclin formation but has little effect on normal blood pressure. From this information, one can infer that endothelial cell production of prostacyclin does not play an important part in normal cardiovascular control. On the other hand, the administration of Ng-monomethyl-L-arginine causes immediate increases in blood pressure. Because the administration of this substance inhibits the release of EDRF-NO, it appears that this paracrine endothelial hormone actively dilates the normal circulation. It is of cardinal importance that damage or flow perturbations of cell membranes of the endothelial lining of blood vessels cause an increased production of prostaglandins. However, smooth muscle cells underlying the endothelial lining also synthesize prostacyclin. This mechanism is thought to be held in reserve to reinforce local production of prostacyclin and vasodilatation when cell damage to the endothelial lining occurs and EDRF-No is not produced. Many theories for the causation of migraine have been proposed, and some have been reviewed. Those holding sway tend to ignore inconsistencies and cite supporting evidence in favor of their pet explanation only. I therefore have no hesitation to show that the best explanation at present, based on the most recent cellular evidence, explains all features of migraine and the response of migraineurs to therapy. The endothelial cell is the most likely site of the primary abnormality (Fig. 1). Although under physiologic circumstances perivascular innervation and endothelial systems closely interact in the control of vascular tone during pathologic conditions such as ischemia, the dominant role in protecting the circulation is endothelium-mediated. The biology of headache is so diverse and our ignorance sufficiently pervasive that the investigation of endothelial cell function may solve the mystery of migraine. To match the postulated crucial role of the endothelial cell in the pathogenesis of migraine, another cell would have to be ubiquitously present throughout the vasculature and not just confined to the central nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A new DNA technique for testing DR match between patient and unrelated marrow donors has been assessed. The technique is based on the formation of heteroduplexes between heterologous amplified coding and non-coding DNA sequences during the final annealing stage of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and different HLA-DR/Dw types give unique banding patterns (\"PCR fingerprints\") on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HLA-DR matching is by visual comparison of patients' with donors' fingerprints. Identity can be confirmed by mixing donor and recipient DNA before the final stage of the PCR (\"DNA crossmatching\"). In an assessment of the technique in 53 unrelated HLA-A and HLA-B matched patient-donor pairs, 42 pairs gave the same results with PCR fingerprinting as with DNA-RFLP analysis. In the 11 other pairs DR/Dw mismatches were detected by PCR fingerprinting but not by the standard DNA-RFLP method; PCR-SSO typing with selected sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSO) confirmed that mismatches were due to different subtypes of DR4. PCR fingerprinting might thus accelerate the selection of unrelated marrow donors by simplifying the logistics of the donor search.\r"

In an initial survey to identify HLS gene carriers, all patients treated at the University of Freiburg for angiomatosis retinae (22), haemangioblastoma of the central nervous system (CNS) (63), and phaeochromocytoma (54) were examined as potential HLS gene carriers. HLS was diagnosed in 86% of the patients with angiomatosis retinae, 19% of the patients with haemangioblastoma of the CNS, and 19% of the patients with phaeochromocytoma. Based on these and on an additional 49 newly diagnosed cases (24 by clinical examination and 25 by pedigree analysis), the calculated prevalence of the disease in the district of Freiburg, Germany, with a population of 1.909 million is 1/38 951. There was a striking tendency for familial clustering of HLS features in affected kindreds. Both angiomatosis retinae and haemangioblastoma of the CNS occurred in most families, whereas renal lesions and/or pancreatic cysts and phaeochromatocytoma were mutually exclusive. This finding suggests that HLS is caused by different mutations within a complex genetic locus, or additional genetic lesions, which cooperate with the HLS gene on chromosome 3p. The data point to a linear sequence of features as follows: phaeochromocytoma, angiomatosis retinae, haemangioblastoma of the CNS, renal lesions, pancreatic cysts, and epididymal cystadenoma.\r"

The THPP group had significantly higher fasting insulin concentrations (27.6 [3.6] vs 13.4 [1.8] mU/l; p less than 0.005) and a higher overall insulin response to oral glucose (p less than 0.001 by ANOVA) than the thyrotoxicosis group. There were no significant differences in fasting or stimulated glucose. Hyperinsulinaemia may be an important factor in the precipitation of acute paralysis in THPP.\r"

Another patient with EMS associated with L-tryptophan in 1988 was followed up for 30 months. 93% of the 28 survivors from the 1989 cohort continue to have symptoms affecting 1-4 organ systems (median 3) and 3 have died, so the disorder produces considerable morbidity and mortality. The chronic sequelae most often associated with long-term disability are sclerodermatous skin thickening (54%), sensorimotor polyneuropathy (61%), proximal myopathy (36%), and severe episodic myalgias (64%). Thrombocytopenia developed in 1 patient. HLA-class II typing revealed a non-significant trend towards an association with HLA-DR4. Early therapy with corticosteroids did not seem to prevent the development of chronic manifestations.\r"

  ".W": "234 patients with menorrhagia were treated hysteroscopically by transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) instead of hysterectomy. 250 procedures were performed under general anaesthesia (63%) or under sedation plus local anaesthesia (38%). The endometrium was excised either totally (91%) or partially (9%) in all but one case, and 56 (22%) of the patients underwent simultaneous resection of submucous fibroids. Surgical time (range 10-100 min) varied with the gynaecologist's experience. 479 ml was the average volume of uterine irrigant absorbed by the patient. Blood loss was usually slight. Operative complications were uncommon, but 4 (2%) women sustained a uterine perforation (without serious sequelae), 7 (3%) absorbed more than 2 litres of fluid, and 1 required tamponade to control postoperative bleeding. Hospital stay was short and full recovery usual by 1-2 weeks. Menstrual symptoms improved in over 90% of the patients throughout the follow-up of up to 2 1/2 years; 27-42% of the women became amenorrhoeic at some time after total TCRE. Results were best in women greater than 35 years of age, but was not influenced by the presence of fibroids or pretreatment dysmenorrhoea. 10 (4%) women later underwent hysterectomy. Hysteroscopy 3 and 12 months after surgery revealed a small, fibrotic uterine cavity in the majority.\r"

Criteria for entry to the study attempted to ensure that no patient was a chronic hepatitis B carrier. Patients were randomised either to a moderate alcohol intake, or to continued complete abstention. Drinkers consumed 26 g alcohol daily (mean) and none remained abstinent. At 3 months all patients were well, with normal liver function tests. There were no significant differences between the two groups at anytime. The findings suggest that moderate alcohol intake during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis does not seem to be harmful.\r"

Employing this model, it was possible to produce a 108 g difference in carcass fat content between two groups of rats simply by selecting the seven fattest and the seven leanest animals from a group of 100. The results of this study provide evidence that the gastrointestinal tract was not a site of caloric wastage, that total energy excreted in feces and urine was directly proportional to caloric intake, that differences in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis were not responsible for the twofold difference in adiposity between the lean and fat rats, and that a family of hepatic lipogenic enzymes was not up-regulated even though the habitual consumption of a diet rich in carbohydrate was greater in the fat vs lean rats. The fat rats also had a greater lean body mass. Therefore, the additional calories consumed by the fat rats could have contributed to their greater adiposity and/or could have been channeled to sustain more active tissue. Finally, evidence was presented to show that the experimental selection process is an important consideration when determining the relationship between caloric intake and body fat content.\r"

The purpose of this paper was to examine how perturbation of these dietary factors that control energy balance affects adiposity. There is a substantial amount of evidence suggesting that obesity is not associated with overeating, but with a high dietary fat-to-carbohydrate intake ratio. Physiological adaptations to energy-reduced dieting facilitate both weight regain and make it more difficult to lose weight during subsequent dieting attempts. Since obesity may be better characterized by diet composition than by energy intake, successful weight-loss programs should include diet compositional changes in their regimes.\r"

  ".W": "Overweight and obesity are not homogeneous phenotypes as individuals differ in terms of the regional distribution of the excess weight or fat. Overweight and obesity are also complex multifactorial phenotypes influenced by both genetic and nongenetic determinants. Heritability of fat mass or percent body fat derived from underwater weighing measurement reaches about 25% of the age and gender adjusted phenotypic variance. Based on twin and parent-child data, it has been reported that the heritability of resting metabolic rate, thermic response to food, and energy cost of submaximal exercise, adjusted for the proper concomitants, is as high as 40%. The level of habitual physical activity also exhibits a significant heritability level on the order of about 25%. Experimental overfeeding with identical twins demonstrates that there are inherited differences in body weight and body composition response. The most important factor identified thus far to account for the individual differences in response to long-term overfeeding is a nutrient partitioning characteristic, namely the proportion of fat vs lean tissue gained. The high gainers are those storing energy primarily in the form of fat, while the low gainers are storing relatively more in the form of lean tissue.\r"

An emphasis on exercise and prescribing more gradual changes in diet and exercise appears to be associated with better outcomes. There may be a need to conceptualize obesity as a food dependency disorder not amenable to self-control strategies. External social control through peer support groups may be indicated to help patients through temptations.\r"

Swimming and baseball both create stresses to the humerus which may result in injuries to the shoulder and upper extremity. Stress fractures (fatigue fractures) are usually limited to the lower extremity (i.e., tibia or metatarsal). Upper extremity stress fractures, especially of the humerus, are very uncommon. Precipitating factors include repetitive stresses, low grade external forces, rapid application of muscular force to the bone, or an underlying disease or pathologic weakness of the bone. The majority of these fractures are primarily due to abnormal and repetitive stresses to bones. This case study examines the mechanism of injury, clinical presentation, and treatment of a clinically apparent stress fracture which ultimately converted to an overt humerus fracture in a 14-yr-old cross-trained athlete.\r"

Eight male cyclists completed three rides during which they ingested either 11.5 (LV), 17.1 (MV), or 23 ml.kg-1.h-1 (HV) of a 7.5% CHO solution every 15 min. Blood samples were taken at 0, 60, 90, and 120 min and 15 min after the ride for the determination of PVC, sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and BG. Body weight was recorded before and after the rides to determine dehydration. Rates of GE were determined via stomach aspiration after the rides. A significantly (P less than 0.05) greater volume of fluid was emptied in the HV trial (2268 +/- 70.8 ml) compared with the MV and LV trials (1860 +/- 72 and 1452 +/- 24 ml, respectively). The rate of GE in the MV trial was also significantly greater than in the LV trial. RF were significantly higher in the MV and HV trials compared with the LV trial throughout the rides. There were no significant differences in PVC (0.01 +/- 2.2%, 1.05 +/- 1.62%, and 0.97 +/- 1.28% for LV, MV, and HV, respectively), Na+, K+, or BG between the three trials. There was a significantly greater decrease in body weight in the LV (-0.77 +/- 0.14 kg) compared with the MV and HV trials (-0.38 +/- 0.13 and -0.14 +/- 0.14 kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare gastric emptying (GE) responses during intense, prolonged cycling and running. It is important to discern whether gastric emptying (GE) responses are exercise-mode specific, since the findings of cycling and running studies are often compared and applied to one another. Ten male biathletes cycled (CY) and ran (R) for 1 h at 75% of their mode-specific VO2max or rested (S) and consumed water (SW, CYW, RW) or a 7% carbohydrate solution (SC, CYC, RC) at a rate of 10 ml.kg-1.h-1 (approximately 180 ml at 0, 15, 30, and 45 min). No differences were found between CYW, CYC, RW, RC, and SC for volume of drink emptied (mean +/- SE) (522.8 +/- 47.9 ml) and GE rate (range, 8.2 +/- 0.9 (RC) to 9.3 +/- 0.6 ml.min-1 (SC]. A mean of 72.7 +/- 5.7% of the total consumed volume was emptied. The GE rate during SW was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than the other conditions (11.3 +/- 0.4 ml.min-1, 94.0 +/- 1.9% of total consumed volume emptied). Substantial volumes of water and a 7% carbohydrate solution are thus emptied from the stomach during prolonged, intense running and cycling, with no differences in GE between these exercise modes. These data suggest that recommendations concerning GE are reciprocal between running and cycling bouts similar to those in the current study.\r"

L-[1-13C]leucine was used as a tracer to calculate leucine oxidation and whole body protein synthesis in six healthy, fed, male athletes in response to a 1 h bout of circuit-set resistance exercise. The measurements were performed prior to, during, and for 2 h after exercise, and corrections were made for background 13CO2/12CO2 breath enrichment and bicarbonate retention factor changes. Results demonstrated significant (P less than 0.01) increases in the background 13CO2/12CO2 breath enrichment at 1 and 2h after exercise and in the bicarbonate retention factor (P less than 0.01) during exercise. At 15 min after exercise, the bicarbonate retention factor was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than at rest. There were no significant effects of exercise on leucine oxidation or flux, whole body protein synthesis, or the rate of appearance of endogenous leucine. We concluded that circuit-set resistance exercise did not affect the measured variables of leucine metabolism. In addition, large errors in calculating leucine oxidation and whole body protein synthesis during resistance exercise can occur if background 13CO2/12CO2 breath enrichment and bicarbonate retention factor changes are not accounted for.\r"

In a double-blind study conducted on two different days, 20 mg of the opioid-antagonist naloxone or placebo was administered prior to exercise. A significant pain threshold elevation was found during exercise for finger (ANOVA, P less than 0.004) and dental pulp stimulation (P less than 0.01). Pain threshold elevation was most pronounced during maximal exertion, at which time the subjects reported the greatest subjective fatigue. Thresholds remained elevated 10-15 min after the end of exercise, and, 60 min after exercise, thresholds returned to baseline values. The subjective magnitude estimation of suprathreshold stimuli was significantly reduced (P less than 0.0001) 5-10 min after exercise. Plasma beta-endorphin, cortisol, and catecholamines increased significantly (P less than 0.0005, all values) during exercise. Plasma beta-endorphin levels did not correlate significantly with pain thresholds (r = -0.37, NS). Naloxone failed to affect pain thresholds, although beta-endorphin and cortisol increased significantly more (P less than 0.02) during exercise after naloxone. It is concluded that short-term, exhaustive physical exercise can evoke a transient elevation in pain thresholds. This exercise-induced elevation in pain threshold does not, however, appear to be directly related to plasma endorphin levels.\r"

Pennsylvania, which differed markedly in their socioeconomic status (SES), in order to evaluate the relationship of SES to physical activity patterns. A total of 917 individuals participated in a prevalence survey administered during a home visit in 1981. All of the participants were white. Households were randomly selected. An overall response rate of 84% was achieved. Activity was assessed using the Paffenbarger survey, which included the number of blocks walked, stairs climbed, sports and recreational activities, and hours spent in vigorous, moderate, and light activities. In both high and low SES individuals, activity was inversely associated with age and was higher in males than in females. The relationship of physical activity to SES differed depending on the dimension of activity assessed. Participation in sports was reported more frequently in high status males and females. SES was a significant predictor of walking activity in females, with low status females reporting more walking. The number of hours spent in moderate activities was greater, but the number of hours spent in light activities was lower, in low status males. There was little difference by SES in the composite activity score, average annual kilocalories per week. In summary, our research suggests that SES can impinge differently on separate manifestations of activity, and future research needs to identify how SES affects activity.\r"

On two occasions, seven trained males cycled for 180 min on a Monark cycle ergometer at 70% peak VO2 (VO2peak). Subjects consumed an 8% glucose/electrolyte drink (G) or a flavored water placebo (P) every 15 min throughout exercise. Measurement of RPE, ventilation (VE), oxygen uptake (VO2), respiration rate (RR), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate (HR), and venous blood sample collection preceded ingestion of the drink. Subjects were homogenous with respect to height, weight, and VO2peak. RPE for the legs and overall body were significantly attenuated (P less than 0.05) during the last 45 min of exercise. Plasma glucose and insulin were higher (P less than 0.05) in G than in P at virtually all time points. CHO oxidation and work rate were maintained throughout exercise in G but not during the last 30 min of exercise in P (P less than 0.05). Percent changes in plasma volume, plasma lactate, HR, VE, RR, and RPE for the chest were not different between conditions (P greater than 0.05). The data suggest that ingestion of carbohydrate beverages during endurance cycling can maintain plasma glucose and CHO oxidation during the latter stages of prolonged exercise. As a result, it appears that a relationship exists between attenuation of ratings of perceived exertion (especially in the legs), blood glucose, and CHO oxidation late in prolonged exercise. The mechanism for this probably involves the increased availability of blood-borne glucose to serve as substrate for brain and/or muscle energy metabolism during a time when endogenous stores of carbohydrate are low.\r"

Force and cinematographic data were collected during each lift. The augmentation to performance derived from prior stretch was observed to decay as a function of the pause duration. This relationship was accurately described (P less than 0.01) by a negative exponential equation with a half-life of 0.85 s. The nature of this decay is discussed with reference to the implications for stretch-shorten cycle movements that are performed with a period of pause between the eccentric and concentric phases and for stretch-shorten cycle research paradigms.\r"

For the first 4 wk of this study, the two groups trained together in one session per day for approximately 1.5 h.d-1. During the following 6 wk (weeks 5-11), one group (LONG) trained two sessions per day, 1.5 h in the morning and 1.5 h in the afternoon. The other group (SHORT) continued to train once each day, in the afternoon with the LONG group. Over the final 14 wk of the study, both groups trained together in one session per day (1.5 h.d-1). Although the swimmers experienced significant improvements in swimming power, endurance, and performance throughout the 25 wk study, there were no differences between the groups. However, during the 6 wk period of increased training, the LONG group experienced a decline in sprinting velocity, whereas the SHORT group showed a significant increase in sprinting performance. The test results suggest that a 6 wk period of two 1.5 h training sessions per day does not enhance performance above that experienced with a single training session of 1.5 h each day. It was also noted that both groups showed little change in swimming endurance and power after the first 8 wk of training, though their performances improved significantly after each taper period.\r"

Following 30-60 min of treadmill accommodation, stride-to-stride and day-to-day biomechanical stability were assessed in 31 male runners (studies 1 and 2) who performed two level treadmill runs (3.33 m.s-1) at the same time of day, in the same footwear, and in a nonfatigued state. Under the same testing conditions, daily stability in RE was determined in 17 of the 31 subjects (study 2). RE demonstrated high day-to-day reliability (r = 0.95), and the mean coefficient of variation in RE was 1.32% (range = 0.30-4.40%). Stride-to-stride reliability for temporal (T), kinematic (KNM), and kinetic (KIN) measures was very high (mean r = 0.96; range = 0.91-0.99), but day-to-day reliability was lower for KIN (mean r = 0.67; range = 0.28-0.88) compared with T and KNM (mean r = 0.91; range = 0.68-0.98). Further analyses revealed no significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) mean stride-to-stride differences for any biomechanical variable, and only three of 22 variables (peak resultant velocity of the ankle joint, step length, and swing time) demonstrated statistically significant day-to-day differences. Viewed in concert, these results suggest that, if the testing environment is controlled, multiple trials are not required to obtain stable measures of running economy and basic mechanical characteristics in trained male runners if group data from adequate sample sizes are considered. However, if individual records are scrutinized or if small sample sizes cannot be avoided, at least two measures of individual performances should be secured.\r"

The subjects were eight AB, eight paraplegic (PARA), and eight quadriplegic (QUAD) males, ranging in age from 18 to 51 yr. There was a 0.99 correlation (P less than 0.001) between RVA and RVW for AB subjects but no significant correlations between RVA and RVW for the PARA or QUAD groups. RVA in the QUAD group was significantly higher than in the PARA or AB group (P less than 0.003). There were no differences in RVW among the three groups. In the QUAD group, RVA was significantly larger than RVW (P less than 0.001), but there were no significant differences between RVA and RVW for the PARA or AB subjects. Db and %BF did not differ significantly among the PARA or AB groups when calculated at RVA and RVW. However, for QUAD, both Db and %BF differed significantly (P less than 0.001) when calculated at RVA and RVW. It was concluded that, for the purpose of hydrostatic weighing, residual lung volume of quadriplegic persons should be measured with the subject immersed in water.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurologic disorder that commonly results in paralysis and death. Despite more than a century of research, no cause of, cure for, or means of preventing this disorder has been found. In a minority of cases, it is familial and inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with age-dependent penetrance. In contrast to the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the familial form provides the opportunity to use molecular genetic techniques to localize an inherited defect. Furthermore, such studies have the potential to discover the basic molecular defect causing motor-neuron degeneration. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated 23 families with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for linkage of the gene causing this disease to four DNA markers on the long arm of chromosome 21. Multipoint linkage analyses demonstrated linkage between the gene and these markers. The maximum lod score--5.03--was obtained 10 centimorgans distal (telomeric) to the DNA marker D21S58. There was a significant probability (P less than 0.0001) of genetic-locus heterogeneity in the families. CONCLUSIONS. The localization of a gene causing familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis provides a means of isolating this gene and studying its function. Insight gained from understanding the function of this gene may be applicable to the design of rational therapy for both the familial and sporadic forms of the disease.\r"

  ".U": "91211685\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia have a characteristic (15;17) translocation, with a breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the region of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha). Since this receptor has been shown to be involved with growth and differentiation of myeloid cells in vitro, and since recent clinical studies have reported that tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia we studied the effects of tretinoin on cellular maturation and molecular abnormalities in patients undergoing the induction of remission with this agent. RESULTS. Eleven patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with tretinoin administered orally at a dose of 45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day. Nine of the 11 patients entered complete remission. In two patients, complete remission was preceded by striking leukocytosis that then resolved despite continued drug treatment. Serial studies of cellular morphologic features, cell-surface immunophenotypic analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome 17 probe revealed that clinical response was associated with maturation of the leukemic clone. All patients who responded to treatment who were tested by Northern blot analysis had expression of aberrant RAR-alpha. As patients entered complete remission, the expression of the abnormal RAR-alpha message decreased markedly; however, it was still detectable in several patients after complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission had been achieved. CONCLUSIONS. Tretinoin is a safe and highly effective agent for inducing complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Clinical response to this agent is associated with leukemic-cell differentiation and is linked to the expression of an aberrant RAR-alpha nuclear receptor. Molecular detection of the aberrant receptor may serve as a useful marker for residual leukemia in patients with this disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Ethylene oxide is a sterilant gas that causes leukemia and other cancers in animals. Studies in Sweden have shown an excess of leukemia and stomach cancer in humans exposed to ethylene oxide, but other studies have generally failed to confirm these findings. METHODS. We conducted a study of mortality in 18,254 U.S. workers exposed to ethylene oxide at 14 plants producing sterilized medical supplies and spices. The subjects averaged 4.9 years of exposure to the gas and 16 years of follow-up. The exposure levels in recent years averaged 4.3 ppm (eight-hour time-weighted adjusted exposure) for sterilizer operators and 2.0 ppm for other workers. The levels in earlier years are likely to have been several times higher. Mortality in this cohort was compared with that in the general U.S. population. RESULTS. Overall there was no significant increase in mortality from any cause in the study cohort. The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were 0.97 for leukemia (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.67; 13 deaths observed), 1.06 for all hematopoietic cancers (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.47; 36 deaths), and 0.94 for stomach cancer (95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.70; 11 deaths). Analyses according to job category and according to the duration of exposure showed no excess in cancers, as compared with the rate in the general population, but there was a significant trend toward increased mortality with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure for all hematopoietic cancers. The rate of death from hematopoietic cancer (especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 1.55; 27 deaths). Mortality from leukemia in recent years (1985 through 1987) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 3.45; 5 deaths). CONCLUSIONS. For the entire cohort, there was no increase in mortality from hematopoietic cancer. There was a slight but significant increase among men, however. Among men and women combined, there was a trend toward an increased risk of death from hematopoietic cancer with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure to ethylene oxide.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: Variegate porphyria is a genetic disorder of porphyrin metabolism in which patients may have both neurologic dysfunction and photocutaneous lesions. Biochemical confirmation of the diagnosis can be difficult, particularly in patients without neurologic dysfunction at the time of testing. The demonstration of increased fecal excretion of porphyrin is frequently used for this purpose, but levels may be normal. Since elevated fecal porphyrin levels in variegate porphyria are presumably a consequence of increased biliary excretion, we evaluated whether analysis of porphyrins in bile distinguishes better between patients with variegate porphyria and controls. METHODS: Bile samples were collected by duodenal aspiration from 10 patients with proved variegate porphyria who had no neurologic symptoms when they were studied and 17 control subjects. Bile and fecal porphyrin levels were measured fluorometrically. RESULTS: The mean total porphyrin concentration in bile in the patients with variegate porphyria was significantly higher than that in the controls (67.8 vs. 0.71 mumol per liter; P less than 0.00002). There was more than a ninefold difference between the highest level in any control subject and the lowest level in any patient with variegate porphyria. The mean fecal porphyrin level in the patients with variegate porphyria also differed significantly from that in the controls (0.79 vs. 0.14 mumol per gram of dry weight; P less than 0.007), but four patients had levels within the control range. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of porphyrin in bile is higher in patients with variegate porphyria than in controls, and the difference is greater than that for fecal porphyrin. Bile porphyrin measurements may be helpful in the evaluation of asymptomatic patients suspected of having variegate porphyria.\r"

This longitudinal, observational, population-based study used data from the Maryland Human Immunodeficiency Virus Information System, a data base that links information from the Maryland AIDS Registry with data on public and private health care claims, vital statistics, and hospital, long-term care, and ambulatory care records. RESULTS: The median survival after diagnosis among persons with AIDS (n = 1028) was 140 days longer for those given their diagnoses between 1987 and 1989 than for those given their diagnoses between 1983 and 1985 (450 vs 310 days). Among the 714 persons in whom AIDS was diagnosed after April 1987 (when zidovudine became available), two-year survival was greater among men than women (P less than 0.03), among persons less than 45 years old than among older persons (P less than 0.001), among non-Hispanic whites than among minorities (P less than 0.001), and among persons whose category of human immunodeficiency virus transmission was homosexual contact than among those with heterosexual, transfusion-related, or less common modes of transmission (P less than 0.02). In all the analyses the groups with the longer survival were more likely to have received zidovudine. The median survival among those who received zidovudine was 770 days, as compared with 190 days among those who never received the drug (P less than 0.001). By proportional-hazards analysis, zidovudine therapy was the factor most strongly associated with improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: For Maryland residents with AIDS there has been an improvement in survival since 1987. Zidovudine therapy and perhaps other aspects of care associated with it have contributed substantially to the improved survival.\r"

  ".W": "The crush syndrome consists of the general manifestations that follow prolonged continuous pressure on the limbs. These manifestations are caused by the disintegration of muscle tissue and leakage of the contents of myocytes into the plasma. The morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome are high. The pathophysiologic process of the derangements associated with the crush syndrome is not fully understood, but the injury induced by reperfusion is likely to be important in its development. The injury due to reperfusion involves many factors, but it is currently ascribed largely to the release of oxygen free radicals, massive accumulation of calcium in ischemic muscles, and the infiltration of neutrophils into reperfused vessels. Since ischemic muscles cannot survive without reperfusion, a strategy to salvage as much of the muscle and kidney tissue as possible in the crush syndrome must include ways of decreasing injury during ischemia and reperfusion. Various pharmacologic agents may attenuate or prevent reperfusion-induced injury to ischemic skeletal muscles and consequently to other organs, particularly the kidneys.\r"

After the beginning of ECC, arterial perfusion pressure and haematocrit values decreased suddenly, while IOP raised immediately. Sudden increase of blood volume in the beginning of ECC can be the probable cause of IOP elevation. Afterwards, IOP levels decreased to pre-ECC levels. We think that the drop is due to the effect of mannitol in the priming solution and hyposecretion of aqueous humour due to insufficient nutrition-oxygenation of corpus ciliaris after haemodynamic stabilization.\r"

The data demonstrate important intercenter variation of current neonatal outcomes, as well as differences in philosophy of care and definition and prevalence of morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Although several outbreaks of group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GGBHS) pharyngitis have been described, doubt still remains regarding the etiologic role of GGBHS in acute pharyngitis beyond a limited number of situations. In the winter/spring of 1986/87, throat cultures were obtained from 222 consecutive children seen at a private pediatric office with acute pharyngitis and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were recovered from 91 children (41%) and GGBHS from 56 children (25%). One patient had both GABHS and GGBHS isolated. This isolation rate of GGBHS was dramatically greater than in previous and subsequent years, and 67% of the GGBHS isolates occurred during an 8-week period. Results of DNA fingerprinting of the 57 isolates of GGBHS demonstrated that 43 (75%) appeared to be the same strain. The patients with GGBHS were comparable to those with GABHS with respect to clinical findings, antistreptolysin-O titer response, and clinical response to antibiotic therapy. However, patients with GGBHS were significantly older (P less than .05). This is the first well-documented, community-wide outbreak of GGBHS pharyngitis and the first respiratory outbreak of GGBHS pharyngitis in a pediatric population. GGBHS may be a more important cause of acute, treatable pharyngitis than had been previously recognized.\r"

The vaccine was generally well tolerated. Ninety-six percent (2381/2475) of vaccinees responded to vaccination by producing antibody as measured by a glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; 99% (569/576) of those tested maintained antibody at 1 year following vaccination. The incidence of varicella following household exposure in vaccinees was approximately 12%; household contact historically results in 87% infection. Nearly all of the vaccinees who had varicella after vaccination had a clinically modified disease.\r"

  ".W": "In April 1987, a census of children dependent on medical technology was carried out in Massachusetts to determine the one-month point prevalence. All medical and educational providers in the state who were likely to interact with such children were contacted and asked to complete a two-sided data form on youngsters (aged 3 months to 18 years) with tracheostomies, supplementary oxygen, respirators, suctioning, gastric feeding, central venous lines, ostomies, ureteral diversion, urethral catheterization and dialysis. Nearly 1250 children were found meeting these criteria. Capture-recapture analysis set the lower bound for technology dependence at 0.08% of the state's children. An analysis of the organ systems involved showed that 57% of the children had neurologic involvement--13% multisystem, 7% gastrointestinal-metabolic, 4% renal-genitourinary, and 3% musculoskeletal. Less than 1% of the children were reported as having immunologic or \"other\" disorders. Review of putative etiologies indicated that 45% of the children had congenital anomalies, 33% chronic medical diseases, 9% perinatal conditions, 7% hereditary-genetic disorders, 5% injuries, 2% infections, and 3% \"other.\" The substantial prevalence of technology dependency among children creates challenges at the social, economic, and policy-making levels. It will be important to carry out systematic reporting and monitoring activities throughout time and across sites. This census is an example of one such statewide effort.\r"

In the United States, most infants with acute diarrhea are treated as outpatients. In the present study, infants with diarrhea who were treated as outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either a soy-based, lactose-free formula alternating with oral rehydration solution from the beginning of therapy (\"early feeding\") or oral rehydration solution alone for the first 24 hours of therapy, followed by a soy-based, lactose-free formula alternating with oral rehydration solution (control group). Twenty-nine infants were randomly assigned to the early-feeding group and 27 to the control group. Twenty-one (72%) of 29 in the early-feeding group resolved their diarrhea at the end of 48 hours of therapy compared with 12 (44%) of 27 in the group fed oral rehydration solution only (P = .02). It is concluded that the introduction of a soy-based, lactose-free formula from the beginning of therapy for acute diarrhea in children treated as outpatients is safe and may shorten duration of diarrhea while maintaining adequate caloric intake.\r"

To determine whether the recommendation to increase carrying would be effective as a therapy for colic, 66 mothers of infants 4 weeks of age or less who came to their pediatricians with complaints of crying problems (\"colic\") were randomized to receive standard pediatric advice (standard group) or standard advice plus the recommendation to increase supplemental carrying by 50% (supplemental group). Overall, the supplemental group carried their infants 6.1 hours/d throughout the intervention period, an increase of 2.2 hours/d (56%) more than that provided by the standard group. Despite this significant increase in carrying, there was no difference between groups in the duration or frequency of crying, fussing, or cry/fuss at any time throughout the intervention period. When the greatest treatment effect was expected at 6 weeks, the supplemental group infants cried only 3 minutes less per day (95% confidence interval: 37 minutes less to 32 minutes more per day). We conclude that, compared with standard pediatric advice to be \"responsive,\" supplemental carrying does not reduce crying and fussing behavior further in infants who have colic. In marked contrast to healthy infants, this apparent resistance to increased carrying may indicate an important difference in state regulation and control in infants with colic.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated serum sodium and potassium levels were recently observed when sampled through a heparin-bonded umbilical catheter and measured with certain ion-selective electrodes. The cationic surfactant, benzalkonium chloride (BZC), is known to falsely elevate those cations in serum. Inasmuch as most heparin-bonded umbilical catheters use BZC during the bonding process, an in vitro study was performed to estimate the quantity of BZC released and the duration of sodium and potassium elevations during pooled sera infusion. Three heparin-bonded umbilical catheters and 3 silastic umbilical catheters were first flushed with 0.3 mL of normal saline and then perfused with pooled sera (sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 4.6 mEq/L) at 2.5 microL/h. Effluent samples were collected from 0 to 8 hours and analyzed by ion-selective electrodes. Elevated serum sodium concentrations from 160 to greater than or equal to 250 mEq/L and potassium concentrations from 6.0 to greater than or equal to 9.6 mEq/L were observed. The BZC concentration in the catheter effluent was measured by mass spectrometry, with peak values of 10 micrograms/mL detected by this method. When varying concentrations of BZC (1 to 100 micrograms/mL) were added directly to pooled serum, a dose-dependent increase in serum sodium was observed. These data demonstrate that BZC released from heparin-bonded umbilical catheters elevates serum electrolyte values measured with some ion-selective electrodes. The observed increase in sodium and potassium concentrations may lead to clinical errors in management. Benzalkonium chloride is associated with myriad of linical symptomatology. Whether this amount of BZC is toxic in the small premature neonate is presently unknown.\r"

More than three fourths (77%) of the surveys mailed were completed. Respondents indicated the following: (1) a majority (92%) of police personnel were trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and basic first aid, (2) only half (57%) of police were trained in moving or transporting patients, and (3) few (36%) police were provided ongoing training in emergency pediatric medical skills. In spite of this, police were reportedly present at calls activating emergency medical services systems between 24% and 69% of the time, and the majority of these were trauma related. Police chiefs surveyed indicated that their officers played a large role in medical management prior to arrival of emergency medical services personnel; 87% would initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 93% would begin basic first aid. Sixty-one percent of police chiefs indicated that officers would occasionally \"scoop and run\" with a critically ill child rather than await emergency medical services arrival. The data indicate that, right or wrong, police personnel are actively involved in their prehospital care system at present. In many instances, their help may be needed. Further thought should be given toward defining an exact emergency medical services role for police personnel and toward providing adequate initial and ongoing basic medical training for these individuals.\r"

Days of hospitalization and cost for 318 admissions and annual utilization measures for the 74 children in the sample were analyzed by sex, age, race/ethnicity, hospital, discharge status, payer, and a severity-of-illness proxy. These measures were also compared with those for 3152 admissions of 1623 New Jersey adolescents and adults with AIDS hospitalized during 1987. Children with AIDS averaged 14.09 days and $8636 per admission, 4.35 admissions per year, and 60.96 days of hospitalization per year at an average cost of $37,110. The severity-of-illness proxy was the best predictor of hospital utilization and mortality. Hospitals varied widely in their proportions of very short and very long stays that signal possibly inappropriate utilization. Medicaid patients had relatively high utilization measures, and Hispanic children, relatively low measures. Per-admission utilization of children was similar to that of adults, but annual hospital utilization was significantly higher for children. Reimbursable outpatient and home care services appear to reduce inappropriate utilization.\r"

A case-control study revealed that 16 (62%) of 26 Kawasaki syndrome patients compared with 10 (20%) of 49 matched control subjects had a history of exposure to shampooed (19%) or spot-cleaned (81%) rugs or carpets within 30 days of the Kawasaki syndrome onset date (odds ratio = 5, P less than .01). The time of exposure to shampooed or spot-cleaned rugs or carpets for 9 of 10 Kawasaki syndrome patients who had a single exposure and for all 6 Kawasaki syndrome patients who had multiple exposures were clustered within an interval 13 to 30 days before the onset of illness. Although the reason for this unusually large outbreak remains obscure, it is the third in which a statistically significant association between Kawasaki syndrome and rug or carpet cleaning has been found.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to quantify more precisely the accuracy of magnitude of rectal temperature and total white blood cell (WBC) count as indicators of bacteremia in children with an obvious focal bacterial infection. A total of 955 children, aged 3 to 36 months, who had rectal temperature greater than or equal to 39.0 degrees C and were seeking care at either of two urban pediatric emergency departments had blood drawn for culture; 885 had blood drawn for WBC count. Twenty-seven had bacteremia. Various combinations of temperature and WBC count were selected to construct receiver-operating-characteristic curves by plotting sensitivity vs false-positive rate (1 - specificity). The receiver-operating-characteristic curve of WBC count provided significantly better diagnostic information than the curve for temperature increments above 39.0 degrees C. Each increment of 0.5 degrees C led to large decrements in sensitivity and false-positive rates. At a WBC count cutoff of 10,000/mm3, the sensitivity was 92% while the false-positive rate was 57%. Using this cutoff point, the clinician could have avoided performing 368 of 955 blood cultures and missed only 2 of 26 children with bacteremia. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves combining WBC count and temperature increments above 39.0 degrees C provided no better diagnostic information than that of WBC count at a temperature cutoff of 39.0 degrees C. It is concluded that increments in temperature above 39.0 degrees C provided additional diagnostic specificity for bacteremia only at the expense of unacceptable decreases in sensitivity. Total WBC count provided better information. A WBC count cutoff of 10,000/mm3 increased specificity with minimal decrease in sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Chemiluminescence and random and chemotactic motility of PMNs from preterm neonates were first evaluated at mean postnatal age of 9.8 days and then weekly for an ensuing 21-day period. For comparison, one blood sample was obtained for PMN functions from 14 healthy term neonates younger than 72 hours of age and seven normal adults. On day 1 PMN chemiluminescence and random and chemotactic motility values in preterm neonates were significantly lower (P less than .001) compared with those in term neonates and PMN function values of term neonates were significantly lower (P less than .001) than those of adults. Although initial PMN chemiluminescence and random and chemotactic motility values in preterm neonates were depressed, subsequent values on days 7, 14, and 21 increased significantly (P less than .002). On day 21 (mean postnatal age of 30.8 days) no differences existed in chemiluminescent activity and random motility between preterm and term neonates; chemotactic motility in preterm neonates, however, remained impaired. Mean cumulative age (gestational age at birth plus postnatal age) of preterm neonates on day 21 of study was 32.5 weeks, suggesting that chronologic age has more effect on maturational changes in PMN functions than gestational age.\r"

Univariate multiple regression analyses showed no direct relationship of blood lead levels to vitamin D metabolites or bone mineral content. Structural equation analyses which took into account potential covariates of age, season, race, and sex showed estimated declines in serum concentrations of total calcium (from 9.72 to 9.61 mg/dL), phosphorus (from 5.4 to 4.67 mg/dL), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (from 27.24 to 25.8 ng/mL) and estimated increases in concentrations of parathyroid hormones (from 73.03 to 83.14 microL Eq/mL), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (from 62.39 to 62.69 pg/mL), and bone mineral content (from 222.66 to 234.91 mg/cm) over the observed range of average lifetime blood lead concentrations (4.76 to 23.61 micrograms/dL, geometric mean 9.74 micrograms/dL). However, the only statistically significant effect of average lifetime blood lead concentration was that for phosphorus, and the multivariate test of the combined effects of lead on these six outcomes was not statistically significant (P = .2). It is concluded that significant alterations in vitamin D metabolism, calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and bone mineral content are not present in children whose nutritional status is adequate and who experience low to moderate lead exposure.\r"

Similar birth weight distributions and incidence of low birth weight were found among Chinese infants born in the three areas with markedly different economic conditions. The women in all three areas appear to have met the basic health and nutritional needs for adequate fetal growth. Similar incidence of low birth weight with different birth weight distribution was found among infants born in the United States to two Chinese parents, to one Chinese parent and one white parent, and to two white parents. The variation in birth weight is greater for white infants than for Chinese infants and, consequently, more white infants had larger birth weight. The possibility of race-specific influences on birth weight distribution is suggested by these findings.\r"

This overdose is primarily an opioid intoxication, occasionally associated with atropine toxicity. Only 6 of 36 children showed signs of atropine overdose (central nervous system excitement, hypertension, fever, flushed dry skin). Contrary to popular belief, atropine effects occur before, during, or after opioid effects. Opioid overdose (central nervous system and respiratory depression with miosis) predominated or occurred without any signs of atropine toxicity in 33 cases (92%). Diphenoxylate-induced hypoxia was the major problem and was associated with slow or fast respirations, hypotonia or rigidity, cardiac arrest, and in 3 cases cerebral edema and death. Respiratory depression recurred 13 to 24 hours after the ingestion in 7 cases and was probably due to accumulation of difenoxine, an active metabolite of diphenoxylate. Recommended treatment is intravenous naloxone for depressed or inadequate respirations, followed by continuous intravenous naloxone infusion, prompt gastric lavage, repeated administration of activated charcoal, and close monitoring for 24 hours.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-eight children who underwent corrective cardiac surgery in early infancy had developmental evaluations to explore whether cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion variables are associated with later cognitive function. All had transposition of the great arteries repaired by the arterial switch operation using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The mean duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was 64 +/- 10 minutes (mean +/- SD). Median age at repair was 4 days (range 1 to 125 days). Tests of development were administered at age 7 to 53 months: Bayley Scales for children younger than 30 months of age (n = 18) and McCarthy Scales for older children (n = 10). Overall cognitive development score was 101.2 +/- 11.1. Duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was not associated with performance. However, for core cooling periods of less than 20 minutes' duration, shorter cooling periods were associated with lower scores (r = .85, n = 11, P less than .001). These data suggest that patients undergoing relatively long periods of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest may require some minimum time of cardiopulmonary bypass cooling to avoid central nervous system injury.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of childhood blood pressure have shown tracking correlations, which estimate the magnitude of association between initial and subsequent measurements, to be lower than corresponding adult values. Inasmuch as this disparity could arise from failing to account for a larger week-to-week variability in children, blood pressure was measured for 4 successive years, on four weekly visits in each year, and with three measurements at each visit, using a random-zero sphygmomanometer, in a cohort of 333 schoolchildren aged 8 through 15 at entry. Ninety percent of subjects had measurements in 1 or more years of follow-up. For all follow-up periods (1, 2, and 3 years from baseline), the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure rose substantially with the number of weekly visits used to calculate each subject's yearly blood pressure (P less than .0001). For systolic pressure, the 3-year r values for 1, 2, 3, and 4 visits were .45, .55, .64, and .69, respectively. For diastolic pressure (Korotkoff phase 4), the corresponding values were .28, .41, .47, and .54. These higher multiple-visit estimates of tracking approximate published adult values and raise the possibility that prediction of adult blood pressure from childhood measurements may be improved by averaging readings from multiple weekly visits.\r"

Pediatricians need to be aware that if any one of these major anomalies is seen, this diagnosis should be considered. There now appears to be an established association between cardiac tumors and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Primary cardiac tumors have been associated with cerebral tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis, and evaluation of cardiac status is recommended when these genetically determined syndromes are diagnosed. This communication should serve to alert pediatricians to the need for complete cardiac evaluation and genetic counseling when a diagnosis of nevoid basal cell carcinoma is made.\r"

  ".W": "Autism is one of the behaviorally defined developmental disorders of brain function. It has a variety of genetic and nongenetic etiologies, with etiology being unknown in the majority of children. Boys are more frequently affected than girls. Manifest in the preschool years, autism always affects sociability, communication, and the child's repertoire of activities and interests. Autism encompasses children with a broad range of severities and a variety of other signs of brain dysfunction. These include motor signs, notably stereotypies; abnormal responses to a variety of sensory stimuli; and disorders of affect and attention. A significant proportion of autistic children experience epileptic seizures and have abnormal EEGs. Neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging, discloses abnormalities of brain development in a minority of autistic persons. The level of intelligence may range from profound mental deficiency to giftedness. The pattern of cognitive skills is likely to be uneven, typically with better nonverbal than verbal skills. In the preschool years, all autistic children have a developmental language disorder. Verbal expression may range from total lack of language to verbosity with echolalia; comprehension and language use are invariably impaired. While there is no specific pharmacologic agent to mitigate the fundamental disorder, children may benefit from drugs to treat specific symptoms such as attention disorder and seizures. Although autistic behaviors are the consequence of a static disorder of brain function, their character changes with maturation and appropriate intervention. Communication skills and sociability remain deficient but improve in all but the most severely affected children. Outcome is a function of both innate cognitive competence and the effectiveness of early intervention focused on the development of appropriate social skills and meaningful communication. Intelligent autistic adults may be educable, employable, and able to live independently, while more severely handicapped ones require a lifelong protected environment.\r"

Among cases of unknown etiology, there is ample evidence for a higher genetic liability to autism in siblings of autistic probands than expected from the population prevalence. It appears likely that both parents and siblings have a higher liability for social and cognitive deficits that are milder but conceptually similar to those found in autism. Others factors may alter this underlying genetic liability such as sex, IQ, and prenatal and perinatal injury. In the future, genetic analyses and genetic linkage studies will need to consider using a broader definition of the autism phenotype to include not only autism but severe cognitive and social deficits. The exact genetic mechanisms and genes involved are the subject of current investigations by several research groups. Investigations in this area are likely to continue to provide important information about the causes of autism.\r"

  ".W": "Based on neuroimaging and autopsy research, in autism no common site or type of abnormality appears in the cerebral hemispheres, thalamus, lenticular nuclei, and caudate nucleus. Nonetheless, further imaging and autopsy studies on this issue can be anticipated. Limbic system abnormalities have been reported at autopsy by one laboratory but not another, and no abnormality was found by the one quantitative MR study to measure a limbic structure. More autopsy and imaging research on the limbic system is needed. The cerebellum is the only anatomical structure for which there is both imaging and autopsy evidence of abnormality based on data gathered by many laboratories. Also, the only autopsy study to conduct statistical analyses of cerebellar cell loss found statistically significant Purkinje cell loss in both the vermis and hemispheres. Despite this, normal findings on routine radiologic examination are not of diagnostic significance at this time. On the one hand, the autopsy data show that most, if not all, autistic individuals have cerebellar cell loss, but on the other, research shows that MR images of the cerebellum in a substantial proportion of autistic individuals (perhaps 20% to 50%) will be indistinguishable from normal. Thus, it is likely that MR technology is not yet sufficiently sensitive to detect cerebellar abnormalities in all autistic persons who have them. Finally, the cerebellum seems an unlikely site of damage for a developmental disorder of higher cognition such as autism. However, new neurophysiologic and neuropsychologic studies of children with hemicerebellar resections and children with hemicerebellar resections and children with autism present an entirely new picture of the role of the cerebellum in normal human cognition in general and in the development of the social and communication deficits in autism in particular. These studies show that autistic subjects and patients with acquired cerebellar damage are unable to rapidly shift their mental focus of attention.\r"

Candidacy for transplantation is based on the absence of other illnesses that would limit survival or diminish the likelihood of success of the transplant. With the introduction of potent immunosuppressive agents, particularly cyclosporine (Sandimmune), survival rates after transplantation have improved to 90% at 1 year.

  ".W": "In the vast majority of cases, the cause of microcytic hypochromic anemia is clearly suggested by the patient history, physical examination results, red cell indexes, and peripheral blood smear. Thus, further diagnostic testing, if necessary, can be very selective. When the underlying cause of anemia is obscure, the serum ferritin concentration should be measured first. If it is normal or increased, serum iron and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels can be determined. The serum iron level is low in anemias caused by iron deficiency and chronic disease but normal or elevated in those resulting from the thalassemias, hemoglobin E disorders, and lead toxicity. The free erythrocyte protoporphyrin level is elevated with iron deficiency, the anemia of chronic disease, and lead toxicity but normal with thalassemias and hemoglobin E disorders. Results of these two test indicate which of the more specific tests is most likely to yield the correct diagnosis.\r"

A radionuclide bone scan should be considered when the index of suspicion for stress fracture is high. Plain radiographs are of little use in establishing the diagnosis in the early stages of the injury. Early diagnosis and prompt institution of conservative therapy allow for a favorable outcome in most cases. Avoidance of or reduced participation in the inciting activity is important for pain control. Certain stress fractures, such as those involving the femoral neck, should be monitored closely and treated aggressively with internal fixation when conservative measures fail. Runners who have exercise-induced amenorrhea should be advised to decrease their training intensity to a level where menses resume. Cyclic therapy with conjugated estrogens and progesterone should also be considered, as should daily calcium supplementation.\r"

However, the serologic findings have not been totally consistent among different study groups, and the antibody patterns in asymptomatic individuals may be similar. Moreover, patients with symptomatology indicative of CFS do not appear to have an abnormal burden of EBV in body fluids and manifest only a variable, mild degree of EBV-specific cell-mediated responses. The evidence is growing that the serologic findings of an enhanced EBV state in individuals with CFS-like manifestations, as well as the subsequent reports of increased antibody titers to other viruses, reflect a generalized underlying immunologic dysfunction in these patients. Future studies with criteria-defined CFS study groups in which determinations are made of antibody responses to newly identified EBV-associated nuclear antigen components and distinct EBV proteins in addition to specific virologic and immunologic analyses of EBV may be worthwhile as a means of clarifying the association between EBV and CFS.\r"

A resurgence of interest in the syndrome has followed reports suggesting that CFS may be associated with chronic active infection due to the Epstein-Barr virus. Analysis of reports to date shows that the mean titers of antibodies to viral capsid antigen and to early antigen are greater for patients with CFS than for healthy individuals; this is particularly evident in cases for which serial samples were tested. However, these differences do not prove the cause of CFS. Cell-mediated immune responses in patients with CFS vary from study to study, and the number and function of natural killer cells in those patients are the most variable factors. Rates of isolation of virus from saliva do not differ, but in one comparison study with a large number of subjects, more lymphocytes that contained virus were isolated from patients than from controls. Other viruses, such as the Coxsackie B virus, have been implicated as causes of CFS in studies from Great Britain. The use of a working definition of CFS and standardized tests to address abnormalities revealed by laboratory tests among homogeneous populations should allow determination of useful tests for the diagnosis of CFS and studies of its mechanisms.\r"

Health status was verified for all subjects by telephone, and diagnosis of CFS was confirmed by a physician. Information was collected on the following factors: symptoms of CFS among other family members; history of allergy/asthma; consumption of raw milk, raw eggs, raw cheese, or raw meat; water supply; exposure to animals; home heating source; proximity to farmland/orchards; tick bite; blood transfusion; camping; and appendicitis. Logistic-regression analyses indicated that the best model (characterized by symptoms among other family members, recent ingestion of raw milk, and history of allergy/asthma) produced significant estimates of relative risk (P less than .05) of 35.9, 44.3, and 23.3, respectively, for the three factors (corrections were made for the effect of the other covariates).

However, few specific diagnostic parameters for CFS exist, and the new definition may not delineate a single clinicopathologic entity. Future efforts at researching this illness should be aimed at identifying parameters that differentiate CFS from psychiatric conditions such as major depression and from other defined chronic diseases. Because CFS may be the result of multiple disease processes, the separate study of well-defined subgroups of patients with CFS is appropriate. Such subgroups of patients are probably more likely to have common pathogenetic features than are patients with CFS as a whole group.\r"
