Acute sera from 121 cholera patients were compared with sera from 2592 contemporaneous community controls. Each doubling of VC titer was associated, on average, with a 22%-47% reduction of cholera risk in the three groups. In contrast, in the two groups that did not receive BS, anti-CT titers were directly associated with cholera and thus served as markers of higher cholera risk. Each vaccine conferred approximately 65% protective efficacy against cholera, but antibody titers did not correlate with vaccine efficacy, indicating that serum VC and anti-CT antibodies are poor markers of the longitudinal pattern of vaccine efficacy.\r"

Cases were children less than 3 years old who presented between 1 January 1985 and 1 June 1986 for care of heat labile (LT) or heat stabile toxin-producing ETEC diarrhea. Controls were of similar ages and were randomly selected from three community-based serosurveys between July 1985 and May 1986. No association between blood group O and ETEC diarrhea was found for the 510 cases and 641 controls, nor was an association evident for cases of each toxin phenotype. Further refinement of the case definition to include only patients with LT-ETEC diarrhea, without enteric copathogens, also failed to reveal a substantial association with blood group O. These data suggest that a strong association with ABO groups, analogous to that for cholera, does not exist for ETEC diarrhea.\r"

LPS-lipoprotein binding in hyperimmune sera to E. coli J5 was not greater than that in normal serum as assessed by ultracentrifugation, but more LPS was precipitated from hyperimmune antisera than normal sera under conditions designed to precipitate LPS-lipoprotein complexes with calcium and dextran. Radiolabeled LPS was precipitated by delipidated antisera and fractions of IgG purified by anion exchange chromatography, but the precipitation was dependent on the presence of normal serum in the reaction mixture. These data suggest that a fluid-phase RIA done in the presence of normal serum may facilitate the detection of IgG in antisera raised to E. coli J5 that binds to heterologous smooth LPS.\r"

Also, the role of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in mediating the synovial inflammatory process was studied. Intraarticular inoculation of 2 pg to 20 ng of Hib LOS produced a dose-dependent increase in concentrations of leukocytes and protein in synovial lavage fluid that was significantly modulated by concomitant administration of rabbit TNF alpha- and rabbit IL-1 beta-specific antibodies. Inoculation of joints with either 10(4) IU of rabbit TNF alpha or 10 ng recombinant rabbit IL-beta induced synovial inflammatory changes similar to those observed after LOS intraarticular challenge. These data provide evidence for the role of Hib LOS in inducing suppurative arthritis and for the critical participation of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta in the initial events of the synovial inflammatory response.\r"

The MIC to penicillin or ampicillin was greater than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml for 274 (5%) isolates; 1 had an MIC of 4.0 micrograms/ml to penicillin. Seventeen (0.3%) were resistant to erythromycin (MIC, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), 157 (2.9%) were resistant to tetracycline (MIC, greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml), and 34 (0.6%) were resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (MIC, greater than or equal to 76 and 4 micrograms/ml). Isolates relatively resistant to penicillin represented 1.8% of isolates in 1979, 8% in 1982, and 3.6% in 1987. Sixty-five multiply resistant isolates were identified. Pneumococci from the southwestern United States (region 4) were more likely to be relatively resistant to penicillin. Using logistic regression analysis, serotypes 14 and 19A, isolates from region 4, and isolates from middle ear fluid were associated with penicillin resistance (P less than or equal to .008, chi 2.

The development of ciprofloxacin resistance in MRSA and MSSA was prospectively evaluated. After 3 months of ciprofloxacin use, high-level resistance (MIC90, 64 micrograms/ml) developed in MRSA and increased at an alarming rate, from none to 79% over a 1-year period. High-level ciprofloxacin resistance also developed in MSSA, increasing to 13.6% over the same period. Antibiograms, phage typing, and plasmid profile analysis suggest that more than one clone of MRSA developed resistance and that ciprofloxacin resistance is not associated with the acquisition of a new plasmid. Most patients had nosocomial acquisition and about one-half had a history of previous ciprofloxacin use. Ciprofloxacin resistance can develop rapidly in S. aureus; thus, ciprofloxacin appears to have limited usefulness in treating staphylococcal infections and colonization, especially those due to MRSA.\r"

Extracorporeal exposure of infected red cells to the dye and white light prevented the transmission of the disease in a transfusion model. P. berghei-infected red cells were more resistant to the antimalarial activity of MC 540 than were P. yoelii-infected cells, presumably because P. berghei preferentially infects reticulocytes whereas P. yoelii infects mature red cells.

The organism is commonly isolated from respiratory secretions of patients with other infections and often seems part of the resident flora; even when isolated from the bone marrow or bloodstream, its impact on the course of AIDS and contribution to systemic diseases are unknown. However, an increasing subset of patients without other documented opportunistic infections or malignancies has symptoms that respond to therapy directed against M. avium. Studies are in progress to evaluate chemotherapeutic agents. Accordingly, the subject is here reviewed and guidelines offered to infectious disease clinicians by one with a long-standing interest in mycobacterial disease who has made numerous contributions to the field.\r"

In situ hybridization (ISH) of tissues obtained after middle-gestation inoculation revealed TMEV in the placental decidua and spongiotrophoblast layers but generally not in the labyrinth (the layer adjacent to the fetus) or fetus (similar to late gestation). In contrast, ISH of placentas harvested after early-gestation inoculation identified TMEV predominantly in the labyrinth, in which vasculature was often replaced by hyalinized hemorrhagic tissue and small cell infiltrates; fetuses contained virus in heart, pericardium, great vessels, lung, pleura, brain, and liver. The placental barrier to enterovirus transmission appears to develop between early and middle gestation. Enterovirus infection before this time may induce placental damage, fetal infection, or both.\r"

Serum trough levels measured by antiidiotype ELISA were approximately 10 micrograms/ml after administration of 0.5 mg/kg and approximately 50 micrograms/ml after treatment with 2 mg/kg of SDZ 89-104 or SDZ 89-109. High serum levels defined by antiidiotype ELISA techniques closely paralleled increased neutralizing activity. Serum half-lives calculated from these data were approximately 6 days.\r"

Two such patients (CMV isolates ED50, 9.5-14.5 mumols) were treated with foscarnet, an antiviral pyrophosphate analogue to which both patients' isolates demonstrated in vitro susceptibility (ED50, less than or equal to 300 mumols). Each patient had documented retinitis progression, at 2- and 1- to 5-week intervals, respectively, despite high-dose intravenous ganciclovir therapy. Both patients responded to foscarnet therapy with cessation of viral shedding in urine and blood. After foscarnet therapy was started, retinitis stabilized in the two patients for 12 and 25 weeks, respectively, before progression recurred. Therefore, foscarnet may be effective in immunocompromised patients with rapidly progressive CMV retinitis whose CMV isolates have developed in vitro resistance to ganciclovir.\r"

Patients with chronic D hepatitis and HIV infection had significantly lower peripheral blood T4:T8 ratios resulting from a significant increase in T8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells, while numbers of T lymphocyte subsets were normal in cases with chronic D hepatitis only. HIV+ patients showed an increase in HBV replication (identified by hepatitis B core antigen in liver and hepatitis B e antigen and HBV DNA in serum) and in HDV replication (tissue D antigen and HDV RNA) without evidence of more active liver disease. Probably the immunologic disturbances detected in chronic D hepatitis are secondary to HIV infection, do not contribute to the pathogenesis of liver injury, and are associated with increased viral B and D replication.\r"

There was a correlation between the ability of organisms to survive in macrophages in vitro and their ability to cause invasive disease. Encapsulated Hib survived and replicated within macrophages, whereas capsule-deficient mutants, although more susceptible to phagocytosis, were killed after ingestion. Differences in lipopolysaccharide also affected the ability of encapsulated Hib to survive in macrophages. The presence of viable intracellular organisms in macrophages in vivo may enhance the persistence of bacteremia and may also be important in mediating the entry of Hib into the central nervous system.\r"

In a confirmatory study in mice, five-times-weekly intraperitoneal ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid, 1000 mg/kg, was not bactericidal for M. leprae, while amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 400 mg/kg five times weekly, was weakly bactericidal (80% +/- 14%).

The human immunodeficiency virus-negative patient responded completely to ketoconazole; the patient with AIDS died of progressive disseminated infection despite treatment with fluconazole and amphotericin B. Epidemiologic investigation suggested a common source of infection, but serologic evaluation and environmental cultures were unrevealing. EcoRI digestion of the Blastomyces dermatitidis isolates showed identical restriction fragment patterns that differed from patterns obtained from other clinical isolates. Analysis using a Histoplasma capsulatum ribosomal DNA probe that cross-hybridizes with B. dermatitidis showed that the isolates from the two patients were identical and different from others. Thus, the patients were probably infected with the same strain, possibly from a common source. These data indicate the critical role of cellular immunity in patients with blastomycosis, show that there are multiple genotypes of B. dermatitidis, and suggest that DNA restriction analysis is a useful epidemiologic tool.\r"

For treatment, the qualification period can be used to test and adjust therapeutic dosages, to exclude placebo responders, and to confirm early responsiveness to long-term active therapy. For intention-to-treat analyses, the qualification period can allow special stratifications for patients who are therapeutically difficult to regulate or who comply imperfectly. By offering the cited improvements as well as a brief \"pilot exposure\" for each patient, the qualification period can also enhance the \"informed consent\" and general ethics of a trial.\r"

The relative risks of death in comparison to the normoglycaemic group were 1.6 for impaired glucose tolerant and 2.3 for diabetic subjects; for death due to coronary heart disease: 1.7 and 2.3 respectively; for death due to alcohol and cirrhosis: 7.0 and 13.3 respectively. It appears that in this cohort a proportion of subjects screened as diabetic have impaired liver function and disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, due to excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol should be investigated as a possible risk factor for diabetes, particularly in epidemiological studies where diabetes is diagnosed by the oral glucose tolerance test and the population has a high consumption of alcohol.\r"

The aim of the study was to determine the best index for describing the relationships between the body fat pattern and the metabolic risk profile. The four age-adjusted circumference ratios (waist/hip, waist/thigh, xiphoid/hip, xiphoid/thigh) showed similar associations with the metabolic variables whereas the three age-adjusted skinfold ratios (epigastric/thigh, mesogastric/thigh, hypogastric/thigh) tended to be more weakly associated with the metabolic variables, particularly with apolipoprotein (Apo) B and fasting glucose. Multiple regression analyses showed that age-adjusted BMI was significantly related to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, Apo A and Apo B, and blood pressure, independently of abdominal fat distribution. After controlling for the effects of BMI, the waist/thigh ratio remained significantly associated to triglyceride, Apo B, fasting glucose, and systolic blood pressure, whereas the waist/hip ratio and the mesogastric/thigh skinfold ratio were significantly related only to triglyceride and systolic blood pressure independently of BMI. With the exception of triglyceride and fasting glucose, the degree of association between the metabolic variables and the abdominal fat distribution tended to be weaker than that observed with the BMI. These results emphasize the importance of the global corpulence in the levels of metabolic variables. However, all indices of abdominal fat distribution were, to varying degrees, independently associated with an unfavorable metabolic profile. Among them, the waist/thigh circumference ratio seems to be a useful indicator of the body fat pattern in women.\r"

Over 1200 patients in the metropolitan Montreal area were screened. Of these, 348 patients were recruited to enter a 4-week stabilization period, and 184 were subsequently randomized to receive either active or sham negative pressure ventilation. A 5-day in-hospital period was used to train patients in ventilator use and obtain baseline measures of exercise capacity, lung function, respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Home ventilation treatment took place during a following 12-week period. Respirator use was recorded both from patient logs and from concealed meters installed in the units. Patients received four home visits by physiotherapists during the 12-week period and returned for follow-up to the hospital 4 and 12 weeks post-discharge for reassessment.\r"

In this paper, we used factor analysis techniques to reduce multiple outcome measures to a lesser number of orthogonal dimensions. The data were obtained from 119 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each patient had measurements made of 28 variables, including multiple parameters of pulmonary function, exercise tolerance and gas exchange. Factor analysis using a maximum likelihood iterative solution was performed. The factors were then rotated to a varimax solution. The analysis yielded four meaningful factors: exercise tolerance, disease severity, lung volumes and flow rates. Exercise tolerance and disease severity were the most important factors accounting, respectively, for 44 and 13% of the common variance. For further analyses, these composite factors could be used or a representative clinical measure from each factor might be chosen. We conclude that many physiologic measures provide highly correlated information about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Factor analysis may help reduce these measures into a smaller number of reliable composites.\r"

Trained abstracters reviewed hospital charts to record personal, diagnostic, and clinical information, and survival was determined for all patients through the end of 1979. Patients diagnosed in university hospital cancer centers underwent more staging procedures and tended to be assigned to a higher stage than similar patients diagnosed in community hospitals. When tumor stage was considered as a covariable in a survival analysis, these patients appeared to have a lower mortality rate both for non-small cell tumors (mortality rate ratio, 95% confidence interval = 0.81, 0.71-0.91) and for small cell tumors (0.71, 0.55-0.91). When functional status rather than tumor stage was used to adjust for disease severity, there was no apparent survival advantage for university patients with non-small cell cancer (0.96, 0.85-1.09) and the lower mortality for small cell cancers (0.76, 0.59-0.97) was attenuated, although still statistically significant. We conclude that inconsistently-collected data on clinical stage can complicate comparisons of prognosis between cancer patients from different types of hospitals and that measures of performance status may be more useful indicators of disease severity in population based studies.\r"

Osler's maneuver (OM), the palpability of a pulseless artery, is recommended as a non-invasive test to detect pseudohypertension, despite limited data concerning its reproducibility. We assessed the maximum achievable inter-and intra-observer agreement of OM among 6 examiners: cardiologists, geriatricians and general internists. Each examiner performed OM twice on 65 elderly hypertensive men attending the general medicine and geriatric clinics. The inter-observer agreement for brachial and radial examinations was 79 and 70%, while intra-observer agreement was 82 and 75%, respectively. After adjusting for chance agreement the kappa values for inter-observer agreement for brachial and radial arteries were 0.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21-0.55) and 0.37 (0.28-0.46), respectively. Similarly, the kappa values for intra-observer agreement were 0.45 (95% CI: 0.35-0.55) and 0.49 (0.39-0.59). Kappa values never exceeded 0.6 in any time period, suggesting no training effect. OM cannot be recommended as a screening test for pseudohypertension given this low inter- and intra-observer agreement.\r"

A questionnaire was administered to identify factors contributing to the high rate of follow up to this point in the study. The attitudes of the staff, feedback to the subjects, the staff's handling of questions and problems, and association with the Framingham Heart Study emerged as the most important factors influencing continued participation in the study. In addition, 99% of the subjects stated that they believed the medical research to be important. We conclude that the quality of the communication with study participants and the subjects' perceived importance of the research have been the key factors in maintaining the cohort in this longitudinal epidemiologic study.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study conducted by mail questionnaire and with a large proportion of surrogate responders, we found differences in smoking habits, age at diagnosis, tumour cell type distribution and occupational exposures between men and women who developed primary lung cancer. This study was designed to confirm those findings by conducting personal case interviews and extend them by examining the impact of certain biological factors. We have investigated demographic, smoking, occupational and medical history sex differences in cases with primary lung cancer by interviewing 273 male and 103 female cases diagnosed between November 1983 and July 1986. The females were significantly younger at diagnosis, a pattern consistent for all cell types. Squamous cell (40%), small cell anaplastic (20%) and adenocarcinomas (16%) were the most prevalent cell types in men. In women, similar frequencies of adenocarcinomas (32%) and squamous cell carcinomas (29%) occurred. Despite a higher prevalence of physician diagnosed allergy and asthma among women, minimal sex differences in the prevalence of atopy as measured by prick skin test were found. Female cases were more likely to be lifetime non-smokers (15% vs 3%), to have started smoking on average 3 years older and to smoke 6 fewer cigarettes per day. The mean pack years of female cases was significantly lower than males' for squamous, adenocarcinoma and small cell anaplastic tumours. The majority of these women had not been occupationally exposed to any substance known to be carcinogenic or to damage the lung. However, in a small subset of cases pulmonary function variables were as depressed in women as in men with significantly higher mean pack years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to determine their accuracy, they were compared to body fat measured by underwater weighting and total body water determination in 29 males and 75 females who varied widely in body composition. Relative weights calculated from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables correlated so highly with BMI that these measures can be considered to be identical (R2 = 0.992 to 0.999). Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between BMI and percentage body fat in men (R2 = 0.68, %fat = 0.99 X BMI -1.32, p less than 0.001) and women (R2 = 0.74, %fat = 0.94 X BMI + 10.77, p less than 0.001). We conclude that relative weight and BMI are nearly identical, and that they are reasonable estimates of body fatness.\r"

  ".W": "Whether or not to treat patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation with anticoagulants to prevent embolic stroke is a dilemma for physicians. If randomized trials, currently underway, demonstrate a beneficial effect, the dilemma will not be solved because not all of the relevant factors can be addressed by trials. We used current knowledge about non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation and a method of obtaining patient-derived weights for avoiding stroke from eight medically trained subjects, to determine the overall benefit of anticoagulants and to see what factors were relevant and what effect each might have in deciding whether to use anticoagulant therapy. Using standard assumptions, anticoagulants gave an expected benefit for all subjects. The expected benefit (expressed in terms of lives per 1000 saved due to anticoagulants) varied between 5.4 and 46.7. This benefit remained for all subjects when we did a sensitivity analysis for different rates of stroke prevented by anticoagulants and different rates of intracranial hemorrhage caused by anticoagulants. When we used different baseline rates of stroke and different impacts of major hemorrhagic complications the benefit disappeared for 3 and 4 subjects respectively. We found the factors that were most crucial to the decision will not be included in randomized trials; the weight that an individual would place on avoiding embolic stroke vs the risk of intracranial bleeding from anticoagulant therapy; and the rate of embolic stroke that could be expected for the subject at risk. Factors which will be measured in randomized trials, will change results less substantially: the increased risk of major hemorrhages; the proportion of strokes that could be prevented by treatment; the increase in risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This method of analysis suggests that for most patients anticoagulants are beneficial and that the most important factor in determining this result is the value that subjects put on different outcomes.\r"

The FFI was examined for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct and criterion validity. A total of 87 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were used in the study. Test-retest reliability of the FFI total and sub-scale scores ranged from 0.87 to 0.69. Internal consistency ranged from 0.96 to 0.73. With the exception of two items, factor analysis supported the construct validity of the total index and the sub-scales. Strong correlation between the FFI total and sub-scale scores and clinical measures of foot pathology supported the criterion validity of the index. The FFI should prove useful for both clinical and research purposes.\r"

Insulin was positively correlated with serum glucose, body mass index (BMI), skinfold thickness, waist/hip ratio and sucrose intake, and negatively correlated with heavy physical activity score, treadmill exercise duration, and magnesium intake (each p less than 0.01). After adjustment for other covariates, the positive association of insulin with waist/hip ratio, skinfold thickness, and sucrose intake remained in the group as a whole, as did the negative associations with magnesium and treadmill duration. These relationships provide insight into potentially modifiable factors affecting insulin levels, and should be considered in interpreting associations between insulin levels and cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "The International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) was established in 1982 to strengthen the research capacity of medical schools in the developing world through the development of Clinical Epidemiology Units (CEUs). The role of these units is to promote a rational approach to clinical and health care decision making, drawing on the methods of clinical epidemiology, biostatistics, health economics and health social science. This paper summarizes the evolution of the INCLEN model and the experience to date. Progress with Phase 1, the designation of sites for CEU development and the provision of advanced research training by developed country training centres has been substantial. The network now consists of 27 units: 26 in developing country medical schools in Asia, Latin America, India and Africa and 1 in France. More than 60% of the target of 270 fellows have completed training and returned to take up faculty positions in their unit. The remainder will be trained and on site by 1995. The non-return rate of fellows (2%) is very low. Research productivity is significant given only 60 fellows have been working in their CEUs for more than 3 years following the completion of training. An appropriate balance between hospital and community-based research is evident and changes in clinical and health care policy have been made based on the research conducted. The educational responsibilities of all units include courses and workshops in critical appraisal and clinical epidemiology for medical trainees and colleagues. Graduate training programs have emerged in 3 units so far. Major challenges lie ahead as we move into Phase 2 of the project--self sustainability and the transfer of training responsibility to the CEUs. The problems encountered during Phase 1 will need to be addressed. These include time protection for research, the limited availability of research funds, the low priority given to research careers and the poor linkage between health researchers and government policy makers. Our experience echos the recommendations of the recent report of the Commission on Health Research for Development, namely that donors and national governments should give increased priority to the role of health research in less developed countries. We conclude that with continuing support and special attention to the problems encountered, the INCLEN approach can contribute to ensuring that the medical establishment is part of the solution rather than the problem faced by health systems in less developed countries.\r"

The metabolic pattern, indexed by blood pressure, blood glucose, uric acid, serum triglycerides, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol was summarized in a haemodynamic-metabolic score (HMS). Association of HMS with age, anthropometric variables (skinfold thicknesses, girth lengths) and degree of overweight (body mass index, BMI) was evaluated in males and females using multiple regression analysis. Body fat location was associated with metabolic status independent of age in both sexes. This association was also independent of the degree of overweight. BMI, in general, was associated with HMS to a greater extent than anthropometric variables, except for waist girth; when its effect was taken into account BMI did not significantly improve the prediction power of HMS values in males. Among skinfolds, epimesogastric showed in both sexes the highest association with HMS. These results support the abdominal adiposity hypothesis and suggest that waist circumference could be a good index for assessing metabolic status. The abdominal location of adipose tissue, more than just the degree of overweight, could play a role in obesity related disorders.\r"

Custom-made splints allowed accurate and reproducible positioning of the measurement probe. The data showed a significant reduction in vascular supply at the final observation. However, a high variability of individual blood flow patterns was found. In some patients, transient periods of ischemia were observed shortly after surgery. Also, numerous teeth demonstrated hyperemia at later intervals. One patient developed discoloration of a central incisor, and another lost marginal periodontal support around both central incisors.

An unusual factor in the presentation of false aneurysms following Le Fort I osteotomies is an initial episode of epistaxis occurring greater than 2 weeks postoperatively. Arteriovenous fistulas following orthognathic surgery are more apt to involve large vessels, especially the internal carotid artery.

All but one of the infected fractures were in the angular region of the mandible. Teeth had been extracted from the fracture line in 9 of the 10 dentulous patients. It was concluded that erroneous techniques had been used in almost all infected cases, because compression could not be achieved when there was an irregular fracture line, an atrophic edentulous mandible, or inadequate stability due to removal of a tooth in the line of fracture. In five patients, successful reoperation was performed using a reconstruction plate. Detailed radiologic examination was useful in assessment of infection and in follow-up.\r"

In this study, postnatal maxillary growth was evaluated in three groups of animals: 1) unoperated controls, 2) unrepaired CL, and 2) repaired CL. The animals were killed at 4, 12, and 26 weeks after birth. Direct cephalometry was performed on dry skulls to evaluate premaxillary width, anterior maxillary length and width, and posterior maxillary width. The results of this study indicate that rabbits that undergo an in utero CL procedure, with or without repair, exhibit no significant decrease in maxillary length and width when compared with controls.\r"

  ".W": "A histologic study was undertaken to define the microanatomic characteristics of two commonly injured peripheral trigeminal nerve branches (lingual and mandibular nerves) and the two nerves most frequently procured for use in their interpositional graft repair (sural and greater auricular nerves). Nerves, obtained from fresh human cadavers, were evaluated for total fascicular area, fascicle number, axon number, axon size, and axon density. The peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve (third division) were morphometrically similar, with only a slight decrease in axon density in the lingual nerve. Comparisons between the donor nerves, however, showed numerous discrepancies at the axonal level. While the fascicular area of the sural nerve was only slightly smaller, axon numbers and densities were only one-half that of the trigeminal nerves. Although the greater auricular nerve was appreciably smaller in overall size, a much better correlation existed with the trigeminal nerve in axonal qualities. These microanatomic findings raise questions about the potential capability of these graft choices to optimally restore axonal connections between nerve ends in trigeminal nerve repair.\r"

Sixty-five percent of these patients were men, 25% were diabetic, and 94% were smokers, with an average age of 62 years. Patients were followed for a mean interval of 24 months. Life-table survival was 92% at 3 years. All surviving patients showed \"significant\" postoperative improvement by use of Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery combined clinical and vascular laboratory criteria. There were three early and five late graft thromboses. Primary and secondary life-table patencies were 85% and 92%, respectively, at 3 years. Dacron bifurcation grafts were selected to match the size of native arteries. Patients receiving small diameter grafts, defined as 12 mm (n = 9) and 14 mm (n = 39), were compared with patients receiving large diameter grafts of 16 mm (n = 26) and 18 mm (n = 5). Small diameter grafts were more likely to be used in women (p less than 0.01), but patient groups were otherwise comparable with respect to age, smoking history, diabetes, outflow status, operative indications, type of proximal anastomosis (end-to-end or end-to-side), location of distal anastomosis (common femoral vs deep femoral), type of graft construction (knitted vs woven), and functional result. Graft diameter did not influence life-table patency, which was 84% for small and 87% for large diameter grafts at 3 years (p = 0.74). Furthermore, none of the other variables listed above influenced graft patency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 30-day operative mortality rate for the entire group was 18% (10 patients). Before July 1987, 19 patients (group 1) were operated on by use of a technique previously described. In these earlier patients the peritoneum was routinely entered, the diaphragm was divided radially, and no heparin was given. Among patients in group 1 there was a 30-day operative mortality rate of 42% (8 patients), and morbidity included myocardial infarction 4 (21%), respiratory failure 9 (47%), renal failure 12 (63%), bleeding requiring reoperation 4 (21%), and intestinal ischemia 3 (16%). Since July 1987 a standardized approach to all elective thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms has been used in 38 patients (group 2). This method uses a left thoracoabdominal incision, circumferential division of the hemidiaphragm, retronephric totally extraperitoneal aortic exposure, single lung anesthesia, full heparinization, the graft inclusion technique, and liberal use of visceral endarterectomy. Patients in group 2 sustained a 30-day operative mortality rate of 5% (2 patients) and morbidity included myocardial infarction 2 (5%), respiratory failure 10 (26%), renal failure 11 (29%), bleeding requiring reoperation 1 (3%), paraplegia 6 (16%), and paraparesis 4 (11%). Modern surgery for repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm results in acceptably low operative mortality rates. Spinal cord ischemia remains an unresolved source of morbidity.\r"

Duplex imaging was used to evaluate 95 extremities (78 patients) with current venous ulceration to determine the location of incompetence in each extremity. In addition, in 91 of the 95 extremities the area of the venous ulcer was evaluated for the presence of perforating veins or any other superficial veins or both conditions. Sixty-three (66.3%) of the 95 extremities had multisystem incompetence (superficial and perforating plus superficial and deep plus perforating and deep plus superficial and perforating and deep), whereas single system incompetence (superficial plus perforating plus deep) was seen in only 26 (27.3%). Isolated deep incompetence was identified in only two extremities (2.1%). Furthermore, 45% (41/91) of the ulcers had no duplex evidence of any venous abnormality in the ulcer bed. These data show that the site of valvular incompetence occurred in multiple locations, that isolated valvular incompetence of the deep venous system was uncommon, and that perforating veins were not always in the ulcer bed itself. Because standard venous surgery has traditionally been directed toward only one system, this may provide one explanation for ulcer recurrence. Therefore complete venous evaluation with duplex imaging allowing for surgical intervention directed specifically to the sites of involvement in each system is recommended.\r"

In this study we describe a new valvulotome and technique of angioscopically directed valvulotomy and review the video tape recordings of 85 completion angioscopies of in situ femorodistal bypasses. Fifty-three vein grafts were prepared with the blind retrograde valvulotomy technique and 32 vein grafts with the new valvulotome and angioscopy. The use of the new valvulotome and technique is compared with that of the standard blind retrograde valvulotomy technique, and the normal endoluminal anatomy and incidence of primary disease in saphenous vein grafts was noted. The incidence of valvulotome-induced injury was 5/32 (15.6%) and 45/53 (85%) in vein grafts prepared with angioscopically directed valvulotomy and blind retrograde valvulotomy, respectively. Residual competent valves were found in 10/53 (18.9%) in blind retrograde valvulotomy and 0/25 of angioscopically directed valvulotomy vein grafts (p = 0.0114). In 22/53 vein grafts unsuspected primary disease was detected. Angioscopically directed valvulotomy with the new valvulotome and technique is feasible, reliable, and safe. It avoids residual competent valves, minimizes valvulotome-induced injury, and allows the detection and correction of unappreciated primary vein graft abnormalities. The new valvulotome and technique is a first step in the complete endoluminal preparation of the in situ vein graft.\r"

Thus the pseudointima at the midportion of the graft may represent a nidus for persistent platelet activation. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of the maturing graft surface on platelet activation. Long Dacron subcutaneous carotid to aorta grafts (50 cm x 8 mm) were placed in nine dogs. Blood samples were obtained by direct graft puncture, at the proximal and distal ends of the graft, at 1, 24, 48, 72 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks, and monthly thereafter for 8 months. Seven sham dogs had subcutaneous grafts implanted without arterial anastomoses, and blood samples were drawn from the femoral artery. Platelet counts were determined with a platelet counter. Platelet aggregation and release of adenosine triphosphate was determined with a whole blood aggregometer by use of arachidonic acid, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate as agonists. No difference was found in platelet aggregation to collagen or adenosine diphosphate stimulation across the graft, but platelets released significantly less adenosine triphosphate to collagen and adenosine diphosphate stimulation distally versus proximally. In the graft dogs a decrease in systemic platelet counts of 50% occurred from the preoperative level which persisted over 8 months (p less than 0.01). Also less response occurred to collagen and ADP stimulated platelet aggregation in the graft animals than the sham animals during the first month of study. These data suggest that significant platelet-graft interactions occur even after the graft has formed a mature pseudointima.\r"

  ".U": "91245634\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the safety of intraaortic balloon pump catheter insertion for critical coronary ischemia through suprainguinal prosthetic bypass grafts, we examined our experience of 19 intraaortic balloon pumps placed through grafts in 17 patients by means of surgical exposure (8) or the percutaneous (11) approach. Fourteen intraaortic balloon pumps were placed through matured grafts at a time remote (2 to 13 years; mean, 7 years) from their vascular bypass surgery. Five were inserted through nonmatured grafts during the same hospitalization as their vascular reconstructive surgery (1 to 12 days; mean, 4 days). One patient, a day after an aortoiliac bypass, died during an urgent, surgical intraaortic balloon pump insertion for cardiogenic shock. All other patients had prompt reversal of their cardiac ischemia. Decreased limb perfusion developed during use of the intraaortic balloon pump in three patients, all of whom had their intraaortic balloon pump placed percutaneously through mature grafts. Two of these required surgical thrombectomy. Ten intraaortic balloon pump insertions in eight patients survived the hospitalization and were followed for a mean of 24 months (range, 2 weeks to 64 months). No localized groin or graft infections were identified. No bleeding complications or pseudoaneurysms occurred. Thus in patients with unstable, severe, cardiac disease, intraaortic balloon pumps can be safely placed through indwelling suprainguinal bypass grafts.\r"

  ".W": "We compared duplex scanning, \"bright blood\" and \"black blood\" magnetic resonance angiography, and conventional angiography for evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries. All three methods were applied to 39 vessels in 20 patients. Duplex scanning was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in six instances. In three instances the degree of stenosis was overgraded by the scanner, and in three cases the stenosis was undergraded. Magnetic resonance angiography was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in three instances. In all cases magnetic resonance angiography overgraded the degree of stenosis. By use of a greater than 70% stenosis as a positive study, the sensitivity of magnetic resonance angiography was 100% and the specificity 92%. With use of the same criteria, the sensitivity of duplex scanning was 86%, and specificity was 84%. In those evaluations where the results of the magnetic resonance angiography and duplex scanning were in agreement, the correlation with conventional angiography was 100%. We conclude that magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative means to duplex scanning for noninvasive carotid imaging. A combination of bright and black blood magnetic resonance angiography is precise in delineating lesions of the extracranial carotid artery and may ultimately eliminate the need for conventional angiography in the evaluation of carotid stenosis.\r"

Since these techniques may require preoperative preparation, it is useful to determine in advance how much exposure will be needed and to select the most suitable and effective technique. We used anatomic dissection in 12 human cadaver specimens (24 carotid bifurcations) to define the limits of distal internal carotid artery exposure by several commonly advocated methods. The standard anterior approach along the sternocleidomastoid muscle allowed exposure of the internal carotid artery to the level of the upper one third of the second cervical vertebra. The upper limit of this exposure was extended to the middle of the first cervical vertebra by division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Anterior subluxation of the mandible increased the distal exposure of the internal carotid artery to the superior border of the first cervical vertebra. Styloidectomy in combination with the preceding maneuvers extended the exposure an additional 0.5 cm cephalad. Lateral mandibulotomy did not significantly extend exposure beyond that obtained with mandibular subluxation and styloidectomy. Exposure of the internal carotid artery in the 1 cm immediately below the base of the skull required a posterior approach with mastoidectomy.\r"

Ocular pneumoplethysmography and transcranial Doppler sonography tests were performed within a week before and after operation, and transcranial Doppler sonography was repeated greater than or equal to 30 days after operation. Middle and anterior cerebral arteries were insonated bilaterally, and flow velocities ipsilateral (iMCAFV or iACAFV) and contralateral (cMCAFV or cACAFV) to the side of surgery were recorded. The iMCAFV and iACAFV increased significantly in the immediate postoperative period, and the iMCAFV remained elevated on the second follow-up study. Patients with greater than or equal to 75% ipsilateral carotid stenosis (N = 23) had increased iMCAFV, iACAFV, and decreased cACAFV after operation, whereas those with less than 75% stenosis (N = 13) had no significant transcranial Doppler sonography changes. Those with greater than or equal to 75% contralateral carotid stenosis (N = 17) had significant increases in iMCAFV, cMCAFV, and iACAFV after operation, whereas those with less than 75% contralateral carotid stenosis had no significant transcranial Doppler sonography changes. A subset of patients (N = 13) did not increase iMCAFV after surgery. The ocular pneumoplethysmography changes were significantly different in both groups when preoperative and postoperative values were compared. We conclude that carotid endarterectomy can cause lasting cerebral hemodynamic changes, but that its effects are not uniform among all patients.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic and metabolic consequences of microvascular occlusion, often present in the runoff bed of distal arterial reconstructions, have been difficult to quantitate clinically. To investigate these pathophysiologic relationships, a porcine hindlimb model was developed in which arteriolar patency, which we term outflow capacity, may be quantitatively defined and reduced by serial distal microembolization with 70 microns flow-directed glass bubbles. In 10 anesthetized adult pigs, hindlimb perfusion was limited to femoral artery flow (FAF) by collateral ligation. Serial measurements of outflow resistance (OR), femoral artery flow, and resting muscle pH (mpH), a metabolic index of tissue perfusion, were made as relative outflow capacity (ROC) underwent graded reduction from 1.0 (baseline) to 0 (complete occlusion). Femoral artery flow decreased linearly (FAF = 87 ROC - 3), and outflow resistance increased in hyperbolic fashion (OR = 1.66/ROC) in response to graded peripheral microembolization, whereas resting muscle pH followed a more complex relationship (In mpH = 0.055 ROC + 1.95). An integrated analysis of these results suggests that a 50% to 60% reduction in arteriolar patency represents a critical point beyond which outflow resistance rises rapidly and hindlimb flow decreases to levels that are inadequate to support the metabolic demands of resting tissues.\r"

Amelioration of these changes has been reported by preoperative administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, but heterogeneity in patients' intravascular volume status has confounded analysis of the drugs' effects in previous studies. We studied hemodynamic conditions in 24 volume-loaded (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than 10 mm Hg) patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair under general plus epidural anesthesia, after preoperative double-blind administration of either ibuprofen 800 mg (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The hemodynamic response to aortic cross-clamping was similar in both groups. Pulse and mean arterial pressure remained unchanged; cardiac index decreased after aortic cross-clamping from 2.4 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) to 2.1 +/- 0.1 1/min/m2 in the ibuprofen group and from 2.5 +/- 0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.2 1/min/m2 in the placebo group (p less than 0.01 versus preclamp values in both groups, multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA]), but improved after declamping. Both left and right ventricular stroke work indexes followed a similar pattern. Plasma 6-keto prostaglandin Fl alpha (6-k-PGF1 alpha) increased transiently from a baseline level of 304 +/- 44 to 2083 +/- 698 pg/ml plasma in mixed venous blood 30 minutes after incision in the placebo group (p less than 0.05), but no other significant change in plasma 6-keto prostaglandin Fl alpha or in thromboxane B2 occurred in either group at any other time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Six millimeter disks of graft were placed in separate flasks (specific for each antibiotic) containing albumin in saline and continuously agitated. At daily intervals the solution was changed, and paired graft samples were removed and placed on a blood agar plate confluently streaked with bacteria. The initial zone of inhibition (centimeters squared), the time to 50% reduction of initial inhibition zone, and the overall duration of antibacterial activity were recorded on an exponential model. Grafts bonded with amikacin and chloramphenicol had an overall duration of activity of only 2 and 1 day, respectively, against Staphylococcus aureus. The collagen bonded rifampin grafts had an initial zone of 14.76 cm,2 took 3.92 days to reach 50% of initial inhibition, and had an overall duration of activity of 22.4 days. This was significantly better than grafts preclotted with 1.0 ml of rifampin (60 mg/ml) and 9 ml of blood (10.92 cm,2 1.06 days, and 5.6 days). When tested against a slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis (American Type Culture Collection No. 35983), the graft bonded with rifampin had inhibitory activity of up to 27.77 days with a 50% of activity eluted at 4.78 days, significantly better than the preclotted rifampin graft without collagen bonding. These data suggest that rifampin bonded by collagen can protect a vascular graft against infection from S. aureus and S. epidermidis for up to 3 weeks after implantation.\r"

This procedure presently requires cardiopulmonary bypass. To modify atrioventricular conduction without cardiac surgery, we evaluated the electrophysiologic effects of cryolesions applied to the peri-nodal area in the closed heart in 16 dogs before operation, during cryothermic exposure, and at 1 hour and 3 hours after operation. The electrophysiologic effects were evaluated in 10 of the 16 dogs at 2 weeks postoperatively. The dogs were given general anesthetics, and a cryoprobe was introduced into the right atrial cavity through the right atrial appendage. Cryolesions (-60 degrees C) were placed at nine to eleven preselected points around the perinodal area guided by electrodes on the tip of the cryoprobe. Postoperatively, there were significant prolongations of the atrio-His interval, Wenckebach's point, effective refractory period, and functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node. Atrial echo beats were eliminated or decreased in frequency. There was also a significant increase in retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction time. In the long-term observation period the atrio-His intervals remained significantly prolonged in comparison with the preoperative values, the atrial echoes progressively decreased, and ventriculoatrial conduction was absent in five of seven animals. A serendipitous atrioventricular node reentry tachycardia that was inducible in one animal with dual atrioventricular node conduction pathways was successfully eliminated and was not inducible at 2 weeks postoperatively. Complete atrioventricular block occurred during attempts to produce greater atrio-His prolongation in three of the 16 animals and persisted in two for the 2-week period of observation. Closed heart intracardiac cryomodification of atrioventricular conduction is feasible, with the cryoprobe in normothermic blood, producing changes in atrioventricular conduction similar to the open cardiac procedure.\r"

Nine patients and nine control subjects matched for age and sex were studied. The anatomy of the main pulmonary artery and its main branches, as well as the site of arterial anastomoses, was identified and measurements of their diameters were taken. There were no significant differences in diameters of these vessels between the patients and the control subjects. Arterial blood flows to the transplanted lung were 2.07 +/- 0.45 L/min/m2 in the group with right lung transplantation and 2.43 +/- 0.60 L/min/m2 in those with left lung transplantation compared with 1.22 +/- 0.22 L/min/m2 and 1.27 +/- 0.41 L/min/m2 in the control group, respectively. The ratio of blood flow in the transplanted and the native lungs in all patients studied was 2.8 +/- 0.83:1. The flow profile in the artery of the transplanted lung showed a wide forward flow during systole and most of diastole, whereas that of the native lung showed a narrow early systolic peak and a reverse flow in most of diastole. These differences in the volume and pattern of flow in the transplanted lung are most likely related to the relative resistance in the native and the transplanted lung and could constitute an additional index for monitoring the condition of patients with lung transplantation and help in the understanding of the physiology of the denervated pulmonary vascular bed.\r"

  ".W": "Reperfusion injury is a limiting factor in lung transplantation. Deferoxamine is an iron chelator that inhibits the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals. We investigated the effects of deferoxamine on posttransplantation lung function in a canine model of single lung transplantation. Twelve dogs underwent left lung transplantation after 20- to 24-hour hypothermic storage in a modified Euro-Collins solution. In six experiments donor and recipient received a 10 mg/kg dose of deferoxamine before harvest and transplantation, and 10 mg/kg was added to the preservation solution. Arterial oxygen tension, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, pulmonary vascular resistance, and dynamic lung compliance were measured. Data were recorded for 6 hours after ligation of the native pulmonary artery. At the end of the study the mean arterial oxygen tension was 175.1 mm Hg for the deferoxamine treated group versus 71.1 mm Hg for the control group (p less than 0.001), and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was less in the deferoxamine-treated group: 502.3 versus 606.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance was lower throughout the study, and after 6 hours it was 455.1 dynes/sec/cm(-5) in the deferoxamine-treated group versus 663.7 dynes/sec/cm(-5) in the control group (p less than 0.035). Compliance was similar in both groups. We conclude that deferoxamine improves lung preservation and early posttransplantation function in canine single lung transplantation.\r"

To elucidate cellular events involved in such lung injury, we examined the effects of warm ischemia on the cytotoxic function of lymphocytes retrieved by bronchoalveolar lavage as compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes. Warm ischemia of the lung was induced in eight dogs by crossclamping left hilar structures for 1 hour. Bronchoalveolar cells from ischemia left and unaffected right lungs, as well as blood lymphocytes, were isolated before operation and 2 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days after operation. Lung and blood lymphocytes were assayed for natural killer and lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Warm ischemia resulted in a significant impairment of natural killer activity within 2 hours of reperfusion (49% of preoperative control cytolysis, p less than 0.01). There was a significant increase in natural killer activity in bronchoalveolar lavage mononuclear cells 72 hours after reperfusion injury (178.4% of preoperative value, p less than 0.01). Interestingly, these functional alterations were not paralleled with changes seen in the peripheral blood lymphocytes or the opposite nonaffected lungs, where the natural killer activity appeared significantly depressed at 72 hours. Similarly, lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was noted to be increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage from the ischemic lung (179.5%, p less than 0.01) but decreased in the bronchoalveolar lavage from the nonaffected lung and peripheral blood lymphocytes at 72 hours after injury. We conclude that warm ischemia is associated with a functional alteration of the local lung immune cells. Such alteration is not observed in cells from the opposite lung or peripheral blood. The observed increase in nonspecific cytotoxicity of bronchoalveolar lymphocytes can be causative in the early damage seen in poorly preserved lung allografts.\r"

  ".W": "As one of the requirements of the Department of Veterans Affairs cooperative study on valvular heart disease, operative and postoperative data were prospectively collected in 964 patients undergoing single valve replacement. The procedure was performed either by a resident under the direct supervision of an attending surgeon (49.5%) or by an attending surgeon (50.5%). There was no difference in operative mortality between the two groups of surgeons when adjusted for patient-related and disease-related risk factors. The proportion of patients who had at least one postoperative complication was slightly but not significantly higher in the attending group (35.8% versus 30.4% for aortic valve replacement, 38% versus 28% for mitral valve replacement, and 36% versus 30% for all single valve replacement procedures). As the significance of each complication varies, we weighted each complication to the associated operative mortality to formulate the morbidity score. An expected complication rate for each group was derived from a multivariate logistic model, and the ratio of observed to expected morbidity was calculated to adjust observed morbidity according to the risk of patients. There was no difference in the observed/expected morbidity ratio between the two groups of surgeons. We conclude that currently used teaching techniques and philosophy to educate cardiac surgical residents, which allow them to take progressive responsibility for cardiac surgical procedures, are well justified, and patient care does not suffer when resident training is enhanced.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations of mechanical valve sounds have shown that (1) frequency spectra of sounds produced by abnormal valves differ from those of properly functioning valves and (2) leaflets of normally functioning bileaflet valves do not close synchronously. This investigation studied effects of mechanical valve size, environment, and hemodynamic state on closing sounds. A single 25 mm bileaflet mitral mechanical valve was implanted in six sheep and a single 27 mm valve in four sheep. With digital signal processing, asynchronous leaflet closure and frequency spectra were assessed after alterations in animal position, respiratory phase, heart rate, afterload, contractility, and preload. Both asynchronous leaflet closure and frequency spectra varied among animals, and, except for a decrease in asynchrony with increasing contractility, were largely independent of valve size and hemodynamics. Baseline asynchrony ranged from 0.5 to 4.2 msec. Frequency spectra were characterized by the first three resonant peaks. Lowest resonant peaks ranged from 2.5 to 3.4 kHz, middle from 4.7 to 6.8 kHz, and highest from 7.2 to 9.6 kHz. These results indicate that accurate assessment of mechanical valve function with acoustic analysis requires baseline studies in all patients by means of a system with a frequency response of more than 10 kHz.\r"

Myocardial infarction develops in 11% to 49% of these patients, with 18% to 46% of infarcts resulting in new Q waves. Since February 1987 a revised protocol for myocardial preservation has been used in 19 patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty. Cardioplegia is induced with a normothermic blood cardioplegic solution. Multiple maintenance doses of cold (4 degrees C) blood cardioplegic solution are then delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. Before the aortic crossclamp is removed, normothermic reperfusion cardioplegic solution is delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. This group was compared with all patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty before February 1987. These 45 patients received cold induction of cardioplegic solution, multiple maintenance doses of cold cardioplegic solution, and no reperfusion cardioplegic solution. The prevalence of myocardial infarction in the group receiving cold cardioplegic solution was 65% versus 26% in the group receiving normothermic cardioplegic solution (p less than 0.007). Multivariate analysis identified the use of the normothermic cardioplegia protocol (p less than 0.005), nontotal occlusion of the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.03), and presence of collateral flow to the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.04) as being independently associated with absence of myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the long-term outcome of the sequential aorta-coronary bypass grafting technique, we compared the results in 234 patients with single venous grafts (group I) with those of 234 patients with predominantly sequential grafts (group II). All were symptomatic for angina pectoris before operation and had either three-vessel or left main stem coronary artery disease. Operations were performed from March 1975 to June 1980. The mean follow-up period was 10.5 years (minimum 8.5; maximum 13.6). The perioperative mortality rate in group I was 3% and in group II, 1% (not significant). The survival probability at 5 years after operation for group I was 90% +/- 2% and for group II, 88% +/- 2%; at 10 years, 71% +/- 3% and 72% +/- 3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis elicited no risk difference related to graft type: group II versus group I hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.16 (not significant). Regarding depressed left ventricular function versus normal function, an increased risk was observed: 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.35 to 2.75), as was the case for advanced age: 60 years or more versus less than 60 years, 1.6 (1.1 to 3.5). Thus the sequential venous grafting technique seems to have the same 10-year results as single venous grafts.\r"

  ".W": "Ebstein's anomaly appearing during the neonatal period carries a high mortality rate. These infants exhibit cyanosis, acidosis, and congestive heart failure. The pathophysiologic characteristics consist of severe tricuspid regurgitation and functional pulmonary atresia. As a result of the inability of the right ventricle to generate forward flow through the pulmonary arteries, these infants remain dependent on ductal patency. Since May 1988, five newborn infants with severe Ebstein's anomaly have been admitted for treatment at our institution. At initial examination, they weighed 3.6 +/- 1.8 kg and had a mean oxygen tension of 29.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg and a mean pH of 7.20 +/- 0.05. Chest roentgenography demonstrated a mean cardiothoracic ratio of 0.81 +/- 0.02. As determined by echocardiography, the right atria were massively enlarged, severe tricuspid regurgitation was present in all patients, and the pulmonary valves were not opening. All infants were dependent on prostaglandin E1 and attempts to wean them from this drug were unsuccessful. Palliative treatment consisted of tricuspid closure with autologous pericardium and an aortopulmonary shunt of 4 mm polytetrafluoroethylene tubing. There were no operative or late deaths. At discharge, mean oxygen tension was 42.2 +/- 0.85 mm Hg and mean systemic oxygen saturation was 83.2% +/- 1.94%. Infants have grown satisfactorily during the follow-up period. Three infants have since returned for further surgical intervention. One infant, at 11 months of age, underwent a Glenn anastomosis for progressive oxygen desaturation. Two infants have returned, at ages 23 and 22 months, for Fontan procedures, which represent their definitive operative management. We believe this new procedure offers excellent palliative treatment for Ebstein's anomaly in critically ill neonates. Feasibility of later definitive correction is demonstrated by the good results obtained with the Fontan procedure in two infants.\r"

Their ages ranged from 15 days to 48 years. Eight patients (53%) were younger than age 1 year. Evidence of congestive heart failure was present in five infants, whereas three infants, three children, and two adults initially had signs of pulmonary venous obstruction, and two children had a heart murmur only. Five patients had cor triatriatum alone; in ten cases there also was an atrial septal defect. Associated anomalies in four patients included left superior vena cava, ventricular septal defect and left superior vena cava, partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and bilateral partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Cor triatriatum was repaired with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass in all patients. Excision of the membrane was accomplished with a right atrial approach in 13 patients and a left atriotomy in one patient. Both atria were opened in one case. All associated anomalies were simultaneously corrected. Three patients (20%) died early after operation. Among the 12 survivors, no late events have occurred, and all of them are presently in New York Heart Association functional class I. A recent echocardiogram shows absence of residual obstruction or shunt and good development of the left cardiac chambers.\r"

To determine variables associated with recoarctation, we entered preoperative and operative data into a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Patient weight was an incremental risk factor for recoarctation instead of age, in contrast to previously published studies. Furthermore, the residual gradient after the operation was a strong incremental risk factor. This risk factor was even more significant when expressed as a ratio of the systolic arm pressure, which takes background hemodynamics into account. Because weight is a more significant risk factor than age, we conclude that deferring operation is indicated only when the infant gains weight. Furthermore, a residual gradient is more important in the hemodynamic setting of a lower systolic arm pressure.\r"

From the resulting two groups each, one patient was excluded from the study because of postoperative myocardial infarction (control group) and surgical hemorrhage (aprotinin group) leading to a second operation. Although heparin was used for anticoagulation in all 22 patients, all had a marked increase in plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes during extracorporeal circulation, indicating an intravasal activation of coagulation. By monitoring the plasma levels of fibrin degradation products in patients without aprotinin therapy, we recorded a concomitant hyperfibrinolysis significantly less pronounced in patients receiving aprotinin (p less than 0.005). The mean total postoperative blood loss was lower in patients receiving aprotinin (620 ml) than in control patients (1000 ml; p less than 0.03). The results confirm previous reports of a hemostyptic effect of aprotinin in cardiac operations. This effect is probably due to a prevention of hyperfibrinolysis.\r"

We measured plasma levels of thromboxane, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in infants with pulmonary hypertension, some of whom were treated medically and some of whom were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plasma levels of all three prostanoids were elevated in infants with pulmonary hypertension and decreased with time, whether the neonates were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or with medical management alone. In infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we collected samples simultaneously from preoxygenator sites, postoxygenator sites, and umbilical artery catheter. We could demonstrate no significant difference in plasma prostanoid levels across the oxygenator. In two patients, plasma thromboxane and prostaglandin F2 alpha levels measured shortly after a platelet transfusion were distinctly higher in the umbilical artery catheter than in venous samples.\r"

Indications for lead extraction were life-threatening septicemia (30%), complications of free-floating leads (2%), abandonment of pockets (40%), and replacement of malfunctioning leads (28%). Extraction tools included flexible, telescoping sheaths advanced over the lead to dilate scar tissue and apply countertraction, deflection catheters, and wire basket snares. Countertraction is defined as the direct force of traction on the lead countered by the circumference of an extraction sheath. One hundred sixty-four leads were extracted through the superior vena cava by advancing the sheaths over the lead to the myocardial wall. Most of these leads passed through the subclavian vein. An approach through the inferior vena cava was used for the remaining 62 leads. The countertraction sheaths were passed from the femoral vein into the right atrium. A maneuvering catheter and an extracting snare were placed inside the sheaths. The lead was positioned by the maneuvering catheter, entangled in the extracting snare, and the sheaths advanced over the snare and lead to the myocardium. An atriotomy by means of a limited surgical approach was required to free one lead. One infected lead broke 5 cm from the electrode and was removed through a median sternotomy, ventriculotomy, and retrograde extraction. All patients had unremarkable recoveries. Intravascular countertraction techniques proved to be a viable alternative, minimizing the risks and morbidity of lead removal.\r"

We investigated the effects of endurance training on waking and sleeping blood pressure and on baroreflex sensitivity in 16 borderline hypertensive patients. First, 8 patients were assessed before and after a 6-month endurance training programme. Then, when it was clear that blood pressures were lower after training, a further 8 patients were studied not only at the end of the training programme but also after 4 months' abstention from exercise (detraining). Measurements were taken of baroreflex sensitivity (response to iv phenylephrine), blood pressure, R-R interval, and blood pressure and R-R variability. Ambulatory blood pressures were measured in 13 patients (7 trained, 6 detrained) and sleep blood pressures in 6 patients (3 trained, 3 detrained). Increased fitness was associated with a decline in resting arterial blood pressure of 9.7 (SE 2.0) mm Hg systolic and 6.8 (1.2) mm Hg diastolic, and with a decline in ambulatory blood pressure of 4.8 (1.4) mm Hg and 7.5 (2.1) mm Hg, respectively; both p less than 0.05. Baroreflex sensitivity was 14.0 (1.8) ms/mm Hg in the unfit and 17.5 (2.0) ms/mm Hg in the fit; p less than 0.05. Sleep blood pressures were not lower in the fit despite longer sleep R-R intervals. These findings indicate that, in some subjects with borderline or mild hypertension, a physical training programme is sufficient to bring the blood pressure within normal limits.\r"

Substantial amounts of the human 60 kD homologue (hsp60) were produced by insertion of the gene into Escherichia coli. To investigate the hypothesis that T-cell reactivity is directed against the endogenous hsp, T-cell proliferation of synovial-fluid and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in response to hsp60 was studied in samples from six patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) and nine adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There was no T-lymphocyte proliferative response to purified fractions of hsp60 in mononuclear cells from RA patients or healthy children and young adults. However, both synovial-fluid and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from JCA patients showed substantial proliferative responses. There was a significant correlation between the stimulation indices for human hsp60 and for mycobacterial hsp65 (r = 0.948, p less than 0.02). A similar correlation for hsp60 and mycobacterial hsp70 did not achieve significance. Immunohistochemistry showed that hsp65 and hsp70 homologues were expressed in the synovial membrane in these patients but not in controls. These findings suggest a sequence of events in which hsps become expressed during synovial inflammation and function as autoantigens. In JCA this may be manifested by specific T-cell reactivity which apparently is lost in the more bone-eroding and non-remitting adult disease.\r"

A 59-year-old man with adult-onset CD required resection of a segment of oedematous jejunum. Histological examination of this tissue revealed an intense intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Immunophenotypic (CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, CD34-, and CD45 RO-) and cytogenetic (deletion of the Y chromosome and chromosome 9) abnormalities were found, together with monoclonal T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements. Some patients with adult-onset CD may have low-grade lymphoma from the outset of their illness.\r"

To establish whether this age-related reproductive failure results from diminished oocyte quality or uterine/endometrial inadequacy we investigated ovum donation in 35 infertile women, aged 40 years or older (mean 42.7 [SE 0.3]) who had failed at attempts at conception with their own (self) oocytes. Oocytes were donated by 29 young individuals (mean age 33.4 [0.7]) undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). 8 (5.3%) pregnancies were achieved in 150 cycles of ovulation induction with self-oocytes and 2 (3.3%) in 60 such cycles by in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), but none attained viability. By contrast in 50 cycles with donated oocytes 28 (56%) pregnancies and 15 (30%) deliveries were realised (p less than 0.005). The rate of implantation per embryo transferred was higher (14.7%) with donated oocytes than that with self-oocytes (3.3%) (p less than 0.01). To further elucidate the contribution of age to reproductive outcome, pregnancy results were compared between the young donors and older recipients. Both donors and recipients shared oocytes from the same induced cohort. Rates for clinical pregnancy and delivery did not differ between donors (33% and 23%) and recipients (40% and 30%). Our data suggest that the age-related decline in female fertility is attributable to oocyte quality and is correctable by ovum donation. The uterus can adequately sustain pregnancies even when reproductive potential is artificially prolonged into the late 40s.\r"

Between 1985 and 1988 we investigated the degree and causes of the social gradient in morbidity in a new cohort of 10,314 civil servants (6900 men, 3414 women) aged 35-55 (the Whitehall II study). Participants were asked to answer a self-administered questionnaire and attend a screening examination. In the 20 years separating the two studies there has been no diminution in social class difference in morbidity: we found an inverse association between employment grade and prevalence of angina, electrocardiogram evidence of ischaemia, and symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Self-perceived health status and symptoms were worse in subjects in lower status jobs. There were clear employment-grade differences in health-risk behaviours including smoking, diet, and exercise, in economic circumstances, in possible effects of early-life environment as reflected by height, in social circumstances at work (eg, monotonous work characterised by low control and low satisfaction), and in social supports. Healthy behaviours should be encouraged across the whole of society; more attention should be paid to the social environments, job design, and the consequences of income inequality.\r"

Seasonal differences were similar, in both timing and degree, for total mortality and deaths from circulatory disease, but were greater in Kuwait for respiratory disease. Peak mortality was during winter in both areas: in Grampian, when the climate is most uncomfortable, and in Kuwait, when the climate is at its most comfortable. Socioeconomic changes in Kuwait have been accompanied by a rapid fall in the degree of seasonality (deseasonality) for both total and infant mortality. These findings suggest that mortality peaks in winter, not because of a seasonally low temperature, but because of a seasonal fall in mean temperature irrespective of the annual mean temperature.\r"

Our findings suggest that some diseases associated with toxic compounds or modifications of the human genome can be diagnosed by expert systems that analyze protein maps. The combination of protein mapping and computer analysis could result in a clinically useful \"molecular scanner\". The massive amount of information analyzed and stored in such studies requires new strategies, including centralized databases and image transmission over networks. Increased understanding of protein expression and regulation will enhance the importance of the human genome project in medicine and biology.\r"

The image-analysis program contains a complete set of general-purpose tools for image manipulation and processing, as well as specific tools for clinical analysis of cardiac and vascular images obtained by various techniques. Most of these features were designed to communicate information through color-coded graphic displays. Ten novice users were given a brief introduction to the program and asked to perform eight analytic tasks. The overall success rate was 95%, and the subjects considered the program easy to use without a manual or formal training. We conclude that with a well-designed graphic interface, physicians without training in the use of computers can easily learn to manipulate and analyze medical images.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Infection with astroviruses has been associated with gastroenteritis in children, and serologic surveys indicate that this infection may be frequent. The importance of astroviruses as agents of gastroenteritis has not been shown in a controlled study, however. METHODS. We used monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassays to detect astroviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and rotaviruses in stool samples obtained from age-matched children with and children without gastroenteritis. The samples were obtained in two studies, three years apart, among patients attending an outpatient clinic in Bangkok, Thailand. RESULTS. In the first study, astroviruses were detected in 8.6 percent (96 of 1111) of the children with gastroenteritis and in 2.0 percent (19 of 947) of the children without gastroenteritis. In the second study the rates were 8.6 percent (50 of 580) and 2.1 percent (11 of 512), respectively. For both studies combined, enteric adenoviruses were detected in 2.6 percent of those with gastroenteritis and in 0.5 percent of the controls, whereas rotaviruses were detected in 19 percent of those with gastroenteritis and in 1.0 percent of the controls. The clinical findings associated with astrovirus infection were similar to those associated with rotavirus infection, except for a trend toward greater dehydration in the children infected with rotaviruses. CONCLUSIONS. These two controlled studies involving a total of 3150 Thai children provide evidence that astroviruses are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Astroviruses were found in association with gastroenteritis more frequently than were enteric adenoviruses, and with nearly half the frequency of rotaviruses.\r"

  ".U": "91246273\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes the triglyceride core of chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins and has a crucial role in regulating plasma lipoprotein levels. Deficiencies of lipoprotein lipase activity lead to aberrations in lipoprotein levels. Worldwide, the frequency of lipoprotein lipase deficiency is highest among French Canadians. We sought to determine the molecular basis of the disorder in this population. METHODS. The entire coding sequence of the lipoprotein lipase gene from one French Canadian patient was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Exon 5 from 36 other French Canadian patients was amplified and analyzed by dot blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. RESULTS. Sequence analysis revealed a missense substitution of leucine (CTG) for proline (CCG) at residue 207 in exon 5. This mutation was found on 54 of the 74 mutant alleles (73 percent) in the patients. Studies of site-directed in vitro mutagenesis have confirmed that this mutation generates inactive lipoprotein lipase and is the cause of lipoprotein lipase deficiency. CONCLUSIONS. We have identified a missense mutation at residue 207 of the lipoprotein lipase gene that is the most common cause of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in French Canadians. This mutation can be easily detected by dot blot analysis, providing opportunity for definitive DNA diagnosis of the disorder and identification of heterozygous carriers.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Sclerotherapy is an effective treatment for bleeding esophageal varices in patients with alcoholic liver disease. It has also been suggested that sclerotherapy might be effective in preventing initial episodes of bleeding and improving survival among such patients. METHODS. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing prophylactic sclerotherapy and sham therapy in 281 men with alcoholic liver disease who had at least three variceal channels and no history of variceal bleeding. All the patients underwent endoscopy; 143 received sclerotherapy, and 138 received sham therapy. RESULTS. The two patient groups were well matched at entry with respect to the extent of liver disease and other clinical indexes, except that other medical illnesses were significantly more common in the sclerotherapy group. The study's data-monitoring board terminated the trial 22.5 months after it began because the rate of mortality from all causes was significantly higher in the sclerotherapy group (32.2 percent) than in the sham-therapy group (17.4 percent, P = 0.004), despite the fact that the men who received sclerotherapy had significantly fewer episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding. The causes of death varied, and there is no obvious explanation for the excess mortality in the sclerotherapy group. After the termination of treatment, the excess mortality rate in the sclerotherapy group promptly declined. There were 53 episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (including 10 from esophageal varices and 9 from esophageal ulcers) in the sclerotherapy group and 40 episodes (including 19 from esophageal varices) in the sham-therapy group. Complications of sclerotherapy were frequent but seldom life-threatening. CONCLUSIONS. For unknown reasons, prophylactic sclerotherapy is associated with increased mortality among men with moderate-to-severe alcoholic liver disease and esophageal varices. Sclerotherapy should not be performed until after an initial episode of bleeding from esophageal varices has occurred.\r"

Fourteen months following the procedure, visual acuity in a patient with a pedicle graft had improved from counts fingers to 20/400 and the patient fixated over the transplanted RPE cells. After 10 months, a homologous graft in a second patient had become encapsulated with a fine subretinal membrane without neovascular tissue; visual acuity had not improved.

All of these patients had been examined the day after surgery and, if no complications were noted, had been instructed only to refrain from activities that produced pain. No shield was required, and no instructions were given to restrict showering, hair washing, or any other normal physical activity. We found no complications related to any postoperative activity. These results suggest that current postoperative instructions typically restricting such patients' activities should be reevaluated.\r"

Three of the four patients with endogenous endophthalmitis died within 4 weeks of diagnosis. We describe a second case of postoperative endophthalmitis due to this fungus. The infection was successfully eradicated following vitrectomy, corneoscleral resection, and patch graft, in addition to intraocular, topical, and oral antifungal medication. Although in vitro sensitivities are variable, P. boydii is known to be relatively resistant to amphotericin B. This points to the importance of proper cultures and sensitivities when treating cases of suspected fungal endophthalmitis. Unfortunately, the patient's eye became phthisical 6 months following the initial intervention.\r"

Patients' (n = 112) levels of pain and distress were measured using a VAS pain scale, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Scale and the MMPI. Patients with primary myalgia had the highest scores on the pain and distress measures while patients in the combination group scored between the myalgia and TMJ problem subgroups. When differences in pain levels were controlled, the differences among groups on measures of anxiety and depression were attenuated while the differences on measures of somatic overconcern remained significant. Discriminant function analysis using psychological variables to predict diagnostic grouping produced correct identification of 74% of the structural patients and 46% of the myalgia patients. Implications for different etiological factors among the 3 groups are discussed.\r"

Measures of social support, conflict, and pain were drawn from subscales of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, the Family Environment Scale, and the Interpersonal Relationship Inventory. Patients with myofascial disorders reported significantly worse pain (sensory and affective), higher depression scores, more interpersonal conflict, and less support from others than patients with arthritis, but did not differ from them on personality traits. Also, the contributions of conflict to pain were found to depend on the nature of the chronic disorder and on the source of the conflict, i.e., significant other, family, or social network members. For patients with arthritis, less intense pain (sensory and affective) was associated with higher family conflict. Less intense sensory pain in arthritis was also associated with more punishing responses from the significant other to pain. For patients with myofascial disorders, more intense affective pain was associated with higher social network conflict. Social support did not significantly contribute to pain for either group. Thus, chronic painful disorders may differ on the influences that social relationships have on pain. The implications of these differences for treatment are discussed.\r"

Half of the subjects who received this suggestion reported pain. The frequency and intensity of pain reports in a group which was given prior pain experience as a reference point in reporting pain and in a group which was exposed to a manipulation designed to reduce intentional deception were not significantly different from the pain reports of a group not exposed to these manipulations. The frequency of pain reports in subjects not connected to the sham stimulator but still asked to report pain was 25% which was significantly less than the frequency for subjects who were told there would be stimulation to the head. Pain ratings increased as the settings of the sham stimulator were increased. Subjects who reported pain had significantly fewer electrodermal responses to tones signaling them to prepare for a reaction time task. The results suggest that pain can be produced in the absence of peripheral stimulation. The pain does not appear to be due to intentional deception or the lack of a standard for comparison, but is strongly influenced by environmental cues. Psychophysiologically, pain responders were less attentive to signal stimuli.\r"

Two related factors that influence interpretation of these reported outcomes are discussed, namely, noncompliance with therapeutic recommendations during treatment and subsequent to treatment termination, and relapse. Conceptual and methodological problems for establishing the prevalence of noncompliance and relapse are reviewed. Several factors that contribute to noncompliance (individual differences, nature of disease or injury, characteristics of the prescribed treatment regimen, health-care provider-patient relationship, and contextual) are discussed. The literature reveals that noncompliance with treatment regimens is quite prevalent across diverse treatment modalities and pain syndromes. The incidence of relapse following initially successful treatment of persistent pain also appears to be high, ranging from 30% to 60%. Studies on arthritis and heterogeneous pain clinic populations suggest that noncompliance and relapse are related; however, this association is less well established for headache patients. Strategies for assessing compliance (i.e., self-report, behavioral, biochemical, and clinical outcome) and the perspectives' of patients and health-care providers on the application of self-care recommendations are discussed. Strategic planning and adherence enhancement tactics to facilitate maintenance of post-treatment gains are described.\r"

  ".W": "Few validated instruments are available to assess beliefs and attitudes that patients have regarding pain, or ability to function despite discomfort. The Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (PAIRS) was developed to tap these important beliefs and attitudes in chronic pain patients. Preliminary data indicate that the PAIRS is internally consistent and significantly related to impairment in a highly selected pain clinic sample of patients, including some chronic low back pain patients. The present study was designed to extend the validation of the PAIRS to a more general sample of chronic benign low back pain patients. Furthermore, additional tests supported the discriminant, convergent and divergent validity, as well as the reliability and relative independence from favorable self-report response bias of the PAIRS, by respectively demonstrating that: (1) the impairment beliefs assessed with the PAIRS were more prominent in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients than in matched non-pain, healthy controls; (2) scores on the PAIRS were significantly related to measures of physical impairment, but not to physicians ratings of disease severity; (3) the impairment beliefs assessed with the PAIRS are readily distinguishable from cognitive distortions and emotional distress; (4) PAIRS scores for chronic low back pain patients are relatively consistent over time; and (5) PAIRS scores are not significantly associated with measures of favorable self-report response bias. We conclude that the PAIRS has demonstrated at least preliminary utility for applications by researchers and clinicians interested in chronic pain.\r"

Patients used visual analogue scales to rate pain, anxiety, and satisfaction for each method. Behavioral observations were made by an observer and a nurse. Paired sample t tests were used to compare the 2 drug delivery methods for patient, observer, and nurse ratings across assessment periods. There were no significant differences between methods for ratings of anxiety before or during the procedure. The injection of lidocaine was rated as more painful by the observer and nurse (with a trend for patients) than the use of iontophoresis. But, the patients and nurse rated the injection method as more effective. Iontophoresis was never rated as superior to the injection method, even after turning over control of drug delivery by iontophoresis to the patient (sessions 2 and 3). Patients were more satisfied with iontophoresis at session 2 when they took over control, but lost enthusiasm by session 3. Three subjects withdrew from the study due to cutaneous burns and prolonged anesthesia delivery time with iontophoresis. Iontophoresis appears to be effective in reducing the pain of dialysis needle insertion but requires further investigation before it can be considered a viable alternative to subcutaneous injection.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine if electrical stimulation of vagal afferents inhibited activity of primate spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons located in cervical segments of the spinal cord. Previous studies show vagal inhibition of STT neurons in more caudal segments of the cord, which receive visceral spinal inputs and somatic inputs from proximal body regions. We hypothesized that activation of vagal afferents would inhibit cervical STT neurons that were excited by cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferents and not inhibit those cells inhibited or unaffected by this visceral input. Because visceral pain is referred to proximal somatic fields, we also hypothesized that STT neurons with excitatory somatic fields confined to distal areas would not be inhibited by vagal stimulation. In 42 cervical STT neurons, we found no difference in effects of vagal stimulation between cells excited or not excited by stimulation of cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferents. Responses to vagal stimulation also were the same for cervical STT cells with proximal or distal somatic fields. Furthermore, there was no difference in the inhibitory effects of vagal stimulation in cervical as compared to thoracic STT neurons. We concluded that vagal afferent stimulation causes a general inhibitory effect at all levels of the spinal cord on neurons which transmit nociceptive information.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 88 somatosensory neurones were recorded from n. anterodorsalis, n. anteroventralis, n. lateralis dorsalis, n. lateralis posterior and n. centralis lateralis of rabbit thalamus. Among the 88 neurones, 50 were noxious-excited (convergent, n = 36; non-convergent with long latency responses, n = 14), 23 noxious-inhibited and 15 non-convergent neurones with short latency responses that were activated by innocuous stimuli only. Iontophoresis of etorphine predominantly depressed the late burst of the response to strong sural nerve stimulation in convergent neurones (25/26), the depression being readily blocked by iontophoresis of naloxone (16/16). After naloxone, the late burst was occasionally larger than that before etorphine. Etorphine depressed non-convergent neurones with long latency responses (13/13), but had no marked effects on non-convergent neurones with short latency responses. On the noxious-inhibited neurones, etorphine could enhance the inhibitory response when it was weak prior to drug administration (12/12). Contrary to etorphine, naloxone could block the inhibitory response when it was administered either iontophoretically (15/15) or intravenously (4/4). Naloxone could enhance the weak late burst of the evoked response in convergent neurones (2/2). Similarly to etorphine, electroacupuncture depressed noxious-excited neurones, convergent (18/18) and non-convergent neurones with long latency responses (6/6), the depression being blocked by naloxone (16/16). The results suggest that noxious inputs may activate the release of opioid peptides onto opiate receptors, the interaction of which mediates the modulation of thalamic nociceptive transmission.\r"

Although the adequacy of opioid substances in alleviating neuropathic pain is highly controversial, the effects of morphine (1 mg/kg i.v.) and naloxone (1 mg/and 3 micrograms/kg i.v.) were tested 1-2 weeks after the nerve ligatures were established, when pain-related behaviours were well developed. Morphine (1 mg/kg i.v.) induced a potent and prolonged decrease in the pain-rating score at week 2 after surgery. Either at week 1 or week 2, naloxone elicited a bidirectional dose-dependent action: a further increase in the pain-rating score with the high dose (1 mg/kg i.v.), and a paradoxical decrease in the score with the low dose of 3 micrograms/kg i.v. These effects are comparable to those already described in several rat models of inflammatory pain and, in the same model of neuropathy, using a phasic nociceptive test, the measure of the vocalization to paw pressure. A few differences in the effects of naloxone on tonic and phasic pain are noted and discussed.\r"

Further evaluation is usually unnecessary if the lung scan is interpreted as normal (diagnosis excluded) or high-probability (diagnosis accepted). However, if the lung scan is indeterminate (referring to all other interpretations), additional diagnostic studies are usually required. Newer trends in the management of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis include a more aggressive initial regimen of heparin; simultaneous administration of warfarin with heparin, resulting in a shorter duration of heparin therapy; use of the international normalized ratio to monitor warfarin therapy; and use of a less intense warfarin regimen. Adjusted-dose subcutaneous heparin therapy and low-intensity warfarin therapy are newer prophylactic techniques for patients at moderate to high risk for deep venous thrombosis.\r"

Most anaerobic infections are polymicrobial. Because anaerobes are difficult to culture, diagnosis is often made on the basis of clinical clues. Thus, knowledge of the common sites, predisposing conditions, and other representative features of anaerobic infections is critical. For anaerobic infections above the diaphragm, where Bacteroides fragilis is not a common isolate, high-dose penicillin G therapy is usually sufficient. Addition of clindamycin (Cleocin) or metronidazole (Flagyl, Metryl, Protostat) may be necessary for serious infections. Cefoxitin sodium (Mefoxin) or clindamycin is adequate for most anaerobic infections occurring outside the central nervous system. Metronidazole, chloramphenicol, imipenem, or beta-lactam antibiotics combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors may be preferable for serious infections. Appropriate coverage for aerobic bacteria must be included in the treatment regimen. Drainage of abscesses, decompression of infected spaces, debridement of necrotic tissue, and removal of foreign bodies are critical in management of many anaerobic infections.\r"

Treatment includes relief of neuropathic pain and antibiotic therapy for infection. Pentoxifylline (Trental) improves microvascular flow and appears to be effective against peripheral vascular disease. Aldose reductase inhibitors are being investigated as therapy for diabetic neuropathy. Prevention is the mainstay of management in these patients.

Their mechanism of action in lowering blood pressure targets elevated peripheral vascular resistance, which is the principal hemodynamic abnormality of essential hypertension. The alpha 1 blockers maintain cardiac output and blood flow to vital organs, and they do not affect renin release. These agents have beneficial lipid and metabolic effects and can improve left ventricular hypertrophy, theoretically having a positive impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The only drug interaction identified with the alpha 1 blockers is an increased hypotensive effect when they are combined with other antihypertensive agents. A further advantage of the alpha 1 blockers is that, because of the widespread location of alpha 1 receptors, the agents offer potential benefit for a number of disease states, including benign prostatic hyperplasia. They also provide an especially useful antihypertensive choice for middle-aged and elderly patients.\r"

Anterior segment inflammation, optic neuritis, and late retinal detachment are also common features of this disorder. Definitive evidence now implicates at least two members of the herpes virus family; varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus as causative agents.

The peroxisomal disorders have been divided into three groups: 1) those that result from defective biogenesis of the peroxisome (Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum's disease); 2) those that result from multiple enzyme deficiencies (rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata); and 3) those that result from a single enzyme deficiency (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, primary hyperoxaluria type 1). Zellweger syndrome, the most lethal of the three peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, causes infantile hypotonia, seizures, and death within the first year. Ophthalmic manifestations include corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy and optic atrophy. Neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and infantile Refsum's disease appear to be genetically distinct, but clinically, biochemically, and pathologically similar to Zellweger syndrome, although milder. Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, a peroxisomal disorder which results from at least two peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies, presents at birth with skeletal abnormalities and patients rarely survive past one year of age. The most prominent ocular manifestation consists of bilateral cataracts. X-linked (childhood) adrenoleukodystrophy, results from a deficiency of a single peroxisomal enzyme, presents in the latter part of the first decade with behavioral, cognitive and visual deterioration. The vision loss results from demyelination of the entire visual pathway, but the outer retina is spared. Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 manifests parafoveal subretinal pigment proliferation. Classical Refsum's disease may also be a peroxisomal disorder, but definitive evidence is lacking. Early identification of these disorders, which may depend on recognizing the ophthalmological findings, is critical for prenatal diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counselling.\r"

These drugs have become an important, and often essential, part of the ophthalmologist's armamentarium against inflammatory and immune-mediated ocular diseases. In order to better acquaint the ophthalmologist with the properties of the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs, we review the literature and relate our own experience with these agents.\r"

Also, do not agree to refuse to offer services to alternate delivery systems. Generally, those who serve on peer review committees are protected if decisions are reached after effort has been made to obtain the facts of the case, after adequate notice and fair hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved, and when the action has been warranted by the facts and is in the furtherance of health care. An attorney who specializes in antitrust should be engaged. Members of peer review committees should not be in a position to benefit from the decision. They should document all transgressions of the accused, treat the accused fairly, and give him or her the opportunity to have due process.\r"

The effects of smoking on the pulmonary absorption of inhaled terbutaline were examined in normal subjects. Nine healthy smokers and 13 healthy non-smokers inhaled nebulised terbutaline and dry terbutaline powder on two study days. Plasma concentrations of terbutaline were measured up to 240 minutes after the inhalation. The plasma concentration of terbutaline rose much faster in smokers than in non-smokers, the mean time to peak terbutaline concentration being 17 minutes in the smokers and 50 minutes in the non-smokers. The peak plasma concentration was nearly twice as high in the smokers as in the non-smokers, being 21 mmol/l and 23 mmol/l for the dry powder inhalation and nebuliser respectively in the smokers and 12 mmol/l and 14 mmol/l in the non-smokers. It is concluded that smoking increases the rate of terbutaline absorption and the peak plasma concentration achieved. The rapid pulmonary absorption of terbutaline in smokers may affect the onset of action of the drug and the duration of its therapeutic effects.\r"

Serum circulating immune complexes were increased at the time that infiltrates were present in all patients and the levels returned to normal as patients recovered clinically and radiologically. The Mantoux test response was negative in most patients. Fifty serial sections were obtained from each paraffin embedded biopsy specimen block and every 10th section was stained (step sectioning) with haematoxylin and eosin. Six patients (group 1) did not have eosinophilic infiltration; four of these had granulation tissue plugs within respiratory bronchioles when the tissue was examined by step sectioning. All had organising pneumonia and interstitial inflammation in the setting of a clinical picture consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia. In two cases IgG had been deposited in intraalveolar macrophages. Biopsy specimens in five patients (group 2) showed eosinophilic infiltration; four patients had chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and one the Churg-Strauss syndrome. Step sectioning of transbronchial biopsy specimens in patients with migratory pulmonary infiltrates is useful and may support the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia.\r"

There was no significant change in baseline FEV1 after treatment and cetirizine failed to inhibit exercise induced bronchoconstriction (maximum falls in FEV1 28% and 27% of baseline). In a further eight patients (four male; mean age 40.8 years) the effect of 1 ml cetirizine (5 and 10 mg/ml) given through a Wright nebuliser was compared with that of placebo in a double blind trial. The fall in FEV1 after exercise was reduced after both concentrations of cetirizine by 15.2% of baseline after 5 mg/ml and by 10.2% after 10 mg/ml, compared with 23.7% after placebo. In two patients cetirizine had no effect. In a further study cetirizine (10 mg/ml) given by inhalation displaced the geometric mean PC20 histamine 13.1 fold to the right by comparison with placebo. The reason for the difference between the effects of oral and of inhaled cetirizine on exercise asthma is not clear but may be related to differences in local concentration in the airway.\r"

The distribution of propellant, delivered from a metered dose inhaler, was studied by radiolabelling it with technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime. Andersen sampler measurements indicated that half of the dose was associated with particles in the size range 0.5-5 microns diameter. The preparation was administered to healthy subjects by inhalation and deposition was monitored with a gamma camera. Each lung image was divided into an inner, mid, and peripheral zone. The effects on deposition of varying the size of the delivery orifice (0.46, 0.61, and 0.76 mm internal diameters) and the effect of attaching a spacer were assessed. Lung deposition was independent of the orifice size within the actuator. Without the spacer the average dose deposited in the lungs was 39%, with 15% penetrating into the peripheral part of the lungs. Attachment of the spacer to the mouth-piece increased the mean lung deposition to 57% and reduced oropharyngeal deposition. The study has shown that propellant soluble drugs can be delivered efficiently to the lungs from a metered dose inhaler.\r"

Thirty patients with partially reversible chronic airflow obstruction and a mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 1.2 litres that improved by 25% were included in the study. Patients who developed non-infective exacerbations of airflow obstruction that required additional bronchodilator treatment were classed as \"treatment failures.\" Such treatment failure occurred in 23 patients with placebo, in 22 patients with theophylline, in 12 patients with terbutaline, and in two patients taking the two drugs. Mean daily peak flow readings were highest with the combination of the two drugs, followed by terbutaline and then theophylline, and lowest with placebo. Thus a combination of terbutaline and theophylline was superior to either drug alone; inhaled terbutaline was superior to theophylline alone. Theophylline alone does not appear to have much place in the management of patients with partially reversible obstructive airways disease.\r"

Functional residual capacity and total lung capacity was measured with a body plethysmograph before, during, and immediately after breathing with expiratory pressure of 5 and 15 cm H2O, and after a coughing period. The positive expiratory pressure breathing was carried out five times for two minutes with a two minute interval between each period. Mucus transport was measured in a peripheral lung region and over the whole lung by a radioactive aerosol tracer technique. Clearance measurements were carried out continuously during positive expiratory pressure breathing and during a control period. Two minutes' breathing with an expiratory pressure of 5 and 15 cm H2O caused an increase in mean (SEM) functional residual capacity from 2.6 (0.1) to 3.6 (0.3) and 4.4 (0.5) 1 and an increase in total lung capacity from 5.1 (0.2) to 5.9 (0.3) and 6.9 (0.4) 1. Lung volumes were higher during breathing with an expiratory pressure of 15 cm H2O than with 5 cm H2O; both returned to baseline values immediately after positive expiratory pressure breathing. Spontaneous mucus clearance and mucus clearance by coughing were not influenced by positive expiratory pressure breathing at either expiratory pressure. Thus in patients with cystic fibrosis positive expiratory pressure breathing increases lung volumes in relation to the expiratory pressure imposed; these changes in lung volume did not, however, lead to an improvement of mucus transport.\r"

Although the majority of UTIs in young women are simple and uncomplicated, the rate of recurrence is substantial. Each treatment of UTI recurrence brings greater antibiotic resistance, requiring the use of broader spectrum and more expensive antibiotic therapy. Moreover, infection in patients with underlying urinary tract or systemic diseases can lead to serious medical and financial consequences. A better understanding of antibiotic resistance, particularly in regard to beta-lactamase-producing pathogens, has allowed us to develop more appropriate criteria for selecting antibiotics as well as the duration of therapy. The overall cost for treating UTIs in young women is a substantial health care expenditure, and requires an ongoing examination of new information concerning pathogenesis and available antibiotic therapies.\r"

A total of 54 patients with vasculogenic impotence were administered intracorporeal prostaglandin E1 (20 micrograms) and intracorporeal papaverine (60 mg) randomized in a double-blind fashion and crossed over one week later. Forty-six percent of patients receiving prostaglandin E1 produced a satisfactory erection compared with 14 percent of patients with a similar response to papaverine. The difference between these results was highly significantly by the McNemar test. The number of side effects were similar for both drugs. Prostaglandin E1 might be considered the intracorporeal agent of choice for patients with significant vasculogenic impotence.\r"

The catheter was removed on postoperative day 1 in 66 patients (group I) and on postoperative day 2 in 61 patients (group II). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of population age, weight of resected glands, operative time, and management. Both groups I and II had 8 complications following catheter removal. Postoperative hospital stay was reduced by an average of 1.37 days in group I. Total hospital cost was reduced by approximately $466.00. We conclude that catheter removal on postoperative day 1 is safe with no added morbidity while having the advantage of reduced hospital costs.\r"

As the number of AIDS and ARC patients continues to increase dramatically, urologists will be called upon more frequently to help evaluate these patients for reversible causes of renal failure and to obtain tissue for pathologic diagnosis. Eight patients with ARC and renal failure were recently evaluated. Renal biopsies in 4 patients revealed focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis while 2 others showed proliferative and necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents. The implications of this study are that ARC patients with renal failure should be fully evaluated and be considered for long-term dialysis. However, the results of renal biopsies in these patients are unlikely to affect patient treatment.\r"

Sixty-six of the 114 patients (58%) responded favorably to anticholinergic treatment while 48 patients (42%) did not. Based on urethrocystometry, two groups of patients were identified: Group I consisted of 73 women with bladder contraction that preceded any change in urethral pressure. Group II consisted of 41 patients with urethral pressure drop that preceded the detrusor contraction by a few seconds. Sixty-one of the 73 women (84%) in Group I responded favorably to four weeks of anticholinergic therapy while 88 percent (36 of 41) of women in Group II did not (P less than 0.01). Our results suggest that women with bladder contraction that is preceded by urethral relaxation represent a different pathologic entity than women with \"classic detrusor instability\".\r"

The dynamic images of the varicoceles were classified into two groups: one group with no radionuclide accumulation, and one group with patchy radionuclide accumulations. Surgical treatment was performed in patients with poor semen quality or with a long infertility period. Neither improvement in the semen quality nor impregnation was achieved postoperatively in patients who had shown no accumulation of the radionuclide in the dynamic imaging. In patients who had shown patchy radionuclide accumulations, the postoperative results were good.

The image-processing system demonstrated an excess of connective tissue elements between smooth muscle bundles in the anterior wall of the bladder similar to the results of previous studies dealing with the trabeculated posterior wall. Under electronmicroscopy, myofilaments were shown to be multidirectionally arranged in the smooth muscle cells in contrast to the regular arrangement in controls. Dense areas in the cytoplasm of the detrusor muscle also appeared to be abnormally distorted and/or elongated in the electronmicrographs. In support of these findings, actin- and myosin-like immunoreactivities in the muscle layer of the bladder were significantly less intense than in the controls. These results suggest that chronic obstruction of the lower urinary tract causes histopathologic alterations in both the intervening connective tissue and the detrusor muscle. This study raises the possibility that the aforementioned morphologic abnormalities are involved in the occurrence of uninhibited detrusor contraction and abnormal detrusor reflex in patients with lower urinary tract obstruction.\r"

The furosemide renography was a very constant parameter in the unobstructed kidney (85%) and in the partly obstructed kidney (85%). A type I FR pattern (O'Reilly classification) was an exact indicator of an unobstructed pelvis. After partial ureteral obstruction, an immediate change in the FR pattern was seen either into type II or type IIIa renography.

The age distribution of these patients was between 22 and 84 yr, with a medium age of 49.6 yr. Chromosome 5 was involved in structural rearrangements in 10 of the 18 patients with adenomatous polyps (55.5%). All those who showed involvement of chromosome 5 alterations had either adenomatous polyps or Gardner's syndrome, and two had colon adenocarcinoma. Of the remainder who did not show involvement of chromosome 5, eight had adenomatous polyps and five had hyerplastic polyps (non-neoplastic). Of the 10 control samples, only one showed alteration of chromosome 5. Of the 10 adenomatous polyp subjects that showed chromosome 5 defects, two had translocations of chromosome 5 and the short arm of 17. Chromosome 5 was broken 13 times (5 times in the q arm and 8 times in the p arm). Based on our present cytogenetic data, we tentatively conclude that lymphocyte metaphases may be used to identify colon cancer-predisposed individuals.\r"

Fifteen (35%) had immunoglobulins below the normal range for age, and typified those with transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, because all increased their levels over the following 12 months. The age of those with hypogammaglobulinemia was significantly younger (p less than 0.01), averaging 18.8 months, than those with normal immunoglobulins who had a mean age of 4.6 yr. The number with recurrent C. difficile infection was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) in the hypogammaglobulinemic group than in those with normal immunoglobulins (46% vs 18%). Eleven children were identified who had C. difficile toxin in the stool after antibiotic therapy, but who had no diarrhea at the time of study. All had normal immunoglobulins. Control patients (20 without and 40 with diarrhea) had no evidence of C. difficile infection, and all but three had normal immunoglobulins. Three (7%) of those with diarrhea had IgA deficiency, and all had a diagnosis of milk protein allergy. These data suggest that immunoglobulin values be obtained in infants and children who have problematic C. difficile diarrhea in order to identify disorders of immunoglobulin synthesis which may be the underlying cause of repeated upper respiratory disease requiring antibiotic usage.\r"

UC active patients showed a significant decrease of F.XIII subunit \"a,\" compared with healthy subjects, as well as in UC patients in remission. In contrast, the level of F.XIII subunit \"b\" in each group was similar. Compared with normal subjects, UC active patients revealed a significant decrease in AT III concentration, prolonged ELT, and elevated fibrinogen level. In addition, the elevated titer of SDPS test for SFMC appeared in approximately 40% of those patients. However, no strict relationship was found between the presence of positive SDPS and diminution of AT III, as well as of F.XIIII subunit \"a\" in active UC state. In patients in remission, AT III level and ELT were similar to those as in the control group, but fibrinogen concentration was elevated. Such constellation of hemostatic parameters may indicate a tendency to blood hypercoagulability in UC active patients, whereas, in general, these changes are not associated with the stage of remission. The present data may also suggest that F.XIII behavior pattern should be taken into account in the clinical management of UC.\r"

The mean age of the recipient group was 35 yr (range 24-51) with a mean duration of diabetes of 22 yr (range 13-41). All patients received quadruple immunosuppression with OKT3 induction. All patients remained normoglycemic and insulin independent with a mean glycosylated hemoglobin level of 6.0 +/- 1.1% and a mean serum creatinine of 1.7 +/- 0.5 mg/dl. Metabolic control and hormonal profiles were assessed by intravenous glucose challenge followed by arginine stimulation. Metabolic effects of PT included fasting hyperinsulinemia and hyperglucagonemia with exaggerated insulin and glucagon responses to glucose and arginine, respectively. Patient and graft survival is 100% after a mean follow-up interval of 8 months. Conclusion: combined pancreas-kidney transplantation is a valid treatment option for diabetic nephropathy, and results in near-complete normalization of glucose metabolism.\r"

Available serologic testing (i.e., indirect hemagglutinin antibody) is sensitive and confirms the diagnosis. Most patients respond rapidly and completely to oral metronidazole.

Clinical evidence suggests a decreased sensitivity to norepinephrine in this clinical setting, indicating a potential derangement of alpha 1 adrenoreceptors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reactivity of the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor, using phenylephrine, a selective alpha 1 receptor agonist. First, we evaluated the pupillar response to the intraconjunctival administration of the agonist. Hypotensive cirrhotic patients showed a trend to a more marked and prolonged response, compared with age-matched healthy controls. Second, we studied the response of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors in the peripheral vasculature by administering iv phenylephrine to a similar group of patients. A significantly greater and longer lasting pressor response was observed in hypotensive cirrhotic patients (p less than 0.0001 vs. healthy controls). Our results indicate that in this group of patients, there is a rather peculiar situation, characterized by alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in the presence of high levels of circulating norepinephrine. This finding could be related to biochemical abnormalities within the peripheral sympathetic nervous system endings.\r"

Gastrointestinal tract involvement with KS usually was silent, although present, in every patient with KS who underwent autopsy. Lymphoma was most commonly non-Hodgkin's, and often produced symptoms. Uncommonly, the gastrointestinal tract was the primary site of neoplasms other than KS or lymphoma.\r"

EUS was performed in 11 patients with primary gastric lymphoma who subsequently underwent gastrectomy with lymph node dissection, as well as chemotherapy in some cases. EUS findings showed a good correlation with the histopathology of the resected specimens. An accurate diagnosis of the depth of invasion into the gastric wall was made in 10 of 11 patients using the same T grade of the 1987 TNM system for gastric carcinoma. EUS also clearly visualized the reduction of depth of tumor invasion in two patients who underwent chemotherapy. Perigastric lymph node involvement could be detected accurately in nine of 11 patients. In conclusion, EUS is an excellent and sensitive diagnostic modality for the preoperative staging and follow-up of primary gastric lymphoma.\r"

Two patients in this group showed a positive gastric biopsy after 1 and 2 yr, respectively, of therapy: one patient is under current treatment with laser therapy, and the other patient underwent surgery with resection of the stomach. The second group included four patients in whom treatment was aimed at prolonging survival or palliation, and in all four patients, a successful response was obtained. Therefore, our results demonstrate that endoscopic therapy is effective for the treatment of gastric cancer patients over 80 yr old.\r"

  ".W": "The gastroduodenal mucus layer is considered the primary mucosal protective barrier, especially important in the maintenance of a mucosal pH gradient. Thus, the measurement of the mucus layer thickness in various disease states could advance our understanding of gastroduodenal pathophysiology. We present a novel method for measuring the mucus layer in endoscopic biopsy material and compare layer thickness in Helicobacter pylori (HP)-negative and HP-positive specimens. Endoscopic biopsies were obtained from 17 patients with gastroduodenal mucosa harboring HP and from 15 patients without current HP colonization. The thickness of the mucus layer was measured in fresh specimens by the phase-contrast dark-field microscopy technique. In patients with confirmed HP infection, the thickness of the mucus layer (mean +/- SD) was 0.093 +/- 0.033 mm in duodenal, 0.085 +/- 0.027 mm in antral, and 0.105 +/- 0.033 mm in corporal mucosa. In patients without concomitant HP colonization, the thickness of the mucus gel was 0.162 +/- 0.045 mm, 0.175 +/- 0.067 mm, and 0.161 +/- 0.064 mm in duodenum, antrum, and corpus, respectively. The differences between the means were statistically significant (p less than 0.001 for the duodenal, p less than 0.001 for antral, and p less than 0.01 for corporal mucosa). This study suggests that colonization of the gastroduodenal mucosa by HP impairs the mucus layer covering the surface epithelium. This mucus layer impairment may lead to mucosal injury with subsequent development of inflammation and, possibly, peptic ulcer disease.\r"

We evaluated the severity of acute mucosal injury and H. pylori status in 61 normal volunteers (ages 22-43 yr) receiving naproxen (1000 mg, n = 30) or aspirin (3900 mg, n = 31) daily for 7 days. NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal mucosa each were endoscopically graded separately for hemorrhages and erosions-ulcers on a scale of 0 to 4. H. pylori infection was identified by a sensitive and specific ELISA. Nine of the 30 subjects in the naproxen group and 12 of the 31 subjects in the aspirin group were H. pylori positive (p = NS). There was no statistically significant difference between the frequency of mucosal hemorrhage in those with and those without H. pylori infection (44% compared with 33% for those receiving naproxen and 90% of those receiving ASA, p = NS for each). There were also no differences in the frequency or severity of erosive mucosal injury seen, e.g., acute ulcers were found in 16.5% and 17.5% of infected and uninfected subjects, respectively. We conclude that the presence of H. pylori infection does not influence the degree or type of mucosal damage associated with the acute administration of naproxen or aspirin.\r"

To determine whether delayed gastric emptying plays a role in the genesis of GER, we correlated gastric-emptying measures obtained by scintigraphic techniques with the degree of acid reflux assessed by esophageal pH monitoring. Ten patients, all of whom had evidence of esophageal mucosal disease and severe acid reflux, were studied. Four of the 10 patients with reflux had prolongation in the lag phase of gastric solid emptying, and one of the four showed prolonged gastric-emptying t1/2. There was no significant difference, however, in the mean gastric-emptying t1/2 between a control group and the patient group. Furthermore, there was no correlation between gastric-emptying measures and degree of acid reflux. We conclude that in this group of 10 patients with severe GER, delayed gastric emptying does not play an important role in the development of gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

Nine normal subjects were used as controls. Antroduodenal motility was recorded by means of manometry for 200-300 min after an overnight fast and the gastric emptying (T1/2) of a semisolid meal was measured utilizing a scintigraphic method. Patients of group S showed a significantly lower incidence of migrating motor complex activity fronts, as well as a more delayed gastric emptying, compared with those of group M. The reason that patients with the same degree of esophageal motor impairment have different degrees of GER may lie in the fact that the concomitant impairment of gastrointestinal interdigestive cyclic clearing activity and the delay in gastric emptying may allow a larger quantity of material to remain stagnant in the gastric lumen, readily available for gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

  ".W": "Esophageal tuberculosis is rare, with only 26 cases previously reported in the literature. Patients usually present with progressive dysphagia or odynophagia. We report a patient with hematemesis that was later attributed to the erosion of tuberculous subcarinal lymph nodes into the esophagus. This presentation has been described in only two other patients, both of whom died of exsanguinating hemorrhage. The successful outcome in the present case rested on the availability of rapid diagnostic modalities and timely surgical intervention.\r"

Herein we report four cases of isolated proximal duodenal tuberculosis, without involvement of other parts of the GI tract. The clinical presentation in three of them resembled that of peptic ulcer disease, and one had features of gastric outlet obstruction. On investigation, one of these patients had a pyeloduodenal fistula. The limitations of clinical evaluation, radiology, and endoscopy are stressed, and the value of surgical biopsy is highlighted.\r"

The first patient presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and mass in the head of the pancreas, on computerized tomographic (CT) scan. The second patient presented with low grade fever, anorexia, and weight loss, and was investigated for gallbladder disease. The third patient presented with obstructive jaundice and mass lesion in the head of the pancreas. Two patients underwent laparotomy for suspected pancreatic tumors. The findings of pancreatic disease was incidental during laparotomy in the second patient. The histopathology revealed caseating granuloma in all of them. The first patient responded well to treatment, and the second patient stopped treatment after 2 months and is well. The third patient is being followed. If malignancy can be ruled out, tuberculosis should be considered in relevant geographic areas, and a tissue diagnosis should be made.\r"
