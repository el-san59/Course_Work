  ".W": "Modern extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy can be performed with combined ECG and respiratory triggered shock wave release. Disconnecting the ECG triggering increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including potentially malignant ones. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of any sympatho-adrenal excitation as a possible explanation for the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia. Plasma catecholamine levels were assessed in 5 patients during and after 50 min of anaesthesia-free extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for the treatment of calculi in the upper pole of the left kidney. Venous blood sampling showed no significant increase in catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine) during or after treatment. The heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured simultaneously and showed no significant increase when shock waves were released during ECG triggering. However, when disconnecting the ECG-triggering mode, the incidence of ventricular extrasystoles on Holter monitoring became more apparent during respiratory triggered shock wave release only, although there was no rise in plasma catecholamine levels. These data suggest that cardiac arrhythmias are related to direct and accidental mechanical stimulation of the heart rather than to any sympatho-adrenal discharge during shock wave release.\r"

Patients with mild incontinence benefited from intensified training, since 72% could expect to be cured, while patients with severe incontinence and no immediate effect did not benefit from further exercises. Patients with a positive hormone status and those with normal weight had a significantly higher cure rate. The subjective results were confirmed by the 24-h pad test. Anal pressure profilometry was a valid method for instruction and objective control of pelvic floor function. It was concluded that pelvic floor exercises should precede surgery, since exercises had a permanent effect in half of the patients.\r"

Surgery had no statistically significant effect on any urodynamic parameter and post-operative complications were common. The operation was performed in either the coronal (19) or the sagittal plane (26); this did not influence results. In general, surgery was found to be technically simpler in the sagittal group and it is recommended that this becomes the standard procedure. We feel that this operation involves major surgery and should only be offered with reluctance.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo labelling of urological tumour cells using the S phase marker bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) for histochemical studies is reported. The use of multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) with BRdU labelling to study tumour proliferation offers significant advantages. It provides simultaneous measurements of the DNA ploidy (DI), the duration of the S phase (Ts), the potential doubling time (Tpot) and the total and aneuploid tumour labelling indices (LI) from a single specimen. Heterogenous tumour cell populations can be measured with high sensitivity. We report a preliminary study to evaluate the method in the measurement of the kinetics of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCCB). Nineteen patients with TCCB, 1 with leukoplakia of the bladder, 2 with renal carcinoma, 1 with prostatic carcinoma and 1 with a squamous carcinoma of the penis were studied. Of the bladder tumours, 3 were aneuploid, DI = 1.32, 1.58 and 1.89. BRdU uptake was detected in all tumours. The median LI was 1.5% (range 0.5-10.0). In 15/19 tumours the labelling profile was satisfactory for calculation of the Ts and Tpot. The median Ts was 6.2 h and the median Tpot was 17.1 days. This study demonstrates that measurement of multiple parameters of urological tumour proliferation in vivo is possible. These parameters require further assessment as indices of biological aggressiveness and clinical prognosis.\r"

The greatest density of nerve fibres was found in the proximal central prostate, followed by the anterior capsule and distal central prostate, with the least in the peripheral prostate. The greatest number of nerve fibres contained ACh and NPY, followed in decreasing order by VIP and DBH; IENK, serotonin and CGRP; mENK; substance P and somatostatin. The functions of the neurotransmitter substances in the human prostate remain to be elucidated.\r"

Approximately 60% of the patients required hospitalisation for additional treatment and investigation of complications due to their disease at the time of orchiectomy. In 51 cases the orchiectomy was combined with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP); 37 patients had pathological levels of serum creatinine and 17 had pathological dilatation of the upper urinary tract, 6 of whom required a nephrostomy catheter. Because of anaemia on admission, 21 patients received a peri-operative blood transfusion. Two patients had significant post-operative bleeding, 2 developed a wound infection and 1 had a deep thrombophlebitis. The patients' mean age was 76.4 years and the period of hospitalisation ranged from 3 to 150 days with peaks at 3 and 8 days. The most important reason for prolonged hospitalisation was social problems. It was concluded that many patients who were hospitalised as a direct consequence of their prostatic carcinoma would have been in hospital for a similar period regardless of the method of hormonal manipulation used. Because so many patients have other reasons for hospitalisation, or require additional surgical procedures such as TURP, the true average cost of orchiectomy for advanced prostatic cancer is difficult to determine.\r"

The treatment was discontinued because of side effects in 3 of 51 evaluable MPA-treated patients and in 8 of 51 evaluable estramustine-treated patients. Progression-free survival was short in both groups and no statistically significant difference between them was observed. After 1 year, 70% of the patients had died and there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatments in the cumulative observed survival rates. According to modified SPCG criteria, remissions lasting from 12 to 56 weeks were noted in 13 MPA-treated patients and in 4 estramustine-treated patients. This difference was statistically significant. After cross-over, 6 of 33 patients in the MPA group had a remission compared with 1 of 24 in the estramustine group.

Eroded surfaces in tumour-free specimens were high in patients with active compared to stable disease but bone volume was maintained in both groups, whilst in bone surrounding micrometastases (n = 8) eroded surfaces were further increased and bone volume reduced. Eroded surfaces within metastases were greater still but were associated with increased bone volume due to replacement of the existing trabecular tissue with abnormal woven bone, giving an overall appearance of sclerosis. These results show that the effect of prostate cancer on bone tissue is complex, involving differential disturbance of bone formation and resorption within metastases, in bone surrounding tumour invasion and in the tumour-free skeleton.\r"

The present prospective study was to determine the influence of previous radiotherapy, widely used in the management of this tumour, on the accuracy of endosonography. A complete endosonographic examination was performed just before surgery in 40 patients with rectal cancer. Endosonographic and pathological staging were compared in group A, 21 patients without previous radiotherapy, and group B, 19 patients with preoperative radiotherapy. While the endosonographic accuracy for lymph node involvement was similar in the two groups (85 per cent compared with 84 per cent), wall invasion was correctly ascertained in 86 per cent in group A but in only 47 per cent in group B (P less than 0.05). After irradiation, the thickening of the rectal wall and the poor visualization of the hyperechoic layers hampered interpretation. Post-radiotherapy inflammation and/or fibrosis probably explained the echographic changes. Radiotherapy therefore altered endosonographic staging of rectal cancer. New interpretation criteria are needed for evaluation and follow-up of rectal cancer treated by radiotherapy.\r"

There was little difference in bowel function; after IRA median frequency was 3/24 h and urgency (unable to wait 15 min) occurred in 50 per cent, compared with 4.5/24h and 17 per cent after RPC. Night evacuation occurred in 10 and 43 per cent respectively. IRA was performed in younger patients (median 19 versus 31 years) who had fewer bowel motions before operation (2 versus 5/24 h). The greater morbidity of RPC suggests that it should be restricted to patients at higher risk of developing later rectal cancer, including those unavailable for follow-up and those with large or confluent rectal polyps or with curable colon cancer at the initial colectomy.\r"

  ".U": "91338988\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer underwent 'radical' liver resection from 1980 to 1989. At least 1 cm of normal parenchyma surrounded the tumour and no microscopic invasion of resection margins was evident. The disease was staged according to our own staging system. Lobectomy was performed in 50 patients and non-anatomical resection in the remainder. The postoperative mortality rate was 5 per cent and the major morbidity rate was 11 per cent. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients in stages I, II and III was 42 per cent, 34 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (P less than 0.001). The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 30 per cent. The prognostic importance of various patient and tumour variables was evaluated by univariate analysis and then by multivariate analysis. Age of patient, site of primary, disease-free interval between treatment of primary and of hepatic metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and number of metastases, did not relate to prognosis, while sex (P = 0.024), stage of primary (P = 0.026), extent of liver involvement (P less than 0.001), distribution of metastases (P = 0.01) and type of surgery (P = 0.028) significantly affected prognosis as single factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the extent of liver involvement and stage of the primary tumour were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that liver resection is effective in selected patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In resectable patients it is not yet possible to formulate a clear prognosis based on clinical factors. The extent of liver involvement and the staging system used may be significant, although not absolute, indicators of outcome.\r"

Recently a new technique has been described that allows safe transplantation with a donor:recipient weight ratio of greater than 10:1. This should greatly increase the paediatric donor pool. Anatomical landmarks and techniques necessary for donor reduction hepatectomy are described from the dissection of 50 adult cadaveric livers. Variations in all important biliary and vascular structures necessitated adjustments in operative technique.\r"

Sixty-two patients (mean age 75 years, range 27-95 years) with retained common bile duct stones were treated with two different lithotriptors. One of the lithotriptors operated on the electrohydraulic principle (Dornier HM-3) (n = 13), the other on the electromagnetic principle (Siemens Lithostar) (n = 49). All HM-3 patients were treated under general anaesthesia, whereas with the Lithostar one patients was treated under general anaesthesia, 43 received analgesia and sedation and five had no analgesia at all. Patients treated with the Lithostar had more sessions (mean 1.9 versus 1.3, P less than 0.05) and needed more stock waves (mean 8611 versus 2534, P less than 0.001) than patients treated with the HM-3. Fragmentation was achieved in all patients treated with the HM-3 and in 42 (86 per cent) patients treated with the Lithostar. In this latter group ten patients underwent common bile duct exploration without complications. Eleven patients had transient haematuria after treatment with the HM-3 and two patients (one in each group) had a subcapsular haematoma of the right kidney, all without clinical sequelae. At follow-up (median: HM-3 43 months, Lithostar 18 months), none of the patients had biliary complaints. We conclude that ESWL of retained common bile duct stones in safe and effective with both lithotriptors and should be considered before surgery in the elderly or high-risk patient.\r"

The 5-year survival rate was only 73.2 per cent in the 34 patients with lymph node metastases (31.8 per cent). Analysis of factors influencing recurrence revealed that not only lymph node metastases but also the depth of cancer invasion could affect prognosis in early gastric cancer. This study suggests that radical operation with complete dissection of the first and second group of lymph nodes (R2 resection) is a safe and appropriate treatment even for early gastric cancer. We propose that the definition of early gastric cancer be modified to 'carcinoma with invasion confined to the mucosa or submucosa and without evidence of lymph node metastases'.\r"

In 36 cases curatively resected, 32 had completion total gastrectomy and four had subtotal resection. An R1 resection was performed in 11 patients and an R2 in 25. We had two hospital deaths and a 5-year survival rate excluding hospital deaths of 39 per cent. The 5-year survival rates of resected cases, curative cases and those having metastatic nodes were 43 per cent, 57 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Radical resection is a reasonable treatment for gastric stump cancer as it is for primary cancer of the stomach.\r"

In stations 1-11 (corresponding with R2 resection) an average of 27 nodes (range 17-44 nodes) was found, whereas stations 1-16 (corresponding with R3 resection) showed an average of 43 nodes (range 25-64 nodes). These values are higher than those usually obtained from lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. Striking individual differences in the total number of lymph nodes and the number of single stations was observed. The number of lymph nodes in these investigations are the normal anatomical values and serve as quality control of lymph node dissection in gastric carcinoma.\r"

Thirty were benign (16 phaeochromocytomas, six adrenocortical adenomas, four adrenal cysts, two myelolipomas, an adrenal hematoma and a ganglioneuroma). Of 15 malignant masses, there were seven adrenocortical carcinomas, five adrenal metastases and three adrenal lymphomas. With the exception of the adrenal myelolipomas, cysts, and the ganglioneuroma neither CT nor MRI demonstrated sufficient diagnostic specificity to distinguish benign from malignant lesions. Functional scintigraphy with 131I-6-beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol for suspected adrenocortical lesions and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine for suspected phaeochromocytomas frequently provided useful information.\r"

The mortality rate during the initial admission was 10 per cent, all seven deaths being unavoidable in infants in group C with multiple anomalies. Birthweight alone had no bearing upon the chances of survival. Primary oesophageal repair, including one suture-fistula procedure and one delayed primary repair, was attempted in 54 (84 per cent) of the 64 patients with atresia and was successful in 46 (85 per cent). All three H-type tracheo-oesophageal fistulae were successfully divided in infants in group A. Recurrent tracheo-oesophageal fistula developed in four (7 per cent) infants, one of whom (group A) underwent successful repair. One disrupted anastomosis was successfully resutured (group A), so an intact oesophagus was finally achieved in 51 patients, of whom six (12 per cent) developed anastomotic strictures and 21 (41 per cent) underwent surgery for gastro-oesophageal reflux. Of the 60 early survivors, 10 (17 per cent) underwent aortopexy for tracheomalacia. Whenever possible, primary repair is advocated in all infants. Even for those in group C with multiple, severe associated anomalies, the combined early and late mortality was no greater following primary repair (7 died of 12 operated) than after staged repair (4 died of 7 operated), but major anastomotic complications were more common in infants in group C (5 out of 19) than in those in groups A and B (3 out of 38).\r"

The optimum formulation of these glues measured by their effect on mechanical properties of healing wounds has not been determined.

Calcium (40 mumol/ml) and aprotinin (3000 kallidinogenase inactivator units, KIu/ml) concentrations were kept constant. Animals were killed at 8 days and wounds excised. Standard strips of these wounds were mechanically tested using an Instron tensiometer and the stress, strain, elasticity and work required to rupture wounds were calculated. Results indicate that a fibrin glue with a fibrinogen concentration of approximately 39 g/l and a thrombin concentration of 200-600 units/ml with no added factor XIII will result in wounds with significantly increased stress, energy absorption and elasticity values.\r"

The relationship between tumour ploidy and disease outcome was assessed and its association with other prognostic factors evaluated. Compared with those with diploid tumours, patients with aneuploid tumours had significantly earlier relapse and shorter survival (P less than 0.0001). Tumour ploidy was strongly related to grade (P less than 0.001), but there was no significant association between DNA ploidy and c-erb-B-2 expression, lymph node status or tumour size. In lymph node negative and c-erb-B-2 negative patients, aneuploid tumours were associated with a poorer prognosis (P less than 0.001) than diploid tumours. Multivariate analysis showed that tumour ploidy gave independent information on disease free and overall survival. Tumour ploidy may be used as an independent prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer and it may be helpful in defining patients within the node negative or c-erb-B-2 negative groups likely to have a poor outcome who might benefit from adjuvant treatment.\r"

The analysis included a comparison with the earlier analysed and reported time period from 1951 to 1980. A continued high frequency of pulmonary embolism at autopsy was seen during the 1980s (20.3 per cent of deaths, 31.7 per cent of autopsies). Of the 391 autopsy-verified pulmonary emboli found between 1981 and 1988, 113 (28.9 per cent) were considered fatal, 104 (26.6 per cent) contributed to death and 174 (44.5 per cent) were incidental. Few patients had symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism before death. The overall frequency of major pulmonary embolism in surgical patients remained unchanged (0.3 per cent). The frequency of major postoperative pulmonary embolism showed an increase during the 1950s and 1960s (maximum 0.4 per cent) but a decrease in the last 5-year period of the 1970s (0.3 per cent), which has earlier been reported upon. This decrease continued during the 1980s (0.2 per cent) (P less than 0.05). An increase was found in the number of patients operated on who had autopsy-proven pulmonary embolism and who received thromboprophylaxis. Pulmonary embolism continues to be a major cause of death in surgical patients; however, postoperative major pulmonary embolism has shown a reduction in the last 15-year period.\r"

The euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) of blood from the arms and legs of those with healed ulcers was prolonged; venous congestion significantly shortened the ECLT of blood from all limbs except legs with healed ulcers. The clearance of interstitial fibrin of both legs and arms correlated with the response of the ECLT to venous congestion (P less than 0.05). The clearance of interstitial 125I-labelled albumin in five patients with healed ulcers was faster from the legs than from the arms, whereas the clearance of interstitial 125I-labelled fibrin was faster from the arms in all cases. These results suggest that there is a defect in interstitial fibrinolytic activity as well as vein wall production of plasminogen activator in legs with chronic venous insufficiency.\r"

Data were obtained from a computerized register which covers all instances of inpatient care for a population of 1.3 million. Analysis based on 5394 first admissions for acute arterial occlusion revealed that the annual number increased by 2.7 per cent yearly in women and 3.9 per cent in men whereas the age-adjusted incidence remained stable for women and increased by 2.6 per cent yearly for men. A study of 1189 patients who underwent surgical procedures showed that the annual number of embolectomy procedures increased 7.6 per cent for females and 8.6 per cent for males. The corresponding age-adjusted incidence rose annually by 3.0 per cent for women and by 7.5 per cent for men. The introduction of the Fogarty catheter and an increasing interest in vascular surgery may have contributed to the increasing rates of operations during the period of study.\r"

Thirty-seven patients (33 per cent) died during the study period. Myocardial infarction (44 per cent) and cerebrovascular disease (28 per cent) were the most common causes of death. Overall mortality rate was 8, 23 and 40 per cent, at 2, 5 and 8 years respectively. Initial ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) correlated with subsequent death. With an initial ABPI less than 0.5 death occurred in 20, 50 and 69 per cent at 2, 5 and 7 years respectively, compared with 5, 16 and 24 per cent respectively for those with an initial ABPI greater than or equal to 0.5 (P less than 0.0001). Of the survivors only 21 per cent had worsening claudication and 13 per cent progressed to critical ischaemia. Arterial bypass for limb salvage was required in eight patients and four limbs were lost during the study period. ABPI identifies a subgroup of claudicants with an extremely high risk of death from coronary and/or cerebral pathology. In this subgroup an aggressive approach to the correction of atherosclerotic risk factors, rather than emphasis on the peripheral vascular problem alone, may improve survival.\r"

Forty-four limbs had post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. In 24 (28 per cent) these extended into the femoral vein, while in 20 (24 per cent) only the calf veins were involved. In the 41 limbs (48 per cent) with normal deep veins on ascending phlebography, 11 had evidence of localized incompetence of the calf communicating veins, 14 had either long saphenous incompetence, deep vein reflux to the level of the knee or below, or both of these abnormalities, and 16 limbs had no phlebographic abnormalities. However all limbs had a decreased half volume refilling time on foot volume plethysmography. Limbs with post-thrombotic changes extending into the femoral vein were associated with a significantly longer history of ulceration and more ulcer recurrences than limbs with calf vein damage (P less than 0.05 for each) and limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01 for each). However, these limbs did not have lower transcutaneous oxygen ratios or longer times to achieve ulcer healing. Ascending phlebography identified a group of limbs with extensive post-thrombotic changes in which there was a higher incidence of ulcer breakdown, but this was not associated with a delay in ulcer healing.\r"

We have investigated the effect of different blood flow rates on immediately seeded grafts (SHORT) and also on preformed confluent monolayers formed by overnight incubation (LONG). Cells were labelled with indium and then exposed to either 100 or 200 ml/min of pulsatile blood flow. Cell retention was measured up to 120 min. At both flow rates the LONG seeding procedure gave significantly better cell retention than the SHORT method (P less than 0.01 at all times). There was no difference in cell retention between the two flow rates in the LONG group, but more cells detached at the higher flow rate in the SHORT group (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the new seeding method, using preformed confluent monolayers, significantly improves cell retention during blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether manual stripping of pus from the breasts of women with lactational mastitis is effective in preventing the formation of breast abscesses. DESIGN: Case series (chart review). SETTING: Family practice in Montreal. PATIENTS: All (475) charts of patients with lactational mastitis were reviewed; 61 women were excluded because they already had a breast abscess. Most of the patients had been referred. OUTCOME MEASURES: Abscess formation, length of illness after treatment, rate of recurrence of mastitis, illness in the mother or infant within the 6 weeks after the mastitis and continuance of breast-feeding. MAIN RESULTS: The duration of symptoms before treatment was 1 to 56 (mean 5.3) days. In 9% of the cases both breasts were affected, and in 23% at least one episode of mastitis had previously occurred. The stripping technique was applied to all the patients. Pus was removed in 210 women; the remaining women were considered to have cellulitis. Only four patients (less than 1%) had breast abscesses. The mean length of illness after treatment was 7.2 days. The rate of recurrence was 14%. In all, 6% of the mothers and 9% of the infants became ill in the 6 weeks after the mastitis. Most (92%) of the patients continued to breast-feed. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of abscess formation was considerably lower than the rates reported in the literature. Therefore, manual stripping of pus from the infected breasts of lactating women appears to be effective in preventing breast abscesses.\r"

DESIGN: Descriptive study with a before-after design. SETTING: A home for the aged providing residential care to women. PARTICIPANTS: All 119 residents (ages 71 to 103 years, mean age 87.5 years). INTERVENTION: Introduction of a comprehensive health care directive and follow-up at 1 year. OUTCOME MEASURES: Residents' treatment choices, compliance with the directive, number of hospital admissions and length of hospital stay, number of deaths and places where deaths occurred. RESULTS: Ninety (76%) of the residents completed the directive. In the event of reversible life-threatening illness 34, 24, 11 and 21 residents requested supportive, limited, maximum and intensive care respectively. For irreversible illness the numbers were 75, 12, 3 and 0 respectively. In case of cardiac arrest 88% requested that cardiopulmonary resuscitation not be done. In the year before the introduction of the directive there were nine deaths, one in the home and eight in hospitals. In the year after there were 17 deaths, 11 in the home and 6 in hospitals. The mean length of hospital stay was significantly lower in that year than in the year before implementation (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This innovative health care directive seems to be feasible, practical and well supported by residents, their families and health care professionals. Further studies are required to establish the generalizability and reproducibility of the data to other elderly people in institutions, to chronically ill patients and to the community at large.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1976 a clinical trial has been conducted to test the feasibility, the potential, and to develop methods for using the neutron-emitting radioactive isotope, californium-252 (Cf-252), for the treatment of cervical cancer. A total of 218 patients were treated in the initial study period from 1976 until 1983. The trials initially treated advanced (Stages III and IV) cervical cancer patients using different doses and schedules; they were extended to include unfavorable presentations of Stages I and II because of favorable results in the initial trials. The authors began to treat patients with Stage IB bulky or barrel-shaped tumors and the majority were treated with both radiation and hysterectomy. Actuarial survival was determined for Stage IB disease and was 87% at 5 years and 82% at 10 years. For those tested with preoperative radiation it was 92% at 5 and 87% at 10 years. For Stage II, it was 62% 5 years and 61% at 10. Survival 5 years after combined radiation and surgical therapy for Stage II disease was 68%. For Stage III, it was 33% at 5 years and 25% at 10. However, 5-year survival using the early neutron implant was 46% versus approximately 19% for delayed Cf-252 or cesium 137. Different schedules and sequences of neutrons and photons greatly altered outcome. Neutron treatment before external photon therapy was better for all stages of disease. Only about 5% of all patients developed complications after neutron therapy. No hematologic or mesenchymal second tumors were observed. Neutron brachytherapy was found to be very effective for producing rapid response and greatly improved local control of bulky, barrel, or advanced cervical cancers. The clinical trial identified and evolved schedules, doses, doses per session, and developed methods different from standard photon therapy but highly effective for local control and cure of cervical cancers of all stages. Clinical and radiobiologic understanding for the use of neutron therapy was greatly advanced by this trial. Future trials will focus on patients with advanced disease and will require evaluation of adjuvant chemotherapy studies and neutron-enhancing chemicals.\r"

There were 17 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and one with biphenotypic leukemia. In this series of 24 patients whose disease had relapsed and who had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, nine had a complete remission, seven with AML and two with ALL. In addition, four of six with newly diagnosed acute leukemia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction also responded. Among nine patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy, none had morphologic changes of sufficient degree to account for drug-induced heart failure. Patients with preexisting arrhythmias received amsacrine without incident if their serum potassium level was higher than 4.0 mEq/l at the time of drug administration.

  ".W": "In a pilot study, 32 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia were treated with intensive chemotherapy induction followed by interferon-alpha (IFN-A) maintenance. Intensive chemotherapy consisted of three cycles of daunorubicin 120 mg/m2 on day 1, cytarabine 80 mg/m2 daily for 10 days, vincristine 2 mg on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg daily for 5 days (DOAP). Maintenance therapy with IFN-A at a doses of 3 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) units/m2 daily was adjusted according to counts and toxicity. The outcome of patients was compared with a matched historic population of 64 patients treated with IFN-A alone. Overall, 60% of patients had a cytogenetic response (partial or complete) with induction chemotherapy, but only eight (25%) had a sustained cytogenetic response with IFN-A maintenance. After a median follow-up of 67 months, the 6-year survival rate of the 32 patients was 58%, compared with 36% for the matched historic group (P = 0.084). The incidence of lymphoid blastic transformation in the two groups was 25% and 48%, respectively (P = 0.10) and durable cytogenetic responses, 25% and 19%, respectively (P = 0.48). In summary, the addition of intensive chemotherapy induction to IFN-A maintenance does not improve the survival rate, incidence of lymphoid blastic transformation, or incidence of durable cytogenetic response compared with the results achieved with IFN-A therapy alone.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-four consecutive patients with Stage I or II Hodgkin's disease who presented supradiaphragmatically were treated with radiation therapy alone at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology from January 1978 through December 1986. Fifty-two patients (55%) were staged pathologically, and 42 (45%) were staged clinically. The latter included lymphangiography and/or abdominal computed tomographic scan. Most patients with B symptoms and/or bulky disease were excluded from this series. Seventy-four patients were treated with subtotal nodal irradiation (mantle and periaortic fields). The spleen was treated if the patient had not undergone splenectomy. Twenty patients received mantle irradiation only. No patient received total nodal irradiation. All patients had an initial complete response. With a minimum follow-up of 7 months (median, 7.7 years; seven patients died before 3 years of follow-up, but all other patients had at least 3 years of follow-up), 81 patients (86%) remained disease-free. Six of 52 (12%) of the pathologically staged group had a relapse, as did seven of 42 (17%) of the clinically staged group (P = 0.68). Eight of 57 Stage I patients versus five of 37 Stage II patients had a relapse (P greater than 0.99). Analysis of disease-free survival by age, histologic findings, sex, and sites of involvement did not predict relapse. The pelvis was the most common site of failure (nine patients, 10%). However, only three patients (3%) failed in the pelvis alone. These results indicate that patients who, after adequate clinical staging with selective use of staging laparotomy, are found to have Stage I and II Hodgkin's disease may be treated with subtotal nodal irradiation with a high rate of cure.\r"

At the completion of induction chemotherapy, all patients were assessed for resectability. Those patients judged to be resectable underwent thoracotomy. All remaining patients received thoracic radiation therapy (5500 cGy) followed by additional chemotherapy in those patients responding to neoadjuvant treatment. There were 15 partial responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for an overall response rate of 54% (95% confidence interval, 36% to 71%). Only five partially responding patients (18%) were thought to have had sufficient tumor regression to allow for a potentially curative resection. However, a complete resection was done in only two patients. Overall median survival was 12 months (range, 4 to 72 months) with 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates of 54%, 39%, and 11%, respectively. The primary toxicity associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was moderate to severe (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Grade 3 or 4) nausea and emesis in 25% of patients. Hematologic toxicity was relatively modest; only one patient had Grade 4 leukopenia (less than 1000/microliter). Fever and neutropenia were uncommon, and there were no documented septic episodes or treatment-related deaths. Compared with historic controls treated with radiation therapy alone, cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy appeared to improve the median and long-term survival of Stage III NSCLC patients modestly.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare the cardiotoxic and therapeutic effects of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks) administered by bolus or 72-hour continuous infusion as adjuvant chemotherapy in 82 eligible patients after resection of high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or superficial trunk. Cardiac toxicity, defined as a 10% or greater decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction as assessed by radionuclide cineangiography, was evaluated in 69 patients. Cardiotoxicity was seen in 61% of patients in the bolus treatment arm with the median doxorubicin dose of 420 mg/m2. Among patients who received continuous infusion, 42% had cardiotoxicity with a median dose of 540 mg/m2. The rate of cardiotoxicity as a function of the cumulative dose of doxorubicin was significantly higher in the bolus treatment arm (P = 0.0017). Two patients in each group had clinical congestive heart failure, with one cardiac death occurring in each. There was a trend toward a lower rate of metastasis (P = 0.19) and a significantly lower rate of death of disease (P = 0.036) for patients treated with the bolus dose. Cox model analysis identified three unfavorable characteristics for the rate of developing a distant metastasis: blood transfusion within 24 hours of operation (P less than 0.00001), tumor deep to the fascia and 5 cm or more in size (P = 0.0043), and a histologic subtype other than liposarcoma (P = 0.0002). The unfavorable effect of continuous infusion was not selected in the model (P = 0.16). Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with soft tissue sarcoma is investigational. Furthermore, the impact of perioperative blood transfusion merits further study.\r"

  ".U": "91339097\r", 
  ".W": "Cisplatin and dacarbazine are used widely in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. To evaluate high-dose cisplatin and dacarbazine, 32 patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 and dacarbazine 350 mg/m2 daily for three days repeated at 28-day intervals. Their median age was 43.5 years (range, 25 to 73 years), and their median Karnofsky performance status was 80% (range, 70% to 100%). Measurable and evaluable disease sites (number of patients) included lymph nodes (22), lung (17), soft tissue (16), liver (13), bone (seven), spleen (four), adrenal gland (three), skin (three), and other sites (five). Patients received a median of two cycles of therapy (range, one to eight cycles). Thirty patients were evaluable for response. No complete responses were observed. Five patients had a partial response (17%; 95% confidence interval, 3% to 30%) for 16+, 12+, 7, 6.5, and 3 months. Responding sites of disease included lymph nodes (five of 22), lung (three of 17), and soft tissue (two of 16). Hematologic toxicity (Grade greater than or equal to 3) included neutropenia (16 of 32 patients, 30 of 90 cycles), thrombocytopenia (eight of 32 patients, 12 of 90 cycles), and anemia (five patients). Nine episodes of neutropenia and fever were seen in four patients; two had bacteremia. Nonhematologic toxicity (Grade greater than or equal to 3) included hypotension (two patients), nausea and vomiting (four), neuropathy (two), ototoxicity (four), and hypomagnesemia (nine). The low objective response rate and severe toxicity of this regimen preclude its standard use in patients with metastatic melanoma. A review of cisplatin-based therapy in metastatic melanoma suggests that there is no dose-response relationship. The use of high-dose cisplatin (greater than 100 mg/m2) in the treatment of metastatic melanoma is not recommended.\r"

Before the first course of chemotherapy, the patients received a loading dose of tamoxifen (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days), followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg orally twice a day and continued throughout the treatment. Aspirin (325 mg orally every other day) was administered at the same time as the tamoxifen in an attempt to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. The activity of high-dose cisplatin with dacarbazine and tamoxifen was disappointing. Of 23 evaluable patients, only three responded--an overall response rate of 13% (95% confidence limits, 0% to 27%). These responses consisted of one pathologic complete remission in a patient with nodal metastases, one clinical complete remission in a patient with a very large pelvic mass, and one partial response in another patient with nodal metastases. The duration of responses was 12+, 4, and 4 months, respectively. These data do not support a significant interaction between tamoxifen and cisplatin or dacarbazine. Assuming that tamoxifen is important in the cisplatin, dacarbazine, and carmustine combination, as suggested by others, the most relevant interaction may be between tamoxifen and carmustine.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-eight patients with refractory advanced malignancies were treated with a 24-hour infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid (PALA) weekly. Twenty-seven patients were evaluable to assess toxicity and antitumor activity. The PALA was administered as an intravenous bolus over 15 minutes at a fixed dose (250 mg/m2) 24 hours before the start of the 5-FU and leucovorin infusions. Initially the dose of 5-FU was 750 mg/m2; this was increased incrementally to 2600 mg/m2. The LV was administered in a fixed dose of 500 mg/m2 concurrently with the 5-FU over a 24-hour period. This regimen was repeated weekly. Diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting were among the dose-limiting toxicities. Others were hand-foot syndrome, hair loss of the scalp and eyelashes, overall weakness, rhinitis, and chemical conjunctivitis. The maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU in this combination and schedule was 2600 mg/m2. Seven of 14 patients treated with 2600 mg/m2 were able to tolerate the chemotherapy on a weekly basis without interruption. The other seven patients required dose reductions, but most received 5-FU at a dose of 2100 mg/m2. Twenty-three of 27 patients were treated previously. Eight patients had a partial response; five of these were treated previously. A complete response was observed in one patient with pancreatic carcinoma, previously untreated. The overall response rate for patients treated with 2100 or 2600 mg/m2 of 5-FU was nine of 18 patients (50%). Three of four previously untreated patients with pancreatic cancer responded to this treatment (two responded partially, and one had a complete response). One of three heavily pretreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer had a partial response as did a patient with breast cancer. Four of ten patients with colorectal cancer responded to the treatment (four partial responses), of whom three had been treated previously.\r"

For this patient, both the volume of distribution at steady-state (0.398 l/kg) and systemic clearance (0.0956 l/h/kg) of methotrexate were increased compared with values observed in adult patients with osteosarcoma. The terminal elimination half-life (9.29 hours) of methotrexate was similar to other reported values in adult patients, thus indicating that increases in methotrexate volume of distribution and clearance may offset each other in obesity. Based on the experience gained from this patient, the authors suggest that renal function and methotrexate serum concentrations should be monitored in obese patients receiving high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue.\r"

This increase was blocked by coadministration of oral L-365,260 (5 mg/kg/d, P less than 0.034).

All patients had histologically confirmed endometrial cancer with involvement of the endocervix. The cell types and numbers of the tumors treated were as follows: adenocarcinoma, 58; adenoacanthoma, six; adenosquamous carcinoma, nine; and clear cell carcinoma, one. Preoperative radiation consisted of 4500 cGy external therapy followed by one intracavitary implant providing an additional 2000 cGy to point A. Surgery was done 4 to 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. Five patients (7.1%) had paraaortic lymph node metastases. Four were treated with extended-field radiation therapy and one with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. After treatment, the patients were followed at regular intervals from 2 to 22 years (mean, 5.4 years). Eleven patients (15%) had recurrent cancer, with the vagina and upper abdomen being the most common sites of spread. The estimated 5-year and 10-year disease-free survival rates of these patients are 88% and 76%, respectively. Cell type, depth of myometrial invasion, and lymph node status were the most important prognostic variables in the patients evaluated. These data confirm that the combination of preoperative radiation therapy and surgery produces excellent long-term survival in patients with Stage II endometrial cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two patients seen between 1975 and 1988 were analyzed who had surgical attempts to cure locally advanced prostate cancer by exenterative procedures or salvage surgery for radiation recurrent disease. Twelve patients (Group I) underwent either a salvage cystoprostatectomy or perineal prostatectomy for radiorecurrent disease, including three patients with a Kock continent urinary diversion done in combination with the salvage operation. Five of the 12 (41.7%) recurrent disease confined to the surgical specimen and 11 of 12 (91.7%) are alive at a mean follow-up of 49 months, including four patients (25%) with a completely negative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (less than 0.2 ng/dl). All perineal prostatectomy patients are continent, and two of the three Kock pouch patients are continent. Ten of the 22 patients (Group II) had a cystoprostatectomy or exenteration for locally advanced disease that the surgeon did not think was amenable to standard radical prostatectomy. Only one of these ten patients had negative surgical margins, capsule, and seminal vesicles. Nine are alive (although only one patient has no evidence of disease) at a mean follow-up of 59 months. Morbidity was substantial with a 50% major complication rate including four patients requiring reoperation because of bleeding, abscess, bowel obstruction, or colostomy closure. Salvage procedures for radiorecurrent disease can be done safely, even with the inclusion of a continent diversion, and may be curative or provide survival benefit to carefully selected patients. Cystoprostatectomy or exenteration for locally advanced disease does not appear to be a curative endeavor for most patients and may be accompanied by significant morbidity.\r"

  ".U": "91339105\r", 
  ".W": "Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) may aid in the management of breast cancer, but is currently limited to patients without bone marrow metastases. In earlier studies, 5 logs of malignant clonogenic breast cancer cells could be eliminated from human bone marrow using a combination of chemoseparation with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) and immunoseparation with monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres. In this report the authors compare chemoimmunoseparation to treatment with immunotoxins for elimination of tumor cells from human bone marrow and for the preservation of normal precursors. Breast cancer cells from each of five cell lines were mixed with a tenfold excess of irradiated human bone marrow cells. Treatment with a combination of five immunotoxins reduced clonogenic tumor cell growth by 1.8 to 5.5 logs depending upon the cell line. With two of the five cell lines, clonogenic tumor cells were eliminated quantitatively. Using the CAMA-1 breast cancer cell line, treatment with multiple immunotoxins was compared with chemoimmunoseparation with 4-HC, a panel of five unconjugated monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres. Chemoimmunoseparation eliminated 3.5 to 5.4 logs of malignant cells, while preserving 21% of Colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and 37% of burst-forming unit-erythrocyte (BFU-E). No clonogenic breast cancer cells could be detected. Immunotoxin treatment eliminated 2.2 to 5.4 logs of clonogenic breast cancer cells, but had no effect on the bone marrow precursors. In seven of ten experiments, however, clonogenic breast cancer cells remained after immunotoxin treatment. Consequently, treatment with 4-HC, multiple murine monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres provided more consistent elimination of tumor cells than separation with immunotoxins, but was significantly more toxic for marrow precursors.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with lung cancer (LC) have a reduced T-cell proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared with that of healthy individuals. This decreased response is a result of an inhibitory effect exerted by the monocytes as evidenced by: (1) a restoration to normal levels of the response to PHA when the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were depleted of adherent cells (AD) and (2) a dose-dependent inhibition of the response to PHA when the nonadherent cell population was co-cultured with increasing numbers of autologous AD cells. The addition of indomethacin to the cultures resulted in only a partial restoration of the response to PHA. Monocyte production of interleukin-1 from patients with LC in response to lipopolysaccharide was normal. These findings support the hypothesis that the AD cell population plays a major role in the low T-cell proliferative response to PHA in patients with LC. This suppressor effect is partially mediated by the prostaglandins released by the monocytes.\r"

Sixty-four specimens showed morphologic evidence of BLPD, demonstrating a heterogeneous spectrum with various degrees of plasmacytoid differentiation. Immunophenotypic evidence of clonality was found in six patients. The ISH detected EBV sequences in all ten patients, including 60 of the 64 specimens with morphologic evidence of BLPD. In addition, ISH identified EBV-infected lymphoid cells in two of 17 sites without morphologic evidence of BLPD. These data demonstrate the utility of ISH for detecting EBV genome in this setting and provide further evidence for the etiologic role of EBV in the pathogenesis of BLPD.\r"

Thirty-six (84%) of 43 patients with decreased Ha-ras p21 expression died of aggressive disease. The Ha-ras DNA was examined in the 32 tumors by Southern blot analysis. Neither augmentation nor deletion of the Ha-ras DNA was observed. Amplification of the N-myc DNA was also examined in 43 cases in comparison with Ha-ras p21 expression. N-myc amplification was detected in 12 (55%) of 22 patients who died, and 19 (86%) of the 22 patients showed a low expression of the Ha-ras p21 in tumor cells. Eighteen (86%) of 21 survivors showed a high expression of the Ha-ras p21. The expression of Ha-ras p21 was thought to be a clinically important marker for prognosis in children with neuroblastoma.\r"

Normal breast lobular and ductal epithelium and benign breast lesions showed Leb staining but only occasional Lea staining. In invasive ductal carcinomas of breast, of all grades, a loss of Leb antigen staining was found in 80% of the breast cancer cases. This reduced Leb antigen expression increased with the grade of malignancy. Therefore, the loss of Leb blood group antigens on breast cancer cell surfaces may suggest altered fucosylation patterns in malignant cells and reflect the degree of malignancy and/or invasiveness.\r"

Low and high mitotic count groups had significantly different prognoses for T1c, T2, and T3 tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that the best combination of features predicting tumor-related death were high mitotic count (relative risk, x 2.8), large tumor size (relative risk, x 1.7), lymphatic invasion (relative risk, x 1.7), and skin or subjacent muscle or chest wall invasion (relative risk, x 2.5). Nuclear grade, Bloom-Richardson grade, modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade, Fisher's grade, and necrosis correlated well with survival but had no significant additional predictive value when adjusted for the mitotic count.\r"

Six other family members had malignancies including malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, adenocarcinoma of the colon, and asynchronous bilateral in situ and invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. There was also a history of autoimmune disorders and exposure to smoke, fumes, and chemicals in some family members. Regression analysis revealed a significant covariate risk for exposure to smoking, alcohol ingestion, dust, salted or spicy foods, and poorly ventilated conditions. According to segregation analysis, the susceptibility to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and other malignancies in this family was transmitted as an autosomal codominant characteristic. A specific histocompatibility antigen (HLA) haplotype of A1-B37-DR6 was associated with a predisposition for NPC, but no linkage was identified. Laboratory studies in selected family members did not reveal significantly elevated levels of Epstein-Barr virus antibodies or serum carcinoembryonic antigen. No specific karyotypic abnormalities were identified with peripheral blood chromosome analysis. This family was an example of apparent autosomal codominant susceptibility to NPC and other malignancies. The relationship of malignancy to the HLA haplotype of A1-B37-DR6, autoimmune disorders, and cytogenetic abnormalities was intriguing but not defined clearly.\r"

Location, size, multicentricity, and malignancy of the gastrinomas were evaluated. The MEN-1 patients had gastrinomas in the duodenum (nine of 18), pancreas (one of 18), and periduodenal lymph nodes (two of 18). No gastrinoma was identified in six patients. Most duodenal gastrinomas were multiple (five of nine) and smaller than 0.6 cm (six of nine). Lymph node metastases were present in eight of 12 patients. All 26 patients with sporadic ZES had a solitary gastrinoma; 14 were found in the pancreas and had a diameter greater than 2 cm. Ten patients had a duodenal gastrinoma, two with a diameter less than 0.6 cm. In two patients, only periduodenal \"lymph node gastrinomas\" were detected. Eighteen of the sporadic gastrinomas were malignant. These results suggest that duodenal location and multicentricity of gastrinomas are associated with the MEN-1 syndrome, and solitary gastrinomas, either in the pancreas or the duodenum, are predominantly seen in sporadic ZES.\r"

  ".W": "A distinct type of cervical involvement by endometrial cancer is reported and termed cervical implantation metastasis. It is believed to result from implantation of endometrial cancer on the denuded endocervix after fractional dilatation and curettage (D & C). The histologic criteria for diagnosis are: (1) the cervical implantation metastasis must be imbedded in the endocervical epithelium or superficial stroma surrounded by an implantation site of inflammatory cells and granulation tissue (free-floating cancer cells above the cervical mucosa are not acceptable as implantation tissue), (2) the histologic findings of the cervical implantation metastasis must be similar to those of the endometrial adenocarcinoma in the uterine corpus, (3) the cervical implantation metastasis must be separate from the primary tumor with no evidence of direct extension, and (4) the cervical implantation metastasis should be surrounded by nonneoplastic endocervical glands with no transition between the two. Of the 176 patients who underwent fractional D & C before hysterectomy, nine (5%) were found to have cervical implantation metastasis. No patients had cervical implantation metastasis who did not undergo fractional D & C before hysterectomy. When stratified according to stage, grade, and myometrial invasion, there was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between patients with or without cervical implantation metastasis. It appears that cervical implantation metastasis does not alter prognosis or require specific treatment.\r"

The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was also studied. In the normal cervix, basal cells were usually ER positive, PR negative, and Ki-67 negative throughout the menstrual cycle. Parabasal cells were ER positive and PR negative in the follicular phase, but ER negative and PR positive, and Ki-67 positive in the luteal phase, and Ki-67-positive cells increased in number in the luteal phase. In contrast, PR positivity was observed in the cells of condyloma (2 of 2 cases), CIN (19 of 26 cases), and invasive squamous carcinoma (13 of 22 cases) irrespective of the menstrual phase. Moreover, most neoplastic cells containing HPV DNA type 16/18 were ER negative, whereas several lesions containing HPV DNA type 31/33/35 were weakly ER positive. Many Ki-67-labeled cells were observed in the neoplastic lesions. These results suggest that reduced ER expression and increased PR expression are associated with the proliferation of normal cervical squamous epithelium, and this proliferation-related receptor status, which is probably induced by HPV infection, is usually expressed in neoplastic cervical squamous cells.\r"

The data included cases born and diagnosed in Minnesota since 1969. Matched analyses were conducted using 337 cases and 1336 birth year-matched controls. There was a statistically significant increased odds of ALL for birth to older (greater than 35 years) mothers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28, 3.58), older fathers (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.14, 2.30), mothers with at least a high school education (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.48), and larger intervals (greater than 5 years) between the birth of the proband and the preceding sibling (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.12, 3.09). The increased odds of ALL for birth by Caesarean section approached significance (OR = 1.42, P = 0.06). No overall association was found for: gender, race, paternal education, fetal-loss history, birth order, prenatal care history, pregnancy complications, inducement of labor, multiple birth, gestational age, or birth weight. Age at diagnosis was an important effect modifier of some analyses. For cases diagnosed before age 2 years, there was a 2.7-fold increased odds of ALL if the last pregnancy had resulted in a fetal loss (P = 0.03). For cases diagnosed before age 4 years, birth weight greater than 3800 g was associated with a significant 2.05-fold increased odds of ALL. These data strengthen the hypothesis that prenatal events may play a causative role in childhood ALL, particularly in those cases diagnosed at a younger age.\r"

A 7-year-old boy with Stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, after conventional chemotherapy, underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Five months later he presented with supraclavicular mass and mediastinal enlargement. A bone marrow biopsy showed hypoplasia with no signs of the underlying disease, whereas the excised mass revealed a typical histologic pattern of Kaposi's sarcoma. The child is currently being treated with recombinant alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) and regression of the disease has been achieved.\r"

  ".W": "Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia is a heterogeneous disorder of unclear etiology and has a wide spectrum of systemic symptoms. This report describes a case of this disorder in a 15-year-old girl and examines the response of the primary mass, systemic symptoms, and alterations of selected immune parameters at diagnosis, as a result of steroid therapy and radiation therapy (RT). The patient had a 1-year history of growth failure, delayed puberty, and refractory iron deficiency anemia. Computed tomography scan showed a posterior mediastinal mass. Biopsy revealed angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia of mixed hyaline-vascular and plasma cell type histologic type. Immunoperoxidase studies showed polyclonal B-cells, predominance of T-helper cells (CD4) over cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells (CD8), and the presence of natural killer (NK) cells. Southern blot analysis demonstrated germ line gene configuration for the T-cell antigen receptor and Ig heavy chain. The patient clinically improved with RT after failing to respond to steroids. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes before therapy revealed a CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.8 with decreased numbers of circulating T-cells; this increased to 1.4 after steroid therapy. The patient's T-lymphocytes had no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or concanavalin A (Con A) before RT. After RT, a small but significant mitogenic response to these reagents was noticed. The proliferative response to recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) remained similar to that of control lymphocytes. Induction of second messenger signals by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and elevation of free cytosolic calcium through the use of the phorbol ester, phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and ionomycin (Io) resulted in a strong proliferative response at diagnosis and after RT. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed diminished NK activity before and after therapy. Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity remained comparable with that of control cells and was not affected by therapy. Before RT patient lymphocytes maintained cytotoxic capabilities after coincubation with rIL-2 and PDBu plus Io, whereas coincubation with these reagents abrogated cytotoxic function of normal cells. This case demonstrates a clinical response to RT as well as improvement in immune parameters. Intact signal transduction mechanisms through PKC activation and elevation of cytosolic calcium were also demonstrated in the circulating lymphocytes.\r"

Bone marrow transplantation from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible sibling donor was performed 26 months after the diagnosis of the primary malignancy. Although it is unproven that the alkylating agents administered to this patient were responsible for the myelodysplastic syndrome, careful follow-up of osteosarcoma patients who receive alkylating agents is warranted.\r"

Mechanisms of cutaneous and incisional implantation metastases are discussed. Adjuvant therapy with intraperitoneal P-32 is unable to provide systemic therapy for occult metastatic disease. The favorable outcome in these cases probably reflects limited tumor burden at the time of recurrence and stands in stark contrast to other cases of soft tissue recurrences of ovarian carcinoma reported previously.\r"

The association of SLE and solid tumors in the same patient is reviewed. The frequency of this association appears to be low and the most often described tumors are of uterine and bladder origin. The clinical course of the solid malignancy in these patients is not always described in detail. Careful epidemiologic studies on the true incidence of solid tumors in patients with SLE are required to better understand this association.\r"

Parity was associated strongly with decreased prolactin levels, and increasing age was associated strongly with decreased growth hormone levels. After controlling for these variables, no differences in prolactin or growth hormone levels were found among the three groups of women.

The data from four existing samples of cancer patients demonstrate that the CARES-SF is highly related to the CARES (r = 0.98), has excellent test-retest reliability (86% agreement), concurrent validity with related measures, and acceptable internal consistency of summary scales (alpha = 0.85 to 0.61). In a new sample of breast cancer patients evaluated at three points in time (1 month, 7 months, and 13 months after diagnosis) the instrument appears to be sensitive to change and is highly related to the Functional Living Index--Cancer (FLIC), an existing quality of life instrument. The authors conclude that the CARES-SF has excellent potential as a quality of life instrument for use in clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "These experiments tested the hypothesis that differences in the distribution of subepicardial and subendocardial microvascular resistances may alter the transmural distributions of microvascular pressures. Isolated blood- and physiological saline-perfused porcine hearts were surgically incised to enable exposure of the subendocardial and subepicardial microcirculations. Microvascular pressures were measured during cardiac arrest and maximal vasodilation at various perfusion pressures to formulate relations between perfusion pressure and microvascular pressure in the different subendocardial (both free wall and papillary muscle) and subepicardial segments. Measurements of arteriolar and venular pressures in both myocardial regions were performed in comparably sized vessels (80-120 microns in diameter). At a coronary perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg, subendocardial arteriolar and venular pressures were 60 +/- 4 and 33 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively. In contrast, at the same coronary perfusion pressure, arteriolar and venular pressures in the subepicardial microcirculation averaged 80 +/- 6 and 22 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05 versus subendocardium). At all levels of coronary perfusion pressure, arteriolar pressures were significantly lower in the subendocardium than in the subepicardium (p less than 0.05). Venular pressures were also higher in the subendocardial microcirculation than in the subepicardial microcirculation at all but the lowest perfusion pressure (p less than 0.05). The relative distribution of resistances in arteries, microvessels, and veins was also different between the subepicardium and subendocardium. Specifically, in the subendocardium, arterial and venous resistances were higher, percentage-wise, but microvascular resistance was proportionately lower than that in the subepicardium (p less than 0.05). From these data, it is concluded that the distribution of microvascular resistances and pressures is different during maximal vasodilation in the subepicardial and subendocardial microcirculations of the left ventricle. It is also speculated that differences in autoregulatory capacity and vulnerability to ischemia may be partially related to unequal distribution of microvascular resistances across the wall of the left ventricle.\r"

In concentrations of 3 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-7) M, endothelin produced dose-dependent increases in the amplitudes of both aequorin light signals (maximum, 31 +/- 12%) and developed tension (maximum, 64 +/- 13%). The peak aequorin light [( Ca2+]i)-peak tension curve generated by increasing endothelin concentrations was steeper and shifted to the left of the curve generated by varying [Ca2+]o; however, the maximum developed tension produced by endothelin did not exceed that produced by 6 mM [Ca2+]o. The effect of endothelin on the amplitude of the aequorin light signal was less than the effect of [Ca2+]o for similar levels of tension development. Moreover, 1 x 10(-7) M endothelin caused an upward shift in the peak aequorin light-peak tension curve generated by varying [Ca2+]o and increased the maximum twitch force by about 12%. The contractions were prolonged, whereas the time course of the Ca2+ transient was not changed in the presence of endothelin. When the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum was inhibited by 6 microM ryanodine, 10(-7) M endothelin still increased the force generation without increasing the intracellular peak Ca2+, either during isometric twitches or during tetani.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Chronic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) results in left ventricular (LV) dilatation and dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for LV failure in this setting are not known. LV force production is dependent on the coupling of myocytes to the extracellular matrix, which is mediated through the basement membrane. This study was designed to determine whether alterations in myocyte geometry and basement membrane attachment are associated with LV failure in a pacing-induced model of cardiomyopathy. Echocardiographic measurement of LV function was performed in six pigs after 3 weeks of pacing-induced SVT (240 beats/min) and in eight sham-operated controls. Myocytes from these hearts were isolated, and attachment studies to specific components of the basement membrane were performed using laminin, fibronectin, and collagen IV. The SVT group when compared with the control group showed a significant reduction of LV fractional shortening (14 +/- 2% versus 31 +/- 2%, respectively; p less than 0.05), increased end-diastolic dimension (50 +/- 1 versus 35 +/- 1 mm, respectively; p less than 0.05), and lengthening of isolated myocytes (196 +/- 18 versus 142 +/- 9 microns, respectively; p less than 0.05). Myocyte attachment to laminin (50 micrograms/ml) was significantly decreased at 60 minutes in the SVT group compared with the control group (18.2 +/- 4.5 versus 60.9 +/- 4.5 cells/mm2, respectively; p less than 0.05). Similar reductions in myocyte attachment to fibronectin and collagen IV were observed. Ultrastructural examination of LV sections revealed focal disruptions of the basement membrane-sarcolemmal interface and a reduced number of sarcolemmal festoons in SVT hearts compared with control hearts (0.8 +/- 0.6 versus 2.8 +/- 0.8/4 microns, respectively; p less than 0.05). These alterations in myocyte morphology and basement membrane attachment may contribute to the LV failure associated with chronic SVT. Further, these structural changes may play a significant role in the progression of ventricular dysfunction as well as recovery from chronic SVT.\r"

The aortic arch was banded to an outer diameter of 1.0 mm. After 14 days, LV and right ventricular functional parameters and transstenotic pressure gradient were measured in anesthetized rats. In addition, regional heart weights were determined, and myocytes of three different heart regions were isolated and subjected to morphometric analysis. To inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, ramipril was administered orally by gavage in a single daily dose of 1 mg/kg. Rats with aortic stenosis showed a marked increase in LV systolic pressure, mean prestenotic aortic pressure, and LV stroke work compared with sham-operated rats and demonstrated a systolic transstenotic pressure gradient of 82 mm Hg. This increase in LV hemodynamic load was paralleled by the development of LV hypertrophy as determined by a 37% increase in LV weight and by a 20% increase in cell volume of isolated LV myocytes. Concomitant ramipril treatment did not significantly affect LV functional parameters. The transstenotic pressure gradient was the same as in untreated rats with aortic stenosis. Likewise, the weight gain of the LV as well as the development of cellular hypertrophy of the LV were not influenced. Thus, in this model, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition did not reduce the development of LV hypertrophy independent of the hemodynamic load.\r"

This study was designed to determine the effects of testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol treatment on TXA2 receptors in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). TXA2 receptor affinity and density were determined through equilibrium binding experiments using the TXA2/prostaglandin H2 mimetic [1S-(1 alpha,2 beta(5Z),3 alpha(1E,3R*),4 alpha)]-7-[3-(3- hydroxy-4-(4'-125iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hep tan-2-yl]- 5-heptenoic acid (125I-BOP). Incubation with testosterone (100 nM) for 24 or 48 hours resulted in a significant (p less than 0.05) 31% and 48% increase in TXA2 receptor density without any change in affinity. 17 beta-Estradiol (100 nM) had no significant effect on either the density or affinity of TXA2 receptors. Coincubation with the testosterone receptor antagonist hydroxyflutamide (1 microM) blocked the testosterone-induced increase in TXA2 receptor density. The maximum increase in intracellular free calcium induced by I-BOP was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater in testosterone-treated RASMCs than controls. Similarly, increases in inositol trisphosphate induced by the TXA2/prostaglandin H2 mimetic U46619 were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater in testosterone-treated RASMCs compared with controls. The results demonstrate that testosterone increases vascular TXA2 receptor density and support the notion that sex steroid hormones modulate the expression of this receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The voltage-dependent properties of the voltage-activated sodium channel were studied in neonatal (1-2-day-old) and adult rat ventricular cardiac myocytes using the whole-cell variation of the patch-clamp technique (16 degrees C, [Na]i = 15 mM, [Na]o = 25 mM). The voltage dependence of the sodium conductance-membrane potential relation was similar in both neonatal and adult myocytes except for a difference in slope; the adult sodium conductance-membrane potential relation was slightly more steep. Neonatal cells also differed from adult cells by demonstrating a more negative voltage midpoint of their sodium availability curve, a slower rate of recovery from inactivation at hyperpolarized potentials, and a greater extent of slow inactivation development compared with adult cells. Phenytoin (40 microM) reduced the sodium current in a tonic and use-dependent manner in both adult and neonatal myocytes. However, phenytoin (40 microM) produced significantly more tonic block at negative holding potentials (e.g., -140 mV) in neonatal myocytes (22 +/- 5% [mean +/- SEM], n = 14) than in adult myocytes (10 +/- 2%, n = 11) (p less than 0.05). The amplitudes of use-dependent block obtained during trains of 1-second pulses to -20 mV were also significantly greater in neonatal myocytes than in adult myocytes when the diastolic interval was varied over a range of 0.1-1.5 seconds (p less than 0.05). Definition of the time courses of block development at -20 mV indicated that phenytoin had a slightly higher affinity for inactivated sodium channels in neonatal cells. In addition, the time constant of recovery from use-dependent block by phenytoin was found to be significantly longer in neonatal cells than in adult cells at membrane potentials between -160 and -100 mV (p less than 0.001). The marked differences in phenytoin effect on cardiac sodium channels in neonatal versus adult rat cardiac myocytes suggest that there may be significant developmental changes in the sodium channel blocking effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs in cardiac tissue.\r"

Studies were performed in seven adult mongrel dogs in which intermittent followed by permanent occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery produced an area of collateral-dependent myocardium without gross evidence of infarct. Myocardial blood flow was determined with microspheres while measurement of aortic and distal coronary pressures allowed calculation of collateral and small vessel resistance at rest and during treadmill exercise. The ability of collateral vessel constriction to limit blood flow was assessed by infusion of vasopressin during exercise. During control conditions, blood flow in the collateral zone underwent a subnormal increase during exercise in comparison with the normal zone (1.74 +/- 0.27 versus 2.50 +/- 0.40 ml/min/g, respectively, p less than 0.05). Infusion of vasopressin in a dose that caused no change in normal zone flow (0.01 microgram/kg/min i.v.) produced a 30 +/- 5% further decrease in flow to the collateral zone (p less than 0.01). This decrease in collateral zone flow resulted from a 48 +/- 14% increase in transcollateral resistance in response to vasopressin infusion (p less than 0.01), as well as a 40 +/- 9% increase in small vessel resistance in the collateral zone (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that active constriction of both collateral vessels and coronary resistance vessels can contribute to hypoperfusion of collateral-dependent myocardium during exercise.\r"

Fiber bundles were obtained from left ventricles of fetal rabbits at the 30th day of gestation, newborn rabbits aged 1, 3, 8, and 17 days, and adult rabbits. Total creatine kinase activity was constant during perinatal development, whereas myofibrillar bound creatine kinase activity increased 15-fold during the first postnatal week. Functional activity of myofibrillar creatine kinase was assayed in Triton X-100-skinned fibers by its ability to induce active tension in the absence of ATP or to relax rigor tension. It was very low in 1-day-old newborns and increased during the first 2 weeks to reach adult levels 17 days after birth. Functional activity of mitochondrial creatine kinase was determined in saponin-skinned fibers. Creatine-stimulated respiration appeared only after birth and increased gradually between 1 and 17 days after birth. The results show that, although the two creatine kinase isoforms (mitochondrial and myofibrillar) are expressed at different stages during development, their functional activities appear in parallel in mitochondria and myofibrils. Early postnatal development is characterized by binding of creatine kinase isoenzymes to intracellular organelles. Such compartmentation participates in the postnatal cardiac cellular maturation.\r"

  ".U": "91339252\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiac toxicity is a frequent manifestation in amitriptyline overdose and is felt to be due, in part, to sodium channel blockade by the drug. Another agent with sodium channel blocking properties, diphenylhydantoin, has been used clinically to reverse cardiac conduction abnormalities induced by amitriptyline. This reversal of toxicity is believed to occur secondary to competition for the sodium channel binding site. We evaluated individually and in combination the effects of amitriptyline (0.4 microM) and diphenylhydantoin (10-80 microM) on the sodium current in isolated rabbit atrial and ventricular myocytes at 17 degrees C. Using the whole-cell variant of the patch-clamp technique, we found that both amitriptyline and diphenylhydantoin reduced the sodium current in a use-dependent fashion. The time constant of recovery (tau r) from block by amitriptyline at -130 mV was very slow (13.6 +/- 3.2 seconds), whereas tau r during diphenylhydantoin exposure was fast (0.71 +/- 0.21 seconds, p less than 0.0001 compared with amitriptyline). During exposure of cells to a mixture of the two drugs, tau r was found to be 6.6 +/- 1.8 seconds, but no evidence of direct competition between amitriptyline and diphenylhydantoin was seen. Attempts to fit the recovery data of the mixture to two exponentials resulted in no significant improvement in the fit when compared with that using a single exponential. Use of the sodium channel blocking agent lidocaine (similar kinetics to diphenylhydantoin) in competition with amitriptyline resulted in findings consistent with direct competition of these two drugs for a single binding site. These observations prompted us to evaluate the possibility that diphenylhydantoin was not acting at (and therefore not competing for) the same channel binding site as amitriptyline. Experiments altering pHi and pHo revealed dramatic differences between amitriptyline and diphenylhydantoin. When pHo was increased from 7.4 to 8.0, tau r was reduced approximately threefold (from 13.6 +/- 3.2 to 4.2 +/- 0.1 seconds, p less than 0.0001) during exposure to amitriptyline, but no effect was seen on tau r after exposure to diphenylhydantoin. Conversely, when pHi was increased from 7.3 to 8.0, tau r after amitriptyline was unaffected, but tau r after diphenylhydantoin markedly increased (from 0.71 +/- 0.21 to 2.60 +/- 1.30 seconds, p less than 0.001). Additionally, diphenylhydantoin block demonstrated profound voltage dependence across the range of -130 to -90 mV, whereas amitriptyline block appeared less voltage sensitive. Single-channel studies using patch-clamp techniques in isolated ventricular myocytes supported these data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Acetylcholine was injected locally through a catheter positioned in the coronary artery ostium using fluoroscopic guidance in intact sedated baboons. With heart rate held constant, intracoronary acetylcholine (0.5 micrograms/kg) reduced coronary blood flow by 82 +/- 4% from a baseline value of 34 +/- 4 ml/min without a significant change in mean arterial pressure and with a reduction in LV dP/dt of only 12 +/- 3%. The decrease in coronary blood flow occurred before either LV dP/dt or regional myocardial function fell in the region of the heart receiving acetylcholine. After the intense coronary constriction, a later phase characterized by dilation was observed. The changes in coronary blood flow with acetylcholine were unaffected by combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockades but were abolished by muscarinic blockade. Low doses of acetylcholine elicited only coronary vasodilation. All doses of acetylcholine, administered directly into the iliac artery, also elicited only iliac vasodilation. Intracoronary acetylcholine in conscious dogs also induced only coronary vasodilation, whereas in conscious calves at higher doses, initial vasoconstrictor responses were observed, which also preceded reductions in regional myocardial function. These results suggest that the controversy surrounding the effects of acetylcholine can be reconciled on the basis of species, vascular bed studied, and dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bilateral adrenal demedullation was performed in 4-week-old sympathectomized SHR and WKY rats. The development of hypertension in SHR was prevented by sympathectomy, but the blood pressure (BP) was still higher than in age-matched WKY rats. Demedullation reduced the BP of sympathectomized SHR to the same level as that of WKY rats. Heart rates of SHR and WKY rats were not affected by the treatments. Morphometric measurements of the mesenteric arteries showed that sympathectomy significantly reduced the medial mass in the mesenteric arteries of SHR, mainly through a reduction in the number of smooth muscle cell layers. In sympathectomized SHR, demedullation increased the lumen size of muscular arteries under maximally relaxed conditions, which might explain the further reduction in BP in these animals. Demedullation in sympathectomized SHR and WKY rats caused a decrease in smooth muscle cell layers in the superior mesenteric artery, but the same treatment resulted in a slight increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers in the large and small mesenteric arteries of SHR and WKY rats. Adventitial area was increased in some mesenteric arteries of SHR and WKY rats by sympathectomy, and demedullation caused a further increase in the size of adventitia in WKY rats. Heart weight in SHR was normalized to the level found in WKY rats by sympathectomy and demedullation. We conclude that in sympathectomized SHR, the elevated BP was maintained by the adrenal medulla.\r"

In this study we tested the hypothesis that cardiac cells have a preferred orientation in their response to excitatory extracellular electric fields, so that orthogonal shocks may stimulate distinct populations of cells. A micropaddle electrode system was used to deliver rectangular pulses for extracellular field stimulation of individual heart cells. We found that single frog and guinea pig ventricular myocytes are excitable with rectangular pulse field stimulation over a wide range of pulse durations, ranging from 10 msec to as little as 20 microseconds. The excitation field strength varies inversely with pulse duration as described by the Weiss-Lapicque equation, although the frog myocytes show a significant \"notch\" at pulse durations of approximately 1-2 msec, and the guinea pig myocytes are more excitable than predicted for pulse durations of less than 0.2 msec. Every myocyte tested was more excitable when the long axis of the cell was oriented parallel to the stimulating field than when perpendicular to the field. For 2-msec pulses, the difference in field strength was a factor of 5.8 +/- 2.0 (n = 30) for frog and 2.6 +/- 0.5 (n = 23) for guinea pig myocytes. Complete excitation strength-duration curves were obtained in seven frog and 14 guinea pig cells for both parallel and perpendicular cell orientations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91339257\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals contribute to the pathogenesis of postischemic myocardial dysfunction (myocardial \"stunning\"). This concept, however, is predicated exclusively on results obtained in open-chest preparations, which are subject to the confounding influence of many unphysiological conditions. The lack of supporting evidence in more physiological animal models represents a major persisting limitation of the oxy-radical hypothesis of myocardial stunning. The goal of this study was to address two fundamental (and related) questions: 1) Does the open-chest animal model alter the phenomenon of myocardial stunning? 2) If so, how valid are the concepts, derived from such a model, regarding the pathogenetic role of oxy-radicals? In part 1 of the study, myocardial stunning after a 15-minute coronary occlusion was compared in 30 pentobarbital-anesthetized open-chest dogs and in 19 conscious dogs. For any given level of collateral flow during occlusion, the recovery of systolic wall thickening after reperfusion was markedly less in open-chest animals. In an additional group of five open-chest dogs, a close inverse relation was noted between body temperature and postischemic wall thickening, indicating that the recovery of the stunned myocardium in acute experiments may vary markedly depending on how temperature is controlled. Because of these major differences between open-chest and conscious dogs, the oxy-radical hypothesis needs to be tested in the latter model. Thus, in part 2 of the study, conscious unsedated dogs undergoing a 15-minute coronary occlusion were randomized to an intravenous infusion of either saline (19 coronary occlusions) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) plus catalase (CAT) (21 coronary occlusions). Despite the fact that the plasma levels of SOD and CAT declined rapidly after reperfusion, postischemic wall thickening was significantly greater in treated compared with control dogs throughout the first 6 hours of reflow. Thus, a brief (60-minute) infusion of SOD and CAT produced a sustained improvement of recovery of contractility. The magnitude of this beneficial effect was a function of the severity of ischemia: the lower the collateral perfusion, the greater the improvement effected by the enzymes. The accelerated recovery produced by SOD and CAT was not followed by any deterioration of contractility, suggesting that postischemic dysfunction is not a teleologically \"protective\" phenomenon. In conclusion, the severity of myocardial stunning is greatly exaggerated by the unphysiological conditions present in the barbiturate-anesthetized open-chest dog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In an effort to find an optimal experimental model of arterial SMC proliferation after injury, we examined the effects of external injury to the central artery of the rabbit ear and assessed the reproducibility, morphological changes, and time course of cellular proliferation after such an injury. With rabbits under general anesthesia, direct pressure was applied at two sites along the central artery of the ears of 19 New Zealand White rabbits. Rabbits were maintained on a diet of 2.4% fat and 0.001% cholesterol throughout the experiment. In seven rabbits examined after 21 days, marked SMC proliferation with neointimal formation was observed at all 28 sites (100%). Mean neointimal area, expressed as a percentage of the area of the tunica media, was 82 +/- 40% (range, 21-203%). Compared with the uninvolved artery displaced 2 mm from the injury site, mechanical crush caused a 38% increase in total vessel area (p less than 0.001), a 40% decrease in luminal area (p less than 0.002), and no change in the area of the media. Serial histological studies were performed 1-42 days after injury, using light and electron microscopy and bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry. Beginning at day 3, activated medial SMCs were noted to migrate through defects in the internal elastic membrane, with a gradual increase in neointimal area between days 5 and 12. Peak DNA synthesis was identified in the media 5 days after injury, with proliferative activity shifting almost exclusively to the neointima thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although enhanced growth of the vascular myocyte is believed to play a role in hypertensive cardiovascular disease, the cellular basis of altered growth regulation is not completely understood. The present study demonstrates that in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, the logarithmic growth rate of cultured mesenteric artery myocytes of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is similar to that of the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rat. However, in the presence of low levels of fetal calf serum, SHR myocytes respond to epidermal growth factor (EGF) with increased growth, whereas WKY cells do not. This difference does not result from different numbers or affinities of EGF receptors in these cell lines. Examination of EGF-induced growth responses of SHR and WKY myocytes in the presence of varying levels of insulin or fetal calf serum indicates that, compared with WKY myocytes, SHR myocytes have a lower requirement for factors that confer competence to respond to EGF. Another property of the SHR myocytes is an elevation of free intracellular Ca2+. To determine whether a difference in cellular Ca2+ metabolism might play a role in the differential growth response, growth of myocytes in medium containing 0.25, 0.75, or 1.25 mM extracellular Ca2+ and 5% fetal calf serum was examined. Myocytes of SHR showed enhanced growth in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum at all levels of extracellular Ca2+. It is concluded that, although vascular myocytes of SHR and WKY rats have the capacity to grow at similar rates, under limiting conditions, the SHR myocyte growth response is enhanced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, 11 conscious dogs were instrumented with global ultrasonic dimension transducers to measure left ventricular major and minor axis diameters and equatorial wall thickness. Myocardial geometry was represented as a three-dimensional ellipsoidal shell. Left ventricular transmural pressure was measured with micromanometers, and ventricular volume was varied by inflation of vena caval occluders. Left ventricular wall strains and stresses calculated from the ellipsoidal shell model agreed closely with those measured directly by myocardial force and dimension transducers. Unequal normalized diastolic stress-strain relations were observed in the latitudinal, longitudinal, and wall thickness directions, reflecting anisotropic mechanical properties of the myocardium. Although a greater wall stress in the latitudinal versus longitudinal axis was predicted adequately from left ventricular geometry alone, the observed latitudinal strain exceeded longitudinal strain by an amount greater than was predicted by geometric considerations alone, suggesting that myocardial anisotropy contributes significantly to changes in ventricular shape during diastolic filling.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine intact, working pig hearts were extracorporeally perfused and divided into two study groups (16 Aerobic and 13 Ischemic/Reflow hearts). Step function, equilibrium labeling with [14C]palmitate was used to develop uptake and washout curves of radioactive fatty acid products contained in coronary effluent during either aerobic perfusion or reperfusion after ischemia (60% reduction in left anterior descending coronary flow for 30 minutes). Left anterior descending control flows were slightly overperfused in Aerobic hearts (18% higher than in Ischemic/Reflow hearts); otherwise, circumflex and right coronary flows, left ventricular pressure, and serum fatty acids and blood sugar levels were comparable between groups. As expected in Ischemic/Reflow hearts, recovery of regional systolic shortening and myocardial oxygen consumption in reperfusion was only modestly impaired (-20% and -19%, respectively, not significant and p less than 0.011 compared with preischemic values, not significant from Aerobic hearts). The only significant metabolized product to be released from labeled fatty acid utilization in either group was 14CO2. A smaller fatty acid pool also was measured and accounted for by that contained in the coronary intravascular volume. We could determine no significant back diffusion of fatty acids from myocardium in either perfusion condition. Uptake time constants of the early phase of 14CO2 production also were virtually identical in both groups (19.9 +/- 3.2 versus 16.7 +/- 3.2 minutes in Aerobic and Ischemic/Reflow hearts, respectively) and strongly correlated with hemodynamics as described by heart rate. In washout studies, tissue radioactivity in the aqueous soluble and fatty acid pools declined in both study groups, and counts in complex lipids and cholesterol/cholesteryl esters remained steady, whereas those in triacylglycerols varied. Washout of 14CO2 in both groups never reached background radioactivity over a 40-minute sampling after cessation of isotope infusion into the perfusate, suggesting slow release of trapped substrate from intracellular pools, which then proceeded to fatty acid oxidation. In conclusion, these experiments have demonstrated very similar findings with respect to fatty acid uptake, storage, and release characteristics between aerobic and reperfused myocardium. We found no differences in preferred substrate utilization and oxidation as a result of reversible ischemia followed by reflow.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of adenosine and the nonmetabolizable adenosine analogue N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (PIA) on glucose transport or metabolism were determined in purified myocardial sarcolemmal vesicles, isolated cardiocytes, and perfused hearts. Adenosine (100 microM) did not affect hexose transport in myocytes. Also, adenosine deaminase, added to metabolize adenosine to inosine, did not alter transport of hexose into myocytes regardless of whether or not insulin was present. In contrast, PIA effectively inhibited 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake in myocytes even during insulin stimulation. PIA inhibited D-glucose-specific transport in both rat and bovine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles (Ki = 26 microM at [D-glucose] = 5 mM). However, insulin did not affect glucose transport in sarcolemmal vesicles, which implies that receptor-coupled processes probably are not intact in this preparation. Thus, inhibition of PIA may not be receptor mediated. Also, PIA inhibited binding of cytochalasin B to bovine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles, which supports the idea that PIA inhibits glucose flux by binding to the glucose transporter. To determine if adenosine altered glucose metabolism rather than transport, we measured the rate of 3H2O production from metabolism of D-[2-3H]glucose in paced rat hearts ([D-glucose] = 5.5 mM, [pyruvate] = 0.2 mM) perfused with a range of PIA or adenosine concentrations with or without 0.01 microM insulin. Adenosine (0.01-100 microM) in the presence or absence of insulin increased coronary flow but did not change glycolytic rates. Similar results were obtained with PIA (no insulin) rather than adenosine in the perfusate. However, with glucose as the only exogenous substrate, 100 microM PIA inhibited glycolysis by approximately 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, direct measurement of the rapid alterations of [Ca2+]i on a beat-to-beat basis using fast temporal resolution and without signal averaging in the spontaneously beating in vivo heart is lacking. Furthermore, data from an isolated spontaneously beating myocyte preparation that develops arrhythmia similar to that in the in vivo heart are unavailable. We measured rapid changes of [Ca2+]i with fast temporal resolution in isolated spontaneously beating neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with cell-to-cell communication and characterized the interrelation between [Ca2+]i and arrhythmia. An elevated extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o) concentration of 10.8 mM induced premature beats, a rapid beating rate (tachyarrhythmia), and chaotic or fibrillatory beating activity in a small group of myocytes. [Ca2+]i levels during systole increased from the nanomolar to micromolar concentration range before arrhythmia development. Spontaneous oscillations of [Ca2+]i during diastole could evoke a spontaneous tachyarrhythmia. In the presence of [Ca2+]i elevation, a spontaneous tachyarrhythmia could induce severe [Ca2+]i overload. Reduction of [Ca2+]i with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid AM (5 microM) in the presence of 10.8 mM [Ca2+]o reversed the arrhythmia. In single ventricular myocytes superfused with 10.8 mM [Ca2+]o, oscillations of membrane potential characteristic of transient inward current occurred that were prevented by ryanodine (0.1 microM), an inhibitor of Ca2+ flux across the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This study characterizes 1) an isolated multicellular myocyte model of arrhythmia similar to that evident in in vivo hearts, 2) elevation of [Ca2+]i with systolic [Ca2+]i levels of 1-3 microM and diastolic [Ca2+]i oscillations before the initiation of arrhythmia, 3) tachyarrhythmia as a cause of severe [Ca2+]i overload, which may be important in the perpetuation and degeneration of arrhythmias, and 4) reversal of arrhythmia with reduction of [Ca2+]i. The results in the isolated myocyte model may have relevance to the generation and perpetuation of certain cardiac arrhythmias associated with calcium overload.\r"

To test the hypothesis that such arrhythmias may be mediated by sarcolemmal stretch-activated channels, we attempted to inhibit stretch-induced arrhythmias with gadolinium (Gd3+), a potent stretch-activated channel blocker. In experiments with six isolated canine hearts, left ventricular volume was increased for 50 msec during early diastole and then returned to initial volume by a computerized servopump. The stretch volume was adjusted to yield a probability of eliciting a stretch-induced arrhythmia of 95 +/- 2% before treatment with Gd3+. When Gd3+ (1-10 microM) was administered, dose-dependent suppression of stretch-induced arrhythmias was observed. The probability of a stretch-induced arrhythmia was reduced to 13 +/- 10% (p less than 0.05) with 10 microM Gd3+. Washout of Gd3+ completely reversed this effect. Since Gd3+ is known to be a calcium channel antagonist, we compared the effect of Gd3+ on stretch-induced arrhythmias with that of verapamil and nifedipine. These calcium channel blockers produced no demonstrable inhibition of stretch-induced arrhythmias when administered at concentrations (1 microM) that substantially depressed left ventricular pressure development. Thus, our results indirectly implicate stretch-activated channels in the genesis of stretch-induced arrhythmias and provide preliminary evidence for a potential new mode of antiarrhythmic drug action--blockade of stretch-activated channels.\r"

Immunoreactive endothelin (irET) levels were significantly elevated in conditioned medium from bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (BPAE) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells when coincubated with washed human platelets. Platelets (approximately 200,000 cells/microliters) enhanced irET levels approximately 250% over basal levels. Stimulation of irET levels in BPAE cell-conditioned medium by platelets was time and platelet number dependent. Platelets, as well as thrombin and transforming growth factor-beta 1, stimulated the expression of preproendothelin-1 mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Coincubation of low doses of thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) and subthreshold concentrations of platelets with BPAE cells resulted in a further enhancement of irET levels in conditioned medium. Platelet-mediated stimulation of irET production was not significantly affected by indomethacin (1 microM) or the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist WEB 2086 (1 microM); however, coincubation of endotoxin (100 ng/ml) with platelets and BPAE cells resulted in significantly higher levels of irET. Whether direct contact or adhesion between platelets and endothelial cells is necessary for stimulating irET release was studied by separating platelets from BPAE cells with a 0.4 microns permeable membrane. Under these conditions, platelets still produced significant elevations (approximately 190% over basal levels) in irET levels in BPAE cell-conditioned medium. In addition, platelet-free buffer from agonist-induced platelet aggregation also significantly enhanced irET production (200% over basal values). These data indicate that a platelet-derived regulatory factor can induce the biosynthesis of endothelin from cultured endothelial cells and also suggest that platelets might play a role in vasomotor regulation via a novel intercellular interaction with the endothelium.\r"

This technique, unlike electrical methods, was able to provide uninterrupted recordings free of artifacts during defibrillation shocks. Optical recordings were made from sites on the ventricular epicardium of perfused rabbit hearts during electrical pacing. Continuous recordings of the electrophysiological responses of an intact heart to defibrillation threshold-strength shocks were made. It was shown that these shocks were able to stimulate normal-appearing action potentials in nonrefractory myocardium. A new and unexpected finding was that defibrillation threshold-strength shocks were also able to evoke a sustained, depolarizing response from myocardium already undergoing an action potential. This prolonged the time that the myocardium remained in the depolarized state. Prolongation of the depolarized state was accompanied by an equal prolongation of the refractory period. There was no indication that this depolarizing shock response was due to damage of the myocardium by the shock, to heterogeneous electrical responses in the optical recording area, or to the methods used in this study. It is hypothesized that these shocks were able to elicit a new action potential in already depolarized myocardium by hyperpolarizing portions of the myocardium's cellular membranes and, in so doing, to reactivate the fast sodium current. This effect, if prevalent in a fibrillating ventricle, could play a role in the defribillation process by effectively resynchronizing electrical activity.\r"

  ".W": "Fatty acid binding protein has been found in rat aortic endothelial cell membrane. It has been identified to be a 40-kDa protein that corresponds to a 40-kDa fatty acid binding protein with high affinity for a variety of long chain fatty acids isolated from rat heart myocytes. It is proposed that this endothelial membrane fatty acid binding protein might mediate the myocardial uptake of fatty acids. For evaluation of this hypothesis in vivo, influx kinetics of tracer-labeled fatty acids was examined in 15 normal subjects by scintigraphic techniques. Variation of the plasma fatty acid concentration and plasma perfusion rate has been achieved by modulation of nutrition state and exercise conditions. The clinical results suggest that the myocardial fatty acid influx rate is saturable by increasing fatty acid plasma concentration as well as by increasing plasma flow. For analysis of these data, functional relations describing fatty acid transport from plasma into myocardial tissue in the presence and absence of an \"unstirred layer\" were developed. The fitting of these relations to experimental data indicate that the free fatty acid influx into myocardial tissue reveals the criteria of a reaction on a capillary surface in the vicinity of flowing plasma but not of a reaction in extravascular space or in an unstirred layer and that the fatty acid influx into normal myocardium is a saturable process that is characterized by the quantity corresponding to the Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, and the maximal velocity, Vmax, 0.24 +/- 0.024 mumol/g and 0.37 +/- 0.013 mumol/g(g.min), respectively. These data are compatible with a nondiffusional uptake process mediated by the initial interaction of fatty acids with the 40-kDa membrane fatty acid binding protein of cardiac endothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of leukocytes results in the release of a variety of vasoactive substances that may modulate vascular tone. We studied the effect of human polymorphonuclear (PMN) and mononuclear (MONO) leukocytes on quiescent femoral arteries in vitro. Arteries were obtained from normal and atherosclerotic cynomolgus monkeys. In normal arteries, stimulation of PMNs (3 and 5 x 10(6) cells/ml) with either thrombin (5 units/ml) or complement C5a (0.5 micrograms/ml) resulted in endothelium-independent contraction (approximately 25% of maximum contraction with 80 mM KCl). Vasocontraction was augmented in the presence of superoxide dismutase (150 units/ml) and was significantly impaired in the presence of the hydroxyl radical scavengers mannitol (20 mM) and deferoxamine (1 mM). Catalase (1,200 units/ml) or L-alanine (20 mM) did not modify this effect of PMNs. In contrast to PMNs, vasocontraction in response to MONOs was not altered by the addition of radical scavengers. Pretreatment of PMNs and MONOs with indomethacin (10 microM) or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (20 microM) did not influence vascular responses. Supernatant of thrombin-stimulated PMNs and MONOs also produced vasocontraction (approximately two thirds of the effect of intact cells). This vasocontractor factor (or factors) was heat stable (30 minutes, 95 degrees C) and had a molecular weight less than 1,000 as determined by ultrafiltration. Stimulation of MONOs or PMNs (3 and 5 x 10(6) cells/ml) produced a similar response in normal arteries. In contrast, the constrictor response in atherosclerotic arteries to MONOs (5 x 10(6) cells/ml) was significantly greater than to PMNs. We conclude that stimulated human PMNs and MONOs contract arteries in vitro by release of at least two factors. One factor appears to be heat stable, with a molecular weight less than 1,000. The vascular response to PMNs, but not to MONOs, appears to involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The response to MONOs is greater than the response to PMNs in atherosclerotic, but not in normal, arteries.\r"

Hearts were equilibrated with Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 10 minutes and then loaded with copper by way of perfusion with buffer containing 20 microM copper(II)-bis-histidial for 30 minutes. Control hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer alone during the loading period. Hearts than were washed with buffer for 10 minutes and subjected to 20 minutes of normothermic global ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed a 67% increase in total copper content in loaded hearts by the end of the wash. By the end of the 30-minute period of reperfusion, control hearts demonstrated a 50-60% recovery of myocardial function as determined by peak systolic pressure, contractility, and heart rate. In contrast, copper-loaded hearts exhibited virtually no functional recovery within the 30-minute time period. Using salicylate as a probe, we determined that peak and duration of .OH formation appears to be increased in copper-loaded hearts during reperfusion. Furthermore, efflux of lactic dehydrogenase was significantly increased in copper-loaded hearts. Our results clearly demonstrate that increasing cardiac content of copper results in enhanced postischemic reperfusion injury associated with increased formation of .OH, thus suggesting an important catalytic role for this transition metal.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance), 24 hour urinary protein loss and serum albumin concentration did not significantly differ at the end of the two diet periods, indicating that long-term restriction of protein intake does not modify GFR or urinary protein loss in nephrotic patients.

Renal histology showed a necrotizing, crescentic glomerulonephritis in all patients. Despite advanced renal disease on admission cyclophosphamide, steroids (in 13 patients) and plasma exchange (in 9 patients) caused a rapid and sustained improvement of renal function. Four patients required intermittent hemodialysis over a period of one week. After 2 weeks of treatment serum creatinine values below 2 mg/dl (n = 4) indicated a nearly complete recovery of renal function in the long-term follow up (mean serum creatinine achieved after 12 months therapy: 1.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (n = 4). Therefore serum creatinine values observed after 2 weeks of therapy, appear to be of prognostic value with regard to renal outcome. No relapse of active WG or progressive renal deterioration was observed during follow-up (22 +/- 13 months) except in one patient with persisting renal impairment. Three patients died (staphylococcus sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage during hypertensive crisis, pulmonary embolism) during the first two months of therapy. The decline of serum creatinine seemed to be a better indicator of successful therapy than the decrease of anticytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hematuria. On admission ANCA titer neither correlated with serum creatinine, the degree of renal involvement, nor was it of prognostic value. ANCA, serum creatinine and hematuria normalized within 2 to 8 months, whereas ESR and proteinuria remained elevated. Our data indicate a good prognosis of WG even with advanced renal involvement and generalized vasculitis provided aggressive treatment is performed early.\r"

The development of assays for specific proteins in urine has produced a non-invasive solution to this problem. In 55 renal transplant patients the following proteins were determined daily in 24 h-urine samples: IgG, transferrin (TF), albumin, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG), retinol binding protein (RBP), alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1-MG) and alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT). All proteins were determined quantitatively using immunoluminometric assays and 10 microliters urine in dilutions from 1:1-1:100. The urinary protein excretion was related to the actual creatinine clearance as this index gave the best differentiation between normal and abnormal status. In 24 h-urine, intraindividual peaks of IgG, TF and albumin were seen regularly in acute rejection episodes. However, a peak in the \"tubular\" proteins (RBP, beta 2-MG, alpha 1-MG) could not be detected. After effective treatment of the rejection episode, the renal function improved and the protein excretion returned to prerejection episode levels. In bacterial infection of the urogenital tract, urinary alpha1-AT levels rose. They returned to normal after successful antibiotic treatment. In two cases of cyclosporin toxicity neither glomerular nor tubular proteins were excreted in abnormal amounts when compared with transplant patients without complications, the only changes being an increase in serum creatinine as a result of reduced renal function.\r"

The family had previously been known to have a \"familial\" renal disease, but came to attention through an isolated episode of gout in the propositus when renal function was already impaired. A reduced GFR was found in three of the other six subjects. Hyperuricemia associated with a grossly reduced fractional uric acid clearance (Cur/Ccr x 100) was present in the propositus and five kindred members, three of whom were children. The finding of this abnormality in two subjects with normal GFR suggests that this apparent hallmark of the disease precedes the onset of renal damage. The results confirm the dominant nature of the disorder, and highlight the need to investigate all kindred members of patients with juvenile gout and renal failure. Early recognition is important, since allopurinol therapy in doses adjusted to the reduced renal function may ameliorate the progression of the renal lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Nutritional status was assessed in 25 anemic hemodialysis patients before and during erythropoietin treatment. Nutritional assessment included regular blood chemistry determinations, anthropometric measurements, analysis of protein content in skeletal muscle, and estimation of daily protein intake from protein catabolic rate determinations (using urea kinetic modelling) and dialysis efficiency for urea. These measurements were done immediately prior to erythropoietin treatment, after anemia correction and after one year of maintenance erythropoietin treatment. Both relative body weights and subcutaneous fat stores were low at the start, but increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during the study. Sixteen of the 25 patients gained weight and eight patients lost weight. The patients with weight gain had at the start of the study low weight indices (body weight 89.9 +/- 7.6% of ideal body weight, body mass index 20.6 +/- 1.6), significantly (p less than 0.005) lower than the patients with weight loss. Although protein malnutrition was not obvious from arm anthropometrics, alkali soluble protein/DNA ratio or from serum albumin determinations, ASP/DNA ratio, increased in three of five patients investigated after one year on erythropoietin treatment. Neither protein catabolic rate nor dialysis efficiency changed significantly during the study. We conclude that anemia correction with erythropoietin has a positive effect on malnutrition in hemodialysis patients. In patients with underweight, an adjustment of fat stores was initially observed, followed possibly by an improvement in muscle protein content.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) treatment were prospectively investigated in 15 hemodialysis (HD) patients with severe anemia (hematocrit [Ht] 19.7 +/- 2.5%). Echocardiographic studies were performed after a midweek HD session just before and after a year of rhEPO. At the end of the study period, Ht had improved to 32.2 +/- 3.5% and cardiac index significantly decreased (5.48 +/- 1.54 vs 3.97 +/- 0.94 l/min/m2, p less than 0.001). Left ventricular mass index (LVMi) decreased with rhEPO (210.7 +/- 48.3 vs 139 +/- 50 g/m2, p less than 0.05). This decrease was concomitant with a decrease of LV end-diastolic diameter (4.89 +/- 0.44 vs 4.57 +/- 0.64 cm, p less than 0.05), interventricular septum thickness (IVST, 1.42 +/- 0.33 vs 1.07 +/- 0.13 cm, p less than 0.01) and LV posterior wall thickness (LVPWT, 1.28 +/- 0.21 vs 1.01 +/- 0.11 cm, p less than 0.01). Eight patients were hypertensive well controlled with hypotensive drugs (group I) and 7 normotensive (group II). LVMi was higher in group I than in group II before rhEPO (235.2 +/- 40 vs 182.7 +/- 43.1 g/m2, p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased after rhEPO in both groups (28.5% and 41.4% respectively). LVMi remained higher in group I than in group II at the end of the study (168.5 +/- 0.9 vs 106.7 +/- 24 g/m2, p less than 0.025). A moderately elevated IVST/LVPWT was reduced with a year of rhEPO (1.14 +/- 0.40 vs 1.05 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.05), disclosing correction of asymmetric septal hypertrophy. We conclude that left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) regression is obtained after partial correction of anemia with rhEPO. Previous hypertension with current need of antihypertensive treatment has also a significant effect in the development of LVH. Whether this regression would improve outcome in HD patients remains to be established.\r"

Most of the pancreatic tumors are ductal adenocarcinomas, which can be diagnosed cytologically. Occasionally, atypical ductal epithelium in chronic pancreatitis may mimic malignancy.

If laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with a much higher incidence of injuries to the bile duct than is traditional open cholecystectomy, its promise of decreasing pain, disability, and costs to patients undergoing cholecystectomy will be unfulfilled. The practicing general surgeon should learn laparoscopic techniques, since much of the future of abdominal surgery will ultimately reside in applying \"less invasive\" methods to perform standard operations. When embarking on a new procedure such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it is imperative that the surgeon remember the basis of his or her craft, primum non nocere.\r"

  ".W": "As tetanus has become a rare disease in the developed world, physicians have become less comfortable with its diagnosis and management. The extent of adequate antitetanus immunity in the adult population, especially the elderly, is waning, in great measure because primary care physicians have not made prophylaxis a priority in their routine encounters with patients. Furthermore, as the population of immunocompromised hosts grows, an increasing percentage of our patients may not respond to standard active immunization routines. Unless these trends are reversed, we face a substantial increase in the incidence of this dread disorder. Tetanus is also of interest as a relatively simple model of disordered motor control that can instruct us in the management of the many more common causes of neurogenic muscular rigidity. The toxin produced by Clostridium tetani finds increasing use in laboratories investigating brain function as well. Clinical tetanus is divided into four symptomatic types: generalized tetanus, local tetanus, cephalic tetanus, and neonatal tetanus. This monograph discusses the diagnostic aspects of each type of tetanus, its pathophysiology, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment. Preventing tetanus should be a high priority for all primary care physicians. Active immunization with tetanus toxoid is remarkably effective and safe. Passive immunization with human tetanus immune globulin is indicated in certain circumstances, which are discussed below.\r"

  ".W": "The rat uterine enzyme glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC) diesterase found in the proestrous secretions was purified and characterized biochemically with respect to its subunit mol wt, native size, pI, and amino acid and carbohydrate composition. The 30-kDa protein was assessed to have a native mol wt of 105 kDa, as determined by analytical gel filtration. It had a basic pI with an unusually high carbohydrate/protein ratio (0.83:1). The estrogen inducibility of the protein was identified by its de novo synthesis in vitro after in vivo 17 beta-estradiol administration. For this experiment, uteri from estradiol-treated immature rats were incubated in the presence of [14C]glucosamine, and the 14C-labeled total glycoconjugates were then subjected to the enzyme purification procedure. The peak enzyme fraction was observed to correspond to one of the 14C-labeled protein peaks in the elution profile of the glycoconjugates. Assay of GPC diesterase activity showed significant enhancement only in the uterus, not in other organ systems, after in vivo estradiol treatment, and this hormone-stimulated increase was inhibited by nafoxidine, a potent estrogen antagonist. The enzyme activity profile of the three main separated uterine cellular types showed that the enzyme was secreted by epithelial cells. No antigenic homology of the enzyme was observed with GPC diesterase from nonmammalian sources. The results suggested that GPC diesterase was one of the estrogen-regulated proteins of the preovulatory uterine fluid of rats, and the availability of a purified preparation of the enzyme could serve as a useful tool to study the mechanism of estrogen action.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hypophysectomy and hormonal replacement therapy on GH receptor (GH-R) gene expression was studied in rat adipose tissue with a cRNA probe corresponding to the amino-terminal of the hepatic GH-R. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 50-65 days of age, were used. In all fat depots tested (epididymal, retroperitoneal, and sc), two transcripts with an estimated size of 4.0 and 1.2 kilobases (kb), respectively, were detected. An intermediate-size transcript (2.6 kb) was sometimes observed. Also, isolated adipocytes and adipocyte precursor cells from the epididymal fat pad expressed these GH-R transcripts. The pituitary dependance of GH-R gene expression was analyzed in epididymal fat. Hypophysectomies were performed at 50 days of age, and the rats were then given replacement therapy with L-T4 (10 micrograms/kg.day) and hydrocortisone (400 micrograms/kg.day). Hypophysectomy decreased the abundance of both the 4.0 and the 1.2-kb transcripts, an effect that in part was restored by GH treatment. A solution hybridization RNase protection assay was then used to further characterize the effect of GH treatment of hypophysectomized rats on GH-R gene expression. A single injection of human GH (100 micrograms/rat) increased GH-R mRNA levels within 1 h, and maximal levels were reached between 3-12 h after the injection. The increase in GH-R mRNA levels was dose dependent and was observed also after prolonged treatment (1 or 5 mg/kg.day for 6 days) with bovine GH. These results confirm that GH-R mRNAs are present in rat adipose tissue from different fat depots. GH-R transcripts of the same estimated size were detected in isolated adipocytes and adipocyte precursor cells. Furthermore, the results show that there is a rapid and GH-dependent regulation of GH-R mRNA levels in adipose tissue.\r"

  ".W": "As in the rat, gastrin and an extract of the acid-producing part of the stomach (proventriculus) were found to lower the blood Ca2+ concentration in the chicken. Furthermore, gastrin enhanced the uptake of 45Ca into the femur. It has been suggested previously that gastrin causes hypocalcemia in the rat by releasing gastrocalcin, a hypothetical hormone thought to reside in the acid-producing part of the stomach. The results of the present study in the chicken are in agreement with this concept. Not only exogenous, but also endogenous gastrin lowered blood calcium levels. Thus, the serum gastrin concentration was increased in response to ranitidine-evoked blockade of the gastric acid output; the rise in gastrin was associated with a transient drop in blood calcium. Also, food intake produced a rise in the serum gastrin concentration and a transient drop in blood calcium. However, injection of ranitidine or food intake in proventriclectomized (acid-producing part of the stomach extirpated) chickens failed to lower blood calcium, supporting the view that the gastrin-evoked hypocalcemia depends upon an agent in the gastric (proventriculus) mucosa. We suggest that endogenous and exogenous gastrin evoke hypocalcemia in the chicken by the same mechanism as that which has been postulated in the rat, i.e. by mobilization of the candidate hormone gastrocalcin from endocrine cells in the acid-producing gastric mucosa.\r"

The results indicate that in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, E2 had a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on bone formation and mineralization at 10(-7) and 10(-9) M, with no effect on bone resorption. This effect was specific to bones from female mice and to E2, since 17-alpha-estradiol had no effect. Testosterone had similar effects specific to bones from male mice, resulting in the stimulation of bone formation and mineralization at 10(-7)- and 10(-9)-M concentrations. These effects were absent when serum-free medium was used. E2 and testosterone had an anabolic effect on endochondral and periosteal bone formation and mineralization, but no effect on bone resorption. This effect is dependent on the presence of a serum factor(s).\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown LH surges induced by physiological estradiol levels are invariably accompanied by robust and sustained GnRH surges in the ewe. Such an increase, however, has not been observed consistently during the preovulatory LH surge. In the present study, we examined GnRH secretion in Suffolk and Ile de France ewes during the preovulatory period using a method for pituitary portal blood collection which allows simultaneous portal and jugular blood samples to be taken at frequent intervals for up to 48 h. Ewes were sampled either during the mid-late luteal phase (n = 8) or follicular phase (n = 20). During the follicular phase, a robust increase in GnRH secretion occurred at the onset of the LH surge in 11 of 12 ewes sampled during the LH surge. The GnRH increase in most ewes was a massive surge, reaching values averaging 40-fold greater than baseline and extending well beyond the end of the preovulatory LH surge. In the single ewe not exhibiting a GnRH surge during the LH surge, postmortem inspection indicated blood was probably not sampled from the pituitary portal vessels. In the early follicular phase, GnRH-pulse frequency was greater than that observed in the luteal phase and, within the follicular phase, GnRH-pulse frequency increased further and amplitude decreased as the surge approached. These data demonstrate GnRH secretion leading up to ovulation in the ewe is dynamic, beginning with slow pulses during the luteal phase, progressing to higher frequency pulses during the follicular phase and invariably culminating in a robust surge of GnRH. The LH surge, however, ends despite continued elevation of GnRH.\r"

The total amount of GH released during the 8 days exceeded the initial content. The pituitary content of PRL remained unchanged after 8 days of culture. The number of weakly stained GH-immunoreactive (ir) cells was increased by day 4 in culture. The GH mRNA levels in individual cells as revealed by in situ hybridization were maintained at around the same level throughout culture. In contrast, the stainability of PRL-ir cells remained unchanged during culture, although the levels of PRL mRNA decreased by day 8. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry showed a decrease in the numbers of secretory granules and dilation of rough endoplasmic reticulum in GH-ir cells. GH synthesis, measured by incorporated [3H]leucine after GH immunoprecipitation, was elevated 120% on day 8 over day 0. The dominant control of GH and PRL secretion in rainbow trout seems to be the converse of those seen in mammals; inhibition for GH and stimulation for PRL.\r"

  ".W": "The placenta is a chimeric organ that produces all the components of the hypothalamic-pituitary GH axis. We propose that placental GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulates placental GH-like hormones which in turn stimulate production of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF-I and IGF-II, and these placental IGFs are important for growth and development of the placenta as well as the fetus. To test this hypothesis, pregnant rats were given either GHRH antisera or preimmune sera ip from days 7-19 of gestation. Fetuses were killed on day 19, and IGF-I and IGF-II tissue and serum concentrations in the mother and fetus were measured by RIA. IGF-II receptor content was measured by Western analysis. IGF-I and IGF-II messenger (m) RNA levels were measured in the placentas as well as in the fetal livers. The GHRH antibody titer was highest at day 19 of gestation but continued to be present through day 20 of postnatal development. Although placental weights did not differ, antibody-treated animals had higher placental IGF-I and IGF-II levels (I, 108 +/- 6 (SD); II, 126 +/- 5 ng/g, respectively) vs. control animals (I, 88 +/- 2.5 (SD); II, 48 +/- 11 ng/g) in pooled specimens. The IGF-II receptor was also up-regulated in placentas from antibody-treated mothers. The fetuses of antibody-treated (A) mothers were larger than the controls (C) (A, 2.615 g; C, 2.49 g, P less than 0.05). Levels of both IGFs were significantly increased in livers of antibody treated fetuses (IGF-I: A, 15 +/- 1 (SD); C, 12 +/- 0.8 ng/g; and IGF-II: A, 295 +/- 10 (SD); C, 233 +/- 10 (SD) ng/g). In addition, the concentration of the IGF-II receptor in liver of antibody-treated fetuses was also increased. Further, pooled fetal sera from antibody-treated fetuses had higher levels of IGF-II than controls (A, 950 ng/ml; C, 700 ng/ml), and the circulating IGF-II receptor was increased as measured by Western analysis. In the liver, IGF-II mRNA levels of antibody-treated fetuses were increased to 117% of controls, whereas IGF-I mRNA levels were undetectable. The placenta showed no increase in placental lactogen or GH mRNA, whereas IGF-II and GHRH mRNA were slightly increased in antibody-treated animals. In conclusion, these data suggest that GHRH may interact with the IGFs in a different fashion during prenatal development then during postnatal development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are present in extracellular fluids bound to specific, high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBPs are believed to mediate IGF transport to tissues and to modulate their actions on target cells. To determine whether IGF-I can modulate IGFBP concentrations in blood and to distinguish the effects of IGF-I from those of GH, we assessed serum IGFBP concentrations in four genotypically distinct groups of sibling transgenic (Tg) mice that differed in respect to their expression of IGF-I and GH. This unique physiological situation was created by crossing IGF-I Tg mice to GH-deficient, dwarf mice in whom somatotrophs were genetically ablated by the expression of a diphtheria toxin transgene in the somatotrophs. Because both Tg mouse lines are hemizygous for their respective transgene, progeny of the cross differ genotypically, according to whether or not they carry one or both transgenes, and phenotypically in regard to their relative expression of IGF-I and GH. GH-deficient mice showed a 15.7-fold decrease in serum IGF-I and a 5.5-fold decrease in serum IGFBP-3, but no change in a serum doublet band of 29,000 to 34,000 Mr, as assessed by ligand blotting. When IGF-I was expressed in the GH-deficient mice, serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were 69% and 64% of those in normal sera, respectively. The 29,000 to 34,000 Mr doublet bands also increased. The ternary 150 kilodalton IGF-IGFBP complex, however, was not restored, presumably because IGF-I has no influence on the expression of the acid-labile subunit in this complex. In mice with IGF-I overexpression, serum IGFBP-3 was increased 2.1-fold and the sum of the 29,000 to 34,000 doublet bands was increased 2.9-fold. Immunoblotting showed that the changes in the 29,000 to 34,000 Mr forms observed by ligand blotting appeared to be predominantly due to changes in IGFBP-2. The results show that IGF-I can induce IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2 independently of GH and that IGF-I is a major controller of these binding proteins.\r"

The characteristic increases in hypothalamic multiunit activity (MUA volleys) associated with each LH pulse measured in the peripheral circulation were of lower frequency during the luteal phase than in the follicular phase of the cycle. Multiunit activity volley frequency increased as functional luteolysis progressed and achieved maxima of approximately one volley per hour within the first few days of the follicular phase. Unexpectedly, a dramatic decline in pulse generator frequency was observed coincidentally with the initiation of the preovulatory LH surge. Evidence is presented to support the conclusion that this deceleration of pulse generator activity is the consequence of the preovulatory rise in plasma estrogen concentration. As reported in women, a significant reduction in GnRH pulse generator frequency was observed at night during the follicular phase, but not during the luteal phase, of the menstrual cycle.\r"

  ".U": "91339733\r", 
  ".W": "The progression from nonpregnancy through late lactation is associated with an increase in the proportion of anterior pituitary cells that secrete PRL and a comparable decrease in the percentage of cells that release GH. These fluctuations result from variations in both the number of cells that release GH or PRL alone and mammosomatotropes, cells that release both hormones concurrently. However, it has not been determined whether this reciprocal shift in PRL and GH secretors during the onset of lactation is readily reversible. In the present study, anterior pituitaries from adult virgin, late lactating, or postweaning female rats (4, 6, or 8 days) were dispersed with trypsin and subsequently assayed for PRL and GH release using reverse hemolytic plaque assays. We found that separating lactating females from their pups for only 4 days induced a reciprocal shift in the proportions of GH and PRL cells back to levels found in virgin females. Simultaneous plaque assays were then performed to determine whether this post-weaning shift in the percentages of GH and PRL secretors was due to changes in the abundance of cells that secrete each hormone alone or in the proportion of mammosomatotropes. The overall changes in GH and PRL cell proportions consisted of variations only in the fraction of cells that secreted either GH or PRL alone; no differences were observed in the percentage of mammosomatotropes or in the overall abundance of acidophils. Our results demonstrate that the reciprocal shifts in the proportions of PRL- and GH-secreting cells associated with lactation are rapidly reversible. Moreover, these results are consistent with our hypothesis that PRL and GH secretors are functionally interconvertible and further suggest that this process is bidirectional.\r"

  ".W": "Reverse hemolytic plaque assays were performed on monodispersed pituitary cells from cattle at various stages of the estrous cycle in an attempt to determine whether short term fluctuations in the gonadal steroid milieu influenced the proportions of pituitary cells that released GH and/or PRL. Phase of the estrous cycle was initially determined by gross ovarian morphology and later confirmed by determination of estradiol-17 beta and progesterone peripheral serum concentrations. Animals were subdivided into four groups according to phase of cycle: early luteal (EL; day 1-10), midluteal (ML; day 11-16), late luteal (LL; day 17-19), and follicular (F; day 20-21). Plaque assays demonstrated that the percentage of all pituitary cells that released PRL was greater in the EL phase than during the ML or F phases, whereas the relative abundance of GH-secreting cells remained unchanged. A more critical analysis of hormone-secreting subtypes revealed that the increase in total PRL secretors could be attributed almost exclusively to an increase in the abundance of those cells that released both GH and PRL (mammosomatotropes). Accompanying this augmentation of dual hormone-secretors was a decrease in the proportion of cells that released GH alone without a change in the abundance of cells that secreted only PRL. These results strongly suggest that during the estrous cycle there is a bidirectional interconversion among cells that release only GH and mammosomatotropes. Moreover, the relationship between ratios of acidophilic subpopulations and stage of reproductive cycle indicates that ovarian steroids may regulate this phenomenon.\r"

  ".U": "91339738\r", 
  ".W": "Resident ovarian macrophages have long been recognized as potential in situ regulators of ovarian function, presumably through local paracrine secretion of regulatory molecules (i.e. cytokines). One such macrophage product, interleukin-1 (IL-1) has recently been shown to exert profound regulatory effects at the level of the ovarian granulosa cell. In this report, we examine the possibility that the adjacent theca-interstitial (androgen-producing) cell may also be a site of IL-1 reception and action. The basal accumulation of androsterone, the major androgenic steroid synthesized by whole ovarian dispersates from immature rats, in the presence of insulin (1 microgram/ml), increased 8- to 9-fold after treatment with human CG (1 ng/ml). Although IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta (10 ng/ml) by themselves were without effect on basal androsterone accumulation, both cytokines (IL-1 beta greater than IL-1 alpha) inhibited human CG hormonal action (in the presence of insulin) in a dose-dependent manner, the maximal inhibitory effect being 75%. Similar results were obtained when using highly purified theca-interstitial cells derived from the same animal model suggesting that IL-1-attenuated androgen biosynthesis is due, at least in part, to IL-1 acting directly at the level of the theca-interstitial cells. The IL-1 effect proved relatively specific since all other known interleukins (IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6) were without effect. Moreover, IL-1 beta action was effectively immunoneutralized when concurrently applied with anti-IL-1 beta (but not nonimmune) sera. Significantly, the antigonadotropic action of IL-1 could not be accounted for by a decrease in the viable cell mass. Tracer studies with radiolabeled steroid substrates suggested that IL-1-attenuated ovarian androsterone accumulation is due, if only in part, to inhibition of transformations catalyzed by (theca-interstitial) 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17:20 lyase, stimulation of theca-interstitial (or granulosa 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-mediated conversions, or both. Taken together, these findings indicate that relatively low concentrations of IL-1, possibly originating from somatic ovarian cells or resident ovarian macrophages, are capable of exerting an inhibitory effect upon gonadotropin-supported androgen production. As such, these and previous observations suggest that intraovarian IL-1 may play a dual regulatory role in the developing ovarian follicle by targeting both the granulosa and theca-interstitial cells as its sites of action.\r"

  ".U": "91339739\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of secretagogue(s) from mouse decidual tissue on the release of mouse placental lactogen-II (mPL-II) were studied. Decidual tissue was obtained from 10- and 11-day-pregnant mice. The tissue was homogenized, extracted, and the tissue extract was made 50% saturated with ammonium sulfate. Both the precipitate and supernatant were tested for their ability to stimulate mPL-II release from cultured trophoblasts. The supernatant contained an activity to stimulate the release of mPL-II. This activity was further purified using column chromatography. The purification resulted in isolation of a protein with a mol wt of 20 K as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and 6 K under reducing conditions. Further characterization of this protein showed that it binds calcium and has an amino acid sequence that is highly homologous with calcyclin expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and with calcyclin from other species. This protein was designated mouse decidual calcyclin. Antiserum was raised against the purified decidual calcyclin for development of an RIA and for immunoblots. Western blots of various mouse tissue extracts and mouse serum from different physiological stages showed that the concentration of calcyclin was highest in decidual tissue. Detectable levels were found in extracts from trophoblast, lung, and stomach, but the concentrations in these tissues were about 100 times lower than in decidua. Decidual calcyclin was not detectable in mouse serum. Cultured decidual cells released calcyclin into the medium. On average, this release was about 7.8 ng/micrograms DNA.24 h. The rate of release did not change significantly during 4 days of culture. The ratio of calcyclin in cells per calcyclin released during 24 h averaged 2.3 and did not change significantly during the culture period. The purified decidual calcyclin stimulated the release of mPL-II from cultured trophoblasts in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations from 0.01 to 1 microgram/ml. The maximum stimulation averaged about 1.5 times above control. It is concluded that decidual calcyclin may be of physiological importance for the regulation of mPL-II secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin-II (AII) receptors and their coupling to signaling transduction systems were studied in fetal skin fibroblasts using the receptor subtype-specific antagonists Dup753 (type 1) and PD123177 (type 2). In primary cultures, total binding per cell remained constant from days 2-6 of culture, but after subculture levels were initially decreased, then increased until the cells reached confluence. In freshly isolated cells more than 90% of the receptors were type 2, and only a minor fraction were type 1, findings that are consistent with autoradiographic analyses and membrane binding assays. The proportions tended to reverse during culture, with type 1 receptors accounting for 60-80% and type 2 for 20-40% by day 6 of culture. In secondary culture, subtype 1 was about 50% on day 1 and increased to 70% by day 6. At subsequent passages, the proportion of receptor subtypes remained constant up to 6 days, with 90% being of the type 1 variety and 10% of type 2. Scatchard analysis of binding in the presence of the selective antagonists showed similar binding affinities for both subtypes, and the changes in receptor subtype during culture were due primarily to changes in receptor number. Treatment of primary cultures with actinomycin-D for 24 h prevented the transition from AII receptor type 2 to type 1 by increasing the absolute number of type 2 receptors, suggesting that receptor synthesis is regulated at the posttranscriptional level. Stimulation of the cells with 100 nM AII resulted in increases in inositol phosphate accumulation, an effect that was prevented by the type 1 antagonist, but not by the type 2 antagonist. In contrast with other systems in which AII inhibits adenylate cyclase, in fetal fibroblasts AII stimulate cAMP production. The increases in cAMP were more pronounced in secondary cultures in which type 1 receptor content is higher, and the effect was prevented by the type 1, but not the type 2, antagonists. These findings demonstrate the presence of both AII receptor subtypes in fetal fibroblasts, but only the type 1 receptors are coupled to a known intracellular signalling system. The changes in AII receptor subtypes may be the consequence of alterations in intercellular communication, endocrine, or paracrine factors during culture.\r"

  ".W": "There is clear evidence for communication between the immune and neuroendocrine systems. However, the effect of cytokines as major immune mediators on the hypothalamic growth peptides, GHRH and somatostatin (SRIH), is not well established. To investigate a possible hypothalamic action of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, on the release of GHRH and SRIH, we used a previously validated acute rat hypothalamic explant system. IL-1 caused a pronounced dose-dependent stimulation of SRIH in the dose-range 1-100 U/ml (P less than 0.01). GHRH showed a slight, but significant, increase in response to IL-1 tested in the dose-range 10-100 U/ml. Similar studies with mediobasal hypothalamic (GHRH and SRIH) or median eminence (SRIH) fragments produced no change in either GHRH or SRIH release. The effects of IL-1 were antagonized by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 micrograms/ml). Stimulation of GHRH and SRIH could not be blocked by the CRH-antagonist alpha-helical CRH (9-41) at 10(-6) M. Interleukin-6, in the dose range 10-100 U/ml, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, in the dose range 10-10,000 U/ml, had no effect on the acute hypothalamic release of either GHRH or SRIH. It is concluded that IL-1 stimulates the acute hypothalamic release of GHRH and SRIH, and that this effect is mediated by cyclo-oxygenase products. The marked IL-1 stimulation of hypothalamic SRIH release may override the minor increase of GHRH increase, and may thus contribute to disturbances in growth seen in the presence of chronic inflammation.\r"

BDNF has been shown to promote the survival of neurons located in or directly connected with the CNS and is likely to function in adjusting the cell number within neuronal populations to the need of this projection field. Here we describe the primary structure of a human BDNF cDNA, the biological activities of pure recombinant human BDNF, and the tissue distribution of rat BDNF. BDNF mRNA can be found in some peripheral tissues as well as in the CNS, and recombinant human BDNF is a potent neurotrophic factor for primary peripheral sensory neurons.\r"

  ".U": "91339744\r", 
  ".W": "Studies were performed to test the hypothesis that the rapid decline in estradiol (E2) levels on proestrus before ovulation was due to a reduction in androgen substrate for aromatase, and that this decline in androgen was regulated by an estrogen receptor-mediated mechanism. Aromatase activity, concentrations of E2, androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), and progesterone (P4) in follicular, corpora lutea, and ovarian homogenates as well as peripheral E2, A, P4, and LH were measured in cycling rats from 1400-2000 h on proestrus. These parameters were also recorded after the expected E2 surge in animals treated at 1900 h on diestrous day 2 with the antiestrogen keoxifene (20 mg/kg), with or without an ovulatory dose of PMSG at 1600 h on proestrus. In a second experiment, P-450-17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (P-450(17 alpha] activity was measured in a group of control rats at 1500, 1700, and 1900 h. Aromatase activity remained unchanged, even though serum and ovarian E2 levels were reduced from peak values at 1500 h to basal values at 1800 h (P less than 0.01). Peripheral A as well as ovarian androgens (specifically follicular but not luteal) A and T were also reduced over this time period (P less than 0.01). Although total ovarian P4 remained unchanged, follicular levels rose from 1400-2000 h (P less than 0.01). These reductions in androgens and E2 levels coincided with a marked reduction in follicular P-450(17 alpha) activity. Treatment with keoxifene with or without PMSG prevented the fall in peripheral E2 and A and the increase in peripheral P4 seen in controls. Ovarian and follicular E2, A, and to a lesser extent T were also remained at values similar to those during the E2 surge. Follicular P4 was reduced by both treatments. Neither treatment had any effect on aromatase. These results indicate that the fall in peripheral and ovarian E2 levels before ovulation was due to a decline in aromatizable androgen, through an inhibition of follicular P-450(17 alpha) enzyme activity, which appears to be mediated by an estrogen receptor-regulated mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent inhibitor of Leydig cell function. We have reported that IL-1 inhibited hCG-induced cAMP and testosterone formation. In the present study we evaluated the effect of IL-1 on Leydig cell cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc) mRNA levels. P450scc is the rate-limiting enzyme for Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Highly purified Leydig cells were prepared from adult Sprague-Dawley male rats (55-65 day-old) using the combination of elutriation and Percoll gradient. Purified Leydig cells were then cultured with or without IL-1 beta (1-100 ng/ml) and recombinant human monocyte-derived IL-1 receptor antagonist (250 ng/ml) for 24 h. hCG (10 ng/ml), 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1 mM), or 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate was then added, and cultures were continued for an additional 6 h. P450scc mRNA levels of Leydig cells were very low to undetectable after 24 h in culture and could be stimulated by the addition of either hCG (10 ng/ml) or 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1 mM), but the addition of 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate had no effect. P450scc mRNA levels increased as early as 2 h after the addition of hCG. Furthermore, cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml) markedly blocked hCG-induced P450scc mRNA expression. This indicates that synthesis of a labile new protein(s) is required for the induction of P450scc mRNA by hCG. IL-1 beta inhibited hCG-stimulated testosterone formation and P450scc mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of IL-1 beta could be reversed by the concomitant addition of IL-1 receptor antagonist. Our results suggest that P450scc mRNA levels of Leydig cells are modulated by IL-1. This may be one mechanism that could explain the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on Leydig cell steroidogenesis.\r"

When both peptides were administered iv, CRF-induced hypotension and tachycardia were completely prevented by an antagonist:agonist ratio of 6:1, whereas total blockade of CRF-induced elevations of plasma ACTH and beta-endorphin levels required an antagonist:agonist ratio of 3000:1. These results demonstrate marked differences in the ability of alpha-helical CRF9-41 to antagonize various biological actions of CRF and support the existence of multiple CRF receptor subtypes.\r"

  ".U": "91339747\r", 
  ".W": "Compared to corticotropes in the adult rat anterior pituitary, neonatal corticotropes exhibit a significantly lower extent of conversion of precursor molecules into ACTH and a substantially greater extent of ACTH cleavage into smaller product peptides similar in size to alpha-melanotropin and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide (CLIP). In the present study we examined pro-ACTH/endorphin (PAE; also called POMC) processing in corticotropes at different times during postnatal development to determine when these cells cease cleaving ACTH into smaller peptides and when they cease accumulating large amounts of intact precursor in vivo. The pattern of processing observed in the newborn is maintained through the second week after birth. A dramatic decrease in ACTH cleavage occurs between the second and third postnatal weeks. The extent of precursor cleavage increases toward the adult pattern by the fifth postnatal week. Explants of newborn anterior pituitary were previously shown to exhibit increased cleavage of ACTH into ACTH-(1-13)NH2 and CLIP, a process that was suppressed by glucocorticoids. To determine whether corticotropes from older animals maintained this plasticity and what intercellular interactions might be required, dissociated primary cultures were maintained in complete serum-free medium with or without added glucocorticoids. After 7 days in complete serum-free medium, the cellular content of both intact precursor and peptides the size of CLIP was increased compared to the corresponding in vivo pattern for animals from birth through adulthood. Although corticotropes from younger animals exhibited more pronounced changes when placed in culture, even cultures from adult animals exhibited some ACTH cleavage. For corticotrope cultures prepared from animals up to postnatal day 15, chronic treatment with dexamethasone did not suppress ACTH cleavage activity, although glucocorticoids did suppress ACTH cleavage in cultures from animals older than postnatal day 22. Biosynthetic labeling studies with cultures from 4- to 5-week-old rats demonstrated that the powerful suppressive effect of dexamethasone on the cleavage of newly synthesized ACTH-(1-39) was only evident 24 h after addition of the glucocorticoid to the culture medium. In contrast, removal of dexamethasone allowed cleavage of ACTH to commence within a few hours.\r"

Staining was observed over nuclei of epithelial cells of the Mullerian duct and over nuclei of cells of the developing connective tissue (mesenchymal cells) of the reproductive tract on fetal day 15. By day 17 when a primitive uterus could be distinguished, ERs were detected in nuclei of mesenchymal cells, but in only a small portion of epithelial cells. A different pattern of immunocytochemical staining was observed in uteri from animals killed on the day of birth; cells of the connective tissue contained ER, but the epithelial cells did not. By 4 or 6 days after birth, more nuclei in the connective tissue stained for ER with a greater intensity compared to nuclear staining in epithelial cells. ERs were detectable in nuclei of both uterine epithelial cells and connective tissue cells on days 10 and 19 after birth.\r"

  ".W": "The maintenance of optimal steroidogenesis in adrenocortical cells primarily depends on the chronic action of cAMP. Herein we examine the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on the differentiated functions of bovine adrenocortical (BAC) cells in primary culture. PGE2 (10 microM) treatment for 3 h stimulated steroidogenesis and cAMP production by over 100-fold. In addition, the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMP (1 mM) inhibited PGE2 stimulation of steroidogenesis by 60%. This observation suggests that the cAMP second messenger system is responsible for much of the PGE2-activated steroid hormone synthesis. Chronic treatment of BAC cells with PGE2 caused induction of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and steroid 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 expression as determined by the examination of enzyme activity, enzyme levels by immunoblotting, and specific messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by Northern analysis. The positive effects of PGE2 on expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 were similar to the effects seen after ACTH treatment of BAC cells. In addition, treatment of BAC cells with PGE2 for 3 days caused a 3-fold induction of ACTH receptors as determined by increased cell binding of [125I]ACTH. Finally, we determined that BAC cells produced PGE2 and that the level of synthesis increased 10-fold after treatment with the hormone angiotensin II. Taken together these data indicate that PGE2 is a positive regulator of BAC cell differentiation acting on ACTH receptors, steroid metabolizing enzymes, and steroidogenesis. The ability of BAC cells to produce PGE2 leaves open the possibility for paracrine and autocrine regulation within the adrenal.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has been shown to stimulate biosynthesis of progesterone and other differentiated functions of granulosa cells. The presence of the IGF-I receptor messenger RNA and IGF-I receptor as well as the role of IGF-I in the amplification of gonadotropin action in luteinized rat ovarian cells were assessed in the present study. Rat ovarian luteal tissue were obtained on day 6 of pseudopregnancy. After collagenase dispersion, luteal cells were cultured with or without IGF-I for 72 h in a serum-free medium in the absence or presence of human CG (100 ng/ml), 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM), and 25-OH cholesterol (30 micrograms/ml). IGF-I alone increased (P less than 0.01) progesterone secretion 47% over controls. When combined with hCG the increase in progesterone secretion was enhanced 6-fold (P less than 0.001) over controls. The effects of 8 bromo-cAMP on progesterone secretion also was amplified (P less than 0.001) when IGF-I was present in the medium. When 25-OH cholesterol, a diffusable substrate for steroidogenesis, was included in the incubation medium along with IGF-I, progesterone secretion was enhanced significantly (P less than 0.01) over controls and either treatment alone. Binding studies performed with ovarian luteal cell membranes in the ovary revealed a dissociation constant of 0.94 nM for the IGF-I receptor. Autoradiograms from affinity labeling studies revealed a band corresponding to 132 Kd which is characteristic for the alpha-subunit of the type I IGF receptor. Northern blot analysis showed the presence of a major transcript at approximately 11 kilobases, which agrees with the size of the IGF-I receptor messenger RNA. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the fact that IGF-I regulates differentiated functions of the corpus luteum through interaction with specific high affinity IGF-I receptors.\r"

  ".U": "91339751\r", 
  ".W": "The Madin-Darby bovine kidney cell line was used to examine regulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) synthesis by epithelial cells. Ligand and immunoblot analysis of conditioned media indicated that IGFBP-2 was the predominant IGFBP secreted by untreated cells. Treatment with forskolin decreased secretion of IGFBP-2 by 75 +/- 3% and induced the appearance of IGFBP-3 and 24,000 Mr IGFBP. Although insulin alone did not induce the appearance of either band, in the presence of forskolin it increased the IGFBP-3 and 24,000 Mr bands 4.2 +/- 1.1 and 7.3 +/- 0.9-fold, respectively, above the values for forskolin treatment alone. Exposure to forskolin resulted in a 3-fold decrease in the abundance of IGFBP-2 messenger RNA (mRNA), and a 30-fold increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA. An additional 2- to 3-fold increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA was observed when cells were treated with insulin plus forskolin. Treatment with insulin plus forskolin increased cell number 2-fold, compared to small increases (26%) observed with forskolin treatment alone. Since treatment with IGF-I or -II did not result in similar responses to those of insulin, IGF analogs with differing affinities for IGFBP and IGF type I receptor were tested. B-chain IGF-I (decreased affinity for IGFBP) increased cell number and enhanced forskolin's effects on IGFBP-3 secretion and mRNA abundance to the same extent as insulin, whereas [Leu24,1-62]IGF-I (decreased affinity for the type I IGF receptor) did not. Therefore, activation of the type I IGF receptor was required to elicit increases in cell number and IGFBP synthesis and secretion, and the actions of IGF-I and II were likely blocked by binding to the large amounts of IGFBP-2 that were secreted. These results are in direct contrast to studies with human fibroblasts in which IGF-I and [Leu24,1-62]IGF-I stimulate IGFBP-3 secretion, whereas B-chain IGF-I has only a minimal effect. The ability to differentially regulate secretion of different forms of IGFBPs by epithelial cells and the finding that regulation is distinct from that of fibroblasts may have important implications for understanding mechanisms by which IGFs and IGFBPs interact to regulate epithelial cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "The role of signal transduction systems was examined in the secretion of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (SS) from perifused rat hypothalamic fragments. Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, stimulated the release of GHRH and SS in a concentration-dependent manner (10-100 microM) with greatest stimulation for GHRH at 100 microM (mean +/- SE, 249 +/- 14%) and for SS at 30 microM (172 +/- 18%). (Bu)2cAMP also augmented GHRH and SS release. The protein kinase-C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not significantly stimulate basal GHRH or SS release at concentrations of 10 nM to 1 microM. The calcium ionophore A23187 enhanced the release of GHRH and SS in a concentration-dependent manner (2-20 microM), with the greatest responses of 282 +/- 50% at 10 microM and 189 +/- 24% at 20 microM, respectively. Potentiation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate of forskolin-stimulated GHRH and SS release was observed. A23187 at 10 microM did not enhance forskolin-stimulated GHRH release, but did potentiate forskolin-stimulated SS release in a more than additive response. We conclude that there is 1) cAMP stimulation of hypothalamic GHRH and SS release, 2) a modulating role of protein kinase-C on cAMP-stimulated release of GHRH and SS, 3) a stimulatory role of the calcium messenger system for GHRH and SS release, 4) interaction of the signal pathways with differences in net GHRH and SS responses, and 5) a modulatory effect of protein kinase-C in perifused hypothalamic fragments which differs from the stimulation of basal GHRH and SS release reported in fetal-derived hypothalamic cell cultures. Our observations suggest an important regulatory role of interacting signal transduction systems in the hypothalamic secretion of GHRH and SS.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone to the rat liver cytosol glucocorticoid receptor was inhibited by physiological concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids as a function of increasing dose, degree of unsaturation, and chain length of the fatty acid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were the most potent inhibitors. Scatchard analysis and Line-weaver-Burk plots of the binding data revealed that both the association constants and number of binding sites decreased and that polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibition was of a mixed non-competitive type. The dissociation rate constant of [3H]dexamethasone from glucocorticoid receptors was increased by up to 10 times in the presence of docosahexaenoic acid, whereas a competitive inhibitor like the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486 had no effect. Moreover, sucrose density gradient analysis showed that docosahexaenoic acid inhibited the binding of [3H] dexamethasone to both the 8.8S and 4S forms. The results strongly suggest that unsaturated fatty acids are interacting at a site on the receptor different from the hormone binding site and the heat shock protein and that by binding to a second site unsaturated fatty acids greatly change the conformation of the hormone binding site to reduce its affinity for the hormone, either partially or completely depending on the concentration and the class of the fatty acid.\r"

More than 90% of the total activity was located in the cytosol, but the specific enzyme activity was highest in the microsomal fraction. The relative rates of activity with various substrates (CoQ0 approximately equal to durohydroquinone greater than menadione greater than duroquinone greater than CoQ6 = CoQ10 greater than ferricyanide) were similar to those described previously for quinone reductase from liver Dicumarol, chlorpromazine, and T3 were much more potent inhibitors of the enzyme when NADPH was the coenzyme than when NADH was the coenzyme. Dicumarol was the most potent inhibitor. The enzyme was not inhibited by rotenone. Islets ranked second to liver in quinone reductase activity, but the activity in islets was much closer to that found in all other tissues examined.

  ".W": "The substrate behavior of synthetic N-sulfonated iodothyronines (iodothyronine sulfamates, TiNS) for the type I deiodinase was compared with that of the naturally occurring 4'-O-sulfonated iodothyronines (iodothyronine sulfates, TiS), which have been shown to be deiodinated 40-200 times more efficiently than the native iodothyronines. Deiodination was studied in incubations of rat liver microsomes with unlabeled or 3' (5')-125I-labeled T4NS, rT3NS, T3NS, and 3,3'-T2NS at 37 C and pH 7.2 in the presence of 5 mM dithiothreitol. Reaction products were analyzed by RIA or Sephadex LH-20 and HPLC. Kinetic studies were performed under initial reaction rate conditions to determine the apparent Michaelis Menten (Km) constants and maximum velocity values. In contrast to T4S, which is converted only by inner ring deiodination (IRD), T4NS underwent both IRD and outer ring deiodination (ORD), similar to T4, but more rapidly. At 10 nM T4NS substrate, T3NS was the major product observed, while no rT3NS accumulated due to its rapid conversion to 3,3'-T2NS. At least one third of the 3,3'-T2NS was converted by IRD, unlike 3,3'-T2 which is a pure ORD substrate. The type I deiodination efficiencies of T4NS IRD and ORD were 17-fold higher than with T4, mainly due to approximately 32-fold lower apparent Km values. Deiodination of rT3, the preferred type I substrate, was not improved by sulfamation. T3NS and 3,3'-T2NS were deiodinated 4-10 times more efficiently than T3 and 3,3'-T2, respectively, due to 2- to 4-fold decreases in apparent Km values with a concomitant doubling of maximum velocity values. N-Sulfonation stimulates type I deiodination to a similar extent as other side-chain modifications that eliminate the positive charge of the nitrogen (e.g. iodothyroacetic acids). However, the effects are less dramatic than those induced by 4'-sulfation with respect to both efficiency and specificity of the catalytic process.\r"

  ".W": "The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a recognized model for studying immunologically-mediated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The disease appears with a greater preponderance in females than in males. Castration at weaning led to a significant increase in the prevalence of diabetes in NOD males, whereas a tendency to a decreased prevalence was observed in NOD females. Castration combined with thymectomy was found to further increase the prevalence of diabetes in NOD males, whereas in females castration reversed the effect of thymectomy. These results on changes in diabetes prevalence were corroborated by the degree of lymphocytic infiltration directed toward the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Taken together these results indicate a direct relationship between the endocrine and immune systems, whereby orchidectomy has a deleterious effect on the immunopathogenesis of diabetes. In addition, we examined whether the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations, mitogen reactivity, lymphokine production, and in vivo response to a thymus-dependent antigen, such as sheer red blood cell, were dependent or independent of the sex steroid environment.\r"

  ".W": "A hybrid gene comprising the bovine thyroglobulin gene promoter and the coding region for the simian virus-40 large T- and small t-antigens was used to generate 30 transgenic mice by microinjection into the pronuclei of single cell embryos. All animals except three developed, as single primitive pathology, a dramatic enlargement of the thyroid gland. Compression of trachea and esophagus, accompanied by dyspnea, inspiratory stridor, and dysphagia, led to a progressive cachexia and premature death attributed to respiratory failure. Despite the large thyroid volume, T4 levels were abnormally low, and the progression of the syndrome could be delayed by a substitutive treatment with thyroid hormones. The rapid evolution of the disease, leading to the death of most founder transgenic animals before the breeding age, prevented transmission of the transgene to their offspring. Only two transgenic lines are presently surviving. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissues revealed a specific expression of the simian virus-40 antigens in the thyroid cells. Hyperplasia was already obvious at birth. Older animals displayed moderately to poorly differentiated thyroid adenocarcinomas. Electron microscopy revealed, however, the persistence of cell polarity and the presence of microfollicles between the densely packed cells. Cell lines derived from these large T-expressing thyroids were shown to have lost expression of both thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase, while expressing low levels of TSH receptors. These transgenic mice could constitute an interesting model of aggressive adenocarcinoma, sharing phenotypical similarities with the anaplastic type of human thyroid tumors.\r"

  ".W": "A dwarf transgenic mouse (DTM) line has been established in which mice express relatively high levels of a mutated bovine (b) GH gene. This bGH analog binds to mouse liver membrane preparations with an affinity similar to that of wild-type bGH. The mean growth ratio of these mice is approximately 0.7 relative to that of their nontransgenic littermates. Serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels of DTM were found to be approximately half those in nontransgenic littermates. Liver GH receptor levels were up-regulated in DTM or wild-type bGH transgenic mice. Pituitary GH levels were negatively correlated with serum IGF-I concentrations. Wild-type bGH transgenic mice contain relatively high serum IGF-I and low pituitary GH levels, whereas DTM possess low serum IGF-I and high pituitary GH levels. The decrease in serum IGF-I resulting from the interaction between the bGH analog, the endogenous mouse GH, and GH receptor(s) apparently leads to a dwarf phenotype. These data suggest that this bGH analog has uncoupled GH ligand-receptor binding from IGF-I production and acts as a functional antagonist to the action of endogenous mGH.\r"

By contrast, only 11% of the testes failed to descend when blocked by 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors during the same period. Flutamide administration over narrower time intervals (gestational day 13-15, 16-17, or 18-19) revealed maximal interference with testicular descent after androgen inhibition during gestational days 16-17. No significant differences in testicular or epididymal weights were evident between descended and undescended testes; furthermore, no correlation was detected between the presence of epididymal abnormalities and testicular descent. These findings indicate that androgen inhibition during a brief period of embryonic development can block testicular descent. The mechanism through which this inhibition occurs remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".U": "91339760\r", 
  ".W": "During the third week of postnatal life, dramatic ontogenic changes occur in the morphology and enzymology of the small intestine of the infant rat, enabling the animal to make the transition from milk to solid food. To investigate the roles of T4 and GH in regulation of these changes, infant rats were hypophysectomized on day 6 of life by the transauricular technique. Hypophysectomy resulted in diminution of somatic and intestinal growth as well as abnormal maturation of the disaccharidases lactase, sucrase, and maltase when measured on day 25. Administration of either T4 or GH to hypophysectomized animals resulted in moderately increased intestinal growth, while complete restoration of small intestinal growth resulted from administration of the combination of both hormones. Although T4, GH, or the combination of hormones reduced lactase activities, T4 alone produced normal maturation of sucrase and maltase. Neither hypophysectomy nor hormone replacement affected aminooligopeptidase. The molecular structure of lactase, analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was not altered to a major degree in hypophysectomized animals or animals that received hormone replacement, but minor alterations were evident in sucrase structure in hypophysectomy. These studies indicate that 1) T4 and GH actively participate in postnatal regulation of small intestinal ontogeny; 2) thyroid hormones act directly on developing intestinal tissues to independently produce the normal maturation of the disaccharidases by mechanisms that are not likely to involve alterations in processing of the enzyme-protein; and 3) maturation of aminooligopeptidase is not regulated by pituitary hormones, in distinct contrast to the disaccharidases.\r"

On day 100 of gestation (term = day 184), baboons were anesthetized with halothane/nitrous oxide, the fetus was exteriorized, and a cannula was inserted into a fetal carotid artery. Five minutes later (experimental time zero), a fetal carotid blood sample was obtained, and saline (0.5 ml) with (n = 6) or without (n = 3) ovine CRH (100 ng estimated to equal 500 ng/kg BW) was then infused via the fetal carotid over a 3-min period. Fetal blood samples were taken 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min post-CRH/saline treatment and assayed for ACTH. Mean (+/- SE) pretreatment fetal plasma ACTH concentrations were similar in animals that subsequently received saline (26 +/- 3 pg/ml) or CRH (29 +/- 6 pg/ml). Fetal plasma ACTH remained constant after the infusion of saline. In contrast, CRH increased (P less than 0.05) fetal plasma ACTH within 5 min in six of six baboons to a value (58 +/- 12 pg/ml) that exceeded (P less than 0.05) the zero time value and the respective mean value (27 +/- 5 pg/ml) in saline-treated fetuses. Fetal plasma ACTH concentrations continued to rise in four of six baboons 15 min after CRH injection to a level (68 +/- 15 pg/ml) which exceeded that in saline controls (27 +/- 2 pg/ml). In fetuses treated with CRH, overall mean fetal plasma ACTH concentrations from 0-60 min increased at a rate (1.47 pg/min) greater (P less than 0.05) than that in fetuses injected with saline (0.07 pg/min). In contrast to the effects of intracarotid CRH injection, fetal plasma ACTH was not increased after the infusion of 100 ng CRH into a fetal antecubital vein of three additional animals. Collectively, these findings indicate that intracarotid injection of a bolus of CRH into the baboon fetus rapidly increased fetal plasma ACTH concentrations. Moreover, the site of action of CRH was presumably the fetal pituitary. Therefore, we suggest that the baboon fetal hypothalamic-pituitary axis at midgestation has the capacity to secrete ACTH in response to a challenge of CRH.\r"

Treatment of Leydig cells with 8-bromo-cAMP (cAMP) was essential for expression of P450(17 alpha) mRNA, but not for 3 beta HSD. Treatment with cAMP caused a decrease in basal levels of 3 beta HSD mRNA. The addition of aminoglutethimide (AG), an inhibitor of cholesterol metabolism, to the cAMP-treated cultures resulted in increased expression of both 3 beta HSD and P450(17 alpha) mRNA levels. The addition of testosterone or the androgen agonist mibolerone to cAMP- plus AG-treated cultures reduced 3 beta HSD and P450(17 alpha) mRNA to levels comparable to those observed when cells were treated with cAMP only. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone reduced both basal and cAMP- plus AG-induced increases in 3 beta HSD mRNA, but not in P450(17 alpha) mRNA. Estradiol at a concentration of 1 microM had no effect on cAMP- plus AG-induced 3 beta HSD or P450(17 alpha) mRNA levels. The role of protein synthesis in mediating the cAMP induction of 3 beta HSD, P450(17 alpha), and P450scc was investigated. The addition of cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) to cAMP-treated cultures for 24 h completely suppressed both constitutive and cAMP-induced 3 beta HSD mRNA levels. Cycloheximide also repressed cAMP-induced levels of P450(17 alpha) to 12% of levels observed in the absence of cycloheximide. In sharp contrast, 24-h treatment with cycloheximide did not suppress cAMP induction of P450scc mRNA, but reduced basal levels by approximately 50%. A time course of induction by cAMP (50 microM) of P450(17 alpha) and P450scc mRNA showed very similar rates of increase in P450(17 alpha) and P450scc mRNA, with the greatest increase occurring between 12 and 24 h of treatment. The results of the study demonstrate that in normal mouse Leydig cells steady state levels of mRNA for 3 beta HSD, P450(17 alpha), and P450scc are differentially regulated. cAMP is required for maximal levels of all three mRNAs. There is high constitutive expression of 3 beta HSD and P450scc mRNA, while expression of P450(17 alpha) mRNA is absolutely dependent on cAMP stimulation. Endogenously produced testosterone negatively regulates the expression of cAMP-induced P450(17 alpha) and 3 beta HSD, while the glucocorticoid dexamethasone negatively regulates 3 beta HSD and P450scc.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Since estrogen treatment increases prostaglandin (PG) production by the perfused rabbit uterus, and PGs contribute to the alpha 1-adrenergic contractile response, we postulated that estrogen's effects on PG production or response may play a role in the increased alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity induced by estrogen. We studied the effects of the eicosanoid synthesis inhibitor meclofenamate (60 microM) on the response to epinephrine (10(-9)-10(-5) M) of uterine strips from ovariectomized, mature, and estrogen-treated rabbits in terms of both contractile response and PGE2 and PGF2 alpha production. We also measured the contractile response to PGE2 and PGF2 alpha (both 10(-10)-10(-5) M) and KCl (70 mM) of uterine strips from these groups. We found that in the ovariectomized rabbits, meclofenamate decreased PG production, but did not alter the alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity. In the mature rabbit uterus, meclofenamate decreased both PGE2 and PGF2 alpha production and reduced the alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity. In the estrogen-treated rabbit uterus, meclofenamate decreased PGF2 alpha, but not PGE2, production and did not alter the alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity. Finally, meclofenamate reduced the contractile response to KCl in all three groups, and exposure to PGE2 increased the contractile response to KCl in both the mature and estrogen-treated rabbits. We conclude that PGs play a role in the increase in the alpha 1-adrenergic sensitivity of the uterus in mature rabbits, and that this may be the result of an estrogen-mediated alteration in the postreceptor effects of PGs.\r"

Eight female and three male castrate fetuses served as controls. After a 2-week washout period all fetuses were operated upon in utero between 106-116 days and were studied longitudinally over a 2- to 35-day period. LH pulsatility was determined from blood samples obtained every 15 min over a standard 3-h observation period and assayed for LH by RIA (NIH LH-S16 standard). LH pulse frequency in the castrate androgenized females (41 pulses in 19 observation periods; 1 pulse/1.4 h) was significantly higher than that in non-androgenized female controls (18 pulses in 28 observation periods; 1 pulse/4.7 h observation), but was similar to that in castrate males (23 pulses in 28 observation periods; 1 pulse/1.3 h). Furthermore, LH pulse frequency in the sham castrate androgenized females (26 pulses in 13 observation periods; 1 pulse/1.5 h) was comparable to that in castrate androgenized females as well as that in castrate males. The enhanced LH pulsatility in androgenized female fetuses strongly suggests that T exposure between 30-86 days results in male-specific entrainment of hypothalamic LH regulation. Moreover, the comparable enhancement of LH pulse frequency in both sham castrate and castrate androgenized female groups suggests that in the T-exposed fetus T withdrawal alone is sufficient to result in enhanced LH pulsatility. These findings strongly suggest that T of fetal testicular origin results in male-specific entrainment of hypothalamic function and may be an important feature of male neural organization in this species.\r"

Bovine PTH-(1-34) (24 pM to 240 nM) produced a dose-dependent increase in Cai2+ (EC50, 3 nM), which returned to baseline within 75 sec. Human alpha-thrombin produced an increase in Cai2+ (ECmax, 10 U/ml) which was similar to that of PTH with respect to both magnitude and time course. Chelation of extracellular calcium with 5.0 mM EGTA did not alter the Cai2+ response to either PTH or thrombin. When added together at maximally effective concentrations, PTH and thrombin produced additive effects on Cai2+ in the presence and absence of EGTA. The additive effects of PTH and thrombin on Cai2+ were confirmed at the single cell level, using laser-based image analysis. Bradykinin (1 microM) produced a significant increase in Cai2+ in UMR 106-H5 cells which was of lesser magnitude than the peak 2- to 3-fold increase elicited by PTH or thrombin. Preexposure of cells to 10 U/ml thrombin for 2 min abolished the Cai2+ response to bradykinin, whereas preexposure to 240 nM PTH had no effect on the Cai2+ response to bradykinin. Thrombin elicited a rapid increase in the accumulation of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates (IP2 and IP3) in UMR 106-H5 cells, with increases in [3H]1,4,5-IP3 detectable as early as 15 sec after the addition of thrombin. Bradykinin increased [3H]IP production to a lesser extent than thrombin, whereas PTH neither increased [3H]IP accumulation nor potentiated the [3H]IP response to thrombin. The results suggest that thrombin and bradykinin mobilize Cai2+ from a shared IP3-responsive calcium pool, whereas PTH may use signals in addition to 1,4,5-IP3 to mobilize calcium from a distinct cellular calcium pool. Alternatively, specific calcium compartmentalization exists, and there is differential coupling of these agonists to the 1,4,5-IP3/Cai2+ pathway.\r"

The administration protocol used for both treatments produced either a continuous dopaminergic input (CB-154 treatment) or a complete dopaminergic blockade (DOM treatment). Pulse analysis was performed on the data series using the algorithm Detect. In both estrous female and male rats, dopaminergic receptor activation by CB-154 reduced peak and trough values, pulse amplitude, area under the pulse, and mean PRL levels. In contrast, a complete dopamine (DA) receptor blockade by DOM increased these parameters. Domperidone treatment increased pulse frequency and reduced pulse interval and duration. Bromocriptine, however, differentially affected some pulsatility parameters depending on the sex of the rats. In females, CB-154 did not alter any of the qualitative parameters (frequency, pulse interval, and duration) of pulsatile PRL secretion. In contrast, in male rats the treatment reduced frequency and duration while increasing pulse interval. CB-154 reduced basal PRL levels in male rats, whereas in estrous females this parameter was not altered. PRL pulses were further evaluated by frequency distribution analysis, using the area under the pulses divided by the baseline to normalize the data due to treatment-induced differences in baselines. This calculation allows the estimation of the amount of hormone released per pulse over the baseline. In both estrous female and male rats, two classes of PRL pulses were identified. One class corresponded to pulses containing a small mass of hormone [small mass pulses (SM)], while the others were characterized by pulses containing a large mass of hormone [big mass pulses (BM)]. Interestingly, both the dopaminergic agonist CB-154 and the dopaminergic antagonist DOM dramatically diminished BM pulse incidence in both estrous female and male rats. In fact, BM pulses were practically absent in both experimental groups. To further substantiate this notion, animals of each experimental group were assigned to one of the following categories: animals depicting BM and SM pulses or rats presenting solely SM pulses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A recognition site for benzodiazepines structurally different from that linked to various gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor subtypes is located on the outer mitochondrial membranes of steroidogenic cells. This protein has been signified to be important in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis. Because of its location it is designated herein as the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR). A putative endogenous ligand for MBR is the peptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), previously shown to displace drugs from MBR and to be expressed and stored in steroidogenic cells rich in MBR. The two model systems used to study steroidogenic regulation by DBI were the Y-1 adrenocortical and MA-10 Leydig cell lines previously shown to be applicable in studies of mitochondrial steroidogenesis. Both cell lines contain DBI as well as DBI processing products, including the DBI fragments that on reverse phase HPLC coelute with the naturally occurring triakontatetraneuropeptide [TTN; DBI-(17-50)] and octadecaneuropeptide [DBI-(33-50)]. When DBI purified from rat brain was added to mitochondria prepared from Y-1 and MA-10 cell lines, it increased the rates of pregnenolone formation in a dose-related manner. In both cell lines, maximal stimulation (3-fold) of mitochondrial steroidogenesis was obtained with 0.33 microM DBI, with an EC50 of approximately 0.1 microM. However, DBI concentrations higher than 1 microM caused a smaller increase in pregnenolone formation. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine that binds with high nanomolar affinity to MBR, was recently shown to act as an antagonist of ACTH and LH/hCG-induced steroidogenesis and was found in the present studies to inhibit DBI-stimulated mitochondrial steroidogenesis. During the incubation with mitochondria, DBI was partially processed to different peptide fragments, including octadecaneuropeptide and TTN. To determine whether DBI processing products influence mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis, several DBI fragments and other peptides structurally unrelated to DBI were tested. Among these, only TTN stimulated mitochondrial steroid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner similar to DBI.\r"

The present study was designed to find out whether human (h) GRF agonist could be internalized and to determine the subcellular localization of internalized peptide in somatotrophs. Autoradiography was performed on rat anterior pituitary glands removed at specific time intervals (2-60 min) after iv injection of monoradioiodinated [125I] (His1,Nle27) hGRF (1-32) NH2. Administration of an excess of unlabeled hGRF agonist along with the radioiodinated hormone prevented the uptake, indicating the specificity of the reaction. At the ultrastructural level only the somatotrophs appeared to contain silver grains. The main effect of hGRF agonist injection on the cytological aspect of the somatotrophs was a decrease in the area occupied by secretory granules, accompanied inversely, by an increase in that of the Golgi complex. The time course study in somatotrophs showed that five compartments (plasma membrane, secretory granules, cytoplasmic matrix, nuclear membrane, and lysosomes) have distinct marked labeling patterns. Plasma membrane, secretory granules, and nuclear membrane were labeled throughout the time course studied (2-60 min after injection). Cytoplasmic matrix was labeled 5 min post injection and lysosomes 15 and 30 min after injection. The Golgi complex, mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus matrix were not labeled. The findings show the cellular specificity of GRF uptake by somatotrophs and the internalization process from the plasma membrane to the intracellular organelles (secretory granules, lysosomes, and nuclear membrane). Labeling of the secretory granule compartment suggests that granules may bind and protect internalized peptide from lysosomal degradation. The appearance of label on the nuclear membrane suggests that GRF may have effects on the translocation of messenger RNA from nucleus to cytoplasm in somatotrophs.\r"

  ".U": "91339772\r", 
  ".W": "Most newborn mammals, including humans, are susceptible to neonatal hypoglycemia shortly after birth, especially if fasted. Glycogenolysis provides short term benefit, but gluconeogenesis is required for glucose homeostasis at this stage of development. A functional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is essential for glucose homeostasis in adults, but little is known of the importance of this endocrine axis in this regard during the neonatal period. The neonatal rat is an excellent model for study of both glucose metabolism and the HPA, and shares many similarities with other mammals. For the first 2 weeks of postnatal life, the rat HPA appears to be relatively unresponsive to stress, however, which would seem maladaptive during the critical first 24 h. The present study examined the ability of day-old rats to respond to hypoglycemia with activation of the HPA system. Each of three doses of insulin resulted in hypoglycemia (glucose, less than 40 mg/dl), with the greatest decrease in glucose 120 min after an insulin dose of 2.5 U/kg BW. At this dose, plasma corticosterone was increased to levels comparable to those observed in adults. The steroid response was associated with a small but significant increase in ACTH, and both endocrine responses were delayed compared to those in adults. There was no difference in adrenal response time to ACTH in incubations of adrenal cells isolated from day-old or adult rats, however. The stimulatory effect of insulin was progressively diminished in older animals (2-6 days postnatal). Insulin had no direct effect on adrenal steroidogenesis either alone or in combination with ACTH when tested on dispersed cells in vitro. We conclude that 1) the adrenal gland is very sensitive to the stress of hypoglycemia for 1 day after birth, but rapidly declines in activity over the first 6 days of life; 2) the response time of the HPA axis to hypoglycemia stress is delayed in day-old rats, and this delay occurs above the level of the adrenal; and 3) there may be factors in addition to ACTH that promote steroidogenesis on the first postnatal day, or there may be bioactive or immunoreactive differences in the ACTH molecule during this time.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6) probably plays a central role in the acute phase response and in haemopoiesis and may be involved in the control of bone turnover. We have studied the release of IL-6 from human trabecular bone cells treated with a variety of stimuli using a specific bioassay. In serum free medium, unstimulated human osteoblast-like cells produced IL-6 in the range of 1000-2050 pg/ml/24 h. Recombinant human interleukin 1 (IL-1 alpha) (10(-13)-10(-11) M), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and lipopolysaccharide (5-500 ng/ml) all stimulated release of IL-6 from human bone cells. Maximal levels of 17,000 pg/ml were observed using the highest concentration of IL-1. 1,25(OH)2D3 and PTH did not stimulate IL-6 release. Using a specific sheep antihuman IL-6 antibody, all IL-6 activity could be neutralized. In parallel studies, ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells released around 50 pg/ml of IL-6 under basal conditions which were increased to a maximum of 900 pg/ml by treatment with PTH (10(-9) M). The cytokines were less effective and 1,25(OH)2D3 again had no effect. Modulation of expression of IL-6 mRNA in human osteoblast cells was examined using a human complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probe. The mRNA was constitutively expressed, and IL-1 (10(-11) M) and TNF (10(-7) M) induced further mRNA expression within 2 h, which was sustained over 24 h. 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-7) M), IL-6 (2000 pg/ml), and PTH (10(-9) M) exerted no effects at any time point. Dexamethasone (10(-6) M) suppressed both basal and IL-1- and TNF-induced IL-6 mRNA expression. IL-6 receptor mRNA was constitutively expressed but was not regulated by any of the above agents. It is clear that rodent and human osteoblasts differ in their production of IL-6 and its modulation. These data support the hypothesis that IL-6 is produced locally in human bone by osteoblasts under the direction of other cytokines. This could have implications in bone remodeling, haemopoiesis, and systemic responses to local injury.\r"

It has been demonstrated previously by Northern analysis that adult rat ovaries contain mRNA transcripts for IGFBP-2 and -3. Here we show by Northern analysis that adult rat ovaries contain mRNA for IGFBP-4, but the mRNA for IGFBP-1 was below the limit of detection. Using in situ hybridization, IGFBP-1 mRNA was not detected in any of the ovaries tested. The IGFBP-2 mRNA was localized specifically in thecal interstitial cells (TIC) and secondary interstitial cells of all ovaries. The IGFBP-2 signal was very strong in TIC of all Graafian follicles (healthy and atretic) and very strong in all secondary interstitial cells located in different regions of the ovary, but weak in TIC of preantral follicles. The IGFBP-3 hybridization signal was localized specifically to some corpora lutea. Here the hybridization single for IGFBP-3 was strong and distributed throughout the corpus luteum, strong but localized to only some luteal cells, or not detectable. The IGFBP-4 mRNA was localized almost exclusively to granulosa cells of atretic follicles. The intensity of the IGFBP-4 signals appeared to increase as the level of atresia increased. In some cases, IGFBP-4 signals were detected in the TIC, but they were weak and variable. These results show that the mRNAs for IGFBP-2, -3, and -4 are localized to the interstitial cells, corpora lutea, and atretic granulosa cells, respectively. The tissue-specific synthesis of IGFBP subtypes in specialized ovarian cells provides an excellent system to study the manner in which IGFBP synthesis is controlled and their potential role as an autocrine and paracrine factors.\r"

Further quantitation of total glucose transporters by [125I]3-iodo-4-azido-phenethyl-amido-7-O-succinyldeacetyl-forskoli n photoaffinity labeling was performed. Glut 1 was prominently distributed in G18 and P1 brain vascular endothelial cells, with comparatively little immunoreactivity observed in brain parenchyma. Conversely, at P10, Glut 1 was prominent in brain parenchyma (undifferentiated cells) and less evident in the vascular endothelium. However, at P21, a resurgence of Glut 1 in vascular endothelial cells was observed, as was a sustained presence in parenchymal cells. On P greater than 40, a distribution in vascular endothelial cells and, to a minor extent, in parenchymal perivascular stellate cells was noted. Microvessel preparation Glut 1 (approximately 55-60 kDa) and [125I] 3-iodo-4-azido-phenethyl-amido-7-O-succinyldeacetyl-forskolin photoaffinity-labeled glucose transporters gradually increased from G18 through P10 to P greater than 40. This developmental increase in Glut 1 was also seen in whole homogenates (approximately 45-47 kDa), but not in crude brain membranes. Thus, isolated microvascular preparations indicated that Glut 1 levels constantly increased with maturation, but direct visualization of brain sections revealed that the localization in different cellular compartments changed with development. These alterations in cellular localization of glucose transporters, appear to occur in concert with the changing glucose metabolic needs of the brain, which, during the various stages of development, exhibits constantly changing phases of cellular growth and proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Peptide variations in the alpha-subunit (molecules starting at alpha 3 and alpha 4) and beta-subunit (missing linkages at beta 44-45 and beta 47-48) of hCG have been reported by several investigators. Studies, however, have been limited to standard hCG preparations (purified from large pools of urine) and other hCG samples from mixed urines. In this study we used chromatographic procedures to purify the total hCG content of 13 individual urines, 6 from patients with pregnancy and 7 from those with trophoblast disease (no hCG-containing fractions were excluded). Then, we examined for the first time the peptide variability among individual samples of hCG. We report 1) that individual hCG preparations have nicks (missing linkages) in the beta-subunit, primarily between residue 47-48 (11 of 13 samples) and, less commonly, at the linkage 44-45 or 46-47 (3 of 13 samples); 2) the extent of nicking varies greatly between individual preparations (range, 0-100% of molecules); 3) varying alpha-subunit N-terminal heterogeneity (N-terminus starting at alpha 3 or alpha 4) was also present (range, 0-28% of molecules), but was confined to preparations from individuals with trophoblast disease (6 of 7 samples from trophoblast disease urine, 0 of 6 from pregnancy urine); 4) hCG missing the beta-subunit C-terminal region was also detected (2 of 13 hCG preparations); and 5) 1 of 13 preparations was nicked on the hCG alpha-subunit, between residues 70 and 71. Thus, 12 of 13 individual hCG samples demonstrated at least 1 of 4 different forms of peptide heterogeneity. We conclude that individual hCG samples vary widely in the type and extent of peptide heterogeneity, an observation that is not appreciated when pools of hCG are studied.\r"

  ".W": "hCG, the hormone produced by the trophoblast throughout pregnancy, has peptide bond cleavages, or nicks, in the beta-subunit. We sought to compare the nature of these nicks in standard reference preparations of hCG, to determine the enzymes that may be responsible for generating the peptide bond cleavages, and to devise means of separating nicked from intact hormone. The standard reference preparations of hCG, which are purified from a commercial product made from large pools of pregnancy urine, were found to have varying concentrations of nicked hormone. The preceding report showed that 11 of 13 hCG preparations isolated from individual pregnancy urine samples were nicked at the beta 47-48 bond, with 2 of 13 having a second nick at beta 44-45. As shown here, all of the hCG reference standards are nicked to similar extents at both the beta 47-48 bond and the beta 44-45 bond. The percentage of peptide bond nicking in the various hCG standard preparations ranged from 10-20% and appeared higher in the more recent preparations. We showed that human leukocyte elastase is capable of specifically cleaving the beta 44-45 bond, and in extended digests it can also cleave the beta 48-49 and beta 51-52 peptide bonds. Thus, human leukocyte elastase may be the origin of some of these cleavages in the individual samples and the reference standards. Furthermore, we report that a monoclonal antibody directed to hCG alpha-beta dimer binds preferentially to nonnicked hCG and much less to nicked hCG.\r"

  ".W": "Nicks, or missing peptide linkages, have been found in hCG beta-subunit between residues 44 and 45 and between residues 47 and 48. We examined the occurrence and biological and immunological activities of nicked hCG. As shown by sequence analysis, CR127 standard hCG is approximately 20% nicked, half at beta 44-45 and half at beta 47-48. Treatment with human leukocyte elastase increased the extent of nicking of CR127 standard hCG. The longer the incubation of CR127 standard with human leukocyte elastase (0, 2, and 21 h), the greater the extent of nicked hCG (20%, 46%, and 89%). As the extent of nicking increased, the receptor-binding ability diminished, as did the ability to stimulate progesterone production by rat corpus luteal cells in vitro (0.9, 0.74, and 0.29 microgram/microgram hCG, respectively). In a regression analysis, a linear relationship was indicated between the extent of nicking and receptor binding values (97% correlation) and between the extent of nicking and steroidogenic activity in vitro (99% correlation). From the intercepts of the regression lines, it was estimated that nicks reduced receptor binding by 11-fold and reduced the steroidogenic activity of hCG by 5-fold. We examined eight individual hCG preparations, three purified from pregnancy urine, three from urine from patients with hydatidiform mole, and two from urine from women with choriocarcinoma. In descending order, the eight individual hCG preparations were 100%, 100%, 85%, 76%, 42%, 41%, 0%, and 0% intact. Although no correlation was observed between the percent intact and the ability of the eight individual samples to displace 50% [125I]hCG in binding CG/LH receptor (r less than 0.5), a close correlation was noted between the percent intact and the steroidogenic activity in vitro (98% correlation). This separated the effects of nicking on receptor binding and steroidogenic activities and indicated that while multiple factors influence receptor binding, only nicking suppresses the steroidogenic activity of bound hCG. We examined the recognition of nicked hCG molecules by different hCG immunoassays. The Hybritech Tandem assay measured total hCG and did not distinguish nicked and intact hCG molecules (in a regression analysis, immunoactivity vs. percent intact hCG, r less than 0.5). In contrast, the immunometric assay using B109 hCG dimer-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-beta-peroxidase only detected the intact component of hCG (in a regression analysis, immunoreactivity vs. percent intact hCG, 98% correlation). We used these assays together to estimate the percentage of intact hCG and to deduce the extent of nicking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal antiestrogen which has been reported by various investigators to have estrogen agonist and antagonist effects on rat bone. These different interpretations may be due to differences in the ovarian status, estrogen levels, and/or tamoxifen levels of the rats. To address this issue, a dose response was determined for the effects of tamoxifen on bone histomorphometry in intact female and ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The results were compared with those obtained after treatment of OVX rats with estrogen alone or a combination of estrogen and tamoxifen. OVX resulted in increases in growth rate (weight gain) and periosteal bone formation rate and decreases in uterine weight and cancellous bone fractional volume (BV/TV). Treatment of OVX rats with estrogen resulted in dose-dependent decreases in growth rate and periosteal bone formation rate as well as dose-dependent increases in uterine weight and BV/TV. Similarly, tamoxifen treatment resulted in dose-dependent decreases in overall growth rate and periosteal bone formation rate in both OVX and intact rats. Tamoxifen treatment prevented the decrease in BV/TV after OVX, although the highest dose of tamoxifen resulted in a small decrease in BV/TV in intact female rats. In contrast to estrogen, tamoxifen treatment prevented the increase in uterine weight in intact female rats as well as the decrease in uterine weight in OVX rats. Tamoxifen treatment did not alter the effects of 17 beta-estradiol on the periosteal bone formation rate in OVX rats, but reduced the increase in BV/TV to values similar to those in intact rats. These results are consistent with tamoxifen behaving as a partial estrogen agonist on rat bone.\r"

  ".W": "An immortalized LHRH cell line has recently been developed by genetically targeting these neurons for tumorigenesis. One of the subclones, the GT1-7 cells, was characterized at both the light and electron microscopic levels to study the cellular and subcellular organization of these cells, particularly as they relate to biosynthesis, processing, and secretion. The cells were fixed onto slides 18-36 h after plating. LHRH and GnRH-associated peptide (GAP) immunoreactivities (IR) were detected by immunocytochemistry using colloidal gold labeling. These cultured cells exhibited the classical neuronal appearance of LHRH neurons, and they established numerous interconnections. Neighboring neurons were coupled by tight junctions, while more distant cells were interconnected with neural axon-like processes and collaterals. This cellular organization is suggestive of a neural network where neuronal activity is coordinated. At the ultrastructural level, the nondividing cells possessed indented nuclei, well developed Golgi complexes, and abundant numbers of ribosomes and secretory granules. Clathrin-coated vesicles were found in fusion with the plasma membrane. The ribosomes and secretory vesicles were particularly prominent, suggestive of high rates of protein biosynthesis and secretion. All of the cells immunostained for both LHRH and GAP; however, GAP IR was always more pronounced than that for LHRH. This finding was corroborated by biochemical data reported in a companion paper. The GAP IR was associated with ribosomes and secretory vesicles. By comparison, LHRH IR was restricted mainly to the secretory vesicles. Using colloidal gold particles of different sizes to denote LHRH or GAP IR, it was determined that both GAP and LHRH IR were colocalized within the same secretory vesicle. Taken together, these data suggest that pro-LHRH is biosynthesized on the ribosomes, packaged as an intact protein into the secretory vesicles, processed to LHRH and GAP-(1-56) within these vesicles, and transported to the periphery of the cell in preparation for secretion. These morphological data emphasize the utility of using these immortalized LHRH neuronal cells to dissect the cellular and subcellular architecture involved in biosynthesis, processing, and secretion. In addition, our results provide the first detailed evidence for the intracellular pathway involved in pro-LHRH biosynthesis, processing, and secretion in these cultured neuronal cells.\r"

  ".W": "An immortalized hypothalamic neuronal cell line was recently developed by genetically targeting the expression of the simian virus-40 large T-antigen in LHRH neurons. These GT1 cells were subcloned to GT1-1, GT1-3, and GT1-7 cells, and they have been shown to express the mRNA for pro-LHRH and secrete LHRH-like immunoreactive (IR) materials into the media. The purpose of our study was to biochemically and immunologically characterize the IR materials within and secreted from these cells. Both LHRH- and GnRH-associated peptide (GAP)-like IR materials were present and were secreted from these four cell lines. Up to 3% of the total cellular protein was composed of LHRH and GAP materials. When materials from the cell lysate and media were separated according to mol wt (Mr), at least three different pro-LHRH species were detected. These precursors contained both LHRH- and GAP-like IR determinants, and they eluted in the void volume and at approximately 10,000-12,000 and 8,400-8,500 Mr. A material that contained GAP-like IR eluted at approximately 6,500-6,800 Mr. This species is probably mouse GAP-(1-56) because it eluted on a reverse phase column in the approximate position of rat GAP-(1-56). Cell lysates contained a single LHRH-like IR form which coeluted on a size-exclusion column with synthetic LHRH. This material stimulated secretion of LH from anterior pituitary cells in a dose-response manner. By comparison, two different molecular forms of LHRH were detected in media at approximately 1,500 and 540 Mr. HPLC analyses revealed these peaks to be heterogeneous and to contain at least (Gln1)LHRH-(Gly11,Lys12,Arg13), (Gln1)LHRH-(Gly1,Lys12), LHRH-(Gly11), and LHRH. These experiments demonstrate that the cells contain and secrete multiple molecular forms of the pro-LHRH and that processing of the prohormone must involve 1) cleavage by an endopeptidase to give GAP-(1-56) and a C-terminally extended LHRH, 2) removal of C-terminal basic amino acids by a carboxypeptidase, 3) amidation of LHRH-(Gly11) to LHRH, and 4) cyclization of glutamine to pyroglutamate at the N-terminal of LHRH. These results provide the first evidence for intermediates in the metabolic pathway of pro-LHRH to LHRH.\r"

  ".W": "The multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) stimulates osteoclastic resorption. It is not known which steps in osteoclast formation are affected by TNF alpha. We have investigated the effects of recombinant human TNF alpha (rhTNF alpha) on osteoclast development and osteoclastic resorption in two different in vitro resorption systems which are each characterized by a different stage of development of the osteoclast. The effects were further compared to those of bovine PTH-(1-84). rhTNF alpha at concentrations between 0.01-50 ng/ml (3 x 10(-13) to 1.5 x 10(-9) M) did not alter the activity of mature osteoclasts, measured as 45Ca release in fetal mouse radii. In the osteoclast precursor-dependent system (fetal mouse metacarpals) rhTNF alpha had a biphasic effect. It stimulated resorption dose-dependently from 0.01 ng/ml onward, with a maximal response at 0.5 ng/ml. At concentrations above 10 ng/ml rhTNF alpha, resorption was inhibited. In experiments in which irradiation was used to block replication, it was found that TNF alpha stimulates the proliferation of osteoclast progenitors at both low and high concentrations. As a result, at relatively low concentrations, more osteoclasts were formed in the calcified matrix, coinciding with an increased release of 45Ca. However, at relatively high concentrations, the increase in osteoclast progenitors did not lead to increased resorption, since the putative osteoclast progenitors were arrested in the periosteum. In comparison, bovine PTH-(1-84) stimulated resorption independent of proliferation by enhancing the differentiation of postmitotic osteoclast precursors and activating mature osteoclasts. In conclusion, the effects of TNF alpha on osteoclastic resorption are dependent on the stage of osteoclast development and the concentrations applied.\r"

To explore this further, a new in vitro model system was developed. Rat seminiferous tubule segments from stages I, V, VIIa, and VIII-IX of the cycle were isolated by transillumination-assisted microdissection, cultured in chemically defined serum-free medium supplemented with human recombinant IL-1 alpha, and labeled with [3H]thymidine. During incubation, spontaneous progression of spermatogenesis was noted. Inactive stage VIIa tubule segments differentiated to stage VIII and initiated DNA synthesis, and concomitantly started to secrete IL-1-like factor. DNA synthesis of stages VIII-IX ceased through differentiation of spermatocytes to leptotene-zygotene (stages XII-XIII of the cycle). IL-1 alpha stimulated DNA synthesis significantly in spermatogonia of stage I. Meiotic DNA synthesis at stage VIIa was stimulated (48 h/34 C) and maintained at stages VIII-IX (48 h/34 C). IL-1 alpha seems to act as a regulator of spermatogenic DNA synthesis in both mitotic and meiotic phases. It has mainly stimulating and maintaining effects, but it may also be inhibitory under certain conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of GH receptor (GHR) and GH-binding protein (GHBP) mRNAs in multiple rat tissues was examined by Northern blotting using a cDNA fragment encoding the common extracellular domain of the GHR and the serum GHBP. Both GHR and GHBP mRNAs [4.5 and 1.2 kilobases (kb), respectively] were present in liver, kidney, adrenal, heart, muscle, ovary, mammary gland, gastrointestinal tract, and adipose tissue, but were barely or not detectable in testis, thymus, or brain. These observations suggest that GH exerts direct effects across a broad spectrum of rat tissues. Nuclease protection analysis also confirmed the presence in extrahepatic tissues of a GHR mRNA with up to 50% of the cytoplasmic domain being identical in sequence to that of the hepatic GHR mRNA. This suggests, but does not prove, that different receptor classes with differing intracellular signalling mechanisms may not exist. It is also clear from our studies that liver was the most abundant source of the truncated (1.2 kb) mRNA and is, therefore, believed to be the primary site of GHBP synthesis. Also, more importantly, at least in the rat, it was only GHBP mRNA that was up-regulated to any extent during pregnancy (female vs. pregnant, P less than 0.001). No significant changes were observed in the abundance of the full-length (4.5 kb) GHR mRNA. This pregnancy-related change in GHBP mRNA was also accompanied by a comparable increase in the actual level of measurable serum GHBP (female vs. pregnant, P = 0.005). Little change was seen in hepatic membrane binding. These data suggest that the GHBP and GHR are both widely coexpressed, but that the expression is not always coordinately regulated. This raises the possibility that the GHBP and GHR may have distinct roles in the regulation of GH delivery and action.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated that the thyroid gland is required for the changes in LH secretion that lead to the end of the breeding season of female sheep, a reproductive transition generated within the ewe by an endogenous annual rhythm. The present study tested the hypothesis that this role of the thyroid is mediated via the GnRH neurosecretory system. The pulsatile secretion of GnRH into hypophyseal portal blood and LH into peripheral blood, as well as the neuroanatomical distribution of GnRH neurons and their light microscopic morphology, were compared among anestrous ewes and thyroidectomized (THX) ewes that failed to make the transition to the anestrous season. The study was conducted under photoperiodic conditions in which the transition to anestrus was generated by the endogenous rhythm. Each animal was ovariectomized and treated sc with a constant release implant of estradiol to normalize gonadal steroid status among thyroid-intact and THX ewes. High frequency pulses of GnRH and LH were evident in THX ewes that failed to make the transition to anestrus, whereas pulsatile secretion of GnRH and LH was generally not observed in thyroid-intact controls that had entered anestrus. This marked effect of thyroidectomy on GnRH secretion was not associated with widespread changes in the total number, distribution, or light microscopic morphology of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus and preoptic area. Our finding that pulsatile secretion of GnRH is elevated in THX ewes that fail to make the transition to anestrus supports the hypothesis that the thyroid gland is required for the endogenously generated switch in function of the GnRH neurosecretory system that leads to the end of the breeding season of the ewe.\r"

  ".U": "91339788\r", 
  ".W": "In this study we have examined the effect of population density on the ability of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) to induce PRL mRNA, DNA synthesis, and progesterone receptor in GH4C1 pituitary tumor cells. These parameters were examined at three subconfluent population densities that varied over a 4-fold range. The culture medium was changed daily in these experiments to reduce the possibility of nutrient depletion, medium toxification, or E2 metabolism. At the low population density, a 5-day treatment with E2 at a concentration of 1.0 nM resulted in an 8.1-fold increase in the level of PRL mRNA, as measured by the cytosolic dot blot procedure. At the intermediate density, E2 induced PRL mRNA 2.4-fold. At the high density, the level of PRL mRNA was reduced by 50% in response to 5 days of treatment with E2. The cytosolic dot blot procedure would reflect changes in the level of PRL mRNA per cell as well as changes in the number of cells per culture. Therefore, the level of beta-actin mRNA was also measured, assuming that it would remain constant on a per cell basis. When the level of PRL mRNA was normalized to the level of beta-actin mRNA in the same cytosols, E2 increased PRL mRNA 2.6-fold in the low density cultures and 1.9-fold in the intermediate density cultures, and had no effect on the level of PRL mRNA in the high density cultures. The effect of population density on the induction of GH4C1 cell proliferation by E2 was examined directly by measuring cellular DNA, thymidine incorporation by whole cells, and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) incorporation by isolated nuclei. At the low density, E2 initially stimulated GH4C1 cell proliferation, as evidenced by an increased rate of dTTP incorporation. However, this stimulatory effect was lost by day 5 of treatment, as the population density of the E2-treated low density cultures increased. At the high density, the inhibitory effect of E2 on dTTP incorporation was observed by day 2 of treatment and thereafter become more pronounced. These stimulatory and inhibitory effects of E2 were also revealed when the level of cellular DNA was measured. In contrast to the effects of population density on the induction of PRL mRNA and cell proliferation, an increase in density had no observable effect on the induction of progesterone receptor by E2. These data illustrate the critical importance of the culture environment in studies examining estrogen action in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Central release of CRH has recently been implicated in modulating natural killer cell (NK) activity independent of its role in activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In the present study, NK- and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated NK cytotoxicity against K-562 target cells was examined in porcine lymphocytes cultured in vitro with ACTH or pig lymphocytes after iv or im ACTH administration. Physiological concentrations of porcine ACTH (10(-8)-10(-11) M) added to the culture medium had no direct influence on NK- or IL-2-stimulated NK cytotoxicity. In a second experiment four unrestrained pigs with indwelling catheters given an iv bolus of vehicle or ACTH (1 IU/kg BW) at 0800 h showed significantly elevated cortisol levels for 3 h after ACTH. Although serum cortisol had returned to baseline by 4 h after ACTH treatment, NK- and IL-2-stimulated NK cytotoxicity was dramatically elevated (P less than 0.01) compared to that in saline-injected controls. NK cytotoxicity in control pigs followed a diurnal pattern, with low morning and high evening cytotoxicity. Exogenous ACTH, given by bolus in the morning, prevented the normal morning decline in NK cytotoxicity. Because of this unexpected dramatic increase in NK- and IL-2-stimulated NK cytotoxicity in animals given ACTH, the experiment was replicated in two subsequent studies using 16 pigs (8 controls and 8 experimental) in each. Pigs were injected im with either ACTH (1 IU/kg BW) or an equivalent volume of saline at 0600 h. Two hours later, blood was collected by venipuncture to determine NK cytotoxicity and measure the cortisol response. As was observed in the previous study, NK- and IL-2-stimulated NK cytotoxicity was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) than that in saline-injected controls. In the final experiment pigs were given either ACTH (1 IU/kg BW) or an equivalent volume of saline at 1800 h. Two hours later, blood was collected by venipuncture to determine NK cytotoxicity and cortisol response. ACTH administered in the evening increased NK cytotoxicity, but the effect was only marginally significant and far less dramatic than in previous studies. Because ACTH had little effect on NK- and IL-2-stimulated NK activity in vitro, we hypothesize that the stimulatory effect of exogenous ACTH is mediated through an indirect mechanism, possibly through the suppression of central CRH as a result of elevated cortisol. This effect is more pronounced when the stimulatory dose of ACTH is given at a time in the circadian cycle when NK cytotoxicity is normally low.\r"

Paradoxically, however, the GH receptor cloned from liver exhibits no sequence similarity to receptors with known signal transduction mechanisms, including those exhibiting ligand-activated tyrosine kinase activity. These observations raise the possibility that there are two kinds of receptors for GH: the first represented by the cloned liver GH receptor, and the second by a tyrosine kinase-containing GH receptor. To inquire into the possibility of two distinct GH receptors, we determined whether the cloned liver GH receptor shares structural similarities with the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor. When the cloned rabbit liver GH receptor is expressed in human kidney 293 cells, it migrates with a mol wt appropriate for the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor, despite the calculated mol wt of the cloned GH receptor being 60,000 smaller than that of the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor. The recognition of tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor by antipeptide antibodies to three different epitopes on the cytoplasmic domain of the cloned liver GH receptor was also tested. Tyrosyl phosphorylated [125I]human GH-receptor complexes were prepared by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody; this subpopulation of GH-receptor complexes was recognized by all three antipeptide antibodies. The antibodies also recognized similarly isolated tyrosyl phosphorylated GH-receptor complexes, which had been further phosphorylated in solution on tyrosyl residues upon addition of [gamma 32P] ATP. Furthermore, highly purified GH receptors prepared by sequential immunoprecipitation using phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody and any one of the three antipeptide antibodies incorporated 32P into tyrosyl residues upon the addition of [gamma 32P] ATP. These results provide evidence that tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptors share sequence similarity in the cytoplasmic domain with the cloned liver GH receptor. The cloned GH receptor and the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor, therefore, are likely to be the same receptor or related receptor isoforms.\r"

To find out whether this is due to either transcriptional or translational regulation of the AR gene, we determined the levels of AR mRNA by Northern blots in the corpora cavernosa from groups of 16-, 19-, 22-, 27-, 52-, and 90-day-old rats. The AR mRNA rapidly decreases with age and is nearly undetectable in the 52- and 90-day-old rats, paralleling the decline in AR number. The persistence of a low amount of AR mRNA in the adult penis was confirmed by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification of total RNA, and its level was estimated by a semiquantitative modification of this procedure at less than 1/25th of that found in the youngest rats. Smooth muscle cells derived from the 16- and 90-day-old corpora cavernosa express in the AR gene in vitro in approximately the same levels, suggesting that there are factors in culture that up-regulate the AR mRNA. Our results are compatible with the assumption that the age-dependent decrease in AR in the rat penis is due to transcriptional regulation, although they do not exclude the less likely alternative of a selective effect on AR mRNA stability and support the use of this model for studying tissue-specific factors controlling the developmental expression of the AR gene.\r"

These effects of NMDA on LHRH mRNA levels were not due to a generalized excitatory effect in the brain because levels of mRNAs encoding proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the arcuate-periarcuate region were not altered by NMDA and levels of TH mRNA were decreased significantly at 15 and 60 min in neurons of the zona incerta. These data strongly support the hypothesis that changes in cellular levels of LHRH mRNA are tightly linked temporally to changes in LHRH secretion.\r"

Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding human galanin and galanin mRNA associated peptide (GMAP) from both pituitary and neuroblastoma sources has revealed a unique and unexpected structure. In contrast to porcine, bovine and rodent galanin, human galanin lacks a carboxy-terminal amide. By analogy to other neurohormones, the absence of carboxy-terminal amidation would be expected to have significant effects on functional properties such as affinity for different receptor subtypes and physiological half life, and may be responsible for the species specificity observed in the action of galanin.\r"

  ".W": "Eight GPs identified 78 heartsink patients; in an open-ended interview they were asked to explain why they regarded them in this way. A GP's definition of a heartsink patient was influenced by GP sex, practice location, and time of surgery, although the number of participating GPs was too low to make any definite assertions. Practitioners' anticipations of heartsink consultations were generally over-exaggerated, with most of the encounters going better than expected. GPs expressed the view that these patients raised serious professional issues for them, whilst there was also a dislike for these patients' personalities and behaviour. Two levels of the heartsink state are hypothesized: one, a state of inertia, is when the heartsink patient has been a chronic high user of the primary health care system, and a GP has exhausted all avenues. The other is an acute situation with those heartsink patients who have been low users of the system in the past. Recent, new events in these patients' lives have raised an issue that is just as much to do with patient and doctor reaction to these events, as it is about finding a diagnosis or solution to the problem. We present the results and hypotheses to provoke further discussion and research.\r"

From the mother's point of view however, the loss of a wanted pregnancy may be viewed quite differently. A number of studies have identified significant levels of dissatisfaction with the medical care which women have received at the time of a miscarriage. This paper describes a survey of the management of miscarriage by general practitioner trainees and trainers in the West of Scotland and on the basis of responses to a series of MEQ-type questions, indicates GPs views on the importance of counselling, sympathetic listening and good information in this area. The translation of these attitudes and beliefs into practice is, of course, a different issue, and one which may be affected by the task-oriented approach of the new contract.\r"

Contacts with patients with known epilepsy in Dutch General Practice were handled mainly by the practice nurse and most involved repeat prescriptions. Patients suspected of having epilepsy had more attention from the General Practitioner. The involvement of General Practitioners in the care of epilepsy was found to be small, but not unimportant. GPs are in a crucial position as regards the detection of epilepsy. They can enlarge their role in respect of patients with known epilepsy and improve continuity of care.\r"

After three cycles of questioning involving written questionnaires and written feedback, the panel reached a consensus on 35 priorities and recommendations concerning patient education carried out by the GP. A consensus method of this type is a valuable tool for setting standards when scientific findings are not available, and contrasting views play a role in the definition of what constitutes adequate performance.\r"

The theory suggests and explains that compliance is connected with the fulfillment of six relatively simple criteria for the quality of consultations. The theory was tested by comparing predictions of compliance derived from analyses of 63 consultations with patient questionnaire based measurements of compliance. The difference between proportions of patients who were complaint after consultations fulfilling and not fulfilling respectively the criteria was 44%. The 95% confidence limits of this difference were 21% and 67%.\r"

The practice of acupuncture is based on a theoretical system different from our understanding of human anatomy and physiology, and has developed through experience and observation. Stimulation of selective acupoints (situated along 'meridians' in the body) by inserting needles is believed to restore bodily functions by promoting the flow of 'vital energy', throughout the system. Other forms of stimulation which have been developed are heat, electrical stimulation, magnetism and, recently, laser. Laser acupuncture offers distinct advantages over the traditional method because the procedure is pain-free and non-traumatic. Clinical applications include the control of pain in osteoarthritis, lumbago and migraine, and anaesthesia for certain surgical procedures, as well as other ailments of the cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous systems. The technique is easy to learn and there is no need for sophisticated instruments. Thus it is especially useful in developing countries where health resources are limited.\r"

Reliability as determined by a split-half test (coefficient alpha) was adequate but should be improved in future versions of the questionnaire. A study of criterion validity was undertaken to test the questionnaire and to develop methods of testing the validity of measures of patient satisfaction. The two criteria used were the doctors' self-assessment of their own practices and the assessment of an external assessor. The findings supported the validity of the components of continuity, accessibility, availability and premises, but the patients' scores correlated better with the external assessors' scores than the doctors' self-assessed scores. SSQ is a useful foundation for the development of measures of patient satisfaction in general practice.\r"

We assessed the safety and efficacy of thymosin fraction 5 and thymosin-alpha 1 in a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in 12 patients with chronic hepatitis B. All patients had histological and biochemical evidence of active liver disease for at least 6 mo before treatment and were positive for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and HBsAg. Seven patients received thymosin fraction 5 or thymosin-alpha 1 and five patients received placebo twice weekly for 6 mo. By the conclusion of the study (1 yr), serum aminotransferase levels had improved significantly in thymosin-treated patients, but not in the placebo group. Six (86%) of the thymosin treated patients and one (20%) patient given placebo cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). After treatment, replicative forms of hepatitis B virus DNA were present in the liver specimens of four of five placebo-treated patients but in only one of seven thymosin-treated patients (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). Response to thymosin therapy was associated with significant improvements in peripheral blood lymphocyte and CD3 and CD4 counts and in in vitro production of interferon-gamma over initial values. No significant side effects were observed in patients given thymosin or in placebo-treated patients. Clinical, biochemical and serological improvement in patients responding to thymosin were sustained during 26 +/- 3 mo of follow-up. The results of this pilot trial suggest that thymosin therapy promotes disease remission and cessation of hepatitis B virus replication in patients with chronic viral infection.\r"

In this study, intracellular and extracellular levels of HBsAg were measured by radioimmunoassay in primary culture of hepatocytes from 30 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection to determine a possible relationship with hepatitis B virus replication. Serum levels of HBsAg correlated with markers of active viral replication (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.005, and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.02) but inversely with tissue HBsAg (p less than 0.05). In similar fashion, in vitro export of HBsAg was also related to the presence of active viral replication markers (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.02, and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.05) and negatively with tissue HBsAg (p less than 0.001). Export of HBeAg also correlated positively with markers of active viral replication (serum hepatitis B virus DNA, p less than 0.05 and tissue HBcAg, p less than 0.05). Further experiments indicated that intrahepatic pre-S1 and pre-S2 correlated closely with intrahepatic HBsAg, indicating that a failure to export HBsAg was unlikely to be attributable to deficient intracellular expression of pre-S1 or pre-S2. These data indicate that in vitro primary hepatocyte culture of hepatitis B virus-infected cells provides an accurate reflection of in vivo export of HBsAg and that this is closely related to the presence of active viral replication.\r"

Because adhesion is necessary for the interaction of lymphocytes with their target structures, we have studied the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, a ligand for the leukocyte adhesion receptor lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 in the liver of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was seen on interlobular bile ducts and proliferating bile ductules in both conditions. In primary biliary cirrhosis, medium-sized ducts, which are spared by the disease, were negative. Minimal bile-duct staining was seen in conditions in which bile-duct damage is not a major feature, such as nonbiliary cirrhosis and acute liver diseases. In patients with cirrhosis from any cause, strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was detected on the periseptal hepatocytes adjacent to new connective tissue. The intensity of immunohistochemical staining was recorded using a semiquantitative visual scoring system that was subsequently validated quantitatively by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The expression/induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on bile ducts may be important in the pathogenesis of bile-duct damage in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis and is further evidence to support an immune pathogenesis in these two conditions. Furthermore, the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on hepatocytes may be an important factor in the liver-cell damage and fibrosis that occur during the development of cirrhosis.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically stable patients with cirrhosis demonstrate insulin resistance with regard to glucose metabolism. However, much less is known about the two major factors, insulin and plasma amino acid concentration, that regulate protein metabolism in cirrhotic patients. To examine this question, we performed paired euglycemic insulin clamp studies in combination with 14C-leucine and indirect calorimetry. In the first study insulin alone was infused, and the plasma amino acid concentration was allowed to decline. During the second study a balanced amino acid solution was infused with insulin to increase the total plasma amino acid concentration approximately twofold. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal (4.68 vs. 6.45 mg/kg-min, p less than 0.01) was significantly impaired by 30% in cirrhotic patients during both insulin clamp studies. In the postabsorptive state, cirrhotic patients manifested low plasma leucine (76 vs. 102 mumol/L) and alpha-ketoisocaproate (19 vs. 30 mumol/L) concentrations, but all parameters of leucine turnover were normal. When insulin alone was infused, the endogenous leucine flux (an index of protein degradation) declined similarly in cirrhotic patients (30.8 mumol/m2-min) and control (26.9) subjects, and this was accompanied by a similar decrease in plasma leucine concentration (31% vs. 33%). The decline in circulating leucine concentration was accompanied by a parallel decline in leucine oxidation (5.1 vs. 4.6 mumol/m2-min) and nonoxidative (28.9 vs. 26.0 mumol/m2-min) leucine disposal, which were of similar magnitude in cirrhotic patients and control subjects, respectively. In both cirrhotic patients and control subjects, combined hyperinsulinemia/hyperaminoacidemia elicited a similar stimulation of nonoxidative leucine disposal (an index of protein synthesis) and leucine oxidation while causing a greater suppression of endogenous leucine flux than observed with insulin alone. Thus the suppressive effect of insulin on protein degradation and the stimulatory effect of insulin/amino acid infusion on protein synthesis are not impaired in cirrhotic patients, demonstrating a clear-cut dissociation between the effects of insulin on protein and glucose metabolism.\r"

The distribution of the three pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits was examined in the liver and lymph nodes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, patients with other liver diseases and normal subjects by immunohistochemistry using affinity-purified antibodies. Intensity of staining was assessed semiquantitatively and validated by scanning laser confocal microscopy. In primary biliary cirrhosis tissue, the E2 staining pattern did not parallel the reported distribution of mitochondria. E2 staining in biliary epithelial cells was consistently stronger than in hepatocytes. In primary biliary cirrhotic liver, staining of biliary epithelium was significantly stronger than in normal or other liver disease controls; many bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhotic liver demonstrated very high intensity, diffuse distribution of stain. No differences in staining intensity were seen between perivenular hepatocytes in primary biliary cirrhotic liver and those in controls; periportal hepatocytes in primary biliary cirrhotic liver were, however, more intensely stained than perivenular cells. In primary biliary cirrhotic portal lymph nodes, a subset of macrophages showed high-intensity, diffuse distribution of stain. By contrast, staining with antibodies to E1 and E3 (other components of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) produced uniform-intensity, mitochondrial distribution both in primary biliary cirrhosis and control tissue. The increased intensity of E2 in primary biliary cirrhotic tissue could be explained in terms of abnormal metabolism of E2 by biliary epithelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Liver volume, calculated from computed tomographic images, was 976 +/- 196 cm3 (range = 602 to 1,376 cm3); the parenchymal cell volume ratio, obtained based on liver histological appearance with silver stain, was 0.665 +/- 0.092 (range = 0.510 to 0.881); and the parenchymal cell volume, calculated by multiplying the liver volume with the parenchymal cell volume ratio, was 645 +/- 140 cm3 (range = 403 to 936 cm3). The total hepatocyte number obtained in a similar manner using hematoxylin-stained specimens was 1.72 +/- 0.56 x 10(11) (range = 0.74 to 2.94 x 10(11)).

  ".W": "To test whether hepatotoxicity occurring in National Cooperative Gallstone Study patients was caused by a toxic effect of chenodiol per se or of lithocholate caused by defective sulfation, bile samples were analyzed using a new high-performance liquid chromatography method that measures the proportions of the four individual lithocholate amidates (sulfated and unsulfated lithocholylglycine and lithocholyltaurine) and all common bile acid amidates. Samples were obtained from National Cooperative Gallstone Study patients (n = 17) with abnormal light microscopic liver biopsy results or major aminotransferase elevations and from a matched control group of patients (n = 14) who received similar chenodiol doses but had no evidence of liver injury. Bile samples from 45 healthy subjects were also analyzed. The analytical method was validated by showing that the percentage of chenodiol and cholic and deoxycholic acid obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography correlated highly (r greater than 0.94) with previous gas-liquid chromatography analyses of these samples by the National Cooperative Gallstone Study Reference Laboratory. No significant differences were seen between gallstone patients with and without evidence of liver injury for percent total lithocholate amidates, percent sulfated or unsulfated lithocholate amidates or percent chenodiol amidates. Lithocholate was partially sulfated in all bile samples (52% +/- 17% [mean +/- S.D., n = 50]), but the extent of sulfation varied widely between and within patients during the course of therapy. Mean values of healthy subjects were similar and also showed a wide range in the extent of lithocholate sulfation. It is concluded that (a) liver injury caused by these doses of chenodiol could not be attributed to the accumulation of unsulfated lithocholate per se in circulating bile acids; (b) liver injury appeared to be, directly or indirectly, caused by enrichment in circulating bile acids with chenodiol or chenodiol together with lithocholate, suggesting that the hepatocytes of those patients with hepatotoxicity were injured by the change induced in bile-acid metabolism by the feeding of chenodiol; and (c) about half of lithocholate amidates in bile samples were sulfated, but the extent of sulfation was highly variable both in gallstone patients and healthy subjects.\r"

We have quantified resting metabolic rate and diet-induced thermogenesis in seven patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, in seven patients after liver transplantation who had previously been diagnosed as having primary biliary cirrhosis and in seven controls. Resting metabolic rate was elevated in the primary biliary cirrhosis group (4.44 +/- 0.81 kJ/hr/kg body wt; mean +/- S.D.) compared with the post-liver-transplantation group (3.39 +/- 0.40 kJ/hr/kg body wt) (p less than 0.005) and compared with control subjects (3.65 +/- 0.23 kJ/hr/kg body wt) (p less than 0.01). A highly significant relationship was found between the severity of liver disease in the primary biliary cirrhosis group, as assessed by Child-Pugh score, and the resting metabolic rate group (r = 0.93; p less than 0.005). After a liquid meal (41 kJ/kg body wt), the metabolic rate increased, with similar peak changes from baseline occurring in all three groups. However, the rise persisted significantly longer in the primary biliary cirrhosis patients, and thus the integrated mean postprandial energy expenditure over the 4-hr postprandial observation period was greater in the primary biliary cirrhosis group than in the other two groups (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Among 597 patients with nodular hepatic lesions who underwent ultrasonically guided needle biopsy, 305 were histologically confirmed as having hepatocellular carcinoma, and 37 patients had borderline lesions. Histological reexamination was correlated with morphometrical analysis on selected cases of well-differentiated, microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 29), borderline lesion (n = 10), typical (mid-sized and macrotrabecular) hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 15) and cirrhotic liver tissue obtained from extranodular hepatic parenchyma of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (n = 47). Morphometrical analyses revealed that the mean cell size and nucleocytoplasmic ratio were most useful for distinguishing well-differentiated, microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinoma from cirrhosis. These two parameters were well correlated with nuclear density. The grade of nuclear density, therefore, seemed to be a convenient semiquantitative indicator for diagnosing well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. A comparison between intranodular and extranodular hepatic tissues was particularly important for its assessment. It is concluded from the results that hepatic nodules presenting a nuclear density larger than two times that of controls could be classified into the overt hepatocellular carcinoma group. From the statistical aspect, the possibility of microtrabecular hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered when a nodule has a nuclear density exceeding 1.3 times that of the extranodular tissue.\r"

Each man was interviewed about his sexual behavior and problems and was asked to comment on whether he felt liver disease affected his sexual function. The average age of the patients was 49 yr, and a wide variety of liver diseases was represented. Child-Pugh grading was A in 51 patients, B in 18 and C in 6; the mean duration of liver disease was 8 yr. Sexual desire, arousal and activity of patients with grade A disease were within the ranges observed in studies of healthy men of comparable age. Diminished sexual desire was reported by 2% of grade A patients and 35% of grade B and C patients (p less than 0.005). Arousal problems were noted by 16% of grade A patients, 60% of grade B patients and 67% of C patients (p less than 0.005). Loss of erection and inability to regain erection were noted by 7%, 40% and 67% of grade A, B and C patients, respectively (p less than 0.01). Premature and retarded ejaculation were more frequent in patients classed in Child-Pugh grades B and C. Frequency of coitus and orgasm were significantly higher in grade A patients than in grade B and C patients. Total and free testosterone levels were (in nanograms per milliliter) A, 677/1.78; B, 416/1.06; and C, 178/0.43 (p less than 0.002). We concluded that Child-Pugh grade A nonalcoholic liver disease in men does not affect sexual desire, function or performance. Men with disease grades B and C have significant sexual dysfunction and significant reduction of both total and free testosterone levels.\r"

Moreover, although increased portal pressure has been observed with supradopaminergic doses of dopamine in these patients, the splanchnic hemodynamic effects of low doses of dopamine have not been previously studied. Thus we studied the acute systemic, splanchnic and renal hemodynamic effects of a dopaminergic dose of dopamine (1.5 micrograms/kg body wt min) in nine cirrhotic patients. Plasma dopamine levels increased markedly from 35 +/- 20 pg/ml to 31,400 +/- 4,900 pg/ml during dopamine administration. A significant diastolic pressure decrease of 10% was associated with a 15% increase in heart rate. Cardiac output was not altered. Although dopamine significantly increased azygos blood flow by 16%, wedged and free hepatic venous pressures were not altered. Dopamine significantly increased renal blood flow by 31%, but did not change the glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that a dopaminergic dose of dopamine increases azygos blood flow but not the hepatic venous pressure gradient. Finally, although it increases renal blood flow, dopamine does not seem to have any beneficial effects on glomerular filtration rate in cirrhotic patients.\r"

Recently, hepatocyte growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor messenger RNA have been extracted from several organs of humans, rats and rabbits. This study was undertaken to comprehensively define and compare the cellular localization of hepatocyte growth factor in human and rat tissues in detail. Paraffin-embedded sections and frozen sections were examined by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antiserum to hepatocyte growth factor. The distribution of hepatocyte growth factor was almost identical in humans and rats. Strong or moderate cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for hepatocyte growth factor was present in most surface epithelia, distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, large neurons, megakaryocytes, granulocytes, exocrine pancreas, salivary glands, prostate, epididymis and trophoblast. Varying degrees of immunoreactivity were observed in endothelial cells, chondrocytes and macrophages. We conclude that hepatocyte growth factor is widely distributed in numerous tissues and cell types independent of their regenerative activity. This suggests that hepatocyte growth factor may have mitogenic and/or trophic effects on multiple cell types in addition to hepatocytes.\r"

Liver-derived lymphocytes were isolated from enzymatically digested tissue by gradient centrifugation and adherence to plastic. Their phenotypical characteristics were studied by two-color flow cytometry, and effector cell function was determined in 4-hr 51Cr-release assays against a natural killer-sensitive target, K562 (natural killer activity), natural killer-resistant Daudi line (lymphokine-activated killer activity) and by P815 line with or without phytohemagglutinin to assess lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Liver-derived lymphocytes isolated from normal liver contained equal proportions of T and natural killer lymphocytes (mean natural killer/T ratio = 0.7). CD3-CD56+CD16- natural killer cells were the main natural killer subset present in liver-derived lymphocytes, in contrast to the predominant natural killer phenotype in the circulation (CD56+CD16+). Control liver-derived lymphocytes had levels of cytotoxicity significantly greater than those of the normal peripheral-blood lymphocytes against all three targets. In contrast, liver-derived lymphocytes isolated from organs with advanced liver disease differed markedly in the natural killer/T cell ratio and levels of liver-derived lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Liver-derived lymphocytes obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma or rejecting allografts treated by immunosuppressive therapy had virtually no cytotoxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Death was predicted from the time that the regression line describing the decline in galactose elimination capacity vs. time intersected a value of 4 mg.min-1.kg-1. Thirty-one patients exhibited decreasing galactose elimination capacity; in 11 patients it remained stable and in 19 patients only one value was available. Among those patients with decreasing galactose elimination capacity, 10 died and three underwent liver transplantation; prediction of death was accurate to 7 +/- 19 mo. This criterion incorrectly predicted death in two patients with portal-vein thrombosis; otherwise, it did better than or as well as the Mayo clinic score. The latter was also tested on our patients and was found to adequately describe risk in yet another independent population of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Cox regression analysis selected only bilirubin and galactose elimination capacity, however, as independent predictors of death. We submit that serial determination of galactose elimination capacity in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis may be a useful adjunct to optimize the timing of liver transplantation and to evaluate new pharmacological treatment modalities of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Recently it was suggested that the onset of sodium retention in experimental cirrhosis in rats is related to a critical threshold of hepatic function, as assessed by the aminopyrine breath test. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether sodium retention occurred after two-thirds hepatectomy in rats and to investigate the relationship between sodium retention and changes in hepatic function associated with liver regeneration in this model. Sodium balance, creatinine clearance, serum sodium and the aminopyrine rate constant of elimination were evaluated daily for 4 days after surgery in partially hepatectomized (n = 6) and sham-operated rats (n = 6). All rats in the partial hepatectomy group exhibited sodium retention (sodium balance greater than 0.7 mmol/day) 24 hr after surgery. This was associated with a 62% reduction of the aminopyrine rate constant of elimination. Spontaneous natriuresis which occurred between 2 and 4 days after surgery, was associated with an increase in the aminopyrine rate constant of elimination (from 0.73 +/- 0.02 x 10(-2) min-1 on the last day of sodium retention to 0.95 +/- 0.04 x 10(-2) min-1 on the first day of natriuresis [p less than 0.05]). In contrast, no change in creatinine clearance occurred over the same period. A negative curvilinear association was found between sodium balance and the aminopyrine rate constant of elimination in all animals (r = -0.72, p less than 0.001). These observations indicate that natriuresis is related to the recovery of liver function, not to changes in creatinine clearance. In conclusion, the concept of a critical threshold of liver function below which sodium retention occurs has been substantiated in this model of hepatic dysfunction.\r"

Both native and neuraminidase-treated antibody entered bile intact, with the peak titers for both measured between 60 and 90 min after injection. A small part (0.38%) of the injected dose of native antibody and 1.05% of the asialo-IgM antibody appeared in bile over 24 hr. These recoveries represented only a small fraction of the activity, which apparently disappeared from serum over the period. The pathways used by IgM antibody to enter bile were partially assessed. Prior injection of fetuin was found to abrogate the biliary secretion of native antibody and to significantly reduce the recovery of asialo-antibody in bile. In contrast, the presence of asialofetuin reduced (but not significantly) the secretion of native antibody and markedly changed the kinetics of appearance of asialo-IgM activity in bile. Some candidate routes to bile can be excluded as unlikely. The parahepatocellular pathway to bile canaliculi appears uninvolved because the secretion of antibody is slow and the inhibitory effects of fetuin argue against secretory component-mediated transport. Instead, two secretory pathways appear to be present. The first appears to be available to both native and asialo-IgM antibody, and may involve the peribiliary capillary plexus. The second route to bile is available to asialo-IgM antibody alone and is probably initiated by binding to the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of intravenous administration of cyclosporine and hydrocortisone on bile flow in dogs. Cyclosporine in doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg.kg-1.hr-1 were administered along with 18 mumol/min intravenous sodium taurocholate to dogs with chronic biliary and gastric fistulas. Bile volume and bile chloride concentration and output were increased by cyclosporine in a dose-related manner, whereas bile salt concentration decreased and bile salt output was unchanged. Hydrocortisone produced small but significant increases in bile flow only at the highest dose of hydrocortisone administered. Subsequently, experiments were performed when sodium taurocholate was administered in progressively increasing doses (9, 18 and 36 mumol/min), with the dose changed every hour. Bile volume, [14C]erythritol clearance in bile and bile salt concentrations were measured with and without cyclosporine and hydrocortisone administration. Cyclosporine increased the bile salt-independent fraction of canalicular bile flow and ductular bile flow. Experiments evaluating the role of the cyclosporine carrier polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) demonstrated that this substance had no independent choleretic activity, whereas cyclosporine dissolved in ethanol and administered without Cremophor EL significantly increased bile flow. The results of this study indicate that cyclosporine stimulates chloride-rich choleresis independent of bile salt secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The hepatic levels of glutathione in rats treated with buthionine sulfoximine (4 mmol/kg), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, were 72.5% +/- 4.9% of those determined in control animals. This decrease in glutathione concentration was prevented by the administration of glutathione monoethyl ester (7.5 mmol/kg). S-Adenosyl-L-methionine-synthetase activity in the liver of rats treated with buthionine sulfoximine was 39.4% +/- 6.5% of that determined in control animals. Again, glutathione monoethyl ester prevented the effect of buthionine sulfoximine on S-adenosyl-L-methionine-synthetase activity. There was a close correlation (r = 0.936) between the hepatic levels of glutathione and S-adenosyl-L-methionine-synthetase activity. The hepatic concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in buthionine sulfoximine-treated animals was 59.7% +/- 3.7% of that measured in control rats. Contrasting with the protective effects mentioned above, glutathione monoester had no preventive action on buthionine sulfoximine-induced S-adenosyl-L-methionine depletion. Electron microscopic examination of liver samples of rats after buthionine sulfoximine administration showed evidence of liver degeneration, which was attenuated by glutathione monoethyl ester treatment. Glutathione (7.5 mmol/kg) treatment was less effective than glutathione monoethyl ester in attenuating buthionine sulfoximine effects on hepatic S-adenosyl-L-methionine metabolism and morphology. The reduction of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-synthetase activity observed after treatment with buthionine sulfoximine and its prevention by glutathione monoethyl ester, as well as the correlation between the activity of this enzyme and glutathione levels, indicate that glutathione plays an important role in maintaining S-adenosyl-L-methionine-synthetase activity in the liver.\r"

Northern-blot analysis of total cell RNA confirmed these findings and revealed a series of hepatitis D virus transcripts, including full-length genomic RNA and dimers and trimers of hepatitis D virus RNA that may represent replicative intermediates. Use of single-stranded probes showed genome-size monomers and dimers to be both of genomic and antigenomic polarity, although dimers were found to be predominantly antigenomic. These findings document the strict hepatotropism of hepatitis D virus and support the rolling-circle model of genome replication for this unique, defective RNA virus.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that vanadate ions mimic many of the actions of insulin in in vitro systems. Also, vanadate administered to diabetic hyperglycemic rats lowers their blood glucose levels to normal values. In this study we demonstrate that vanadate inhibits glucose output in the isolated perfused rat liver. Glucose production was suppressed maximally (about 50% to 60%), on addition of extremely low vanadate ion concentrations (0.5 to 1 mumol/L). This concentration is about two log units lower than the vanadate ion concentrations that are required to activate hexose uptake and glucose metabolism in vitro and is within the range of endogenous intracellular vanadium concentration. Insulin had little or no effect in inhibiting hepatic glucose output in this experimental system. The effect of vanadate ions is rapid in onset and is not accompanied by any signs of liver toxicity as assessed by various criteria. In conclusion, the study indicates that (a) vanadate ions inhibits hepatic glucose output, maximally and at extremely low, nontoxic concentrations (ID50 = 0.7 +/- 0.1 mumol/L). (b) The modulation action of the ion is fast and probably occurs at point(s) distal to the insulin receptor itself. (c) The liver participates in the process of maintaining euglycemia in diabetic rats receiving optimal doses of vanadate orally.\r"

  ".W": "16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2, a known cytoprotective agent, was examined for its ability to protect the liver against complement-mediated necrosis induced by an intravenous injection of a monoclonal antibody against a rat liver-specific antigen in rats. The hepatic injury induced by the antibody was characterized by (a) rapid development of numerous massive hemorrhagic foci of necrotic liver cells, (b) marked increases in serum liver enzyme activities and (c) pronounced reduction in the CH50 level, presumably as a result of complement consumption in the liver. Pretreatment with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 at intraperitoneal doses of 20 and 100 micrograms/kg suppressed the hepatic injury, as evidenced by markedly mitigated liver-cell necrosis and much smaller increases in the serum-enzyme activities compared with the values in diseased control animals. The prostaglandin analogue failed to prevent serum complement consumption in response to the antibody injection or affect the CH50 level at the preinjury stage, indicating that neither complement inactivation nor interference with the antigen-antibody reaction was involved in the hepatic protection. The hepatoprotective doses of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 produced a significant increase in liver cyclic AMP content in a dose-related manner. In addition, intravenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP at 3 and 10 mg/kg dose-dependently prevented histological and biochemical changes in the hepatic damage without altering the rate of reduction in serum complement activity. Like 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not affect the preinjury CH50 level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A four-week course of electrically elicited co-contraction of the thigh muscles resulted in significant attenuation of the characteristic loss of strength of the quadriceps as compared with volitional exercise. There was no significant difference between groups in any measure of performance of the hamstring muscles. In the group that received neuromuscular electrical stimulation, the values for cadence, walking velocity, stance time of the involved limb, and flexion-excursion of the knee during stance were significantly different from those of the volitional exercise group. Flexion-excursion of the knee during stance was directly and significantly correlated with strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle. Flexion of the knee during stance was qualitatively different in the involved extremity as compared with the uninvolved extremity in all patients. There is a rapid flexion of the knee at weight acceptance that is maintained throughout stance and probably reflects stabilization of the joint by muscular coactivation to compensate for weakness of the quadriceps. The patients who received neuromuscular electrical stimulation had stronger quadriceps muscles and more normal gait patterns than those in the volitional exercise group.\r"

In Group II, the tourniquet remained inflated throughout the operation, but no splint was applied postoperatively, and continuous passive motion was started immediately in the recovery room. In Group III, the tourniquet was released intraoperatively, and hemostasis was achieved by cauterization; postoperatively, a compressive dressing was applied, and a splint was used for three days. In Group IV, the tourniquet was released intraoperatively, hemostasis was established, and then the tourniquet was reinflated; a compressive dressing was applied, and continuous passive motion was started immediately in the recovery room. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were monitored in all patients. Blood loss in suction drainage was recorded, and the total blood loss was calculated. The results show that total knee arthroplasty is associated with major loss of blood (mean, 1518 milliliters). The calculated blood loss for Groups I, II, and III averaged 1443 milliliters, while that for Group IV averaged 1793 milliliters. Loss in suction drainage correlated with total estimated blood loss and averaged 511 milliliters. The magnitude of blood loss after total knee arthroplasty should be appreciated, and special attention should be paid to the availability of adequate fluid and blood products, preferably blood donated by the patient preoperatively.\r"

The three groups were similar with regard to mean age, sex ratio, duration of preoperative hospitalization, underlying risk factors, and type of operation. The rates of wound infection were not significantly different in the three groups (p = 0.8) or when the rates were stratified according to the type of operation (p greater than 0.3). Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacilli were the most common infecting microorganisms. The rate of mortality related to infection was similar in all three groups (p = 0.2).

Fourteen hips in fourteen patients had an intraoperative episode during which the joint was penetrated by the guide-pin assembly or cannulated screw, or both. This penetration was corrected at the time of the operation. Eleven patients were followed for a minimum of two years (mean, thirty-nine months; range, twenty-four to sixty-three months). All physes went on to closure. None of the patients had clinical or radiographic evidence of chondrolysis. Transient penetration of the hip joint did not lead to chondrolysis in this series. This suggests that a single episode of penetration by a pin or screw, with immediate removal from the joint, is not associated with the development of chondrolysis.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the results of 3126 consecutive total hip replacements and identified postoperative neuropathy in the ipsilateral lower extremity after fifty-three (1.7 per cent) over-all and after 1.3 per cent of the primary arthroplasties. The prevalence was 5.2 per cent after the primary arthroplasties that had been done for congenital dislocation or dysplasia of the hip and 3.2 per cent after the revisions (all diagnoses). Thus, these two types of operations were risk factors (p less than 0.01). Limb-lengthening only partially accounted for the increased prevalence of neuropathy after these procedures. The sciatic nerve was involved in all but five extremities. The cause of the palsy was unclear or unknown in thirty (57 per cent) of the extremities. When the patients were last seen, at a minimum of one year and a maximum of sixteen and one-half years after the operation, seven extremities were normal neurologically, thirty-three had a mild neurological deficit, and thirteen had a major deficit. All patients who had complete recovery of neurological function had it by twenty-one months. Of thirty-six extremities that were evaluated at a minimum of twenty-four months after the operation, seven were neurologically normal, twenty-three had a mild persistent deficit, and six had a major persistent deficit. The ability to walk decreased for all patients who had a nerve palsy. The greatest disability was in the patients who had been forty-eight years old or less and had had a primary total hip replacement (p = 0.037). The prognosis for neurological recovery was related to the degree to which the nerve was damaged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At a minimum of two years (average, five years and eight months) after the operation, thirty-one patients (thirty-four shoulders) were available for review. The results, which were rated on the basis of pain, function, range of motion, strength, and the satisfaction of the patient, were excellent for twenty-five shoulders, good for four, fair for three, and poor for one. Four of the five least satisfactory results were in patients who had had a long-standing massive tear of the rotator cuff. This study was done to separate the criticism of the operative procedure of total acromionectomy from an avoidable complication of that procedure, retraction of the deltoid, and to describe the specific advantages and satisfactory results that occur when that complication is avoided. It is my opinion that failure to repair the deltoid adequately results in retraction of that muscle, and that this avoidable complication is responsible for the unfavorable reputation of total acromionectomy.\r"

In order to determine the complications that occur when a Bristow procedure fails, and how they should be managed, we retrospectively evaluated forty shoulders in thirty-nine patients who had been treated by the senior one of us for a failed Bristow procedure from 1977 to 1987. The complications of the index Bristow procedures included recurrent painful anterior instability, injury to the articular cartilage, failure of the coracoid bone-block to unite with the glenoid, loosening of the screw, neurovascular injury, and posterior instability. The primary etiology of failure of the index Bristow procedure was excessive laxity of the capsule in thirty-two shoulders (80 per cent) that were affected by chronic, painful anterior or posterior instability. An untreated Perthes-Bankart lesion was present in the remaining eight shoulders (20 per cent). The use of anterior reconstruction for the revision of a failed Bristow procedure is a difficult operation that necessitates meticulous technique. As our over-all plan of treatment resulted in a good or excellent outcome in only 50 per cent of the patients, we do not recommend the Bristow procedure for primary treatment of symptomatic anterior instability of the shoulder.\r"

We correlated the functional result with the integrity of the cuff, as determined by ultrasonography. Eighty per cent of the repairs of a tear involving only the supraspinatus tendon were intact at the time of the most recent follow-up, while more than 50 per cent of the repairs of a tear involving more than the supraspinatus tendon had a recurrent defect. Older patients and patients in whom a larger tear had been repaired had a greater prevalence of recurrent defects. At the time of the most recent follow-up, most of the patients were more comfortable and were satisfied with the result of the repair, even when they had sonographic evidence of a recurrent defect. The shoulders in which the repaired cuff was intact at the time of follow-up had better function during activities of daily living and a better range of active flexion (129 +/- 20 degrees compared with 71 +/- 41 degrees) compared with the shoulders that had a large recurrent defect. Similar correlations were noted for the range of active external and internal rotation and for strength of flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. In the shoulders in which the cuff was not intact, the degree of functional loss was related to the size of the recurrent defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Initially, the load creates fractures in the zone of calcified cartilage, with minimum damage to the articular cartilage surface. Surface fissures were visible in all patellae only after staining with India ink. Histologically, these surface clefts extended into the transitional or superficial radial zone, and they did not communicate with the subchondral bone except in two patellae. However, there were reproducible clefts in the region of the subchondral bone and the zone of calcified cartilage in all patellae. Six months after loading, there was a loss of safranin-O staining above the deep clefts, and there was new-bone formation in the subchondral region and fibrillation of the cartilaginous surface. Thus, the initial changes had progressed to osteoarthrotic-like conditions at six months. In this animal model, the joint is not invaded and the changes that result from loading are reproducible. The injury to the joint creates superficial disruption of the cartilage and subchondral changes that lead to arthritic-like degeneration of the cartilage within six months.\r"

  ".W": "No effective hormonal contraceptive has yet been devised for men. Through their suppressive effect on gonadotropin secretion, GnRH antagonists inhibit both testosterone (T) production and spermatogenesis in animals. Long term administration of an antagonist alone would result in androgen deficiency; this would cause unacceptable physiological and behavioral sequellae in men. Therefore, androgen replacement must be included in any GnRH antagonist regimen used in human male contraception. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of a GnRH antagonist plus T would suppress spermatogenesis in the male primate to azoospermic levels while maintaining normal serum T levels. We examined the effects of the GnRH antagonist Deterelix [N-Ac-DNal(2)1-DpCl-Phe2-DTrp3-DhArg(Et2)6 -DAla10-GnRH], alone and with simultaneous T replacement, on sperm production and serum T levels in adult male monkeys (n = 22). After 12 weeks of daily sc antagonist injection, all animals that received antagonist alone (n = 5) and those that 750 micrograms/kg.day antagonist plus T (n = 5) were azoospermic. After 16 weeks, four of five animals that received 250 micrograms/kg.day antagonist plus T became azoospermic. Control animals (n = 7) received daily injections of vehicle; sperm counts increased somewhat during the study period in that group. Castrate range T levels were achieved in animals receiving antagonist alone. T levels in the groups that received T supplementation and in the control group were in the normal male range throughout the treatment period. Sperm counts returned to the pretreatment range in all animals during the recovery period. We conclude that the combination of a GnRH antagonist plus T can induce azoospermia reversibly in this nonhuman primates species, and that a similar combination may be an effective contraceptive regimen in men. The GnRH antagonist alone may be an effective treatment for androgen-dependent neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular localization of the alpha-, beta A-, and beta B-subunits of inhibin was studied in human corpora lutea (CL) during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Immunohistochemical techniques using antisera selective for each subunit were used to localize the polypeptide chains. Immunoreactive staining with antisera against the alpha-, beta A-, and beta B-subunits was mainly observed in granulosa luteal cells (luteal cells), whereas thecal luteal cells were faintly stained with antibodies selective for each inhibin subunit. The intensity of immunostaining with alpha-subunit antiserum in luteal cells increased from the early luteal phase to the midluteal phase and subsequently decreased toward the late luteal phase. Inhibin alpha-subunit in the retrogressive CL was not detected. Not only was the immunolocalization of both beta A- and beta B-subunits detected in the luteal cells of the CL of the cycle, but the relative intensity of immunostaining with beta-subunit antiserum changed in a pattern similar to that shown by the alpha-subunit. The luteal cells and thecal luteal cells in the CL of pregnancy exhibited positive staining with antisera directed against each inhibin subunit. The present findings provide further evidence that 1) immunoreactive inhibin subunits are present in luteal cells in the CL of the menstrual cycle; 2) the detectable level of each subunit changes in parallel with the function of the CL over the course of the menstrual cycle; and 3) the CL of pregnancy might be involved in serum inhibin elevation early in gestation.\r"

It has also been implicated in calcium regulation during fetal development. In this study immunohistochemical techniques, using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to synthetic PTHrP peptides, have been used to localize PTHrP in human fetal tissues from one fetus of 7 weeks and two of approximately 18 and 20 weeks gestation, respectively, in order to identify sites of potential functional significance. PTHrP immunoreactivity was identified in epithelia from many sources, including skin, bronchus, pancreas, pharynx, gut, stomach, and renal pelvis. Thyroid and parathyroid glands, which develop from epithelial origins, also stained positive for PTHrP, as did kidney collecting tubules, adrenal tissue, and skeletal and smooth muscle. PTHrP immunoreactivity was also located in developing long bones and calvaria, where it may have relevance in bone turnover during fetal development. The role of PTHrP at these locations remains to be elucidated, but the identification of specific PTHrP immunoreactivity in fetal epithelia is consistent with PTHrP production by cancers of epithelial origin and supports the hypothesis that PTHrP may have a role in epithelial growth and differentiation.\r"

Basal CORT and ACTH levels were indistinguishable between runners and sedentary controls, whereas CORT responses to hCRH were significantly increased in endurance athletes, and ACTH responses tended to be higher in this group. Comparing the dexamethasone/hCRH test results of the runners with those of an age-matched sample of previously studied depressed patients (n = 9), similar hormone responses to CRH challenge were noted. The mechanisms underlying these alterations may either be a stepwise decrease in corticotropic sensitivity to the negative feedback signal leading to a switch to positive glucocorticoid feedback, an enhanced cosecretion of ACTH secretagogues such as vasopressin, or a combination of both. In conclusion, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis physiology seems to be determined by previous stressful events associated with hypercortisolemia, regardless of its etiology.\r"

Immunoreactive angiotensin-II (ANG-II) consisted mainly of ANG-(1-8) octapeptide (greater than 65%), variable proportions (15-25%) of ANG-(4-8) pentapeptide, and small to negligible proportions of ANG-(2-8) heptapeptide and ANG-(3-8) hexapeptide. Levels of ANG-(1-8) were significantly higher in women with normal pregnancy than in both nonpregnant women (P less than 0.0006) and women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (P less than 0.008); in the latter, levels were lower with increasing severity of disease. Levels of ANG-(4-8) were higher in women with normal pregnancy than in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension or nonpregnant women. When expressed as a proportion of ANG-(1-8) levels, however, ANG-(4-8) levels were not higher in normal pregnancy than in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension or nonpregnant women. It is concluded that the well known increase in ANG-II levels in normal pregnancy relates predominantly to the active ANG-(1-8) octapeptide and to a far lesser extent to the smaller ANG peptides. Similarly, lower ANG-II levels in pregnancy-induced hypertension relate predominantly to lower ANG-(1-8) levels.\r"

Subjects were readmitted at intervals and given increasing doses of oral dexamethasone (0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1 mg) at midnight, followed by repeat blood sampling from 0400-0800 h and oCRH testing. We compared mean hormone levels for the entire 12-h and three component 4-h periods of the basal visit, and for each 4-h dexamethasone visit using the Mann-Whitney U test and repeated measures analysis of variance. Pulsatile secretion was characterized using the Pulsar computer program. Basal mean 12-h and 4-h ACTH and cortisol values did not differ with age (P greater than 0.1). Pulse analysis revealed no age change in the corresponding values for peak frequency, amplitude, or duration for either hormone examined. Increasing doses of dexamethasone produced progressive inhibition of mean ACTH and cortisol levels (P less than 0.001) as well as decreased (P less than 0.01) pulse frequency, amplitude, and duration with no age differences (P greater than 0.1). ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH were progressively suppressed by increasing doses of dexamethasone (P less than 0.02) and did not differ between age groups (P greater than 0.3) except for a slightly higher peak cortisol response (P = 0.05) in the older men at the 0.3 mg dexamethasone dose. We conclude that basal and oCRH-stimulated ACTH and cortisol secretion, as well as sensitivity of the ACTH-cortisol axis to glucocorticoid feedback suppression, are essentially unaltered with age in healthy men.\r"

  ".W": "This study was initiated to 1) assess gemfibrozil's ability to lower plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration in patients with NIDDM, and 2) determine whether this effect was associated with any changes in glycemic control. Measurements were made of mean hourly plasma glucose, insulin, TG, and FFA concentrations from 1200-1600 h in response to a test meal; hepatic glucose production (HGP); insulin-stimulated glucose uptake during a hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp study (MCR); and fasting plasma lipoprotein TG and cholesterol concentrations in 12 patients with NIDDM before and 3 months after gemfibrozil treatment. Although ambient plasma TG and FFA concentrations fell significantly, plasma glucose, insulin, HGP, concentrations fell significantly, plasma glucose, insulin, HGP, and glucose MCR did not change. However, when patients were divided into two groups, those with fasting plasma glucose levels above 9 mmol/L (fair control) and those with levels below 9 mmol/L (good control), a different phenomenon was observed. Patients in fair control had significant decreases in mean hourly plasma concentrations of glucose (15.1 +/- 1.7 to 12.6 +/- 0.9 mmol/L; P less than 0.001), insulin (523 +/- 59 to 471 +/- 75 pmol/L; P less than 0.001), FFA (652 +/- 150 to 504 +/- 76 mumol/L), and HGP (9.5 0.4 to 8.1 +/- 0.4 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.005), and an increase in glucose MCR (2.63 +/- 0.49 to 3.72 +/- 0.54 mL/kg.min; P less than 0.07) in association with a fall in TG from 6.9 +/- 1.3 to 3.5 +/- 0.9 mmol/L (P less than 0.001). Although fasting low density lipoprotein cholesterol increased (1.8 +/- 0.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/L; P less than 0.05), the ratio of total to high density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased (6.84 +/- 0.88 to 5.80 +/- 1.05; P less than 0.02). Despite a significant fall in mean hourly TG concentration (4.6 +/- 0.7 to 3.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/L; P less than 0.001), neither insulin, FFA, HGP, nor glucose MCR changed in patients in good control. Furthermore, the mean hourly plasma glucose concentration increased from 9.2 +/- 0.7 to 11.7 +/- 1.4 mmol/L (P less than 0.001). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol also increased in this group (1.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/L; P less than 0.02), but, as before, the ratio of total to high density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased (8.15 +/- 1.93 to 6.36 +/- 1.03; P less than 0.02).\r"

  ".W": "The predictive value of three different RIAs of PTH for the diagnosis of the histological type of bone disease has been compared in 24 asymptomatic patients on chronic hemodialysis who had never been exposed to aluminum intoxication and who agreed to have a bone biopsy after double tetracycline labeling. The serum concentrations of PTH were measured using a two-site immunoradiometric assay for intact PTH(1-84) and region specific assays directed against the C-terminal (53-84) fragment or the midregion (44-68) of the molecule. The bone histomorphometric analysis showed that six patients had nonaluminic adynamic bone disease with low bone formation rate (BFR), eight had mild hyperparathyroidism characterized by increased bone resorption and normal BFR, nine had severe hyperparathyroidism with increased BFR, and only one had true osteomalacia with increased osteoid seam thickness. All PTH assays correlated with the various parameters of bone resorption and bone formation and were able to differentiate the histological type of bone disease only when groups of patients were considered. For classifying individual patients into severe hyperparathyroidism and adynamic bone disease groups, the intact PTH assay had the best predictive value with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of at least 70%. A nonaluminic adynamic bone disease was observed in more than 50% of the patients who had normal intact PTH levels (6/11). It is concluded that the intact PTH measurement is superior to C-terminal and midregion assays for the prediction of the histological type of bone disease in hemodialyzed patients and should be of considerable value to adapt their treatment in order to avoid the emergence of both severe hyperparathyroidism and adynamic bone disease. In the absence of aluminum intoxication it seems that maintaining intact PTH concentrations 1 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal would correspond to the best bone histology.\r"

We observed a significant decrease in lumbar bone loss in relation to the calcium supplementation (mean loss after 2 yr of 3.5% in the control group vs. 1.3% and 0.7% in the 1000 and 2000 mg groups, respectively), a significant increase in urinary calcium excretion, and a significant decrease in the urinary hydroxyproline/creatine ratio, serum alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The effect of calcium supplementation on lumbar bone loss was significant in the first year of supplementation, but not in the second. However, the urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio and the serum alkaline phosphatase level remained significantly decreased in the treatment groups at the end of the study; this was not the case for serum osteocalcin. Calcium supplementation did not have a significant effect on metacarpal cortical bone loss. The difference in biochemical parameters between the 2 supplementation groups was small. No significant interaction was observed between the menopausal status of the subjects and the effect of calcium supplementation. We conclude that calcium supplementation retards lumbar bone loss in the first year of calcium supplementation by reducing bone turnover. However, the effect on lumbar bone loss over a longer time span is still uncertain.\r"

However, results from subsequent studies were less consistent. These discrepancies resulted in part from limited sample sizes causing diagnostic heterogeneity. In the present study we examined hormonal response patterns during the ITT in 25 bipolar patients (19 depressed and 6 hypomanic), 91 unipolar depressives, and 51 healthy volunteers to determine whether distinct neuroendocrine response patterns characterized specific diagnostic subgroups. We measured the glucose, GH, PRL, and cortisol responses during a 75-min ITT and observed a diminished cumulative GH response in bipolar hypomanic patients compared to bipolar depressives (P = 0.004) and healthy volunteers (P less than 0.001), and a larger cumulative GH response in bipolar depressives compared to unipolar patients (P = 0.02). No differences were observed in either PRL or cortisol responses among subject groups. The present findings suggest that GH responses during the ITT may be more complex than initially described and partially dependent upon affective disorder subtype. Thus, bipolar patients may have distinctive GH response patterns compared to those of unipolar depressives and healthy controls. Moreover, some of the difference observed in the GH response to the ITT may result from the phase of the manic-depressive illness. These data indicate differences in neuroendocrine substrates between affective disorder subtypes.\r"

We administered the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT, 500 mg at 800 and 1000 h) to five women in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and compared LH secretion patterns to those in five untreated controls. Commencing at 800 h, blood was drawn every 15 min for LH and PRL measurements until 1600 h. AMPT elevated PRL concentrations (mean +/- SEM) from a baseline of 14.72 +/- 2.51 micrograms/L to a peak of 102.2 +/- 24 micrograms/L. LH concentrations [21.97 +/- 0.56 (AMPT) vs. 13.51 +/- 0.16 IU/L (control), P less than 0.0001], LH area under the curve [11014 +/- 1815 (AMPT) vs. 7009 +/- 404 IU.min/L (control), P = 0.05] and LH pulse amplitude [9.99 +/- 2.38 (AMPT) vs. 4.03 +/- 0.61 IU/L (control), P = 0.04] were all greater in the group in which catecholamine synthesis was inhibited. There was no difference in pulse frequency between the groups (7.4 +/- 0.51 vs. 6.6 +/- 0.24 pulses/8 h, P greater than 0.05). We conclude 1) inhibition of endogenous catecholamine synthesis augments LH levels in the early follicular phase, and 2) increased LH secretion during catecholamine synthesis inhibition is due, at least in part, to increased LH pulse amplitude but not increased LH pulse frequency.\r"

  ".W": "Maximizing peak bone mass is advocated as a way to prevent osteoporosis. As a prerequisite to the elaboration of any preventive program aimed at maximizing peak bone mass, it is important to determine how the rate of skeletal growth at clinically relevant sites, such as lumbar spine and femoral neck, proceeds in relation to age and pubertal stages in both sexes. Bone mass was assessed in 207 healthy caucasian boys and girls, aged 9-18 yr. Bone mineral density (BMD; grams per cm2) and content (BMC; grams) were determined in lumbar spine (L2-L4), femoral neck (FN), and midfemoral shaft (FS), using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Bone variables were correlated with both chronological age and pubertal stage, and compared with young adult (20-35 yr) reference values. The main results are: 1) in males, compared to females, there was a marked age-related delay in L2-L4 BMD or BMC increase, but no delay was observed in relation to pubertal stages; 2) at the end of the rapid growth spurt, trends for higher mean values in males were observed for L2-L4 BMC, FN BMD, and particularly FS BMD, but no sex difference was observed for L2-L4 BMD; 3) in females, but not in males, a dramatic reduction in bone mass growth was observed after 15 yr of age, particularly for L2-L4 BMD/BMC and FN BMD. This sharp reduction occurred between the second and fourth years after menarche. In the 14- to 15-yr-old female group, BMD in L2-L4, FN, and FS corresponded to 99.2%, 105.1%, and 94.1%, respectively, and BMC in L2-L4 to 97.6% of the mean values recorded in 20- to 35-yr-old women. In conclusion, this cross-sectional study indicates that during pubertal development, major differences are observed in bone mass growth according to sex and skeletal site. Whereas in males bone mass at different skeletal sites continues to increase substantially between 15-18 yr, skeletal mass growth appears to dramatically slow down at the levels of both lumbar spine and FN at 15-16 yr of age in female adolescents. This suggests that the generally accepted notion that in both males and females bone mass continues to substantially accumulate at all skeletal sites until the fourth decade may not be a constant in human physiology.\r"

In order to characterize it, we have used the euglycemic clamp technique on six normal volunteers, two patients with acanthosis nigricans and insulin resistance (AN), and one patient with idiopathic nonazotemic hyperkalemia (HK). In the basal state, all patients had normal fasting blood sugar, the AN patients had fasting hyperinsulinemia (600% of controls), and the HK patient had an elevated plasma potassium level of 5.1 mmol/L (n = 4.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/L). During low dose (1 mU/kg.min), and high dose (10 mU/kg.min) insulin infusions, normals used glucose at a rate of 220 +/- 10 and 470 +/- 20 mg/M2.min, respectively. The HK patient had a normal glucose use at both infusion rates, but the AN patients had a 20% decrease of glucose use compared to normals at the two infusion rates. In normal patients, plasma potassium fell by 0.7 and 1.4 mmol/L at the end of the two infusion periods, respectively. AN patients had a similar fall in potassium, but the HK patient displayed no change in plasma potassium levels during a low dose insulin infusion, and only a 0.6 mmol/L drop during the high dose insulin infusion. These results indicate that: 1) patients with AN are resistant to insulin action on glucose use, 2) AN patients have a normal response to insulin on potassium uptake, 3) HK is a patient with normal response to insulin on glucose use, and 4) this patient is resistant to insulin action on potassium uptake. In conclusion: 1) we have demonstrated the independence of insulin action on glucose and potassium uptake in vivo, 2) we documented the existence of selective insulin resistance in the above patients, 3) we speculate, that in patients with a normal response to insulin on one parameter of its actions, and subnormal response on another parameter, a postreceptor defect rather than a receptor abnormality must exist.\r"

We performed this study in order to determine the actual histological prevalence of AN and its relationship to sex hormone levels and insulin action. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal was determined by the euglycemic clamp technique, and neck or axillary skin biopsies were graded blind for the presence and severity of AN in lean and obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) and in age- and weight-matched normal ovulatory controls. AN was present on clinical examination in 11 of 13 obese PCO, 3 of 6 lean PCO, 4 of 14 obese normal, and 0 of 4 lean normal women. AN was present on histological examination in 13 of 13 obese PCO, 5 of 6 lean PCO, 13 of 14 obese normal, and 1 of 4 lean normal women. The severity of histological AN was most highly correlated with insulin-mediated glucose disposal (r = -0.61; P less than 0.001) rather than fasting (r = 0.46; P less than 0.05) or glucose-stimulated insulin levels (r = 0.48; P less than 0.01). The only sex steroid correlated with histological AN was dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (r = 0.46; P less than 0.01). We conclude that 1) clinical skin examination was very insensitive for detecting AN; 2) the best biochemical correlate of histological AN was decreased insulin action, rather than insulin or androgen levels per se; and 3) AN is a very common epiphenomenon of insulin resistance, and its clinical presence should not be used as a criterion for stratifying hyperandrogenic women.\r"

  ".W": "TSH secretion, with particular regard to the nocturnal TSH surge, was evaluated in 115 subjects with non-toxic nodular goiter. All patients were clinically and biochemically euthyroid. After 18-36 months of follow-up (mean, 24 months), hyperthyroidism occurred in 21 (18%; group 1), while the remaining 94 remained euthyroid (82%; group II). The analysis of hormonal data at the time of first observation showed that the 2 groups had similar total and free T4 and T3 serum concentrations. Morning serum TSH values in group I were lower than those in group II patients (0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1 mU/L; P less than 0.001); this difference was even more striking for the nocturnal values (0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.2 mU/L; P less than 0.0001); nocturnal values were significantly lower than morning values in group II, but not in group I. The mean peak TSH value after TRH was also significantly reduced in group I (5.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 9.2 +/- 0.7 mU/L; P less than 0.001). Morning TSH values in group II did not differ from those in controls (1.3 +/- 0.1 mU/L), whereas nocturnal and TRH stimulated peak TSH values were slightly but significantly lower. The nocturnal serum TSH values in control subjects were 62-390% higher than morning values. The nocturnal TSH surge was abolished in 18 of 21 (86%) group I patients and in 7 of 94 (8%) group II patients. TRH testing resulted in an absent or blunted TSH responses in 5 subjects in group I and 6 in group II. Analysis by the Galen and Gambino predictive model; comparing the abolition of the nocturnal TSH surge and the abnormal TRH test as predictors of the subsequent occurrence of hyperthyroidism, showed that the former had higher sensitivity (86% vs. 24%) and predictivity (72% vs. 45%). In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that the evaluation of the nocturnal TSH surge may be useful in identifying patients with nontoxic nodular goiter in whom hyperthyroidism may eventually occur. Patients who lack the nocturnal serum TSH surge are more prone to develop thyroid hyperfunction; their thyroid status should, therefore, be more carefully and frequently monitored.\r"
