  ".W": "Serum albumin was measured in 126 men (average age 70.6; range 40 to 96) of a Veterans Administration Nursing Home, and was correlated with other items in an extensive clinical data base, including death or survival during the year after the analysis. The reason for institutionalization was chronic neurologic disease or other disabling physical condition in 63 men (group A), and psychiatric disorder in 63 men (group B). In group A, the proportions of men with albumin less than 3.5, 3.5-4.0, and greater than 4.0 g/dl were 6%, 37%, and 57%, respectively. In this group, the serum albumin level was significantly (p less than 0.05) correlated with death rate, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum cholesterol, and serum lactic dehydrogenase. The death rate in group A during the year after the albumin analysis was 25%. For the patients with albumin level less than 3.5, 3.5-4.0, and greater than 4.0 g/dl, the death rates were 50%, 43%, and 11% respectively (p less than 0.01 for comparison of the former two groups with the latter). The subgroup with albumin 3.5-4.0 g/dl represented only 37% of the men in group A, but accounted for 63% of the group's deaths. In group B, serum albumin level was not significantly correlated with any other clinical variable. Death rate during the year after the albumin analysis was only 2% in group B, and did not correlate with the albumin level. These data indicate that, in nonpsychiatric Nursing Home men, the desirable level for the serum albumin concentration is higher than 3.5 g/dl.\r"

Maximal proteinuric response was observed between 7 and 14 days. Prior to sacrifice, they received injections of conjugated or unconjugated anti-heparan-sulfate-proteoglycan antibody, directed against its core protein (Mr = 18,000). Their kidneys were processed for direct and indirect immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase, tannic-acid staining, and tissue autoradiography (ARG). By tannic-acid staining, antibody binding sites identical to the anionic sites described previously were discovered. No qualitative differences were observed by these immunohistochemical techniques. Quantitative tissue ARG did not reveal any statistical differences in the binding of antibody between the control and nephrotic groups. For de novo biosynthetic studies, rats were sacrificed on day 10. Their kidneys were utilized for labeling of basement membrane PGs by employing [35S]-sulfate as the precursor product. Tissue ARG, as well as biochemical studies, were performed on the radiolabeled glomeruli. PGs were extracted with 4 M GuCl and characterized by Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. There was an overall increase in the total incorporated radioactivities in the glomerular and media fractions. No differences were observed in the macromolecular size characteristics of intact PGs and glycosaminoglycan chains of either glomerular or media fractions. However, an increase in the charge-density characteristics was observed in PGs of the nephrotic group. By tissue ARG, an increase in the grain densities over the basement membrane and mesangial matrices of the glomerulus was noted. These data indicate that the intact PGs, their chains and core protein do not undergo significant biochemical alterations; however, de novo synthesized PGs have higher charge-density characteristics which may be related to a higher degree of sulfation that occurs during the course of aminonucleoside nephrosis.\r"

  ".W": "With an aim to investigate the relative sensitivity of various renal structures to allograft rejection, we analyzed the histochemical reaction intensity of seven enzymes prominently displayed in various rat kidney components, and correlated the expression of these enzymes both to the degree of intra-graft inflammation and to the expression of class II MHC antigens in graft capillary endothelial cells. Syngeneic transplants and normal renal tissue were used as controls. At the peak of inflammation, on the fifth day after transplantation, adenosine triphosphatase activity of vascular endothelial cells was strongly reduced in the peritubular capillary endothelium of the allograft, moderately in the glomerular endothelium but very little in the endothelium of arteries and veins. Lactate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities were moderately reduced in the proximal tubular cells of the allograft and even less in the distal tubular cells. The results suggest that the prime target of the host immune attack is the intertubular capillary endothelium, whereas the distal tubular cells are relatively insensitive to immune injury.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable evidence indicates that the connecting tubule cells, a type of cell of the distal nephron which seems to participate on potassium secretion, may be the place where renal kallikrein is synthetized. As potassium secretion and kallikrein synthesis may occur in the same cells, we studied the effect of high potassium diet on renal kallikrein production. The kallikrein containing cells from rats fed a normal and high potassium diet were evaluated using a combination of morphometric analysis, conventional electron microscopy, and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry. High potassium diet produced hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the kallikrein containing cells. Hyperplasia was sustained by an increased number of immunoreactive cells/mm2 (151 +/- 14 vs. 86.4 +/- 12, P less than 0.01), an increased number of binucleated immunoreactive cells/mm2 (11.90 +/- 2.1 vs. 3.77 +/- 0.17, P less than 0.005), and by the presence of mitosis. Cell hypertrophy was sustained by an increased cross-sectional area of immunoreactive cells (mu 2) (320.4 +/- 21 vs. 104.5 +/- 6.1, P less than 0.001), by an increased area of basal plasma membrane infoldings, by an hypertrophy of the components of the Golgi complex, hypertrophy of the components of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and by a larger number of secretory-like vesicles containing kallikrein. The rats fed with high potassium diet had higher values on urinary kallikrein excretion-amidase activity (3.70 +/- 0.51 vs. 2.01 +/-0.37 units/day, P less than 0.02), higher values on potassium excretion (18.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 1.31 +/- 0.1 mmol/day, P less than 0.001), and higher urinary volume (51.5 +/- 5.3 vs. 12.2 +/- 1.6 ml/day, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied 99 living related allograft donors with follow-up information of at least 10 years and the 50 recipients who had successful outcomes. Recipients were younger and had significantly lower blood pressures at follow-up than their donors. Borderline and definite hypertension were present in 22.2% and 4.0% of donors prior to donation, in 14.4% and 21.1% of donors at follow-up, and in 2.0% and 18.0% of the 50 recipients at follow-up. Age, relative weight, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) prior to donation were the key variables in predicting the follow-up ranked MAP of the donors. CPAH prior to donation was inversely correlated with the age of the donors and, indirectly, with the follow-up MAP. Donor CPAH prior to donation was significantly correlated with the renal allograft function of the recipients but not with the recipient ranked MAP at follow-up. No correlation of the ranked MAP or blood pressure outcome categories between donors and recipients was found. We conclude that donation of one kidney can accelerate the development of hypertension in those donors with predisposition to develop hypertension. In addition, the predisposition of the donors to develop hypertension and their age, within the range observed in the study, does not significantly influence the long-term blood pressure status of the recipient.\r"

Subsequent review of the bone marrow material indicated cytologic features consistent with either an embryonal, undifferentiated small cell mesenchymal malignancy or reticulo-endothelial malignancy. Ultimately, the electron microscopic (EM) study of the tumor proved to be diagnostic of rhabdomyosarcoma. An extensive search for a primary site of rhabdomyosarcoma did not show any lesion, although the genitourinary region was clinically suspected. The clinical course was a rapidly downhill one with extensive bone and CNS involvement. The patient died 5 months later. An autopsy permit was not obtained. This case emphasizes the occasional tendency of rhabdomyosarcoma to masquerade as a hematopoietic malignancy at the time of presentation and the usefulness of EM study in confirming a diagnosis.\r"

A novel peptide, 37 aminoacids long, termed diabetes-associated peptide (DAP), has been identified in amyloid-containing pancreatic extracts from 3 type-2 diabetic patients but not in extracts from 6 non-diabetic subjects. DAP has major homology with calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) and the islet amyloid of all 22 diabetics showed CGRP immunoreactivity. The immunoreactivity was inhibited by preabsorption of three different CGRP antisera either with CGRP carboxyterminal peptide 28-37 or with extracted DAP. Both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects had CGRP/DAP immunoreactivity in islet B-cells. Electron microscopy of islets containing amyloid indicated fibrillar amyloid between the endocrine cells and capillaries, usually penetrating into deep invaginations of the plasma membrane of the B-cells. These results suggest that islet amyloid contains DAP, which may originate from B-cells. Accumulation of amyloid in islets is likely to impair islet function and may be a causal factor in the development of type-2 diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "The collection of genes known as the major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC) appears to subserve three functions. Firstly, its class I genes, coding for antigens on all nucleated cells, assist clones of cytotoxic T cells to kill virus-infected cells quickly, without being muffled by the myriad numbers of free virus particles. Secondly, the absence of autoimmunity to both class I and class II MHC antigens shows that they impose unbreakable tolerances on the immune repertoire. The class II antigens, which are confined to B lymphocytes (if their apparent occurrence on other dividing cells is a cross-reaction), may have the sole function of tolerance induction, supplementing this activity of the class I antigens. Both sets of MHC antigens serve to diversify immunity-repertoire gaps among individuals of a population, thus hampering epidemic spread of infection and providing a diversity of immunoreactivity that favours survival of at least some members of a population in the face of pestilence. Thirdly, the permanence of the MHC tolerance inductions affords a powerful, adaptable mechanism for curtailment of reproductively disadvantageous autoimmune disease liable to arise through somatic mutations in lymphocytes multiplying under drive from a microbial antigenic stimulus.\r"

The outbreak involved three intensive care units (54 isolates), and spread from one unit to another and then to four wards (8 isolates). K pneumoniae of various serotypes and strains of different Enterobacteriaceae demonstrating the same antibiotic resistance pattern were isolated, which suggests dissemination of an R-factor. The isolates had low-level resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (mode minimum inhibitory concentration of cefotaxime, 2 mg/l) but remained sensitive to cephamycins. Cefotaxime was effective in cases of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but failed in major infections at other sites. 1-5 mg/l of the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid or sulbactam restored normal activity to cefotaxime against the multiresistant strains. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was mediated by a new broad-spectrum enzyme of isoelectric point 6.3. Resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides was transferable to Escherichia coli. The emergence of transferable enzymatic resistance to newer beta-lactams in K pneumoniae strains indicates a major risk of spread of such resistance to otherwise sensitive strains.\r"

After DHE there was a mean reduction of 35% in the diameter of the pelvic veins measured and the contrast medium cleared rapidly, with a visible reduction in pelvic congestion. In the other 6 women DHE was given during an acute attack of pelvic pain. The effect of the drug on pain relief was assessed by a single-blind crossover trial with intravenous saline as the placebo and by a visual analogue scale to assess the intensity of pain. Pain was significantly lower post-DHE 4 and 8 h and 2 and 4 days after treatment than after placebo. The results confirm a close association between demonstrable pelvic congestion and pelvic pain.\r"

When blood glucose was maintained at 3.2 mmol/l, reaction time was prolonged in both normal and diabetic subjects and plasma adrenaline levels increased in the normals and some diabetics; there were no other physiological responses. 2 normals and 1 diabetic were aware that their blood glucose was low. When blood glucose was maintained at 2.5 mmol/l for 30 min, 9/10 normals but only 4/15 diabetics recognised hypoglycaemia. Increases in hypoglycaemic symptom score, tremor, and sweating, and falls in diastolic blood pressure were significant only in the normal subjects and the 4 \"aware\" patients. Adrenaline levels increased in all cases, but were more pronounced in the normals and aware diabetics. Reaction time remained prolonged in all groups. All measurements returned to baseline when blood glucose was raised to 4.5 mmol/l. Impairments in adrenaline response may be common, even in diabetic patients without autonomic neuropathy and in those who do not complain of hypoglycaemic unawareness; consequent failure to recognise a falling blood glucose may predispose to a risk of severe hypoglycaemia.\r"

This possibility was investigated by questioning of 176 IDDM patients who had switched from beef/porcine to human insulin with negligible change in dosage 1-48 months earlier. 66 (36%) said that their symptoms of hypoglycaemia had changed from those of sympathoadrenal activation to those of neuroglycopenia. This disadvantage of human insulin is an argument for continued availability of beef/porcine insulin.\r"

Although in the remaining cases the vestibulocochlear cleavage plane is not visible macroscopically, the large-fibered vestibular subdivision and the small-fibered cochlear subdivision are well recognized in histological sections. Within the cochlear subdivision, some fibers of large caliber are mixed with fibers of small caliber in a region we named the \"overlapping zone.\" We studied, histologically, cross sections of the intracranial portion of six eighth nerves at about 5 mm proximal to the porus acusticus. A computerized video system was used to measure the diameters of the fibers of the vestibular and cochlear subdivisions localized at different distances from the vestibulocochlear cleavage plane. The overlapping zone is located within the cochlear subdivision adjacent to the vestibulocochlear cleavage plane. It has a pear-like shape, with the larger part occupying the anterosuperior part of the cochlear subdivision. The mean cross-sectional area of this zone in our six samples is about 0.4 mm2, which is approximately 23% of the area of the cochlear subdivision. The thickness of the zone in the superior-inferior direction ranges from 0.23 mm to 0.55 mm. The parameters of the described overlapping zone should be taken into consideration in vestibular neurectomy, in which complete sectioning of the vestibular fibers is important.\r"

It is used for augmentation of facial defects, carotid artery protection, and repair of oral cavity defects. Additional reconstructive efforts suggest the sternocleidomastoid myocutaneous flap can be used for facial reanimation and as an osteomyocutaneous flap incorporating the clavicle for mandibular reconstruction. Reports of unreliable viability and resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle during neck dissection decreases the applicability of the flap. Twenty-seven sternocleidomastoid flaps were used in 26 patients for head and neck reconstruction. In contrast to the reported 40% to 50% incidence of superficial slough or total flap necrosis, three (11%) flaps developed superficial (cutaneous) slough while two patients developed inclusion cysts. The technique includes elevation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with the overlying platysma and skin originally described by Owens. The procedure is modified by removing the epithelium on the tunneled portion of the flap. This allows the flap to be used as a one-stage method of reconstruction without sacrificing the additional blood supply from the platysma and overlying dermis.\r"

The diagnosis is essentially made by exclusion of various causes of IIP. The classic presenting symptoms of BIH are headache and/or visual disturbances. Otologic manifestations of this syndrome have not been described in detail. In this thesis, 20 BIH patients with associated otologic symptoms were thoroughly studied over a 5-year period. The author concludes that 1. objective pulsatile tinnitus and low frequency hearing loss can be the major or only manifestation of this syndrome; 2. diagnosis is established by lumbar puncture and elimination of other causes of IIP; 3. medical management is very effective with surgery reserved for patients with deteriorating vision or with disabling tinnitus.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the influence of androgens on benign prostatic hyperplasia, using nafarelin acetate, a potent luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone agonist, to achieve reversible androgen deprivation in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Nine patients with bladder-outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia were treated with subcutaneous nafarelin acetate (400 micrograms per day) in an open trial for six months. In all patients, serum testosterone decreased to castrate levels. Objective observations included uroflowmetry, measurement of residual urine volume, determination of prostatic size by ultrasonography, and prostatic biopsy. In all patients, the prostate regressed to a mean (+/- SEM) of 75.8 +/- 3 percent of the initial size (range, 52 to 86; P less than 0.005); the regression reached a plateau after four months. Morphologic analysis of biopsy specimens showed regression of glandular epithelium. Three of nine patients had clinical improvement with treatment. Six months after the cessation of treatment, plasma testosterone levels had returned to normal and the size of the prostate had increased to 99 +/- 5.5 percent of the initial size. These findings suggest that androgens have an important supportive role in established benign prostatic hyperplasia and that testicular suppression will benefit some patients. However, this form of treatment could be applicable only in carefully selected patients who were not surgical candidates, and it would need to be maintained indefinitely.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that inadequate oxygenation of peripheral tissues may be unrecognized in critically ill patients and may worsen their prognosis. To test this hypothesis, we measured oxygen delivery to tissues, oxygen uptake, and the extraction ratio (uptake/delivery) before and during a 30-minute infusion of a vasodilator, prostacyclin (5 ng per kilogram of body weight per minute), in 27 critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. Prostacyclin produced an increase in oxygen delivery (median value before vs. during infusion, 375 vs. 492 ml of oxygen per minute per square meter of body-surface area, P less than 0.001) that was similar in the 14 patients who survived and the 13 who died. This increase in oxygen delivery was associated with a significantly greater increase in oxygen uptake in the patients who died as compared with the survivors (median increase, 19 vs. 5 percent, P less than 0.001). In the survivors, the oxygen extraction ratio fell (median change, -17 percent; range, -27 to -6 percent) and the mixed venous oxygen tension increased. In the patients who died, the extraction ratio rose (median change, 11 percent; range -24 to +40 percent) and the mixed venous oxygen tension did not change. These data suggest the presence of a substantial oxygen debt in patients who subsequently die. Inadequate tissue oxygenation, which may be difficult to recognize, appears to be an important mechanism contributing to the development of irreversible multiple organ failure and subsequent death in some patients with acute respiratory failure.\r"

  ".W": "Cop 1 is a random polymer (molecular weight, 14,000 to 23,000) simulating myelin basic protein. It is synthesized by polymerizing L-alanine, L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, and L-tyrosine. It suppresses but does not induce experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. It is not toxic in animals. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial, we studied 50 patients with the exacerbating-remitting form of multiple sclerosis, who self-injected either 20 mg of Cop 1 dissolved in 1 ml of saline or saline alone daily for two years. Six of 23 patients in the placebo group (26 percent) and 14 of 25 patients in the Cop 1 group (56 percent) had no exacerbations (P = 0.045). There were 62 exacerbations in the placebo group and 16 in the Cop 1 group, yielding two-year averages of 2.7 and 0.6 per patient, respectively. Among patients who were less disabled on entry (Kurtzke disability score, 0 to 2), there were 2.7 exacerbations in the placebo group and 0.3 in the Cop 1 group over two years. Among patients who were more affected (Kurtzke disability score, 3 to 6), there was an average of 2.7 exacerbations in the placebo group and 1.0 in the Cop 1 group. Over two years, less disabled patients taking Cop 1 improved an average of 0.5 Kurtzke units; those taking placebo worsened an average of 1.2 Kurtzke units. More disabled patients worsened by 0.3 (Cop 1 group) and 0.4 (placebo group) unit. Irritation at injection sites and rare, transient vasomotor responses were observed as side effects. These results suggest that Cop 1 may be beneficial in patients with the exacerbating-remitting form of multiple sclerosis, but we emphasize that the study is a preliminary one and our data require confirmation by a more extensive clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "Chemoradiotherapy and transplantation of bone marrow from matched sibling donors have been useful for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients with a poor prognosis but are not available to some two thirds of patients who do not have a matched allogeneic donor. We undertook this study to compare autologous and allogeneic marrow transplantation in the treatment of such cases. We treated 91 patients with high-dose chemoradiotherapy and followed them for 1.4 to 5 years. Forty-six patients with an HLA-matched donor received allogeneic marrow, and 45 patients without a matched donor received their own marrow taken during remission and purged of leukemic cells with use of monoclonal antibodies. Bone marrow engraftment occurred earlier in patients who received autologous marrow. Recipients of autologous marrow had shorter hospital courses, with significantly fewer peritransplantation deaths than recipients of allogeneic marrow. Post-transplantation relapse of leukemia was the most frequent cause of treatment failure; relapses occurred in an estimated 37 percent of patients with allogeneic grafts in whom graft-versus-host disease developed, 75 percent of patients with allogeneic grafts in whom graft-versus-host disease did not develop, and 79 percent of patients who received autologous grafts. The interval before relapse was significantly shorter in the autologous-marrow group than in the allogeneic-marrow group. Recipients of autologous and allogeneic marrow whose first pretransplantation remissions were short (less than 18 months) had eventual outcomes similar to those whose first remissions were longer than 18 months. Patients with a first remission lasting less than 18 months had an outcome better than that expected with chemotherapy alone. The fractions of \"cured\" patients were estimated to be 20 percent in the autologous-marrow group and 27 percent in the allogeneic-marrow group--not a significant difference, but because of the limited statistical power of the study, the question of long-term disease-free survival must still be considered open.\r"

  ".W": "The MHC is of overwhelming importance in determining the fate of an allograft. Over the past 10 years, our understanding of the serology of this locus, its role in cellular immunity, its biochemistry, and most recently, its molecular biology has increased enormously. Genes for all the known loci, both Class I and Class II, have been cloned and sequenced, and their evolution and function are therefore now more amenable to investigation at the molecular level. Concomitantly, an understanding of the different populations of immune cells involved in the recognition of the antigens encoded by these loci has permitted a more precise immunologic description of the rejection response. It is now clear that recognition of both Class I and Class II allogeneic differences by both helper and cytotoxic T cells has an important role in graft rejection. The goal of transplantation biologists is to take advantage of this increased understanding in order to design new techniques for specifically modifying the immune response to MHC antigens and achieving specific tolerance. Some exciting approaches are already being studied, including specific modifications of both the antigen and the receptor arms of the immune response. It is hoped that these approaches will have new clinical applications in the near future.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to contain costs, 27 Medicaid programs have implemented patient-level payment limits for medications, but the effects of these restrictions on quality of care, costs, and health status remain largely unknown. We measured the effect of one state's limit of three paid prescriptions per month and its replacement a year later by a $1 copayment. Using data on 48 months of claims in the study state (New Hampshire) and a comparison state (New Jersey), we employed time-series analysis to evaluate patient-level changes in the number of prescriptions filled for 16 drugs that varied in their clinical importance and cost. Among 10,734 continuously enrolled patients, the limit of three paid prescriptions per month caused a sudden, sustained drop of 30 percent in the number of prescriptions filled (from 1.10 to 0.77 prescriptions per patient per month); no change was observed in the comparison state. The 860 recipients of multiple drugs, who were predominantly female and elderly or disabled, were most severely affected; the number of prescriptions per month dropped from 5.2 to 2.8 (46 percent). The decrease was greatest for \"ineffective drugs\" (58 percent), but large drops were also observed for \"essential\" medications, such as insulin (28 percent), thiazides (28 percent), and furosemide (30 percent). Reductions in Medicaid prescriptions were minimally offset by increases in the size of the prescription or in out-of-pocket payments. When a $1 copayment replaced the three-prescription cap, prescriptions for most medications increased to just below precap levels. Medicaid's savings on drug costs resulting from both policies were comparable ($0.4 to $0.8 million annually), but the copayment policy had less effect on patients receiving multiple drugs. Because the clinical consequences of such policies cannot be assessed from prescription data alone, further study is needed to determine the effects of cost-containment strategies on health status and the use of other services among poor populations.\r"

Data which support the concept of a separate origin for the haematopoietic stem cell and the marrow stroma are derived from cytogenetic or enzyme marker studies of explanted and expanded stromal cells grown under conditions that do not allow haematopoiesis in vitro. Recent evidence in man and in mouse suggesting that the stromal cells capable of transferring the haematopoietic microenvironment in vitro are transplantable seemingly questions this dichotomy, one interpretation being the existence of a common haematopoietic/stromal 'stem cell'. We used in situ hybridization to discriminate donor cells from host in blood and bone marrow samples obtained from patients with functioning sex-mismatched but HLA-identical allografts. Without exception, marrow-derived stromal cells that proliferate in long-term cultures were found to be of host genotype, whereas the macrophage component of the adherent layer in these cultures originated from the donor.\r"

  ".W": "The NOD (non-obese diabetic) mouse spontaneously develops insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) characterized by autoimmune insulitis, involving lymphocytic infiltration around and into the islets followed by pancreatic beta (beta) cell destruction, similar to human IDDM. Genetic analysis in breeding studies between NOD and C57BL/6 mice has demonstrated that two recessive genes on independent chromosomes contribute to the development of insulitis. One of the two recessive diabetogenic genes was found to be linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This is of interest, because the NOD strain has a unique class II MHC: it does not express I-E molecules as no messenger RNA for the alpha-chain of I-E is visible in Northern blot analysis; I-A molecules are not detected with any available monoclonal antibodies or by allo-reactive or autoreactive T-cell clones, although their expression is demonstrated with a conventional antiserum to Ia antigens. To examine whether the unusual expression of class II MHC molecules may be responsible for the development of autoimmune insulitis, we attempted to express I-E molecules in NOD mice selectively, without introducing other genes on chromosome 17 by using I-E-expressing C57BL/6 (B6(E alpha d)) transgenic mice. We report here that the expression of I-E molecules in NOD mice can prevent the development of autoimmune insulitis.\r"

  ".U": "87287211\r", 
  ".W": "Initiation of T-lymphocyte proliferation by mitogen or antigen involves a cascade of gene activation events. Thus, by the time mitogen-activated T cells have reached the G1/S interface, many genes that are transcriptionally silent in G0, like the c-myc, IL-2, IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and transferrin receptor (TfR) genes, have been transcriptionally activated. To understand the role of the individual genes in the activation process, one must be able to interfere specifically with the expression or function of each particular gene product. In this way, by blocking the IL-2R with an antibody, it has been demonstrated that IL-2/IL-2R interaction is required to induce TfR expression in activated T cells. When the function or expression of intracellular proteins is to be blocked, however, the need to introduce antibodies into the cytoplasm of viable cells, although possible, is a limiting factor. We have taken another approach, namely the exogenous addition to bulk cell cultures of small antisense oligomers. Sequence-specific antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides have been reported to inhibit intracellular viral replication without interfering with cellular protein synthesis. Similarly, rabbit globin mRNA translation in a cell-free system and in rabbit reticulocytes has been inhibited by oligomers complementary to the globin mRNA initiation codon region. Recently, a pentadecadeoxyribonucleotide complementary to the initiation codon and four downstream codons of human c-myc mRNA was reported to inhibit the proliferation of the human leukaemic cell line HL-60 specifically. We report here that the same c-myc complementary oligonucleotide inhibits mitogen-induced c-myc protein expression in human T lymphocytes and prevents S phase entry. Interestingly, c-myc antisense treatment did not inhibit G0 to G1 traversal as assessed by morphologic blast transformation, transcriptional activation of the IL-2R and TfR genes, or induction of 3H-uridine incorporation.\r"

  ".W": "Site-directed mutagenesis is a very powerful approach to altering the biological functions of proteins, the structural stability of proteins and the interactions of proteins with other molecules. Several experimental studies in recent years have been directed at estimating the changes in catalytic properties, (rates of binding and catalysis) in site-directed mutants of enzymes compared to the native enzymes. Simulation approaches to the study of complex molecules have also become more powerful, in no small measure owing to the increase in computer power. These simulations have often allowed results of experiments to be rationalized and understood mechanistically. A new approach called the free-energy pertubation method, which uses statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics can often be used for quantitative calculation of free energy differences. We have applied such a technique to calculate the differential free energy of binding and free energy of activation for catalysis of a tripeptide substrate by native subtilisin and a subtilisin mutant (Asn 155----Ala 155). Our studies lead to a calculated difference in free energy of binding which is relatively small, but a calculated change in free energy of catalysis which is substantial. These energies are very close to those determined experimentally (J. A. Wells and D. A. Estell, personal communication), which were not known to us until the simulations were completed. This demonstrates the predictive power and utility of theoretical simulation methods in studies of the effects of site-specific mutagenesis on both enzyme binding and catalysis.\r"

Here we have chemically synthesized 18 peptides corresponding to different fragments of these proteins to immunize Aotus trivirgatus monkeys. Some peptides gave partial protection from challenge with P. falciparum parasites, but none provided complete protection individually. A combination of three partially protective peptides gave complete or almost complete protection, however, suggesting that this particular combination of peptides is a good candidate for a malaria vaccine.\r"

Divalent cations are pivotal in determining this behaviour in that Mg2+ blocks the ion channel in a voltage-dependent manner, and Ca2+ permeates NMDA channels. Zn2+ could also modulate neuronal excitability because it is present at high concentrations in brain, especially the synaptic vesicles of mossy fibers in the hippocampus and is released with neuronal activity. Both proconvulsant and depressant actions of Zn2+ have been reported. We have found that zinc is a potent non-competitive antagonist of NMDA responses on cultured hippocampal neurons. Unlike Mg2+, the effect of Zn2+ is not voltage-sensitive between -40 and +60 mV, suggesting that Zn2+ and Mg2+ act at distinct sites. In addition, we have found that Zn2+ antagonizes responses to the inhibitory transmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). Our results provide evidence for an additional metal-binding site on the NMDA receptor channel, and suggest that Zn2+ may regulate both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.\r"

The 'A' gene, also known as Q2 P'3, ORF-1(4) or sor5, partially overlaps the pol gene; its protein product has a relative molecular mass of 23,000 (Mr 23K) and is present in productively infected cells. The function of this protein is unclear; mutant viruses deleted in 'A' replicate in and kill CD4+ lymphocyte lines, but the high degree of conservation of the deduced amino-acid sequence in nine different HIV isolates (80%) and the presence of analogous genes in HIV-2 and other lentiviruses suggest that the gene function is an important one. Here we describe a mutant virus deficient in the 'A' gene which produces virion particles normally; however, the particles are approximately 1,000 times less infective than wild type. Transcomplementation experiments partially restore infectivity. The mutant virus spreads efficiently when virus-producing cells are co-cultivated with CD4+ lymphocytes, however, indicating that HIV can spread from cell to cell in a mechanism that does not require the 'A' gene product and probably does not require the production of infective virus particles.\r"

Procedures were undertaken after recognition of apparent structural alterations on imaging studies, with objectives being both diagnostic and therapeutic. Target locations were predominantly within the cerebral centrum-basal ganglia (284 cases) and diencephalic-mesencephalic regions (129 cases). Operative objectives included: histological and microbiological assay, cyst and abscess aspiration, installation of temporary or permanent drainage conduits, point source and colloid base brachytherapy, cerebroscopy and ventriculoscopy with biopsy, aspiration, and excision, and intraoperative vascular localization. Using multiple instrumentation at the target point (741 point placements), we realized procedural objectives in 95.6% of the cases.

When the development of implantable stimulators provided an abrupt expansion of techniques in nonstereotactic functional neurosurgery, the field became \"stereotactic and functional neurosurgery.\" The marriage of stereotactic surgery with computed tomography has reawakened the use of stereotactic surgery and brought it closer to general neurosurgery than ever before. Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery as a subspecialty has expanded rapidly and will continue to expand at an unprecedented rate, with significant changes reflecting the continuing advances in technology begun 15 years ago. It is becoming an increasingly important part of the field of neurosurgery and has extended its influence in many new clinical areas previously outside the realm of stereotaxis.\r"

The tumor occupied an extensive intracranial extradural space with a mild orbital infiltration, but little involvement of the leptomeninges and parenchymal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed that the majority expressed pan-T or Leu-1 surface antigens and that the lymphocytes bearing the Leu-3 antigen, or helper phenotype, were predominant compared to the Leu-2 population representing both suppressor and cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, most of the T lymphocytes stained with HLA-DR antigens. Because few B cells were seen, this observation indicates the presence of T cells in an activated state. The literature pertinent to associated organ involvement of metastatic melanomas and the correlations between the tumor and immunological cellular responses are discussed.\r"

Nevertheless, because of the patient's advanced age, the possibilities of metastatic tumor involving the cerebellum or a primary cerebellar lymphoma were considered before operation. Pathological examination of the operative specimen showed a classical medulloblastoma with occasional areas of early neuroblastic differentiation. Immunoperoxidase strains for neurofilaments were of help in confirming the neurogenic origin of the neoplastic cells. Although medulloblastomas in adults are not rare, onset after the age of 50 is exceptional, with only two cases on record in patients 65 or older. The present patient seems to be the oldest individual with a cerebellar medulloblastoma thus far reported.\r"

Most of the eyes revealed complete disappearance of the tumor after 3-5 photocoagulation sessions. Though 4 tumors which did not respond to photocoagulation treatment were located in the central temporal retina within the vascular arcade, no statistically significant difference could be seen between tumor regression and location of the tumor. Complete tumor regression was seen in 4 out of 5 eyes after encircling coagulation alone while 16 out of 19 eyes revealed complete tumor regression after addition of direct treatment of the tumor. Photocoagulation appeared to be a useful tool in the treatment of small choroidal melanomas.\r"

Since that time, the patient has undergone autogenous onlay grafting, which has completely resorbed. Because of continuous resorption, a number of pathologic fractures have occurred. The most recent fracture was treated by means of a freeze-dried rib, which acted as a floor and as a splint to the fracture site. Hydroxylapatite and a marrow mixture were placed on the floor to gain height, strength, and durability. Subsequently, hydroxylapatite augmentation was performed to gain a more anatomic alveolar ridge. The patient's 12-month follow-up has shown the mandible to be intact with no noticeable change in either vertical or horizontal dimensions.\r"

Conversely, ultrastructural studies agree on limited features and give rise to different hypotheses of mesenchymal origin. S-100 immunoperoxidase investigation of one case shows that, unlike those of granular cell tumor (granular cell myoblastoma) granular cells of GGCT do not react positively for S-100 protein, thus suggesting that the GGCT and the granular cell myoblastoma have a different histogenesis.

There were two lesions in the palatine tonsil, one in the nasopharynx, and one in the parotid gland. The average age of the patients was 54.5 years (range, 37 to 70 years), and all patients were men. The histologic types were lymphocyte predominance (one case), nodular-sclerosis (one case), and mixed cellularity (two cases). The patients were respectively staged as IAa, IIAa, and IIIA. They were treated with radiation, chemotherapy, or both. All four patients are now free of tumor and have been followed from 18 months to more than 6 years after definitive diagnosis and appropriate therapy. Immunohistochemistry significantly contributes to the differential diagnosis of atypical Hodgkin's disease from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, especially in extranodal sites. Dako-EMA and Leu-M1 monoclonal antibodies are reactive, respectively, with L and H variants (Dako-EMA+, Leu-M1-) in the lymphocyte predominance type (Type 1) and with Reed-Sternberg cells (Dako-EMA-, Leu-M1+) in the nodular-sclerosis (Type 2), mixed cellularity (Type 3), and lymphocyte depletion (Type 4) types.\r"

  ".W": "Dysesthetic pain following traumatic myelopathy is characterized by diffuse burning and tingling sensations distal to the level of spinal injury. The dysesthetic pain syndrome (DPS) can compromise performance of functional abilities and inhibit participation in rehabilitation programs. Recent laboratory evidence suggests that antidepressant medications with selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake in the brain may be associated with superior analgesic effect compared to such non-selective agents as amitriptyline. Trazodone hydrochloride is a potent presynaptic serotonin reuptake blocker with few anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of trazodone hydrochloride for the treatment of DPS. Following a 2-week placebo lead-in period, patients were randomized to a 6-week course of 150 mg trazodone hydrochloride/day or placebo. Evaluations of pain quality and intensity were performed at 2-week intervals, utilizing the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Sternbach Pain Intensity Scale, and Zung Pain and Distress Index. Neurologic examination and assessment of side effects were performed at each evaluation session. No significant changes were noted in reported pain measures between patients allocated to the active drug group and those given placebo during the course of the protocol. However, significantly more patients randomized to trazodone complained of side effects and prematurely terminated their participation in the study. The results of this investigation are consistent with those of other earlier trials which indicate that such antidepressant medications as trazodone hydrochloride which selectively inhibit presynaptic reuptake of serotonin, may not be effective in the control of certain pain syndromes. These results do not preclude the possible utility of these agents in the treatment of other pain syndromes or at higher doses than previously studied.\r"

  ".W": "When assessing an infant with ambiguous genitalia, there are some important points to remember: Do not delay the evaluation of a patient with ambiguous genitalia. A delay may expose the patient unnecessarily to a life-threatening situation, such as a salt-losing crisis associated with 21-hydroxylase deficiency or one of the testosterone biosynthetic defects. Also, it is unfair to expect the family to be able to deal emotionally with the uncertainty of unresolved gender assignment. Never perform a buccal smear. There is absolutely no indication for performing a buccal smear at any point in the evaluation of any patient with ambiguous genitalia. Use of a buccal smear to determine gender assignment was helpful decades ago, before analysis of human chromosomes was possible. With current cytogenetic methodologies that can detect chromosomal mosaicism and subtle abnormalities of the X and Y chromosomes, there is never an indication to perform a buccal smear. Never make a gender assignment on the basis of the appearance of the external genitalia alone. The chromosomal sex and gonadal sex need to be determined first. The parents' feelings regarding the desired sex of the child, gender identity and fertility need to be discussed. Once there are sufficient data, gender assignment can be made. Gender assignment should be made as soon as possible after birth, but absolutely should be made by 18 months of age, when children develop gender identity. Never equivocate in the assignment of gender. The parents and the physicians must be absolutely certain of the gender assignment and must view their decision as final. Follow-up visits with the family ideally include an assessment of their acceptance of the gender assignment of the child. If there is ambivalence, steps must be taken to identify the source of ambivalence and to clarify the issues.\r"

  ".W": "Cryptorchidism is the most common disorder of sexual differentiation in male children, with an incidence of 3.4 per cent in the term newborn, decreasing to 0.8 per cent at 1 year of age. The mechanisms of normal testicular descent are multifactorial and include an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, as well as a normal gubernaculum and epididymis. In boys with cryptorchidism, the testes demonstrate degenerative changes histologically as early as 1 to 2 years of age. Both testes may be affected, even with a unilateral undescended testis. The most important long-term complications of cryptorchidism include infertility and testicular cancer. The risk of malignancy is approximately 40 times higher in male subjects with cryptorchidism than in normal men, and is highest in male subjects who have had an intra-abdominal testis and in certain intersex conditions. Orchiopexy does not appear to lessen this risk. Hormonal therapy with HCG or LH-RH has remained unproven in clinical trials in the United States; therefore, orchiopexy remains standard treatment. HCG is recommended if the clinician suspects that a testis is retractile, however. Orchiopexy should be performed between 12 and 18 months of age to prevent the degenerative changes that are demonstrable by 2 years.\r"

Constitutional pubertal delay in boys can lead to social and academic problems. Treatment with a short course of testosterone can be beneficial in selected cases.

Goiters appearing during childhood are the result of distinct diseases and should be investigated rather than attributed to \"physiologic hyperplasia.\" The etiology of the diffuse goiter can often be established by clinical evaluation, performing thyroid function tests, and measurement of serum thyroid antibodies. Unlike diffuse goiters, thyroid nodules frequently require tissue examination to exclude malignancy. The goal in evaluating children with nodular goiters is to be as selective as possible in submitting children to surgery without missing cases of cancer. The decision to perform an open biopsy should be based on detecting increased risk for cancer in the medical history, physical examination, or laboratory tests as outlined in Figure 1. Ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration of nodules are two new methods that aid in the selection of patients for surgery or a trial of thyroid hormone suppression.\r"

Hashimoto's thyroiditis probably also includes focal thyroiditis, fibrous thyroiditis, primary myxedema, and Hashitoxicosis as variants. Graves' disease is associated with ophthalmopathy and dermopathy, and recent evidence suggests that these manifestations are autoimmune phenomena as well. Other associated autoimmune disorders include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and antigen-antibody complex nephritis. Nonthyroid endocrine autoimmune deficiency disorders also have been classified as part of the spectrum of thyroid autoimmune disease. With the recent recognition of the spectrum of autoimmune mechanisms and antibody types and methods to distinguish antibody functions or types, our understanding of postpartum and neonatal thyroid disorders has been advanced considerably. The spectrum of neonatal thyroid disorders in the infants of women with autoimmune disease relates to the levels and types of antithyroid antibodies acquired from the mother. Finally, there is suggestive evidence that nonspecific goiter, including simple adolescent goiter and multinodular goiter as well as some cases of sporadic cretinism, may be part of an even more expanded spectrum of autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

One cannot overemphasize the value of obtaining certain diagnostic tests at the presentation of spontaneous hypoglycemia, including blood for insulin, cortisol, growth hormone, and urine for ketone bodies. Supportive treatment with intravenous glucose to maintain the blood glucose greater than 50 mg/dl is important until a diagnosis is established allowing specific therapy aimed at the underlying disorder.\r"

The concept of the \"adiposity rebound\" helps with this decision. The child's family is important and contributes to his or her body adiposity through both nature--an inherited metabolic tendency towards obesity--and nurture--the eating and activity environment and the family functioning. The activity level and energy intake, which although out of balance for the obese child, may not be low or excessive when compared to recommended amounts for children of that age or to that of peers. A child-family pattern can be defined in overweight children based on presence of a metabolic tendency, energy intake, activity level, and family functioning. In looking at the pattern rather than just the child's weight, the clinician can be much more effective with a weight control program, and with proper referral for changing family functioning prior to such a program if necessary.\r"

The selective plates inhibited normal upper respiratory flora but not Strep-A. An incubation time of 18 hours was significantly better than one of 4 hours for the detection of Strep-A antigen in cultures incubated in Todd-Hewitt broth alone or Todd-Hewitt-sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim broth, resulting in a 24% increase in positives. These studies demonstrate that Strep-A detection in throat swab specimens, by either culture or antigen detection, will be influenced by the use of selective antibiotics and incubation time.\r"

An adverse impact of early antibiotic therapy was noted; the incidence of subsequent infections with GABHS was significantly greater in those treated at the initial office visit with penicillin. In the month following documented evaluation of GABHS, a recurrence occurred 2 times more frequently in those treated with penicillin immediately compared with those for whom treatment was delayed 48 to 56 hours. Late recurrences (beyond 1 month but in the same streptococcal season) occurred 8 times more frequently (P less than 0.035). Delay in penicillin treatment did not increase GABHS intrafamilial spread. Symptoms of both groups were assessed for 2 days following the initiation of treatment. Both placebo-treated and penicillin-treated groups used aspirin or acetaminophen ad libitum. Penicillin was shown to reduce fever and relieve sore throat, dysphagia, headache, abdominal pain, lethargy and anorexia significantly beyond that achieved with aspirin or acetaminophen alone.

  ".W": "To evaluate whether the addition of an aminoglycoside might enhance the clinical efficacy of ceftazidime in cystic fibrosis patients with acute exacerbations of chronic Pseudomonas lung infections we carried out a prospective, comparative, randomized blind study with three schedules: ceftazidime vs. ceftazidime plus sisomicin (C/S) vs. piperacillin plus sisomicin, for a total of 60 courses of 14 days of treatment. Each treatment led to clinical and radiologic improvement with marked reduction of signs of acute infection. Statistically there was no significant difference in clinical responses among the schedules. No side effect appeared during treatments with ceftazidime or C/S. Hyperpyrexia was seen in 35% of patients receiving piperacillin. Decrease in Pseudomonas aeruginosa count to less than 10(5) colony-forming units/ml of sputum was achieved in 60% of patients treated with C/S and in 30% of patients who received ceftazidime or piperacillin plus sisomicin (statistically not significant). A transient increase in mean geometric minimal inhibitory concentrations for ceftazidime and piperacillin was observed at the end of the combined therapies. A larger percentage of persistent resistant strains of P. aeruginosa was seen after the combined therapies. We conclude that ceftazidime as monotherapy may be an effective alternative in Pseudomonas lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Its clinical efficacy seems not to be enhanced by the addition of an aminoglycoside, although reduction of Pseudomonas in the sputum was better achieved by the combination of C/S.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective double blind trial compared the fixed combination of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole (E/S) with cefaclor in the treatment of acute otitis media. One hundred nineteen children in six centers across Canada were studied. Diagnostic tympanocentesis of 134 ears yielded 135 bacterial isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (42%); Haemophilus influenzae (21%); Branhamella catarrhalis (10%); Streptococcus pyogenes (5%); and other bacteria (22%). Seventy-seven percent of strains of B. catarrhalis and 14% of strains of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. E/S exhibited greater in vitro activity against H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis. Twenty-three patients had bacteriologically sterile middle ear fluid. The overall clinical outcome at Days 10 and 31 was identical in both treatment groups. Otoscopic findings improved more rapidly in the E/S group than in the cefaclor group at 10 and 31 days (P less than or equal to 0.04). In cases where pre-treatment middle ear fluid was negative on routine bacterial culture, complete cure at 10 days was observed in 75% of patients treated with E/S but only in 14% of those treated with cefaclor (P = 0.02). Side effects were infrequent and comparable between the test drugs. E/S is at least as effective as cefaclor in the management of acute otitis media and may be superior, particularly for cases not yielding bacteria on routine culture.\r"

The first case showed features of a pharyngopalatotonsillar membrane, an exquisitely painful edematous pharynx and larynx and was initially sputum-negative for acid-fast bacilli. This presentation fits the hematogenous form of disease and stresses that: laryngeal tuberculosis is not confined to cases of far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis; tuberculosis should enter the differential diagnosis of pharyngeal, tonsillar and palatal lesions (especially membranoulcerative lesions); and there is a common association between laryngeal and abdominal tuberculosis. Her treatment included a 1-month course of steroids and to date (12 months after onset) she shows no signs of complications. The edematous form of laryngeal tuberculosis may be yet another indication for the use of steroids in tuberculosis. Our second patient presented with prolonged chest symptoms, initial positive sputum for acid-fast bacilli and localized granulomatous laryngeal disease, features of far advanced \"adult\" disease and bronchogenic laryngeal spread. Laryngeal tuberculosis usually responds rapidly to antituberculosis chemotherapy. This was clinically and endoscopically confirmed in both our cases.\r"

  ".W": "Minor head trauma is common among children and evokes strong parental reaction. Parents often rush the child to an emergency department or consult their pediatrician by telephone despite the minor nature of the injury. In a previous report we showed that children with minor head trauma appear to have limitations in their usual daily activities and a high rate of school absenteeism. This study was a prospective, randomized trial of an intervention designed to reduce this functional morbidity after head trauma. Parents in the control group (n = 168) received routine discharge instructions. Parents in the intervention group (n = 153) received a discharge interview during which the nurse gave more explicit and behaviorally oriented instructions. The nurse also called intervention parents the next day to reassure them and to urge that the children return to their usual routine. One month after the injury a questionnaire was administered by telephone to assess physical health status, social or functional limitations, and behavior problems. The majority of parents (85%) were anxious, and this was not alleviated by previous experience with head trauma. Triage nurses incorrectly rated one third of the parents as not anxious. Physical health status, role activity indices, and behavior problems, were similar for the intervention and control groups 1 month after the head injury. Subsequent morbidity was highly correlated with parental anxiety. In managing children with minor head trauma, pediatricians and emergency department physicians must focus their discharge instructions on the parent's anxiety, emphasize the minor severity of the injury, and urge that the children return to their usual routine.\r"

Eighty-three inner city mothers and their healthy, first-born infants were recruited within three days of birth and randomly assigned to either a control or intervention group. All mother-infant pairs were seen by the same pediatric provider for health maintenance visits when the infants were 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months of age. At each visit, anticipatory guidance for all mothers included discussions of such age-appropriate issues as nutrition, safety, sleep, and common problematic behaviors. For the 39 intervention group mothers, the basis for such information was explained through age-specific discussions of affective, cognitive, and physical development. Dependent variables measured after the 6-month visit included maternal-infant interaction; maternal perceptions of infant temperament, family adaptation and adjustment, and satisfaction with the infant's behavior and development; and maternal satisfaction with pediatric services. Analyses of variance demonstrated no significant effect of treatment group on any of the outcome measures. These results do not support the importance of routinely discussing developmental stages during anticipatory guidance and suggest that specific, age-appropriate issues may be discussed without emphasizing the developmental basis for such information.\r"

Twenty-four hours after admission, the methylprednisolone-treated patients demonstrated a greater rate of improvement in their clinical scoring index than did placebo-treated children. However, the duration of hospital stay was not significantly shortened. Twenty-eight of the patients performed serial bedside spirometry at 0, 12, 24, and 36 hours after admission. The methyl-prednisolone-treated patients experienced a more rapid recovery from peripheral airway obstruction as measured by forced expiratory flow rate during 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25-75). The magnitude and rate of improvement in FEF25-75 was significantly greater at 36 hours (P less than .05) and independent of changes in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, or forced expiratory volume in the first second of forced vital capacity. Placebo-treated patients had a higher incidence of asthma relapse within 4 weeks of discharge (eight v two relapses, P less than .05).

  ".W": "Treatment with rimantadine of influenza in children and the potential development of resistance in clinical isolates associated with therapy have not been previously studied. We compared rimantadine to acetaminophen therapy in a controlled, double-blind study of 91 children with influenza-like illness. Of 69 children with proven influenza A/H3N2 infection, 37 received rimantadine and 32 received acetaminophen for five days. Children receiving rimantadine showed significantly greater reduction in fever and improvement in daily scores for symptoms and severity of illness during the first three days. Viral shedding also diminished significantly during the first two days but subsequently increased such that by days 6 and 7 the proportion of children shedding virus, as well as the quantity of virus shed, was significantly greater in the rimantadine group. During the seven-day study, of the 22 children in the rimantadine group with serial isolates tested, ten (45.5%) had resistant isolates compared with two (12.5%) of those with serial isolates in the acetaminophen group (P less than .03). Thus, of the total 37 children in the rimantadine group, 27% were found to have resistant isolated compared with 6% in the total group receiving acetaminophen (P less than .04). Furthermore, the mean inhibitory concentration of rimantadine increased with time in the rimantadine group (r = .4, P = .002) but not in the acetaminophen group. Rimantadine therapy, thus, appears to be significantly more effective than acetaminophen in ameliorating the clinical signs and symptoms of influenza in children. Treatment with rimantadine was also associated with increased viral shedding after the medication was discontinued and with the development of resistance in the clinical isolates, the significance of which is unknown.\r"

This is a result of the increased incidence of chronic illness and a recognition that effective care can significantly retard its progression and interference in the life of the patient. However, because most care in chronic illness is on an ambulatory basis, effective care is directly related to the extent to which patients practice self-care. As a result, the role of the nurse in working with chronically ill patients is less as a provider of treatment and more a facilitator of self-care by the patient. In addition, characteristics of chronic illness and treatment emphasize the complexity of factors and variables that impact on care. The model of self-care in chronic illness has been described to guide nurses in assessing the major issues that influence patients' participation in self-care. Regular assessment of patients' perceptions and circumstances relative to the variables identified by the model will guide nurses in promoting and supporting self-care by chronically ill patients.\r"

  ".W": "The review of reported nursing research on chronic illness has many implications for nursing practice. Results of these studies may be implemented in many of the interventions provided for chronically ill patients. There needs to be collaboration between the researcher and practitioner to share knowledge of interventions that promote adaptation to chronic illness, and to investigate new and innovative therapies. Another contribution to nursing practice is the psychosocial variables that affect adaptation of chronically ill patients. Depending on the health problem and practice setting, nurses need to identify which variable may increase the effectiveness of their interventions and how they can best promote adaptation. Particularly noticeable was the absence of studies on the prevention of chronic illness. Although there is documented evidence of the relationship between stress and illness, and predictions that future environments will be even more stressful, a needed area for nursing research is prevention of chronic health problems. Areas such as stress management, health promotion, relaxation training, and behavior modification are timely subjects for nurses to research for prevention of these problems. There are merits to studying a particular chronic health problem in depth and in studying the commonalities among several chronic illnesses. With knowledge of both the physical and psychosocial, nurses are in an ideal position to contribute to the knowledge base of human responses to chronic illnesses.\r"

It has also resulted in new nonpharmacologic therapies that are now being used more frequently with children. It is hoped that these advances will continue so that health care providers will have a larger repertoire of pain control methods effective with children, and so that the traumatic aspects of hospitalization and health care can be reduced greatly. The pain experienced by children has heretofore been on the backroads of scientific and scholarly development. As a result, we actually know very little about pediatric pain, its measurement, and its treatment. The literature and research cited previously are strikingly limited for providing a base of knowledge to guide clinical practice. We avoided a \"cookbook\" approach to the discussion on pain control, because there are many of those available. Instead, we presented a summary of the research that is currently available in the attempt to help nurses better recognize the limitations in what we know with certainty about this important topic. We hope that this knowledge will spur readers to examine their own beliefs and knowledge, question former assumptions about pediatric pain, and promote a more inquiring approach to assessment and management of children's pain. Pain is a multidisciplinary problem. Although health care providers from the various disciplines each approach the pain problem from different angles, each approach has its place in the overall picture of solving the problems of pediatric pain control. Nurses have been and will continue to be a vital part of clinical and scientific advancements to move pediatric pain out of the realm of mystery and into the realm of the known.\r"

It is the care of human beings--people who should be viewed and treated as a unified whole, people who interact with the environment and those around them on many levels. Nursing as a profession offers a unique service to those who are ill and in pain. That service takes form in many ways, among them a deep caring for the patients. The caring component in nursing is one of the most valuable intangibles, and TT is one of the most basic of the caring skills. TT provides the patient with extra care and puts the \"art\" back in nursing. But TT is also something much more than that. TT is a very personal act of caring, of giving to another person. To the patient with pain, TT affirms that you care and that you are acknowledging their pain. That, in and of itself, can be a source of great comfort to someone with pain. The management of pain is a complex and inexact science at best. The pain experience is a complex and often frustrating one. Patients look to various members of the health care profession for assistance and affirmation of their pain. But there are no \"magic bullets\" in the treatment of pain; even TT is not a universally effective therapy. There is a great deal to learn about pain, about the treatment of pain, and about TT. The challenge now is to continue the research to better understand pain, to understand the human response to pain, and to explain the phenomenon of TT, one modality in the treatment of pain. In implementing this research effort, it is important to recognize that objective scientific information is a necessary but insufficient component in understanding pain. Subjective information, the pain experience, is just as necessary for fully understanding the problem of pain. Until research provides better approaches, the treatment of the patient with pain, regardless of modality, demands multiple approaches, a commitment to keep trying, engaging the patient in the treatment plan, and moving at the patient's pace, not that of the care giver or health care team.\r"

The mutant proteins retain the ability to bind galactosides, and the affinity for several substrates is actually increased. However, the rate of active transport is decreased to 0.01% of the wild-type rate in the mutants carrying Arg-24 or Arg-24, Ser-28. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that the two mutants require 10 min to cause occupied binding sites for galactoside and H+ to change their exposure from the periplasm to the cytoplasm as compared to 50 ms in the wild type. The effect is less pronounced when these sites are unoccupied.\r"

  ".U": "87289642\r", 
  ".W": "The energy requirement for protein breakdown in Escherichia coli has generally been attributed to the ATP-dependence of protease La, the lon gene product. We have partially purified another ATP-dependent protease from lon-cells that lack protease La (as shown by immunoblotting). This enzyme hydrolyzes [3H]methyl-casein to acid-soluble products in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. ATP hydrolysis appears necessary for proteolytic activity. Since this enzyme is inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, it appears to be a serine protease, but it also contains essential thiol residues. We propose to name this enzyme protease Ti. It differs from protease La in nucleotide specificity, inhibitor sensitivity, and subunit composition. On gel filtration, protease Ti has an apparent molecular weight of 370,000. It can be fractionated by phosphocellulose chromatography or by DEAE chromatography into two components with apparent molecular weights of 260,000 and 140,000. When separated, they do not show proteolytic activity. One of these components, by itself, has ATPase activity and is labile in the absence of ATP. The other contains the diisopropyl fluorophosphate-sensitive proteolytic site. These results and the similar findings of Katayama-Fujimura et al. [Katayama-Fujimura, Y., Gottesman, S. & Maurizi, M. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4477-4485] indicate that E. coli contains two ATP-hydrolyzing proteases, which differ in many biochemical features and probably in their physiological roles.\r"

Electron microscopic analysis of the joint molecules indicated they were formed by displacement of one strand of the linear duplex by the single-stranded circular molecule.

As assayed by relaxation of the supercoiled plasmid DNA and by formation of enzyme-linked DNA breaks, the purified enzyme from the resistant cells was shown to be greater than 125-fold as resistant to camptothecin as the wild-type enzyme, comparable to a cellular resistance index of about 300. Therefore, the cellular resistance appears to be due to the resistance of the enzyme. The amount of the immunoreactive enzyme protein in whole extract appeared to be reduced to less than half that of the wild-type enzyme. These results establish that DNA topoisomerase I is the cellular target of camptothecin and that DNA topoisomerase I is essential for the survival of mammalian cells.\r"

We have isolated full-length cDNAs for renin from a rat kidney cDNA library. The cDNAs are complementary to a 1434-nucleotide rat kidney mRNA that encodes preprorenin, the 402-amino acid precursor of renin. This rat cDNA was used to isolate the complete copy of a renin gene from a rat genomic library, and a comparison of this genomic clone with rat genomic DNA showed that renin is a single-copy gene in the rat. Rat renin is 85% identical to one mouse renin isozyme (renin-1) and 81% identical to the second mouse renin isozyme (renin-2), suggesting that the duplication of the mouse renin genes is a more recent event than the speciation of rats and mice. Analyses of rat, human, and mouse renin sequences revealed that the potential to form two-chain renin is apparently peculiar to mouse renin, and the expression of a tenth exon (which results in a three-amino acid insertion) is observed only in the human renin gene.\r"

A phage lambda gt11 cDNA expression library prepared from mRNA from a human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL, was screened using an affinity-purified antibody to the glycocalicin portion of the alpha chain of glycoprotein Ib. Eleven positive clones were isolated and plaque-purified. The largest cDNA insert was 2420 nucleotides in length and coded for a leader sequence of 16 amino acids, a mature protein of 610 amino acids, and a stop codon. It also contained 42 nucleotides of 5' noncoding sequence and 497 nucleotides of 3' noncoding sequence, including a poly(A) tail. The amino acid sequence of the alpha chain of GPIb predicted from the cDNA agreed completely with the sequence of 156 amino acids that was determined by Edman degradation of peptides isolated from human platelet glycocalicin after digestion with trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The extracytoplasmic domain of the alpha subunit of GPIb contains several noteworthy structural features, including a region of seven tandem repeats of 24 amino acids that are homologous with those present in leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein. The extracytoplasmic domain also contains two hydrophilic regions, one rich in charged amino acids and a second rich in serine and threonine residues. The region rich in serine and threonine includes five repeats of nine amino acids as well as the majority of the O-linked carbohydrate sites present in the molecule. The extracytoplasmic domain is followed by a potential transmembrane segment of approximately 29 amino acids and a potential intracellular domain of approximately 100 amino acids located at the carboxyl end of the molecule.\r"

We have measured the effect of several of these chromaffin cell secretory products on cultured bovine adrenal medullary endothelial cells and have found that only ATP stimulates prostacyclin formation. The stimulation of prostacyclin formation by ATP coincides with the metabolism of inositol phospholipids and the accumulation of the putative second messenger inositol trisphosphate. The time course, concentration dependence, and P2-purinergic receptor specificity were similar for ATP-stimulated prostacyclin formation and ATP-stimulated inositol phospholipid metabolism. Thus, the increase in prostacyclin formation may be secondary to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by inositol trisphosphate, leading to activation of phospholipase A2, liberation of arachidonic acid, and the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostacyclin. We propose that the function of ATP, which is often colocalized with cell-specific hormones in secretory cells, may be to regulate blood flow in the adrenal medulla and other endocrine tissues by interacting with adjacent endothelial cells.\r"

Synthesis and glycosylation of glycoprotein gB was observed in COS-1 cells transfected with the vector containing the gB gene. Removal of a 3' fragment of the cloned gene resulted in the synthesis and secretion of a truncated gB glycoprotein. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the expressed glycoprotein was localized in the nuclear envelope as well as in the cell surface. The expressed gB-1 glycoprotein was biologically active and induced fusion of cells to produce polykaryons.

The two catalytic activities reside on distinct functional domains of similar folding, that of an eightfold parallel beta-barrel with alpha-helices on the outside connecting the beta-strands. Both active sites were located with an iodinated substrate analogue and found to be in depressions on the surface of the domains created by the outward-curving loops between the carboxyl termini of the beta-sheet strands and the subsequent alpha-helices. They do not face each other, making \"channeling\" of the substrate between active sites virtually impossible. Despite the structural similarity of the two domains, no significant sequence homology was found when topologically equivalent residues were compared.\r"

The RT4 family is a \"stem-cell-like\" cell line, RT4-AC, that spontaneously undergoes differentiation in culture to three derivative cell types. This process, termed cell-type conversion, results in a segregation among the derivative cell types of parental cell phenotypes that have been described as neuronal-like or glial-like. We have identified a 50-kDa GFAP-immunoreactive cytoskeletal protein and GFAP mRNA in continuous RT4-AC and RT4-D (glial-type derivative) cell lines, but not in two presumptive neuronal-type cell lines. This result suggests that GFAP gene expression is coordinately coupled with the expression of other glial properties during cell-type conversion. In addition, the RT4-AC and RT4-D sublines were found to significantly express GFAP only at high cell densities and not during logarithmic growth and to express GFAP precociously during morphological differentiation following treatment with 1 mM N6, O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. These observations closely reflect reports of glial filament expression in astrocyte cultures, suggesting that a common regulatory mechanism is employed by central and peripheral nervous system glia.\r"

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that in 1:1 cell couples formed between the two cells, in which a specific interaction can be demonstrated, the L3T4 and the TCR become redistributed on the T-cell surface so that they are concentrated in the cell-cell contact region. This coclustering of L3T4 with TCR occurs only when the relevant antigen and appropriate major histocompatibility class II molecules are presented to the T cell, and it therefore requires the specific interaction of the TCR with its complex ligand on the antigen-presenting cell.\r"

The biochemical hallmark of this response is a marked accumulation of the specific astrocyte intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). To date despite its importance, the mechanisms of GFAP gene regulation have not been studied in any developmental or pathological system to our knowledge, and the molecular signals for GFAP mRNA and protein accumulation are not defined. In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a progressive dementing illness caused by an \"unconventional agent,\" we find steadily increasing elevations of GFAP mRNA throughout the later stages of disease, using two independent GFAP cDNA clones, representing the entire insert or the 3'-noncoding region (pScr-1). The accumulation of GFAP, assessed immunocytochemically, follows GFAP mRNA elevation. A 5-fold stimulation of GFAP gene expression precedes the development of florid histologic lesions in the cerebrum, and in the cerebellum 5- to 6-fold increases occurred with no detectable spongiform changes at any time during disease. Therefore, these GFAP changes cannot be simply a response to neuronal damage. These effects are directly or indirectly caused by high local concentrations of agent and possibly involve a humoral factor.\r"

Fifteen patients with colorectal tumors underwent external scintigraphy following the administration of 5.5 mCi (203.5 MBq) In-111 ZCE-025 at doses of 2.5-80.0 mg. Eighteen of 20 documented tumor sites, excluding those in the liver, were detected with In-111 ZCE-025. Lesions less than 1.5 cm could not be detected. Twenty-five percent of liver metastases exhibited positive accumulation of In-111 ZCE-025 at doses of 40-80 mg. No side effects were encountered. Because of the high detection rate of lymph node metastases from colorectal carcinoma with In-111 ZCE-025, this technique may be helpful in preoperative staging of patients with colorectal tumors, as well as in distinguishing recurrent tumors from postoperative or postradiation changes seen on computed tomography scans or other radiologic images.\r"

Of the hepatocellular carcinomas, six were diffusely hyperechoic, two were hypoechoic, two were single hyperechoic lesions, and two were multifocal and hyperechoic. All ten tumors with Doppler shifts of 5 kHz or above proved to be hepatocellular carcinomas. The other two hepatocellular carcinomas showed Doppler shifts of 3 kHz. In contrast, no hemangioma showed shifts above 0.7 kHz, and ten of the 15 gave no detectable signal. Of the metastases, 20 gave no signal and 17 had signals of up to 4 kHz. Three-kilohertz signals were also obtained from a cholangiocarcinoma, a hemangioendothelioma, and focal nodular hyperplasia. Correlation with angiographic findings suggested that the high-velocity Doppler signals were associated with large pressure gradients due to arteriovenous shunting. Duplex Doppler US can therefore aid in the differential diagnosis of diffuse and focal liver lesions.\r"

They did not show active movements, and at their distal end, the small bowel loops could be seen and peristalsis detected. Doppler signals were obtained from the small vascular structures in their center in three additional cases. On the basis of these anatomic findings, pathologic changes such as lymphoma, desmoid tumor, metastatic lesions, dilated vessels, and edema could be detected in 15 patients. When examining with US patients with diseases prone to involve the mesentery, careful attention should be given to this structure, since useful information about the abdominal spread of the disease can be obtained.\r"

The criteria for the diagnosis of recurrence of disease were (a) a single abnormal node with elevated serum markers or positive cytologic aspirate, (b) a single enlarging node on serial studies in the absence of elevated markers, (c) multiple abnormal nodes, or (d) persistently elevated serum markers without abnormal radiologic findings. Thirty-seven patients experienced recurrence, 32 (86%) within the 1st year. Disease recurred most often in the abdomen alone (38%). CT scanning (76%) and marker estimations (68%) enabled detection of recurrent disease more often than chest radiography (22%) or lymphangiographic follow-up (13%).

To oppose such recoil, balloon-expandable metal stents were implanted in artificially stenotic renal arteries in pigs and normal renal arteries in dogs and pigs. The stents were then examined angiographically and histologically at regular intervals. All stents were completely covered with endothelialized neointima in 3 weeks. There was no difference in intimal thickness between the stenotic and nonstenotic renal arteries. A large stent diameter and a large open or nonmetal surface may cause less intimal hyperplasia, but nonturbulent, fast arterial flow is probably the most important factor in ensuring long-term patency of the vessel.\r"

  ".W": "A new type of endovascular prosthesis was inserted in 28 animals and evaluated for several factors, including thrombogenicity, tendency to migrate, critical implant zones, and incorporation into the vascular wall. The new prosthesis is a woven, multifilament structure of stainless steel alloy; its inherent elastic, self-expanding characteristics hold it against the vessel walls. Forty-seven endoprostheses (3-5 mm in diameter, 15-50 mm long) were percutaneously implanted with either a 6-F introducer sheath, a coaxial 9-F catheter, or a 0.014-inch (0.036-cm) guide wire into the femoropopliteal, coronary, carotid, and renal arteries and iliac veins. Anticoagulant or platelet antiaggregating agents were not used before or after implantation. Angiographic and histologic analyses showed that the prosthesis had a very low thrombogenicity when it was well adapted to the native vessel diameter and that it was incorporated into the vessel wall by a new intima by the 3d week after implantation. No migration occurred, and branch vessel flow was preserved even in those vessels in which ostia were traversed by the prosthesis. This prosthesis has potential for clinical application in the treatment of postangioplasty restenoses, particularly in the coronary arteries.\r"

The hearts were then subjected to reperfusion for a period of 45 min for those sustaining 2 hours of ischaemia and 60 min for those sustaining 3.5 hours of ischaemia. In the hearts that suffered 2 hours of ischaemia there were no differences in myocardial content of high energy phosphate compounds between the pretreated and controls, and there was no evidence of creatine kinase release. In the hearts exposed to 3.5 hours ischaemia, myocardial content of high energy phosphates was significantly higher in the pretreated than in the controls. The release of creatine kinase was also less, but this difference was not significant. The study indicates that preoperative treatment with glucose-insulin-potassium may improve myocardial tolerance to ischaemia.\r"

High-frequency positive-pressure ventilation was used in four of the five cases and greatly facilitated the operation. Recovery was uneventful. Adenoid cystic carcinoma was too extensive for extirpation in one case, but 4 months after radiotherapy a 7 cm tracheal segment with residual tumour was removed; 3 years later the patient is well. There was no stenosis or other late complication and no local recurrence in the long-term survivors. No vocal paralysis occurred. The two patients with laryngeal release had remarkably little and transitory dysphagia. Technical problems are discussed and conclusions are presented.\r"

The initial step was the establishment of an adequate science base for the developing enterprise. Given this, it was agreed that the nation's medical establishment could use the evolving support system effectively. What follows is a brief consideration of some events contributing to the reduction of a possibility to reality. Much of the material that follows was derived from a presentation to a presidential commission established by President Gerald Ford in 1975 and later published as a supplement to the Journal of Medical Education. The latter encompassed what happened during the critical years of development. But it seemed too recent at that time to discuss with grace the \"how\" of program changes. It is the \"how of things\" that will be treated in this article.\r"

During discussions of our plans for a year-long centennial observance with members of our House and Senate appropriations subcommittees, congressional members urged us to set two specific objectives: making NIH better known to the American people, and presenting the attractions of the many roles in health-related research to young people who have not yet formulated career plans. When I was invited to prepare an article for Science dealing with my personal experiences as director of NIH since April 1982, it seemed an opportunity to address the same objectives for the scientific community, for in my view there is much misinformation and far too much pessimism throughout the country about the state of biomedical research and its support.\r"

  ".U": "87292116\r", 
  ".W": "Gene expression is dependent on the interaction of DNA binding factors with distinct promoter control elements to activate RNA synthesis. The expression of the HIS4 gene in yeast is under two different control systems. One of these, general amino acid control, involves a DNA binding protein, GCN4, that stimulates transcription in response to amino acid starvation by binding to 5'-TGACTC-3' sequences in the HIS4 promoter region. A second system, the basal level control, stimulates HIS4 transcription in the absence of amino acid starvation. The basal level transcription of the HIS4 gene is under the control of two genes, BAS1 and BAS2, which are also required for the control of purine biosynthesis. In addition, BAS2 is required for the utilization of organic phosphates in the growth medium. Genetic mapping and DNA sequence analysis show that BAS2 is PHO2, a gene previously identified as a regulator of phosphate metabolism. Direct biochemical analysis shows that the BAS2 gene encodes a protein that binds to both the HIS4 and PHO5 promoters. The involvement of a single DNA binding protein in the regulation of histidine, adenine, and phosphate metabolism suggests that yeast may use a few key DNA binding proteins to coordinate the regulation of diverse metabolic pathways.\r"

A major metabolic abnormality of non-insulin-dependent diabetes is impaired insulin action (insulin resistance). Diets high in fat from vegetable and nonaquatic animal sources (rich in linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, and saturated fats) lead to insulin resistance. In rats fed high-fat diets, replacement of only 6 percent of the linoleic omega-6 fatty acids from safflower oil with long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil prevented the development of insulin resistance. The effect was most pronounced in the liver and skeletal muscle, which have important roles in glucose supply and demand. The results may be important for therapy or prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the aspartic acid residue in the serine protease catalytic triad Asp, His, and Ser has been tested by replacing Asp102 of trypsin with Asn by site-directed mutagenesis. The naturally occurring and mutant enzymes were produced in a heterologous expression system, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. At neutral pH the mutant enzyme activity with an ester substrate and with the Ser195-specific reagent diisopropylfluorophosphate is approximately 10(4) times less than that of the unmodified enzyme. In contrast to the dramatic loss in reactivity of Ser195, the mutant trypsin reacts with the His57-specific reagent, tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone, only five times less efficiently than the unmodified enzyme. Thus, the ability of His57 to react with this affinity label is not severely compromised. The catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme increases with increasing pH so that at pH 10.2 the kcat is 6 percent that of trypsin. Kinetic analysis of this novel activity suggests this is due in part to participation of either a titratable base or of hydroxide ion in the catalytic mechanism. By demonstrating the importance of the aspartate residue in catalysis, especially at physiological pH, these experiments provide a rationalization for the evolutionary conservation of the catalytic triad.\r"

To investigate the consequences of grafting adrenal medullary tissue into the brain of a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, a piece of adult mouse adrenal medulla was grafted unilaterally into mouse striatum 1 week after MPTP treatment. This MPTP treatment resulted in the virtual disappearance of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers and severely depleted striatal dopamine levels. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after grafting, dense tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the grafted striatum, while only sparse fibers were seen in the contralateral striatum. In all cases, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers appeared to be from the host rather than from the grafts, which survived poorly. These observations suggest that, in mice, adrenal medullary grafts exert a neurotrophic action in the host brain to enhance recovery of dopaminergic neurons. This effect may be relevant to the symptomatic recovery in Parkinson's disease patients who have received adrenal medullary grafts.\r"

The mechanism by which the protein induces these cellular effects is poorly understood, but might be linked to its ability to regulate RNA transcription from a number of viral and cellular genes. The mechanism of E1A's transcriptional-activation (trans-activation) was studied here by monitoring the protein's effect on specific adenovirus promoters in two types of transcriptional systems in vitro. One of these systems consisted of extracts from transformed cells constitutively expressing E1A, and the other consisted of extracts of HeLa cells supplemented with a plasmid-encoded E1A protein purified from Escherichia coli. The results show that the E1A protein specifically stimulates transcription from adenovirus promoters; thus, the induction of cellular transcription factors is not necessary to explain the stimulation of transcription by E1A.\r"

  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects virtually everyone by adulthood, and a lifelong latency is maintained. It infects children silently, whereas the majority of adolescents have infectious mononucleosis (IM). Children who have IM before 5 years of age are often heterophil negative; EBV-specific antibodies are required for diagnosis. On rare occasions the symptoms of IM may persist in a chronic or recurrent form, and fatal infectious mononucleosis occurs rarely. Depending on the type and degree of immune deficiency and the time the EBV infection occurs in the life cycle, various atypical outcomes can occur. Children with primary immune deficiency can have fatal or chronic IM, malignant B cell lymphoma, virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, aplastic anemia, or acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. The various outcomes of the EBV infections are likely governed by the immune response of the individual. The increased frequency of B cell neoplasms in immunodeficient patients is likely due, in part, to EBV. Individuals with acquired immune deficiency disorders such as AIDS or allograft recipients may develop malignant B cell lymphomas which tend to be polyclonal, but which may progress through stages of oligoclonality to monoclonality. This conversion likely results from specific reciprocal chromosomal translocations such as t(8;14), which is seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. Detection of EBV in immunodeficient patients is achieved by EBV-specific antibody studies or isolation of virus by obtaining spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines from peripheral blood, isolating virus from throat washings, or identifying EBV genome by molecular hybridization techniques. Prevention of primary immune deficiency by early detection and genetic counseling and monitoring of patients for occurrence of EBV infection may lead to early treatment. Acyclovir and immunoglobulin therapy can be of value in some patients with active EBV infection.\r"

A WBC less than or equal to 5,000/cu mm or a ratio of immature to total neutrophils greater than or equal to 20% correlated significantly with bacteremia or bacterial meningitis, though the sensitivities of these tests were unacceptably low. Prospectively, of 61 infants whose clinical appearance did not suggest sepsis, none had bacterial pathogens in the blood or CSF, whereas four of 36 infants with a septic appearance did have pathogens. Recent investigations support the initial clinical impression as important in assessing these febrile infants.

It is 96% accurate in detecting the presence of gallstones and carries a sensitivity of .97. Both studies are prone to overinterpretation, which skews specificity and adversely affects diagnostic accuracy. In this retrospective review of 234 consecutive cases of cholecystectomy, real-time ultrasound was 90% accurate with a sensitivity of .96 in determining the presence of cholecystolithiasis.

The actual case fatality rate approaches 100%. AIDS affects all groups and classes of people, although some are at special risk. Distribution of the disease is worldwide. The illness' effects on the body are widespread; of special interest are the ophthalmologic manifestations. The eye may be infected by various viruses (cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus or HIV itself), toxoplasma gondii, candida sp, cryptococcus neoformans, M. tuberculosis, or M. avium-intracellulare. Kaposi's sarcoma may affect the eye as well. Retinal vascular abnormalities (e.g., cotton-wool spots, vasculitis) are not uncommon in AIDS. The syndrome may present with neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations. No effective treatment for the illness is currently available, although several hold promise and there is hope for an AIDS vaccine.

Only MG-25 and MG-62 produced a significant elevation of plasma glucose concentrations. Release of gastrin was not affected by either the presence of bile or the glucose content of the meal. We conclude that endogenous bile enhances nutrient-stimulated release of insulin, this effect is glucose-dependent with a threshold of approximately 1 gm/kg of glucose, and bile may facilitate the release of insulinotropic hormones other than gastrin.\r"

  ".W": "Both complement (C) and neutrophils (PMN) are activated in critically ill patients. To evaluate the role of endotoxin in this response, we studied C activation products and PMN cell surface receptors in seven normal subjects before and after endotoxin (USRef 20 U/kg) or saline solution administered on separate occasions. By 4 hours, with endotoxin only, all subjects had myalgia, headache, an increase in body temperature and heart rate, and leukocytosis that returned to normal by 24 hours. At the same time, PMN cell surface receptors for the complement opsonin C3b increased, as measured by indirect immunofluorescence, rising to 251 +/- 44% of baseline by 4 hours (p less than 0.01) and remaining elevated at 24 hours (237 +/- 16%, p less than 0.01). PMN receptors for iC3b increased to 308 +/- 49% of baseline by 4 hours (p less than 0.02) and returned to normal by 24 hours. There was no change in plasma of C3a desArg, C4a desArg, and C5a desArg (4 hours: mean C3a: 153.4 +/- 11.5 ng/ml versus 176.2 +/- 16.2 ng/ml for saline solution, p = ns; C4a: 159.6 +/- 32 ng/ml versus 151.4 +/- 21 ng/ml, p = ns; C5a: undetectable). To confirm the lack of C activation, we examined PMN chemotaxis (CTX) to C5a for any impairment caused by prior in vivo exposure to C5a. CTX to C5a was unaffected (4 hours: 109% +/- 22% of normal versus 114% +/- 10% for saline solution, p = ns). PMN CTX to formyl-methionyl-leucine-phenylalanine and PMN phagocytosis and killing of S. aureus were also unaffected by endotoxin. Thus, a single dose of endotoxin produced a subjective febrile illness and precipitated sustained PMN activation as indicated by increased PMN cell surface complement receptor number in the absence of C activation.\r"

All animals were challenged with 1 X 10(8) Escherichia coli intraperitoneally. Long-term survival was significantly enhanced in the combined therapy group (56%, p less than 0.05) when compared with D5W (0%), gentamicin alone (0%), or glucan alone (9%). Macrophage secretory activity, as assayed by interleukin-1 (IL-1) production, was significantly enhanced by combined therapy when compared with the other three treatment groups. Combined therapy significantly reduced E. coli bacteremia at 8 hours after inoculation, when compared with the other three groups. Availability of host neutrophils was assessed by peripheral counts and bone marrow proliferation assay. Combined glucan-gentamicin significantly enhanced bone marrow proliferation when compared with the other three groups and this enhancement correlated with increased circulating neutrophils. Combined immunomodulator and antibiotic therapy had synergistic effects on survival in E. coli peritonitis. This combined therapy enhanced macrophage secretory activity and bone marrow proliferation. Clinical use of immunomodulators may alter conventional use and dosage of antibiotics.\r"

Therapy with vasodilators has been generally unsuccessful, but replacement of high-energy phosphometabolites through the use of ATP-MgCl2 and fructose 1,6-diphosphate has been effective. Recently we reported that phosphocreatine is the major high-energy phosphometabolite in mammalian skin and that ATP levels and cellular well-being in skin flaps are dependent on adequate supply of this phosphometabolite. We report herein the successful augmentation of survival of ischemically compromised skin flaps through postoperative phosphocreatine infusion. This metabolite effectively circumvents the nonfunctioning mitochondrial creatine-phosphocreatine energy shuttle without disturbing the delicate [ATP]/[ADP] balance in the cytosol. In addition, phosphocreatine may favorably redistribute blood flow from muscle to the ischemically compromised skin.\r"

Injuries were assigned to the three categories on the basis of bronchoscopic findings and clinical history. Eleven patients had simultaneously sustained a common smoke-inhalation injury without burns while trapped in a burning ship; twelve patients had massive cutaneous burns over 50% of the total body surface area (TBSA); and seventeen patients had cutaneous burns over more than 30% of the TBSA and inhalation injury. Colloid oncotic pressure was maintained with salt-poor albumin infusion. Central venous pressure, arterial saturation, inspired oxygen, arterial pressure, and urine output were continuously monitored. Extravascular lung water (EVLW) and cardiac output were measured by the double indicator (thermal dye dilution) technique. EVLW remained normal throughout the study period in the group of patients with burns alone. In the first 24 hours after injury, EVLW increased in both groups with smoke injury and remained elevated for more than 48 hours after injury in patients with smoke injury only. The group with both smoke-inhalation and burn injuries showed an early increase in EVLW, which returned to normal by 28 hours after injury and which remained normal until 5 days after injury. The EVLW level then increased again until the end of the study period. In this study, lung edema formation is attributed to the toxic effect of smoke inhalation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine the significance of graft lumen exposure to blood-borne organisms in the development of graft infection. Three groups of dogs were studied. In group I (n = 20), the infrarenal aorta was dissected from surrounding tissue, divided, and reconstructed with a Dacron tube interposition graft. In group II (n = 9) the aorta was similarly isolated, but Dacron graft material was wrapped around the intact aorta. In group III (n = 13) the infrarenal aorta was isolated, but no graft material was placed. All dogs were given intravenous 1 X 10(7) Staphylococcus aureus at the completion of surgery. Group I grafts were harvested 8 hours, 1 day, or 21 days after bacterial challenge. Group II and III grafts were harvested 1 day or 21 days after infusion. At the time of harvest, selective cultures of the periaortic tissue (PAT), periaortic graft (PAG), and interposition graft lumen (GL) were taken. The overall infection rates were similar, with 17 of 20 (85%) dogs in group I, 6 of 9 (67%) in group II, and 11 of 13 (85%) in group III found to be culture positive. In group I, 3 of 3 dogs at 8 hours, 2 of 2 on day 1, and 12 of 15 on day 21 had positive PAT cultures. Only 4 of 15 on day 21 had positive GL cultures. In group II, 4 of 5 dogs on day 1 and 2 of 4 on day 21 had positive PAT and PAG cultures. In group III, 9 of 9 animals on day 1 and 2 of 4 on day 21 had positive PAT cultures. All aortic lumen cultures were negative in groups II and III. The difference between GL and PAT cultures was statistically significant in all groups (I, p = 0.01; II, p = 0.05; III, p = 0.01). Serial quantitative blood cultures revealed a mean bacterial load of 10.5 +/- 4.5 CFU/ml at 15 minutes postinfusion, which fell steadily until no bacteria were detected at 3.5 hours. Lymphangiography demonstrated periaortic pooling of lymph in the immediate postoperative period. These data suggest that the bacteremia in this model is transient and rapidly clears. Periaortic tissues quickly sequester bacteria, possibly because of lymphatic leakage. The GL appears to be secondarily infected.\r"

Of the 838 participants, 396 (196 control and 200 surgical patients) have complete 5-year lipoprotein results and are the basis of this report. After PIB, total cholesterol level decreased 24 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- SEM) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level fell 38 +/- 1.5% in comparison with control subjects. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level was not changed by PIB; however, a significant decrease in HDL occurred over 5 years in the control group (41.7 +/- 0.7 mg/dl versus 39.5 +/- 0.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.05). This led to consistently higher HDL levels in the surgical group in comparison with control subjects after PIB. Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in the surgery group than in control subjects (24 +/- 7.6% and 21 +/- 5.4% at 5 years). Apolipoprotein B-100 was significantly lower, and apolipoprotein A-I and HDL-2 were significantly higher in the surgery group. These lipoprotein changes are greater than have been reported from any previous trial of dietary or pharmacologic intervention, including the Lipid Research Clinics-Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, which used cholestyramine. Based on available epidemiologic data, these changes predict a marked reduction in morbidity and mortality rates associated with coronary heart disease after PIB.\r"

In an attempt to identify the mechanisms by which the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus resists normal host defences the effect of spores and spore diffusates of A fumigatus on the production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by primed rodent phagocytic cells has been measured. For comparison we have used the non-pathogenic fungus Penicillium ochrochloron. Production of these reactive oxygen intermediates in response to A fumigatus was significantly lower than that in response to P ochrochloron. A similar reduction was achieved by diffusate prepared from freshly washed spores. The inhibitory component was of low molecular weight (less than 14,000) and its effect was dose dependent. These results suggest that spores of A fumigatus fail to trigger and also inhibit the production of reactive oxygen intermediates by phagocytic cells.\r"

They were randomly allocated to receive 400 mg daily or placebo orally in a double blind fashion. In the treated group (n = 6), concentrations of serum IgG specific for Aspergillus fumigatus fell significantly during treatment (mean reduction 42% (SEM 2.2%) compared with determinations preceding the study). This effect was evident by three months and continued for the 12 months of treatment. Patients receiving placebo (n = 4) showed no significant change in serum IgG concentration (mean change + 10% (SEM 5.3%]. Asthmatic patients treated with ketoconazole (n = 4) had significantly lower symptom scores than those receiving placebo (n = 3) (+0.45%/month (SEM 6.9%) versus +27%/month (SEM 6.5%); p less than 0.001). None of the patients treated with ketoconazole reported any adverse effects. Ketoconazole may cause serious liver damage but its use may be justified in bronchopulmonary aspergillosis if further experience confirms its ability to alter the course of a potentially serious disease.\r"

Betamethasone (8 mg) and prednisolone (40 mg) were administered daily for 10 days with a washout period of 10 days between. In this first part of the study betamethasone was administered intramuscularly and prednisolone orally. Placebo injections and tablets were used. Mean FEV1 was not significantly different before each period. There was a significant increase in FEV1 while they were taking betamethasone but not prednisolone. Individual analysis of the data showed that FEV1 increased with betamethasone in nine patients and remained stable or decreased in three. During treatment with prednisolone baseline FEV1 increased moderately in three patients (FEV1 0.3, 0.5 and 0.6 l) and remained stable or decreased in nine. There was no significant difference between the bronchodilator responses to cumulative doses of inhaled salbutamol when they were measured immediately before, on the last day of treatment with each steroid, and between steroid treatment periods. The same protocol was followed four months later in five of the 12 patients but both drugs were administered orally on this occasion. Similar results were obtained. The greater effect of betamethasone on bronchial obstruction may be due to its longer biological half life or to some unidentified property of its metabolites. The bronchial response to inhaled beta 2 agonist appears not to be influenced by either steroid in these patients.\r"

Six subjects with mild asthma (FEV1 81% of predicted) were studied on three occasions. On each visit they received one of three aerosols tagged with technetium-99m in 0.9% saline. The aerosols were generated by either (A) a Turret nebuliser operated at 8 l min-1 (mass median diameter (MMD) 1.8 micron); (B) an Upmist nebuliser operated at 6 l min-1 (MMD 4.6 microns); or (C) an Inspiron Mini-neb operated at 4 l min-1 (MMD 10.3 microns). The aerosols were given in a randomised single blind manner and inhaled under identical conditions of inspiratory volume and frequency. The mean (SD) percentage of aerosols A, B, C released from the nebulisers during inhalation that was recovered in an expiratory filter was 23 (6), 25 (4), and 24 (4) respectively. Of the aerosols released from the nebuliser and deposited in the body, the percentage deposited in the lung was 79 (3) for aerosol A, 59 (4) for aerosol B, and 44 (5) for aerosol C. The remaining aerosol was deposited in the oropharynx and swallowed. It is concluded that small nebulised aerosols (MMD less than 2 microns) deliver a larger dose to the lungs and should be used to maximise lung deposition.\r"

A study was carried out on the effect of sputum sol (obtained by rapid centrifugation of purulent sputum) from 20 patients with chronic bronchial sepsis on the beating of human nasal cilia in vitro by a photometric technique. Thirteen sols caused significant (p less than 0.001) ciliary slowing. Two patterns of slowing were observed: firstly, a gradual onset associated with epithelial disruption (inhibited by alpha 1 antiprotease) and, secondly, an immediate onset associated with ciliary dyskinesia and ciliostasis (inhibited by chloroform extraction). The ciliary slowing activity of sputum sols was associated with the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that purulent sputum contains at least two factors that impair ciliary beating--one a serine protease, which is probably a product released by the host's phagocytic defences, and the other, which is chloroform extractable and probably a bacterial product.\r"

Cryoanalgesia of the intercostal nerves has been advocated as an effective means of local analgesia without serious side effects. A prospective randomised blind trial to investigate the efficacy of the technique was carried out. A total of 53 patients undergoing thoracotomy were allocated to either the trial or a control group. At thoracotomy the surgeon was informed of the patient's trial allocation. The trial group received one minute of direct cryotherapy to at least five intercostal nerves related to the incision. All patients received methadone via the lumbar epidural route in a dose calculated according to their weight. A linear analogue assessment of postoperative pain was made by the patients as soon as they were sufficiently awake. An independent record of all postoperative analgesia was kept. After discharge from hospital further assessments were made at least six weeks after operation. Statistical analysis of the scores of postoperative pain and analgesic consumption showed that there was no significant difference between the trial and the control group. There was, however, a suggestion of an increase in the long term morbidity, although these figures were not amenable to statistical analysis. Thus is has not been possible to demonstrate a role for cryoanalgesia in the control of post thoracotomy pain.\r"

Evaluation of the patient and appropriate patient selection for transplantation will become increasingly important issues as more and more children come to transplantation and compete for available organs. Numerous complications occur after transplantation, including infections. We have summarized our experience with bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in these patients and emphasize the need for continued improvement in immune suppressive drugs and regimens to minimize such complications. And finally, information presented on 65 pediatric patients followed 2 to 5 years suggests that, despite numerous complications and often prolonged hospitalization for transplantation, life-style after transplantation appears to be significantly improved.\r"

The use of CyA together with combined kidney and whole pancreas transplants has significantly improved the graft survival in our program. It is difficult to draw conclusions as to the best technique for ductal management with the limited number of patients in each group. However, in our experience, ductocystostomy and pancreaticoduodenocystostomy have so far yielded the best results. Pancreaticocutaneous fistula with delayed ductal occlusion yielded the worst results and is not recommended. The effect of pancreas transplantation on the secondary complications may not be well discerned at this point in time until more long-term survivors are obtained. Some of our current results reflect the acceptance of high-risk transplant candidates into our program as well as the search for an improved pancreatic drainage technique.\r"

With the use of pancreaticocystostomy, overall mortality could be decreased to a level similar to the results reported for kidney transplantation in diabetic patients. Particularly encouraging are the results obtained in combined kidney and pancreas transplantation, with current actuarial graft survival rates for kidneys of 95% and pancreatic grafts of 85%. Overall, the quality of life for patients receiving a pancreatic transplant has been good, and in cases where no postoperative complications were encountered, a tremendous feeling of well-being from a physiological and psychological standpoint was achieved. It is our conclusion that pancreatic transplantation should be pursued as a viable form of therapy in selected patients and centers with large experience in the transplantation of diabetic patients.\r"
