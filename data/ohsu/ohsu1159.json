This approach focuses on the physical, psychological, and spiritual needs of the patient and family. We describe our experience with 131 patients managed by the supportive care team that resulted in humane care of dying patients and reduced hospital costs as evidenced by reduced Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System values. Although our goal is comprehensive terminal care, financial savings have resulted as well. We describe the elements of care that contribute to compassionate management and to reduced interventions and costs. This approach may have application in other critical care settings that are faced with the same challenges of providing humane care to hopelessly ill patients.\r"

The traditionally used methods for evaluating ventilation, such as physical examination and measurement of vital signs, are indirect. The most commonly used direct method, measurement of arterial carbon dioxide tension, is invasive and intermittent. Capnography provides the critical care practitioner with a continuous, noninvasive, and accurate assessment of ventilation. To interpret capnographic data, the practitioner must have a clear understanding of normal and abnormal patterns of carbon dioxide elimination in the lung. We review relevant respiratory physiology as a basis for understanding the value of capnography. The technology on which capnography is based is described with emphasis on methods of gas sampling, limitations of capnography, and features available on currently marketed instruments. Representative capnograms are presented and the data interpreted to enable the practitioner to determine when capnography is an appropriate monitor for the critically ill adult.\r"

This laboratory study was conducted to determine whether the addition of PHM (Metamucil) to enteral feeding formula (Entrition) adversely affected the flow characteristics of the feeding formula through a small-bore feeding tube. Descriptive data were obtained from 72 trials of feeding formula with varied infusion rates, formula osmolality and temperature, and PHM concentrations. Two thirds (n = 48) of the trials were successful (PHM did not clog the tubing and obstruct flow). The remaining one third of the trials (n = 24) were unsuccessful. Successful formula infusion was influenced by formula temperature and osmolality but not by infusion rate, PHM concentration, or flow interruption. If formula with PHM was followed by formula without PHM, the infusion was successful regardless of infusion rate or formula osmolality. Thus, the data from this laboratory study indicate that when therapeutic doses of PHM are prescribed, it is feasible for PHM to be mixed in room-temperature feeding formula and infused without clogging the feeding tube.\r"

Forty-nine patients in a large medical center were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental group. During the 6-day study period 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of psyllium preparation was administered through the feeding tube three times a day. Data were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data. The hypothesis that giving a bulk-forming cathartic would lead to firmer stools was supported at an alpha level of less than 0.01. The results of this study suggest that use of a bulk-forming cathartic in tube-fed patients will significantly reduce the diarrhea associated with this type of feeding.\r"

The over-all rate of occurrence of heterotopic ossification was 72 per cent. Of the fifty-eight patients who had received aspirin throughout their course in the hospital, two (3 per cent) had severe ectopic ossification (grade III or IV8). In contrast, twelve (48 per cent) of the twenty-five patients who had received no aspirin or in whom aspirin had been discontinued so that anticoagulation could be begun had severe heterotopic ossification. The difference in the severity of the ossification between the two groups is significant (p less than 0.0001).\r"

The average amount of blood collected in our series was 493 ml, most of which was collected in the first four postoperative hours. In patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty, there was a 54% reduction in banked blood utilisation. None of our patients developed adverse effects from the reinfused material. The cost of collecting and processing wound drainage using the Haemolite cell washer was $175 per patient, regardless of the volume processed, compared to $125 for a unit of banked blood. By reducing the requirement for homologous transfusion, blood salvage diminishes the risks of transmission of HIV and hepatitis viruses. In those cases where the equivalent of two units of blood are reinfused, blood salvage saves money. However, due to the small amounts of blood collected in unilateral hip or knee arthroplasty, we do not recommend its routine application in these cases.\r"

The imaging studies suggest that the cartilaginous proximal femoral epiphysis is hypoplastic, with delayed appearance of single or multiple ossification centres. Progressive improvement occurred and at an average age of five years and six months, there was complete fusion of all the ossific nuclei and normal density and texture of the epiphyseal bone. The end result was a round epiphysis with a slightly diminished height. The dysplasia is attributed to focal hypoplasia of the proximal femoral epiphysis.\r"

In recent years low-sedating H1 antihistamines with reduced sedative and anticholinergic side effects have become popular choices for the treatment of urticaria and angioedema. Terfenadine and astemizole are currently available in the United States, and cetirizine and loratadine, currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, are available in other countries. Terfenadine, cetirizine, and loratadine achieve rapid peak plasma concentrations in 1 to 2 hours, whereas astemizole has a slow onset of action. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of chronic idiopathic urticaria, low-sedating H1 antihistamines were more effective than placebo. The choice of a particular low-sedating H1 antihistamine depends on pharmacokinetic considerations and frequency of administration.\r"

In the first portion of the study, the concentration of Sandoglobulin was increased from 6% to 12%. In the second portion, the flow rate was increased to 5 mg/kg/min, and if no reactions occurred, the time of each successive infusion was decreased by 10 minutes until infusions were completed in 15 to 20 minutes or vasomotor reactions occurred. Thirteen of the 16 patients completed the study; six patients achieved reaction-free rates greater than 15 mg/kg/min, and the other patients achieved rates ranging from 7.1 to 12 mg/kg/min. Seven patients had infusion times less than 30 minutes, with four patients completing infusions in 15 minutes. In the 13 patients who completed the study, there were 14 reactions in 159 infusions, mostly fever and chills, and often at the end or after the infusion. Only one infusion could not be completed because of an adverse reaction. Three patients were not able to complete the study because of adverse reactions; there were seven reactions in 11 infusions in these three patients, although none of the reactions were considered serious. Overall, in this study, most immunodeficient patients (13/16) were able to tolerate infusion rates of Sandoglobulin two to 10 times higher than the standard rates now recommended. The maximal rate of infusion must be individualized, but for carefully selected patients, infusions of 400 mg/kg can be completed in 1 hour or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Overall, respondents held positive views of consultant dietitians. More than half of the respondents said the image of consultant dietitians had improved over the past 5 years. More than half of nursing directors, dietitians, dietary managers, and medical directors responded that consultant dietitians spent adequate time in facilities to do their jobs. Results of the study indicate that consultant dietitians believe that they are viewed by other health professionals as they actually are: competent, knowledgeable, well-respected, and involved in direct patient care functions. The next challenge is for more consultant dietitians to build on this base and become proactive, developing strong franchises and more opportunities for the profession.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of rapid screening by clinically derived geriatric criteria in predicting outcomes of elderly hospitalized patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 985 patients screened at the time of hospital admission and followed for 1 year with respect to the outcomes of mortality, hospital readmission, and nursing home utilization. SETTING: Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, a tertiary care teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: Male patients 65 years of age and older admitted to the Medical and Surgical services during the period from October 1, 1985 through September 30, 1986. RESULTS: Patients were grouped by specific screening criteria into three groups of increasing frailty: Independent, Frail, and Severely Impaired. Each criterion focused on a geriatric condition and was designed to serve as a marker for frailty. Increasing frailty was significantly correlated with increasing length of hospital stay (P less than 0.0001), nursing home utilization (P less than 0.0001), and mortality (P less than 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the clinical groups were more predictive of mortality and nursing home utilization than were age or Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Rehospitalization was unrelated to age, clinical group, or DRG, suggesting that utilization may not be driven by the clinical factors measured in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid clinical screening using specific geriatric criteria is effective in identifying frail older subjects at risk for mortality and nursing home utilization. Our findings suggest that geriatric syndromes are more predictive of adverse outcomes than diagnosis per se. This well operationalized screening process is inexpensive as well as effective and could easily be introduced into other hospital settings.\r"

The best mechanism for including both types of epitopes within an Ag is dependent upon how the Ag is processed by the APC for presentation to a responsive Th cell. If it is more efficient to process a single molecule for both helper and primary epitopes, than covalent linkage of B cells and T cell epitopes for intramolecular presentation of help would be recommended. If however, separate peptides containing either B or Th cell epitopes could be included within a single complex for the elicitation of intermolecular/intrastructural help, more antigenically diverse structures could be designed. This paper reports that it is possible to generate intermolecular/intrastructural help within an antigenic peptide-phospholipid (PL) complex. These peptide-PL complexes use well defined epitopes from Plasmodium falciparum as Ag. In addition to generating intrastructural help, we have shown that the Ir to these peptide-PL complexes is controlled by Ir genes and is similar to the Ir to the circumsporozoite protein of this pathogen.\r"

Colony-mixing experiments indicated that the failure of most M phi clones to present allo-Ag was not due to their suppression of the ability of CD8+ cells to respond, nor did the nonpresenting clones interfere with the activity of the allo-Ag presenting M phi. The allo-Ag presenting phenotypes were found to be a stable characteristic in a panel of cell lines derived from individual clones of M phi. Analysis of the cell lines revealed that the differential expression of allo-APC activity could not be attributed to the levels of MHC class I molecules; rather, the cell lines and the primary M phi clones differ in their expression of a cell-associated costimulator molecule that likely functions to induce the expression of the IL-2R on and the secretion of IL-2 from the T cells.\r"

Detection of IFN-gamma-PC in cryostat sections of spleen-tissue was performed with an enzyme labeled mAb directed against IFN-gamma. After TNP-Ficoll immunization, IFN-gamma-PC and TNP-specific antibody-forming cells (TNP-AFC) displayed similar kinetics reaching a maximum number at day 5 to 7. The IFN-gamma-PC were localized in the same compartment as TNP-AFC and a part of them in juxtaposition to TNP-AFC. Immunization with other TI-2 Ag resulted also in a significant increase of the number of IFN-gamma-PC. In a parallel experiment we found both in vivo and in an ELISA-spot assay a significant increase of the number of IFN-gamma-PC and IFN-gamma-spot-forming-cells, respectively, in spleens of mice 6 to 7 days after TNP-Ficoll immunization. Double staining of spleen sections for IFN-gamma and surface Ag revealed that 5 to 7 days after TNP-Ficoll immunization, +/- 40% of the IFN-gamma-PC expressed the MT4 Ag (CD4), +/- 50% the Lyt-2+ Ag (CD8) and +/- 10% the asialo-GM1 Ag (NK cell). This study represents the first description of the in vivo activity and characterization of IFN-gamma-PC during a TI-2 immune response. Moreover, the presented data confirm suggestions from in vitro investigations that IFN-gamma and T cells may play a direct role in the in vivo regulation of a primary immune response against a TI-2 Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Development of a C57BL/6-+/+ TCR transgenic mouse containing the rearranged TCR alpha- and beta-chain specific for the Db + HY male Ag results in production of a nearly monoclonal population of early thymocytes expressing the Db + HY reactive TCR. These thymocytes are autoreactive in H-2Db male mice and undergo clonal deletion and down-regulation of CD8. To study the effect of the lpr gene on development of autoreactive T cells, these transgenic mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6-lpr/lpr mice. T cell populations in the thymus and spleen were analyzed by three-color flow cytometry for expression of CD4, CD8, and TCR. The thymus of TCR transgenic H-2b/b lpr/lpr male mice had an increase in percent and absolute number of CD8dull thymocytes compared to TCR transgenic H-2b/b +/+ male mice. However, there was not a complete defect in clonal deletion, because clonal deletion and down-regulation of CD8 was apparent in both +/+ and lpr/lpr H-2Db HY+ male mice compared to H-2Db HY- female mice. The phenotype of splenic T cells was almost identical in TCR transgenic +/+ and lpr/lpr males with about 50% CD4-CD8- T cells and 50% CD8+ T cells. However, there was a dramatic increase in the SMLR proliferative response of splenic T cells from TCR transgenic lpr/lpr males compared to TCR transgenic +/+ males. To determine the specificity of this response, spleen cells from TCR transgenic lpr/lpr and +/+ mice were cultured with irradiated H-2b/b and H-2k/k male and female spleen cells. T cells from TCR transgenic C57BL/6-lpr/lpr male mice had an increased proliferative response to H-2b/b male spleen cells compared to T cells from TCR transgenic C57BL/6(-)+/+ male mice, but both lpr/lpr and +/+ mice had a minimal response to irradiated H-2b/b female or H-2k/k male or female stimulator cells. The splenic T cells from TCR transgenic lpr/lpr mice also had an increased specific cytotoxic activity against H-2b/b male target cells compared to TCR transgenic +/+ mice. These results demonstrate that there is a defect in negative selection of self-reactive T cells in the thymus of lpr/lpr mice and a defect in induction or maintenance of clonal anergy of self-reactive T cells in the periphery of lpr/lpr mice.\r"

  ".U": "91302793\r", 
  ".W": "We have evaluated the TNF production by alveolar macrophages (AM) in 43 HIV-infected subjects in relation with 1) their clinical and biologic status; 2) the presence of lung opportunistic infections (OI); and 3) the expression of HIV by AM. This production was assessed in a standard chromium release test, using monocytic U937 cells as targets. The spontaneous TNF production by AM from patients without lung OI was higher than that from seronegative controls (p less than 0.02). This production by AM was similar to that of blood monocytes, suggesting that it was not related, in these subjects, to any particular lung status. The extent of TNF release by AM was correlated to the presence of a lymphocytic alveolitis (p less than 0.05), and not to the patients' clinical presentation nor to their CD4 cell count. Finally, AM from these subjects could be normally stimulated in vitro by IFN-gamma. On the other hand, it appeared that the spontaneous TNF release by AM shown in vitro to express HIV (p24+ AM) was significantly higher than that by their p24- counterparts (p less than 0.05) and by controls (p less than 0.01). In addition, contrasting with the marked increase of TNF release by p24- AM after their stimulation with IFN-gamma (p less than 0.001), p24+ AM appeared to be refractory to any stimulation by IFN, arguing for their activation in vivo. Finally, the spontaneous TNF release by AM was significantly increased during lung OI, compared with controls (p less than 0.01) as well as with AIDS patients without OI (p less than 0.01). In addition, the production of TNF by AM in these subjects was higher than that by the corresponding blood monocytes (p less than 0.02), suggesting a compartmentalization of this response within the lungs. In conclusion, it appears that the TNF production by AM of seropositive patients is highly related to the presence of lung OI as well as to the expression of HIV by these cells. In the context of the up-regulation of HIV expression induced by TNF in vitro, our data could suggest that the in vivo release of TNF by AM could participate in viral dissemination. Moreover, we hypothesize that the generation of activated AM refractory to any further stimulation could in turn lead to the development of additional pulmonary infections.\r"

  ".U": "91302798\r", 
  ".W": "Normal human foreskin fibroblasts were used to examine transcriptional induction by IL-1 and TNF-alpha of the novel cytokine gro (melanoma growth-stimulating activity). Gro mRNA was expressed at levels 100-fold above background within 45 min of exposure to either IL-1 or TNF-alpha, in growing or serum-starved cells and a similar response was shown by IL-6. In contrast, as shown previously, gro mRNA was elevated only 10-fold by serum in starved but not in growing cells, similar to fos. Thus gro expression appears to be regulated by at least two signal transduction systems: a cytokine pathway, and a growth-related pathway. Three closely related gro genes (alpha, beta, and gamma) have been described. Their proximal 5' regulatory sequences presented here show close similarity in the region to -136, which includes the NF-kappa B site at -66 to -76 in gro alpha and gro gamma, and -64 to -74 in gro beta, and sequence diversity further upstream. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with CAT constructs localized the cytokine response to a region between -84 and -65 in gro beta. Gel retardation studies with FS-2 cells identified a cytokine-induced protein binding at the NF-kappa B site in all three gro genes as shown by competition studies with a pair of oligonucleotides representing wild-type and mutant sequences of the NF-kappa B binding site. Neither serum nor PMA induced a detectable gel shift at NF-kappa B or upstream to position -723. These results demonstrate conservation of the cytokine response element, NF-kappa B, in the three genes, consistent with the conservation of sequence in this region; and suggest that differential expression of the three gro genes may depend upon interactions with other sites located in the divergent upstream region.\r"

  ".W": "A previous report concluded that a new cytokine, designated IL-10, is a growth cofactor for thymocytes, spleen, and lymph node cells. In this report, we have focused on the effects of IL-10 on CD8+ spleen T cells. We first observed that IL-10 enhances the growth of CD8+ T cells to IL-2. We then investigated the effect of murine rIL-10 on the induction of murine effector CTL from CTL precursors (CTL-p) using both bulk and filler cell-free limiting-dilution cultures. IL-10 alone could not induce Con A-activated FACS-sorted CD8+ T cells either to proliferate or to generate effector CTL. In combination with IL-2, however, IL-10 augmented the cytolytic activity of effector CTL generated from Con A-activated spleen CD8+ T cells in bulk cultures incubated for 5 days. In limiting-dilution cultures (using solid-phase anti-CD3 mAb as stimulus), IL-10, in combination with IL-2, substantially increased the CTL-p frequency and augmented the cytolytic activity per clone expanded from one CD8+ T cell when compared with cells cultured in IL-2 alone. Kinetic studies showed that IL-10 is required at both early and late culture stages for optimal generation of effector CTL. The potentiating effects of IL-10 on CTL function were neutralized by an anti-IL-10 mAb. These results indicate that IL-10 has direct effects on mature T cells, and suggest that IL-10 also functions as a cytotoxic T cell differentiation factor, which promotes a higher number of IL-2-activated CTL-p to proliferate and differentiate into effector CTL. In contrast, IL-10 did not enhance significantly the lymphokine-activated killer cell activity of IL-2-grown CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The biologic effects of IFN-gamma are mediated through a receptor that is expressed in relatively low abundance on normal mammalian cells. As a consequence, investigations of the physicochemical and ligand-binding properties of the purified receptor have been limited. The work reported here characterizes a secreted form of the receptor for mouse IFN-gamma, made by deletion of the nucleotides that code for the anchoring domain from a cDNA that encodes the receptor binding protein and its related signal peptide. When transfected into rat XC cells, this construct produced up to approximately 1 mg/liter of a secreted protein that had the characteristics of the native receptor. Both the secreted protein and its mRNA were of sizes that were consistent with loss of the transmembrane region. The protein was detectable by a mAb that is specific for an epitope that is found in the ligand binding site of the receptor for mouse IFN-gamma, as well as by a goat polyclonal IgG that is monospecific for the mouse IFN-gamma R. Supernates that contained the secreted protein blocked binding of IFN-gamma to mouse IFN-gamma R and inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the IFN-gamma-mediated priming of mouse bone marrow culture-derived macrophages for tumor cell killing. Availability of relatively large amounts of a secreted protein that retains ligand-binding activity should facilitate purification and basic studies of the receptor binding protein and could provide new approaches to the treatment/prevention of diseases that arise due to inappropriate response of cells to IFN-gamma. In addition, because this secreted receptor, unlike others, consists of both the extracellular and intracellular domains, it is likely that it will be useful in determining how the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor is involved in receptor function.\r"

  ".W": "Phagocytosis is a specialized function of neutrophils and macrophages that requires coordination of multiple biochemical and biophysical events. Considerable progress has been made in identifying the membrane receptors involved in phagocytosis, but the intracellular signaling pathways that are necessary for particle ingestion are poorly understood. In an effort to address this complex question, we investigated the role of arachidonic acid (AA) in the uptake of yeast and IgG-coated E (EIgG) or C-coated E. Human monocytes, labeled with 3H AA, released this label during phagocytosis of yeast and EIgG, but not in response to EC3b. The PL inhibitors bromophenacyl bromide and manoalide abolished the release of 3H and inhibited phagocytosis of EIgG in parallel. Both drugs caused a similar inhibition of yeast-mediated 3H release but had little effect on yeast ingestion. Similar results were obtained with the inhibitor quinacrine (mepacrine). Exogenously added AA and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid restored bromophenacyl bromide-inhibited EIgG ingestion; arachidonate analogs eicosatrienoic acid and eicosapentanoic acid did not. Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways for AA metabolism by indomethacin or BW755C did not affect EIgG phagocytosis, demonstrating that these major AA metabolic pathways are not involved in phagocytic signaling. These experiments suggest that release of AA is essential for EIgG ingestion and that phagocytosis in monocytes proceeds by at least two mechanisms, one dependent on AA (EIgG) and one independent of it (yeast).\r"

  ".U": "91302819\r", 
  ".W": "We determined the ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit rat basophilic leukemia cell mediator release induced by anti-IgE and by neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity (HRA-N). Serotonin release induced by HRA-N and anti-IgE was inhibited by 78 +/- 5 and 70 +/- 4%, respectively (IC50 7.5 x 10(-7)M) by hydrocortisone (10(-5)M). HRA-N does not cause arachidonic acid metabolism, however, anti-IgE induced the generation of PGD2 and leukotriene (LT)C4, and the generation of both mediators was inhibited by 10(-5)M hydrocortisone (IC50 = 4.8 x 10(-7)M, and 3.6 x 10(-9)M, respectively). Inhibition required at least 5 to 6 h of hydrocortisone exposure and was maximal after 22 h. The observed effects of hydrocortisone could be reproduced by human recombinant lipocortin-I (5 x 10(-7)M). Hydrocortisone, 10(-5)M, was a less potent inhibitor of calcium ionophore A23187-mediated serotonin release and PGD2 and LTC4 generation (inhibition of 20 +/- 2, 17 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 10%, respectively). Inasmuch as A23187-induced stimulation is not dependent on receptor coupling, the enhanced ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit IgE- and HRA-N-mediated events as compared with A23187 suggests that one possible site of action of hydrocortisone may be interruption of receptor-effector signals. In the presence of arachidonic acid, hydrocortisone-treated cells released as much LTB4 and PGD2 as control cells, however, serotonin release and LTC4 generation were inhibited 50 and 55%, respectively. Thus, these data suggest that hydrocortisone has three possible sites of action: 1) inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, 2) inhibition of glutathione-s-transferase, and 3) inhibition of serotonin release by a third mechanism, possibly by interrupting the coupling of receptor and effector systems.\r"

  ".W": "The susceptibility to infection by human herpes-virus 6 (HHV-6) of mature human T lymphocytes belonging to the two major subpopulations (i.e., CD3+ CD4+ CD8- and CD3+ CD4- CD8+) was investigated by using CD4+ or CD8+ T cell populations and clones derived from normal adult peripheral blood. Productive HHV-6 infection was observed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. By days 2 to 6 after infection, increasing numbers of cells exhibited characteristic morphologic alterations, becoming enlarged, uniformly rounded and refractile as a consequence of the virus-induced cytopathic effect. During the course of HHV-6 infection, analysis of the surface membrane phenotype of the T cell populations and clones revealed a progressive decline in the expression of the CD3/TCR complex, whereas other T cell-associated markers (e.g., CD2) were unaffected. Northern blot analysis of mRNA extracted from HHV-6-infected T cells demonstrated a dramatic loss of the specific messages for the gamma-, delta-, and epsilon-chains of CD3. Infection by HHV-6, but not by HSV-1 or human CMV, elicited CD3/TCR down-regulation also in the neoplastic T cell line Jurkat. The down-regulation of CD3/TCR was dependent upon live virus infection, because previous inactivation of HHV-6 by heat (56 degrees C for 1 h) or UV light (16 J/m2) totally abrogated the effect. Expression of the immediate early or early genes of HHV-6 was not sufficient to induce CD3/TCR modulation, as indicated by studies with the viral DNA polymerase inhibitor phosphonoformic acid. The observation that both major subsets of mature TCR-alpha beta+ T lymphocytes are susceptible to HHV-6 infection indicates that this virus may have a broad spectrum of activity on the immune system. The transcriptional down-regulation of the CD3/TCR complex, by affecting a critical T cell recognition function, could be relevant to HHV-6 pathogenesis.\r"

After stimulation with phorbol, 12,13, dibutyrate and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, which triggers a rapid entry of cells into G1 phase, we demonstrated Rb phosphorylation 24 h later, well before the onset of DNA synthesis. This finding, in contrast to reports using proliferating cell lines, implies that Rb phosphorylation is not a proximal event regulating the G1 to S transition. The production of p53 became detectable 3 to 6 h after addition of phorbol, 12,13,-dibutyrate and ionomycin, and peaked at 30 to 42 h. To further delineate the relationship of the synthesis and metabolism of the proteins to cell cycle progression, we used three agents to arrest progression of activated T cells at various points in the cell cycle. Aphidicolin arrested the cells at the G1/S boundary, whereas deferoxamine, an iron chelator, arrested the cells at an earlier stage of the cell cycle. Cyclosporin A blocked T cell activation at the earliest point in the cell cycle. In the presence of aphidicolin, Rb phosphorylation and p53 production proceeded normally whereas cyclosporin A inhibited both events. Although deferoxamine completely prevented Rb phosphorylation, p53 production was unaffected, suggesting a differential regulation of the two molecules. Our results place Rb phosphorylation and p53 production in the hierarchy of genetic events that are thought to regulate T lymphocyte progression through the cell cycle.\r"

  ".U": "91302825\r", 
  ".W": "Rearrangement of Ag receptor genes requires recognition by the lymphocyte recombinase of heptamer-nonamer signal sequences followed by two endonucleolytic cleavages and two DNA ligations to form the coding and signal joints. The phenomenon of trans-rearrangement, in which Ag receptor gene segments located on different chromosomes recombine to yield chimeric products, provides an in vivo system in which to investigate the ability of the recombinase to carry out each of these functions in trans. Trans-rearrangements between TCRG and TCRD loci, similar in structure and frequency to those observed previously in human lymphoid tissues, were demonstrated in normal mouse thymus by PCR with crossed V gamma/J delta and V delta/J gamma primer pairs. A simple mechanistic model for trans-rearrangement was then tested. This model posits an ability of the recombinase to catalyze the formation of both coding and signal joints in trans and therefore predicts that trans-rearrangements will generate chimeric signal joints. In adult thymus, chimeric D delta 2-J gamma 1 and D delta 2-J gamma 2 signal joints, containing fused heptamer-nonamer sequences, could be detected by PCR and were each present at frequencies sufficient to account for a large proportion of the corresponding TCRG/TCRD trans-rearrangements. In agreement with the predictions of the model, chimeric signal joints were found as both linear chromosomal and circular episomal DNA. The results provide a framework for understanding the formation of chromosomal translocations in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells and support the possibility of a looping mechanism for standard gene rearrangement. To test the form of regulation of TCRG rearrangement, the frequencies of specific signal joints from standard and trans-rearrangements were compared. Although J gamma 1 and J gamma 2 segments participated with equal frequency in trans-rearrangement with D delta 2, only the J gamma 1 segment participated in standard rearrangement with V gamma 5. The results suggest that V-J recombination in the TCRG locus is regulated directly at the DNA level by cis-acting constraints which do not affect the accessibility of individual TCRG gene segments to recombination in trans.\r"

  ".W": "A specific and potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, okadaic acid (OA), and its inactive analog, tetramethyl ether (OA-TME), were tested in the cytotoxicity and granule exocytosis assays of CTL activation. At low concentrations OA enhanced, whereas at higher concentrations OA inhibited, CTL responses. The Ag-specific and retargeted cytotoxicity, granule exocytosis induced by target cell (TC), anti-TCR mAb, or PMA and A23187, and conjugate formation with TC were inhibited by pretreatment of CTL with OA as expected if protein phosphatases and protein dephosphorylation were indeed involved in the TCR-mediated signal transduction and effector responses of CTL. Cytotoxicity and granule exocytosis were unaffected by pretreatment of CTL with OA-TME. The inhibitory effect of OA on the exocytic response of CTL induced by TC and anti-TCR mAb can be dissociated from the inhibition of the response to PMA and A23187, suggesting the involvement of a serine and/or threonine protein phosphatase in the early events of transmembrane signaling. At lower concentrations, OA, but not OA-TME, was able to enhance the Ag-specific cytotoxicity and TC-induced exocytosis from CTL clones. The enhancement of these TCR-mediated responses of CTL was observed only if the activation was induced by the Ag on the TC surface, because OA did not enhance either the anti-TCR mAb-induced exocytosis of granules from the CTL clone or lysis of the Ag-nonbearing TC by CTL in a retargeting assay. The biphasic character of the effects of OA on CTL-TC interactions suggests the existence of at least two functionally distinct phosphatases in CTL. The ability of OA to enhance the Ag-specific response is unique and indicates the presence of an inhibitory phosphoprotein phosphatase that should be considered as a participant in the down-regulation of the cell-cell interactions between CTL and TC. The inhibitory effects of OA on both TC-induced and anti-TCR mAb-triggered CTL responses at higher concentrations point to the importance of yet another phosphatase in the CTL-TC interactions and in the TCR-mediated transmembrane signaling. The use of OA may help to decipher the details of biochemical changes involved in T lymphocyte effector functions.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, particularly in the microvasculature, are important for the initiation and regulation of tissue inflammation. These interactions are regulated by the recognition of specific cell adhesion molecules (CAM) on both leukocytes and endothelial cells. In this study, we examined the modulation of cell surface expression of MHC antigens and the CAM intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), lymphocyte function antigen 3 (LFA-3), and CD44 on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) both grown in monolayers and differentiated into capillary-like structures on the basement membrane-like substrate matrigel. HDMEC grown in monolayers or differentiated on matrigel express comparable cell surface MHC class I, LFA-3, CD44, and ICAM-1. ICAM-1, but not LFA-3 or CD44, was increased in expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner by interleukin 1 (IL-1) alpha, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or interferon (IFN) gamma. Comparable upregulation was observed both in cells grown in monolayers and cells differentiated on matrigel. IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, and LPS increased ICAM-1 expression on average 100-200% whereas IFN gamma was somewhat less potent. Comparative studies with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) demonstrated consistently lower levels of ICAM-1 expression on HUVEC, but greater increases after cytokine stimulation. Pretreatment with dexamethasone or transforming growth factor (TGF) beta did not affect baseline expression of ICAM-1 or inhibit upregulation of ICAM-1 on HDMEC by IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, LPS, or IFN gamma. Both IFN gamma and TNF alpha, but not IL-1 alpha increased MHC class I expression, whereas only IFN gamma induced the expression of HLA-DR on HDMEC. The effect of IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, or IFN gamma was inhibited by antibody to the specific cytokine, but was unaffected by antibody to other cytokines. Additionally, IFN alpha or beta inhibited upregulation of HLA-DR by IFN gamma, but had no effect on the increased MHC class I or ICAM-1 expression mediated by this cytokine. These data demonstrate that the expression of CAM and MHC antigens on small vessel-derived endothelial cells is different from that observed on large-vessel HUVEC, is regulated by the presence of multiple cytokines operating via distinct pathways, and the expression and regulation of these proteins appear to be similar on cells that have been grown in monolayers to those morphologically differentiated into blood vessel-like structures.\r"

  ".U": "91302876\r", 
  ".W": "To begin to characterize the 230-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPA) gene, we performed Southern analysis on genomic DNA with probes derived from 7 kb of cDNA that spans most of the coding region of this hemidesmosomal plaque protein. When hybridized to a 1-kb fragment of this BPA cDNA, normal human genomic DNA digested with EcoRI, BamHI, PstI, HindIII, or EcoRV showed only a single band, which was unique for each enzyme, indicating a single human gene for BPA. To determine if a related gene exists in animals, we used probes covering the full 7 kb of cDNA for Southern analysis of genomic DNA from various vertebrates. A related gene was detected in other mammals (monkey, cow, dog, rabbit, mouse, and rat) but not in chicken, frog, or fish. Under these same hybridization conditions a probe for human beta-actin could detect an actin gene in all these species. Furthermore, immunofluorescence showed that an antibody raised against portions of the 230-kD BPA bound to the epidermal basement membrane of mammals but not that of a bird or amphibian. Finally, because most patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) have defective hemidesmosomes in ultrastructure, and probably function, we analyzed genomic DNA from these patients. No restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) were detected when the DNA from 11 normals and 8 JEB patients (representing 16 possible defective genes) was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, or PstI and hybridized to any part of the cDNA. These findings indicate that 1) there is a single BPA gene in humans; 2) a closely related gene exists in other mammals but not birds, amphibia, or fish; and 3) gross abnormalities of the BPA gene are not characteristic of JEB patients.\r"

  ".W": "Nidogen is a sulfated multifunctional glycoprotein present in basement membranes. In this study, we have cloned the 5'-flanking region of the human nidogen gene. Initially, an approximately 35-kb DNA clone (NCos4) was isolated from a human cosmid genomic library. Southern hybridization of EcoRI-digested NCos4 allowed isolation of a 3.7-kb fragment, which was shown to contain a portion of intron 1, the entire exon 1, and approximately 0.9 kb of 5'-flanking sequences of the nidogen gene. Nucleotide sequencing of the 5'-flanking DNA revealed the presence of two canonic CCAAT consensus sequences in the antisense strand and a potential variant of the TATA motif, TATTT, in the sense strand. One putative AP-2 and six putative SP1 binding sites were also present. To test the functional promoter activity of the 5'-flanking genomic DNA, two nidogen promoter/CAT reporter gene constructs, with the promoter segment spanning from -864 to -1 and from -534 to -1, respectively, were developed and analyzed in transient transfections of human and mouse cell cultures. Both constructs showed clearly detectable promoter activity, and the activity of the larger construct could be up-regulated by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate up to 2.5 times. The results indicate that the nidogen promoter/CAT gene constructs developed in this study provide a means to examine the transcriptional regulation of nidogen gene expression in human diseases of the basement membrane zone.\r"

  ".W": "Synthesis of 12- and/or 15-HETE by human epidermal cells was investigated after separating basal cells from suprabasal epidermal cell layers. We found that the main metabolite of 3H-arachidonic acid (3H-AA), formed by freshly prepared upper epidermal layers (stratum granulosum and spinosum), upon RP-HPLC co-eluted with authentic 3H-12-HETE. A 3H-15-HETE co-eluting peak selectively occurred in chromatograms obtained from supernatants of fractions containing basal cells. Supernatants of freshly prepared suspensions rich in basal keratinocytes appeared to contain 3H-15-HETE as their main 3H-AA metabolite, by far exceeding the recovered amounts of 3H-12-HETE. Moreover, keratinocytes cultured for 1 week or longer were found to produce predominantly a 3H-AA metabolite co-eluting with 3H-15-HETE. In supernatants of cultured cells, little if any 3H-12-HETE was detectable. Cultured human skin fibroblasts were not found to produce relevant amounts of HETE. Genuine tissue rich in basal cells, i.e., cells of hair follicles, were found to form twice as much 3H-15-HETE as 3H-12-HETE (3H-15-HETE/3H-12-HETE-ratio = 1.9 +/- 0.8; n = 7). Apparently, different epidermal layers are able to produce a characteristic pattern of 3H-AA metabolites. 3H-15-HETE generation seems to be a marker for proliferating keratinocytes, whereas 3H-12-HETE formation appears to be typical for differentiating suprabasal epidermal cells. Our results may explain the heretofore varying patterns of AA-metabolites by keratinocytes reported in the literature.\r"

The binding of oleic acid and arachidonic acid with rat epidermal cytosol was rapid, saturable, and reversible. Binding of oleic acid was competed out with the simultaneous addition of other ligands and found to be in the following order: arachidonic acid greater than oleic acid greater than linoleic acid greater than lauric acid greater than leukotriene A4 greater than 15-HETE = PGE1 greater than PGE2 = PGF2. Scatchard analysis of the binding with arachidonic acid, oleic acid, and retinoic acid revealed high-affinity binding sites with the dissociation constant in the nM range. SDS-PAGE analysis of the oleic acid-bound epidermal cytosolic protein(s) revealed maximum binding at the 14.5 kDa region. The presence of the fatty acid-binding protein in epidermal cytosol and its binding to fatty acids and retinoic acid may be of significance both in the trafficking and the metabolism of fatty acids and retinoids across the skin.\r"

The medium requirements for human melanocyte in vitro growth are phorbol esters, agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels, hormones, and growth factors. Cellular jun, jun-B, and c-fos gene expression are known to be affected by growth promoting agents. In primary melanocytes, the expression of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcripts was dependent on the growth-promoting agents present in the medium. Uniformly high c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcript levels were observed in melanocytes cultivated in complete medium. Higher levels of c-jun RNA transcripts and low levels of c-fos RNA transcripts were observed in melanocytes cultivated in plain medium. In contrast, a range of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcript levels was detected in metastatic melanoma cell strains cultivated in medium with or without serum. In general, an increase in jun-B and c-fos RNA transcript expression and a decrease in c-jun RNA transcript expression was observed in metastatic melanomas compared to neonatal melanocytes. These data suggest a potential role for c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos genes in the transformation of melanocytes to malignant melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of human recombinant interferon-alpha-2a (rIFN-alpha), natural interferon-beta (nIFN-beta) and recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) on the proliferation, morphology and antigen expression of cultured human melanocytes were studied in vitro. The investigations were performed in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)- and serum-containing melanocyte growth medium (MGM), in TPA- and serum-free complete melanocyte medium (CMM) and its mitogen reduced variant (RMM). In MGM, none of these interferons inhibited the growth of normal melanocytes at concentrations 1-10,000 international units (IU)/ml over a period of 5 d. Only nIFN-beta, dose dependently, inhibited melanocyte proliferation in CMM and RMM in a 6- and 12-d assay (growth inhibition at 10,000 IU/ml; 77-80% of the controls, p less than 0.001). In contrast, rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma exerted no (RMM), or minor effects (CMM) on melanocyte proliferation (only in 12-d assays at 10,000 IU/ml: 24% and 21% of the controls respectively, p less than 0.01). In parallel experiments performed on melanoma cells, all three interferons were potent inhibitors of proliferation in a 5-d serum-free assay (growth inhibition at 10,000 IU/ml; rIFN-alpha 59%, nIFN-beta 78%, rIFN-gamma 56%, all p less than 0.001). In addition, nIFN-beta and also rIFN-gamma caused striking morphologic changes of normal melanocytes in vitro. Especially under greater than or equal to 10 IU/ml rIFN-gamma cytoplasmic spreading and flattening of the cultured melanocytes and their nuclei were seen, thus resembling melanoma cells in vitro. Untreated human melanocytes grown in MGM showed high expression of the melanoma-associated antigens HMB-45 (95-100%) and K.1.2 (40-100%), whereas the progression marker A.1.43 was present only on less than 5% of the cells. Cultured melanocytes were 95-100% positive for histocompatibility antigen class I (HLA-I), 30-75% were positive for ICAM-1, whereas they were negative for HLA-DR. After treatment with rIFN-alpha, increased expression of HLA-I antigens was found; nIFN-beta and rIFN-gamma decreased the labeling with HMB-45 (75-100%) and with K.1.2 (25-80%), whereby the expression of A.1.43 was found slightly increased (5-15%). The HLA class I antigens were upregulated by both nIFN-beta and rIFN-gamma, nIFN-beta being the most potent agent. Also, both nIFN-beta and rIFN-gamma increased the expression of ICAM-1 (nIFN-beta, 75-90%; rIFN-gamma, 90-95%) and induced de novo expression of HLA-DR antigen (nIFN-beta, 15-20%; rIFN-gamma, 65-95%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Many authors suggest that increased nasal resistance to respiration may cause disturbances in the pulmonary ventilation and carry the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea and/or cardiopulmonary syndrome. This study comprised 30 children complaining of long-standing nasal obstruction due to enlarged adenoids. Adenoidectomy was performed and the arterial blood gases were measured before and one month after surgery. Twelve normal children were also included as controls. Statistical evaluation of the results showed that O2 saturation and arterial O2 tension (PaO2) were significantly low before the operation, and increased significantly after surgery. Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was insignificantly low before operation, but decreased significantly after adenoidectomy. It was concluded that enlarged adenoid may be associated with ventilatory impairment which is reversible after adenoidectomy.\r"

We quantified the response of various respiratory gas analyzers to the aerosol propellant of albuterol inhalant (Proventil). The mass spectrometer systems tested, two Advantage systems, a SARA system, and a Model 6000 Ohmeda system, all displayed artifactual readings in response to the albuterol propellant. Each metered dose of the Proventil brand of albuterol contains 4 ml of Freon 11 (trichloromonofluoromethane) and 11 ml of Freon 12 (dichlorodifluoromethane). The concentration of propellant was expressed in doses/L, where each liter of gas contains 0.4 vol % of Freon 11 and 1.1 vol % of Freon 12 per dose. In proportion to the concentration of albuterol propellant, the two Advantage systems showed substantial readings of isoflurane (%) when no isoflurane was present (13% and 16% per dose/L) and reduced readings of enflurane (-8% and -10% per dose/L) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (-3 and +5 mm Hg per dose/L). The SARA system showed substantial CO2 readings when no CO2 was present (5 mm Hg per dose/L) and displayed small enflurane readings (0.1% per dose/L) when no enflurane was present. The Model 6000 unit showed CO2 readings when no CO2 was present (5 mm Hg per dose/L). Neither the Raman spectrometer, the infrared spectrometers, nor the piezoadsorptive analyzer we tested showed an artifactual effect of albuterol propellant on any of its readings. Simulation and clinical tests demonstrated that a single dose of albuterol propellant into a breathing circuit at the onset of inspiration resulted in concentrations of 0.8 and 0.3 dose/L, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Substantial mean differences between arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) and end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2) in anesthesia and intensive care settings have been demonstrated by a number of investigators. We have explored the technical causes of error in the measurement of PETCO2 that could contribute to the observed differences. In a clinical setting, the measurement of PETCO2 is accomplished with one of three types of instruments, infrared analyzers, mass spectrometers, and Raman spectrometers, whose specified accuracies are typically +/- 2, +/- 1.5, and +/- 0.5 mm Hg, respectively. We examined potential errors in PETCO2 measurement with respect to the analyzer, sampling system, environment, and instrument. Various analyzer error sources were measured, including stability, warm-up time, interference from nitrous oxide and oxygen, pressure, noise, and response time. Other error sources, including calibration, resistance in the sample catheter, pressure changes, water vapor, liquid water, and end-tidal detection algorithms, were considered and are discussed. On the basis of our measurements and analysis, we estimate the magnitude of the major potential errors for an uncompensated infrared analyzer as: inaccuracy, 2 mm Hg; resolution, 0.5 mm Hg; noise, 2 mm Hg; instability (12 hours), 3 mm Hg; miscalibration, 1 mm Hg; selectivity (70% nitrous oxide), 6.5 mm Hg; selectivity (100% oxygen), -2.5 mm Hg; atmospheric pressure change, less than 1 mm Hg; airway pressure at 30 cm H2O, 2 mm Hg; positive end-expiratory pressure or continuous positive airway pressure at 20 cm H2O, 1.5 mm Hg; sampling system resistance, less than 1 mm Hg; and water vapor, 2.5 mm Hg. In addition to these errors, other systematic mistakes such as an inaccurate end-tidal detection algorithm, poor calibration technique, or liquid water contamination can lead to gross inaccuracies. In a clinical setting, unless the user is confident that all of the technical error sources have been eliminated and the physiologic factors are known, depending on PETCO2 to determine PaCO2 is not advised.\r"

We conducted a double-blind study in 173 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients of etidronate disodium (EHDP), a diphosphonate compound that reduces bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclastic activity. The patients were randomly assigned to receive oral EHDP 5 mg/kg/d or placebo until death or discontinuation due to intolerance or refusal. The extent of vertebral deformity was measured by a vertebral index as well as height. The frequency of pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and bone pain was regularly assessed, as well as size and number of osteolytic lesions. All patients received melphalan and prednisone daily for 4 days every 4 weeks as the primary chemotherapy for their disease. Although the repeated measures analysis showed a significant height loss, there was no difference between treatment arms (P = .98). There was no significant difference in bone pain, episodes of hypercalcemia, or development of pathologic fractures. Patients on EHDP showed less deterioration in their vertebral index, but this difference only approached statistical significance (P = .07). We conclude that EHDP therapy used in this dosage schedule does not have a clinically significant impact in multiple myeloma.\r"

  ".W": "Hypercalcemia is a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Gallium nitrate and the bisphosphonate, etidronate, are new agents that have recently become available for treatment of this disorder. To directly compare therapeutic effectiveness, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of gallium nitrate compared with etidronate for acute control of cancer-related hypercalcemia. Gallium nitrate was administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 200 mg/m2/d. Etidronate was administered as a 4-hour IV infusion at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg. Both drugs were given daily for 5 consecutive days. Eligible patients had persistent moderate-to-severe hypercalcemia (total serum calcium [corrected for serum albumin] greater than or equal to 12.0 mg/dL) after 2 days of hospitalization and IV hydration. Seventy-one patients were randomized and treated. Twenty-eight of 34 patients (82%) who received gallium nitrate achieved normocalcemia compared with 16 of 37 patients (43%) who received etidronate (P less than .001). Patients who received etidronate required significantly greater amounts of IV fluids (P = .04) and more hypocalcemic drug treatment (P less than .05) during the poststudy period than patients who received gallium nitrate. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly longer median duration of normocalcemia for patients treated with gallium nitrate (8 days v 0 days, P = .0005). A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with gallium nitrate developed asymptomatic hypophosphatemia compared with patients treated with etidronate (97% v 43%, P less than .001). We conclude that gallium nitrate is highly effective and superior to etidronate for acute control of moderate-to-severe cancer-related hypercalcemia.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture were administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) directly into the basal subarachnoid cisterns after minimal surgical clot removal and aneurysm clipping. Preoperatively, 13 patients had diffuse or localized thick subarachnoid blood clots on computerized tomography (CT), and two had diffuse thin clots. The rt-PA was given as a single intraoperative injection of 7.5 mg (one patient), 10 mg (nine patients), or 15 mg (five patients). Postoperative cisternal drainage was employed in three patients. All patients except one demonstrated partial to complete cisternal clot clearance on CT scans within 24 hours after surgery. The patient who showed no clot reduction was the only patient in this series to develop symptomatic vasospasm and was the only fatality, dying 8 days after rupture. No vasospasm was seen on follow-up cerebral angiography in six of the 14 responding patients, and mild-to-moderate arterial narrowing was seen in at least one major cerebral artery in the remaining eight patients. Severe angiographic vasospasm was not seen, although the patient who died did not undergo repeat angiography. There was one major complication early in the series which seemed clearly related to treatment, and that was a large extradural hematoma occurring within several hours of craniotomy. Intrathecal fibrinolytic treatment appears effective in clearing subarachnoid clot and reducing vasospasm, and may be associated with acceptable risks if given to patients with large-volume subarachnoid hemorrhages at high risk for severe vasospasm.\r"

  ".U": "91303215\r", 
  ".W": "Recent laboratory studies have demonstrated that intracisternal administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) can facilitate the normal clearing of blood from the subarachnoid space and prevent or ameliorate delayed arterial spasm. The results of a preliminary Phase I trial of intracisternal rt-PA in 10 patients are reported with documented aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). All patients enrolled were classified as clinical Grade III or IV (according to Hunt and Hess) with thick clots or layers of blood in the basal cisterns and major cerebral fissures (Fisher Grade 3). Ventriculostomy and surgery for clipping of the aneurysms were performed within 48 hours of hemorrhage. In one patient, 10 mg rt-PA was instilled into the subarachnoid cisterns prior to closing the dura. In the remaining nine patients, a small silicone catheter was left in the subarachnoid space and rt-PA (5 mg in four cases or 1.5 mg (0.5 mg every 8 hours for three infusions) in five cases) was instilled 12 to 24 hours after surgery. Minor local bleeding complications were noted in all patients receiving 5 or 10 mg rt-PA. Oozing was noted at the operative incision site in four of five patients and at the ventriculostomy site in two patients. One patient developed a small epidural hematoma that was treated by delayed drainage. No bleeding complications were noted in the patients receiving the lower regimen of rt-PA (three infusions of 0.5 mg each). Serial coagulation studies demonstrated no evidence of systemic fibrinolysis. Analysis of cisternal cerebrospinal fluid samples revealed thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels for 24 to 48 hours. Follow-up cerebral angiography 7 to 8 days after rupture disclosed mild to moderate spasm in nine patients, while one patient with hemorrhage from a posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm had severe focal spasm of the vertebral arteries that was not symptomatic. These results suggest that postoperative treatment with rt-PA may be effective in reducing the severity of delayed cerebral vasospasm. The results of serial t-PA levels suggest that the lower dosage regimen with divided dosages at 8-hour intervals is well tolerated and that even lower dosages may be effective. Further studies are clearly indicated.\r"

The patients included fulfilled the following criteria: operation was performed by Day 3 after the hemorrhage, CT showed only blood in the basal cisterns, and the patient had a single aneurysm or multiple aneurysms that could be treated surgically at the same operation. The patients were divided into groups of 10, with patients receiving 3, 10, or 13 mg of rt-PA in a single intracisternal injection at the end of the operation. There were no differences between the treatment groups in overall outcome. One patient from the 3-mg rt-PA group developed a postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage, and one patient from the 10-mg rt-PA group had a postoperative epidural hematoma. There was one death in the 13-mg rt-PA group that was caused by inclusion of a segment of pericallosal artery in the clip. In all treatment groups a reduction was observed in the amount of blood seen on the postoperative CT scans compared to the preoperative CT scans. The reduction in SAH grade between the 10-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was significant (p less than 0.05). The difference in the severity of angiographic vasospasm between the 3-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was also significant (p less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "In normo- or hyperglycemic (i.v. infusion of 50 mg/kg/min glucose over 30 min) pithed rats, diazoxide (1 mg/kg/min i.v. over 20 min) significantly reduced plasma insulin content. By contrast, cromakalim, nicorandil or RP 52891 even at doses 40-fold higher than those producing the same hypotensive effect as diazoxide in intact anesthetized normotensive rats, failed to change insulin plasma levels. Glibenclamide (0.01-0.3 mg/kg i.v.) pretreatment antagonized dose-dependently the hypoinsulinemic activity of diazoxide with an i.v. ED50 value of 49 +/- 1 microgram/kg. In pithed rats, diazoxide increased markedly plasma renin activity. This effect was almost inhibited completely by 20 mg/kg i.v., but not at all by a 1-mg/kg i.v. dose of glibenclamide. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, diazoxide (0.5-2 mg/kg/min i.v. over 20 min) produced decreases in mean carotid artery blood pressure which were antagonized dose-dependently by glibenclamide (5-20 mg/kg i.v.). This sulfonylurea (20 mg/kg i.v.) also prevented the hypotensive effects of several i.v. administered K+ channel activators (cromakalim, RP 52891 and nicorandil) but not those of numerous hypotensive agents such as acetylcholine, adenosine, bradykinin, clonidine, histamine, salbutamol, dihydralazine, papaverine, platelet aggregating factor, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrendipine and diltiazem. Although glibenclamide lowered plasma glucose levels, its blocking activity vis-a-vis the hypotension evoked by cromakalim was not affected when its hypoglycemic effects were reversed with an i.v. injection of glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nitroglycerin potently dilates large coronary arteries but has minimal effect on coronary resistance vessels. Thus, nitroglycerin is not likely to be converted to vasoactive intermediates in small coronary microvessels (less than 100 microns diameter). Because nitroglycerin biotransformation may involve sulfhydryl groups, the effect of L-cysteine on the dilation caused by nitroglycerin (1 nM to 10 microM) was examined in small (80-100 microns in diameter) and large (190-300 microns in diameter) porcine coronary microvessels. Vessels were pressurized in a no-flow state and preconstricted with acetylcholine, then visualized by means of an in vitro microvessel imaging apparatus. Under control conditions, nitroglycerin caused potent dilations of large coronary microvessels, while having minimal effects on small coronary microvessels [peak relaxations 90 +/- 3 vs. 20 +/- 7% (mean +/- S.E.M.) of preconstricted diameter, respectively]. L-Cysteine (100 microM) markedly enhanced relaxations of small coronary microvessels (peak relaxation 96 +/- 2%), while having no effect on relaxations of large coronary microvessels. Ethacrynic acid, which alkylates sulfhydryl groups, markedly inhibited relaxations of large coronary microvessels (peak relaxation = 31 +/- 9%) yet had a minimal effect on the small relaxations of small coronary microvessels to nitroglycerin. Thus, when sulfhydryl groups are made available, small coronary microvessels are markedly responsive to nitroglycerin. This suggests that small coronary microvessels normally lack the reductive capacity to convert nitroglycerin to its active metabolites. Prussian blue stains of sulfhydryl groups in large and small coronary microvessels were qualitatively similar. Thus, small coronary microvessels do not lack sulfhydryl groups but may be deficient in a critical pool necessary for nitroglycerin biotransformation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intrathecal pretreatment with the neurotoxins capsaicin, 6-hydroxydopamine and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine on spinal antinociception by adenosine analogs (NECA, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine and CHA, N6-cyclohexyl adenosine) and morphine were examined using the rat tail flick and hot plate tests. Pretreatment with 50 micrograms capsaicin for 7 to 11 days (which reduced substance P immunoreactivity in the superficial layers of the dorsal spinal cord) produced a slight increase in the action of NECA and CHA, and reduced the action on morphine in the hot plate test but not in the tail flick test. Pretreatment with 50 to 100 micrograms 6-hydroxydopamine for 7 to 14 days (which reduced spinal cord noradrenaline levels by 54-65%) reduced spinal antinociception by NECA and CHA but not that by morphine. Pretreatment with 50 micrograms 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (which reduced spinal cord serotonin levels by 74-89%) had no effect on any agent. Acute pretreatment with 7.5-30 micrograms phentolamine reduced the spinal antinociceptive action of noradrenaline, NECA and CHA, primarily in the hot plate test. Phentolamine (30 micrograms) also reduced the action of morphine (hot plate greater than tail flick), but did not affect the action of L-baclofen. These results suggest that spinal antinociception by adenosine analogs: 1) occurs primarily at a postsynaptic site of action (capsaicin results), and 2) is dependent on release of endogenous noradrenaline and activation of spinal adrenergic receptors (6-hydroxydopamine and phentolamine results). The reduction in the effect of morphine by capsaicin (removes a source of adenosine release) and phentolamine (antagonizes the action of endogenously released adenosine) can be explained in terms of the adenosine release hypothesis of morphine action within the spinal cord.\r"

  ".W": "The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) induces a large number of pharmacological effects. In the present study we demonstrate that a novel 8-OH-DPAT analog, (S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin [(S)-UH-301], is able to antagonize completely the following (R)-8-OH-DPAT-induced effects in the rat: 1) reduction in brain 5-HT biosynthesis, measured as a decreased 5-hydroxytryptophan-accumulation after decarboxylase inhibition; 2) induction of the 5-HT1A behavior (flat body posture, forepaw treading and hindlimb abduction) in reserpine-pretreated animals; 3) reduction of body temperature; 4) inhibition of the cage-leaving response; and 5) reduction of 5-hydroxytryptophan- and quipazine-induced wet dog shakes. In addition, (S)-UH-301 reverses the 5-HT-induced inhibition of the forskolin stimulated cyclic AMP production in rat hippocampus without producing any effects per se in this assay. It is shown that high doses of (S)-UH-301 decrease rat brain biosynthesis of dopamine. These and previous data indicate that (S)-UH-301 also is a weakly potent dopamine-receptor agonist, but with a lower affinity for D2 as compared to 5-HT1A receptors. Thus, the data suggest that (S)-UH-301 is a 5-HT1A-receptor antagonist without intrinsic activity. Therefore, it is likely that (S)-UH-301 will become a valuable pharmacological tool in future 5-HT research.\r"

These patients usually take p.o. hypoglycemic agents to control their diabetes. Because of the reported adverse effects of CsA on glucose metabolism as well as its potential use in Type II diabetics, we were interested in evaluating the in vivo effect of CsA on the activity of p.o. hypoglycemic agents. We also wanted to determine if tolbutamide produced any adverse effects on the pharmacokinetics of CsA. Male, Holtzman rats were administered CsA (p.o.) followed 1 hr later with the hypoglycemic agent. Two hours later, blood samples were obtained to determine blood glucose levels. Animals treated with CsA alone produced a significant hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemic effects produced by tolbutamide and glyburide were inhibited in animals treated concomitantly with CsA. This inhibitory effect was not observed during the first 3 hr of CsA-treatment, could not be overcome by increasing the dose of the hypoglycemic agent and occurred using small doses. CsA did not, however, interfere with the activity of exogenous NPH insulin. Tolbutamide was found to have no effect on the acute pharmacokinetics of CsA. The distribution of CsA was similar to controls in all tissues studied except the liver in which CsA levels were less in tolbutamide-treated animals. These studies demonstrate that CsA interferes with the effects of p.o. hypoglycemic agents and, therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored closely in Type II diabetic patients taking combinations of these drugs.\r"

Declamping was accompanied in unshunted patients by decreases in core temperature of up to 1 degree C and acute decreases in PaO2. Marked respiratory and metabolic acidosis occurred with declamping. Respiratory acidosis resolved within 30 minutes with hyperventilation, but metabolic acidosis persisted despite bicarbonate therapy (mean = 1.2 mEq/kg) up to 6 hours after declamping. Associated elevations in serum potassium resolved as pH returned to baseline. Acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities were less marked in patients who were shunted.\r"

Eleven septic controls received saline and LPS, three nonseptic controls received saline and WEB 2086, and three nonseptic controls received saline only. In six animals we investigated the effect of synthetic PAF in doses between 50 and 10,000 ng on arterial (AP) and pulmonary arterial (PAP) pressure before and during infusion of WEB 2086. The LPS-induced rise in PAP was reduced by WEB 2086 (p = 0.01) but not the decrease in AP. The LPS-induced leukopenia, hypoxia, increase in airway pressure, and release of plasminogen activator inhibitor were reduced by WEB 2086. Platelet activating factor produced an increase in PAP and a biphasic response in AP. All PAF dose response curves were shifted to the right by WEB 2086. Platelet activating factor was a pulmonary hypertensive agent and contributed to the LPS-induced respiratory alterations.\r"

Cerebral blood flow was varied by changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension and temperature. High-dose fentanyl-droperidol anesthesia and alpha-stat pH management were employed. To facilitate comparisons between the two methods, the individual awake values of middle cerebral artery flow velocity (45.1 +/- 3.3 cm/sec, mean +/- standard error of the mean) and jugular venous blood flow (382 +/- 37 ml/min) were normalized (100%). Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen was calculated as the product of jugular arteriovenous oxygen content difference and middle cerebral artery flow velocity or jugular venous blood flow, respectively. The individual correlations between the two flow estimates varied between 0.76 and 0.87 (median 0.83), and the correlation of the combined data from all seven patients was 0.77 (p less than 0.0001). Variations in arterial carbon dioxide tension induced significant changes in the two flow estimates both during normothermia before cardiopulmonary bypass and at deep hypothermia (20 degrees C) during cardiopulmonary bypass. The significant arterial carbon dioxide tension changes had no significant effects either on Doppler- or thermodilution-estimated cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen. Deep hypothermia (20 degrees C) reduced Doppler- and thermodilution-estimated cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen to 22.0% +/- 3.9% and 20.6% +/- 6.9% of the awake levels, respectively. The study supports the validity of using middle cerebral arterial flow velocity changes as an estimate of changes in volume flow through the brain during cardiac operations.\r"

NNV had been instituted in 26 patients with daytime hypercapnia and nocturnal hypoventilation due to neuromuscular diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After initiation of NNV, 21 of 26 patients continued to use this treatment regularly (81% compliance rate) and considered their life-style improved. In this subset of patients, the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide during unassisted breathing decreased from 64 +/- 13 to 51 +/- 7 mm Hg, and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen increased from 58 +/- 12 to 68 +/- 8 mm Hg. No significant change was noted in the forced vital capacity or maximal respiratory pressures. Four of the five patients in whom NNV had been discontinued cited discomfort related to the mask or severity and poor prognosis of the underlying illness as reasons for cessation of treatment. We conclude that NNV is well tolerated by most patients and may improve alveolar ventilation and arterial oxygenation in patients with chronic respiratory failure.\r"

Doses of 10 to 300 mg administered daily by intravenous infusion were well tolerated for up to 50 weeks, with no haematological or biochemical evidence of toxicity. Mean OKT4 cell count rose slightly during the second month of treatment when higher steady-state plasma concentrations of the drug were achieved. Median p24 antigen concentration fell by 41% during the first month of therapy. When the rise in p24 antigen before therapy was compared to the fall during treatment, end-point analysis showed a significant difference (p less than 0.03). The combination of potent antiretroviral activity in vitro and the observed effect on HIV p24 antigen and absence of toxicity in vivo indicate that R 82913 and related TIBO derivatives merit further study in the treatment of retroviral infections.\r"

We examined 45 subjects who were participating in a community center basketball league. Each subject was measured prior to the season for bilateral weight, quadricep girth, calf girth, Q-angle of the knee, dorsiflexion of the ankle, forefoot varus, rearfoot valgus, and true and apparent leg length. All lower extremity injuries causing a game to be missed were recorded during the 16-game season. Average values for bilateral weight, quadricep girth, Q-angle, rearfoot valgus, and leg length measures for the injured players were all larger than the average for the non-injured players by at least one standard deviation. A logistic regression equation using three of the variables correctly predicted the injury status of 91% of the players. The three-variable equation was then used prospectively to predict injury status for members of a small college basketball team. Only one player missed a game due to injury, and the equation identified that player as the most likely to be injured. This study demonstrates a strong relationship between structural measures and lower extremity injury in basketball players.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Liver disease is a frequent and major complication after organ transplantation. We sought to determine whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted by organ transplantation and whether it causes post-transplantation liver disease. METHODS. Serum samples from all cadaver organ donors to the New England Organ Bank between 1986 and 1990 were screened retrospectively for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We reviewed the hospital records of all recipients of organs from anti-HCV-positive donors for evidence of liver disease. Serum samples from recipients obtained before transplantation and during follow-up were analyzed for anti-HCV. RESULTS. Of 716 organ donors, 13 (1.8 percent) were positive for anti-HCV. Their organs (19 kidneys, 6 hearts, and 4 livers) went to 29 recipients. Non-A, non-B hepatitis developed after transplantation in 14 of the 29 (48 percent), for a prevalence 7.4 times the 6.5 percent prevalence after transplantation from untested donors that was previously reported by two institutions in the organ bank (P less than 0.0001). The liver disease began a mean of 3.8 months after transplantation and became chronic in 12 patients; the other 2 had subfulminant hepatic failure. Liver disease was more frequent in the patients who had received antilymphocyte preparations (P = 0.04). HCV was the cause of the post-transplantation liver disease in 12 of the 13 recipients (92 percent) for whom serum samples were available. Anti-HCV was detected by ELISA in eight and enzyme immunoassay in one; in three others, HCV RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in serum samples obtained after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS. Organ transplantation can transmit hepatitis C. This raises serious questions about the continued acceptance of organs from donors positive for anti-HCV.\r"

There are many pathways in which malnutrition causes a propensity for infection, and these have been discussed. Meeting the patient's nutritional needs should avoid some of the complications of infections in orthopedic surgery.\r"

Death occurred in 2.8% patients, 6.7% were severely damaged and 90.5% were cured with no or only minor sequelae. The risk of death or severe damage in patients less than 1 year of age was 5.0-fold (95% confidence limits, 2.2 to 11.6; P less than 0.001) greater than that of older children. When compared with those children whose level of consciousness had been normal before admission, children who had been disoriented before admission had a 3.9-fold (1.1 to 14.3, P less than 0.05) risk and those who had been unconscious had a 25.4-fold (7.3 to 88.1, P less than 0.001) greater risk of death or severe damage. The risk of death or severe damage in patients with herpes simplex virus encephalitis was 11.7-fold (3.8 to 35.8, P less than 0.001) and in patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis it was 7.0-fold (2.6 to 18.7, P less than 0.001) that of other children. All patients with none of the above mentioned risk factors were cured without any major sequelae. We conclude that specific attention should be paid to the youngest patients, especially to those with an impaired level of consciousness, and all available measures should be focused on early detection of herpes simplex virus or M. pneumoniae infection.\r"

In addition serum IL-1 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis than in asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients. Children with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis had the highest serum TNF-alpha and IL-1 concentrations. Among symptomatic children serum TNF-alpha concentrations correlated positively with those of IL-1, and both were inversely related to the amount of p24 antigen. TNF-alpha values in excess of 50 pg/ml were observed more frequently among patients with CD4+ cell count greater than 400/mm3 than in those with CD4+ cell count less than 400/mm3.

For food-limited populations, mortality was compensatory or depensatory; emerging adults were as or more abundant with higher average fitness than those from uninfected control populations. When nutrients were scarce, parasitic infections relaxed larval competition and increased per capita food by reducing host abundance. Food limitation altered larval feeding behavior, reducing horizontal transmission and subsequent mortality from parasitism.\r"

Compared to saline controls, both the aspirin-only and the tissue plasminogen activator-plus-aspirin groups had a significantly higher incidence of cerebral hemorrhage, whereas the heparin and tissue plasminogen activator combination groups did not.

Recent in vitro studies suggest that there may be a mutual interaction between these two mediators. We explored the relation between oxygen free radicals and excitatory amino acids in the development of ischemic brain edema in vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with the free radical scavenger dimethylthiourea 1 hour before ischemia or with the excitotoxin antagonist MK-801 30 minutes before ischemia produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Groups of seven or eight animals were treated with vehicle, low-dose (375 mg/kg) dimethylthiourea, high-dose (750 mg/kg) dimethylthiourea, low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) MK-801, high-dose (2.0 mg/kg) MK-801, or both high-dose dimethylthiourea and low-dose MK-801. After 4 hours of ischemia, brain water content was determined. In eight vehicle-treated controls, mean +/- SEM water content of tissue in the center of the ischemic zone was 83.29 +/- 0.18%. A significant reduction of brain edema was observed in all drug-treated groups: for example, 50.2% (p less than 0.001) in the high-dose dimethylthiourea group, 53.7% (p less than 0.001) in the low-dose MK-801 group, and 66.4% (p less than 0.001) in the combined dimethylthiourea and MK-801 group. Combined treatment with dimethylthiourea and MK-801 provided no significant additive effect over that resulting from treatment with MK-801 alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To explore how red cell transfusions were used to support patients who underwent primary and revision hip and knee replacements classified within diagnosis-related group (DRG) 209 (major joint and limb reattachment procedures), we studied abstracted patient discharge records from 151 United States hospitals in 1986. A total of 9684 units of whole blood and/or separated red cells was used to support 6472 patients. The transfusion use varied by surgical procedure, with patient gender as an influencing factor. Large proportions of patients underwent surgery without requiring transfusion. Among transfused patients, the majority received 1 to 3 units of red cells; however, a minority of patients required multiple transfusions, thereby utilizing a disproportionate share of the blood resource. Comparison of transfusion practice within the seven most active hospitals revealed significant differences (p less than or equal to 0.01) in the percentage of patients actually transfused, but not in the mean number of units of red cell components transfused per transfused patient. Similar findings emerged from comparison of transfusion practice when all hospitals were segregated into five hospital classes on the basis of orthopedic surgical service activity. These effects were seen for both total knee and total hip replacement procedures. It can be concluded that the lack of clearly defined criteria for transfusion contributed to the variations observed.\r"

  ".U": "91306834\r", 
  ".W": "Biliary tree diverticula and webs are considered by several authors to be specific cholangiographic features of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Our experience suggested that these findings can be seen in patients without PSC. The purpose of this study was twofold: to establish whether diverticula and webs are indeed specific for PSC and to assess whether PSC can be accurately diagnosed without reference to diverticula or webs. We retrospectively reviewed 861 consecutive ERCP studies and found 32 cases of webs and/or diverticula. Using accepted cholangiographic, clinical, and histologic criteria, we diagnosed PSC in nine patients and excluded it in 21, with two instances of uncertain diagnoses. Webs and diverticula seen in PSC were cholangiographically indistinguishable from those in the group without PSC. All 21 patients without PSC had other biliary abnormalities, and were grouped by the predominant abnormality or finding believed to be associated with diverticulum or web formation: common duct stones or cholangitis (n = 11 patients), postoperative stricture (n = 4), bile duct stent and balloon dilatation (n = 3), malignant stricture (n = 2), and choledochoduodenostomy (n = 1). To assess cholangiographic diagnosis of PSC in these patients, a blinded reviewer studied the radiographs of the 30 patients with diverticula and/or webs who had confirmed diagnoses. By using established radiologic criteria alone (ignoring diverticula and webs), the correct diagnosis was made in 27, yielding a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 91%. We conclude that the presence of diverticula and/or webs on a cholangiogram is a nonspecific finding and may be due to inflammation or trauma to the bile duct wall. Further, PSC can be distinguished from other abnormalities on the basis of findings other than diverticula and webs.\r"

Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 antigen levels showed a significant decrease in both groups of pregnant women (normotensive or preeclamptic) with intrauterine growth retardation when compared with pregnancies without intrauterine growth retardation.

Mammalian placentas are a rich source of epidermal growth factor receptors, but the role of epidermal growth factor in placental pathophysiologic conditions is unclear. To determine whether epidermal growth factor could affect mechanisms of placental transfer, we used an in situ rat placental perfusion model. Fourteen Sprague-Dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant were randomized to epidermal growth factor or placebo during placental transport experiments. We chose ethylenediaminetetraacetate tagged with chromium 51 as a marker of placental permeability. Epidermal growth factor treatment led to a dramatic increase of maternofetal clearances of chromium 51-ethylenediaminetetraacetate. We conclude that maternally administered epidermal growth factor has a potent action on placental permeability.\r"

  ".U": "91306929\r", 
  ".W": "A direct adverse effect of clomiphene citrate on the endometrium has been presumed, and interference with estrogen receptor-mediated endometrial estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor induction has been implicated as the mechanism responsible for an increased incidence of luteal phase deficiency in association with clomiphene citrate treatment. To clarify the net influence of clomiphene administration on endometrial steroid receptor induction, we studied five normal ovulatory women, in both a spontaneous and clomiphene-induced (150 mg/day, cycle days 5 to 9) ovulatory cycle. From cycle day 11 blood samples were obtained daily and urinary luteinizing hormone determinations were performed twice daily. Endometrial biopsy was performed on the day of the urinary luteinizing hormone surge and again 13 days after the surge. Serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were determined by immunoradiometric assay, estradiol and progesterone by radioimmunoassay, and clomiphene citrate isomer concentrations in treatment cycles by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection. Total, cytosolic, and salt-extracted nuclear endometrial estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Serum estradiol was threefold to fivefold higher (p less than 0.05) in clomiphene-induced than in spontaneous cycles 8 and 10 days before the luteinizing hormone surge, and progesterone was increased (p less than 0.05) from the day of the surge to end of the cycle. Serum enclomiphene rose to plateau between 12 and 6 days before the luteinizing hormone surge (4.1 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, mean +/- SE, n = 19) and fell thereafter to less than 1.0 ng/ml. Zuclomiphene levels increased rapidly between 14 and 8 days before the surge (53.9 +/- 2.8 ng/ml, mean +/- SE, n = 5) and then decreased gradually but remained elevated throughout the luteal phase (29.0 +/- 1.2 ng/ml, mean +/- SE, n = 33). Late luteal endometrial histology was abnormal in one of four available treatment cycle specimens, but the endocrine characteristics and number and subcellular distribution of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in the abnormal cycle were not different from those of normal, in-phase cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The TCR delta gene was rearranged in four lymphomas although the gamma/delta TCR was not expressed in two cases studied. The TCR delta gene was the only TCR gene rearranged in two cases. Each lymphoma with TCR delta gene rearrangement had an aberrant T-cell immunophenotype and three cases were of the large cell anaplastic type. The TCR delta gene was deleted in 22 cases and was in the germline configuration in 13 lymphomas. Deletion of the TCR delta gene was characteristic of mycosis fungoides, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus positive), and Lennert's lymphoma, and was not identified in angiocentric lymphomas. In eight cases with TCR delta deletion, however, a large number of polyclonal (presumably reactive) T cells were present and, in these lymphomas, the authors could not determine if TCR delta gene deletion occurred in the polyclonal T cells, the neoplastic cells, or both cell populations. The authors conclude that the TCR delta gene is usually deleted in mature T-cell lymphomas, as would be expected in alpha/beta TCR T cells. However, TCR delta gene rearrangement is detectable in approximately 10% of cases. Analysis of this locus may be useful diagnostically, as it occasionally may be the only molecular marker of clonality in mature T-cell lymphomas T-cell receptor delta chain gene rearrangement also is found most often in lymphomas of the large cell anaplastic type.\r"

  ".W": "A possible etiologic role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in Hodgkin's disease (HD) was investigated by probing for EBV genome in 52 biopsy specimens involved with HD and 43 hyperplastic lymph node specimens. Using dot-blot hybridization (Bam HIW probe), Southern blot hybridization (Xho I probe), and polymerase chain reaction analyses, 27%, 27%, and 58% of the nodes with HD were positive for EBV genome, respectively, as compared to 16%, 14%, and 43% in the hyperplastic lymph nodes. Clonal and nonclonal episomal EBV and linear replicating EBV genome were present in both conditions. Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements were found in two clonal and two nonclonal EBV-positive HD cases, but not in the lymphoid hyperplasia cases. These findings and other recent reports showing EBV genome in benign lymphoid cells by in situ hybridization in Hodgkin's disease suggest that the characteristics of EBV infection in HD could be explained by the reactive cellular milieu, especially in the setting of defective immunity. The identification of EBV genome in Reed-Sternberg cells may, therefore, be a nonspecific phenomenon.\r"

No tumor-promoting regimens were used, and the animals were fed only laboratory chou. The R16 males developed liver cancer and the R16 females developed breast cancer, there also were malignancies in other organs in some animals. By contrast, the ACP males did not develop any malignancies, and the ACP females had a significantly lower prevalence of malignant tumors. Thus the susceptibility to cancer in these two strains of rats has a genetic basis associated with genes in the grc region, and is independent of the carcinogen used, the action of a promoter, and the sex of the animals.\r"

  ".W": "A subset of demented elderly patients exhibit large numbers of cortical intraneuronal inclusions similar to the neurofilament (NF)-rich Lewy bodies (LB) found in pigmented subcortical neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Because these cortical inclusions may contribute to the emergence of cognitive impairments in afflicted individuals, the authors mapped the distribution of NF epitopes in these so-called cortical LBs. This was done using ethanol-fixed tissues and a large library of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with well-characterized binding specificities to various regions of each NF triplet protein. Cortical LBs were examined by light, confocal, and electron microscopy, and they were compared with the subcortical LBs of PD and LBs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the rod regions of each of the three NF subunits, or for phosphate-dependent and independent antigenic sites in the tail region of the high- (NF-H) and middle- (NF-M) molecular weight (Mr) NF subunits as well as other MAbs to the extreme COOH terminus of NF-L and NF-M or the head region of NF-M labeled a variable number of cortical LBs. Remarkably one of these anti-NF MAbs, RMO32, which recognized a phosphorylated epitope in the tail region of NF-M, immunolabeled nearly all cortical LBs, whereas each of the other anti-NF MAbs never labeled more than 10% of ubiquitin- or RMO32-positive cortical LBs. Further LBs in the PNS resembled those in the central nervous system (CNS) in their immunologic properties, and LBs in both sites were dominated by filamentous aggregates at the ultrastructural level. These findings suggest that NF proteins are profoundly altered during their incorporation into cortical and PNS LBs. Further the authors here identified immunologic and ultrastructural properties common to cortical LBs, PNS LBs, and classic substantia nigra LBs in PD. The accumulation of filamentous, perikaryal inclusions rich in NF proteins at diverse sites in the CNS and PNS of patients with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders suggests a widespread disruption of NF metabolism or transport.\r"

DESIGN: Prospectively identified incidence (cohort) study. SETTING: Air medical service of tertiary-care teaching hospital. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-five consecutive AMI patients transported within 12 hours of the initiation of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator were compared with 119 nontransported AMI patients treated in a similar manner. RESULTS: The transported and nontransported populations were similar with regard to age, sex, and infarct location. Transport was well tolerated with no episodes of cardiac arrest or cardioversion occurring during transport. Hypotension requiring fluids or increased pressors occurred in 18 patients. Bleeding complications of all types occurred in 43.2% of the transported and 49.6% of the nontransported patients, respectively (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.17). CONCLUSION: Helicopter transport of AMI patients after initiation of thrombolysis appears to be safe acutely and without a clinically significant increase in risk of bleeding complications through hospital discharge when accomplished by a highly skilled team.\r"

DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Hospitals participating in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II trial (TIMI II). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received rt-PA, heparin, and aspirin. The total dose of rt-PA was 150 mg for the first 520 patients and 100 mg for the remaining 2819 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to an invasive strategy (coronary arteriography with percutaneous angioplasty [if feasible] done routinely 18 to 48 hours after the start of thrombolytic therapy) or to a conservative strategy (coronary arteriography done for recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia). Eligible patients were also randomly assigned to either immediate intravenous or deferred beta-blocker therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were monitored for hemorrhagic events during hospitalization. MAIN RESULTS: In patients on the 100-mg rt-PA regimen, major and minor hemorrhagic events were more common among those assigned to the invasive than among those assigned to the conservative strategy (18.5% versus 12.8%, P less than 0.001). Major or minor hemorrhagic events were associated with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown, peak rt-PA levels, thrombocytopenia, prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to more than 90 seconds, weight of 70 kg or less, female gender, and physical signs of cardiac decompensation. Immediate intravenous beta-blocker therapy had no important effect on hemorrhagic events when compared with delayed beta-blocker therapy. Intracranial hemorrhages were more frequent among patients treated with the 150-mg rt-PA dose than with the 100-mg rt-PA dose (2.1% versus 0.5%, P less than 0.001). The extent of the plasmin-mediated hemostatic defect was also greater in patients receiving the 150-mg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Increased morbidity due to hemorrhagic complications is associated with an invasive management strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Our findings show the complex interaction of several factors in the occurrence of hemorrhagic events during thrombolytic therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91307267\r", 
  ".W": "A chromosomal gentamicin resistance determinant from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cloned on a 2.4-kb fragment in the broad-host-range vector pLAFR3. Substrate profiles for eight aminoglycosides at three concentrations showed that resistance was due to aminoglycoside-(3)-N-acetyltransferase III. This enzyme was produced in Pseudomonas strains but not in an Escherichia coli strain bearing the aacC3 gene. Nucleotide sequencing revealed two contiguous open reading frames (ORFs) preceded by a potential promoter and a ribosome-binding site. ORF-1 was 642 bp in length and encoded a protein of unknown function with a molecular mass of 23.9 kDa. ORF-2 was 813 bp in length and encoded a protein of 29.6 kDa. From deletion mutagenesis, in vitro transcription-translation data, and protein analysis of bacterial lysates, it was inferred that this 29.6-kDa protein represents the aminoglycoside-(3)-N-acetyltransferase III enzyme. A polymerase chain reaction with two specific intragenic 20-mer primers was developed to detect the aacC3 gene. A BstEII restriction site in the amplified DNA region was used to demonstrate the specificity of the reaction. Tests of 23 reference strains, which produced 12 different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, confirmed the specificities of the primers. The gene proved to be absent from a collection of 50 gentamicin-resistant P. aeruginosa strains selected at random in The Netherlands.\r"

  ".W": "Ro 23-9424 is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent consisting of a cephalosporin (desacetylcefotaxime) linked through an ester bond to a fluoroquinolone (fleroxacin). Its activity against mutants of Escherichia coli TE18 resistant to both antibacterial components was examined. E. coli TE18 overproduces the AmpC beta-lactamase and is resistant to several cephalosporins, including desacetylcefotaxime (MIC, 50 micrograms/ml), although it is still susceptible to Ro 23-9424 (MIC, 0.2 microgram/ml). Thirty-five spontaneous, two-step mutants of E. coli TE18 which were resistant to fleroxacin (MIC, 50 micrograms/ml) were isolated. In the mutants, replicative DNA biosynthesis (permeabilized cells) was resistant to fleroxacin, and some mutants had porin abnormalities. However, all remained susceptible to Ro 23-9424 (MIC, 0.5 microgram/ml). Examination of beta-lactamase activity in the parent strain revealed that it hydrolyzes desacetylcefotaxime more rapidly than it does Ro 23-9424. Thus, Ro 23-9424 may be less susceptible to the gram-negative, chromosomal beta-lactamases that hydrolyze several broad-spectrum cephalosporins and may be effective in cases in which neither of its two components is active.\r"

  ".W": "The accepted model for the penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics into gram-negative bacteria is that proposed by Zimmermann and Rosselet (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 12:368-372, 1977). The model assumes (i) that diffusion of the antibiotic molecules across the outer membrane obeys Fick's law and can be characterized by a permeability constant for any given combination of organism and drug, (ii) that drug hydrolysis within the periplasm obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and (iii) that a steady state is rapidly attained between drug uptake and hydrolysis. The model has allowed accurate prediction of antibiotic MICs for Escherichia coli strains from a knowledge of their beta-lactamase production and permeability characteristics. It has been suggested that the model is inappropriate for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but attempts to confirm this have been bedevilled by experimental difficulties in estimating permeability coefficients for this species. In the present study, we tested a prediction of the model that the overall resistance of P. aeruginosa transconjugants containing a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase should continue to depend partly on permeability. Transconjugants with PSE-4 beta-lactamase were constructed in host strains with widely different levels of intrinsic, presumably impermeability-determined resistance. Contrary to the prediction of the model, all the transconjugants developed identical overall levels of resistance to substrate beta-lactams, such as azlocillin and cefoperazone, irrespective of the initial levels of intrinsic resistance of the recipient strains. We conclude that the model is inappropriate for P. aeruginosa, and possible explanations for the organism's behavior are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with those of tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin against 730 bacterial isolates representing 49 different species. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin had similar spectra of activity, but sparfloxacin was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and more active against many gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. Tosufloxacin MICs were generally 8- to 16-fold lower than those for sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. All four fluoroquinolones were active against nalidixic acid-susceptible strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC for 90% of the isolates [MIC90], less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml) but nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible (MIC90, greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, MIC90s were 1.0 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 2.0 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 4.0 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin. Against Enterococcus faecalis, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin MIC90s were 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were 0.016 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 0.06 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin, and 0.5 micrograms/ml for both ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin. With four species of gram-negative bacilli, mutants resistant to two to four times the sparfloxacin MIC occurred spontaneously at frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-9): single-step high-level resistance was not observed. In vitro-selected sparfloxacin-resistant mutants displayed cross-resistance to other quinolones, as did clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus. Tosufloxacin MICs with broth microdilution methods were four- to eightfold greater than those obtained with agar dilution methods. The two procedures gave comparable results when sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin was being tested.\r"

Improved care has increased survival in patients with short-bowel syndrome, but the quality-of-life factors associated with such improved survival have not been examined, to our knowledge. Sixteen consecutive pediatric patients with short-bowel syndrome (bowel length range, 22 to 98 cm) were followed up for 2 to 10 years. The original diagnoses were as follows: necrotizing enterocolitis (n = 6), multiple intestinal atresias (n = 4), extensive aganglionosis (n = 2), meconium peritonitis (n = 2), and midgut volvulus (n = 2). The range of initial hospitalization was from 62 to 395 days, and 13 of 16 patients have required readmission (two to 14 times). All patients required multiple operations (range, two to 14 operations), including combinations of venous access, adhesiolysis, tapering enteroplasty, reversed intestinal segments, and pull-through procedure. Nine of 16 patients received home total parenteral nutrition, and 12 of 16 patients required home elemental diets, usually via pump feedings. Fifteen patients (94%) survived. Two survivors are deaf, and one of these has mild developmental delay. Seven survivors (age range, 6 to 10 years) attend a regular school, four while receiving total parenteral nutrition or an elemental diet. Ten of 15 survivors are off all nutritional support (including the child with a 22-cm small bowel), with four others weaning. The presence or absence of an ileocecal valve did not affect outcome. Modern nutritional support methods provide excellent survival and quality of life for children with short-bowel syndrome.\r"

Blood was also obtained predialysis and again immediately postdialysis from seven patients (five of whom also participated in the chronic study). As expected, the patients manifested a high anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis. Serum SO4 was only moderately stable from month to month (the average coefficient of variation was 0.30; correlation between the serum SO4 value of month one and months two and five were r = 0.59, p = 0.026; and r = 0.38, p = 0.182, respectively). The ratio of mean serum SO4 to mean AG (5.0 +/- 0.4 [SE] mEq/L divided by 19.1 +/- 0.5 mEq/L) was 0.26. Although there was a statistically significant correlation between the serum SO4 and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN), there was no such correlation between SO4 and AG. A single hemodialysis reduced serum SO4 by 54% (from 3.5 +/- 0.5 mEq/L to 1.6 +/- 0.1 mEq/L), but there was no correlation between the change in SO4 and the change in AG. The authors concluded that SO4 contributes importantly to the elevated AG in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis. Single pass bicarbonate hemodialysis temporarily reduces, but does not normalize, both the serum SO4 and the AG of such patients.\r"

  ".W": "To determine trends in a variety of dialysis-associated diseases and practices, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 1,867 chronic hemodialysis centers in the United States in 1989 in conjunction with the annual facility survey performed by the Health Care Financing Administration. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 92%. These 1,726 centers represented 122,734 patients and 32,486 staff members. The following results were found. 1) During the last 14 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.1% among patients, and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.4% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 92% of the centers. By the end of 1989, 19% of susceptible patients and 55% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1989, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) increased from 12 to 19% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989 was reported to be 0.7% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. 2) Twenty-two percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients, and 51% reported septicemia. 3) The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 23%. 4) In 1989, 68% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 73% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 1 to 50 (mean, 12) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was ever reused ranged from 3 to 150 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde, Renalin (a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide), and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were reported more frequently in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was associated only with centers that used Renalin or glutaraldehyde for reprocessing (not formaldehyde) and occurred with both automated and manual reprocessing systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN--Study of hypertensive patients having electrolyte concentrations measured, including 137Cs. Interview by questionnaire of island subjects about intake of foods likely to contain radiocaesium and the source of these foods. Measurement of 137Cs and 134Cs in food, urine, and vegetation. SETTING--Scottish mainland and Western Isles, 1979-86. All measurements before Chernobyl nuclear accident. PATIENTS--413 consecutive patients referred to the blood pressure unit for investigation of hypertension. 60 from the Western Isles, including 44 from North Uist; 32 from North Uist participated in the dietary analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Concentration of radiocaesium in the body, urine, food, and vegetation. Islanders' consumption of local produce. RESULTS--Patients from the Western Isles had five times higher body concentrations of 137Cs (median 2.54 (interquartile range 1.25-3.73)) Bq/gK) than did patients from around Glasgow (0.47 (0.26-0.66) Bq/gK) and other parts of the Scottish mainland (0.42 (0.24-0.71) Bq/gK). Islanders often consumed local milk and mutton, but ate local fish rarely. 137Cs and 134Cs were present in coastal (21.6 Bq/kg 137Cs, 0.25 Bq/kg 134Cs) and moorland (135.9, 0.65 Bq/kg) grasses and in islanders' urine (2.01, 0.013 Bq/l). Lower concentrations (0.336, 0.004 Bq/l), were found in the urine of Glasgow controls (p less than 0.001 for both isotopes). CONCLUSIONS--Islanders have excess body 137Cs concentrations, most of which probably comes from local milk and lamb. The radioactivity is not above the recommended safety limit. The presence of 134Cs suggests that nuclear reprocessing is the source of some of the radiocaesium.\r"

They also studied these cases using various monoclonal antibodies. Of the 23 examined cases, nine were negative for both heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins; the authors defined these as common ALL. Two cases were positive for the mu chain but were negative for light chains; the authors defined these as pre-B-cell ALL. The remaining 12 cases were positive for either kappa or lambda light chains; these were defined as B-cell ALL. Of the 12 cases positive for light chains, 11 were positive for the lambda chain. Seven cases of the 11 positive cases for the lambda chain were negative for heavy chains. Eleven cases were positive either for both My4 and My9 or for one of the two antibodies. From these results, the authors conclude the following: (1) the ratio of pre-B-cell ALL among non-T-cell ALL cases (two of 23 cases) was lower in adults than in children; (2) of the light chain-positive cases, the lambda light chain-positive cases predominated (11 of 12 cases); (3) heavy chain-negative, lambda chain-positive cases (seven cases) were observed; and (4) one half of the leukemia cases showed dual phenotypes of B-cell and myeloid cell lineages.\r"

Quantitative measurements documented glandular changes in an even greater percentage of cases. Although distinctive, the histologic pattern was not specific for leuprolide/flutamide. The absence of appreciable degeneration and necrosis in tumor cells suggests that this type of androgen deprivation may act through suppression rather than ablation of prostatic cancers. The relationship between treatment-related histologic effects and initial tumor grade and clinical stage as well as expression of prostate-specific antigen was studied. Accurate histologic assessment of leuprolide/flutamide-treated prostate glands should not be a problem so long as specimens are thoroughly examined and drug-related variations in tumor morphologic features are appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "A 65-year-old man was evaluated for pancytopenia in March 1979, and found to have hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Treatment with splenectomy and subsequently interferon produced temporary remissions. In July 1985, the patient began intravenous deoxycoformycin (DCF) therapy, and after 1 year complete peripheral blood and bone marrow remission was achieved. Fourteen months after cessation of therapy, the patient developed a skin rash and was found to have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and Sezary syndrome. Morphologic study of the hairy cells (HC) in the peripheral blood at presentation and the Sezary cells was distinct by light and electron microscopic study. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed clearly that the HC were of B-cell origin (CD20+, sIg+), whereas the lymphoid population at second presentation was T-cell (CD3+, CD4+, HLA-DR-). Clonal rearrangement of T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain gene was detected by Southern analysis of the Sezary cell population, whereas immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes remained in germ line configuration. This is the first case of Sezary syndrome developing in a patient previously treated for HCL where studies have confirmed distinct B-cell and T-cell origin of the two neoplasms. The authors suggest that treatment and disease-related immunosuppression are possible etiologic factors in the development of this second lymphoid neoplasm.\r"

Each patient had one or more paraneoplastic complications: severe rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and secondary renal failure, cutaneous vasculitis, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, polyserositis, and increased macrophages with hemophagocytic activity. They did not have peripheral lymphadenopathy. The complex clinical presentations simulated collagen vascular disorders, systemic infections, or severe liver disease rather than a malignant lymphoma. Routine histologic studies revealed a small population of lymphoma cells in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver. Immunophenotyping studies demonstrated their T-cell phenotype, and cytogenetic analysis showed the clonality in Patients 1 and 2; clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was found in Patients 2 and 3. These studies should be considered in the evaluation of patients with constitutional symptoms, liver failure, coagulopathy, and pancytopenia even in the absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy.\r"

  ".W": "In renal exploratory excisions the isoenzyme C of the carbonic anhydrase was detected in 51 operative treated patients with recurrent urolithiasis and in 6 patients with ren mobilis or stenosis of the ureteral pelvic junction by using the immunohistochemical PAP-method. In the distal tubules and collecting ducts there is an alternating occurrence of cells with small and those with strong reactivity. This correlates with the distribution of mean or principal (P-, small reaction) and intercalated (I-, strong reaction) cells. The number of carbonic anhydrase rich cells and the degree of their cytoplasmic reaction to this enzyme seem to correlate with the ability of the urine to acidify. The patients were divided into four groups according to the mean urine pH estimated for a period of two weeks. The third group with predominantly acid urine (pH less than 5.8) showed a significantly increased number of carbonic anhydrase rich cells (mean = 63% +/- 6, n = 18) as compared to the first group (controls) without urolithiasis and normal urine (pH 5.8-6.8, mean = 46% +/- 8, n = 6) or the second group with urolithiasis and normal urine (pH 5.8-6.8, mean = 46% +/- 8, n = 28). The fourth group with predominant alkaline urine (pH greater than 6.8) showed a significantly decreased number of intercalated cells (mean = 42% +/- 16, n = 5) in comparison to the third group. Indeed, the difference with the control group is not significant but the cytoplasmic reaction of I-cells decreases distinctly in comparison to all other groups.\r"

The profile of these vasoactive hormones and their relationships with hemodynamic indices in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), however, are not clear. We therefore measured plasma concentrations of ANP, PRA, ET, together with parathyroid hormone (PTH) in 17 patients (mean age 38.5 years) on maintenance CAPD over a period of 12 weeks. Baseline ANP, PRA, and ET levels were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects, and no significant changes in these indices were observed over the 12 week period. There was a significant positive correlation between levels of plasma ANP and PRA [rank correlation coefficient, R(s) = 0.496, p less than 0.05] as has been reported in cardiac failure. Despite the absence of clinically overt heart failure, a significant proportion (approximately 50%) of our patients demonstrated evidence of myocardial dysfunction on echocardiography. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was demonstrated between plasma ANP and left atrial size [R(s) = 0.61, p less than 0.01] and an inverse correlation existed between plasma ANP and the left ventricular ejection fraction [R(s) = 0.51, p less than 0.05]. Twelve patients (71%) had biochemical evidence of hyperparathyroidism with raised levels of serum PTH. Our study demonstrates increased levels of plasma ANP, PRA, and ET in uremic patients on long-term CAPD. A positive correlation exists between plasma ANP and PRA suggesting their myocardial function may be compromised and this was confirmed on echocardiography. The possibility that high circulating PTH concentrations contribute to impaired cardiac function in such patients, deserves further study.\r"

A total of 697 blood samples were collected at any time after the morning dose from 252 patients who had received oral doses of isradipine. Three approaches of data analysis based on exploratory (graphical and statistical) techniques were used to relate plasma level to patient demographic data and laboratory parameters. The pharamacokinetics of isradipine seemed to be influenced by the demographic variables of age (already detected in conventional studies) and weight, as well as by the blood serum levels of inorganic phosphorous, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, but only to a small, clinically irrelevant extent. The findings from the three approaches were complementary. They suggest that a pharmacokinetic screening in clinical trials is feasible at reasonable experimental cost and effort and provides useful data on interindividual and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variability in patients.\r"

The ability of plasma to inhibit a human renal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase showed an inverse correlation with cardiac index and a direct correlation with peripheral resistance.

The possible natriuretic and kaliuretic effects of a single dose of lithium, as used in lithium clearance studies, were investigated in 15 healthy subjects on fixed sodium (100 mmol/24 h) and potassium (70 mmol/24 h) intakes. Lithium carbonate (300 mg or 600 mg) or placebo tablets were administered, double-blind and in random order, midway through a 48 h urine collection (divided into six 8 h periods), at 23.00 hours. 2. During the three 24 h periods which preceded the administration of lithium or placebo (control days), rates of sodium and potassium excretion followed normal circadian patterns, but no differences in excretion rates between the 3 control days were observed. Placebo tablets did not affect excretion rates. 3. After the 300 mg dose of lithium carbonate, 24 h sodium excretion increased by approximately 17 mmol (P less than 0.05); almost all of the natriuretic effect occurred during the first two 8 h periods. No effect on potassium excretion was observed. 4. After the 600 mg dose of lithium carbonate, 24 h sodium excretion increased by approximately 48 mmol (P less than 0.001) and 24 h potassium excretion increased by approximately 19 mmol (P less than 0.01). These effects were confined to the first two 8 h periods and thus occurred before and during the usual lithium clearance period. 5. Plasma renin activity, measured in 10 subjects, increased after the 600 mg dose of lithium carbonate (P less than 0.005), but plasma concentrations of aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide were not significantly affected. Neither the 300 mg dose of lithium carbonate nor the placebo tablets affected hormone levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine pituitary gonadotropin secretion and responsiveness to GnRH after photic-induced changes in reproductive condition, an in vitro pituitary perifusion system was established for male golden hamster tissue. Anterior pituitaries from adult males which had been maintained on 14 h light:10 h dark (long days) or 6 h light:18 h dark (short days) for 10 weeks were perifused using an Acusyst perifusion system. Perfusates from unstimulated tissue (basal secretion) and from tissue stimulated with hourly pulses of GnRH (25, 50, or 100 ng/ml) were assayed for LH and FSH by RIA. Tissue from short-day animals had lower basal LH secretion than tissue from long day animals, but there were no significant photoperiodic differences for GnRH-stimulated LH secretion. In contrast, there were no photoperiodic differences in basal FSH secretion, but tissue from short-day animals secreted more FSH than tissue from long-day animals when stimulated with GnRH. Bioactivity of a small number of perfusate samples was assessed using in vitro rat granulosa cell and mouse Leydig cell assays for FSH and LH, respectively, and did not show any photoperiodic differences in LH or FSH bioactivity for GnRH-stimulated tissue. These studies indicate that the pituitaries of gonadally regressed hamsters are capable in vitro of responding to GnRH with similar or greater levels of gonadotropin release compared to pituitaries from animals with functional gonads. Therefore, it appears that the lowered serum gonadotropin levels seen in vivo in gonadally regressed animals are not due to a reduction in intrinsic pituitary sensitivity to GnRH.\r"

  ".W": "Dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) inhibited the entry into the S-phase of quiescent chemically transformed mouse fibroblasts (BP-A31) stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl 13-acetate (TPA; a protein kinase-C activator) or with basic fibroblast growth factor. The basal rate of DNA synthesis was also strongly reduced by dexamethasone. In contrast, the mitogenic activity of insulin (acting via the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor) was little or not at all affected by dexamethasone. The antimitogenic activity of dexamethasone was enhanced when the steroid was included in the culture medium 24 h before the addition of mitogens. The effects of dexamethasone were glucocorticoid specific, partially reversed by the antiglucocorticoid RU 486, and prevented by cycloheximide (suggesting the involvement of glucocorticoid-induced protein synthesis in the antimitogenic activity of dexamethasone). Under the conditions of exponential growth in serum-free medium as well as in the presence of TPA, dexamethasone arrested the proliferation of sparsely seeded cells after a delay of 24-48 h. The BP-A31 cells are known to be constitutively competent and express at quiescence certain genes related to the G0/G1 transition in the original nontransformed A31 cell line. Of the transcripts corresponding to these genes, dexamethasone caused a rapid elimination of the JE mRNA, coding for a protein of the family of cytokines. The cell content of c-jun mRNA was also strongly reduced in the cells incubated at quiescence with dexamethasone (in the absence of mitogen). The presence of TPA along with dexamethasone prevented the elimination of c-jun, but not of JE mRNA. Short (30-min; together with the inducers) or long (24-h) treatment of the cells with dexamethasone did not prevent the induction of the c-fos gene expression by either TPA or basic fibroblast growth factor, indicating that dexamethasone does not interfere with mitogenic signal transduction. We conclude that in TPA-stimulated cells, the antiproliferative effect of dexamethasone is not due to interference with the expression of the c-jun gene, but may be related to the decreased level of the JE cytokine mRNA as well as to the synthesis of growth inhibitory protein(s).\r"

  ".W": "The presence of substance-P (SP)- and neuropeptide-Y (NPY)-like immunoreactivity was recently shown in nerves that innervate the ovary. In the present in vitro study we demonstrate that both peptides have direct effects on ovarian steroidogenesis. In cultured porcine granulosa (G-) cells, neither peptide affected progesterone (P) production under basal conditions, but they both inhibited gonadotropin-stimulated P secretion. In luteal (L-) cell cultures, basal as well as hCG-stimulated P release were dose-dependently inhibited by NPY (ED50, 4 x 10(-9) M; identical for both, basal and stimulated release), while SP had only a moderate inhibitory effect (ED50, 6 x 10(-8) M). In the presence of AP13, a specific SP antagonist, the inhibitory effect of SP on P release was abolished, which suggests a receptor-mediated effect. In addition, we determined androstenedione (A) and estradiol (E2) release into G- and L-cell culture media. While E2 production in G-cell cultures was not influenced by SP and NPY, both peptides had a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on E2 secretion by L-cells. In contrast to E2 release, A secretion by G- as well as L-cell cultures was increased by gonadotropins. Both SP and NPY decreased gonadotropin-stimulated A secretion by G- and L-cells under basal as well as hCG-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate SP immunoreactivity in media of G- and L-cell cultures with a HPLC retention time identical to that of synthetic SP. This may suggest ovarian synthesis, in which case the peptide exerts auto- and/or paracrine effects on ovarian steroidogenesis. From these in vitro results we suggest that SP and NPY have a modulatory effect on ovarian function in pigs not only by their well known regulatory effects of blood supply, but also by a direct effect on ovarian steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoneutralization of endogenous neuropeptide Y (NPY) with specific antibodies was used to evaluate the possible physiological role of this neuropeptide in the regulation of gonadotropin and PRL secretion in the mouse. Because regulation of anterior pituitary function can be profoundly altered by chronic GH excess, we felt it was also of interest to have examined the effects of immunoneutralization of NPY in transgenic mice expressing bovine (b) GH gene with mouse metallothionein-I promotor. Intact or castrated transgenic and normal (nontransgenic) littermate adult male mice were injected with control rabbit serum or anti-NPY rabbit serum (anti-NPY). Blood samples were obtained 24 h later for hormone measurements. In intact transgenic mice expressing bGH gene, plasma LH levels were reduced and plasma PRL levels were increased, as compared to their normal littermates. Plasma levels of FSH were similar in normal and transgenic animals. Injection of anti-NPY increased plasma LH levels significantly in both intact normal and intact transgenic mice. However, plasma levels of FSH and PRL were increased significantly after anti-NPY treatment only in intact normal mice. In both normal and transgenic males, castration lead to the expected increase in plasma FSH and LH levels, whereas plasma levels of PRL remained unaltered. Administration of anti-NPY to castrated animals was followed by a significant increase in circulating LH levels in both transgenic and normal mice, whereas plasma levels of PRL were not changed. The results suggest that NPY plays a physiological role in the control of gonadotropin and PRL release in the adult male mouse, and that expression of the bGH gene in transgenic mice is associated with altered role of endogenous NPY in the control of pituitary function.\r"

  ".U": "91309539\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that arginine vasopressin (AVP) possesses specific binding sites on rat adrenal glomerulosa cells and stimulates phosphoinositide breakdown and accumulation of inositol phosphates (IP) and diacylglycerol. Kinetic experiments also revealed that the production of IP declines rapidly under hormonal stimulation, even in the presence of Ca2+ in the external medium. In the present investigation, we studied the effects of a protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol ester (PDBu) on AVP-sensitive accumulation of IP. Experiments were conducted on glomerulosa cells cultured for 3 days. Results show that short term preincubation (5-10 min) with PDBu inhibits AVP-stimulated IP accumulation by 50% (ED50 = 2.6 +/- 0.9 nM). PKC most likely acts on the coupling between AVP receptor and the G-protein since PDBu reduces AVP-sensitive phospholipase C but does not alter either NaF-sensitive phospholipase C, AVP binding, or inositol lipid pools. However, after a 1- or 2-h preincubation with AVP or PDBu, a decrease in both IP accumulation and AVP binding capacity is observed. With regard to aldosterone secretion, PDBu alone stimulates hormone output, but when added simultaneously with AVP, it inhibits AVP-stimulated aldosterone secretion by 70%. If cells are allowed a resting period of 14 h after AVP or PDBu treatment, the AVP response (IP accumulation, AVP binding, and aldosterone output) is recovered and even enhanced. All these effects are specific since the inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha PDD is inactive, and staurosporine (a PKC inhibitor) reverses the PDBu effect. AVP stimulates transiently the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane, suggesting that the effect observed with PDBu reflects the effect of endogenous PKC stimulated by AVP. These results outline the complexities involved during hormonal stimulation and, at the same time, homologous desensitization phenomena. On one hand, acute treatment with PDBu--which induces PKC activation--is able to stimulate aldosterone secretion but at the same time initiate desensitization, since phorbol ester uncouples the AVP receptor from the coupling G protein. This suggests that PKC may participate in the first step of homologous desensitization. On the other hand, a 2-h incubation with PDBu induces a loss of AVP binding sites. This may represent the second step of homologous desensitization. Finally, a long term treatment with PDBu completely inactivates PKC, hence enabling AVP to further stimulate aldosterone secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined interactions between tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), a product of the immune system, and ovarian cells using serum-free monolayer cultures of untransformed swine granulosa cells. Recombinant human TNF alpha, a potent cytoactive product of activated macrophages, bound specifically and with high affinity to intact granulosa cells. Binding sites had an apparent Kd of 0.17 nM (95% confidence interval, 0.065-0.31), and a binding capacity of 80 nmol/micrograms DNA (95% confidence interval, 52-110). The binding capacity of granulosa cells for TNF alpha (but not the binding affinity) was increased approximately 2-fold by treatment with FSH and insulin. The biological effects of TNF alpha on pig granulosa cells were expressed after 48 and 96 h in culture. At the latter time, TNF alpha significantly suppressed insulin- and insulin- plus FSH-stimulated progesterone accumulation, with respective ID50 values of 0.08 +/- 0.008 and 0.06 +/- 0.014 nM, but did not affect basal progesterone accumulation or DNA content. TNF alpha also significantly attenuated the stimulatory effect of combined treatment with FSH and insulin on cAMP generation during 48-96 h of culture. TNF alpha inhibited the stimulatory effects of forskolin, cholera toxin, and the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP on progesterone accumulation, indicating multiple sites of action of this immune modulator. Inhibition of progestin biosynthesis was observed even in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol, a soluble oxygenated sterol substrate for the cholesterol side-chain cleavage reaction, and was accompanied by decreased concentrations of specific cellular mRNA encoding cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. There were no changes in the amounts of a constitutively expressed enzyme, phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase. Inhibitory actions of TNF alpha were specific to de novo steroid hormone biosynthesis, since nanomolar concentrations of this cytokine stimulated accumulation of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha basally and during treatment with FSH, cholera toxin, or 8-bromo-cAMP. In contrast, prostaglandin accumulation was not enhanced by interferon-gamma or interleukin-2. In summary, untransformed porcine granulosa cells exhibit specific, high affinity, low capacity saturable binding sites for TNF alpha, and the number of such binding sites can be regulated by combined treatment with insulin and FSH. Granulosa cells are susceptible to the inhibitory actions of TNF alpha on FSH- and insulin-supported progesterone biosynthesis and cAMP accumulation. One important locus of TNF alpha action is blockade of hormonally stimulated increases in specific mRNA encoding the cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Similarities in the molecular structure of these peptides suggest similar physiological function within the brain. This study examined the effects of centrally administered BNP and ANP on LH secretion in mature ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of 2 nmol ANP or BNP decreased mean plasma LH concentration and LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.05 for ANP; P less than 0.01 for BNP; n = 8/group) and frequency (P less than 0.01 for ANP and BNP). LH secretion was not affected by ANP or BNP at a lower concentration (0.2 nmol, icv; P greater than 0.05; n = 8/group). It was concluded that ANP and BNP may be involved in central regulation of LH secretion. Mechanisms possibly involved in suppression of LH secretion by ANP and BNP were also examined. OVX rats were treated with an opioid antagonist, naloxone (0.5 mg, iv), 45, 75, and 105 min after ANP or BNP (2 nmol, icv). Naloxone eliminated suppression of mean plasma LH concentration and LH pulse amplitude by 2 nmol ANP and BNP (P less than 0.05; n = 7/group). OVX rats were treated with a dopamine antagonist, pimozide (0.6 mg/kg, sc), 90 min before treatment with ANP or BNP (2 nmol, icv). Pimozide pretreatment blocked suppression of LH secretion by ANP or BNP (P less than 0.05; n = 9/group). Naloxone alone did not affect LH secretion (P greater than 0.05; n = 5). It was concluded that components of ANP and BNP suppression of LH secretion may depend upon opioid and dopamine activity.\r"

  ".U": "91309565\r", 
  ".W": "Follistatin is a glycosylated monomeric protein originally isolated from ovarian follicular fluid based on its ability to specifically inhibit pituitary FSH release. To further explore the physiological role of follistatin, we have expressed recombinant human follistatins with 315 (rhFS-315) and 288 (rhFS-288) amino acids in Chinese hamster ovary cells under the control of the simian virus-40 promoter. The two types of FS originated from alternatively spliced mRNAs and rhFS-315 differed from rhFS-288 by having an extra 27-amino acid sequence at the carboxyl-terminal. The yield of the purified rhFS-315 and rhFS-288 after a single step of affinity chromatography on an activin-coupled Affi-Gel column was 3-5 mg/liter conditioned medium. Using the rhFS-315 and rhFS-288 as molecular mass markers, Western blotting with FS carboxyl-terminal-specific antibodies demonstrated that the majority of native FS isolated from porcine ovarian follicular fluid was neither FS-315 nor FS-288, but was composed of 300 amino acids in various forms of glycosylation. This finding is consistent with our earlier results obtained from tryptic peptide fragment analysis of native FS. Only a very small percentage (less than 1%) of native porcine FS was FS-288. In cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells, rhFS-315 (ED50, 115.2 +/- 16.2 pM) is equipotent to native porcine FS (ED50, 86.7 +/- 14.1 pM) on the suppression of FSH release, but, surprisingly, rhFS-288 (ED50, 9.6 +/- 2.2 pM) is 8-10 times more potent than the native protein, similar to the potency of inhibin-A (ED50, 8.6 +/- 0.9 pM). Interestingly, when the in vivo FSH-suppressing activity of rhFS-288 was compared to that of inhibin-A in 1-week ovariectomized adult rats, it was found that rhFS-288 was more potent and longer acting than inhibin-A. Hence, these results indicate that FS-288 is probably one of the most potent natural FSH suppressors.\r"

In the present study we used a reverse hemolytic plaque assay to determine whether this effect was manifested as an augmentation of the number of PRL secretors and/or an increase in the amount of hormone released per PRL cell. Cultures of anterior pituitary (AP) and NIL cells from ovariectomized rats were cultured overnight, exposed to the treatment (E2 or vehicle) for 3 h, and then subjected to a reverse hemolytic plaque assay that was carried out in the presence or absence of TRH. Concurrent exposure of AP cells to E2 and NIL cells evoked an 11-12% increase in the overall proportion of PRL-secreting cells. This was true when the AP and NIL cells were incubated as a mixed culture and when the two cell types were maintained in the same petri dish but on separate plastic supports, and TRH did not significantly influence this response. The effect of E2 on the number of PRL secretors was negated when NIL cells were not present throughout the experiment or when they were removed from the cultures just before commencement of E2 treatment. Simultaneous treatment with E2 and NIL cells also significantly augmented the sizes of PRL plaques produced under basal conditions by AP cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that E2 stimulates NIL cells to release an activity that enhances PRL secretion in two ways: 1) by recruiting additional PRL cells into the secretory pool, and 2) by augmenting the secretory capacity of individual PRL cells.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous opioids stimulate PRL release in the rat during proestrus, stress, and lactation. This study investigated the potential role of opioids in regulating the daily nocturnal PRL surges that occur during the first half of pregnancy. On day 8 of pregnancy, infusion of naloxone (NAL; 0.25, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/10 min), an opioid receptor antagonist, from 0100-0400 h blocked the nocturnal surge in a dose-dependent manner. PRL remained at basal levels throughout the infusion when the highest dose of NAL was used. A PRL surge was still present in this group, but its delayed onset occurred 1 h after termination of the NAL infusion. In another experiment NAL was used to determine whether opioids are needed to maintain the nocturnal surge or only to initiate the surge. On day 8 of pregnancy, infusion of NAL (2.0 mg/10 min) was started at 0300 h, after initiation of the surge had occurred, and was continued until 0600 h. After 1 h of infusion, PRL levels were less than 20 ng/ml, compared to more than 200 ng/ml in controls (P less than 0.002) and remained low. A PRL surge occurred approximately 2-3 h after the infusion was discontinued, at a time when the surge was completed in controls (P less than 0.01). Experimental animals did not differ in their surges relative to controls on the next day when no infusion was given. Another set of experiments was performed to determine whether blockade of endogenous opioids inhibited the nocturnal PRL surge by stimulating tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons. Day 8 pregnant rats infused with NAL (2.0 mg/10 min) from 0100-0400 h demonstrated no nocturnal PRL surge. Subsequently, the medial basal hypothalamus in NAL-treated animals and saline controls was incubated in vitro with the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor brocresine (100 microM). The greater amount of resultant DOPA accumulation in the stalk median eminence of NAL-treated animals reflected increased TIDA neuronal activity compared to that in SAL-infused controls. Similar results were obtained when rats were treated in vivo with the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor NSD 1015 (25 mg/kg BW) just before termination of the NAL infusion. Based on these results, we conclude that endogenous opioid peptides are essential in initiating and maintaining nocturnal PRL surges in pregnant rats. Moreover, opioids appear to exert their effects by decreasing TIDA neuronal activity.\r"

This may be related to an ACTH-inducible adrenal microsomal cytochrome P450 that metabolizes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The proportions of major monooxygenated products of rat adrenal microsomal DMBA metabolism (DMBA-8,9-diol, DMBA-3,4-diol, and DMBA-phenols) differ significantly from that of P450IA1, the most active PAH-metabolizing P450 in rat liver microsomes. After hypophysectomy, both DMBA metabolic activity and a 57K protein which is distinct from P450XXI disappear from rat adrenal microsomes. ACTH restores both 57K protein and DMBA metabolic activity in hypophysectomized rats almost to the levels in intact untreated rats, but not to levels in ACTH-induced intact rats. The 57K protein has been partially purified from solubilized microsomes in a single step, using detergent elution from a new HPLC matrix consisting of monolayers of phosphatidylcholine covalently bound to a silica support. The resulting P450 preparation contains a single major (57K) band, constituting approximately 70% of the total protein (specific content, 2 nmol P450/mg protein; turnover number, 1.5 nmol DMBA min-1. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against this preparation also recognizes a single ACTH-inducible 57K rat adrenal microsomal protein on immunoblots and dose-dependently inhibits DMBA metabolism in solubilized reconstituted rat adrenal microsomes. This 57K P450 is immunochemically distinct from rat P450s of the I, II, III, XVII, and XXI families, but it is immunochemically closely related to a 55K benz(a)anthracene-inducible P450 in the 10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblast cell line.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a 28-amino acid peptide, is produced and secreted by cardiac atriocytes to modulate cardiovascular functions. Recently, biologically active receptors for ANP have been demonstrated in the spleen; we report here the production of ANP-(5-28) and its 15-kDa (K) mol wt (Mr) presumptive precursors by macrophages of rat splenic tissues. Splenic, hypothalamic, and heart tissues were collected from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and acid extracted for ANP assay. The splenic content of immunoreactive (ir) ANP (mean +/- SEM, 428 +/- 68 pg/tissue; n = 7) was approximately a fifth of that found in the hypothalamus and about 4 orders of magnitude lower than that in the heart of the same animals. The Sephadex G-50 column profile of splenic extracts revealed two immunoreactive peaks; the major peak eluted in positions consistent with 15K Mr, while a minor peak coeluted with synthetic rat ANP-(1-28) of 3K Mr. HPLC analysis of the 3K Mr species showed a single peak of immunoreactivity, which eluted with a retention time similar to that of ANP-(5-28). In rat splenic sections, immunoperoxidase localization of ir-ANP revealed positive cells sparsely distributed in marginal sinuses and the red pulp of the tissue; employing a double staining technique, S22, a surface marker for macrophages, was colocalized on the same splenocytes. Furthermore, colorimetric in situ hybridization with antisense oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin, identified specific signals for pro-ANP mRNA in splenocytes of tissue sections. In monolayer cultures of vehicle-treated splenocytes, approximately 87% of the adherent cells stained positive for S22; this marker was colocalized with ir-ANP in approximately 15% of the cells. Twenty-four-hour treatment with lipopolysaccharide (50 micrograms/ml), a bacterial endotoxin, tripled the proportion of adherent cells (32 +/- 4%; P less than 0.01) staining positive for ir-ANP over that in control cultures (mean +/- SEM, 11 +/- 3%; 10(4) cells/sample; n = 5). Furthermore, an equivalent dose of lipopolysaccharide, but not Concanavalin-A (50 micrograms/ml), quadrupled ir-ANP content compared to that in vehicle-treated cultures (less than 5 pg/well). Thus, our findings suggest that ANP-(5-28) is produced by a small population of splenic macrophages and raise the possibility that the peptide may play a signalling role at the tissue level.\r"

Studies at 4, 6, 8, and 12 months of age were correlated with morphometric and biochemical examinations of peroral jejunal biopsy specimens. Permeability was increased at all ages in the group fed gluten free diet compared with control dogs, although there were no differences in villus height, intraepithelial lymphocyte density, and alkaline phosphatase activity. At four months, permeability in the normal diet group was greater than in controls, although comparable with that in the gluten free diet group. Permeability in the normal diet group increased further in conjunction with the development of partial villus atrophy and reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, and by 12 months permeability was significantly greater than in their gluten free diet litter mates and the control dogs. The findings suggest that an underlying permeability abnormality may be involved in the pathogenesis of gluten sensitive enteropathy in Irish setter dogs.\r"

Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment include limiting treatment to patients with well-documented sustained increases in blood pressure, giving higher priority to the treatment of patients with diastolic blood pressures of 100 mm Hg and above, and relying on lower-cost medications if clinical responses to treatment permit. In patients with mild hypertension, a comparison of strategies for initiating pharmacological treatment that takes into account potential side effects as well as the costs of medications indicates a difference of $270/patient-yr between the least and most expensive alternatives. Whether the additional costs of more expensive treatment strategies are \"worth it\" depend on any additional health benefits actually conferred. Moreover, higher-cost strategies may have negative influences on patients' decisions to adhere to prescribed regimens or to continue in treatment. Cost is a particular problem for the treatment of chronic conditions like hypertension because of inadequate insurance coverage for medications, especially for the poor.\r"

A nucleotide substitution has been shown to cause this hereditary condition in caucasians of French Canadian origin. Heterogeneity in molecular mechanisms for TBG-CD has also been reported. Genomic DNA from a Japanese male exhibiting TBG-CD was subjected to polymerase chain reaction, and the generated DNA fragments were sequenced. A single nucleotide deletion was found in the first base of the codon for amino acid 352 of the common-type TBG molecule. This mutation causes a frameshift in translation and premature termination. Compared with common-type TBG, the mutated polypeptide results in 1) 22 different amino acids on its carboxy-terminus, 2) a 22-amino acid truncation, and 3) the absence of a potential N-linked glycosylation site. These alterations may lead to profound changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of the molecule. To ascertain the presence of this nucleotide deletion in the genomic DNA of affected subjects, a mutated primer was designed which together with the nucleotide deletion produced a new endonuclease restriction site in the polymerase chain reaction fragment. Results revealed the presence of the mutation in genomic DNA of the subject, and his mother was shown to have both mutant and normal alleles. The same mutation was also detected in five other unrelated families carrying TBG-CD. This mutation may be frequent in Japanese subjects with TBG-CD.\r"

Patients randomly received increasing dosages of oral micronized or transdermal estradiol for 4 week, with progesterone added in the last 2 weeks, to mimic a normal hormonal cycle. Serum samples were assayed throughout treatment and compared to those from normally cycling premenopausal controls. In general, serum estradiol remained within the normal range in both treatment groups, whereas peak serum estrone levels were 10-fold higher in the orally treated group than those in the transdermally treated group. Serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, thyroid binding globulin, and renin substrate were all significantly elevated by day 14 in the orally treated patients and unchanged in the transdermal subjects. While plasminogen was unaltered by either route of administration, antithrombin-III levels fell with both treatments. Changes in gonadotropin levels were similar in both groups, with suppression of FSH by the end of the simulated cycles, but not into the normal premenopausal range. In conclusion, both estrogen replacement regimens provided near-normal serum estradiol profiles. However, despite the relatively high doses necessary to mimic a hormonally normal cycle, the transdermal route did not significantly alter the hepatic parameters studied, suggesting that this route of administration may have less adverse hepatic effects.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of several cytokines on HLA-DR expression in cultured fibroblasts derived from retroocular connective tissue and pretibial and abdominal skin of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) and pretibial dermopathy (PTD), as well as from normal individuals. We hypothesized that differences in response to cytokines between fibroblasts from various anatomical areas might play a role in the site-selective involvement of the extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease. HLA-DR expression in fibroblasts was quantitated by scanning densitometry of whole cell lysates subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Direct immunofluorescence of cell monolayers was also performed. We hypothesize that unique characteristics of these fibroblasts may play a role in GO and PTD. Cultured retroocular, pretibial, and abdominal fibroblasts from patients with Graves' disease as well as from normal individuals did not express HLA-DR spontaneously. Treatment in vitro with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma; 100 U/mL) for 5 days induced HLA-DR by 50- to 80-fold (P less than 0.0001) in fibroblasts from all sites and subjects studied. However, IFN gamma-induced HLA-DR expression was significantly greater in retroocular (P less than 0.005) and pretibial (P less than 0.0005) fibroblasts from patients with GO and PTD than in fibroblasts obtained from the same anatomical sites of normal individuals. Further, retroocular and pretibial fibroblasts from patients with GO and PTD responded to IFN gamma more vigorously than did abdominal fibroblasts from these same patients (P less than 0.0001). IFN gamma-induced HLA-DR expression was enhanced by concomitant treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (100 U/mL). In contrast, treatment of retroocular fibroblasts with transforming growth factor-beta (10 ng/mL), epidermal growth factor (1 ng/mL), or interleukin-6 (IL-6; 100 U/mL) significantly attenuated IFN gamma-induced HLA-DR reactivity by 40-59% (P less than 0.05). Incubation of retroocular fibroblasts with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 alpha (10 U/mL), IL-2 (10 U/mL), IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (100 U/mL), epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta alone did not affect HLA-DR expression. These results indicate that several cytokines can influence HLA-DR expression in cultured fibroblasts. The enhanced induction of HLA-DR by IFN gamma in retroocular and pretibial fibroblasts compared with that in abdominal fibroblasts may partially explain the selective involvement of the retroocular connective tissue and pretibial skin in fully expressed Graves disease.\r"

Ovarian growth blocking IgGs were found in 21 of the 26 premature ovarian failure (POF) cases. The few cases characterized by the absence of follicles (streak ovaries) and the controls were negative. The ovarian blocking IgGs were far more prevalent in the POF cases than anti-cytoplasmic ovarian antibodies detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (only one of the 26 POF patients was positive).

  ".W": "The responses of both plasma TSH and free T3 (FT3) to TRH were examined in 31 patients with Graves' disease who were euthyroid after treatment with antithyroid drugs, 6 patients with primary hypothyroidism, and 14 control subjects. TSH was measured 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min and FT3 was measured 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after TRH injection (500 microgram, iv). The increment in FT3 above the basal level (delta FT3) in normal controls ranged from 1.2-3.7 pmol/L, with a mean +/- SD of 2.2 +/- 0.8 pmol/L. The mean (+/- SD) delta FT3 in patients with primary hypothyroidism was 0.3 +/- 0.2 pmol/L. After the TRH test, antithyroid drugs were stopped in patients with Graves' disease. Nine of 31 Graves' patients relapsed within 6 months after the TRH test. The other 22 patients with Graves' disease were followed while in remission during the observation period of up to 48 months. The mean (+/- SD) delta FT3 were significantly lower in 9 Graves' patients who relapsed than in those who achieved remission (0.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.1 pmol/L; P less than 0.01). Eight of 9 Graves' patients who relapsed showed lower delta FT3 values than the lowest value (1.1 pmol/L) in 22 Graves' patients in remission. Although the mean increment of TSH above the basal level (delta TSH) was also significantly different between the Graves' patients who relapsed and those in remission (1.4 vs. 12.3 mU/L; P less than 0.01), there was considerable overlap between the 2 groups. These findings suggest that delta FT3 reflects the endocrinological recovery of the pituitary-thyroid axis and is a beneficial indicator for the termination of antithyroid drugs in Graves' disease.\r"

  ".U": "91310773\r", 
  ".W": "A prospective study was undertaken during pregnancy in 120 euthyroid women presenting with mild thyroid abnormalities (TA): 11 with a past history of thyroid disorder, 44 with goiter, 20 with nodules, and 45 with thyroid autoantibodies. The aims of the study were to assess whether the pattern of thyroid alterations during gestation was different in women with TA compared to that in healthy control pregnant subjects and to evaluate possible obstetrical and neonatal repercussions. The overall prevalence of underlying subtle thyroid abnormalities in the cohort was 17%, probably as the result of the environmental moderately low iodine intake. Despite the intrinsic heterogeneity of the four groups of women with TA, the adaptation of the thyroid to the stress of pregnancy was different from that of the control subjects. Noteworthy were 1) the marked elevation of serum thyroglobulin in women with past history of thyroid disorder, goiter and thyroid nodules; 2) the increase in goiter size in a third of the goitrous women, associated with biochemical evidence of functional stimulation of the gland; 3) the indirect evidence of partial thyroidal autonomy in goitrous patients; and 4) the increase in the number and size of thyroid nodules during gestation. Taken together, the data indicated that pregnancy was associated with a greater thyroidal risk in patients with TA compared to healthy subjects. In relation to thyroid autoimmunity, most patients remained euthyroid during gestation, but in a few cases, TSH was elevated at delivery, suggesting diminished thyroidal reserve. Also, 40% of newborns from mothers with thyroid autoimmunity had elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers at birth, and there was a highly significant correlation between maternal and neonatal thyroid peroxidase antibody titers. Finally, thyroid autoimmunity was clearly associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (13.3 vs. 3.3%; P less than 0.001). Thyroid function in newborns from mothers with TA was normal and not different from that in controls; similarly, obstetrical features were similar in patients with TA and control subjects. In conclusion, pregnancy is associated with a greater thyroidal risk in women with TA, thereby emphasizing a potential link between pregnancy and thyroid disorders. It is recommended that patients with known, even subtle, thyroid abnormalities be closely monitored during pregnancy, in particular those with a goiter, nodules, or thyroid autoimmunity, especially in areas with a moderately low iodine intake, where the prevalence of mild thyroid disturbances is high.\r"

When he improved he was discharged on oral treatment only to return two days later, extremely unwell, with headaches, fever, sweats, tachycardia and hypotension. A lumbar puncture showed modest neutrophil pleocytosis but despite empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and cefuroxime he continued to deteriorate. Culture of cerebrospinal fluid subsequently grew Enterococcus faecalis that was resistant to trimethoprim and sensitive to ampicillin, rifampicin, and vancomycin. After a change in treatment to intravenous ampicillin and rifampicin he dramatically improved. Enterococcal meningitis is rare in adults but important to recognise and treat appropriately in view of its high mortality and relative resistance to antibiotics. In our case the combination of HIV infection and previous treatment with antibiotics or steroids, or both, were probable predisposing factors.\r"

  ".W": "The potential for proarrhythmic responses to the class IC sodium channel-blocking drugs encainide and flecainide has not been well described in young patients. Therefore, data were retrospectively collected from 36 institutions regarding 579 young patients who were administered encainide or flecainide for treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (encainide 86 patients, flecainide 369 patients) or ventricular arrhythmias (encainide 21 patients, flecainide 103 patients) to assess the frequency of proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death during therapy (adverse events). The two drugs were similar in regard to efficacy (flecainide 71.4%, encainide 59.8%) and rate of proarrhythmic responses (flecainide 7.4%; encainide 7.5%). However, patients receiving encainide more frequently experienced cardiac arrest (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.3%, p less than 0.05) or died during treatment (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.1%, p less than 0.05). Detailed data were provided for 44 patients experiencing one or more adverse events. Patient age, previous drug trials, concomitant therapy and days of inpatient monitoring were similar for patients receiving encainide or flecainide. However, echocardiographic left ventricular shortening before treatment was lower among patients receiving encainide (0.23 +/- 0.09) than among those receiving flecainide (0.34 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05). Plasma drug concentrations were rarely elevated. Cardiac arrest (12 patients) and deaths (13 patients) occurred predominantly among patients with underlying heart disease, particularly among patients receiving flecainide for supraventricular tachycardia (8.3% vs. 0.3%, p less than 0.001). Fifteen patients with an ostensibly normal heart and normal ventricular function experienced proarrhythmia during treatment for supraventricular tachycardia, but only 3 of the 15 had a cardiac arrest or died. The relatively high incidence of adverse events should be considered when contemplating treatment with encainide or flecainide, particularly among patients with underlying heart disease.\r"

Within the follow-up period, recurrent myocardial infarction was observed in 8 patients, whereas the remaining 12 patients showed no clinical evidence of recurrence. The patients in the reinfarction group were characterized by a more pronounced depletion of and sustained lower levels of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity than were the patients with no reinfarction (p less than 0.05). The decrease in fibrinolytic activity during rt-PA therapy was significantly associated with a depletion of functional alpha 2-antiplasmin, the primary plasmin inhibitor. These results indicate that, paradoxically, coronary thrombolysis with rt-PA involves depletion of endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels, which constitutes a risk for early myocardial reinfarction.\r"

To test the hypothesis that secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide is disturbed in patients with persistent atrial standstill, the response of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and other neurohormonal factors during exercise was investigated in three patients with a rate-responsive ventricular demand (VVI) pacemaker implanted for confirmed persistent atrial standstill. The results were compared with those observed in eight normal subjects and patients with a rate-responsive VVI (Group A) or atrial demand (AAI) (Group B) pacemaker implanted for confirmed sick sinus syndrome. Patients in Group A displayed significant elevation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide secretion both before and during exercise (122.5 +/- 14.8 and 207.5 +/- 8.3 pg/ml, respectively) compared with those in Group B (55 +/- 14.1 and 116.4 +/- 51.5 pg/ml, respectively) and the normal subjects (18.9 +/- 9.8 and 30.8 +/- 19.2 pg/ml, respectively). This indicated development of a nonphysiologic increase in atrial volume or pressure overload, or both, in rate-responsive VVI pacing because of lack of atrioventricular synchrony. However, patients with persistent atrial standstill had undetectable (less than 10 pg/ml) or almost undetectable secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide as well as lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the circulation both before and during exercise. Changes in plasma catecholamines during exercise were similar in patients with persistent atrial standstill compared with the other groups. This study indicates that \"endocrinologic silence\" accompanies electrical and mechanical silence of the atria, which may constitute a third diagnostic clue to persistent atrial standstill.\r"

In response to cocaine administration, coronary artery cross-sectional area decreased 22 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) in non-diseased segments (p less than 0.05) and 45 +/- 18% in diseased segments (p less than 0.02). The magnitude of vasoconstriction was greater (p = 0.01) in the diseased segments. Sublingual nitroglycerin abolished the vasoconstriction in both non-diseased and diseased segments.

To evaluate the efficacy of coronary venous retroinfusion compared with systemic intravenous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), 14 dogs were studied with a copper coil-induced thrombus in the left anterior descending coronary artery. The rt-PA (24,000 fluorescence units/kg) was administered continuously, either intravenously (n = 8) or retrogradely (n = 6), for 30 min beginning 60 min after coronary occlusion. Thrombolysis was determined by repetitive coronary angiography. All dogs were killed 3 h after termination of rt-PA infusion and infarct size was measured by the triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining technique. Complete thrombolysis occurred in five of the six dogs in the retroinfusion group and four of the eight dogs in the systemic intravenous infusion group. Partial lysis was achieved in two dogs treated by intravenous infusion. Lysis did not occur in one dog treated with retroinfusion and in two dogs treated with intravenous infusion. Time to thrombolysis was 13.4 +/- 2.3 min in the retroinfusion group versus 27.8 +/- 4.8 min in the intravenous group (p less than 0.001). Myocardial functional recovery in the ischemic zone measured by two-dimensional echocardiography 60 min after reperfusion was significant only in the retroinfusion group (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Serogroup A meningococci were isolated from patients and healthy carriers in The Gambia between 1982 and 1988. The class 5 proteins expressed by these bacteria were identified by electrophoretic migration and by serologic tests. Three protein serologic groupings (seroclasses) called A (protein 5a), B (proteins 5b, 5d, or 5e), and C (protein 5c or 5C) were found among 331 bacterial isolates. The number of class 5 proteins expressed per isolate varied from none to four, with a median of two. The class 5 protein composition differed for certain paired isolates obtained from the nasopharynx, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid of diseased patients and for certain pairs of sequential isolates from the nasopharynx of healthy carriers; the medical relevance of this variation remains unclear, although the 5C protein was preferentially isolated from the nasopharynx and the 5a protein from diseased patients. The data show that a large proportion of healthy carriers in The Gambia were exposed to bacteria expressing each of the three seroclasses and that many people were exposed to bacteria expressing each of the three seroclasses and that many people were exposed to two or all three seroclasses during the epidemic of 1982-1983.\r"

By continuous intravenous administration of 10(10) cfu/kg live Escherichia coli over 8 h with additional infusion therapy (less than or equal to 50 ml/kg/h), endotoxin plasma levels of 2.7-22.3 ng/ml were observed. In plasma the kinetics of NAP-1/IL-8 and IL-6 were similar to those of IL-1 at the end of the experiment (8 h) (peak median values, 34, 4197, and 230 ng/ml, respectively). Differences were greatest for IL-6. Monocyte activation during sepsis was confirmed by elevated plasma neopterin levels (91-139 mumol/mmol of creatine). Granulocyte activation was evident from both incipient neutropenia and the massive release of neutrophil elastase into the plasma as measured by a new immunoassay (peak level, 374 ng/ml). Thus, in primate bacteremia, early TNF release is followed by a concomitant increase of NAP-1/IL-8 with plasma kinetics similar to those of IL-6 and IL-1 and accompanied by massive activation of neutrophils.\r"

With PBMC from 10 healthy women, C. albicans but not histamine induced PGE2 at a low level (100 pg/ml). However, C. albicans plus histamine acted synergistically to stimulate PGE2 production (448 pg/ml). PBMC from 8 of 10 women with recurrent candidal vaginitis also produced maximal levels of PGE2 in the presence of C. albicans plus histamine. Production of tumor necrosis factor by PBMC from patients and controls was unaffected by histamine in both the presence and absence of C. albicans. However, unlike the controls, PBMC from six of the patients who were atopic and from two nonatopic patients spontaneously released PGE2 in vitro. Addition of 4 or 10 units/ml interferon-gamma inhibited spontaneous and C. albicans-induced PGE2 production by PBMC. These data reinforce the evidence that immediate hypersensitivity responses may be involved in the etiology of recurrent candidal vaginitis.\r"

Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi have particular enzymatic reactions that have relevance for chemotherapy. Certain purine analogs are metabolized by the parasites to nucleotides and aminated to the analogs of adenine nucleotides. These halt protein synthesis and cause the break-down of RNA. The most important purine analogs with respect to chemotherapeutic potential are the pyrazolo [3,4-D]-pyrimidines. The prototype, allopurinol, is nontoxic to human beings and is aminated to adenine nucleotide analogs by the organism. Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated its antiparasitic action and led to its development as a chemotherapeutic agent for diseases caused by these organisms. Clinical investigations now have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of allopurinol in cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis and in chronic Chagas' Disease.\r"

Eighty percent of the patients who endorsed multiple episodic phenomena failed the dichotic listening task, compared with 8% of normal controls and 28% of patients with typical mood disorders. After treatment with carbamazepine, a subsample of polysymptomatic patients manifested significantly fewer seizure-like symptoms. This clinical improvement was typically associated with markedly improved dichotic listening performance in most cases. The results are consistent with our previous hypothesis that \"subclinical\" electrophysiological dysfunction may severely disrupt the normal transmission and processing of auditory information. Because it is sensitive to this type of presumed cerebral dysfunction and relatively specific, impaired dichotic listening performance is likely to be a useful clinical marker for this complex neuropsychiatric syndrome.\r"

Other members of the family with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction are presented briefly.

The possible involvement of dietary factors in the provocation of stroke-like episodes is discussed and regulation of glucose intake suggested as a strategy in the prevention of stroke-like episodes.\r"

On the other hand, some fear that prolonging the lives of infected individuals may contribute to the increased spread of the virus and to a steep rise in the overall costs of AIDS to society. To address this issue, we present a simple model of ZDV therapy against a backdrop of HIV transmission in a population of sexually active, gay men. We find no basis for the fear of dramatic increases in the incidence of AIDS or its associated costs among gay men due to widespread ZDV distribution. On the contrary, our analysis suggests that ZDV therapy is cost-effective, particularly when it is accompanied by modest efforts to promote behavior change and prevention.\r"

Five clinical variables and the sedimentation rate improved significantly in both groups without significant intergroup differences. The radiographs of hands, wrists and forefeet (32 joints evaluated according to Larsen) showed a radiological progression in 11/26 (MTX) and in 8/20 patients (GSTM); however, the deterioration of the mean Larsen index was not significant.

Thirty-two patients (30 arthritis and 2 control patients) taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) as well as corticosteroids were excluded from statistical analysis. The intake of NSAID significantly increased gut permeability in controls but not in the arthritis groups. The same applied to corticosteroid intake. This could be due to the restricted number of arthritis patients who had never taken antiinflammatory drugs or to a disease related increased permeability. There was no statistically significant difference in altered gut permeability between patients taking NSAID and patients taking corticosteroids. Our findings suggest that drug induced alteration of gut permeability may not only be accounted for by an inhibition of mucosal cyclooxygenase activity, but that other enzymatic pathways in the arachidonic cascade might be implicated.\r"

Gut permeability was found to be increased in the 3 patient groups, partially due to the intake of antiinflammatory drugs. When only patients not taking these drugs were considered, an increased gut permeability was found in patients with SpA and IBD. In patients with RA gut permeability could not be evaluated as they were all taking antiinflammatory medication. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsies of the gut was performed in 62 of the 73 patients with SpA and disclosed subclinical gut inflammation in 21. No difference in gut permeability was found between patients with or without gut inflammation. However, when the type of gut inflammation was considered, a significant increase of gut permeability was found in patients with chronic gut inflammation compared with patients presenting acute lesions. Our findings again suggest that the chronic gut inflammation seen in SpA is fundamentally different from acute gut inflammation and possibly related to the gut inflammation of IBD.\r"

To investigate whether chondrocytes may also function as accessory cells in ongoing immune processes, mixed leukocyte-chondrocyte cultures and antigen presentation assays were studied. Freshly isolated and short term cultured HLA class II antigen (Ia) negative as well as gamma-interferon treated Ia positive chondrocytes were weakly or not stimulatory to allogeneic or autologous resting lymphocytes derived from either normal donors or patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In an antigen presenting system using tetanus toxoid, the majority of chondrocyte preparations tested induced an antigen driven response in HLA matched allogeneic or autologous resting T cells which, however, was much less when compared to blood monocytes. In contrast, using activated T cells derived from tetanus toxoid specific T cell lines, an efficient antigen presenting capacity could be demonstrated in both Ia positive and initially Ia negative chondrocytes. Interestingly, the latter population had acquired Ia antigens upon incubation with the T cell line.\r"

Of the 14 patients with primary disease 13 had grade 3/4 or 4/4 sarcoma and 13 of 14 underwent initial radical orchiectomy. In addition, 6 of the 14 patients underwent an adjuvant operation or radiotherapy to the groin, or groin and scrotum, and none had local relapse. Some patients also had chemotherapy. Three patients underwent adjuvant retroperitoneal node dissection and 2 had microscopically positive nodes. All 3 patients remain without relapse. Six patients had relapse: 2 locally, 2 in the retroperitoneal nodes and 2 with distant metastases. Only 1 patient (with scrotal recurrence) was salvaged. Of the 7 patients referred with recurrent disease none was salvaged. In this series there is a 2 of 14 (14%) risk of local failure and a 4 of 14 (28%) risk of retroperitoneal relapse after radical orchiectomy. Since salvage has not proved successful, patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, intermediate or high grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma, or fibrosarcoma should be considered for adjuvant retroperitoneal node dissection. All patients should undergo adjuvant dissection or irradiation of the ipsilateral pelvic and groin nodes, and scrotum.\r"

Circularly oriented tissues were taken from within the renal pelvis and subdivided into the four adjoining regions, from fornix to pelviureteric junction (PUJ). They were set in a tissue bath and isometric tension changes were recorded. Spontaneous contractions were observed and electrical field stimulations evoked twitch-like contractions. The frequency of spontaneous contractions was dependent on the region within the renal pelvis from which they were dissected, gradually decreasing from fornix (3.92/min.) to PUJ (0.43/min.). Indomethacin (10(-5)M) or ASA (10(-4)M) significantly increased the frequencies of spontaneous contractions in all four regions. In the upper three regions (pacemaker regions), both agents significantly decreased the amplitudes of spontaneous and stimulation-induced contractions. In the PUJ region, both agents significantly increased the amplitudes of spontaneous and stimulation-induced contractions. SC-19220 (3 x 10(-5)M) significantly increased the frequencies and decreased amplitudes of spontaneous contractions in all four regions. These results suggest that the PUJ has different contractile characteristics from those of pacemaker regions and that decrease of amplitude by indomethacin or ASA is based on their cyclooxygenase inhibitor property.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that perioperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN) decreases the incidence of serious complications after major abdominal or thoracic surgical procedures in malnourished patients. METHODS. We studied 395 malnourished patients (99 percent of them male) who required laparotomy or noncardiac thoracotomy. They were randomly assigned to receive either TPN for 7 to 15 days before surgery and 3 days afterward (the TPN group) or no perioperative TPN (the control group). The patients were monitored for complications for 90 days after surgery. RESULTS. The rates of major complications during the first 30 days after surgery in the two groups were similar (TPN group, 25.5 percent; control group, 24.6 percent), as were the overall 90-day mortality rates (13.4 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively). There were more infectious complications in the TPN group than in the controls (14.1 vs. 6.4 percent; P = 0.01; relative risk, 2.20; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 4.05), but slightly more noninfectious complications in the control group (16.7 vs. 22.2 percent; P = 0.20; relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 1.13). The increased rate of infections was confined to patients categorized as either borderline or mildly malnourished, according to Subjective Global Assessment or an objective nutritional assessment, and these patients had no demonstrable benefit from TPN. In contrast, severely malnourished patients who received TPN had fewer noninfectious complications than controls (5 vs. 43 percent; P = 0.03; relative risk, 0.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.91), with no concomitant increase in infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS. The use of preoperative TPN should be limited to patients who are severely malnourished unless there are other specific indications.\r"

  ".W": "Deposits of beta-amyloid are one of the main pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. The beta-amyloid peptide constituent (relative molecular mass 4,200) of the deposits is derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) which is expressed in several different isoforms. The two most prevalent beta-APP isoforms are distinguished by either the presence (beta-APP751) or absence (beta-APP695) of a Kunitz serine protease inhibitor domain. Changes in the abundance of different beta-APP messenger RNAs in brains of Alzheimer's disease victims have been widely reported. Although these results have been controversial, most evidence favours an increase in the mRNAs encoding protease inhibitor-containing isoforms of beta-APP and it is proposed that this change contributes to beta-amyloid formation. We have now produced an imbalance in the normal neuronal ratio of beta-APP isoforms by preparing transgenic mice expressing additional beta-APP751 under the control of a neural-specific promoter. The cortical and hippocampal brain regions of the transgenic mice display extracellular beta-amyloid immunoreactive deposits varying in size (less than 5-50 microns) and abundance. These results suggest that one mechanism of beta-amyloid formation may involve a disruption of the normal ratio of neuronal beta-APP isoform expression and support a direct relationship between increased expression of Kunitz inhibitor-bearing beta-APP isoforms and beta-amyloid deposition.\r"

Evoked cochlear emissions reportedly are identifiable in 90 to 100% of normal-hearing infants.

Scatchard analysis of 65Zn2+ binding to hGH showed that two Zn2+ ions associate per dimer of hGH in a cooperative fashion. Cobalt (II) can substitute for Zn2+ in the hormone dimer and gives a visible spectrum characteristic of cobalt coordinated in a tetrahedral fashion by oxygen- and nitrogen-containing ligands. Replacement of potential Zn2+ ligands (His18, His21, and Glu174) in hGH with alanine weakened both Zn2+ binding and hGH dimer formation. The Zn(2+)-hGH dimer was more stable than monomeric hGH to denaturation in guanidine-HCl. Formation of a Zn(2+)-hGH dimeric complex may be important for storage of hGH in secretory granules.\r"

Electrophysiological recordings from floccular Purkinje cells have allowed the identification of their firing patterns during generation of the image velocity and image acceleration signals used for pursuit. Analysis with a method based on a behavioral model converted the time-varying spike trains of floccular Purkinje cells into a description of the firing rate contributed by three visual motion signals and one oculomotor input. The flocculus encodes all the signals needed to guide pursuit.\r"

We sought to determine whether this phenomenon is partly mediated by lipopolysaccharide-induced mesenteric hypoperfusion. We assessed permeability in an isolated segment of ileum by measuring plasma-to-lumen clearances (C) for two probes, 51Cr-EDTA and urea, and expressing the results as a ratio (CEDTA/CUREA). In control pigs (n = 6) resuscitated with Ringer's lactate (RL), mucosal permeability was unchanged during the 210-minute period of observation. In pigs (n = 7) infused with lipopolysaccharide (50 micrograms/kg) and similarly resuscitated with RL, mesenteric perfusion (Qsma) decreased significantly and permeability increased progressively and significantly. When endotoxic pigs (n = 6) were resuscitated with a regimen (RL plus hetastarch plus dobutamine) that preserved normal Qsma, lipopolysaccharide-induced mucosal hyperpermeability was prevented. Resuscitation of endotoxic pigs (n = 6) with RL plus hetastarch provided intermediate protection against both mesenteric hypoperfusion and increased permeability. These data suggest that diminished Qsma contributes to impaired ileal mucosal barrier function in experimental endotoxicosis.\r"

The changes in superior mesenteric artery resistance (RSMA) and systemic vascular resistance (RSYS) during angiotensin II infusion were measured by Doppler flow probe in normal rabbits (NL) and portal hypertensive rabbits (PHT), and in NL and PHT after cyclooxygenase blockade (CO) and after CO and during continuous PGI2 infusion at 300 ng/kg/min. Angiotensin II infusion in NL caused a disproportionately greater increase in RSMA than in RSYS (p less than 0.01). In PHT, angiotensin II response of RSMA was reduced from NL (p less than 0.05). CO dramatically improved the splanchnic response to angiotensin II in PHT animals, but did not significantly alter the RSMA response in NL. PGI2 in NL, NL + CO, and PHT + CO quantitatively established the splanchnic vascular hyporesponsiveness to angiotensin II seen in PHT. We conclude that PGI2 will directly diminish splanchnic response to angiotensin II in NL, and CO will ablate differences in splanchnic response between NL and PHT to angiotensin II. This strongly implies that much of the observed decrease in angiotensin II response in PHT is mediated by PGI2 and that the differences between NL and PHT vascular response is in part the result of circulating vasodilatory substances.\r"

Furthermore, little is known about the effects of defined diets on host immune defenses. To address these questions, we measured BT and immune reactivity in rats fed a normal diet or enteral elemental (ORAL-TPN) diet. After 7 days on the elemental or normal diet, the rats were killed, and BT and mitogen responsiveness to concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin were measured. In separate experiments, the effects of these diets on in vivo host defenses was measured with a Staphylococcus aureus abscess model. Additional experiments were performed to determine the time required to reverse ORAL-TPN-induced BT and impairment of host immune defenses by reinstituting normal feedings. Administration of the ORAL-TPN diet for 7 days was associated with BT to the mesenteric lymph node complex of all animals, decreased blastogenic response of blood and splenic lymphocytes to mitogens, and decreased ability to control an in vivo infectious challenge with S. aureus. Each of the derangements was reversed by the reinstitution of normal feedings. In summary, the enteral administration of an elemental diet for 7 days is associated with disruption of the gut microflora, BT, and the development of an immunocompromised state, all of which can be reversed by refeeding the animals a normal diet.\r"

The 331 patients were recruited over an 18-month period, with 256 patients remaining more than 48 hours. Stratification by acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) preceded randomization to control (standard antibiotic therapy) or treatment (SDD) groups. Nosocomial infection was significantly reduced in the SDD group (16.7%; 21 of 126 patients) compared with the control group (30.8%; 40 of 130 patients; p = 0.008). No difference was found in overall mortality rate or length of stay between the two groups. Those patients with admission APACHE II scores 10 to 19 demonstrated the most significant reduction in nosocomial infection (23 of 70 control vs 13 of 76 SDD; p = 0.03) and mortality (15 of 70 control vs 8 of 76 SDD; p = 0.07). Emergence of multiresistant microorganisms was not a clinical problem, but a definite change occurred in the ecology of environmental and colonizing bacteria. With the exception of cefotaxime, a reduction was noted in systemic antibiotic usage in the SDD group. We conclude that SDD is useful in selected patients in a mixed intensive care unit.\r"

Impaired macrophage respiratory burst activity (superoxide anion [O2-] generation) occurs in PCM, but cellular mechanisms are unclear. The major pathway resulting in O2- production involves inositol lipid-dependent signal transduction. This study examined the effect of mild versus severe PCM on macrophage O2- generating signal transduction pathways specific for responses to Candida albicans. Mice (CFW/Swiss Webster: n = 300) were randomized to either control or low protein diets for 3 or 8 weeks. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested for O2- production, mannose-fucose receptor (MFR) expression, membrane phospholipid analysis, arachidonic acid (AA) content, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, and protein kinase C levels. O2- release was impaired in both mild and severe PCM. MFR expression was also decreased at these time points. Inositol lipid content was significantly lower at the 8-week time point only, although PGE2 and AA were significantly higher in the low protein diet group at 3 weeks. Protein kinase C levels were unchanged by PCM. Thus, mild PCM significantly increases macrophage-PGE2 production secondary to increased AA phospholipid content, with subsequent inhibition of O2- and MFR expression. Severe PCM inhibits macrophage (O2-) through depletion of critical membrane phospholipid components with subsequent impairment in signal transduction.\r"

To clarify these relationships, high energy phosphate ratios, intracellular pH, and phosphocreatine breakdown rates were measured in vivo in the gastrocnemius muscle of adult male Wistar rats after cecal ligation and puncture or sham operation with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and Na(+)-K+ ATPase and creatine kinase activities were determined in vitro. Within 24 hours, Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity increased by 60% in rats with cecal ligation and puncture, all of which had positive bacterial cultures, as compared to none of the sham-operated controls. Phosphocreatine/ATP ratios decreased by 20% in association with a quantitatively similar increase in phosphocreatine breakdown (9.7 +/- 0.5 vs 11.9 +/- 0.5 mumoles/gm wet wt/sec; p = 0.01). ATP concentrations were maintained, and intracellular pH did not change significantly. In this model, changes in phosphocreatine breakdown were not related to total creatine kinase activity, which did not change significantly, or increases in adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) concentration (62 +/- 8 vs 92 +/- 8 mumols/L; p = 0.02). Thus, in early sepsis before a measurable decrease in pH occurs, ATP is utilized at an increased rate to help maintain ionic balance and/or to support other metabolic processes. Phosphocreatine stores are used to buffer ATP concentrations.\r"

Treatment with FK 506 or cyclosporine A (CsA) was started after clinical and histologic evidence of acute GVHD was present. A 14-day course of FK 506 at 1.0 mg/kg/day could rescue 100% of the animals suffering from GVHD. In contrast only one half of the animals treated with CsA at a high dose of 25 mg/kg/day recovered. After cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, FK 506-treated animals displayed a marked prolonged disease-free interval as compared to CsA-treated bone marrow recipients. Recurrence of the disease in these animals could be prevented when FK 506 treatment was continued after the induction period with a low maintenance dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day every other day.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in knowledge of the structure of the T-cell receptor and of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules have increased our understanding of the nature of their interaction in the immune response. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the T-cell receptor recognizes foreign MHC molecules in the process of graft rejection. One approach to this problem is to characterize the alloreactivity of a given T-cell receptor. We have chosen to take this approach in vivo by examining patterns of rejection of vascularized heart allografts in transgenic mice carrying a rearranged T-cell receptor-beta-chain gene, in which essentially all alpha beta T cells bear the rearranged gene product. Heterotopic heart allografts were performed in transgene-positive and transgene-negative recipients. The data show that transgene-positive mice will reject fully allogeneic grafts of three different haplotypes after a modest delay, but will not reject grafts from F1 mice that bear H-2 antigens from these same haplotypes and from the recipient strain. Transgene-negative animals reject all grafts promptly. These results suggest that the restricted T-cell receptor repertoire expressed by transgene-positive recipients affects their ability to respond to an alloantigen as expressed on a vascularized graft and that this response is influenced by the presence of self-MHC molecules on the graft.\r"

The 92 patients in the survey had a mean age of 56 (range 13-97) years. A microbiological diagnosis was established in 72%; Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (18%), and influenza A virus (8%) were the most common microorganisms. Other causative organisms were Legionella pneumophila (4 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Nocardia brasiliensis (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). Chlamydia sp, influenza B virus and adenovirus were each found in one case; all were cultured on nasopharygeal aspirates. Aspiration was considered to be the underlying cause in five patients, two with epilepsy and one with pseudobulbar palsy. Five of the six deaths that occurred were in patients over 75 years of age and the other was 69. In four of the six the established causative organisms were Chlamydia sp (1), K pneumoniae (1), and S aureus (2). Patients had a 16 fold increased risk of death if they had two or more of the following on admission: a respiratory rate of 30/minute or more, diastolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg or less, and either confusion or a plasma urea concentration greater than 7.0 mmol/l.\r"

Global comparison of their efficacy shows that alteplase is slightly more effective (71 percent) in restoring patency than anistreplase (60 percent) and streptokinase (58 percent). Streptokinase and anistreplase are allergenic, and repeat administration is not feasible in the short-term, a distinct advantage for alteplase. More accurate dosing of thrombolytic agents and skillful use of aspirin and heparin improve the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy but can also increase the risk of bleeding. A recanalization rate of 90 percent or more could be achieved if the thrombolytic agent is administered within the first hour after thrombosis. Administration this soon after the development of thrombosis may be possible if the agent is given outside the hospital by practicing physicians or, perhaps, paramedics.\r"

In contrast, the combination of t-PA and urokinase, when given intravenously prior to coronary angiography, appears to be associated with a low incidence of post-rescue angioplasty reocclusion. In order to determine whether intraprocedural urokinase, given at the time of rescue coronary angioplasty for failed t-PA therapy, improves long-term patency of the infarct vessel to the same extent as preangiographic, combination t-PA/urokinase therapy, three thrombolytic treatment strategies were retrospectively compared. The first group included 86 patients undergoing rescue angioplasty after t-PA monotherapy (t-PA alone). The clinical and angiographic outcomes of these patients were compared with those of 24 patients who received intravenous or intracoronary urokinase during rescue angioplasty following unsuccessful t-PA therapy (sequential t-PA/urokinase therapy), and with those of 34 patients undergoing rescue coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful therapy with the combination of intravenous t-PA and urokinase (simultaneous therapy). There was no difference in postangioplasty patency rate of the infarct-related artery between the three groups. However, the sequential t-PA/urokinase regimen was associated with a subsequent reocclusion rate that was lower than the rate that occurred in the t-PA monotherapy group but higher than the rate in the simultaneous t-PA/urokinase group (13 versus 29 versus 2%, respectively; p = 0.003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bypass surgery was of emergency nature (less than 24 hours from treatment with intravenous thrombolytic therapy) in 36 (2.6%) and was deferred (greater than 24 hours) in 267 (19.3%) patients. The indications for bypass surgery included failed angioplasty (12%); left main or equivalent coronary disease (9%); complex or multivessel coronary disease (62%); recurrent postinfarction angina (13%); and refractory pump dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture or abnormal predischarge functional test (1% each). Although patients having bypass surgery were older (59.5 +/- 9.8 versus 56.0 +/- 10.2 years, (p less than 0.0001), had more extensive coronary artery disease (46% with three-vessel disease versus 11%, (p less than 0.0001), had more frequent diabetes mellitus (19% versus 15%, (p = 0.048), had more prior infarctions (p less than 0.0001), had more severe initial depression in global left ventricular ejection fraction (48.0 +/- 11.9% versus 51.8 +/- 11.9%, p = 0.0002), and regional infarct zone (-2.7 +/- 0.94 versus -2.5 +/- 1.1 SD/chord, p = 0.02) and noninfarct zone function (-0.36 +/- 1.8 versus 0.43 +/- 1.6 SD/chord, p less than 0.0001) than patients not having coronary bypass surgery, no difference in the incidence of death in hospital (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) or death at long-term follow-up of hospital survivors (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) was noted between groups. Surgical patients demonstrated a greater degree of recovery in left ventricular ejection fraction (3.4 +/- 9.8% versus 0.16 +/- 8.5%, p = 0.036) and infarct zone regional function (0.71 +/- 1.1 versus 0.34 +/- 0.99 SD/chord, p = 0.001) when immediate (90 minutes following initiation of thrombolytic therapy) and predischarge (7 to 14 days after treatment) contrast left ventriculograms were compared than did patients who received only intravenous thrombolytic therapy with or without coronary angioplasty. These data suggest a beneficial influence of coronary bypass surgery on left ventricular function and possibly on the clinical outcome of patients initially treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Frequent blood sampling as performed in three groups with a first AMI: 29 patients treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy who had a patent infarct-related artery with normal flow (TIMI-3) at acute catheterization (reperfusion group); four patients with a persistently closed infarct-related artery (no reperfusion group); and 44 patients who did not receive any therapy aimed at coronary reperfusion (no thrombolytic therapy group). In the latter group we prospectively estimated that 25% would have spontaneous reperfusion. A physiologically based computer-calculated multi-compartment method was used to determine the characteristics of the serum CK-MB time-activity curve. In addition to demonstrating an earlier increase, a shorter time to peak of serum CK-MB and a lower estimated infarct size in the reperfusion group (p = 0.025 to 0.00001), the appearance rate constant (k1) and time from estimated initial increase to peak of CK-MB in the blood stream (tRP) were significantly different from those values in the no thrombolytic therapy group (p less than 00001). A cutoff level indicating reperfusion if k1 was greater than 0.185 or tRP was less than 16.5 hours demonstrated overlapping values between these two groups in only four patients (k1), two patients (tRP), and six patients with a combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The sequential use of different types of antiarrhythmic drugs may improve arrhythmia prognosis in chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter after successful electrical cardioversion. The rationale for serial treatment is that the arrhythmogenic mechanism may vary between patients, leading to different responses to 1 specific drug. To investigate this issue prospectively, 127 patients having chronic fibrillation or flutter exclusively, underwent serial drug treatment with flecainide (stage I) followed by sotalol or, if contraindicated, quinidine (stage II) and eventually amiodarone (stage III). Stages II and III were entered after electrical recardioversion for a recurrence during stages I or II, respectively. Calculated on an actuarial basis, the 2-year cumulative percentage of patients free of the arrhythmia increased from 31% after stage I to 63% at the end of serial treatment. To reach this result, a mean of 1.8 +/- 0.8 cardioversions per patient were needed, with 53 patients progressing to stage II and 34 to stage III. Sixteen patients stopped serial treatment prematurely and 15 patients were considered to have intractable atrial fibrillation at the end of stage III. Incidence of proarrhythmia was low. Multivariate analysis disclosed that an older age, in combination with a large number of previous episodes of arrhythmia, a long previous duration of arrhythmia and presence of mitral valve disease, were predictive for medical refractoriness during serial treatment. It is concluded that serial treatment may improve arrhythmia prognosis in atrial fibrillation or flutter, with an acceptable incidence of proarrhythmic events.\r"

Urine and blood samples were collected every 30 minutes. During the latter half of SVT, urine flow increased twofold in the control subjects before SVT. Urinary sodium excretion increased significantly (p less than 0.01) within 30 minutes after SVT. Urinary excretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) decreased (p less than 0.01) during the latter half of SVT and increased (p less than 0.01) after SVT, respectively. Plasma level of ADH did not change during SVT but increased (p less than 0.05) after SVT. The concentration of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) increased significantly (p less than 0.05) before SVT ended. Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 increased significantly (p less than 0.05) after termination of SVT. The percent changes in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 were correlated (r = 0.713, p less than 0.001) with those of ADH. There was also a correlation (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001) between the percent changes in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and those of sodium. Their findings suggest that the polyuria during SVT is attributed mainly to the inhibition of ADH release and that the natriuresis after SVT is due not only to the increased ANP but also to the increased renal prostaglandin E2 probably stimulated by ADH.\r"

The electrocardiogram was monitored and blood pressure measured every minute throughout cycle ergometer exercise testing with a ramp protocol in which the work rate increased 1 W every 6 seconds after a 4-minute 20-W warm-up. Minute ventilation, oxygen uptake (VO2), and carbon dioxide output were measured every 10 seconds in order to determine anaerobic threshold (AT) and peak VO2. Five patients were excluded from evaluation before breaking the double-blind key because of insufficient data. Heart rate increased and systolic blood pressure decreased throughout the testing only in the group taking 100 mg (n = 10). Significant increases in AT (14.4 to 16.2 ml/min/kg) and peak VO2 (20.8 to 22.9 ml/min/kg) were observed in the group taking 100 mg. The increases in AT showed a dose response, namely +0.7% in the placebo (n = 9), +6.9% in the 25-mg (n = 9) and 12.5% in the 100-mg group. The work rates at the AT point increased in the 25- and 100-mg groups. These results indicate that a single oral administration of enoximone improves exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of interferon therapy on posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis, we examined the appearance of serum hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) and abnormal serum aminotransferase levels after the onset of hepatitis in 12 patients treated with interferon and in 46 patients treated conservatively. Eleven patients were given 3 million units of human fibroblast beta-interferon three times weekly for 4 wk and 1 was given one million units of human lymphoblastoid alpha-interferon daily for 3 months. In the interferon-treated patients, the effect of therapy on hepatic histology was also assessed. Detection of anti-HCV within 6 and 12 months after the onset of hepatitis was less common in interferon-treated patients than in control patients (6/12 vs 35/46 and 5/12 vs 35/46, both p = NS). At 24 months after the onset of hepatitis, anti-HCV levels were significantly lower in interferon-treated patients (0/10, p less than 0.05), but had not changed significantly in control patients (34/46). Abnormal serum aminotransferase levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after the onset of hepatitis were significantly less common in interferon-treated patients than in controls (25% vs 78.3%, p less than 0.005; 25% vs 71.7%, p less than 0.01; and 0% vs 67.4%, p less than 0.001). The percentage of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after onset of hepatitis was also less in interferon-treated patients than in control patients, both among anti-HCV-positive patients (50% vs 85.7%, p = NS; 50% vs 80%, p = NS; and 0% vs 77.1%, p less than 0.01) and among anti-HCV-negative patients (0% vs 54.5%, p = NS; 0% vs 45.5%, p = NS; and 0% vs 27.3%, p = NS). Immediately after interferon therapy, the histological activity index dropped from 6.0 +/- 4.2 to 4.8 +/- 2.5 in anti-HCV-positive patients (p = NS) and from 4.2 +/- 4.3 to 2.6 +/- 1.7 in anti-HCV-negative patients (p = NS). Biopsy specimens obtained from four patients 12-23 months after interferon therapy revealed normal histology in one anti-HCV-positive patient and two anti-HCV-negative patients, and marked improvement in the other anti-HCV-positive patient. These results indicate that short-term, low-dose interferon therapy may be effective for posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis (both anti-HCV-positive and anti-HCV-negative).\r"

Associated intestinal tract malformations have been reported in 40% of patients with intraluminal duodenal diverticula. Diagnosis is made by endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal series. In symptomatic cases, extraluminal diverticula are amenable to surgery, whereas intraluminal diverticula may be either surgically or endoscopically resected.

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: We measured the serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 70 patients with established septic shock caused predominantly by gram-negative bacteria. The aims of the study were to determine whether and for how long IL-6 was detectable in the circulation of these patients, to assess whether IL-6 levels were associated with patients' outcomes, and, finally, to examine the interplay between IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). RESULTS: IL-6 was detected in 64% of the patients at study entry but in only 18% on Day 1 and 2% on Day 10. Serum levels of IL-6 were higher (median: 3.5 ng/mL, range: less than 0.1 to 305 ng/mL) in patients dying of fulminant septic shock than in those surviving (median: 0.5 ng/mL, range: less than 0.1 to 135 ng/mL; p = 0.003) or in those with a transient reversal of shock but who ultimately died of a relapse of shock (median: less than 0.1 ng/mL, range: less than 0.1 to 12.5 ng/mL; p = 0.005). However, no cutoff values of IL-6 confidently predicted the outcome of an individual patient. The serum concentrations of IL-6 measured at study entry correlated with the duration of survival (r = -0.51, p = 0.004) and with the levels of TNF-alpha (r = 0.53; p less than 0.0001) but not with the levels of either IL-1 beta (r = 0.01, p = 0.90) or IFN-gamma (r = 0.06, p = 0.60). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that circulating levels of IL-6 are detectable in a majority of patients with gram-negative septic shock. Concentrations of IL-6 peaked near the onset of shock and rapidly decreased to undetectable levels within approximately 24 hours in most patients. Levels of IL-6 measured at study entry correlated with levels of TNF and with patients' outcomes. Yet, IL-6 does not appear to be a clinically useful laboratory test for predicting the outcome of an individual patient.\r"

Using these four methodologies, 27 of the 30 trypanosomatid isolates, as well as 5 clones, were identified as T. cruzi, whereas the remaining three isolates were classified as T. rangeli.

A prototype of a three-component fiberoptic sensor has been developed for intraarterial application by CDI, 3M Health Care, Irvine, California. We report the first study of this continuous intraarterial monitor in patients undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia. Fourteen patients participated in the study. The fiberoptic sensor was calibrated before insertion and then passed through an existing 18-gauge radial artery cannula. Blood samples were drawn at frequent intervals through the same cannula for in vitro blood gas analysis. For each of the 87 arterial blood gas samples obtained, the in vitro values of pHa, PaCO2, and PaO2 were compared with simultaneous readings from the fiberoptic sensor. For pHa, the mean error (error = fiberoptic value minus in vitro value) or \"bias\" of the fiberoptic data was -0.032 and the standard deviation of error or \"precision\" was 0.042. For PaCO2, the bias was -3.8 mm Hg and the precision was 4.7 mm Hg. For PaO2, the bias was -9.0 mm Hg and the precision was 23.3 mm Hg. For PaO2 values less than 175 mm Hg, the bias was -8.5 mm Hg and the precision was 8.3 mm Hg. Expressed in terms of percentage errors, the bias +/- precision values were -11.5% +/- 13.3% for PaCO2, and -6.2% +/- 10.0% for PaO2.

  ".U": "91314927\r", 
  ".W": "In right-to-left (RL) intracardiac shunting, the venous blood that is added to the oxygenated blood in the left heart is both poor in oxygen and rich in carbon dioxide. Thus, any given degree of arterial desaturation is associated with an obligatory arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide tension difference (PaCO2--PETCO2). This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the relationship between PaCO2-PETCO2 and arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2) in cyanotic heart disease. Using the shunt equation as a starting point, a curvilinear, negative correlation between PaCO2-PETCO2 and SaO2 can be demonstrated. The slope of the regression of PaCO2--PETCO2 against SaO2 is shown to be positively correlated to Hb concentration, PaCO2, and the respiratory quotient R. The slope of the regression is also slightly increased at relatively high SaO2s and at high inspired oxygen fractions, although these latter factors are of lesser significance. However, in addition to the above primary effects of RL shunting, secondary effects may occur if pulmonary perfusion is reduced sufficiently to cause \"alveolar hypoperfusion,\" which also creates an alveolar dead space. Primary and secondary effects are additive. This theoretical analysis is illustrated with a study of 27 children with congenital heart disease. Their lungs were ventilated with a Servoventilator 900 C, and carbon dioxide single-breath tests were obtained on-line with the use of a computerized system based on the Siemens-Elema carbon dioxide analyzer 930. Blood was sampled for PaCO2 measurement and arterial Hb saturation was measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated the extent to which endogenously produced metabolities of the cyclooxygenase pathway and angiotensin II modulate the pulmonary vascular response to increasing pulmonary blood flow after a period of systemic and pulmonary hypotension and hypoperfusion (defined as posthypoperfusion) in conscious, pentobarbital-anesthetized, and halothane-anesthetized dogs. The authors tested the hypothesis that vasodilator metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway offset the vasoconstrictor influence of angiotensin II to prevent pulmonary vasoconstriction posthypoperfusion. Baseline and posthypoperfusion pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were constructed by stepwise inflation and deflation, respectively, of a hydraulic occluder implanted around the inferior vena cava to vary Q. In intact (no drug), conscious dogs, the pulmonary vascular P/Q relationship posthypoperfusion was not altered significantly compared with baseline. In contrast, after cyclooxygenase inhibition, active flow-independent pulmonary vasoconstriction (12-17%; P less than 0.01) was observed posthypoperfusion, and this response was abolished entirely by angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition. During pentobarbital anesthesia, significant pulmonary vasoconstriction (27%; P less than 0.01) occurred posthypoperfusion in the no-drug condition. However, the magnitude of the posthypoperfusion vasoconstriction was not increased by cyclooxygenase inhibition, nor was it reduced by converting-enzyme inhibition. During halothane anesthesia, pulmonary vasoconstriction was not observed posthypoperfusion in the no-drug condition, but it was unmasked (8-13%; P less than 0.05) by cyclooxygenase inhibition and attenuated partially by converting-enzyme inhibition. These results indicate that cyclooxygenase metabolites and angiotensin II exert opposing vasodilator and vasoconstrictor effects, respectively, on the pulmonary circulation of conscious dogs posthypoperfusion. These competing mechanisms are active during halothane anesthesia but are abolished during pentobarbital anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Of 67 office workers 27 (40%) had documented tuberculin skin test conversions after an estimated 4-wk exposure to a coworker with cavitary tuberculosis. Worker complaints for more than 2 yr before the tuberculosis exposure prompted investigations of air quality in the building before and after the tuberculosis exposure. Carbon dioxide concentrations in many parts of the building were found to be above recommended levels, indicating suboptimal ventilation with outdoor air. We applied a mathematical model of airborne transmission to the data to assess the role of building ventilation and other transmission factors. We estimated that ventilation with outside air averaged about 15 feet 3/min (cfm) per occupant, the low end of acceptable ventilation, corresponding to CO2 levels of about 1,000 ppm. The model predicted that at 25 cfm per person 18 workers would have been infected (a 33% reduction) and at 35 cfm, a level considered optimal for comfort, that 13 workers would have been infected (an additional 19% reduction). Further increases in outdoor air ventilation would be impractical and would have resulted in progressively smaller increments in protection. According to the model, the index case added approximately 13 infectious doses (quanta) per hour (qph) to the office air during the exposure period, 10 times the average infectiousness reported in a large series of tuberculosis cases. Further modeling predicted that as infectiousness rises, ventilation would offer progressively less protection. We conclude that outdoor air ventilation that is inadequate for comfort may contribute to airborne infection but that the protection afforded to building occupants by ventilation above comfort levels may be inherently limited, especially when the level of exposure to infection is high.\r"

Ten guinea pigs received identical OA sensitization and challenges without capsaicin treatment, and four of eight nonsensitized controls received capsaicin followed by saline challenges. Capsaicin treatment did not alter antibody responses to OA as assessed by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, nor did it alter lipoxygenase products from OA-stimulated bronchial tissue in vitro. Capsaicin completely inhibited the increased pulmonary resistance (RL) to acetylcholine produced by repeated aerosolized OA, whereas it did not alter baseline RL or acetylcholine responses of controls. Capsaicin did not alter airway eosinophilia induced by repeated aerosolized OA. We conclude that neuropeptides play an important role in antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness without altering antibody levels, lipoxygenase mediator production, or airway eosinophilia.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrin deposition is a prominent finding in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Macrophages are found in increased numbers in RA synovium, and these cells are known to produce a variety of procoagulant and anticoagulant molecules. Using immunohistologic techniques, the content and distribution of several important components of the coagulation system in the synovium of patients with RA, osteoarthritis (OA), or traumatic joint abnormalities requiring surgery were investigated. Samples from 3 patients from each category were examined in detail. RA synovium (compared with that of patients with OA or joint trauma) had increased numbers of macrophages and increased expression/content of fibrinogen, tissue factor, factor XIII, tissue transglutaminase, cross-linked fibrin (fibrin D dimer), urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. Macrophage content in RA synovium was increased in both the lining cell areas and the interstitial cell areas. Fibrinogen was distributed throughout the tissue in all samples and was greater in RA synovium. In trauma and OA synovia, tissue factor was seen only in association with vessels (endothelial cells), but in RA synovium, it was markedly increased throughout the tissues. While fibrin D dimer was seen in small amounts in synovial lining cell areas of trauma and OA synovia, it was present in increased amounts in the lining cell and interstitial cell areas of RA synovium. Factor XIII and tissue transglutaminase were present in scant amounts in trauma and OA synovia, but there were increased amounts of both (especially tissue transglutaminase) in RA synovium in the vessel, lining cell, and interstitial cell areas. Urokinase and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor were also markedly increased in RA synovium. These results suggest that in inflamed synovium, there is ongoing extravascular tissue fibrin formation and dissolution that correlates with the degree of inflammation and macrophage content. Extravascular coagulation/fibrinolysis in RA represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied, in six normal subjects, the effect of nitrous oxide sedation on the ventilatory pattern and oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry (SpO2) after hyperventilation to an end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (PE'CO2) of 3 kPa. This value of PE'CO2 was shown to be less than the apnoeic threshold of all these subjects when their ventilation vs PE'CO2 response curves were plotted. All subjects became apnoeic when told to relax following hyperventilation while breathing 75% nitrous oxide for 90 s. Apnoea was defined as cessation of breathing for 20 s or more. The mean duration of apnoea was 78 s (range 29-130 s). All subjects demonstrated arterial desaturation (mean SpO2 75%, range 44-87%). In contrast, following hyperventilation with air, no apnoea was seen in any subject, although there was some evidence of desaturation (mean SpO2 92.5%, range 88-98%). It was concluded that subjects who are sedated with nitrous oxide behave similarly to those who are anaesthetized rather than to those who were fully conscious, in that they become apnoeic below the apnoeic threshold point. The reduction in SpO2 after hyperventilation was explained almost entirely by apnoea and may explain abnormalities of respiratory control and hypoxaemia in patients recovering from general anaesthesia or sedation accompanied by hypocapnia. This mechanism may be of importance in obstetric patients after breathing Entonox, when apnoea and hypoxaemia may reduce oxygen delivery to the fetus.\r"

  ".U": "91316263\r", 
  ".W": "The RBC Rh antigens are of large clinical importance, but until recently have been poorly understood at a molecular level. The Rh polypeptides are a family of nonglycosylated Mr 30- to 32-Kd transmembrane proteins that are core structural components of the Rh antigens and have been purified and partially characterized biochemically. Rh polypeptides are present in RBCs from normal humans and other mammalian species and are probably required for normal membrane integrity, because they appear to be missing from the RBCs of the rare Rhnull individuals that express several membrane defects. The Rh polypeptides contain an exofacial free sulfhydryl that is important for Rh antigenic reactivity and several intracellular sulfhydryls that appear to be palmitylated, but most of the molecule appears to reside between the leaflets of the phospholipid bilayer. The cDNA coding for a 416-amino acid Rh polypeptide was recently isolated but was not found to share sequence homology with any known protein, and Northern analysis indicated that Rh is erythroid specific. The Rh antigens within the native membranes are thought to exist as a complex of Rh polypeptides and multiple other membrane components, including certain Rh-related glycoproteins. While it is thought that this assembly may be important for the Rh antigenic reactivity, the structural basis of this remains to be established. While the physiologic role of Rh is yet to be defined, several clues indicate that it may play a role in the organization of membrane phospholipids or synthesis or membrane expression of various glycoproteins. While our knowledge of Rh is still very incomplete, recent research has significantly advanced the molecular understanding of these important blood group antigens.\r"

  ".U": "91316282\r", 
  ".W": "The present study examined the effects of the androgen steroid, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on murine T-cell production of a number of lymphokines. Direct exposure of murine T cells to DHT in vitro was found to reduce the amount of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and gamma-interferon (gamma IFN) produced after activation with anti-CD3 without affecting the production of IL-2. Exposure of T cells to either androstenedione or testosterone (the metabolic precursors of DHT) affected no change in the biosynthesis of either of these lymphokines. We have determined that macrophages possess 5 alpha-reductase, and are thus competent to metabolize testosterone to DHT. This physicochemical information is complemented by a functional analysis of macrophage metabolism of testosterone. By incubating bone marrow macrophages with testosterone, before their use as accessory cells, the IL-4 and IL-5 producing potential of the activated T cells cocultured with them was depressed. That the observed effect was mediated by the conversion of testosterone to DHT was further corroborated by illustrating that the inhibition of IL-4 production was abrogated if 4MA, a specific 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, was added to macrophage cultures containing testosterone. The biologic role of DHT in lymphokine and immune response regulation in vivo was addressed using several lines of investigation. First, transdermal delivery of DHT to groups of mice altered the capacity of T cells residing in the draining lymph nodes, only, to produce lymphokines. Second, treatment of either aged mice or the T cells isolated from them with a combination of dehydroepiandrosterone and DHT restored the capacity of their T cells to produce IL-2, IL-4, and gamma IFN to levels equivalent to that of younger mice. Finally, we observed a difference between males and females of a given age to produce IL-2, IL-4, and gamma IFN, with both IL-4 and gamma IFN production being elevated in females. Collectively, our findings indicate that DHT, similar to other steroid hormones, may play an important role in lymphokine regulation in vivo.\r"

DESIGN--Simultaneous measurement of echogenicity of flowing blood and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood samples and comparison of results. SETTING--A radiological department in a university hospital. SUBJECTS--83 patients with a suspected venous thrombosis and 36 healthy volunteers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Correlations between the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, packed cell volume, and echogenicity of flowing blood. RESULTS--Blood echogenicity correlated poorly with the packed cell volume, but strongly correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (when the packed cell volume was within reference limits) (correlation coefficient = 0.73). Blood samples with a greatly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate were highly echogenic. Only one of the 30 samples with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate below 10 mm in first hour had a higher echogenicity than the least echogenic sample of the 19 with a sedimentation rate above 30 mm in first hour. CONCLUSIONS--Echogenicity of flowing blood correlates with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and its measurement may compete with conventional methods for evaluating the long term changes in acute phase reactions. Also, it has the added advantage that non-invasive in vivo measurements of blood echogenicity may become possible.\r"

  ".W": "Using microelectrode techniques we compared the effects of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 2-3 microM), DL-propranolol (1-3 micrograms/ml), and flecainide acetate (10-15 microM) on isolated canine ventricular epicardial (epicardium) and endocardial (endocardium) tissues. Propranolol, TTX, and flecainide decreased Vmax and phase 0 amplitude in a use-dependent manner in both tissues. The effects of propranolol were slow to develop and wash out. TTX and propranolol always abbreviated action potential duration in endocardium. Action potential duration was abbreviated by 23.8 +/- 5.6 msec after propranolol (1 microgram/ml, basic cycle length [BCL] = 1,000 msec) and 10.8 +/- 12.9 msec after TTX (2 microM, BCL = 1,000 msec). In epicardium, the reduction of phase 0 and 1 amplitudes led to a slowing of the second action potential upstroke and an increase in the amplitude of phase 2. This accentuation of the notch resulted in a paradoxical prolongation of the epicardial action potential. Action potential duration was prolonged 34.4 +/- 11.3 msec after 4 hours of exposure to propranolol (1 microgram/ml, BCL = 1,000 msec), 11.1 +/- 6.3 msec after 15 minutes of exposure to TTX (2 microM, BCL = 1,000 msec), and 19.9 +/- 8.2 msec after 25-45 minutes of exposure to flecainide (15 microM, BCL = 500 msec). With stronger sodium block, phase 1 terminated at more negative potentials, the second upstroke often failed to appear, and an all-or-none repolarization ensued causing a marked abbreviation of the epicardial action potential. In some epicardial preparations, we observed marked abbreviation at some sites but prolongation at other sites after sodium blockade with flecainide. The dispersion of repolarization was often attended by reentrant activity. The differential response of epicardium and endocardium to sodium blockade was not observed when the preparations were pretreated with 4-aminopyridine or ryanodine, agents known to diminish the transient outward current and epicardial notch. Acceleration-induced prolongation of refractoriness was observed after sodium blockade in epicardium but not in endocardium. Postrepolarization refractoriness also occurred in epicardium but not in endocardium after TTX, propranolol, or flecainide exposure. The data indicate that propranolol, TTX, and flecainide, via their action to block sodium current, may exert opposite effects on action potential duration and refractoriness in cells spanning the ventricular wall. The presence of the transient outward current in epicardium but not in endocardium appears to contribute importantly to these differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The functional integrity of the beta- and alpha-adrenergic stimulatory pathways in a rapid ventricular pacing model of congestive heart failure in dogs was investigated; normal dogs served as controls. Total beta-adrenergic receptor density was 35% lower (p less than 0.01) in the pacing-overdrive dogs, and the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase (Vmax) was found to be 68% and 72% lower (p less than 0.01) in the left and right ventricles of the paced dogs. In addition, the basal adenylate cyclase activity was found to be 56% and 68% lower (p less than 0.01) in the left and right ventricles of the failing heart. Similarly, the Vmax of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) and forskolin stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity was significantly lower, 70% and 55%, respectively (p less than 0.01), in both ventricles of the paced dogs. However, although the concentration yielding half-maximal velocity for beta-agonist and GppNHp stimulation of adenylate cyclase was similar in both groups, that for forskolin stimulation of the enzyme was significantly increased (p less than 0.01). Pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of membranes from control and failing hearts revealed a significant decrease in the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein content (48 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01) in the hearts of the paced dogs. Moreover, although the pertussis toxin treatment increased the basal and the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in both normal and failing heart membranes, the adenylate cyclase activity remained significantly depressed in the failing heart after pertussis toxin treatment (p less than 0.01). Consistent with the depressed adenylate cyclase activity, mechanical studies on isolated papillary muscles and trabeculae revealed a decrease in baseline total tension (from 7.0 +/- 0.7 to 3.8 +/- 0.4 g/mm2, p less than 0.01) and dT/dt (from 26 +/- 8 to 13 +/- 1 g/mm2/sec, p less than 0.01) in the pacing-overdrive model. Tension generation and dT/dt observed in the paced dogs in response to increasing concentrations of forskolin demonstrated a rightward shift in the dose-response curve and a decrease in maximal forskolin stimulation (p less than 0.01). Similarly, maximal tension and dT/dt in the presence of isoproterenol was significantly lower than in the normal dogs (p less than 0.01). The decrease in beta-adrenergic responsiveness was accompanied by a decrease and rightward shift in alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness (increase in tension was 1.1 +/- 0.1 g/mm2 in paced dogs versus 2.1 +/- 0.1 g/mm2 in controls, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate the mediator(s) of endothelium-dependent arterial constrictor responses evoked by arachidonic acid in vitro. A segment of descending rabbit thoracic aorta was isolated and perfused (1-2 ml/min) with oxygenated Krebs' bicarbonate buffer. Changes in the vascular smooth muscle-contracting activity of the aortic effluent were detected by superfusion bioassay using either strips of rabbit aorta or rings of dog saphenous vein, both denuded of endothelium and exposed to indomethacin (10 microM). Arachidonic acid (5-50 micrograms) injected into the inflow of the perfused aorta caused a dose-related increase in the vascular smooth muscle-contracting activity of the aortic effluent, whereas arachidonic acid added directly into the aortic effluent did not. The arachidonic acid-induced elevation of vascular smooth muscle-contracting activity in the aortic effluent was not apparent when indomethacin (10 microM) was added to the aortic inflow to inhibit cyclooxygenase, when the endothelium of the perfused aorta was removed by rubbing, or when the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptors of the vascular tissues used for bioassay were blocked with an antagonist (1 microM SQ29548), and was unaffected when an inhibitor of thromboxane synthase (10 microM CGS 13080) was added to the aortic inflow. This effect of arachidonic acid was accompanied by release of prostaglandin H2 (measured as prostaglandin F2 alpha after reduction with SnCl2) in amounts sufficient to elicit contraction of the vascular tissues used for bioassay and was attenuated when a reducing agent (2 mM FeCl2) that converts prostaglandin H2 to 12-heptadecatrienoic acid was added to the aortic effluent. Collectively, these observations suggest that arachidonic acid stimulates endothelium-dependent release from the perfused aorta of a prostanoid that contracts vascular smooth muscle via interaction with thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptors. The study also suggests that the prostanoid responsible for the vascular smooth muscle-contracting activity of the aortic effluent is a prostaglandin endoperoxide(s) rather than thromboxane A2.\r"

  ".W": "To study synthesis, storage, and secretion of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the heart, we have measured BNP mRNA and BNP concentrations in the hearts of Wistar-Kyoto rats and also have investigated its secretion from the isolated perfused heart. The atrium expressed the BNP gene at a high level, and a considerable amount of BNP mRNA also was present in the ventricle, which corresponded to approximately 40% of the atrial BNP mRNA concentration. When tissue weight was taken into account, the total content of BNP mRNA in the ventricle was approximately threefold larger than that in the atrium, although the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA content in the ventricle was only 7% of that in the atrium. By contrast, the BNP concentration in the ventricle was 4.07 +/- 0.97 pmol/g, which was less than 1% of that in the atrium (451 +/- 86 pmol/g). The basal secretory rate of BNP from the isolated perfused whole heart was 49.3 +/- 6.1 fmol/min, approximately 60% of which was maintained even after atrial removal, whereas the secretory rate of ANP was reduced to less than 5%. We also studied age-matched spontaneously hypertensive rats-stroke prone. The rank order of the BNP mRNA concentration in the hearts of these rats was left ventricle greater than right ventricle greater than right atrium = left atrium, and the total BNP mRNA content and BNP secretory rate in the ventricle were twice as large as in Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results demonstrate that BNP is a novel cardiac hormone in rats and is predominantly synthesized in and secreted from the ventricle. This is in striking contrast to ANP, which occurs mainly in the atrium. The results also suggest possible pathophysiological roles of BNP in certain cardiovascular disorders.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The potential benefits of combination thrombolytic agents in the treatment of myocardial infarction remain uncertain. In a small pilot study, we demonstrated that combining half-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) with streptokinase (SK) achieved a high rate of infarct vessel patency and a low rate of reocclusion at half the cost of full-dose t-PA. METHODS AND RESULTS. We designed a prospective trial in which 216 patients were randomized within 6 hours of myocardial infarction to receive either the combination of half-dose (50 mg) t-PA with streptokinase (1.5 MU) during 1 hour or to the conventional dose of t-PA (100 mg) during 3 hours. Acute patency was determined by angiography at 90 minutes, and angioplasty was reserved for failed thrombolysis. Heparin and aspirin regimens were maintained until follow-up catheterization at day 7. Acute patency was significantly greater after t-PA/SK (79%) than with t-PA alone (64%, p less than 0.05). After angioplasty for failed thrombolysis, acute patency increased to 96% in both groups. Marked depletion of serum fibrinogen levels occurred after t-PA/SK compared with t-PA alone at 4 hours (37 +/- 36 versus 199 +/- 66 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001) and persisted 24 hours after therapy (153 +/- 66 versus 252 +/- 75 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001). Reocclusion (3% versus 10%, p = 0.06), reinfarction (0% versus 4%, p less than 0.05), and need for emergency bypass surgery (1% versus 6%, p = 0.05) tended to be less in the t-PA/SK group. Greater myocardial salvage was apparent in the t-PA/SK group as assessed by infarct zone function at day 7 (-1.9 SD/chord versus -2.3 SD/chord after t-PA alone, p less than 0.05). In-hospital mortality (6% versus 4%) and serious bleeding (12% versus 11%) were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that a less expensive regimen of half-dose t-PA with SK yields superior 90-minute patency and left ventricular function and a trend toward reduced reocclusion compared with the conventional dose of t-PA.\r"

  ".U": "91316821\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The output of carbon dioxide (VCO2) is controlled by both hemodynamics and ventilation. To understand VCO2 in patients who have chronic heart failure (CHF), we studied 14 patients who had New York Heart Association functional class III failure by measurements of hemodynamics, ventilation, and arterial and venous blood gases at rest and at 50 W of cycle ergometry exercise. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fick principle analysis of VCO2 showed that because of a limited increase in cardiac output, CHF patients widened their venoarterial CO2 content difference from 4.9 +/- 3.5 ml/dl at rest to 11.1 +/- 4.0 ml/dl with exercise (p less than 0.05). This increase in CO2 content difference was achieved with no change in venous CO2 content (from 54.3 +/- 3.3 ml/dl at rest to 54.5 +/- 4.8 ml/dl at exercise, p = NS); however, there was a decrease of arterial CO2 content (from 49.4 +/- 3.7 ml/dl at rest to 43.4 +/- 2.3 ml/dl with exercise, p less than 0.05). Modeling of the CO2 tension-content relation showed that there would have been a small, nonproportional increase of venous CO2 content as venous CO2 tension increased from 43.2 +/- 1.8 mm Hg at rest to 55.3 +/- 4.2 mm Hg during exercise (p less than 0.05); however, the development of metabolic acidosis during exercise entirely blunted the increase of CO2 content. In contrast, both the shape of the tension-content relation and the acidosis of exercise further influenced the decrease of arterial CO2 content as arterial CO2 tension decreased from 37.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg at rest to 32.0 +/- 3.4 mm Hg during exercise (p less than 0.05) as a result of excess ventilation. CONCLUSIONS. In CHF patients during exercise, the circulatory limitations imposed by a low cardiac output on VCO2 are compensated by a widened venoarterial CO2 content difference. The content difference is not widened through an increase of venous CO2 content but rather by a decrease of arterial CO2 content caused by arterial hypocapnia and metabolic acidosis.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the significance of glycation, nonenzymatic browning, and oxidation of lens crystallins in cataract formation in elderly diabetic patients, we measured three distinct products of glycation, browning, and oxidation reactions in cataractous lens crystallins from 29 diabetic patients (mean +/- SD age 72.8 +/- 8.8 yr) and 24 nondiabetic patients (age 73.5 +/- 8.3 yr). Compounds measured included 1) fructoselysine (FL), the first stable product of glycation; 2) pentosidine, a fluorescent, carbohydrate-derived protein cross-link between lysine and arginine residues formed during nonenzymatic browning; and 3) N epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), a product of autoxidation of sugar adducts to protein. In diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients, there were significant increases (P less than 0.001) in HbA1 (10.2 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.1 +/- 0.7%), FL (7.6 +/- 5.4 vs. 1.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/mol lysine), and pentosidine (6.3 +/- 2.8 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.9 mumol/mol lysine). The disproportionate elevation of FL compared with HbA1 suggests a breakdown in the lens barrier to glucose in diabetes, whereas the increase in pentosidine is indicative of accelerated nonenzymatic browning of diabetic lens crystallins. CML levels were similar in the two groups (7.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 6.8 +/- 3.0 mmol/mol lysine), providing no evidence for increased oxidative stress in the diabetic cataract. Thus, although the modification of lens crystallins by autoxidation reactions was not increased in diabetes, the increase in glycation and nonenzymatic browning suggests that these processes may acclerate the development of cataracts in diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic experimental hyperglycemia mediated by galactose has been shown to induce browning and cross-linking of rat tail tendon collagen that could be duplicated in vitro by nonenzymatic galactosylation. To investigate the nature of these changes, Sprague-Dawley rats were placed on a 33% galactose diet without and with sorbinil for 6 and 12 mo. Collagen-linked fluorescence and pentosidine cross-links increased with age and galactosemia in tail tendons (P less than 0.001) and skin but were essentially unresponsive to aldose reductase inhibition (ARI). In contrast, tendon breaking time in urea, a likely parameter of cross-linking, was markedly improved (P less than 0.001) by ARI. Fluorescence that was inhibited by sorbinil treatment was increased in pepsin and proteinase K digest of aortic tissue from galactosemic rats (P less than 0.001), but impaired enzymatic digestibility was not observed. Systolic blood pressure as potential consequence of aortic stiffening was not increased in galactosemia. These data suggest that fluorescence in skin and tendon might be in part due to advanced glycosylation and pentosidine formation because these were not decreased by ARI. However, they also suggest that nonfluorescent cross-links may also be forming because, in contrast to fluorescence, tail tendon breaking time was partly corrected by ARI. Thus, it appears that extracellular matrix changes in chronic galactosemia are complex, being partly attributable to advanced glycosylation and partly to polyol-pathway activation.\r"

Secretory granules were incubated in a phosphorylation reaction mixture containing [32P]ATP and test reagents. The 32P-labeled proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 32P content was visualized by autoradiography, and the relative intensities of specific bands were quantitated. When the reaction mixture contained EGTA and no added Ca2+, 32P was incorporated into two proteins with molecular weights of 45,000 and 13,000. When 10(-4) M Ca2+ was added without EGTA, two additional proteins (58,000 and 48,000 Mr) were phosphorylated, and the 13,000-Mr protein was absent. The addition of 2.4 microM calmodulin markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of the 58,000- and 48,000-Mr proteins and resulted in the phosphorylation of a major protein whose molecular weight (64,000 Mr) is identical to that of one of the calmodulin binding proteins located on the granule surface. Calmodulin had no effect on phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+ but was effective in the presence of calcium between 10 nM and 50 microM. Trifluoperazine and calmidazolium, calmodulin antagonists, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the calmodulin effect. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, a phorbol ester that activates protein kinase C, produced no increase in phosphorylation, and 1-(5-isoquinoline sulfonyl)-2-methyl piperazine dihydrochloride, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, had no effect. These results indicate that Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and endogenous substrates are present in islet secretory granules.\r"

RHPA showed that the population of single beta-cells under study was stimulated (P less than 0.01-0.001) to secrete insulin by 16.7 mM glucose, 100 microM tolbutamide, 20 microM glyburide, or 30 mM KCl but, under these conditions, also comprised beta-cells that did not secrete detectable amounts of insulin. Under current clamp conditions, secreting and nonsecreting beta-cells showed analogous resting membrane potentials (approximately 60 mV) and were similarly depolarized by 30 mm KCl and 100 microM tolbutamide. Under voltage-clamp conditions, total membrane conductance (approximately 6 nS) was also similar in the glucose-responsive and -unresponsive beta-cells, which, when monitored in the whole-cell configuration after RHPA, showed the following currents: a voltage-dependent Na+ current, a voltage-activated Ba2+ current, a voltage-dependent K+ delayed-rectifier current, a voltage-dependent Ca(2+)-activated K+ current, and a voltage-independent and tolbutamide-sensitive K+ current. In the cell-attached configuration and the presence of 2.8 mM glucose, secreting and nonsecreting beta-cells displayed a similar single-channel activity that was abolished when glucose concentration was raised to 16.7 mM. We conclude that beta-cells studied after RHPA have an electrically normal membrane whether they release insulin in response to 16.7 mM glucose or not.\r"

When administered daily for 98 days at a dose of 25 mg/kg body wt i.p., both compounds lowered eye lens sorbitol and aldose reductase activity in normoglycemic and alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Again, diaminoguanidine was a better inhibitor. Daily long-term administration of mono- and diaminoguanidine (25 mg/kg body wt i.p.) inhibited and prevented experimental diabetes-induced lens opacity in rats, respectively. It appears that diaminoguanidine has a better therapeutic potential in controlling diabetic complications.\r"

DN was classified as absent (urinary albumin excretion [UAE] rate less than 15 microgram/min), incipient (UAE rate 15-200 micrograms/min), or clinical (UAE rate greater than 200 micrograms/min). We followed a cohort of 59 patients for a median of 3 yr. At baseline, 52 patients had no DN, 6 had incipient DN, and 1 had clinical DN. At follow-up, 38 patients had no DN (group 1). Incipient DN had developed in 14 patients and worsened in 3 patients. Clinical DN had worsened in 1 patient. Together, these 18 patients comprised group 2. A decrease in UAE was observed in the remaining three patients with incipient DN at baseline (group 3). In group 1, vWF--measured by immunoelectrophoresis and expressed as a percentage of normal--increased slightly (median 10%, range -43 to 145, P = 0.009). In group 2, vWF increased in all patients (median 80%, range -14 to -206, P = 0.0002 vs. baseline and group 1). In group 3, vWF decreased (median -19%, range -44 to -18). After correction for possible confounders, i.e., age, varying duration of follow-up, and initial level of vWF, the difference in vWF change between groups 1 and 2 remained significant (P = 0.009). Poor glycemic control at baseline, estimated by glycosylated hemoglobin, was a significant predictor of increases in vWF in both group 1 and groups 1 and 2 combined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The reaction products were analyzed by ethidium bromide staining in acrylamide gel and hybridization with a radiolabeled probe. Hepatitis C virus RNA was thereby detected in 17 of 27 (63%) liver tissue specimens obtained from patients with non-A, non-B chronic liver diseases. Of these 27 patients, viral RNA was detected in 12 of 17 (71%) liver tissues from anti-hepatitis C virus-positive patients and in 5 of 10 (50%) liver tissues from anti-hepatitis C virus-negative patients. Direct sequencing of amplified complementary DNA (35 nucleotides) of the 17 RNA-positive samples showed only 66% to 77% homology to the reported hepatitis C virus complementary DNA sequence. These results indicate that the majority of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive patients are currently infected with hepatitis C virus, and some of the anti-hepatitis C virus-negative patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis are harboring hepatitis C virus in the liver. Detection of hepatitis C virus RNA appears to provide a useful indicator in the study of hepatitis C virus infection.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental studies have shown that interleukin-6 induces all major acute-phase proteins in the liver, including C-reactive protein. In 50 patients with acute pancreatitis, the serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were determined daily during the first week of hospitalization. Patients were divided into three groups according to clinical criteria: mild pancreatitis (less than or equal to 1 complication; n = 25), severe pancreatitis (greater than or equal to 2 complications; n = 15), and lethal outcome (n = 10). Patients with mild disease showed initially slightly elevated levels of interleukin-6 (22.0 +/- 9.8 U/mL) that decreased to low levels within 4 days (5.0 +/- 1.0 U/mL). In patients with severe pancreatitis, serum concentrations of interleukin-6 were initially clearly elevated (35.0 +/- 7.5 U/mL) and remained slightly elevated until day 7 (13.0 +/- 2.0 U/mL). Patients with lethal outcome had markedly elevated initial interleukin-6 concentrations (61.0 +/- 15.0 U/mL) that decreased but were still elevated at day 7 (26.0 +/- 2.5 U/mL). In all three groups, C-reactive protein concentrations followed the course of interleukin-6 concentrations by 1 day. There was a positive correlation between maximal interleukin 6 concentrations and maximal increases in the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (r = 0.66). At days 1 and 2, increased (greater than 15 U/mL) interleukin-6 concentrations (positive predictive value, 91%; negative predictive value, 82%) predicted a severe or lethal course of the disease more accurately than elevated [greater than 0.10 g/L (greater than 10 mg/dL)] C-reactive protein concentrations (positive predictive value, 67%; negative predictive value, 79%). In conclusion, elevated serum concentrations of interleukin-6 followed by increased levels of C-reactive protein reflect the severity of acute pancreatitis.\r"

In this study, we report that liver macrophages from rats treated with lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg, intravenous) also kill certain tumor cell targets by phagocytosis. Liver macrophages were coincubated with P815 mouse mastocytoma cells for 24 to 72 hr at an effector/target ratio of 10:1. Macrophage phagocytosis was characterized by flow cytometry and by light and electron microscopy. For flow-cytometric studies, P815 cells were prelabeled with the fluorescent dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate. We found that coincubation of macrophages with labeled targets resulted in a time-dependent increase in macrophage-associated fluorescence, reaching a maximum at 72 hr. This correlated with light-microscopic observations of increased numbers of tumor cells in the macrophages and enhanced macrophage surface area and density. Electron microscopic studies revealed that the initial event in the phagocytic process involved the capture of P815 cells by the pseudopodia of the macrophages. Target cells were then surrounded by lamellipodia, internalized in phagosomes and destroyed. These data, together with previous studies, provide evidence for multiple mechanisms of cytotoxicity mediated by activated liver macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of the present study was to characterize the new renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, Ro 42-5892 inhibited purified human renin and human plasma renin specifically with an IC50 of 0.7 nM and 0.8 nM, respectively. In vivo, Ro 42-5892 reduced mean arterial blood pressure in sodium-depleted marmosets and squirrel monkeys with as low a dose as 0.1 mg/kg orally. Higher doses reduced pressure by 30-35 mm Hg in both species. The duration of blood pressure decrease with 3 mg/kg orally was more than 24 hours. Maximal changes of plasma renin activity, immunoreactive angiotensin I, and immunoreactive angiotensin II were observed at 15 minutes. Renin was reduced by 74 +/- 31%, angiotensin I by 85 +/- 14%, angiotensin II by 89 +/- 17%, and immunoreactive active renin was increased by 70 +/- 39%. However, unlike pressure, these maximal effects were only transient with complete recovery of renin at 60 minutes under still reduced levels of angiotensin I (61 +/- 24%) and angiotensin II (71 +/- 38%) and increased concentrations of active renin (86 +/- 30%). The blood pressure lowering was due to specific renin inhibition as exemplified by the influence of the kidney, sodium status, species, or stereoselectivity. Moreover, the reduction of arterial blood pressure was similar to the action of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril and was not associated with reflex tachycardia in contrast to the pure vasodilator minoxidil. We conclude that Ro 42-5892 is a potent orally active renin inhibitor acting mainly by inhibition of renin in an extraplasmatic compartment.\r"

  ".W": "Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that can cause chronic life-threatening diarrhea in immunocompromised persons. Host immune responses are poorly understood, an impediment to development of effective therapy. In mice, normal adult BALB/c animals resist infection whereas chronic symptomatic cryptosporidiosis develops in adult nude mice and in neonatally infected BALB/c mice treated with anti-CD4 mAb. To define further the immune defects that allow mice to be infected with Cryptosporidium, adult BALB/c mice were treated with cytolytic anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 or with neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma or anti-IL-2 mAb. Chronic infection, manifested by continuous shedding of sparse but statistically significant numbers of oocysts, occurred with anti-CD4 +/- anti-CD8 mAb treatment although anti-CD8 mAb treatment alone did not allow infection. Treatment with anti-IFN-gamma mAb greatly enhanced oocyst shedding but infection was self-limited. Treatment with a combination of anti-CD4 and anti-IFN-gamma mAb permitted both chronic infection and shedding of large numbers of oocysts. Furthermore mice treated initially with anti-CD4 mAb showed a substantial increase in oocyst shedding when later treated with anti-IFN-gamma mAb; and mice treated initially with both mAbs showed a decline in oocyst shedding when anti-IFN-gamma mAb was stopped. Anti-IFN-gamma mAb treatment of congenitally athymic adult BALB/c mice led to an approximately a 75-fold increase in oocyst shedding. Treatment of adult BALB/c mice with anti-IL-2 mAb did not permit Cryptosporidium infection. These results suggest that redundant immunologic mechanisms limit Cryptosporidium infection such that both CD4+ cells and IFN-gamma are required to prevent initiation of infection whereas either alone can limit the extent (IFN-gamma) or duration (CD4+ T cells) of infection. They also suggest that production of IFN-gamma by a non-T cell contributes to host immunity.\r"

Therefore, T cell stimulatory epitopes of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 38-kDa lipoprotein, of known structure and specificity and of prominent immunogenicity, have been examined. To identify potential T cell epitopes, eight peptides, seven of which were predicted to form amphiphatic helices, were used for immunization of various inbred mice and for elicitation of in vitro T cell proliferative responses. Three different response patterns were observed. 1) Lymph node cells from mice immunized with peptide, recombinant 38-kDa Ag, killed M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra, or live Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Guerin infection responded to peptide 38.G (residues 350 to 369). Responses were observed in mice of H-2b, H-2d, and H-2k haplotypes. 2) Peptide 38.C (residues 201 to 220) induced proliferation of lymph node cells from 38-kDa protein-, but not from peptide-immunized mice. 3) Peptide 38.F (residues 285 to 304) only elicited a response of the homologous peptide-primed cells. Analysis of CD4+ T cell lines confirmed the distinct specificities and stimulatory features of peptides 38.F and 38.G. The described attributes of peptide 38.C and 38.G could be of potential interest for diagnostic evaluation in tuberculous infections.\r"

  ".U": "91318148\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with kappa L chain expressing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) frequently have leukemia cells reactive with a murine mAb, designated 17.109. Raised against a monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor autoantibody, this mAb recognizes a major kappa-L chain-associated cross reactive Id, designated 17.109-CRI. Molecular studies reveal that the 17.109-CRI in CLL is a serologic marker for expression of a conserved kappa L chain V region gene (V Kappa gene) of the V Kappa 3 subgroup, designated Humkv325. We isolated an upstream gene fragment of Humkv325 to examine for Ig gene rearrangements of this and other closely related V Kappa 3 genes by Southern analyses. Consistent with Humkv325 encoding the 17.109-CRI, we find that the genomic DNA from all 17.109-reactive leukemia cell populations have gene rearrangements that are detected using this probe. In addition, we observe V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements frequently in the genomic DNA of lambda L chain-expressing leukemia cells. Of the genomic DNA from 33 lambda-L chain-expressing CLL samples, 8 (24%) had additional nongerm-line bands detected with the Humkv325 probe. Consistent with these bands representing Ig gene rearrangements, the additional band in each but one sample also hybridized with probes specific for the J Kappa region and/or the kappa-deleting element. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we examined the genomic DNA from all lambda L chain-expressing CLL for V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements to J Kappa and/or Kde. PCR on each DNA sample with V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements detected by Southern analysis generated gene fragments that hybridized specifically with oligonucleotides corresponding to framework or CDR of the Humkv325 gene. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of representative samples confirmed that these DNA contained abortive Humkv325 gene rearrangements. PCR for rearranged V Kappa 3 genes in the DNA of other lambda-L chain-expressing CLL either did not generate any PCR product or produced fragments that failed to hybridize with all Humkv325 oligonucleotide probes. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the latter demonstrated that these represent abortive V Kappa gene rearrangements involving another conserved V Kappa 3 gene, designated Vg. These studies indicate that Humkv325 and Vg frequently may undergo Ig gene rearrangement independent of their expression. As such, the frequent use of Humkv325 in CLL may be secondary, in part, to an enhanced propensity of this V Kappa 3 gene to undergo genetic rearrangement during B cell ontogeny.\r"

The repertoire of alpha beta and gamma delta cells is shaped first by genetic processes that control rearrangement and expression and then by intercellular processes that \"select\" cells expressing only particular receptors. In this report, alpha chain transcripts from different stages of ontogeny were examined to determine the influence of V and J gene location on the thymic repertoire. J alpha gene segments were not used equally by V alpha genes. The frequency of J alpha use, and thus the alpha chain repertoire, was influenced by at least three factors: the location of the V gene, the location of the J gene, and the age of the animal. V genes that are proximal to the J alpha region preferentially use the most 5' J alpha gene segments. In contrast, a V alpha gene that is distal to the J alpha region was rarely joined to these same 5' J alpha gene segments in thymocytes from adult animals. We suggest that the data are most easily explained by the frequent occurrence of secondary rearrangements in which a V alpha J alpha rearranged gene would be replaced by the joining of a flanking V alpha gene to a flanking J alpha gene segment. Finally, the evidence suggests that there may be differences in the extent of secondary rearrangements between fetal and adult animals.\r"

  ".W": "In the mouse, two sets of V beta gene products have been shown to be associated with T cell recognition of endogenous self Ag. One of these is the set of V beta associated with T cell reactivities to stimulatory Mls gene products, Mlsa (V beta 6, V beta 8.1, V beta 9) or Mlsc (V beta 3); another is the set of V beta, such as V beta 5, V beta 11, V beta 12, or V beta 17a, which were originally found to be related to I-E recognition. Although the Mls system has been well characterized, little is known about the nature of the ligands for the second set of V beta. In this work, we describe the evidence that the natural ligand or ligands of V beta 5, V beta 11, and V beta 12 may be novel Mls determinants that are recognized by naive T cells at a high precursor frequency and function as the ligand for clonal deletion of self-reactive T cells by negative selection. However, surprisingly, unlike the conventional Mls system, in which all V beta associated with Mlsa recognition or Mlsc recognition are uniformly deleted in those animals expressing the relevant Mls type, expression of these three V beta segregates independently among strains. Based on these observations, the nature of T cell recognition for this new Mls gene product(s) is discussed.\r"

To this end, resting peripheral human T lymphocytes were preincubated with 32P-orthophosphate and subsequently exposed to mitogenic mAb directed at either TCR/CD3 or CD2 for varying time periods. Cells were lysed and postnuclear lysates subjected to two-dimensional-gel electrophoresis (IEF and SDS-PAGE). As early as 10 min after stimulation through CD2, dephosphorylation of a cytosolic 19-kDa protein was observed. In contrast, this protein remained phosphorylated in unstimulated as well as CD3 activated T cells. Phosphoprotein (pp) 19 dephosphorylation was transient because, at later time points (2-4 h) after CD2 triggering, this protein was phosphorylated again. Phosphoaminoacid analysis indicated that pp19 is dephosphorylated on serine residues. Identical results were obtained using a CD2+ but TCR/CD3- human NK cell clone indicating that pp19 dephosphorylation occurs independent of surface expression of a TCR/CD3 complex. These data show that, in addition to protein phosphorylation events, serine dephosphorylation is involved in T cell triggering. More important, a selective signaling mechanism appears to be linked to T cell activation through the CD2 pathway.\r"

As previous investigators have examined the T cell cytokine profile from immunized animals, we examined whether Th1 or Th2 type T cells could be identified in the peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune compartments from subjects with or without inflammatory diseases. Using limiting dilution analysis and growth with PHA and IL-2/IL-4, we directly cloned a total of 177 T cells from the peripheral blood and CSF of seven subjects, four with inflammatory disease and three control subjects, and examined the cytokine message profile after stimulation with ionomycin and PMA. We found that most clones from both the peripheral blood and CSF express IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha cytokine mRNA after activation with ionomycin and PMA. All T cell clones tested produced TNF-alpha mRNA, and all but 14 produced IFN-gamma mRNA. As reported previously, Th0 cells, which produced IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 mRNA, were found in most subjects. In striking contrast, Th1 cells, which expressed IL-2 and IFN-gamma but not IL-4 or IL-5 mRNA, were present in both peripheral blood and CSF of subjects with inflammatory disease but not found in peripheral blood or CSF of subjects without systemic inflammation. Th2 cells, expressing IL-4 and IL-5 but not IFN-gamma or IL-2 mRNA, were not found in any subject. These data present the first evidence for Th1 T cell clones in humans that may be associated with systemic inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocyte infiltration is a well documented feature of classical delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recently, we have shown that T lymphocytes and activated (EG2+) eosinophils accumulate in the allergen-induced late phase skin reaction (LPR). To compare the kinetics and phenotypic composition of these T lymphocyte responses, LPR and DTH reactions of comparable induration size were induced in atopic subjects. In addition, DTH and LPR were compared between atopic and nonatopic subjects. In atopic individuals, allergen challenge elicited a perivascular influx of T lymphocytes that was predominantly CD4+. Eosinophil accumulation and activation were also prominent. There was no cellular response to allergen challenge in the nonatropic group. In both groups, DTH responses showed an intense T cell infiltrate which was more dense and dispersed than in the LPR. CD4+ T cells predominated but at 48 h CD8+ numbers were also significantly increased. In DTH, total leukocyte numbers (CD45+) were increasing at 48 h, whereas in the LPR, cell numbers reached a plateau between 24 and 48 h. T cell activation (shown by expression of IL-2R) was more prominent in DTH. Endothelial expression of HLA-DR was increased in both LPR and DTH, implying the local release of inflammatory cytokines in both reactions. Small but significant numbers of activated eosinophils (EG2+) were detected in atopics and non-atopics at 24 h in DTH but not at 48 h. These findings suggest that the allergen-induced LPR induced in atopic subjects is, at least in part, a form of cell-mediated hypersensitivity but with T cell kinetics that differ from classical DTH.\r"

  ".W": "Triggering of the CD3:TCR complex by optimal concentrations of anti-CD3, anti-TCR beta-chain, and allogeneic stimulator cells induced dramatically higher levels (fivefold for anti-CD3, greater than 10-fold for anti-TCR beta-chain, 84-fold for alloantigen) of IL-2 production in spleen CD4+8- T cells than their thymic counterparts, despite comparable levels of CD3 and TCR beta-chain expression. The nature of the reduced IL-2 production was examined by analysis of anti-CD3-induced IL-2 production at the single cell level. The frequency of IL-2-producing cells in spleen CD4+8- T cells (40.0%) was approximately threefold that of thymus CD4+8- T cells (14.5%). Furthermore, the average IL-2 levels among positive IL-2 producers was also approximately threefold higher in spleen CD4+8- T cells than their thymic counterparts. Adoptive transfer of purified Thy-1.2+ CD4+8- T cells into Thy-1.1-congenic hosts provided a physiologic and histocompatible system that enabled identification of transferred donor (Thy-1.2+) among a sea of host (Thy-1.2-) CD4+ T cells, whose immune function with respect to IL-2 inducibility was examined after isolation by electronic cell sorting. Donor CD4+ T cells thus isolated from host spleen shortly (1 day) after i.v. transfer of thymus CD4+8- T cells were similar to freshly isolated thymus CD4+8- T cells in that they both produced little IL-2 in response to anti-CD3. However, by day 3 post-transfer, IL-2 production by donor CD4+8- T cells had more than doubled and by day 8, they produced IL-2 levels comparable to those of host spleen CD4+8- T cells. A similar acquisition of high level IL-2 inducibility in thymus CD4+8- T cells upon i.v. transfer into Thy-1.1-congenic hosts was also observed using allogeneic cells as the stimulus of IL-2 production. When thymus CD4+8- T cells were intra-thymically transferred into Thy-1.1-congenic hosts, those donor cells that emigrated to the periphery became high IL-2 producers in a time-dependent manner, whereas those that remained inside the thymus showed no signs of up-regulation in IL-2 inducibility. Intrathymic transfer of CD4-8- thymocytes revealed that the most recent thymic emigrant CD4+8- T cells contained few IL-2-producing cells and were not functionally mature with respect to high level IL-2 inducibility.\r"

The various cell subpopulations at defined developmental stages were isolated by electronic cell sorting and examined for mitogen induced IL-2 production and cell proliferation responses. For TCR-alpha beta-bearing CD4+8+ and CD4+8low thymocytes that are actively engaged in positive and negative selection processes, negligible to low levels of IL-2 production and cell proliferation were observed in response to TCR:CD3 triggering or to the combined activation of protein kinase C and calcium mobilization mediated by PMA and ionomycin, respectively. For CD4-8- TCR-alpha beta early thymocytes that have not yet entered the selection process, PMA + ionomycin induced significant cell proliferation but little IL-2 production, in the absence of added IL-1. However, addition of IL-1 caused a powerful induction of IL-2 production that was accompanied by increased cell proliferation. Triggering of the TCR:CD3 complex had no effect on CD4-8-TCR(-)-alpha beta thymocytes as they do not express detectable levels of TCR-alpha beta. For thymus CD4+8- Th cells, the first cells that have completed TCR repertoire selection, vigorous proliferation was observed in response to TCR:CD3 triggering in the presence of added IL-2. However, the development of IL-2 responsiveness was not accompanied by high level IL-2 inducibility as TCR:CD3 triggering caused only marginal IL-2 production. In contrast, spleen CD4+8- T cells, the most \"mature\" representatives of Th cells, expressed high levels of IL-2 production as well as IL-2 responsiveness in response to TCR:CD3-mediated stimulation. The lack of anti-TCR-induced IL-2 production by thymus CD4+8- T cells was not due to an intrinsic defect as high levels of IL-2 production was induced by PMA + ionomycin. Possible reasons for the temporal acquisition and differential control of IL-2 inducibility and IL-2 responsiveness are discussed in the context of established Th cell development pathway.\r"

  ".U": "91318171\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the regulation of the AP-1 transcription complex in the IL-1-responsive murine T cell thymoma cell line EL-4 6.1 C10. Our results demonstrate that AP-1-mediated gene expression in T cells may be regulated by several signaling pathways and factors, including IL-1, protein kinase C, protein kinase A (PKA), and one or more serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases. The activation of protein kinase C results in an increase in nuclear AP-1 DNA binding activity, as well as enhanced gene expression. IL-1 and agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels do not, by themselves, induce AP-1 activation, but they synergize with phorbol esters. IL-1 and forskolin may enhance AP-1 function by different mechanisms, because forskolin enhanced gene expression without producing an increase in nuclear AP-1 DNA binding, whereas IL-1 increased AP-1-binding activity and gene expression. These observations, in conjunction with the lack of a demonstrable effect of IL-1 on cAMP production in EL-4 cells, are consistent with the view that IL-1 enhances AP-1 activation by a pathway that does not directly involve cAMP and PKA. However, the induction of AP-1 activity by IL-1 and phorbol esters is dependent upon the presence of PKA, as evidenced by the loss of AP-1 inducibility in cells transfected with a cDNA encoding protein kinase inhibitor, a specific inhibitor of PKA. The effect of protein kinase inhibitor on AP-1 activation in response to IL-1 and tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate was reversed in the presence of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Thus, the level of AP-1 activity in T cells may be determined by the balance between the activities of several serine/threonine protein kinases and phosphatases.\r"

  ".U": "91318172\r", 
  ".W": "IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine that was identified on the basis of its ability to synergize with IL-2 in the induction of cytotoxic effector cells and was originally called cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor (CLMF). IL-12 was also found to stimulate the proliferation of PHA-activated lymphoblasts which were greater than 90% CD3+ T cells. In this report we further characterize the effects of IL-12 on lymphocyte proliferation. Studies with purified subpopulations of PHA-activated lymphoblasts and with cloned lines of human T cells indicated that IL-12 caused the proliferation of activated T cells of both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. This effect of IL-12 was independent of IL-2 because it was not blocked by antibodies to either IL-2 or IL-2R. The maximum proliferation induced by IL-12 was 31 to 72% of the maximum caused by IL-2; however, IL-12 was active at a lower effective concentration (EC50 = 8.5 +/- 1.3 pM) than IL-2 (EC50 = 52 +/- 8 pM). Combination of suboptimal amounts of IL-12 and IL-2 resulted in additive proliferation, up to the maximum induced by IL-2 alone. IL-12 also caused the proliferation of lymphocytes activated by culture with IL-2 for 6 to 12 days. CD56+ NK cells were among the IL-12-responsive cells in the IL-2-activated lymphocyte population. Unlike IL-2 or IL-7, IL-12 caused little or no proliferation of resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In this regard, IL-12 was similar to IL-4. However, IL-12 could enhance the proliferation of resting PBMC caused by suboptimal amounts of IL-2, whereas IL-4 inhibited IL-2-induced PBMC proliferation. Thus, IL-12 is a growth factor for activated human T cells and NK cells; however, its spectrum of lymphocyte growth-promoting properties is distinct from that of IL-2, IL-4, or IL-7.\r"

  ".W": "The development of LPS tolerance has been suggested to be mediated by an inhibition of cytokine synthesis. Here we have studied serum IL-6 and TNF levels in mice after LPS administration. Repeated administration of LPS (35 micrograms daily for 4 days) to mice induced a refractoriness (tolerance) to subsequent administrations of LPS in terms of induction of circulating IL-6 and TNF. To investigate the mechanism by which LPS down-regulates its own induction of cytokine synthesis and the relationship between IL-6 and TNF production, we attempted to revert the inhibition of IL-6 and TNF production using agents like PMA or IFN-gamma, previously reported to activate macrophage production of cytokines. Pretreatment with PMA (4 micrograms, 10 min before LPS) partially restored IL-6 production in LPS-tolerant mice given 2 micrograms LPS. On the other hand, PMA did not restore TNF induction in LPS-tolerant mice, even when administered with high doses of LPS (up to 200 micrograms). A similar reversal of LPS resistance to IL-6, but not TNF, induction by PMA was observed in genetically LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ mice. IFN-gamma also restored, although to a lesser extent than PMA, IL-6 production. However, unlike PMA, IFN-gamma could also partially restore TNF production in LPS-tolerant mice, although only when LPS was administered at high doses. By contrast with PMA, IFN-gamma was clearly more active in restoring TNF synthesis than that of IL-6. Similar results were obtained in genetically LPS-unresponsive C3H/HeJ mice. These data suggest that different mechanisms are implicated in the inhibition of IL-6 and TNF synthesis in LPS-tolerant mice and that part of this inhibition can be overcome by PMA or IFN-gamma.\r"

The reduced and alkylated chains were sequenced directly, identifying the L chain as lambda-subgroup II and the mu-H chain as subgroup III. The complete sequence of the VL region was determined by sequencing peptides generated by cleavage with Staphylococcus aureus protease, chymotrypsin, and trypsin.

Of a total of 60 cells examined, 47% responded to LPS (1 microgram/ml) with an increase in [Ca2+]i. Macrophages were heterogeneous with regard to the LPS response, with individual cells exhibiting single rapid and transient increases in [Ca2+]i, multiple transients, or slower and more sustained variations. In 62% of the responding cells, a second exposure to LPS elicited a [Ca2+]i rise, although usually to a slightly lower peak value. Thus, rapid desensitization to LPS does not occur in the majority of these macrophages. EGTA did not abolish the response of those cells that exhibited a single rapid transient in [Ca2+]i, indicating that the source of the initial [Ca2+]i rise was the intracellular stores. There was no obvious correlation between the type of response to LPS and the initial morphologic features (rounded vs polarized) of the cells. Our present work shows unequivocally that LPS induces increases in macrophage [Ca2+]i and, thereby, lends substantial support to the hypothesis that [Ca2+]i is a second messenger in LPS-mediated activation of the macrophage.\r"

  ".W": "Using Northern Blot analysis, the endogenous levels of IL-4 and IL-2 mRNA in the spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, and granulomatous livers of male CBA/J mice in the acute phase of infection with Schistosoma mansoni have been quantified. High levels of IL-4 mRNA were detected in all three tissues from infected mice, whereas none was detected in tissues from normal, uninfected, age-matched mice. Isolation of the granulomas from the livers of infected mice and subsequent extraction of total RNA from these lesions resulted in a 70-fold enrichment of IL-4 message compared with the whole, unseparated granulomatous liver tissue. Hence, the predominant source of the IL-4 mRNA detected in livers from infected mice appears to be the schistosome egg-induced granulomas within these livers. In contrast, IL-2 mRNA was never detected in any of these tissues from either infected or normal mice. Control experiments were performed that ruled out the possibility that this inability to detect IL-2 mRNA was due to a difference in the efficacy of the IL-4 and IL-2 probes or due to a selective lability of IL-2 message. These data imply that IL-4-producing, Th2 lymphocytes are active in and possibly integral to the granulomatous, delayed-type hypersensitivity response characteristic of this infection, and directly challenges the current hypothesis that delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are exclusively mediated by Th1 lymphocytes.\r"

Six groups of rats were fed three levels of 18:3(n-3) or fish oil, and the fatty acid composition of testis parenchyma lipids and prostaglandin (PG) I2 synthesis by tunica were determined after 12 wk. Levels of docosapentaenoic acid [22:5(n-6)], the major 22-carbon fatty acid in rat testis lipids, were significantly depressed compared with the control by both linolenic acid and fish oil; however, testis weights were not affected significantly. Arachidonic acid levels also were depressed significantly in testis lipids by dietary (n-3) fatty acids, but the decreases were not as pronounced as those observed in other tissues. The synthesis of PGI2 was significantly reduced compared with the control by (n-3) fatty acid feeding, but there were no differences among the experimental groups. Both 18:3(n-3) and the longer-chain (n-3) fatty acids from fish oil reduce levels of 20:4(n-6) and 22:5(n-6) in testis lipids and the capacity of the tunica to synthesize PGI2, but these fatty acids seem to cause no defect in testicular development as indicated by weight.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of dietary (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (sunflower oil) on pig adipocyte beta-adrenoreceptor and adenylate cyclase activity was examined. Two adipose sites (subcutaneous and perirenal) were compared. The existence of two affinity classes for beta-adrenoreceptors was evidenced. Adenylate cyclase stimulation by isoproterenol was higher in the perirenal fat than in the subcutaneous fat, in parallel to a higher beta-adrenoreceptor density. When sunflower oil was included in the diet, the adenylate cyclase response to beta-agonists was greater, particularly in perirenal fat, as was the affinity of the adrenoreceptors in their high affinity state. However, the number of beta-adrenoreceptors was lower, suggesting that these are spare receptors. Adenylate cyclase stimulation by 5'-guanylylimidophosphate also revealed site- and diet-specific variations indicating alterations at the Gs-protein level. The adenylate cyclase catalytic activity (reflected by the forskolin-stimulated response) in the control group was higher in the subcutaneous fat than in the perirenal fat. In the sunflower oil-fed pigs, the catalytic activity was greater in the perirenal fat relative to controls, leading to similar values in both adipose tissues of sunflower oil-fed pigs. This indicates that the cyclase catalytic subunit activity also depends on the anatomical site of the fat deposit and is influenced by the diet as well. Correlation between these changes in the adenylate cyclase system are discussed in relationship with alterations in the plasma membrane structure.\r"

Serum and brains were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 degrees C. Free amino acids in either serum or brain were not significantly different on d 8 as compared with d 4 of lactation. Increasing dietary protein quality or quantity increased concentrations of most essential amino acids in serum and brain. Changes in the concentrations of nonessential amino acids in serum or brain associated with increases in protein quality or quantity were variable. For all 16 amino acids measured, brain free amino acids were highly correlated with serum levels. In this experiment, pup growth varied from 0.3 g/d for the offspring of dams fed 11% wheat to 1.4 g/d for the offspring of dams fed 21% wheat + lysine + threonine.

In the Mg-deficient rats the percent composition of triglycerides in VLDL, LDL and HDL was elevated and that of protein was reduced. Although the proportion of cholesterol was reduced in LDL and HDL, that of phospholipid was decreased only in HDL. Magnesium deficiency induced a decrease in the percent composition of apolipoprotein (apo) E and a relative increase in the apo C for VLDL. In HDL from Mg-deficient rats, the proportion of apo AI was higher than normal, apo AIV was lower than normal and apo E was virtually absent. The percent composition of oleic and linoleic acids was increased but that of stearic and arachidonic acids was depressed in both VLDL and HDL derived from Mg-deficient rats compared with pair-fed controls. Whether these alterations in lipoprotein profile contribute to hyperlipoproteinemia or are the results of the metabolic changes that produce hyperlipoproteinemia remain to be determined.\r"

Selection against the threonine-imbalanced diet in favor of a protein-free diet was reversed when 2 or 4 nmol threonine was injected bilaterally into the prepyriform cortex. However, intake of the threonine-imbalanced diet was significantly increased only after injection of 2 nmol threonine. The reduced intake of the threonine-imbalanced diet, compared to the basal diet, after injection of 4 nmol threonine was not the result of an excess in the concentration of amino acid (or nitrogen) injected into the PPC because intake of the threonine-basal diet was not reduced when 4 nmol threonine was administered. Intake of the threonine-imbalanced diet was also increased after injection of 2 nmol threonine plus 2 nmol isoleucine but not after injections of 2 nmol isoleucine. The changes in food intake when an imbalanced diet is fed appear to be the result of at least two separable responses: recognition of a diet as having an amino acid imbalance, as indicated by dietary choice, and reduction in food intake. The results of this study indicate that changing the concentration of the dietary limiting amino acid in the prepyriform cortex influenced dietary selection and food intake separately.\r"

Reactions after the 18-month APDT vaccination were minimal in severity regardless of the vaccine previously received. Antibody responses to lymphocytosis-promoting factor and agglutinogens were more pronounced in DTP recipients; however, APDT recipients had a better serologic response to filamentous hemagglutinin, and responses to the 69K protein were equivalent. This APDT vaccine produces fewer reactions than the standard whole-cell DTP vaccine. The protective significance of the serologic responses to the APDT vaccine is unknown, but the greater response to filamentous hemagglutinin and equivalent response to the 69K protein compared with those to DTP vaccine seem promising.\r"

Serial evaluations included history and physical examination, chest radiographs, throat cultures for bacteria, and determinations of serum immunoglobulin levels and circulating immune complexes. At a mean follow-up age of 27 months, 19% of the children had serial throat cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the first positive culture was found at a mean age of 21 months. In three infants the initial P. aeruginosa isolates were mucoid. As determined by typing with a DNA probe, serial P. aeruginosa isolates from each patient were identical over time but were genetically distinct from isolates recovered from other patients. Of 11 infants with P. aeruginosa, nine (82%) had previous isolates of Staphylococcus aureus or Haemophilus influenzae; all had received prior antibiotic therapy. In comparison with other infants with CF, children with P. aeruginosa grown on serial throat cultures more frequently had daily cough (p less than 0.01), lower chest radiograph scores (p less than 0.05), and elevated levels of circulating immune complexes (p less than 0.01). None of the study infants had persistent hypogammaglobulinemia or hypergammaglobulinemia. We conclude that (1) S. aureus and H. influenzae remain the isolates most frequently recovered from infants with CF; (2) initial recovery of P. aeruginosa by throat culture is often preceded by the onset of chronic respiratory signs; (3) elevations of circulating immune complexes can occur early, often after the initial recovery of P. aeruginosa; and (4) early P. aeruginosa isolates are genetically distinct, demonstrating the lack of cross-colonization in this newborn population.\r"

  ".W": "We used a quantitative human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) culture method to determine whether there is a relationship between the amount of replicating virus in the blood of vertically infected children and the relatively short latency period before development of symptomatic disease in these children. HIV-1 titers were determined by end point dilution in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the plasma of 30 infected (CDC class P1 and P2), 36 indeterminate (CDC class PO), and 19 uninfected (CDC class P3) infants and children born to HIV-1 seropositive mothers. HIV-1 was recovered from 35 (90%) of 39 PBMC cultures and 23 (60%) of 38 plasma cultures of infected patients not receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mean HIV-1 titers tended to be higher in patients with more advanced disease (P2, D, E, or F: 1760 TCID/10(6) PBMC, 460 TCID/ml plasma) than in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients (P1; P2, A or C: 90 TCID/10(6) PBMC; 60 TCID/ml plasma). A poor correlation between HIV-1 titers and serum p24 antigen levels was found. No correlation was observed between viral titers and relative or absolute numbers of CD4 lymphocytes. Plasma virus titers were lower in 9 patients receiving zidovudine (ZDV) therapy (mean 2 TCID/ml) than in untreated patients of similar clinical status. The viral titers measured in the blood of vertically infected infants and children were on the same order of magnitude as the viral titers measured in HIV-infected adults. We conclude that the relatively rapid progression to symptomatic disease of the majority of vertically infected patients is not due to a higher load of replicating virus in blood.\r"

B lymphoblastoid cells infected with vaccinia virus vectors expressing HIV-1 gag gene products were combined with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells to detect circulating CTLs. Effector cells were defined by monoclonal antibody-mediated, complement-dependent cytolysis. Circulating HIV-1 gag-specific cytotoxic responses were detectable in 4 of 5 HIV-1-infected pediatric hemophilic patients, and were similar in magnitude to those previously described in adults. In contrast, circulating HIV-1 gag-specific cytolysis was detectible in only 3 of 12 vertically infected children. Depletion data revealed that the majority of detectible gag-specific cytolysis was CD8 T cell-mediated. No apparent relationships between CD4 T cell counts, CD8 T cells counts, or serum p24 antigen levels and CTL responses were seen. Deficient CTL development may, in part, explain the more rapid onset of symptomatic disease following vertical HIV infection.\r"

Current criteria for selection for this test include a blood Pb concentration (bPb) between 25 and 55 micrograms/dl and an erythrocyte protoporphyrin level greater than 35 micrograms/dl. To determine whether the eligibility criteria could be refined to a smaller group of patients, we compared bPb determinations obtained on the day of the LMT in 198 children with moderate Pb poisoning to the results of the LMT. We found that children with bPb less than 25 micrograms/dl were unlikely to respond to the test dose of calcium disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate with a Pb diuresis (24/25 patients had low urinary Pb excretion on the LMT). In contrast, 88% of children with bPb greater than or equal to 40 micrograms/dl were likely to excrete sufficient Pb to indicate the need for a full course of chelation. We conclude that the LMT is indicated for children with bPbs between 25 and 40 micrograms/dl. Children with bPb between 40 and 55 micrograms/dl may receive chelation therapy without having an LMT, if the performance of the LMT is not practical. Patients with levels less than 25 micrograms/dl should be followed clinically and removed from further Pb exposure.\r"

To study the long-term bio-effects of this mode of treatment on the immature animal we evaluated 30 New Zealand white rabbits at 7 weeks of age for weight, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and arterial blood pressure after which they underwent left nephrectomy. Each group of 5 rabbits received ESWL of varying levels (500 to 3,000 shock waves) to the remaining right kidney using the Northgate SD3 lithotriptor (spark gap mediated). One control group received no shock waves. At maturity (16 weeks) the aforementioned parameters were measured again, and the kidneys and any grossly abnormal adjacent organs were examined. We found no significant change in total animal growth, renal growth, renal function or perirenal organs in the post-ESWL groups versus the control group. All post-ESWL groups had an increase in mean arterial blood pressure versus the control group with 3 of 6 groups showing significant increases (p less than 0.05). Histological renal changes, seen at all energy levels of ESWL delivered, included interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomeruli destruction, capsular thickening, perivascular fibrosis and mild arteriole wall thickening. Changes were proportional to the number of shocks received. We conclude that ESWL delivered to immature animals does not significantly affect renal growth and function but it can cause significant permanent histological renal changes even at low doses and may result in an increase in adult mean arterial blood pressure.\r"

  ".U": "91318538\r", 
  ".W": "Perioperative monitoring has demonstrated that administration of heparin on an empirical basis is associated with a wide variation in patient response and elimination rate. This problem may be overcome by intervention on the basis of perioperative monitoring or by using forms of heparin with different pharmacokinetic properties. When compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin has a higher bioavailability after subcutaneous administration, a linear clearance mechanism with a prolonged half-life, and is at least as effective in preventing postoperative vein thrombosis. Theoretically these characteristics of low-molecular-weight heparin could lead to more predictable levels of heparin activity. In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin after an intravenous injection in patients undergoing aortic graft surgery. Heparin activity was measured before heparin administration and at 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 minutes after administration. The anti-Xa activity in the low-molecular-weight heparin group showed less variation and was more sustained when compared to the unfractionated heparin group. Fibrin degradation products were moderately correlated with the anti-factor Xa levels of the low-molecular-weight heparin group, but no correlation was found in the unfractionated heparin group. The anti-factor Xa activity of low-molecular-weight heparin was, in contrast to that of unfractionated heparin, not completely reversible by protamine administration. The blood loss was comparable in both groups. In contrast to what was expected, the pharmacokinetic profiles of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin showed a similarity after intravenous injection in patients undergoing aortobifemoral bypass grafting. Factors that could have influenced the pharmacokinetic behavior of heparin are discussed.\r"

Recently, the techniques for tissue culture have progressed; the ability to make formazan has improved with the use of methylthiazol tetrazolium bromide (MTT) instead of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in this assay. Therefore, we modified the SDI test in order to evaluate the drug response to gastrointestinal cancer and applied it in a clinical study. In this assay, the optimal concentration levels of mytomycin-C and Adriamycin for the clinical materials are 10 micrograms/ml, that is, 10 times higher than for the cancer cell line, and that of Cisplatin is 30 micrograms/ml, for Cisplatin is unstable in the culture medium. To evaluate its antitumor effect, it was found necessary to expose the cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 3 days. We applied this assay for the clinical materials; the evaluable rate of this assay is 83.3%. The peculiarity of this assay is its high evaluable rate. These results suggest that this test may be useful for clinical application.\r"

Identification of the factor VIII molecule, its components, and its functions has provided critical information about replacement requirements to prevent or control bleeding. Plasma and cryoprecipitate have been the mainstay of therapy. Until recently, lyophilized coagulation factor concentrates had little usefulness in treating vWD. Current factor VIII concentrates prepared by monoclonal or recombinant technology (or both) are devoid of von Willebrand factor. Desmopressin has been a revolutionary synthetic agent useful in numerous patients with mild or moderately severe vWD. In many patients, however, desmopressin is ineffective. Only a few currently available factor VIII concentrates contain biologically active von Willebrand factor and can be used to prepare patients for surgical procedures or to stop hemorrhage. Inhibitors of von Willebrand factor arise de novo or in patients with vWD. Management with activated prothrombin complex concentrates or removal of antibody with protein A columns has been successful. Despite current technologic advances, not all patients with vWD can be successfully treated. Many problems with vWD continue to be unresolved.\r"

The structure of these functional domains of von Willebrand factor, as known to date, is described.

With more precise characterization of molecular abnormalities, more selective therapeutic intervention for specific subtypes of von Willebrand's disease should eventuate.\r"

Specimens were tested for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and atypical mycobacteria in two assays, one based on amplification of the 65 kDa gene and the other on the IS6110 insertion sequence. For the 489 samples that did not contain inhibitors of the amplification reaction PCR findings correlated well with bacteriological and/or clinical data in 476 (97.4%). 6 PCR results turned out to be false negatives, 3 to be false positives and 4 to be mis-identification of strains. Pre-treatment of samples with guanidium thiocyanate reduced the proportion of false-negative results and of samples that contained inhibitors. This study confirms the potential of DNA amplification for early diagnosis of mycobacterial infections.\r"

  ".W": "The first step in infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the specific binding of gp120, the envelope glycoprotein of HIV, to its cellular receptor, CD4. To inhibit this interaction, soluble CD4 analogues that compete for gp120 binding and block HIV infection in vitro have been developed. To determine whether these analogues can protect an uninfected individual from challenge with HIV, we used the chimpanzee model system of cell-free HIV infection. Chimpanzees are readily infected with the IIIB strain of HIV-1, becoming viraemic within about 4-6 weeks of challenge, although they do not develop the profound CD4+ T-cell depletion and immunodeficiency characteristic of HIV infection in humans. CD4 immunoadhesin (CD4-IgG), a chimaeric molecule consisting of the N-terminal two immunoglobulin-like regions of CD4 joined to the Fc region of human IgG1, was selected as the CD4 analogue for testing because it has a longer half-life than CD4, contributed by the IgG Fc portion of the molecule. In humans, this difference results in a 25-fold increased concentration of CD4-IgG in the blood compared with recombinant CD4. Here we report that pretreatment with CD4-IgG can prevent the infection of chimpanzees with HIV-1. The need for a preventative agent is particularly acute in perinatal HIV transmission. As recombinant CD4-IgG, like the parent IgG molecule, efficiently crosses the primate placenta, it may be possible to set up an immune state in a fetus before HIV transfer occurs, thus preventing infection.\r"

  ".W": "Intramolecular crosslinking of the active site of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase with glutaraldehyde results in substantial inhibition of ATPase activity and stabilization of the ADP-sensitive E1 approximately P(2Ca) intermediate (E, enzyme) with occluded Ca2+ [Ross, D. C., Davidson, G. A. & McIntosh, D. B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4613-4621]. We show here, using conditions of low passive vesicle permeability and absence of ADP, that Ca2+ \"deoccludes\" more rapidly than it leaks out of the vesicle lumen. Deocclusion is paralleled by dephosphorylation. Therefore, turnover of crosslinked E1 approximately P(Ca) (approximately 5 nmol/min per mg of protein at 25 degrees C) involves Ca2+ release to the vesicle exterior and concomitant phosphoenzyme hydrolysis. Ca2+ release to the lumen, the normal pathway, is apparently blocked completely. In the presence of ADP, Ca2+ is also released to the vesicle exterior, and this release is coupled to the synthesis of ATP. The results suggest that a tertiary structural change at the active site follows phosphorylation and is an absolute requirement for Ca2+ release from the native enzyme to the vesicle lumen.\r"

  ".W": "We have purified a stimulatory GDP/GTP exchange protein for smg p21A and -B, ras p21-like small GTP-binding proteins (G proteins), cloned its cDNA, and named it GDP dissociation stimulator (smg p21 GDS). We show here that smg p21 GDS is active not only on smg p21A and -B but also on c-Ki-ras p21 and rhoA p21, all of which are post-translationally processed. Furthermore, we show that smg p21 GDS is inactive on the post-translationally unprocessed form of these proteins and on the post-translationally unprocessed form of c-Ha-ras p21 and smg p25A. All of the small G proteins recognized by smg p21 GDS have a cDNA-predicted C-terminal \"CAAX\" motif (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid) and a polybasic region upstream of this motif. These results suggest that smg p21 GDS is at least active on a group of small G proteins having these unique C-terminal structures. Moreover, they suggest that the C-terminal post-translational processing of these small G proteins, by farnesylation or geranylgeranylation of the C-terminal cysteine residue, removal of amino acids in positions denoted \"AAX\", and carboxyl methylation of the exposed cysteine residue, is important for the smg p21 GDS action.\r"

  ".W": "Tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collateral inputs into area CA1 of the hippocampus causes N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, an effect that contributes to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in this region. The present studies demonstrate that LTP-inducing tetanic stimulation in rat hippocampal area CA1 elicited increased levels of cAMP. The elevation of cAMP was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). Bath application of NMDA also resulted in an increase in cAMP in CA1, an effect that was blocked by both APV and removal of extracellular Ca2+. These findings suggest that activation of NMDA receptors elicits a Ca(2+)-dependent increase in cAMP, and taken together with the data from tetanic stimulation, suggest that NMDA-receptor-mediated increases in cAMP could play a role in the induction of LTP in area CA1. One role for cAMP may be to increase Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, as it was observed that application of either 8-bromo-cAMP or NMDA increased the fractional open time of high-threshold Ca2+ channels in CA1 pyramidal cells. Our results raise the possibility that a positive-feedback loop for Ca2+ influx in area CA1 exists. In this model, NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx leads to an enhancement of further Ca2+ influx via intermediate steps of increased cAMP and subsequent increased voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity.\r"
