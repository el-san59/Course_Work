  ".W": "We studied the vertical gradient in lung expansion in rabbits in the prone and supine body positions. Postmortem, we used videomicroscopy to measure the size of surface alveoli through transparent parietal pleural windows at dependent and nondependent sites separated in height by 2-3 cm at functional residual capacity (FRC). We compared the alveolar size measured in situ with that measured in the isolated lungs at different deflationary transpulmonary pressures to obtain transpulmonary pressure (pleural surface pressure) in situ. The vertical gradient in transpulmonary pressure averaged 0.48 +/- 0.16 (SD) cmH2O/cm height (n = 10) in the supine position and 0.022 +/- 0.014 (SD) cmH2O/cm (n = 5) in the prone position. In mechanically ventilated rabbits, we used the rib capsule technique to measure pleural liquid pressure at different heights of the chest in prone and supine positions. At FRC, the vertical gradient in pleural liquid pressure averaged 0.63 cmH2O/cm in the supine position and 0.091 cmH2O/cm in the prone position. The vertical gradients in pleural liquid pressure were all less than the hydrostatic value (1 cmH2O/cm), which indicates that pleural liquid is not generally in hydrostatic equilibrium. Both pleural surface pressure and pleural liquid pressure measurements show a greater vertical gradient in the supine than in the prone position. This suggests a close relationship between pleural surface pressure and pleural liquid pressure. Previous results in the dog and pony showed relatively high vertical gradients in the supine position and relatively small gradients in the prone position. This behavior is similar to the present results in rabbits. Thus the vertical gradient is independent of animal size and might be related to chest shape and weight of heart and abdominal contents.\r"

We measured several aspects of pulmonary function in rabbits to better understand the mechanisms involved. Seven does were given intramuscular betamethasone and six were given vehicle on days 25 and 26 of gestation. Delivery was on day 27 (term = 31). Half of the fetuses from each litter were given rabbit surfactant before the first breath. All fetuses were then ventilated at a consistent tidal volume for 1 h. Pulmonary function tests included static and dynamic compliance, expiratory time constant, stress relaxation, total lung resistance, and total lung conductance. Steroid or surfactant treatment increased dynamic compliance, and the effects of both together were greater than either alone. Static compliance was affected more by surfactant than steroids, whereas lung resistance and conductance were affected more by steroids. The differences in action of the two therapies help account for the increased dynamic compliance seen with combination therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic CO exposure, which stimulates erythropoietin production and erythropoiesis, was studied on carotid body cells in the rat. The hypothesis to be tested was that chronic CO inhalation would stimulate cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia of carotid body if it caused local tissue hypoxia as in chronic hypoxia. The failure of an appropriate response would indicate a lack of a specific local effect on carotid body tissue PO2 presumably because of its unusually high tissue blood flow. Six young male rats were exposed to 0.4-0.5 Torr (0.05-0.07%) inspired PCO in air for 22 days. Control rats (n = 6) were maintained under similar conditions except for CO exposure. After the exposure period the rats were anesthetized, blood was collected for hematocrit, and the carotid bodies were surgically exposed and fixed for electron microscopy and morphometry of type I and type II cells and capillary endothelium. Hematocrit was significantly greater in the CO-exposed group (75 vs. 48%), whereas no significant difference was found in the carotid body parenchyma between the control and CO-exposed groups. We conclude that the lack of an effect of chronic CO exposure on the carotid bodies in contrast to the strong erythropoietic response indicates a relatively high tissue blood flow rate in the carotid body and that CO did not exert a direct cellular effect. The results also suggest that the hypertrophic response of carotid body glomus cells to chronic hypoxic hypoxia is the result of a local direct effect of low PO2 rather than secondary to systemic effects.\r"

  ".U": "90008621\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary vascular responses to acetylcholine were compared under resting and high tone conditions of the intact-chest rabbit. Under resting tone conditions, intralobar injections of acetylcholine increased lobar arterial pressure in a dose-related manner. The pressor responses to acetylcholine under resting conditions were blocked by meclofenamate, indomethacin, atropine, and pirenzepine. When lobar vascular resistance was raised to a high steady level, low doses of acetylcholine decreased lobar arterial pressure, whereas higher doses elicited a biphasic response with the pressor component predominating at the highest dose studied. Under high tone conditions, only the pressor component of the response was blocked by meclofenamate or indomethacin, whereas pressor and depressor responses were blocked by atropine or the 600-micrograms/kg iv dose of pirenzepine. Pressor responses to acetylcholine under resting and high tone conditions were blocked by pirenzepine (50 micrograms/kg iv), whereas gallamine had no effect on responses to acetylcholine. The 50-micrograms/kg iv dose of pirenzepine had no effect on depressor responses or the depressor component of the response to acetylcholine. The present data support the concept that acetylcholine has significant cyclooxygenase-dependent pressor activity in the rabbit pulmonary vascular bed and suggest that this response is mediated by a muscarinic M1-type receptor. These data also show that, under high tone conditions, a vasodilator response or a vasodilator component of a biphasic response is unmasked. This response is not dependent on the release of cyclooxygenase products and is mediated by a muscarinic receptor that is neither of the M1- nor the M2-type.\r"

In the present investigation, we used this technique to evaluate the relative capacity of separate external (EI) and parasternal intercostal (PA) muscle contraction to produce changes in airway pressure and inspired volume. Studies were performed in 23 anesthetized phrenicotomized dogs. Electrical stimuli were applied to the spinal cord after hyperventilation-induced apnea, before and after sequentially severing either the PA or EI muscles from the first through sixth intercostal spaces. During spinal cord stimulation (SCS), measurements were made of inspired volume (delta V) with the airway open and negative airway pressure (delta P) during tracheal occlusion. Compared with control values, sectioning of the PA muscles resulted in a 40.9% reduction in delta P and 35.7% reduction in delta V during SCS. In other animals, initial sectioning of the EI muscles produced reductions in delta P and delta V of 67.4 and 63.0, respectively, during SCS. After subsequent section of the PA muscles, SCS produced only negligible inspired volumes and changes in airway pressure. We conclude that 1) the EI and PA muscles are each capable of generating substantial changes in airway pressure and large inspired volumes and 2) the ventilatory capacity of the EI muscles exceeds that of the PA muscles.\r"

The mass of weights lifted during the strength training increased by 85 +/- 9% (P less than 0.05), which was accompanied by an increase by 32 +/- 5% (P less than 0.05) of the estimated force developed. The wet muscle weight of the soleus and the plantaris decreased significantly with age. The phenomenon was counteracted but not neutralized by the strength training. Twitch and tetanic tension also decreased significantly with age in both the soleus and plantaris muscle. This was avoided by the strength training. This training also significantly decreased time to peak tension and half-relaxation time of both muscles. The swim training increased the heart-to-body weight ratio by 21 +/- 5% (P less than 0.05) and the endurance of the soleus muscle. Time to peak tension and triosephosphate dehydrogenase activity of the plantaris muscle were strongly correlated (P less than 0.001) with myosin adenosinetriphosphatase activity. The results show that the composition and contractile properties of old skeletal muscle are considerably affected by strength training repeated during a substantial period of old age, whereas swim training only affects the endurance of the skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Male Wistar rats were strength and swim trained during a substantial period of old age to determine the influence of aging and activity on the histochemical and metabolic characteristics of a predominantly slow (soleus) and a predominantly fast (plantaris) skeletal muscle. Strength training counteracted the age-related atrophy of the fibers and the age-induced changes in fiber-type distribution of both muscles. Swim training, on the other hand, was without any effect on these parameters. The activity of both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzymes became lower with aging in the soleus muscle, whereas only the activity of the cytoplasmic enzymes became lower in the plantaris. Strength training reduced the aerobic capacity of both muscles, whereas swim training had the opposite effect. Aging induced a lower glycogen concentration of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle. This was avoided by swim training. The phosphocreatine and adenosine 5'-triphosphate concentrations were unchanged with aging but became higher with strength training. The activity pattern, therefore, seems to have a considerable influence on the age-related modification of the histochemical and metabolic characteristics of skeletal muscles of the rat. The effect, however, is related to the recruitment pattern of the fiber populations and the form of activity.\r"

Three to thirteen weeks after surgery, the oil was removed through a subcutaneous port. Lung volumes were measured serially until 3-6 wk after balloon deflation. With pneumonectomy the total lung capacity (TLC) decreased to less than 50% of the preoperative value and remained essentially unchanged while the balloon was inflated. At balloon deflation, TLC and vital capacity did not change immediately, whereas functional residual capacity increased by 44%, indicating a change of 2-3 cmH2O in end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure. TLC increased by 10% within 3 days and continued to increase over the subsequent 3-5 wk by a total of 25% over TLC at balloon deflation. There was little difference in this response between animals whose balloons were deflated 3 wk after surgery and those in which deflation was delayed up to 13 wk. After pneumonectomy in the adult ferret, the remaining lung increases in volume in response to an increase in lung distension even weeks or months after surgery. The extent to which this volume increase involves lung tissue growth or depends on previous lung resection is at present unknown. This model may be useful for studies of the mechanisms by which lung distension influences lung volume and compensatory lung growth.\r"

  ".W": "Several manifestations of lung disease during infancy suggest that mechanical interdependence can be relatively high in newborn lungs. To test this possibility, we measured elastic moduli and pleural membrane tension in lungs excised from piglets ranging in age from less than 12 h to 85 days. Near maximum inflation, newborn lungs (less than 12 h, n = 6) had no detectable pleural membrane tension, although 3- to 5-day-old lungs (n = 6) had tension greater than 5,000 dyn/cm. In contrast, parenchymal recoil was greater in the newborn lungs [19.3 +/- 3.0 (SD) vs. 14.3 +/- 2.4 cmH2O at 90% of maximum inflation volume, P less than 0.01]. Shear moduli were higher (13.5 +/- 4.6 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.5 cmH2O at 15 cmH2O transpulmonary pressure, P less than 0.05) and Poisson ratios were lower in the newborn lungs as compared with the 3- to 5-day-old lungs. Postnatal lung growth between 3 and 85 days was characterized by 1) a constant shear modulus (0.6 times transpulmonary pressure); 2) decrease in the bulk modulus (from 6.8 to 5.1 times transpulmonary pressure, P less than 0.005); and 3) evidence of gas trapping at progressively higher transpulmonary pressures. Therefore, growth of parenchyma in the piglet lung is associated with reduced stiffness to volume change but with no effect on overall stiffness to shape change. Nevertheless, a relatively great stiffness to shape change occurs transiently in newborn piglet lungs.\r"

We compared the effects of capsaicin injected intravenously, administered as an aerosol, and administered topically into the intrathoracic trachea in anesthetized dogs (n = 17) and rats (n = 17). We measured esophageal, subglottic, and arterial pressures together with abdominal muscle electromyogram. Changes in expiratory duration [(TE), measured as the ratio TEtest to TEcontrol, mean +/- SD] due to capsaicin were similar with all three routes of administration in both dogs (intravenous, 7.9 +/- 4.6; aerosol, 5.5 +/- 3.1; topically into intrathoracic trachea, 7.1 +/- 4.8) and rats (intravenous, 22.6 +/- 10.3; aerosol, 11.1 +/- 8.2; topically into intrathoracic trachea, 21.6 +/- 4.6). An increase in laryngeal resistance was a constant finding in the rat, but it was less frequent in the dog. Cardiovascular responses consisting of bradycardia and hypotension occurred with all three routes of administration but had longer delays than the respiratory responses. Capsaicin instillation into the extrathoracic trachea in dogs (n = 7) also induced qualitatively similar cardiorespiratory responses. We conclude that 1) capsaicin-sensitive receptors are accessible from both the pulmonary circulation and the airway lumen and 2) afferents, even in the extrapulmonary portion of the tracheobronchial tree, can play a role in the reflex responses to intraluminal capsaicin.\r"

However, when this postural change is produced over a 4- to 5-s period, there is an initial apnea during which all the muscles are silent. In the present studies, we have taken advantage of this initial silence to determine functional residual capacity (FRC) and measure the subsequent change in end-expiratory lung volume. Eight animals were studied, and in all of them end-expiratory lung volume in the head-up posture decreased relative to FRC [329 +/- 70 (SE) ml]. Because this decrease also represents the increase in lung volume as a result of expiratory muscle relaxation at the end of the expiratory pause, it can be used to determine the expiratory muscle contribution to tidal volume (VT). The average contribution was 62 +/- 6% VT. After denervation of the rib cage expiratory muscles, the reduction in end-expiratory lung volume still amounted to 273 +/- 84 ml (49 +/- 10% VT). Thus, in head-up dogs, about two-thirds of VT result from the action of the expiratory muscles, and most of it (83%) is due to the action of the abdominal rather than the rib cage expiratory muscles.\r"

Although the percent of the fluid that was returned and the total numbers of cells were greater in the 250- vs. the 100-ml lavage, there were no significant differences in cell differentials or numbers of cells per milliliter between the 100- and 250-ml BAL.

With the use of a highly sensitive spectral analysis technique (cross correlation) to define beat-to-beat coupling between respiratory frequency and heart rate period (R-R) and hence RSA, we compared the effects of patterned breathing at defined respiratory frequency and tidal volumes (VT), Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers, single deep breaths, and unpatterned spontaneous breathing on RSA in 12 normal volunteers and 8 cardiac allograft transplant recipients. In normal subjects R-R changes closely followed changes in respiratory frequency (P less than 0.001) but were little affected by changes in VT. On the R-R spectrum, an oscillation peak synchronous with respiration was found in heart transplant patients. However, the average magnitude of the respiration-related oscillations was 1.7-7.9% that seen in normal subjects and was proportionally more influenced by changes in VT. Changes in R-R induced by Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers were 3.8 and 4.9% of those seen in normal subjects, respectively, whereas changes in R-R induced by single deep breaths were 14.3% of those seen in normal subjects. The magnitude of RSA was not related to time since the heart transplantation, neither was it related to patient age or sex. Thus the heart has the intrinsic ability to vary heart rate in synchrony with ventilation, consistent with the hypothesis that changes, or rate of changes, in myocardial wall stretch might alter intrinsic heart rate independent of autonomic tone.\r"

During hypoxia, at a given O2 consumption the venous and arterial lactate concentrations, the venous and arterial concentration differences, and the net lactate release were lower after acclimatization than during acute altitude exposure. While breathing O2-enriched air after acclimatization at a given O2 consumption the venous and arterial lactate concentrations and the venous and arterial concentration differences were significantly lower, and the net lactate release tended to be lower than while breathing ambient air at sea level before acclimatization. We conclude that the lower lactate concentration in venous and arterial blood during exercise after altitude acclimatization reflected less net release of lactate by the exercising muscles, and that this likely resulted from the acclimatization process itself rather than the hypoxia per se.\r"

  ".W": "Rapid protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation in awake sheep caused, after 1 min, a approximately 15-fold increase of arterial plasma thromboxane B2 (TxB2) levels, a 4-fold rise of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), a 2-fold rise of pulmonary arterial pressure, and after 3 min, a 2-fold rise of ovine arterial plasma complement C3a levels (P less than 0.05). Infusion of nafamstat mesilate (FUT-175), a protease and complement pathway inhibitor, before protamine reduced these increases by approximately 60-90% (P less than 0.05). FUT-175 did not modify heparin + protamine-induced leukopenia, suggesting that FUT-175 incompletely blocked C5a production. We also learned that infusing protamine first and heparin 5 min later did not increase either plasma C3a or TxB2 levels or PVR while the activated clotting time increased only minimally. Thus, in awake sheep, the sequence of heparin and protamine infusion influences complement activation and pulmonary vasoconstriction. FUT-175 pretreatment reduces thromboxane release and pulmonary vasoconstriction probably by limiting complement activation.\r"

  ".W": "Allen et al. (J. Clin. Invest. 76: 620-629, 1985) reported that during oscillatory forcing the base of isolated canine lungs distends preferentially relative to the apex as frequency and tidal volume increase. The tendency toward such nonuniform phasic lung distension might influence phasic displacement of the rib cage (RC) relative to the abdomen (ABD). To test this hypothesis we measured RC and ABD displacement in four anesthetized dogs during forced oscillation. Sinusoidal volume changes were delivered through a tracheostomy at 1-32 Hz and measured by body plethysmography. RC and ABD displacements were measured by inductive plethysmography. During oscillation with air at fixed tidal volumes (10-80 ml) RC, normalized to unity at 1 Hz, increased to 2.06-2.22 at 8 Hz (P less than 0.001) and then decreased to 1.06-1.35 (P less than 0.0025) at 32 Hz. ABD, normalized to unity at 1 Hz, was 1.12-1.16 at 4 Hz (P less than 0.001) and decreased to 0.12-0.14 at 32 Hz (P less than 0.001). Displacement of ABD relative to RC did not increase systematically with increasing tidal volume during sinusoidal forcing at any frequency. Thus we found no discernible influence of nonuniform phasic lung distension on chest wall behavior. We infer that in the dog the nonuniform mechanical behavior of the chest wall dominates the nonuniform (but opposing) mechanical tendency of the lung.\r"

Erythrocytes (RBC), albumin, and PL or PMN, labeled with 99mTc, 131I, and 111In,-respectively, were injected intravenously into anesthetized and ventilated guinea pigs. The different parameters were calculated from in vivo lung and blood radioactivity values. When N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) was injected intravenously at 10 micrograms.kg-1, lung RBC content dropped by 14.7 +/- 1.8% (SE; n = 10), indicating a reduced lung blood volume, ALBev rose to 15.0 +/- 3.2% of the initial albumin vascular content, and the circulating PMN were sequestered by 9.2 +/- 1.7%. A transient PL sequestration was also observed 1 min after the injection of fMLP (13.1 +/- 2.0%, n = 7). During the infusion of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, the lung PL content rose dose dependently from 10.1 +/- 2.2% of the circulating pool with 3 ng.kg-1.min-1 to 54.9 +/- 20.1% with 44 ng.kg-1.min-1, the lung RBC content decreased by greater than 10%, and the ALBev increased beyond 16%. Our method allows the study of the correlations between cell entrapment and the variations of the albumin exchanges in the lung and may lead to a better understanding of the correlations between cell activation and edema.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of momentum transfer between inflow jets and resident gas during constant-flow ventilation (CFV) predicts inhomogeneity of alveolar pressures (PA) and volume, which might account for specific ventilation-variance in the lung. Using alveolar needles to measure pressures (PA) during CFV in eight anesthetized dogs with wide thoracotomy, we observed random dispersion of PA among lobes of up to 12.5 cmH2O. Within each lobe, the PA dispersion was up to 10 cmH2O at CFV of 90 l/min; when flow decreased, PA at all sites decreased, as did the intralobar dispersion. These pressure differences were not observed during conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). During CFV with room air, dogs were hypoxemic [arterial PO2 (Pao2) 54 +/- 15 Torr] and the venous admixture (Qva/QT) was 50 +/- 15%. When inspiratory O2 fraction was increased to 0.4, Pao2 increased to 172 +/- 35 Torr and Qva/QT dropped to 13.5 +/- 8.4%, confirming considerable ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) variance not observed during CMV. We conclude that momentum transfer between the inflow stream and resident gas caused inhomogeneities of alveolar pressures, volumes, and ventilation responsible for VA/Q variance and hypoxemia during CFV. Conceivably, the abnormal ventilation distribution is minimized by collateral ventilation and forces of interdependence between regions of high and low alveolar pressures. Momentum transfer also predicted the mucosal damage observed on histological evaluation of the bronchial walls near the site of inflow jet impact.\r"

We measured the change in total pulmonary resistance induced by substance P or capsaicin in the presence or absence of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, phosphoramidon, in infected and in noninfected animals. In the absence of phosphoramidon, the bronchoconstrictor responses to substance P and to capsaicin were greater in infected than in noninfected animals. Phosphoramidon did not further potentiate the responses to substance P and to capsaicin in the infected animals, whereas it did so in noninfected animals. Studies performed in vitro showed that nonadrenergic noncholinergic bronchial smooth muscle responses to electrical field stimulation were also increased in tissues from infected animals and that phosphoramidon increased the response of tissues from noninfected animals greatly but increased the responses of tissues from infected animals only slightly. Responses to acetylcholine were unaffected by viral infection. Neutral endopeptidase activity was decreased by 40% in the tracheal epithelial layer of the infected animals. We suggest that respiratory infection by Sendai virus causes enhanced airway responsiveness to tachykinins by decreasing neutral endopeptidase-like activity in the airway epithelium.\r"

This array provides information about the spatial distribution of the electrical field generated by the diaphragm and reveals a sharply peaked variation of electrical potential with distance along the esophagus. The rectified and integrated information from each of the seven pairs is summed to give an approximation to the total electrical activity over the span of the array, providing a signal that is relatively insensitive to the position of the array over approximately 4 cm of catheter movement and removes the requirement for balloon stabilization of the catheter. With our array, we have confirmed the artifact in the evoked compound muscle action potential that seems to be related to diaphragmatic shape as reported by others who used supramaximal phrenic nerve stimulation, but the magnitude of this artifact (compared with the functional residual capacity level) was modest near functional residual capacity, averaging 12 +/- 14% (SD) for lung volumes 1.0 l above and -4 +/- 15% for lung volumes 1.0 l below functional residual capacity along the rib cage-abdomen relaxation line.\r"

Before testing an esophageal balloon was inserted, and lung volumes, flow rates, maximal inspiratory (at residual volume and functional residual capacity) and expiratory (at total lung capacity and functional residual capacity) mouth pressures, and pulmonary mechanics (static and dynamic compliance and airway resistance) were measured before and immediately after the exposure period. After the postexposure measurements had been completed, the subjects inhaled an aerosol of 20% lidocaine until response to citric acid aerosol inhalation was abolished. All of the measurements were immediately repeated. We found that the O3 exposure 1) induced a significant mean decrement of 17.8% in vital capacity (this change was the result of a marked fall in inspiratory capacity without significant increase in residual volume), 2) significantly increased mean airway resistance and specific airway resistance but did not change dynamic or static pulmonary compliance or viscous or elastic work, 3) significantly reduced maximal transpulmonary pressure (by 19%) but produced no changes in inspiratory or expiratory maximal mouth pressures, and 4) significantly increased respiratory rate (in 5 subjects by more than 6 breaths/min) and decreased tidal volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We measured vital capacity (VC), inspiratory capacity, and tidal volume by integrating airflow at the mouth and changes in rib cage and abdominal volume (delta Vrc and delta Vab, respectively, where delta Vrc + delta Vab = delta Vw) using induction plethysmography. During microgravity (0 Gz) FRC decreased by 413 +/- 70 (SE) ml and VC by 0.37 liter. The decrease in Vw did not differ from that in FRC and was entirely the result of reduction of Vab, the Vrc showing no significant change. During tidal breathing the abdominal contribution (delta Vab/delta Vw) increased from 0.39 +/- 0.08 at 1 Gz to 0.57 +/- 0.08 at 0 Gz. During brief periods of hypergravity (approximately 1.8 Gz) all changes were opposite in sign and relatively smaller. Limited data during \"roller coaster\" flight patterns suggested that, in contrast to configurational changes, the temporal pattern of breathing was uninfluenced by changes in Gz. We conclude that at the onset of weightlessness there are substantial changes in lung volume and thoracoabdominal configuration. Abdominal contribution to tidal excursions increases but the temporal pattern of breathing is unchanged.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports indicate that under certain restricted conditions hyperoxia may decrease tissue O2 consumption. However, this effect has not been established for whole body O2 consumption in the intact healthy conscious state. The goal of the present study was to document the effect of hyperoxia on resting whole body O2 consumption and hemodynamics under these latter more general physiological conditions. The inspired gas was delivered by mask to six fasted resting conscious dogs and alternated hourly between air and O2-enriched air (hyperoxia) for 5 h, while hemodynamics and blood gas data were obtained every 20 min. Compared with air breathing, hyperoxia increased the mean arterial O2 tension from 95 to 475 Torr and decreased heart rate, cardiac output, pulmonary vascular resistance, and right and left ventricular work rates and thus, presumably, myocardial O2 consumption. Hyperoxia also increased systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure but did not change stroke volume or systemic arterial pressure. The increase in arterial O2 content during hyperoxia was counterbalanced by the decrease in cardiac output, so that O2 delivery was unchanged by hyperoxia. Surprisingly, hyperoxia decreased the arterial-to-mixed venous difference in O2 content; this decrease together with the decrease in cardiac output produced a decrease in resting whole body O2 consumption from 5.88 +/- 0.68 to 4.80 +/- 0.62 ml O2.min-1.kg-1 (P = 0.0002). It is concluded that under physiological conditions normobaric hyperoxia may decrease metabolic rate in addition to cardiac output, which may have important implications for the metabolic regulation of O2 utilization as well as for the medical and nonmedical uses of O2.\r"

Tissue PO2 (PtiO2) and O2 disappearance rates (dPO2/dt) after brief blood flow occlusion were measured with recessed cathode microelectrodes (tip diameter less than 5 microns) at 150 sites in 15 normal cats (controls) and at 154 sites in 5 cats in which one CB had been denervated 2 or 3 days before the experiments. Mean PtiO2 was slightly higher in denervated CBs: 79.6 +/- 1.6 (SE) Torr compared with 76.4 +/- 2.0 Torr for controls (P = not significant). Mean dPO2/dt was 8.4% faster: -8.42 +/- 0.28 Torr/s compared with -7.77 +/- 0.43 Torr/s for controls (P less than 0.05). The O2 consumption rate (VO2), calculated from dPO2/dt correcting for cat oxyhemoglobin, was 7.5% higher: 1.62 and 1.51 ml.100 g-1.min-1, respectively, for denervated and control CBs (P less than 0.05). The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, Kmapp (defined as the PtiO2 where dPO2/dt decreased by 50% from the initial rate during the first 3 s after occlusion) was determined for each O2 disappearance curve. After denervation, Kmapp decreased significantly by -47%: 12.0 +/- 1.3 Torr compared with 22.6 +/- 2.5 Torr for controls (P less than 0.01). The data provide evidence for a second metabolic pathway for O2 in the CB that loses its influence on VO2 after denervation.\r"

The following characteristics of EC subpopulations were examined: 1) cell volume; 2) cell cycle position; and 3) cytotoxic indexes for both acute cell survival and proliferative capacity after irradiation (137Cs, gamma, 0-10 Gy). EC cultured from bovine aortas were separated by centrifugal elutriation into subpopulations of different cell volumes. Through flow cytometry, we found that cell volume was related to the cell cycle phase distribution. The smallest EC were distributed in G1 phase and the larger cells were distributed in either early S, middle S, or late S + G2M phases. Cell cycle phase at the time of irradiation was not associated with acute cell loss. However, distribution in the cell cycle did relate to cell survival based on proliferative capacity (P less than 0.01). The order of increasing radioresistance was cells in G1 (D0 = 110 cGy), early S (135 cGy), middle S (145 cGy), and late S + G2M phases (180 cGy). These findings 1) suggest an age-related response to radiation in a nonmalignant differentiated cell type and 2) demonstrate EC subpopulations in culture.\r"

Intrathoracic pressure was varied from 0 to -40 cmH2O. BPF flow varied directly with mean airway pressure (P less than 0.001). However, at constant mean airway pressure, BPF flow was not influenced independently by changes in peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, or inspiratory time. Resistance of the BPF increased as intrathoracic pressure became more negative. Despite increased resistance, BPF flow also increased. BPF resistance was constant over the range of mean airway (P less than 0.01) pressures investigated. Our data document the influence of mean airway pressure and intrathoracic pressure on BPF flow and suggest that manipulations which reduce transpulmonary pressure will decrease BPF flow.\r"

With time, intratracheal label decreased in lavage and appeared in the lamellar body fraction, and intravenous label accumulated in both pools. Using a tracer analysis for non-steady state, we calculated surfactant secretion and clearance rates for the newborn period. Before birth, both rates rose slightly from 1.8 micrograms PL.g body wt-1.h-1 at 6 h before birth to 7.3 at birth. Immediately after birth, secretion rate rose to 37.7 micrograms PL.g body wt-1.h-1.

Measurements were made with an almost constant-volume input (160-180 ml) or with an almost constant-flow input (20-30 ml.s-1). No significant difference was found between the two conditions. Lung resistance (RL) sharply decreased from 0.97 kPa.l-1.s at 0.01 Hz to 0.27 kPa.l-1.s at 0.03 Hz and then mildly to 0.23 kPa.l-1.s at 0.1 Hz. Lung effective compliance (CL) decreased slightly and regularly from 0.01 Hz (2.38 l.kPa-1) to 0.1 Hz (1.93 l.kPa-1). The data were analyzed using a linear viscoelastic model adapted from Hildebrandt (J. Appl. Physiol. 28:365-372, 1970) and complemented by a Newtonian resistance (R): RL = R + B/(9.2f); CL = 1/(A + 0.25B + B.log2 pi f), where f is the frequency and B/A is an index of lung tissue viscoelasticity. A good fit was generally obtained, with an average difference of 10% between the observed and predicted values. The ratio B/A was not affected by the breathing and was 10.6 and 13.6% in the constant-volume and constant-flow conditions, respectively, which agrees with Hildebrandt's observations in isolated cat lungs. R was systematically larger than the plethysmographic airway resistance, suggesting that lung tissue resistance might also include a Newtonian component.\r"

  ".W": "There is an accumulating body of evidence which suggests that chemical control of breathing can play a role in destabilizing respiratory rhythm during sleep. We hypothesized that the sleeping ventilatory response to hypercapnia (HCVR) and/or hypoxia (HVR) would predict respiratory events following release of inspiratory airway obstruction (IAO) in normal men during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. We therefore measured HCVR, HVR, and ventilation for three breaths preceding and eight breaths following three totally obstructed inspirations in eight normal subjects during NREM sleep. After IAO, we generally observed transient hyperventilation that resulted in hypocapnia and prolonged expiratory time. We found the initial increase in inspiratory minute ventilation (VI) following IAO to be correlated with HCVR (r = 0.72, P less than 0.05) but not HVR. In addition, the maximum decrease in PCO2 below base line was also related to HCVR (r = 0.83, P less than 0.05). This decrement in PCO2 predicted the subsequent prolongation in expiratory time (TE, r = 0.83, P less than 0.05) that was frequently observed. HCVR tended to predict the prolongation of TE, at the nadir of CO2 (r = 0.69, P = 0.057). In conjunction with this hypocapnia and prolongation of TE, hypoventilation with falling VI was often observed followed by periodic hyper- and hypoventilation. These results suggest that high HCVR may result in ventilatory overshoot following IAO and may contribute to ventilatory instability during sleep.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of training on fatty acid and glyceride synthesis by liver and adipose tissue homogenates of young and old Fischer-344 rats was examined. Four groups of rats (10 animals/group) were studied: young untrained, young trained, old untrained, and old trained. Training of each group was for 10 wk at 75% maximal O2 uptake. Young rats were killed at 6 mo of age and old rats were killed at 27 mo of age. Fatty acid synthesis was assessed by measuring the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, ATP citrate-lyase, \"malic\" enzyme, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glyceride synthesis was evaluated by determining the rate of incorporation of [14C]glycerol 3-phosphate into lipids. In addition, lipoprotein lipase activity was measured in acetone-ether powders of adipose tissue from the four groups of rats. In liver, training had no effect on fatty acid or glyceride synthesis in either group. However, aging caused a significant decrease in the activities of four of the lipogenic enzymes but had no effect on glyceride synthesis. Training caused an increase in fatty acid synthase and glyceride synthesis in adipose tissue, and aging decreased lipoprotein lipase activity. It was concluded that training enhances the synthetic capacity of lipids by adipose tissue but that aging had a more profound effect in that the activities of the enzymes involved in these processes were lower in the old rats. Furthermore, the decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase in the older rats may explain the higher plasma triglyceride levels that were observed in these animals.\r"

The experimental (E) group consisted of 17 healthy male subjects; 20 healthy males served as the control (C) group. Post hoc Scheffe contrasts computed on E group data indicated that, for both LBM and %BF, the Lukaski and Segal BIA equations, as well as the Durnin SF equation, derived mean values that were not significantly different (0.05 significance level) from HW in both pre- and postregimen conditions. For LBM, the same equations derived the following significant (P less than 0.01) correlation coefficients for both pre- and postregimen data: Lukaski, 0.87 and 0.85; Segal, 0.89 and 0.87; and Durnin, 0.90 and 0.88. For %BF, the correlation coefficients were slightly lower but remained statistically significant (P less than 0.01). The findings of this study suggest that the BIA method, by use of either the Lukaski or Segal prediction equations, is a valid means of predicting changes in human body composition as measured by the Siri transformation of body density.\r"

In a hollow cast of the central airways, the only factors involved are resistance and inertia of the airflow. Distribution of steady flow during both inhalation and exhalation was measured at different total flow rates in human and canine tracheobronchial casts. The resulting airflow rates in peripheral segments were measured with a sensitive apparatus, which did not disturb the distribution of flow. Inertia of the airflow was found to be small but significant in airways of the human cast and substantially greater in the canine airway cast than in the human cast during inhalation. The influence of airflow inertia during inhalation was largely responsible for the different distributions of flow during inhalation and exhalation through the airway casts. Airflow resistance was found to be considerably greater during exhalation and may have contributed to the redistribution of flow. The forces involved are small but should be considered when modeling the in vivo distribution of airflow.\r"

  ".W": "Partial expiratory flow-volume (PEFV) curves in infants are generated by applying a compressive pressure over the chest wall with an inflatable jacket. This study addresses two issues: pressure transmission to and across the chest wall and whether flow limitation can be identified. Eleven infants sedated with chloral hydrate were studied. Pressure transmission to the chest wall, measured with neonatal blood pressure cuffs placed on the infant's body surface, was 72 +/- 4% of jacket pressure during compression maneuvers. The pressure transmission to the air spaces, determined by measuring airway pressure during a compression maneuver against an occluded airway, was 56 +/- 6% of jacket pressure. A significant amount of the applied pressure is therefore lost across both the jacket and chest wall. Rapid pressure oscillations (RPO) were superimposed on static jacket pressures while expiratory flow was measured. Absence of associated oscillations of flow measured at the mouth was taken to indicate that flow was independent of driving pressure and therefore limited. Flow limitation was demonstrable with the RPO technique in all infants for jacket pressures greater than 50 cmH2O; however, it was evident at jacket pressures less than 30 cmH2O jacket pressure in four infants with obstructive airway disease. The RPO technique is a useful adjunct to the compression maneuver utilized to generate PEFV curves in infants because it facilitates the recognition of expiratory flow limitation.\r"

We systematically specify the underlying blood flow and examine the resulting fluxes of several gases, allowing for the appropriate tissue resistances. For physiological flows, the stratum corneum has an effect equivalent to a series resistance. Helium flux at low total flow depends primarily on subdermal perfusion, but at higher flow, middermal and subpapillary effects become important. The fluxes of less permeable gases, such as argon and xenon, depend on middermal and subpapillary flow at lower total flows. From any single measurement of gas flux, it is difficult to establish an unambiguous value for the underlying blood flow, but the simultaneous measurement of different gases narrows the range of plausible conditions.\r"

It incorporates the characteristics of normal mechanical ventilation and also allows one to perform a multitude of test procedures for lung function and circulatory studies in paralyzed animals. The major components of the setup are a pump assembly with solenoid valves to direct gas flow, an electromechanical servo system, and a MS-DOS microcomputer system. The pump assembly has been constructed as a relatively simple device. Great versatility is created by the use of a microcomputer for the control of the ventilator. The software can be easily adapted to several other types of experimental studies. Besides the keyboard input the ventilator can be controlled by a remote computer system. This allows one to run an experimental protocol automatically and to use it in closed-loop servo ventilation. The flexibility in the choice of the respiratory parameters makes the ventilator suitable for lung function and circulatory studies during artificial ventilation. The ventilator has been successfully used in different animal studies during the last 6 yr.\r"

These measurements have been extremely time consuming because of the difficulty in obtaining repeatable constant speed trials (particularly with animals). We have overcome this difficulty by mounting a force platform directly under the belt of a motorized treadmill. With this arrangement, vertical force can be recorded from an unlimited number of successive ground contacts in a much shorter time. With this treadmill-mounted force platform it is possible to accurately make the following measurements over the full range of steady speeds and under various perturbations of normal gait: 1) vertical ground reaction force over the course of the contact phase; 2) peak forces in bone, muscle, and tendon; 3) the vertical displacement of the center of mass; and 4) contact time for the limbs. In our treadmill-force platform design, belt forces and frictional forces cause no measurable cross-talk problem. Natural frequency (160 Hz), nonlinearity (less than 5%), and position independence (less than 2%) are all quite acceptable. Motor-caused vibrations are greater than 150 Hz and thus can be easily filtered.\r"

Physiol. 2: 283-299) advocated calculation of a \"dilution index\" from data of the alveolar plateau of single-breath tests; the calculation provides an estimate of the dilution of resident gas in the lung that gave rise to the observed concentrations. In this communication, we show that the calculation can be applied to conventional single-breath tests where O2 is inhaled by air-breathing persons, and we illustrate the principle with vital capacity breaths of a mixture that contained a low concentration of neon. The dilution was approximately 3:1 in young subjects (20-30 yr), as if a vital capacity of 6 liters were mixed with a residual volume of 2 liters. The dilution was less, 2:1, in older subjects (56 yr) and tended to become as low as 1:1 during emptying of the closing volume. In addition to being more informative, the dilution index format allows common sense comparison of alveolar plateau levels and slopes when single-breath tests are done by various methods.\r"

Sudden atraumatic subluxation is quite alarming to the patient and the physician. Twenty-nine of the thirty-seven patients were treated non-operatively by observation and rehabilitative measures. Eight patients had been treated elsewhere with attempted operative reconstruction of the sternoclavicular joint or with resection arthroplasty. After an average follow-up of eight years, the twenty-nine patients who were treated non-operatively (group I) had excellent results, with no limitations of activity or changes in life-style. The eight patients who were treated operatively (group II) had numerous problems, including noticeable scars, persistent instability, pain, or limitation of activity that resulted in an alteration in lifestyle. Three of the eight patients had had a resection of the medial portion of the clavicle. Two of them had a second resection and the third patient had a third resection. A thoracic-outlet syndrome developed in this patient and the clavicle had to be totally resected to obtain relief. Since spontaneous atraumatic anterior subluxation of the sternoclavicular joint has a benign natural course, it should not be treated with operative stabilization of the joint. Instead, a conservative approach that includes education and reassurance of the patient will result in an unaltered lifestyle with no limitation of activity and little or no discomfort.\r"

  ".U": "90008946\r", 
  ".W": "The long-term success of massive osteochondral allografts depends not only on the incorporation of the transplanted articular cartilage. Osteochondral allografts are immunogenic, and, once an immune response is stimulated by exposure to donor cellular antigens, the cartilage becomes vulnerable to direct injury by cytotoxic antibodies or by lymphocytes, or to indirect injury by inflammatory mediators and enzymes induced by the immune response. To clarify the role of histocompatibility antigen-matching on the health of transplanted articular cartilage, we orthotopically implanted canine leukocyte antigen-matched and mismatched proximal osteochondral allografts of the radius, both fresh and cryopreserved, in beagles. Four groups of dogs received: (1) canine leukocyte antigen-mismatched frozen allografts, (2) canine leukocyte antigen-mismatched fresh allografts, (3) canine leukocyte antigen-matched fresh allografts, or (4) canine leukocyte antigen-matched frozen allografts. In twelve of the dogs, the contralateral leg was subjected to a sham operation, and in ten of the dogs, the proximal part of the radius was removed and replaced as an autogenous graft control. All animals were followed for eleven months after the operation and then were killed. The cartilage of the grafts was evaluated grossly, histologically, and biochemically. The biochemical analysis consisted of measurement of dry weight, content of glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline, and galactosamine-to-glucosamine ratios. Analyses of variance were used to study the effect of tissue antigen-matching and freezing on degradation of cartilage. During the study, no dog had grossly obvious clinical abnormalities, all host-graft interfaces healed, and no joints dislocated. The gross appearance of the cartilage was normal for both the joints that had an autogenous graft and those that were subjected to the sham operation. The cartilage of all allografts was thinned, dull, and roughened. The synovial membrane of all of the joints that had been operated on was mildly fibrotic and hyperplastic, but only that of the dogs that had an allograft was severely fibrotic and hyperplastic and demonstrated an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response was most severe in joints that had received a fresh canine leukocyte antigen-mismatched allograft. Invasive pannus was more frequent in joints that had received a fresh graft, particularly those that had received a canine leukocyte antigen-mismatched allograft, and cartilage was sometimes eroded to subchondral bone. Freezing was harmful to the cartilage. Very few cells survived the freezing procedure, and frozen grafts received s significantly worse histological scores had significantly less glycosaminoglycans and had a lower ratio of galactosamine to glucosamine than fresh grafts.\r"

We studied the progression of the kyphosis and evaluated the function and fate of the bone grafts that were used. At eight years, the results with respect to the progression of the kyphosis were classified as excellent or good in forty-eight patients (59 per cent), all of whom had had minimum destruction of the vertebral bodies; limited surgical excision of bone, resulting in a small post-debridement defect that needed only a short graft; marked intraoperative correction of the deformity; and involvement of lower lumbar segments. Fifteen patients (19 per cent) had a fair result and eighteen (22 per cent), a poor result. An increase in the deformity was common in patients who had extensive involvement of the vertebral bodies that had resulted in a large post-debridement defect necessitating a graft spanning more than two disc spaces. Lesions of the thoracic vertebrae were associated with many of the poor results, and patients who had a marked kyphosis before treatment also did not do well. A stable graft that provided structural support was observed in only thirty-three patients (41 per cent), and failure of the graft due to slippage, fracture, absorption, or subsidence was seen in forty-eight patients (59 per cent). The length of the graft also played a role: the graft failed most often in patients in whom it spanned more than two disc spaces. We concluded that it is unwise to rely solely on the graft to prevent vertebral collapse in patients in whom the length of the graft exceeds two disc spaces. These patients may benefit from additional measures, such as an extended period of non-weight-bearing, posterior arthrodesis after six to twelve weeks, and prolonged use of a brace until complete consolidation is evident.\r"

Twenty-seven fractures were classified as grade-I open fractures; sixteen, as grade-II open fractures; and forty-six, as grade-III open fractures. Immediate intramedullary nailing was done for fifty-six fractures, and delayed stabilization (five to seven days after delayed closure of the wound) was done for thirty-three fractures. A prerequisite for immediate intramedullary nailing was that irrigation and debridement of the open wound be done within eight hours after injury. All fractures healed in an average of 5.2 months. No infections occurred in the sixty-two grade-I, grade-II, or grade-IIIA open fractures, regardless of whether immediate or delayed intramedullary nailing was performed. Of the twenty-seven grade-IIIB fractures, infection developed in three: in one after immediate intramedullary nailing and in two after delayed intramedullary nailing. We concluded that, if a thorough and timely debridement can be accomplished, immediate intramedullary nailing of grade-I and grade-II open fractures of the femoral shaft does not increase the risk of postoperative infection. Selected patients who have a grade-III open fracture may be candidates for immediate intramedullary stabilization, depending on the degree of the patient's associated injuries and the extent of disruption and contamination of the soft tissues of the thigh.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the efficacy of high-volume, high-pressure pulsatile lavage in the prevention of cardiopulmonary dysfunction and fat embolism during cemented arthroplasty, we studied twenty-eight mongrel dogs that had had a bilateral cemented arthroplasty. Significant increases in pulmonary-artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, accompanied by decreases in arterial oxygen tension and increases in intrapulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/Qt), characterized cardiopulmonary dysfunction after bilateral cemented arthroplasty when no lavage was used. Low-volume, low-pressure manual lavage did not significantly alter these physiological changes, but there was a significant reduction in the number of fat emboli that were demonstrated in the lungs as compared with the no-lavage group. High-volume, high-pressure pulsatile lavage of the intramedullary cavity after reaming significantly reduced the changes in pulmonary-artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, arterial oxygen tension, and intrapulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/Qt). In the pulsatile-lavage group, the number of fat microemboli that were found in the lungs was reduced to 25.7 per cent of those found in the no-lavage group. We concluded that meticulous high-volume, high-pressure pulsatile lavage reduces both pulmonary physiological derangements and fat emboli during bilateral cemented arthroplasty in dogs.\r"

  ".U": "90008951\r", 
  ".W": "Since 1984, we have used components made of titanium alloy for total joint arthroplasty. Recently, two patients needed revision hip arthroplasty, approximately three years after the initial procedure, because of aseptic loosening secondary to severe osteolysis that had been induced by metallic debris. Although implants made of titanium alloy have many favorable qualities--most importantly, superb biocompatibility--the alloy is more susceptible to wear by particles of acrylic cement and tends to generate more polyethylene wear than do components made of stainless steel or chromium-cobalt. A new process of implanting ions has reportedly improved resistance to wear as well as fatigue properties and has enhanced the resistance to corrosion of the implants. Although, to our knowledge, only in vitro studies of this process have been reported to date, we recommend avoiding the use of components made of titanium alloy in which ions have not been implanted. We suggest considering the possibility of osteolysis secondary to appreciable metallic debris in patients who have aseptic loosening of titanium-alloy components that were not implanted with ions.\r"

Fluoroscopically guided radiographs allowed accurate measurement of a lucent line that was one millimeter wide. Plain radiographs were inadequate for the detection and measurement of these lucent lines, leading to inaccuracy. Fluoroscopically guided radiographs also allowed measurement of the distance between the tibial component and radiopaque markers in the proximal part of the tibial metaphysis that was reproducible to within one-half millimeter. Plain radiographs did not provide a reproducible measurement of this distance. The relatively simple technique of fluoroscopically guided radiography is recommended to detect the presence and progression of radiolucent lines and the subsidence of uncemented tibial components after total knee arthroplasty.\r"

A concurrent dislocation or associated fracture was present in 14, 56, and 80 per cent of these patients, respectively. The outcome correlated well with the type of fracture. According to an objective elbow-performance index used to assess the results for the thirty-two patients who had at least one year of follow-up (mean, fifty months), 92 per cent of the patients who had a Type-I fracture, 73 per cent who had a Type-II fracture, and 20 per cent who had a Type-III fracture had a satisfactory result. Residual stiffness of the joint was most often present in patients who had a Type-III fracture. We recommend early motion within three weeks after injury for patients who have a Type-I or Type-II fracture. Reduction and fixation, followed by early motion when possible, may be the preferred treatment for patients who have a Type-III fracture.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the cases of twenty patients who had had an ipsilateral total knee arthroplasty or a contralateral total hip arthroplasty, or both, long after one hip had been fused in an acceptable position. Between 1972 and 1986, we performed twenty-one total joint arthroplasties (on thirteen hips and eight knees) and followed two additional patients (one hip and one knee) in whom the operation had been performed elsewhere. The average age of the patients at the time of arthroplasty was fifty-seven years (range, thirty-one to eighty-one years), and the average time from arthrodesis to arthroplasty was thirty-two years (range, eleven to fifty-four years). The results of eighteen of the twenty-three arthroplasties were evaluated at an average of seven years and nine months postoperatively. Four of the remaining five patients, who were followed for an average of eight years, died of a cause that was unrelated to the arthroplasty. After the hip arthroplasty, five hips were rated excellent; five, good; one, fair; and three, poor. Each hip that had a poor result was revised twice for mechanical loosening. Three hips for which the result was not considered poor had progressive radiolucency. After the knee arthroplasty, three knees were rated excellent; four, good; one, fair; and one, poor (because of infection). Seven knees were manipulated a total of fifteen times. Only one patient had progressive symptomatic radiolucency, nine years after the insertion of a posterior stabilized prosthesis. Clinically important ligamentous instability was not encountered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The meniscal tears did not heal in knees that were not immobilized, and they healed poorly and sporadically in knees that were immobilized in a cast but bore some weight. However, a higher percentage of tears that were treated by the core-removal or synovial-flap technique healed when the knee was firmly immobilized and weight-bearing was prevented by the use of an external skeletal fixator across the joint for eight to twelve weeks. Neovascularization and access to a source of reparative cells appear to be important in the healing process.\r"

Unexpectedly high localized contact pressures between the acetabular cartilage and the prosthesis were recorded. Early in the period of recovery, activities such as using a bedpan or performing isometric exercise produced pressures that were close to those recorded during normal walking. The highest pressure, eighteen megapascals, was recorded one year postoperatively, while the patient was rising from a chair. High pressures occurred in the superior and posterior aspects of the acetabulum.\r"

Five patients needed a repeat osteotomy of the tibia: four because the limb had spontaneously derotated toward the original position and one because the limb had had insufficient rotation at the time of operation. One patient had a disarticulation at the ankle after the first stage of a planned two-stage procedure because the mother was not happy with the child's appearance. In ten limbs, the distal femoral growth plate and epiphysis were removed and in two, the femoral epiphysis and growth plate and the tibial growth plate were removed so that the joint of the prosthetic knee would be positioned at the proper height at the completion of the child's growth. Neither growth plate was removed from one limb, the shorter one in the child who had bilateral involvement. A ten-point grading scale based on use and fit of the prosthesis, gait, range of motion of the ankle, use of external support, and final height of the ankle compared with that of the contralateral knee was used to evaluate the result, which was excellent in six patients, good in four, fair in one, and poor in one. One patient, who had a disarticulation at the ankle, was excluded from the final evaluation. Rotational osteotomy provided good function and acceptable cosmetic appearance in the patients who had unilateral involvement.\r"

However, to our knowledge, a similar association between ligamentous injuries of the knee and fracture of the tibial shaft has not been studied prospectively. To determine if there was such an association, a prospective study was conducted in which the knees of fifty patients who had a fracture of the ipsilateral tibial shaft of varying severity were examined manually while the patient was under general anesthesia. Eleven patients (22 percent) were found to have sustained an injury to at least one ligament of the knee that resulted in increased laxity of 2+ or more. One knee had dislocated. On the basis of the results of this study, we believe that, after stabilization of a fracture of the tibial shaft, it is essential to examine the knee thoroughly to identify any associated ligamentous injuries.\r"

The fractured malleolus was treated with rigid internal fixation, but the injury to the lateral ligaments was not diagnosed until the ankle was stressed to test for stability after the internal fixation. We believe that if disruption of the lateral ligaments is noted at operation, repair is indicated. This involves only a slight prolongation of time under anesthesia and markedly increases the chances for a stable ankle. It is important to check intraoperatively for a possible tear of the lateral ligaments in a patient who has a fracture of the ankle, especially when the injury was caused by high-energy trauma.\r"

The method of Youm et al. for determining the carpal height index was altered to include the use of defined points of reference and a standardized radiographic technique. Two tests of reproducibility demonstrated the reliability of the method. The carpal height index was found to be superior to the carpal height ratio for the evaluation of unilateral disease. The mean carpal height index of diseased wrists differed significantly from that of normal wrists. The carpal height index (for unilateral disease) or the carpal height ratio (for bilateral disease) can be used to describe the progression of collapse of the wrist quantitatively and to evaluate and compare various forms of treatment.\r"

Factors in the affected patients distinguishing them from those unaffected were sought. Total protein levels were found to be higher in the affected group. This may correlate with the calciuretic response to protein loading reported previously. Of the affected patients, four demonstrated extreme agitation and resisted physiotherapy. Only one of the 18 nonaffected patients was equally agitated and resistant (p less than 0.05). The additional joint trauma sustained by the affected patients may contribute to the development of heterotopic bone. In bone scans in 18 consecutive patients deemed to be at risk, all showed increased radioactivity at multiple joints. Only seven patients developed heterotopic bone. Bone scans are not sufficiently specific to be used as a diagnostic tool in detecting heterotopic bone.\r"

  ".W": "A bicycle ergometer modified for aquatic exercise was used to determine the effects of immersion on core temperature during submaximal exercise at different water temperatures. An exercise intensity (60% of maximal oxygen consumption) and duration (30 minutes) considered appropriate for cardiovascular conditioning were used. These data will be useful in cardiovascular and leg-strengthening hydrotherapy programs. Rectal temperature, skin temperature, and a rating of thermal comfort were studied in five normal men (14.8% +/- 5.6% fat) during headout immersion at water temperatures of 21.1 degrees, 25.3 degrees, and 29.4 degrees C and exercise in air of 21.1 degrees C. Subjects were immersed for 30 minutes during static and exercise (63% +/- 0.6% maximal oxygen consumption) conditions. Data were collected every 5 minutes and analyzed by repeated measured analysis of variance. At water temperatures, rectal temperature fell from control during static immersion (p less than or equal to 0.05) and was lower than control at the end of the 30-minute recovery period (p less than or equal to 0.05). During exercise there was no change in rectal temperature at water temperatures of 21.1 degrees and 25.3 degrees C; however, rectal temperature rose at water temperatures of 29.4 degrees (p less than or equal to 0.05) and air 21.1 degrees C (p less than or equal to 0.05). At the end of recovery rectal temperature was lower than control at water temperatures 21.1 degrees C (p less than or equal to 0.05) and greater than control at water temperatures 29.4 degrees C (p less than or equal to 0.05). There was no change from control in rectal temperatures at water temperatures 25.3 degrees C and air at 21.1 degrees C. These results indicate that immersion in 25.3 degrees and 21.1 degrees C water effectively attenuates the rise in rectal temperature during exercise at 63% of maximal oxygen consumption, whereas immersion in 29.4 degrees C water does not. In addition, both skin and rectal temperatures affect perception of thermal state but do not give the subjects an accurate estimation of thermal balance.\r"

Phase two, an environment evaluation, consisted of contacting consumer relation departments of major stove manufacturers suggesting a product safety review. The community response to this program has been favorable. Its design should provide the foundation for preventing increased incidence of cooking-related burn injuries.\r"

Twenty adult sheep were studied: six had halothane anesthesia alone and 14 had anesthesia and third-degree burns over 15% of the total body surface. Body temperatures were maintained within 1 degree C of baseline value during the operations. The burns on six sheep were totally excised and hide from donor sheep was grafted 3 hours after injury; in eight sheep, excision and grafting were done 5 days after injury. We found that 3 hours of anesthesia in controls decreased oxygen delivery (DO2) by 22% +/- 6% and oxygen consumption (VO2) by 30% +/- 7% from waking baseline values primarily because of a decrease in cardiac output as oxygen (O2) extraction from hemoglobin also decreased. However, no base deficit developed. DO2 and (VO2) transiently increased to 9% +/- 3% above baseline value on the sheeps' return to the waking state. Anesthesia and wound excision, which began 3 hours after the burns were formed, decreased DO2 and VO2 by 25% +/- 4% and 32% +/- 4%, respectively, despite baseline filling pressures. However, a base deficit of -3 +/- 1 mEq/L developed during the two-hour operations, which began with the administration of anesthesia alone. Oxygen consumption increased to 25% +/- 6% above the waking baseline value upon each subject's return to the waking state. In the sheep treated 5 days after burn injury, DO2 decreased by 35% +/- 6% and VO2 decreased by 42% +/- 6% below the value during the waking hypermetabolic state when the sheep were under anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After the scald injuries (10-second, full-thickness burns) were induced, a reduction in phagocytic activity by the spleen took place with an accompanying increase in the uptake of colloid material by the lungs. Uptake of colloid material by the liver was essentially unchanged. These uptake changes, observed within hours after the inducement of acute burn trauma and apparently continuing for 7 days after burn injury, may explain, in part, the development of septicemia in patients with burns because altered phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system can result in subsequent overabundance of microorganisms and bacteria in the blood.\r"

  ".W": "One portion of host defense to bacterial challenge(s) involves the activation and infiltration of endogenous polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Thermal injuries are frequently associated with immunologic abnormalities including alterations of polymorphonuclear leukocyte-associated nonspecific resistance. We examined isolated peripheral rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes for alterations in membrane potential, oxidative capability, and locomotor function after the experimental application of 20% full-thickness body surface area thermal injury. Thermal injury resulted in significant reductions of peripheral red blood cell concentration(s) and increases in leukocyte and platelet concentrations for 42 days after injury. In addition to the quantitative changes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes also demonstrated altered qualitative functions. Compared with phorbol myristate acetate-induced activation of normal cells, polymorphonuclear leukocyte membranes from thermal-injured animals were electrophysiologically less responsive for 3 weeks after injury. The ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to produce intracellular H2O2, a measure of oxidative function, was also significantly decreased for 7 days after injury. The paradox in this paradigm of thermal injury was the demonstration of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocyte quantitative increases with concurrent significant qualitative impairment. Qualitative lesions included altered states of membrane depolarization and depressed oxidative capability that may individually, or collectively, reduce nonspecific immune capabilities of the host to levels that are inadequate to combat infection.\r"

The results suggest that bleeding was diminished by 44% in contact laser surgery compared with the steel scalpel. Still the difference was not significant. There was no impairment of graft take after laser surgery compared with the steel scalpel. However, the laser method caused a significant increase (p less than 0.02) in operating time. The contact Nd: YAG laser can be recommended for excision of relatively small deep burn injuries, especially in areas in which bleeding is a problem with other methods.\r"

Median visual analog scale scores were 70% pain relief after the 2-hour loading infusion and 80% after 24 hours. Cardiovascular parameters were stable. There was a significant decrease in the respiratory rate of the patients. It appears that continuous intravenous methadone is an effective analgesic agent for the patient with acute, severe burns.

An incidence of leukopenia (WBC count less than or equal to 5000/mm3) was observed in of 40 (47.5%) patients treated with silver sulfadiazine and in 13 of 30 (43.3%) patients treated with silver nitrate.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of two new antimicrobial agents, ticarcillin and clavulanate (Timentin) and amoxicillin and clavulanate (Augmentin), in the infected thermal injury. The therapeutic results were compared with the model treated with the standard topical silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene). Seventy-six Sprague-Dawley rats received a 20% full-thickness thermal injury and were then divided into six treatment groups. Three of the groups were inoculated topically with 10(8) Pseudomonas aeruginosa/ml, and three of the groups received topical inoculation of 10(8) Staphylococcus aureus/ml. The groups inoculated with P. aeruginosa received either intraperitoneal Timentin, topical Silvadene, or placebo treatment. The groups inoculated with S. aureus were treated with either enteral Augmentin, topical Silvadene, or placebo. The animals received 10 days of therapy and underwent tissue biopsies on alternate days. Statistical analysis showed that the level of bacteria in the wounds compared with the control group was significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased for both antibiotics tested as measured by quantitative wound biopsies. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of systemic Timentin and Augmentin in the infected thermal injury.\r"

Vancomycin protein binding, as determined by ultrafiltration, averaged 29% +/- 6%. There was a strong (r = 0.92) relationship between percent protein-bound vancomycin and albumin. There was a poor statistical relationship between percent protein-bound vancomycin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (r = 0.28).

These patients had a mean age 71.8 years and a mean +/- SD burn size of 8.9% +/- 8.6%, with 36 patients having burns over greater than 10% of body surface area and 14 patients having burns over greater than 20%. The mean hospital stay of these patients was 16.9 days, and 75% of the patients required surgery to heal the burn wounds.

It resembles, but is distinguishable from, major depression. Two features of volitional collapse may sometimes be turned to therapeutic advantage: it releases the patient from a struggle that may be dissipating already depleted energy reserves, and it transfers survival responsibility from one who has given up to others who have not. Preferred treatment involves carefully orchestrated initiatives from the patient's physician, closest friend, and spouse; their leverage derives from traditional sources, most importantly psychologic transference, bonding, and conjugal commitment. A burn unit provides an ideal environment in which to study the disorder and its response to treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Many investigators have described a variety of immune phenomena associated with endometriosis. Among these are elevated titers of activated macrophages, monokines, and lymphokines in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. In 1980, Weed and Arquembourg first described the deposition of complement component C3 in epithelial cells of endometrial glands in patients with endometriosis. In this study our objective was to examine the synthesis and secretion of proteins by endometriotic tissue. Tissues were incubated in Minimal Essential Medium without methionine containing 50 microCi/mL [35S]methionine for 12-16 h at 37 C in 5% CO2-95% air. Twenty thousand trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were placed on a 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, and the radiolabeled proteins were detected by fluorography. We examined the radiolabeled secretory proteins obtained from 17 endometriotic implants and/or endometrioma cyst walls as well as 8 control tissues. A 180 kDa protein was produced in much greater quantities by endometriotic tissue than by control tissues. In the presence of reducing agent this protein dissociated into 113- and 69-kDa subunits. To identify and quantitate this protein we performed immunoprecipitations on the incubated medium using antihuman C3 immunoglobulin G. Up to 16% of the precipitable counts were recovered with this antibody from endometriotic tissue, while a maximum of only 4.6% was recovered from control tissue. In addition, we isolated and incubated the epithelial glandular cells, stromal cells, and remaining cells from two endometriomas. The great majority of the newly synthesized and secreted C3 was found in the glandular epithelial cell incubation. Up to 60% of the total precipitable counts were recovered from the glandular cells using this antibody. Only one protein was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitated protein had a mol wt of 180 kDa under nonreducing conditions and dissociated into two subunits of 113 and 69 kDa in the presence of dithiothreitol. We conclude that the glandular epithelial cells found in endometriotic implants produce and secrete complement component, C3 which could be responsible for many of the immunological phenomena now well described in endometriosis.\r"

Striking morphological differences existed between cultured cells from the two anatomical sites. Inhibition of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation by T3 and dexamethasone in these cultures was compared. Confluent cultures were labeled with [3H]acetate, and total [3H]GAG was quantitated. Fibroblasts from the skin responded to T3 (100 nmol/L) and dexamethasone (100 nmol/L) with 27% and 55% inhibition of [3H]GAG accumulation, respectively (n = 12). In contrast, retroocular fibroblasts responded with 12% and 8% inhibition (n = 6) to the two hormones. When cultures from abdominal skin and retroocular tissue were treated with n-butyrate (10 mM), a compound known to inhibit hyaluronate specifically, they responded similarly with 78% and 83% inhibition, respectively. A pulse-chase study was performed using fibroblasts from both sites, and no [3H]GAG degradation could be detected for the duration of the chase period (up to 72 h). These results suggest that retroocular fibroblasts, likely participants in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy, do not respond vigorously to T3 or glucocorticoids in terms of inhibition of [3H]GAG synthesis as do their dermal counterparts.\r"

Therefore, we tested the responsiveness of bone to PTH directly by using a 3-day iv infusion of bovine PTH-(1-34) at 400 U/day in 9 normal premenopausal women, 10 normal postmenopausal women, and 12 osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Serum calcium and urinary hydroxyproline concentrations increased (P less than 0.001) over baseline values during infusion, but the mean increases in both variables did not differ among groups. The data do not support the hypothesis that estrogen deficiency increases the sensitivity of bone to PTH or that the sensitivity in osteoporotic women is greater than that in normal postmenopausal women. Within the constraints imposed by the method of testing, we conclude that the additional bone resorption induced by menopause and by osteoporosis may be due to mechanisms that are not due to enhanced responsiveness of bone to PTH.\r"

Since CRH and ACTH are released in a pulsatile pattern in man, this study sought to investigate whether pulsatile administration of alpha-cosyntropin-(1-24) would lead to the maintenance of aldosterone stimulation over time. Eight normal male subjects on a 10-meq sodium, 100-meq potassium diet received both a continuous and a pulsatile (0.33 U ACTH/pulse over 15 min, pulsed every 2 h) infusion of cosyntropin (4 U/24 h) for 48 h (n = 4) or 72 h (n = 4). Aldosterone and cortisol were sampled every 6 h, and PRA and angiotensin-II every 24 h. Continuous infusion led to a stimulation of aldosterone followed by a progressive decline to preinfusion levels by 72 h [preinfusion 29 +/- 5 ng/dL (810 +/- 139 pmol/L); 72 h, 38 +/- 10 ng/dL (1054 +/- 277 pmol/L); P = 0.40]. Pulsatile infusion led to a stimulation of aldosterone which was maintained up to 72 h [preinfusion 33 +/- 7 ng/dL (915 +/- 194 pmol/L); 72 h, 85 +/- 13 ng/dL (2358 +/- 361 pmol/L); P less than 0.05]. Regression analysis of aldosterone (y) over time (x) from the peak level at 18 h for the continuous infusion showed a significant negative relation (r = 0.63; P = 0.001), indicating a progressive decline in aldosterone. However, for the pulsatile infusion, there was no relation (r = 0.02; P = 0.85), indicating maintenance of aldosterone levels. There were no significant differences in sodium, potassium, PRA, angiotensin-II, or cortisol between infusions to explain these differences in aldosterone levels. Therefore, pulsatile infusion of cosyntropin maintains aldosterone secretion over time.\r"

The fraction of DS metabolized to dehydroepiandrosterone (D), [rho]DS-D, was 0.285 +/- 0.044, and the fraction of D arising from DS (delta D) was 0.318 +/- 0.096, determined using isotopic techniques. Raising the plasma DS concentration by 8.6 micrograms/mL (23 mumol/L) by infusing DS iv increased the MCRDS to 24.49 L/day in the first subject, and raising the plasma DS by 11.40 +/- 0.33 micrograms/mL (30.94 +/- 0.90 mumol/L) in the next three subjects raised the MCRDS to 35.7 +/- 1.3 L/day (P less than 0.01) without changing the MCRE1. The increase in MCRDS produced by increasing plasma DS makes it difficult to accurately measure the MCRDS in effect at the subject's endogenous plasma DS concentration by infusion of nonisotopic DS. Determination of the fractions of D, androstenedione (delta delta 4A), and testosterone (T) arising from DS using the increase in the plasma concentrations of these steroids produced by infusion of nonisotopic DS gave the following estimates: delta D = 0.262 +/- 0.042, delta delta 4A = 0.089 +/- 0.046, and delta T = 0.273 +/- 0.14.\r"

Serum MT concentrations displayed a normal diurnal rhythm, resembling that of nongravid women; the mean concentration [163.8 +/- 149.6 (+/- SD) pmol/L] at night was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than that during the day (31.4 +/- 16.3 pmol/L). The amniotic fluid MT concentration, which showed a significant positive correlation to the serum MT concentration (r = 0.625; P less than 0.01), also showed an obvious diurnal rhythm; the mean MT concentration was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher during the night [99.3 +/- 59.3 (+/- SD) pmol/L] than during the day (58.9 +/- 33.5 pmol/L). Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography confirmed that the amniotic fluid MT immunoreactivity eluated as synthetic MT. During the night the mean amniotic fluid MT concentration [99.3 +/- 59.3 (+/- SD) pmol/L] was significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than that in serum (178.9 +/- 189.6 pmol/L). The progress of delivery, estimated by cervical dilatation, did not affect serum MT concentrations. Induction of delivery by amniotomy and/or oxytocin, and operative delivery by cesarean section had no effect on serum MT concentrations. Human MT secretion does not seem to be influenced by the physical stress of labor or endocrine changes associated with parturition. The single factor regulating MT secretion during human delivery appears to be the time of day.\r"

On the basis of prior selection by RIA, Mab 5B4 was known to be directed to the N-terminal of hGH and was able to detect both pituitary and placental hGH, since their primary amino acid sequences are identical in this domain. Mab K24 was directed to an epitope present in hGH, but not in placental hGH, and was able to detect pituitary hGH only; neither the 5B4 or K24 Mab detected human placental lactogen. Five placentas were studied from women at term after elective cesarean section without labor. The cells of the anterior pituitary gland and the syncytiotrophoblast of the placental villi were stained with Mab 5B4, whereas K24 only stained the pituitary cells; results consistent with the RIA screen. Mab 5B4 specifically stained two different cell types in the placental basal plate. Neither antiserum stained any cell in the amniotic or chorionic membranes or the adherent decidua. The results demonstrate that pituitary hGH and placental hGH are expressed uniquely in the pituitary and fetal placenta, respectively. In addition, the placental hGH gene is also expressed in the placental basal plate, a region of mixed fetal and maternal cells.\r"

Midthigh muscle areas, assessed by computer tomography, increased in all seven hyperthyroid and decreased in three of four hypothyroid patients investigated after treatment of the thyroid disease. Peak torque and total work output, assessed by an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex II), increased in both groups of patients. The muscle efficiency (total work output per cm2 muscle) increased in all patients after therapy [mean +/- SD values before vs. after therapy in hyperthyroid patients, 17.6 +/- 5.3 vs. 30.5 +/- 3.7 joules (J)/cm2 (P less than 0.001); in hypothyroid patients, 12.8 +/- 6.1 J/cm2 vs. 25.8 +/- 8.6 J/cm2 (P less than 0.05)].

  ".W": "Forty-eight female patients with postmenopausal osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated with sodium fluoride and calcium supplements; their response to treatment was documented by sequential measurements of vertebral and forearm bone mineral density (BMD). During treatment 25 patients developed significant side-effects due to fluoride, and ultimately, 18 patients (37%) were intolerant of the drug after 17.3 +/- 7.3 (+/- SD) months. The remaining patients were followed for 29.4 +/- 9.6 months. By linear regression analysis, 69% of patients had a positive slope of vertebral BMD vs. time of greater than 0.0017 g/cm2.month (range, 0.0017-0.01) and were classified as treatment responders. The increment in vertebral BMD above the baseline value over time was described by the relationship delta BMD (g/cm2.month) = 0.042 + 0.0053 x months, equivalent to a rate of 8.4%/yr. Because the rates of increasing BMD were very variable, it was difficult to determine in individual patients the point at which a positive response to treatment had occurred; by calculating the 95% confidence target BMD by which the BMD must rise above the initial value before discounting the imprecision of the measurements (0.062 g/cm2), only 70% of responders were identified by 12 months. The total cumulative dose of sodium fluoride (31.3 +/- 16.4 g) was significantly higher in patients classified as responders than in the nonresponders (20.6 +/- 13.4 g; P less than 0.05), probably because of differences in side-effects between the two groups. In contrast, forearm BMD fell significantly in the responders by an average of 7.7%/yr, suggesting the possibility of a preferential improvement in axial bone density at the expense of cortical bone. Thus, the majority of patients treated with fluoride respond with increasing vertebral BMD, but it may take 12-24 months to identify these individually.\r"

Thyroid tissues and peripheral blood were obtained at the time of subtotal thyroidectomy of 27 Graves' patients who had been treated with thionamide drugs and iodide before operation. Two intrathyroidal mononuclear cell populations were obtained from these thyroid tissues. One cell population was isolated from the supernatants after mechanical disaggregation of the tissues and was defined as TG-1 cells. Another cell population, defined as TG-2 cells, was isolated from the supernatants of overnight cultures of the thyroid debris after enzymatic digestion. The percentages of B lymphocytes bearing activated markers and plasma cells (CD20+CD21-, IgM+IgD-, CD20+ transferrin receptor+, PCA-1+) were significantly higher in the TG-1 and TG-2 cell populations than in peripheral blood from Graves' disease patients and normal subjects. These phenotypic changes were accompanied by increased thyroid gland B lymphocyte cell size from patients with Graves' disease. The proliferative response of B lymphocytes to SAC was markedly lower in TG-1 and TG-2 cell populations than in peripheral blood cells from Graves' disease patients and normal subjects. B lymphocytes isolated from thyroid glands secreted significantly more IgG and antithyroidal autoantibodies than those from peripheral blood. Based on the findings of abnormalities in thyroid-infiltrating B lymphocytes, we suggest that activated B lymphocytes may induce the excessive production of antithyroidal autoantibodies in thyroid glands from patients with Graves' disease.\r"

Chr-A was measured in plasma samples from 55 controls and 73 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism caused by adenoma (n = 14), sporadic or familial hyperplasia (n = 10), or familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (FMEN1; n = 49). Serum or plasma samples were also tested for calcium, PTH, gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, CG alpha, and PRL. Plasma Chr-A was 34 +/- 10 in parathyroid adenoma, 55 +/- 33 in parathyroid hyperplasia without FMEN1, 63 +/- 88 in FMEN1, and 25 +/- 8 in controls (mean +/- SD; nanograms per ml; FMEN1 or parathyroid hyperplasia vs. control, P less than 0.05). Plasma Chr-A did not correlate with other hormonal variables in controls. Plasma Chr-A correlated with log serum gastrin (r = 0.43; P = 0.003) and plasma PTH (r = 0.52; P less than 0.05) only in FMEN1. In FMEN1, plasma Chr-A was highest in subjects with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES, 120 +/- 127; no ZES, 30 +/- 33 (P less than 0.0001). Parathyroidectomy did not decrease plasma Chr-A in patients with parathyroid adenoma or parathyroid hyperplasia. For FMEN1 patients with available pre- and postparathyroidectomy samples, Chr-A decreased postoperatively in four of five patients with ZES compared to none of six patients without ZES (P less than 0.05). Elevated plasma Chr-A is not a general feature of primary hyperparathyroidism. Elevated plasma Chr-A in primary hyperparathyroidism was restricted principally to patients who also had ZES. Primary hyperparathyroidism may influence the level of Chr-A by an effect of hypercalcemia or elevated PTH on Chr-A secretion from pancreatic islet tissue.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that relaxin may affect pituitary hormone secretion, synthetic human relaxin was infused into cycling and pregnant rhesus monkeys. Doses ranging from 0.154-1540 ng/kg.min were calculated to achieve circulating relaxin concentrations of 1 pM to 10 nM. Low (0.154 and 1.54 ng/kg.min), intermediate (15.4 and 154 ng/kg.min), and high (1540 ng/kg.min) doses of relaxin were infused for 15 min each hour into ovulating monkeys at the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle in two separate experiments. Serum GH and PRL were measured by RIA, and serum relaxin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relaxin was undetectable in peripheral plasma during the control saline infusion and during infusion of the lowest dose of relaxin. Serum relaxin levels reached 0.011, 0.119, 0.965, and 13.0 nM with 1.54, 15.4, 154, and 1540 ng/kg.min, respectively. Serum GH was significantly elevated over basal levels upon infusion of relaxin from 1.54-1540 ng/kg.min; however, a plateau was observed with the intermediate doses, and a decrease in the magnitude of the response was observed at the highest dose. Serum PRL increased over basal levels with 15.4 and 154 ng/kg.min, but there was no difference in the magnitude of the increase between these doses. PRL levels during infusion of the highest dose of relaxin were similar to control levels. These data suggest that relaxin can stimulate secretion of GH and PRL in cycling monkeys within a defined dose range, but that a decrease in pituitary responsiveness occurs at higher doses. One high dose of relaxin (2600 ng/kg.min) was infused for 1 h into the maternal and then the fetal circulations of chronically catheterized and tethered pregnant monkeys between 120-140 days gestation. Upon infusion of relaxin into the maternal circulation, there was a significant elevation of PRL in the mother but not the fetus. Upon infusion of relaxin into the fetus, there was no consistent change in PRL secretion in either the mother or the fetus. In conclusion, relaxin may have a heretofore undescribed role in pituitary physiology during the menstrual cycle and in pregnancy.\r"

Similar studies were conducted with Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes collected from six African pygmies. When transformed B-lymphocytes from normal stature subjects were cultured for 3 weeks in RPMI-1640 medium (6 x 10(3) cells/75-cm2 flask at seeding), significant amounts of IGF-I, but no IGF-II, were produced. GH (150 ng/mL) significantly increased for control cells the amount of IGF-I produced at each sampling interval compared to that by unstimulated cultures (P less than 0.05 at 1 week; P = 0.005 at 3 weeks). At 3 weeks, cell counts of cultures compared were 4.13 +/- 0.39 X 10(6)/mL for unstimulated cells and 4.23 +/- 0.87 X 10(6)/mL for GH-stimulated cells. IGF-I production at this time interval by unstimulated cells was 2.8 +/- 2.3 ng/mL, and that by GH-stimulated cells was 12.3 +/- 2.5 ng/mL (P = 0.005). Cell multiplication rates of control cultures were increased in 1 week by GH stimulation [GH stimulated, [16.7 +/- 22.0 X 10(4) cells, unstimulated, 5.73 +/- 4.1 X 10(4) cells; (mean +/- SD); n = 14; P less than 0.01]. Similar results occurred with GH studied at a lower concentration of 10 ng/mL for 3 weeks. Freshly isolated B-lymphocytes did not secrete IGF-I and II after 5 days of culture with GH. Cultures established from cells derived from pygmies produced significantly less IGF-I (4.24 +/- 2.62 ng/mL) when stimulated with 150 ng/mL GH than cultures of cells from normal stature subjects (12.3 +/- 2.5 ng/mL; 0.005 less than P less than 0.01). The cultures compared had a similar cell density. A similar significant difference in IGF-I secretion occurred between cultures of pygmy and control cells stimulated with 10 ng/mL GH. These data are consistent with previous in vivo studies in which pygmies failed to increase IGF-I and exhibit metabolic responses to exogenous GH.\r"

  ".U": "90009220\r", 
  ".W": "TSH from human serum was separated into classes by serial lectin affinity chromatography using Concanavalin-A (ConA), lentil, and ricin lectins. TSH from 10 euthyroid subjects, 40 patients with primary hypothyroidism, and 1 patient with central hypothyroidism was studied. The patterns of ConA and lentil affinity binding were similar for diverse patients; forms of TSH that bound firmly to ConA also tended to bind firmly to lentil. Differences in TSH-ricin binding suggested that there were differences in the sialylation of TSH in sera of euthyroid, primary, and central hypothyroidism patients. For euthyroid subjects, 16.1 +/- 5.4% (mean +/- SD) of the TSH bound to ricin, while after neuraminidase treatment, 38.4 +/- 5.4% bound. For patients with primary hypothyroidism, 23.5 +/- 6.0% of the TSH bound to the ricin, while after neuraminidase treatment, 65.7 +/- 8.8% bound. The increase in ricin binding induced by neuraminidase treatment was significantly higher for TSH from patients with primary hypothyroidism than in that from euthyroid subjects (42.3 +/- 7.6% vs. 22.3 +/- 4.4%; P less than 0.01) and was greater for long term than for short term hypothyroid patients (49.5 +/- 5.0% vs. 36.5 +/- 6.5%; P less than 0.01). While 30% of native TSH from the serum of the patient with central hypothyroidism bound to ricin, the amount bound increased only 17.6% after neuraminidase treatment. McKenzie bioassay of pituitary-derived TSH that was similarly fractionated using ricin failed to show detectable differences in bioactivity among the lectin column fractions. Thus, 1) circulating human TSH can be consistently separated into discrete classes using serial lectin affinity chromatography; 2) there is relatively more core fucosylation of the less processed high mannose and hybrid forms of TSH and less core fucosylation of more processed complex forms; 3) ConA and lentil binding of TSH in primary and central hypothyroidism is similar to that in the euthyroid state; 4) patients with primary hypothyroidism have more sialylated TSH than a patient with central hypothyroidism or euthyroid subjects; and 5) the degree of TSH sialylation increases with prolonged primary hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".U": "90009294\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to gain insight into the pathophysiology of pure osmotic diarrhea and the osmotic diarrhea caused by carbohydrate malabsorption. Diarrhea was induced in normal volunteers by ingestion of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is nonabsorbable, not metabolized by colonic bacteria, and carries no electrical charge. In PEG-induced diarrhea, (a) stool weight was directly correlated with the total mass of PEG ingested; (b) PEG contributed 40-60% of the osmolality of the fecal fluid, the remainder being contributed by other solutes either of dietary, endogenous, or bacterial origin; and (c) fecal sodium, potassium, and chloride were avidly conserved by the intestine, in spite of stool water losses exceeding 1,200 g/d. Diarrhea was also induced in normal subjects by ingestion of lactulose, a disaccharide that is not absorbed by the small intestine but is metabolized by colonic bacteria. In lactulose-induced diarrhea, (a) a maximum of approximate 80 g/d of lactulose was metabolized by colonic bacteria to noncarbohydrate moieties such as organic acids; (b) the organic acids were partially absorbed in the colon; (c) unabsorbed organic acids obligated the accumulation of inorganic cations (Na greater than Ca greater than K greater than Mg) in the diarrheal fluid; (d) diarrhea associated with low doses of lactulose was mainly due to unabsorbed organic acids and associated cations, whereas with larger doses of lactulose unmetabolized carbohydrates also played a major role; and (e) the net effect of bacterial metabolism of lactulose and partial absorption of organic acids on stool water output was done dependent. With low or moderate doses of lactulose, stool water losses were reduced by as much as 600 g/d (compared with equimolar osmotic loads of PEG); with large dose, the increment in osmotically active solutes within the lumen exceeded the increment of the ingested osmotic load, and the severity of diarrhea was augmented.\r"

At presentation the mean aspartate transaminase (AST) was 1,844 +/- 1,246 U/liter, bilirubin 232 +/- 135 mumol/liter, prothrombin time (PT) 34 +/- 18, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 73 +/- 26 s, and coagulation Factors V and VII 8 +/- 4 and 9 +/- 5%, respectively. Intravenous PGE1 was initiated 24-48 h later after a rise in AST (2,195 +/- 1,810), bilirubin (341 +/- 148), PT (36 +/- 15), and PTT (75 +/- 18). 12 of 17 responded rapidly with a decrease in AST from 1,540 +/- 833 to 188 +/- 324 U/liter. Improvement in hepatic synthetic function was indicated by a decrease in PT from 27 +/- 7 to 12 +/- 1 s and PTT from 61 +/- 10 to 31 +/- 2 s, and an increase in Factor V from 9 +/- 4 to 69 +/- 18% and Factor VII from 11 +/- 5 to 71 +/- 20%. Five responders with NANB hepatitis relapsed upon discontinuation of therapy, with recurrence of HE and increases in AST and PT, and improvement was observed upon retreatment. After 4 wk of intravenous therapy oral PGE2 was substituted. Two patients with NANB hepatitis recovered completely and remained in remission 6 and 12 mo after cessation of therapy. Two additional patients continued in remission after 2 and 6 mo of PGE2. No relapses were seen in the patients with hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus infection. Liver biopsies in all 12 surviving patients returned to normal. In the five nonresponders an improvement in hepatic function was indicated by a fall in AST (3,767 +/- 2,611 to 2,142 +/- 2,040 U/liter), PT (52 +/- 25 to 33 +/- 18 s), and PTT (103 +/- 29 to 77 +/- 44 s), but all deteriorated and died of cerebral edema (n = 3) or underwent liver transplantation (n = 2). These results suggest efficacy of PGE for FHF, and further investigation is warranted.\r"

It has previously been found that patients with IgAN have a higher than normal IgA response to vaccination, but the IgA subclasses have not been studied. To investigate whether the IgA hyperresponsiveness is limited to the subclass IgA1, which is involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN, we compared the immune responses of 18 patients with 22 healthy controls after intramuscular vaccination with inactivated influenza virus. Antibody titers were significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) for the IgA1 subclass in patients versus controls, but not for the other isotypes. A substantial portion of the IgA and IgA1 antiinfluenza immune response comprised polymers in both patients and controls. There was no preferential response of polymers in patients. Patients produced significantly more monomeric IgA1 antibodies than controls. These results show that patients with IgAN have a hyperresponsiveness limited to the subclass IgA1 and mainly expressed by an excess of monomers.\r"

  ".W": "Three lines of evidence are presented that low density lipoproteins gently extracted from human and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions (lesion LDL) greatly resembles LDL that has been oxidatively modified in vitro. First, lesion LDL showed many of the physical and chemical properties of oxidized LDL, properties that differ from those of plasma LDL: higher electrophoretic mobility, a higher density, higher free cholesterol content, and a higher proportion of sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine in the phospholipid fraction. A number of lower molecular weight fragments of apo B were found in lesion LDL, similar to in vitro oxidized LDL. Second, both the intact apo B and some of the apo B fragments of lesion LDL reacted in Western blots with antisera that recognize malondialdehyde-conjugated lysine and 4-hydroxynonenal lysine adducts, both of which are found in oxidized LDL; plasma LDL and LDL from normal human intima showed no such reactivity. Third, lesion LDL shared biological properties with oxidized LDL: compared with plasma LDL, lesion LDL produced much greater stimulation of cholesterol esterification and was degraded more rapidly by macrophages. Degradation of radiolabeled lesion LDL was competitively inhibited by unlabeled lesion LDL, by LDL oxidized with copper, by polyinosinic acid and by malondialdehyde-LDL, but not by native LDL, indicating uptake by the scavenger receptor(s). Finally, lesion LDL (but not normal intimal LDL or plasma LDL) was chemotactic for monocytes, as is oxidized LDL. These studies provide strong evidence that atherosclerotic lesions, both in man and in rabbit, contain oxidatively modified LDL.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the binding of thrombin, a serine protease with central roles in hemostasis, to the subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by cultured endothelial cells. This substrate provides a thrombogenic surface where hemostasis is initiated. Binding was saturable and equilibrium was achieved after 3 h incubation with 125I-alpha-thrombin. Scatchard analysis of thrombin binding revealed the presence of 5.1 X 10(9) binding sites per squared millimeter ECM, with an apparent Kd of 13 nM. The catalytically blocked enzyme, diisofluorophosphate (DIP)-alpha-thrombin competed efficiently with 125I-alpha-thrombin, indicating that the binding was independent of its catalytic site. Moreover, high concentrations of the synthetic tetradecapeptide, representing residues 367-380 of thrombin B chain (the macrophage mitogenic domain of thrombin), competed with thrombin binding to ECM, indicating that the binding site may reside in the vicinity of \"loop B\" region. Thrombin binds to dermatan sulfate in the ECM, as demonstrated by the inhibition of 125I-alpha-thrombin binding to ECM pretreated with chondroitinase ABC, but not with heparitinase or chondroitinase AC. This stands in contrast to 125I-FGF (fibroblast growth factor) binding to ECM, which was inhibited by heparitinase but not by chondroitinase ABC, ECM-bound thrombin exhibits an exposed proteolytic site as monitored by the Chromozyme TH assay and by its ability to convert fibrinogen to a fibrin clot and to induce platelet activation as indicated by 14C-serotonin release. ECM-bound thrombin failed to form a complex with its major circulating inhibitor-antithrombin III (AT III), compared with rapid complex formation with soluble thrombin. We propose that thrombin binds to subendothelial ECM where it remains functionally active, localized, and protected from inactivation by circulating inhibitors.\r"

An ELISA for bombesin-like peptides (BLP) has been devised using the MAb BBC353, which is specific for the biologically active carboxy-terminal fragment shared by all known BLP. Using this ELISA, we measured bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid levels of BLP in normal cigarette smokers (n = 15) and normal nonsmokers (n = 18). Smokers' BAL fluid contained increased levels of BLP, whether expressed in terms of BAL fluid volume (P = 0.0001) or protein content (P less than 0.05). BLP levels did not correlate with any cellular constituent in the BAL fluid but immunostaining of lung tissue with BBC353 revealed an intense specific staining of neuroendocrine cells, implying these as a potential source. Two peaks of bombesin-like immunoreactivity were purified using sequential reverse phase and gel filtration HPLC. Both BLP have apparent molecular weights similar to gastrin-releasing peptide on gel filtration HPLC analysis. However, the amino acid composition of these BLP is different from that of gastrin-releasing peptide or neuromedin B, the only known mammalian forms of BLP, suggesting either incomplete purification or novel peptides. Sequence analysis could not be performed due to blocking groups at the amino terminus of these peptides. Our data demonstrate that cigarette smoking is associated with increased levels of pulmonary BLP and imply a potential role for these neuropeptides in the lung's response to tobacco smoke.\r"

  ".W": "B19 parvovirus has been shown to persist in some immunocompromised patients, and treatment with specific antibodies can lead to decreased quantities of circulating virus and hematologic improvement. A defective immune response to B19 parvovirus in these patients was shown by comparison of results using a capture RIA and immunoblotting. In normal individuals, examination of paired sera showed that the dominant humoral immune response during early convalescence was to the virus major capsid protein (58 kD) and during late convalescence to the minor capsid species (83 kD). In patients with persistent parvovirus infection, variable titers against intact particles were detected by RIA, but the sera from these patients had minimal or no IgG to capsid proteins determined by Western analysis. Competition experiments suggested that this discrepancy was not explicable on the basis of immune complex formation alone and that these patients may have a qualitative abnormality in antibody binding to virus. In neutralization experiments, in which erythroid colony formation in vitro was used as an assay of parvovirus activity, sera from patients with poor reactivity on immunoblotting were also inadequate in inhibiting viral infectivity. A cellular response to purified B19 parvovirus could not be demonstrated using proliferation assays and PBMC from individuals with serologic evidence of exposure to virus. These results suggest that production of neutralizing antibody to capsid protein plays a major role in limiting parvovirus infection in man.\r"

  ".W": "Rats that underwent adrenal demedullation had a 93% decrease in plasma epinephrine (E) levels, but did not decrease their renal E. Even further treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine and reserpine failed to lower renal E levels. Similarly, urine E levels failed to decrease after adrenal demedullation and renal denervation. There is a renal E-synthesizing enzyme that differs from adrenal phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in that it is only weakly inhibited by SKF 29661 and can synthesize epinine from dopamine, while adrenal PNMT does so poorly. When an adrenalectomized rat received intravenous [3H]methionine, its urine contained radioactivity that appeared to be [3H]E, with small amounts of [3H]epinine. However, after [3H]methionine was infused in the renal artery, the major product in urine appeared to be [3H]epinine, with a small amount of [3H]E. Adrenal demedullation induced renal E synthesis, but denervation returned the rate of renal E synthesis to control values. The combination of adrenal demedullation, 6-hydroxydopamine, and reserpine treatments increased renal E-forming activity to 350% of control. We conclude that appreciable portions of renal and urinary E are synthesized in the kidney by an enzyme distinct from PNMT. The enzyme is induced by some treatments that lower E and NE levels.\r"

However, the basic mechanism by which plaque rupture leads to a growing thrombus in the vicinity of stenotic lesions is not well understood. Using a characterized flow chamber in a rheologically controlled system, we have mimicked stenotic vessels and studied for the first time cell-vessel wall interaction in nonparallel streamlines. Stenoses ranging from 0 to 80% were produced with stripped tunica media to mimic severe vessel wall damage, and perfused with heparinized flowing blood. This perfusion device was placed within an extracorporeal system in swine, and blood was perfused for selected times from 1 to 30 min. Platelet deposition on the surface was evaluated by 111Indium-labeled platelets. As percent stenosis increased, platelet deposition significantly increased (P less than 0.001), indicating a shear-induced cell activation. Analysis of the axial distribution of platelet deposition indicated that the apex, and not the flow recirculation zone distal to the apex, was the segment of greater platelet accumulation within 30 min of blood perfusion (P less than 0.001). These results also indicate that the severity of the acute platelet response to plaque rupture probably depends on the location of the rupture with relation to the apex of the plaque.\r"

We have administered aerosols of plasma-derived human alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI) to the lungs of dogs and sheep to investigate (a) delivery of the protein to the distal air spaces of the lung; (b) maintenance of functional activity of the protein; and (c) flux of the protein across the components of the alveolar-capillary membrane. A1PI (26.4 mg/kg body weight) was administered as an aerosol to anesthetized animals; sheep were prepared for the chronic collection of lung lymph. Immunoperoxidase staining of lung tissue obtained 2 h after administration of A1PI demonstrated the presence of human A1PI on the surface of alveoli and distal bronchioles. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid recovered at intervals after A1PI administration demonstrated time-dependent elevations of human A1PI levels with augmentation of lavage fluid antielastase activity in proportion to the content of human A1PI. Using radiolabeled A1PI as a tracer, we found that 32% of the aerosol was retained in the animals' lungs. Measurements of the rate of loss of A1PI from the lung and of the rate of appearance of human A1PI in plasma resulted in a calculated permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane to A1PI of 3.49-6.39 X 10(-10) cm/s. Experiments using instrumented sheep allowed independent calculation of endothelial permeability to A1PI of 122-236 X 10(-10) cm/s and calculation of epithelial permeability of 4.70-4.81 X 10(-10) cm/s. Modeling of aerosol delivery of A1PI to humans using the results of these studies predicts that the ratio of plasma/alveolar levels of delivered A1PI will be 0.024, and that aerosolization of 175 mg A1PI/d will result in an A1PI alveolar fluid level of 1.0 mg/ml. Aerosol administration of A1PI may provide an efficient method of augmenting alveolar antiprotease levels.\r"

  ".W": "The tissue uptake of extensively plasma-bound compounds is reportedly inconsistent with the conventional free-drug hypothesis limiting transport to unbound moiety in rapid intracapillary equilibrium with bound complex. Instead, protein-mediated/cell surface enhancement of dissociation has been postulated to occur in the microvasculature. This possibility was investigated by studying the passive transport of diazepam across the blood-brain barrier. Microdialysis probes placed within the vena cava and brain cortex were used to directly compare steady-state, interstitial unbound diazepam levels in both Wistar and genetically analbuminemic rats. The absence of albumin in the latter increased the unbound fraction of diazepam by almost fivefold; however, in both groups, the ratio of unbound concentrations in brain and blood at equilibrium was equal to unity. If enhanced dissociation occurred in the microvasculature, then the unbound brain level should have been greater than that in the systemic circulation. It is probable that earlier findings suggestive of protein-mediated transport reflect a nonequilibrium phenomenon. Comparison of the extent of diazepam's in vivo binding in blood by microdialysis to that estimated in vitro using conventional equilibrium dialysis with microcells showed good agreement, thus validating a widely accepted assumption of equivalency of these two values.\r"

Cyst fluid from a total of 357 renal cysts was obtained by either in vivo aspiration or immediately after nephrectomy. The cysts contained variable concentrations of bioactive EPO from undectable values up to 3.2 U/ml. A pronounced enrichment of EPO was observed in cysts with sodium concentrations greater than 100 mmol/liter, suggesting an association with proximal tubular malformations. The EPO concentrations in the cysts were neither correlated with the protein concentration nor with the oxygen pressure of the cyst fluid. Using a cDNA probe for human EPO, mRNA for EPO was localized in stroma cells of the cyst walls by an in situ hybridization technique. Our findings suggest that single interstitial cells juxtaposed to proximal tubular cysts may produce EPO independent of the oxygen pressure inside the cysts, which ameliorates the anemia during end-stage polycystic kidney disease.\r"

  ".W": "Carnitine metabolism has been previously shown to change with exercise in normal subjects, and in patients with ischemic muscle diseases. To characterize carnitine metabolism further during exercise, six normal male subjects performed constant-load exercise on a bicycle ergometer on two separate occasions. Low-intensity exercise was performed for 60 min at a work load equal to 50% of the lactate threshold, and high-intensity exercise was performed for 30 min at a work load between the lactate threshold and maximal work capacity for the individual. Low-intensity exercise was not associated with a change in muscle (vastus lateralis) carnitine metabolism. In contrast, from rest to 10 min of high-intensity exercise, muscle short-chain acylcarnitine content increased 5.5-fold while free carnitine content decreased 66%, and muscle total carnitine content decreased by 19% (all P less than 0.01). These changes in skeletal muscle carnitine metabolism were present at the completion of 30 min of high-intensity exercise, and persisted through a 60-min recovery period. With 30 min of high-intensity exercise, plasma short-chain and long-chain acylcarnitine concentrations increased by 46% and 23%, respectively. Neither exercise state was associated with a change in the urine excretion rates of free carnitine or acylcarnitines. Thus, alterations in skeletal muscle carnitine metabolism, characterized by an increase in acylcarnitines and a decrease in free and total carnitine, are dependent on the work load and, therefore, the metabolic state associated with the exercise, and are poorly reflected in the plasma and urine carnitine pools.\r"

  ".W": "These studies test the hypothesis that a major determinant of excessive biliary cholesterol secretion is a level of hepatic sterol synthesis that is inappropriately high relative to the needs of the liver cell for preserving cholesterol balance. Biliary cholesterol secretion was measured in vivo in two models after loading the hepatocyte with sterol by two different mechanisms. In the first model, cholesterol was delivered physiologically to the liver in chylomicron remnants. This resulted in a sixfold increase in cholesteryl ester content and marked suppression of cholesterol synthesis, but biliary cholesterol secretion remained essentially constant. In the second model, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase levels in the liver were markedly increased by chronic mevinolin (lovastatin) administration. Withdrawal of the inhibitor resulted in a sudden fivefold increase in the rate of sterol synthesis in the liver of the experimental animals that was inappropriately high for cellular needs. This excessive synthesis, in turn, was accompanied by a fivefold increase in the cholesteryl ester content, enrichment of microsomal membranes with cholesterol and, most importantly, by a threefold increase in the rate of biliary sterol secretion. As the rate of sterol synthesis gradually returned to normal over 48 h, the cholesterol ester content, the lipid composition of the microsomal membranes, and rate of cholesterol secretion into bile also returned to baseline values. These results further support the concept of functional compartmentalization of cholesterol in the hepatocyte. Derangements that cause an inappropriately high rate of sterol synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum may lead to an expansion of that pool of cholesterol that is recruitable by bile acids and, hence, to greater situation of the bile.\r"

The phorbol ester PMA coordinately upregulates lectin activity and binding to the PNHEV in the human T-lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat but not in the less phenotypically mature lines HSB2, Molt4, CEM, and HPB-ALL. In contrast, expression of CD18, CD2, and several common epitopes of the putative adhesion receptor gp90Hermes (CD44) did not correlate with attachment to PNHEV in this series of cell lines. Insensitivity to inhibition by the CD18 MAb TS 1.18, temperature and divalent cation requirements further distinguish the Jurkat-PNHEV adhesive interaction from CD11a/18- and CD2-mediated adhesion. The PMA-induced phenotypic changes in the Jurkat line parallel late thymocyte differentiation as well as lymphocyte activation, suggesting that expression of the endothelial-binding lectin may be linked to one or both of these processes. The lectin-like activity on Jurkat cells is functionally indistinguishable from those previously linked to PNHEV recognition in normal human lymphocytes, normal rat lymphocytes and both normal and malignant murine lymphoid cells. In the mouse, this activity is either contained in or functionally linked to a member of the LEC-CAM family gp90Mel14, suggesting that Jurkat cells express the human homologue of the murine nodal homing receptor. Thus cultured T lymphoblastic malignancies express a variety of potential endothelial adhesion molecules but use primarily a highly conserved surface lectin to interact with PNHEV.\r"

The patients had very different phenotypes. One patient with OI type I had a population of alpha 1(I) chains in which glycine at position 94 of the triple helix was substituted by cysteine; a patient with OI type III had a population of alpha 1(I) chains in which glycine at position 526 of the triple helix was substituted by cysteine; and the third patient, with OI type II, had a cysteine for glycine substitution at position 718 of the alpha 1(I) chain. From all three patients, molecules that contained two mutant chains formed interchain, intramolecular disulfide bonds, and although less stable to thermal denaturation than normal molecules, they were more stable than molecules that contained only a single mutant chain. These findings indicate that substitutions for glycine within the triple-helical domain of the alpha 1(I) chain are not invariably lethal and that their phenotypic effect largely depends on the nature of the substituting residue and its location in the chain.\r"

This mutation leads to the introduction of a premature termination codon (TAA) at a position corresponding to amino acid 37 of mature apo C-II and to the formation of a new Rsa I restriction enzyme site not present in the normal apo C-II gene. Amplification of DNA from family members by the polymerase chain reaction and digestion with Rsa I established that the patient is a true homozygote for the mutation. Analysis of the patient's plasma by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting detected an apo C-II that exhibited abnormal electrophoretic mobility. We propose that the C to A substitution in the apo C-IIPadova gene is the primary genetic defect that leads to premature termination and the synthesis of a truncated 36 amino acid apo C-II that is unable to activate lipoprotein lipase.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the physiology of cholecystokinin (CCK) in humans, we investigated the effect on gallbladder contraction and gastric emptying of a recently developed CCK receptor antagonist, MK-329. In a double-blind, four-period crossover study eight subjects received single doses of 0.5, 2, or 10 mg MK-329, or placebo, followed by an intravenous infusion of CCK-8 (30 pmol/kg.h). In placebo-treated subjects gallbladder volumes decreased on average to 43% of initial volumes after 2 h of CCK infusion. MK-329 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of CCK-stimulated gallbladder contraction with 10 mg producing complete blockade (P less than 0.01, cf. placebo). Gallbladder contraction and gastric emptying rates after a mixed meal were then measured in a two-period crossover study. Subjects received placebo or 10 mg of MK-329 2 h before eating. Gastric emptying of both solids and liquids was measured simultaneously by gamma scintigraphy. In placebo-treated subjects plasma CCK levels increased postprandially to 2.3 pM, gallbladder volumes decreased 68.4 +/- 3.8% (SE), and the times for 50% emptying of liquids and solids from the stomach were 58 +/- 10 and 128 +/- 8 min, respectively. In MK-329-treated subjects there was a marked elevation in peak CCK levels to 13.8 pM (P less than 0.01, cf. placebo), and gallbladder contraction was completely inhibited. Solid and liquid emptying rates were unaffected. These findings demonstrate that (a) MK-329 is a potent, orally active antagonist of CCK in humans, and (b) CCK is the major regulator of postprandial gallbladder contraction. These data also support the concept of negative feedback regulation of CCK secretion and suggest that mechanisms other than CCK play a dominant role in the regulation of postprandial gastric emptying rates.\r"

  ".W": "In humans, plasma fibronectin decreases early after operative injury, burn, or trauma, followed by a rapid restoration with a secondary decline typically observed if such patients become septic. We determined the rate of plasma fibronectin and plasma fibrinogen synthesis in normal subjects and injured patients using a stable isotope incorporation technique with [15N]glycine. During a constant 14-h infusion of [15N]glycine, the enrichment of [15N]glycine in both the free plasma glycine precursor pool as well as the urinary hippurate pool was determined; the latter used as an estimate of intracellular hepatic precursor enrichment. [15N]Glycine enrichment in both plasma fibronectin and fibrinogen was also quantified. The synthesis rate (Js/V) expressed in micrograms per milliliter of plasma per hour and the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) expressed as percentage of the plasma pool produced per day were determined. In normal subjects, the FSR for plasma fibronectin using 15N enrichment into urinary hippurate was 35.35 +/- 1.46%/d, whereas the Js/V was 4.45 +/- 0.19 micrograms/ml plasma per h. In normal subjects, the FSR for plasma fibronectin using 15N enrichment into free plasma glycine was 14.73 +/- 0.63%/d, whereas the Js/V was 1.98 +/- 0.09 micrograms/ml plasma per h. Early (2-3 d) after burn injury, fibronectin synthesis was increased (Js/V = 5.74 +/- 0.36; P less than 0.05), whereas later after injury, fibronectin synthesis began to decline (Js/V = 3.52 +/- 0.24; P less than 0.05) based on 15N enrichment of urinary hippurate. In contrast, the Js/V and FSR of plasma fibrinogen, a well-documented acute-phase plasma protein, revealed a sustained elevation (P less than 0.05) after injury in both the trauma and burn patients. Thus, plasma fibronectin synthesis is elevated early postinjury, which may contribute to the rapid restoration of its blood level. However, once fibronectin levels have normalized, the synthesis of plasma fibronectin appears to decline.\r"

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the corresponding gene exon and the mutation was identified by either dot blot analysis using a battery of allele-specific oligonucleotide probes or sequencing. Variants Paris and Paris 2 were identified as Arg 47 Cys mutations, and Clichy, Clichy 2, and Franconville were found to be Pro 41 Leu mutations. All five are heparin binding-site variants. ATIII Avranches is an Arg 393 His mutation and ATIII Charleville is an Ala 384 Pro mutation. These two mutations impair the reactive site of the molecule. ATIII Charleville is a new mutation of the reactive center, as predicted by previous biochemical data. The position of this new mutation, together with the other previously described mutations of the reactive center, sheds light on the molecular function of this site in inhibiting thrombin. Finally, genomic amplification by PCR is a powerful technique for the fast identification of antithrombin III mutations and their homozygous/heterozygous status, and should be useful for predicting thrombotic risk.\r"

  ".W": "We have determined the exon-intron organization and the nucleotide sequence of the exons and their flanking intronic DNA in cloned genomic DNA that encodes the first 526 amino acids of the alpha I domain of the human red cell spectrin polypeptide chain. From the gene sequence we designed oligonucleotide primers to use in the polymerase chain reaction technique to amplify the appropriate exons in DNA from individuals with three variants of hereditary elliptocytosis characterized by the presence of abnormal alpha I spectrin peptides, 46-50 and 65-68 kD in size, in partial tryptic digests of spectrin. The alpha I/68-kD abnormality resulted from a duplication of leucine codon 148 in exon 4: TTG-CTG to TTG-TTG-CTG. The alpha I/50a defect was associated in different individuals with two separate single base changes in exon 6: CTG to CCG (leucine to proline) encoding residue 254, and TCC to CCC (serine to proline) encoding residue 255. In another individual with the alpha I/50a polypeptide defect, the nucleotide sequence encoding amino acid residues 221 through 264 was normal. The alpha I/50b abnormality resulted from a single base change of CAG (glutamine) to CCG (proline) encoding residue 465 in exon 11 in two unrelated individuals. In a third individual with alpha I/50b-kD hereditary elliptocytosis, the entire exon encoding residues 445 through 490 was normal. The relationship of the alpha I domain polypeptide structure to these mutations and the organization of the gene is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) could possibly be instrumental in mediating injury to the CNS during bacterial meningitis. In CSF of rabbits with meningitis induced with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) lipooligosaccharide (LOS), TNF activity was first detected 45 min after intracisternal (IC) injection of 20 ng Hib LOS and white blood cells (WBC) first appeared 75 min later. The peak TNF activity (45 ng/ml) was observed at 120 min after IC and persisted for 5 h. When 1-2 X 10(7) CFU of Hib was used to induce meningitis, peak CSF TNF activity was comparable with that after 20 ng Hib LOS, but the activity persisted for 14 h. Dexamethasone (DXM) (1 mg/kg per i.v.) given 1 h before or simultaneously with IC Hib LOS reduced significantly TNF activity and meningeal inflammation. Goat anti-human TNF alpha antibodies given IC with 20 ng Hib LOS or 2 X 10(6) CFU of Hib resulted in a significant reduction in CSF TNF concentrations, which was also associated with reduced meningeal inflammation in Hib LOS-inoculated animals. We conclude that TNF participates in mediating meningeal inflammation associated with Hib experimental meningitis, and that DXM, when given before or with Hib LOS, inhibits CSF TNF production and modulates the meningeal inflammatory response.\r"

  ".U": "90009321\r", 
  ".W": "The reduction of myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density in congestive heart failure has been thought to be caused by agonist-induced homologous desensitization. However, recent evidence suggests that excessive adrenergic stimulation may not produce myocardial beta-receptor downregulation unless there is an additional defect in the local norepinephrine (NE) uptake mechanism. To investigate the association between beta-adrenoceptor regulation and NE uptake activity, we carried out studies in 30 dogs with right heart failure (RHF) produced by tricuspid avulsion and progressive pulmonary artery constriction and 23 sham-operated control dogs. We determined NE uptake activity by measuring accumulation of [3H]NE in tissue slices, NE uptake-1 carrier density by [3H]mazindol binding and beta-adrenoceptor density by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. Compared with sham-operated dogs, RHF dogs showed a 26% decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density, a 51% reduction in NE uptake activity, and a 57% decrease in NE uptake-1 carrier density in their right ventricles. In addition, right ventricle beta-receptor density correlated significantly with NE uptake activity and NE uptake-1 carrier density. In contrast, neither NE uptake activity nor beta-receptor density in the left ventricle and renal cortex was affected by RHF. Thus, the failing myocardium is associated with an organ- and chamber-specific subnormal neuronal NE uptake. This chamber-specific loss of NE uptake-1 carrier could effectively reduce local NE clearance, and represent a local factor that predisposes the failing ventricle to beta-adrenoceptor downregulation.\r"

Substance P also induces mast cell degranulation in vitro or in vivo. However, the extent to which substance P-induced changes in vascular permeability are mast cell-dependent is unclear. We investigated this issue by injecting substance P and certain related peptides (substance P1-4, substance P4-11) into the skin of genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/W or WCB6F1- SI/SId mice the congenic normal (+/+) mice, and W/W mice which had undergone selective local repair of their mast cell deficiency by intradermal injection of IL-3-dependent mast cells generated in vitro from the bone marrow cells of the congenic +/+ mice. Substance P induced significant augmentation of vascular permeability and significant cutaneous swelling when injected into normal mice at doses as low as 2 pmol i.d. Substance P also induced granulocyte infiltration, although the infiltrate were modest and were seen at doses of peptide from 5 to more than 20-fold higher than those required for induction of tissue swelling. The effects of substance P on tissue swelling, vascular permeability, and granulocyte infiltration were virtually entirely mast cell dependent. By contrast, substance P1-4 was inactive in our assays at 25 nmol/site, and substance P4-11 induced modest augmentation of vascular permeability, which was at least in part mast cell independent.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium ion is thought to play a role in the structure and function of pulmonary surfactant after secretion into the alveolar space. Since fetal lung liquid calcium concentration is inadequate for this hypothesized role, at a time when optimal surfactant function is necessary for survival, we speculated that the necessary calcium is secreted with the surfactant material, i.e., in the lamellar body. Lungs from rat fetuses at 20, 21, and 22 d gestation, and also from newborn rats at 3-5 h, 1 and 3 d, were rapidly frozen, sectioned, freeze-dried, and examined cold (-100 degrees C) in a transmission electron microscope equipped with a fully quantitative energy-dispersive x-ray detector and analyzer. X-ray spectra were collected from the lamellar bodies and cytoplasm of type II cells at each time point. Lamellar body calcium concentration in the fetus was approximately twice that of the adult (70 +/- 4 vs. 37 +/- 2 mmol/kg dry wt +/- SEM, P less than 0.01), and it decreased rapidly after birth to adult levels. Apically located lamellar bodies in the fetus have a significantly higher calcium concentration than those in a perinuclear position (76 +/- 4 vs. 52 +/- 3, P less than 0.01). There is significant correlation of calcium and chloride concentrations in lamellar bodies, suggesting that factors responsible for the distribution of chloride, i.e., pH, may also be responsible for the accumulation of calcium by these organelles. These results show that mature calcium transport in lamellar bodies is achieved prenatally in the rat, and suggest that the calcium required for normal surfactant function at birth is secreted with the lamellar body.\r"

All 14 subjects displayed a significant proliferative T cell response to the S/p25 envelope region encoded polypeptide; 8 also responded to preS1, while only 1 showed a significant level of T cell proliferation to preS2. Limiting dilution analysis demonstrated that the frequency of preS-specific T cells in two of these vaccine recipients was higher than that of S/p25-specific T cells. T cell cloning was then performed and a total of 29 HBV envelope antigen-reactive CD4+ cloned lines were generated from two preS-responsive vaccines. 21 of these lines were S/p25 specific, 7 preS1 specific, and 1 preS2 specific. Taken together, all these results suggest that the preS1 antigen may function as a strong T cell immunogen in man.\r"

  ".W": "To reexamine the role of albumin in cellular uptake of long chain fatty acids, we measured [3H]oleate uptake by isolated hepatocytes, adipocytes, and cardiac myocytes from incubations containing oleate/albumin complexes at molar ratios from 0.01:1 to 2:1. For each ratio the uptake was studied over a wide range of albumin concentrations. In all three cell types and at any given oleate/albumin ratio, the uptake appeared saturable with increasing concentrations of oleate:albumin complexes despite the fact that the unbound oleate concentration for each molar ratio is essentially constant. However, the \"Km\" but not the \"Vmax\" of these pseudosaturation curves was influenced by substrate availability. At low albumin concentrations, uptake velocities did not correlate with unbound oleate concentrations. However, observed and expected uptake velocities coincided at albumin concentrations approaching physiologic levels and were a saturable function of the oleate/albumin ratios and the consequent unbound oleate concentrations employed. Hence, under the experimental conditions employed in this study using a variety of suspended cell types, oleate uptake kinetics were consistent with the conventional theory at physiologic concentrations of albumin.\r"

We have examined the characteristics of the EP receptor (EP-R) on erythroid colony-forming cells (ECFC) from patients with PV. In contrast to normal ECFC, which have two classes of EP-R, with 20% showing high affinity (Kd = 0.13 nM; range, 0.04-0.20 nM) and the remainder lower affinity (Kd = 0.37 nM; range, 0.28-0.57 nM), PV ECFC show a single class of 851 low affinity EP-R with Kd = 0.72 nM (range, 0.36-0.85 nM). ECFC from patients with secondary (EP driven) polycythemia or anemia show two classes of EP-R (Kd = 0.18 and 1.10 nM, respectively). Attempts to remove tightly bound EP from putative high affinity EP-R in PV did not reveal any higher affinity receptors. Determination of molecular size by crosslinking showed two proteins of 90 and 100 kD similar to those seen with normal EP-R. These studies indicate the PV ECFC have EP-R that are structurally similar to normal EP-R but lack the higher binding affinity for EP.\r"

In this study, we screened various cytokines that could be induced by OK-432 in vivo, for their preventive effect against diabetes in NOD mice. Among recombinant mouse IFN gamma, human IL1 alpha, human IL2, mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and human TNF alpha, only human TNF alpha suppressed insulitis and significantly (P less than 0.001) inhibited development of diabetes. NOD mice were the lowest producers of the mRNA of TNF and serum TNF on stimulation with OK-432 or with IFN gamma plus LPS, compared with C57BL/6, C3H/He, and Balb/c mice. The results imply a role for low productivity of TNF in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency is characterized by insufficient amounts of alpha 1AT to protect the lower respiratory tract from neutrophil elastase, resulting in emphysema. Yeast-produced recombinant alpha 1AT (rAAT) has normal antielastase function but is associated with high renal clearance, thus obviating chronic intravenous administration. As an alternative, we evaluated aerosol administration of rAAT to alpha 1AT-deficient individuals. After aerosol administration of single doses of 10-200 mg of rAAT, epithelial lining fluid (ELF) alpha 1AT antineutrophil elastase defenses were augmented in proportion to the dose of rAAT administered. ELF alpha 1AT levels and antineutrophil elastase capacity 4 h after 200 mg rAAT aerosol were increased 40-fold over preaerosol levels, and were fivefold increased over baseline at 24 h after aerosol administration. rAAT was detectable in serum after aerosol, indicating that the lower respiratory tract epithelium may be permeable to rAAT, and that aerosolized rAAT is capable of gaining access to lung interstitium. No adverse clinical effects were noted. These observations demonstrate that aerosol administration of rAAT is safe and results in significant augmentation of lung antineutrophil elastase defenses, suggesting this method is a feasible approach to therapy. Because this approach is clinically unproven, further studies will be necessary to establish the long-term clinical efficacy of aerosol therapy in alpha 1AT deficiency.\r"

Light scrapings of intestinal mucosa and lumenal washings that contained these bodies, as evidenced by morphology and biochemical analysis, lowered surface tension in a pulsating bubble assay. Production by normal enterocytes of material with surfactant-like appearance and properties demonstrates that these structures are present in extrapulmonary epithelia, and extends the possible range of their function beyond gaseous exchange, e.g., solute exchange or lubrication on membrane surfaces.\r"

  ".W": "Acute iron intoxication is a frequent, sometimes life-threatening, form of poisoning. Present therapy, in severe cases, includes oral and intravenous administration of the potent iron chelator, deferoxamine. Unfortunately, high dose intravenous deferoxamine causes acute hypotension additive with that engendered by the iron poisoning itself. To obviate this problem, we have covalently attached deferoxamine to high molecular weight carbohydrates such as dextran and hydroxyethyl starch. These macromolecular forms of deferoxamine do not cause detectable decreases in blood pressure of experimental animals, even when administered intravenously in very large doses, and persist in circulation much longer than the free drug. These novel iron-chelating substances, but not deferoxamine itself, will prevent mortality from otherwise lethal doses of iron administered to mice either orally or intraperitoneally. Further reflecting this enhanced therapeutic efficacy, the high molecular weight iron chelators also abrogate iron-mediated hepatotoxicity, suppressing the release of alanine aminotransferase. We conclude that high molecular weight derivatives of deferoxamine hold promise for the effective therapy of acute iron intoxication and may also be useful in other clinical circumstances in which control of free, reactive iron is therapeutically desirable.\r"

  ".U": "90009375\r", 
  ".W": "The need for specialised forms of clinical audit was highlighted by the report of the Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (CEPOD). Necropsy rates in a Northern Ireland teaching hospital were studied with particular reference to perioperative deaths. To provide an overall context for these observations, the pattern of the necropsy services in Northern Ireland as a whole was also determined. For 600 consecutive deaths in a major teaching hospital, the overall necropsy rate was 180 (30%). In the 74 perioperative deaths in this group (as defined by the CEPOD) the necropsy rate was 26 (35%), compared with 16 out of 72 (22%) for other surgical deaths and 89 out of 386 (23%) for medical cases. More coroners' necropsies were carried out in the perioperative group. These figures are within the range of the CEPOD experience. In 1987, in the whole of Northern Ireland, there were 8859 hospital deaths, 520 (5.9%) hospital necropsies, and 516 (5.8%) coroners' necropsies, giving an overall necropsy rate of 11.7%. Outside the two major Belfast teaching hospitals, however, there were 6799 hospital deaths, 76.6% of all hospital deaths for Northern Ireland. In this group there were 180 (2.6%) hospital necropsies and 383 (5.6%) coroners' cases, the overall necropsy rate being only 8.2%. These wide variations reflect the fact that the number of pathologists in post in the peripheral areas of the province falls substantially short of levels recommended by the Royal College of Pathologists. If clinical audit along CEPOD lines is to be effective nationally, more emphasis should be placed on the value of necropsy and local deficiencies in provision will have to be identified and remedied. It is suggested that this could be achieved by combining audit provisions with budgetary incentives.\r"

Defects in surgery were uncommon but permitted modification in surgical technique to avoid recurrence. Myocardial necrosis and pulmonary foreign body embolism were common findings, the importance of which is uncertain and requires further study for their prevention. Even in the most thoroughly investigated cases postmortem examination has a high yield of clinically important pathology which is undetected during life.\r"

Active chronic gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori was found in three patients with portal hypertension compared with 13 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. The changes of reflux gastritis were seen in nine patients with portal hypertension compared with three patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. Mucosal capillary dilatation, assessed on sections stained for factor VIII related antigen, a specific marker for endothelial cells, was significantly greater in biopsy specimens from patients with portal hypertension but this difference was not apparent on sections stained conventionally. The degree of capillary dilatation was unrelated to the presence of histological gastritis. These observations support the view that portal hypertension is associated with a distinctive gastropathy characterised by prominence and dilatation of mucosal capillaries.\r"

All epithelial areas showing vaginal metaplasia exhibited staining confined to the nucleus in the basal and parabasal layers of the squamous epithelium while no staining was encountered in adjacent trigonal transitional epithelium included in nine of the biopsy specimens. The selective expression of nuclear oestrogen receptor in trigonal epithelium affected by vaginal metaplasia in a distribution similar to that reported in vaginal epithelium by other workers lends further support to oestrogen mediated aetiology in this condition and is consistent with an embryological derivation of the trigone, distinct from that of the rest of the bladder.\r"

The expression of laminin showed that benign glandular structures were surrounded by a mainly intact basement membrane. In sclerosing cholangiocarcinomas laminin was irregularly distributed, and in large areas totally absent. The findings suggest that deposition of basement membrane material is defective. Sclerosing cholangitis may be extremely difficult to distinguish from well differentiated sclerosing cholangiocarcinoma. This sample was small, but the diseases studied were relatively rare. Staining for laminin might be of additional use to surgical pathologists in the differential diagnosis of benign sclerosing lesions and sclerosing cholangiocarcinomas.\r"

In three cases there was calcification within the media and adventitia of the umbilical arteries, with extension into Wharton's jelly in one case. The pathogenesis of this pattern of calcification--the sclerotic variant--is unclear but the findings of inflammation in the umbilical cord and its vessels, membranes, and decidua suggest intrauterine infection. In two cases there was complete calcification of umbilical arterial lumina resulting in total obliteration. The findings of fetal vessels in the chorionic plate with medial calcification in one of these two cases raises the possibility of thrombosis within the umbilical cord vessels as a cause, but the latter was not found. One infant from each group was liveborn. Both had shown signs of fetal distress in utero and delivered prematurely. The other three pregnancies resulted in macerated stillbirth preterm.\r"

There was strong specific staining in the renal tubular cells in nine (18%) cases. A similar pattern of staining was seen in three of a series of 50 kidneys selected for comparison from a wide range of necropsy cases. The staining was finely granular within the cytoplasm of proximal convoluted tubular cells and diffuse in tubular cell nuclei. In an attempt to validate the staining pattern the immunoperoxidase technique was also performed on formalin fixed kidneys from rats which had been given intravenous injections of crude bacterial products containing TSST-1. These showed coarse granular cytoplasmic staining in proximal convoluted tubules with some diffuse nuclear staining. This pattern was not seen in controls injected with saline. These results indicate that TSST-1 might have a pathogenic role in some cases of SIDS.\r"

The unusual distribution of the lesions and the young age of the patients suggested a possible association with immunisation. The clinical and histopathological features in these cases were accordingly reviewed. The biopsy specimens showed the usual histological appearances of a prominent inflammatory component, fibrosis, and vascular proliferation associated with aggregates of eosinophils. The features were those of a reactive rather than neoplastic process. Immunohistochemical preparations showed positive staining of variable numbers of plasma cells with antibodies to IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE and a reticular staining of germinal centres with IgM and IgE antibodies. Immunisation histories obtained from the patients' general practitioners showed a remarkable correlation between the distribution of the lesions and the sites of injections and an aetiological role for immunisation in these cases seems likely.\r"

The present study was performed to compare these three reagents in terms of their immunocytochemical reactions and target molecule(s). On Western blotting of white cell extracts the three antibodies reacted with antigens of the same molecular weight (range 110-160 kilodaltons). Furthermore, their immunocytochemical reactivity with normal human cells, as analysed by two-colour flow cytometry, was essentially identical (labelling of monocytes, most T lymphocytes, and weak reactions with some B cells), and the antibodies gave closely similar reactions on 54 white cell derived neoplasms. To identify the target antigen for these three reagents, antibodies from the Third International Workshop on Leucocyte Antigens were reviewed and it was shown that the Western blotting and immunocytochemical reactions of MT1, L60 (Leu-22), and DF-T1 were identical with those of the reagents which defined the CD43 antigen (also known as leucosialin or sialophorin). Furthermore, all these antibodies reacted with cells transfected with a cDNA clone encoding CD43. It is concluded that antibodies MT1, L60 (Leu-22), and DF-T1 all recognise the heavily glycosylated myeloid/lymphoid associated CD43 antigen.\r"

Eleven patients (10 men, one woman) corresponded histologically to intermediate (INT) or mantle zone lymphoma, and five, with less well defined features, were designated small lymphocytic lymphoma with cleaved cells. The blood films showed a pleomorphic picture with lymphoid cells of predominantly medium size with nuclear irregularities and clefts. The membrane phenotype of the circulating cells showed strong immunoglobulin staining and reactivity with CD5 and FMC7 in all cases tested; CD10 was positive in six out of nine cases. The membrane phenotype of two of the five cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma was close to those of B-CLL and three resembled INT lymphoma. Bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens showed a diffuse pattern of infiltration in INT lymphoma. The median survival of these patients was less than two years, suggesting that a leukaemic presentation is associated with poor prognosis. By combining data from histology, membrane markers, and peripheral blood morphology, the leukaemic phase of typical INT lymphoma can be defined in most cases.\r"

This was done to determine whether haem inhibitors depress alpha globin chain synthesis. The progressive increase of INH concentration (10-40 mmol l-1) in reticulocytes from a beta thalassaemia heterozygote resulted in a remarkable decrease of the alpha and beta chain synthesis, ranging from 80% to 97% and from 74% to 96% of control values, respectively, and in a gradual drop of alpha:beta ratio from 1.87 to 1.38. Furthermore, in the samples incubated with 40 mmol l-1 INH, a pronounced inhibition of globin chain synthesis 77 (19%) for alpha chain and 67 (27%) for beta or beta S chain) and a substantial drop of the alpha:beta or beta S ratio in samples with INH (median 1.16) compared with that in samples without INH (median 1.70) were observed. The inhibitory effect of INH was significantly or completely corrected by adding exogenous haem. It is suggested that haem inhibition and the resulting preferential diminution of alpha chain synthesis could provide a new approach to the treatment of homozygous beta thalassaemia with an excess of detrimental free alpha chain in erythroid cells.\r"

It requires the use of biotinylated Campylobacter pylori DNA as the probe to detect C pylori DNA in routinely embedded stomach biopsy specimens. In sequential tissue samples from a 58 year old woman with recurrent chronic active gastritis the C pylori probe hybridised with bacteria whenever they were histologically visible. When no bacteria were visible histologically, hybridisation was negative with one exception. In a single biopsy specimen without visible C pylori, hybridisation occurred with the surface of the antrum epithelium, while control hybridisation with a heterologous probe remained negative. From a parallel biopsy specimen taken at the same time the C pylori culture was positive. It is concluded that DISH, although more laborious than routine staining techniques, may be more sensitive in that it detects bacteria very easily, even when sections are not counterstained or when they are present in low numbers, and that bacteria which do hybridise are unequivocally identified as C pylori and not Campylobacter-like organisms.\r"

Because of the potential benefits of very long periods of inflation, 21 anesthetized thoracotomized dogs were randomized to left circumflex coronary artery occlusion with either a standard or an autoperfusion balloon catheter for 90 min. Nine dogs sustained ventricular fibrillation before completing the study, eight after standard balloon inflation and one after autoperfusion balloon inflation (p = 0.04). ST segment elevation was 0.45 +/- 0.13 mV after 15 min of standard balloon inflation versus -0.03 +/- 0.03 mV after autoperfusion balloon inflation (p less than 0.001). Regional myocardial blood flow was 0.02 +/- 0.01 ml/min per g after 30 min of standard balloon inflation compared with 0.78 +/- 0.23 ml/min per g in the group subjected to autoperfusion balloon inflation (p = 0.01). The area of necrosis/area at risk in the standard catheter group was 40.4 +/- 19.3% versus 1.2 +/- 1.2% for the autoperfusion catheter group (p = 0.01). Thus, the autoperfusion catheter preserves blood flow and limits myocardial ischemia and necrosis despite 90 min of balloon inflation.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have provided evidence for an important contribution of the transient outward current to the electrical activity of canine ventricular epicardium, but not endocardium. The present study examines the characteristics of action potential duration and refractoriness in these two tissue types. The time and rate dependence of changes in action potential duration and refractoriness observed in epicardium were significantly more accentuated than in endocardium. The restitution of action potential duration in epicardium paralleled the restitution of phase 1 amplitude of the action potential in this tissue. The correlation between phase 1 amplitude and action potential duration recorded from a large number of epicardial and endocardial preparations was significant under both steady state and restitution conditions. 4-Aminopyridine, a transient outward current blocker, decreased the time dependence of phase 1 amplitude and concomitantly decreased the time dependence of action potential duration in epicardium. 4-Aminopyridine abbreviated the action potential duration of epicardium at slow stimulation rates but had little effect or prolonged it at fast rates or after premature stimulation. (The availability of a transient outward current is relatively small after premature stimulation.) The data support the hypothesis that the prominent presence of a transient outward current in epicardium, but not endocardium, contributes to the differences in the time and rate dependence of action potential duration and refractoriness in the two tissue types. The results also demonstrate the effect of an outward current to prolong the action potential and the effect of an outward current blocker to abbreviate the action potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether flow-limiting residual stenosis typical of that seen in patients affects plasma isoform profiles, stenosis sufficient to preclude reactive hyperemia was induced in dogs before coronary occlusion, followed by recanalization in 2 h. Plasma activities of the MM CK isoform released from myocardium (MM3) and its two conversion products elaborated sequentially (MM2 and MM1) were assayed in serial samples with a rapid quantitative chromatofocusing procedure. Reperfusion in 10 dogs shortened the mean intervals (+/-SD) to the occurrence of peak MM3 activity (3.7 +/- 0.9 h), peak MM3 expressed as a percent of total CK activity (MM3%, 2.5 +/- 0.3 h) and the maximal ratio of MM3 to MM1 (2.7 +/- 0.3 h) compared with results in 10 control dogs without reperfusion. Nevertheless, the appearance of these peaks was delayed by 8% to 57% when residual stenosis was present. In contrast, the rate of increase of MM3% was delineated before the peak, was fivefold greater with recanalization (1.19 +/- 0.46 versus 0.26 +/- 0.11% min-1 in control dogs) and was not attenuated by residual stenosis. Thus, this criterion appears capable of delineating recanalization early after thrombolysis whether or not high grade residual stenosis is present.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to compare pericardiocentesis guided by a pacing current applied through the pericardiocentesis needle with the traditional method of monitoring ST segment elevation from the needle tip electrogram. ST segment elevation was measured at 3 mm from the epicardium, after epicardial contact, after epicardial penetration and again at 3 mm from the epicardium after epicardial penetration. Two millivolts of ST segment elevation gave the highest combined positive (86%) and negative (79%) predictive value for epicardial contact by the pericardiocentesis needle between the two groups with the largest difference: 3 mm from the epicardium before contact and after epicardial penetration. Therefore, ST segment monitoring cannot reliably determine the point of epicardial contact. To determine the optimal stimulus strength for pulse generator-guided pericardiocentesis, pacing studies were performed using 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mA unipolar stimulus strengths. The pacing studies were performed both with and without a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion to determine if increased pericardial pressure altered the pacing threshold. A 4 mA unipolar cathodal stimulus was chosen because it captured the ventricle only with direct contact of the epicardium. Ten dogs were instrumented and cardiac tamponade produced so that a subxiphoid approach to the epicardium with the pacing needle electrode could be attempted. During pericardiocentesis, needle tip electrograms were recorded, alternating with pacing attempts using a 4 mA unipolar stimulus. In all 10 dogs, the effusion was entered and epicardium was contacted as indicated by capture. No myocardial perforation or coronary artery or venous injuries were produced. These findings support the use of a pulse generator to guide pericardiocentesis.\r"

These patients were classified into three groups: Group 1 = patients with no exercise ST deviation (n = 856), Group 2 = patients with painless exercise ST deviation (n = 242) and Group 3 = patients with both angina and ST segment deviation during exercise (n = 600). Patients with exercise angina had a history of a longer and more aggressive anginal course (with a greater frequency of angina, with nocturnal episodes and/or progressive symptom pattern) and more severe coronary artery disease (almost two-thirds had three vessel disease). The 5 year survival rate among the patients with painless ST deviation was similar to that of patients without ST deviation (86% and 88%, respectively) and was significantly better than that of patients with both symptoms and ST deviation (5 year survival rate 73% in patients with exercise-limiting angina). Similar trends were obtained in subgroups defined by the amount of coronary artery disease present. In the total study group of 1,698 patients, silent ischemia on the treadmill was not a benign finding (average annual mortality rate 2.8%) but, compared with symptomatic ischemia, did indicate a subgroup of patients with coronary artery disease who had a less aggressive anginal course, less coronary artery disease and a better prognosis. Thus, silent ischemia during exercise testing in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease represents an intermediate risk response in the spectrum of exercise-induced ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the amount of myocardium jeopardized during silent ischemia and painful ischemia, 112 consecutive patients undergoing coronary arteriography with ischemia demonstrated by exercise and redistribution tomographic thallium-201 myocardial imaging (SPECT) were divided into two groups: 84 patients without anginal pain (silent ischemia) and 28 with pain (painful ischemia). The SPECT apical, mid and basal ventricular levels of the short-axis view and the apical portion of the long-axis view were divided into 20 segments. The results were 1) 7.4 +/- 4.7 ischemic segments in silent ischemia and 7.6 +/- 3.7 in painful ischemia (p = NS) with 4.7 +/- 3.6 segments in silent ischemia undergoing total redistribution compared with 5.4 +/- 3.4 in painful ischemia (p = NS); 2) no difference in the incidence of single, double or triple vessel disease between silent and painful ischemic groups; 3) similar anatomic distribution of ischemic segments between the two groups; 4) more positive exercise electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in painful ischemia (70%) than in silent ischemia (32%) (p less than 0.001) with equal amounts of ischemia associated with positive and negative exercise ECG findings. Conclusions: 1) Patients with silent and painful ischemia during exercise have similar amounts of ischemic myocardium demonstrated by tomographic thallium-201 imaging and similar extent of angiographically documented coronary artery disease despite the absence of pain and the lower incidence of positive exercise ECG findings in silent ischemia. 2) Positive and negative exercise ECG findings were associated with similar amounts of ischemic myocardium.\r"

In 87 patients, optimal quality two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were obtained and were repeated at daily intervals to detect mural thrombus formation. The site of infarction was anterior in 53 patients and inferior in 34. On admission, all patients received subcutaneous heparin and antiplatelet agents (aspirin, dipyridamole); none received full anticoagulant therapy. Left ventricular mural thrombus was visualized between 2 and 11 days (median 6) after the clinical onset of infarction in 21 (40%) of the 53 patients with anterior infarction. No patients with inferior infarction had echocardiographic evidence of thrombus formation. During follow-up of 22 to 51 months (mean 39), none of the 21 patients with mural thrombus had clinical evidence of systemic embolism. One patient with inferior and one with anterior infarction had a cerebral embolus 7 days and 9 months, respectively, after the acute event, but neither of these patients had echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular thrombus at any stage. Echocardiography performed at 1 and 2 years of follow-up showed persistent evidence of thrombus in only 8 (31%) and 5 (24%) of the 21 patients, respectively.

Biopsy sensitivity was determined in 14 hearts with histologically proved myocarditis studied ex vivo, including 12 autopsy hearts and 2 native hearts explanted at cardiac transplantation. With use of the Stanford and Cordis bioptomes, endoymocardial biopsy was performed near the apex on the right side of the ventricular septum (four to five samples/bioptome per patient) and repeated in the nonapical portion of the septum from the moderator band to the subpulmonary infundibulum (additional three to five samples/bioptome per patient). In a casewise assessment, 43% to 57% of the endomyocardial samples were diagnostic for myocarditis, as calculated separately for each bioptome in each region of sampling (apical/nonapical). Both apical and nonapical sensitivity improved to 64% when the findings of the two bioptomes were combined (eight to nine samples/patient in each region). By collectively analyzing all available samples for each patient, 11 (79%) of 14 cases could be diagnosed, but this required a mean of 17.2 samples/patient, a number clinically unrealistic. The exclusion of four cases of fungal myocarditis from analysis did not significantly alter the results. In transmural ventricular sections, none of four patients with sudden death had inflammatory disease confined to the conduction system. In conclusion, despite six to eight negative biopsy samples/patient with suspected myocarditis, repeat biopsy may still be warranted.\r"

A high degree of interobserver agreement was found in evaluation of both ejection fraction measurements and wall motion abnormalities. Readings for ejection fraction immediately after exercise taken on different days could be estimated within 4% of the values measured in the first test; similarly measured wall motion score index was within 6% of that in the first test. Ejection fractions and wall motion scores were highly correlated between tests 1 and 2. The correlation coefficients between tests 1 and 2 were 0.92 for both the pre- and postexercise ejection fractions and 0.98 for both the pre- and postexercise wall motion scores. Quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography immediately after exercise is highly reproducible, providing a valuable tool for assessing serial changes in left ventricular function.\r"

No data exist, however, regarding the influence of heart rate on Doppler measurements of aortic blood flow velocity and acceleration in humans. Thus, 12 normal volunteers underwent continuous wave Doppler ultrasound recording from the suprasternal notch at baseline and during progressive transesophageal atrial pacing at intervals of 10 beats/min between 90 and 140 beats/min while 100% atrial capture and 1:1 atrioventricular conduction were maintained. Subjects were studied both upright (n = 12) and supine (n = 10). With the subject upright at baseline (mean heart rate 77.8 +/- 10.6 beats/min), peak acceleration averaged to 16.8 +/- 3.4 m/s2, and peak modal velocity and flow velocity integral averaged 0.72 +/- 0.14 m/s and 8.4 +/- 2.1 cm, respectively. With pacing at 90 beats/min, peak acceleration decreased to 15.6 +/- 3.6 m/s2, a significant decline from baseline values (p less than 0.005). Similar declines were seen during pacing at 90 beats/min for peak modal velocity and flow velocity integral (0.64 +/- 0.16 m/s and 7.1 +/- 1.9 cm, respectively; both p less than 0.005 versus baseline values). At the peak pacing rate of 140 beats/min, average peak acceleration decreased to 12.8 +/- 3.1 m/s2, and peak modal velocity and flow velocity integral decreased to 0.52 +/- 0.11 m/s and 5.02 +/- 1.25 cm, respectively.

  ".W": "Doppler color flow mapping offers the potential to assess serial changes in mitral regurgitation associated with therapeutic interventions such as surgical valve repair or after-load reduction. However, the day to day variability of color flow jets in mitral regurgitation must be established to distinguish therapeutic responses from random variation. Therefore, 14 patients with mitral regurgitation were each studied on 5 sequential days by color flow velocity mapping. Instrument settings were kept constant for each patient, and no patient had a significant change in heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension or circumferential wall stress between studies. To assess day to day variability, the area of the Doppler color flow map was carefully measured in multiple views by an experienced echocardiographer. Mitral regurgitant jet area by color flow mapping tended to be greater from apical rather than parasternal views (5.6 +/- 4.0 versus 2.9 +/- 2.1 cm2, respectively, p less than 0.03). The maximal jet area in any view ranged from 0.4 to 15.0 cm2 in individual subjects. Variability of maximal jet area within subjects was not statistically significant by repeated measures analysis of variance (F = 1.88, p = 0.13); however, the coefficient of variation was approximately 15%. Thus, a reduction in jet area of greater than or equal to 30% would be needed to predict a therapeutic response at the 95% confidence level. These data have important implications regarding the use of color flow mapping to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in mitral regurgitation.\r"

The present study was designed to determine whether factor VII elevation is present at a younger age and whether zymogen or activated factor VII is responsible for this elevation. A group of 20 asymptomatic first degree relatives (mean age 34.9 years) of patients with premature ischemic heart disease were compared with 15 age-matched normal subjects at low risk of ischemic heart disease and 15 older subjects with established ischemic heart disease (mean age 49.7 years). Factor VII procoagulant, coupled amidolytic and antigenic assays, as well as fasting serum triglyceride and cholesterol assays, were performed on all three groups. Factor VII antigen and coagulant activity was significantly elevated in first degree relatives, as was factor VII antigen in the patients with ischemic heart disease. The increased factor VII level in these subjects was caused by elevated factor VII zymogen, not activated factor VII. The results of this study, combined with those of previous studies, suggest that factor VII may be a useful additional marker of the risk for ischemic heart disease and merits further investigation.\r"

This study evaluates two-dimensional echocardiography as a method of assessing coronary artery distribution in tetralogy of Fallot. Forty-five consecutive patients with tetralogy of Fallot, aged 0.1 to 20.5 years (mean 5.7 +/- 4.3), had prospective two-dimensional echocardiographic studies to examine the branching patterns of the coronary arteries and to determine the presence or absence of a branch from the right or left coronary artery that crossed the right ventricular outflow tract.

Twenty-two studies were completed before coronary angiography (group A) and 23 after angiography (group B). All eight patients (18%) with coronary abnormalities were correctly identified by two-dimensional echocardiography (five in group A and three in group B). Three had bilateral anterior descending coronary arteries originating from the left and right coronary arteries, two had the anterior descending artery originating from the right coronary artery, two had a large conal branch from the right coronary artery and one had origin of both left and right coronary arteries from a single left ostium.

All patients underwent cardiac catheterization, and seven patients had surgical closure of the fistula. The origin, course and site of drainage of the coronary artery fistula were correctly identified prospectively by echocardiographic examination in all patients. Color flow imaging was particularly helpful in visualizing the site of drainage of the fistula. Diameters of the right and left coronary arteries at their origin and of the aortic root were measured from two-dimensional echocardiographic frames and compared with measurements obtained in normal children. The ratio of coronary artery diameter to aortic root diameter in normal children was 0.14 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD) for the right coronary artery and 0.17 +/- 0.03 for the left coronary artery. These normal ratios were greatly exceeded for coronary arteries feeding the fistula, and ranged from 0.68 to 0.84 for the right coronary artery and from 0.34 to 0.52 for the left coronary artery. All anatomic information needed for surgical treatment of coronary artery fistula was consistently obtained by echocardiography with color flow imaging. The fistula was closed from within the heart in five patients and by ligation from the epicardial surface in two patients. In these latter patients, intraoperative color flow imaging at the time of ligation proved to be extremely valuable in achieving complete closure.\r"

Subjects were referred to this study because of casual office blood pressure measurements of greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg; all were less than 50 years old, had no other cardiovascular or systemic disease and had not received antihypertensive medication for at least 1 year. To precisely determine blood pressure, measurements were made over 30 min with the patient in the supine position and during awake hours with ambulatory monitoring. Left ventricular mass was determined echocardiographically, and Doppler echocardiography was used to assess left ventricular filling. No subject had increased left ventricular mass, but 8 (22%) of the 37 had abnormal left ventricular filling. All eight subjects with abnormal left ventricular filling had an ambulatory systolic blood pressure greater than 130 mm Hg and a supine systolic blood pressure greater than 122 mm Hg. Abnormal filling was not related to left ventricular mass or heart rate. In multivariate analysis, the degree of abnormal filling could best be predicted from a combination of age and supine systolic blood pressure (r = 0.69; p less than 0.001). This study suggests that in untreated early essential hypertension, abnormal left ventricular filling is present in greater than 20% of subjects, precedes detectable left ventricular hypertrophy and is related to age and prevailing level of blood pressure.\r"

Five patients with acute severe mitral regurgitation secondary to ischemic posterior papillary muscle dysfunction underwent emergent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Two patients were in cardiogenic shock and required intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. Angioplasty resulted in rapid improvement in hemodynamic variables, and all patients were discharged at a mean of 10 days after the procedure. Long-term follow-up study (mean 35 +/- 6 months) revealed normal mitral valve function angiographically and by Doppler echocardiography in four patients. Repeat angioplasty was required in one patient, and another underwent coronary artery bypass surgery without valve replacement for restenosis. One patient developed progressive mitral regurgitation and required elective mitral valve replacement 12 months after angioplasty. These preliminary findings suggest that emergent coronary angioplasty is a useful therapeutic intervention in the treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation and is associated with a favorable long-term outcome.\r"

In this prospective study, 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was used to assess the frequency of atrial and ventricular premature beats in 25 patients with hypothyroidism (5 men and 20 women, aged 56 +/- 3 years) before and 3.5 +/- 0.5 months (mean +/- SEM) after thyroid replacement therapy. Plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone was 73.6 +/- 12.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.6 microU/ml and free thyroxine index was 2.4 +/- 0.4 and 9.8 +/- 0.9 micrograms/100 ml at baseline and after thyroid replacement therapy, respectively. The frequency of ventricular premature beats was not affected by thyroid replacement therapy (from 273 +/- 221 at baseline to 352 +/- 235 beats/24 h after therapy), even in patients with frequent baseline arrhythmias. In contrast, the frequency of atrial premature beats was slightly increased after thyroid replacement therapy (from 47 +/- 17 to 279 +/- 197 beats/24 h), largely as a result of changes seen in three patients. No patient developed new onset of sustained ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias. Average, basal and maximal heart rates during ECG monitoring increased significantly after thyroid replacement therapy (average 72 +/- 2 to 80 +/- 2; basal 64 +/- 2 to 70 +/- 2; maximal 114 +/- 3 to 130 +/- 3 beats/min, respectively, p less than 0.001). In conclusion, thyroid replacement therapy is safe in patients with common benign cardiac arrhythmias, and does not trigger an increase in arrhythmia frequency except in rare patients with baseline atrial premature beats. It is, however, associated with an increase in basal, average and maximal heart rates.\r"

  ".W": "Although an abnormality in airway smooth muscle has been promoted as a mechanism for airway hyperresponsiveness, there is, so far, little evidence to support this. We investigated whether in vitro hyperresponsiveness to pharmacologic agents could be induced in human airway tissue by passive sensitization and whether these changes in contractile responses were related to an alteration in calcium mobilization. Human bronchial tissue was incubated in serum with a high RAST titer to Dermatophagoides farinae. Control tissues were incubated in serum taken from a skin test-negative donor with a total IgE of less than 10 IU/ml. We compared contractile responses to histamine, KCI, and carbachol in nonsensitized and sensitized tissues and examined the effect on these responses of the calcium voltage-dependent channel agonist, BAY K8644 (10(-6) mol/L). We found that sensitization significantly increased responses to histamine, depressed responses to carbachol, and increased the involvement of the calcium voltage-dependent channel in contractions to KCl. These results suggest that airway hyperresponsiveness may be associated with altered calcium mobilization in airway smooth muscle.\r"

This finding may depend on the region where the source materials were harvested and which source materials were used for the preparation of the extracts. Furthermore, by high-performance liquid chromatography in the low-molecular-weight range, two distinct peaks could be detected in the nondiafiltered IRP, which were detected in the diafiltered RE and PE as traces only.

During daily dosing with cetirizine, 5 mg or 10 mg at bedtime for 35 days, serum cetirizine concentrations and suppression of histamine-induced wheals and flares were monitored every 7 days, 12 hours after the cetirizine dose. The mean serum cetirizine concentrations remained relatively stable during this time, and the mean wheal-and-flare areas remained significantly suppressed (p less than 0.01) compared to baseline wheal-and-flare areas measured before the first dose of cetirizine. The symptoms and signs of allergic rhinitis were suppressed throughout the study by cetirizine, 5 mg and 10 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the Kolmogorov-Smirnov difference test, the cumulative frequency of reaction diameters and loge-transformed diameters of all reactions and reactions to individual allergenic extracts differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) from a normal distribution. The ability to identify specific differences between reactions to closely related pollen extracts was evaluated. Specific reactions could be reliably identified with greater than or equal to 10 mm diameter flares. This arbitrary conservative threshold was used to estimate the relative prevalence of positive reactions to each allergenic extract. Seven allergenic extracts elicited the first quartile of all positive reactions. Thirteen, 18, and 30 allergenic extracts, respectively, were needed to elicit the second, third, and fourth quartiles of all positive reactions. Reactions to amphiphilous, as well as anemophilous, pollens were detected. Skin test reactions to grasses were more prevalent than reactions to weeds and trees. The most informative allergenic extracts for the detection of patients who exhibited a positive reaction to any extract were from red fescue-grass pollens, mesquite, short ragweed, red clover, and timothy-grass pollens.\r"

Patients with chronic urticaria and/or perennial rhinitis negative for secondary pathology or other allergies were subjected to a strict diagnostic protocol for food allergy. Briefly, out of a case list of 207 patients, we found 23 patients whose symptoms were clearly related, on open reintroduction, to at least one food. The really offending foods in these patients were subsequently identified by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. Only 10 of the 23 patients had positive challenges for 13 foods. Double-blind challenges were repeated after 1 year or more of avoidance of the offending foods to evaluate the persistence or disappearance of sensitivity. We found that five (38%) of the 13 previously offending foods were well tolerated. Thus, in adults, as previously proved in children, dietary avoidance of the offending foods appears to be an effective measure for dealing with food allergy. The kind of foods involved and the completeness of their avoidance appeared to be important factors favoring the reestablishment of tolerance in adults.\r"

Although the cluster represented a statistically significant increase in the number of asthma deaths in this age group over that observed in previous years, no common exposure to environmental, infectious, or therapeutic agents could be identified. The patterns of hospital admissions for asthma and emergency room visits at the two pediatric hospitals in the community did not suggest an increase in the frequency or severity of asthma during this time. Despite the lack of evidence for common exposure, the decedents shared many personal and medical characteristics. All decedents were black patients and were of lower socioeconomic status. All were adolescents and were responsible for regulating their own medication schedules. Lack of appreciation of the severity of their asthma by medical personnel and the patients' families was evident. For example, two patients with severe asthma had not been prescribed inhaled corticosteroids. In addition, the four decedents tested had markedly subtherapeutic or zero serum theophylline levels measured at the time of the fatal episode, even though appropriate amounts of theophylline had been prescribed. Their theophylline levels were substantially lower than levels in patients of the same age observed at the emergency room or hospitalized for asthma during the same time period. Continued efforts to educate adolescent patients, their families, and medical care providers about the treatment of asthma are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "To understand better the response of patients with allergic rhinitis to nasal challenge with antigen, we studied the mechanism of priming, that is, the increased clinical response to daily sequential nasal challenges. Ten subjects with ragweed hay fever were challenged four times with increasing doses of ragweed pollen. The first 2 challenge days were separated by 2 weeks, whereas the last three challenges occurred on sequential days. Nasal lavages, performed before and after each nasal challenge, were evaluated for levels of inflammatory mediators and cellular content. In contrast to control days, a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the number of sneezes occurred on both priming days. Priming was associated with a significant increase in the level of histamine on both priming days, whereas the second priming day was also associated with an increase in TAME-esterase activity, kinins, and prostaglandin D2 obtained after challenge (p less than 0.05 for all). In the lavages before challenge on the priming days, the total number of cells and the number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and alcian blue-positive cells were significantly increased, but in contrast, basal levels of mediators were not. The net increase in the number of alcian blue-positive cells correlated with the net increase in the amount of histamine released on the priming days (r = 0.661; p less than 0.05). These studies suggest that priming results, in part, from increased mediator release from influxing inflammatory cells.\r"

The sera of 62/65 workers referred for specific inhalation challenges with isocyanates were analyzed for the presence of specific antibodies to the relevant isocyanate. Most workers (39, 63%) were exposed to HDI, some to MDI (17, 27%), and a few to toluene diisocyanate (six, 10%). Specific inhalation challenges were positive in 29 subjects, eliciting either immediate (seven), early late (two), late (13), or dual (seven) reactions. Specific inhalation challenges were more often positive in those subjects with increased nonspecific bronchial responsiveness. Twenty-nine subjects demonstrated increased levels of specific IgE and/or IgG antibodies to isocyanates in the absence of antibodies against human serum albumin (increased IgE only, no subject; IgG only, 20; both IgE and IgG, nine subjects). Although there was a loose association between the results of specific inhalation challenges and levels of specific IgE, the association was much better with the level of specific IgG. Indeed, 21 of the 29 subjects (72%) with positive challenges had increased levels of specific IgG, whereas 25 of the 33 subjects (76%) with negative challenges had normal levels of antibodies. The association was significant with both HDI and MDI. The levels of antibodies were not significantly associated with the type of temporal reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The technique was to determine whether these levels could be useful as a monitor of exposure. Both symptomatic (with and without specific IgE) and nonsymptomatic individuals were studied. Several antigenic source materials were investigated for each animal. The IgG response was extremely complex and elicited a varied pattern of response between animals (mouse, rat, and rabbit). No evidence was found for raised IgG levels being directly related to the degree of exposure, more to the presence of clinical symptoms and specific IgE. Long-term heavy exposure to rats in nonsymptomatic individuals appeared to produce a suppression of the IgG response in relation to control levels. These findings suggest that IgG is not an indicator of exposure but demonstrate a varied response related to the presence of specific allergy to an animal, the particle size on which antigens are carried, and the physiologic state of the mucosa onto which the particles impact.\r"

Three different lots were tested for each of the IVIG formulations, and the IgG subclass assays were performed by three different laboratories. Differences were found among the three formulations in subclass concentration and aggregate content. Sandoglobulin (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, N.J.) contained a significantly higher amount of IgG2 (p less than 0.002) compared to the other formulations. All the formulations tested were found to be deficient in IgG4 relative to the World Health Organization standards, with Gammagard (Hyland Therapeutics, Glendale, Calif.) demonstrating only negligible amounts. Immunoglobulin aggregate content was different among manufacturers with Gamimmune N (Cutter Biological, Berkeley, Calif.) containing the highest amount of monomer IgG (99.8%). Significant differences were found in the subclass results obtained by the ICN ImmunoBiologicals assay (Lisle, Ill.), compared to the two reference laboratories. This difference among the subclass assays raises the question as to the use of these assays in the evaluation of patients with suspected subclass deficiencies. The differences in subclass concentration and aggregate content in IVIG preparations were great, and future clinical trials with these formulations would be indicated to determine the clinical significance of these findings.\r"

It is also evident that intravenous immune globulin is effective in patients with a variety of automimmune disorders. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of intravenous immune globulin replacement therapy in patients with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia. We measured pokeweed mitogen-induced immunoglobulin synthesis of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells cocultured in equal numbers with normal subjects' lymphocytes to assess suppressor cell activity. The mean suppressor cell activity in coculture experiments at baseline of nine patients in the study was -16%. Suppressor activity was demonstrated in two of nine patients at baseline who received intravenous immune globulin therapy before initiation of the study. After intravenous immune globulin therapy at a low dose (100 to 200 mg/kg/mo), suppressor cell activity was demonstrated in all nine patients, which ranged from -63% to -100%. In five patients intravenous immune globulin therapy was discontinued for 4 months. There was a return to baseline levels, with suppressor activity ranging from -20% to -50%. On reinstitution of high-dose intravenous immune globulin therapy (300 to 400 mg/kg/mo), all patients except one again demonstrated increased suppressor cell activity. Cell separation and recombination cell culture experiments were performed. All patients had an intrinsic B cell defect before the initiation of therapy so that the effects of intravenous immune globulin therapy on B cell function could not be assessed. Combining normal B cells with the patient's T cell-enriched fraction showed marked suppression of pokeweed mitogen-induced immune globulin synthesis. This suppression was reversible by irradiation of the T cell fraction. Removal of CD8-positive T cells by cell sorting resulted in normal immunoglobulin synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent seizures are a significant cause of childhood morbidity. Often the underlying pathogenesis is unknown. Studies from several laboratories have suggested a relationship between perturbations of humoral immunity and clinical epilepsy. Brain-specific antigens have been observed in the systemic circulation after brain injury. This can be followed by the appearance of antibodies to neuronal tissues in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, there appears to be disproportionate representation of persons with coexisting humoral immune deficiencies among patients with chronic epilepsy. Interestingly, a potent immunosuppressant, adrenocorticotropic hormone, has long been the principal treatment for infantile spasms. Given this body of information associating humoral immunity with recurrent seizures, several investigators have recently attempted to treat intractable childhood epilepsy with high-dose intravenous immune globulin. Although the number of patients treated is small and it is not possible to make comparisons between individual studies, nevertheless the results have been encouraging. Five patients with intractable seizures who failed to respond to conventional therapy were treated with an outpatient regimen of intravenous immune globulin (1 gm/kg/day) for 2 days. Two patients showed significant clinical improvement while a third had an equivocal response. Immunologic analysis of these patients before therapy revealed a surprisingly high incidence of immune abnormalities. We conclude that intravenous immune globulin may be useful in the treatment of selected patients with chronic epilepsy unresponsive to anticonvulsants.\r"

  ".W": "During the last several years, there has been increasing interest in the use of intravenous immune globulin for immunosuppression. Although the mechanism(s) of action remains to be delineated, immune globulin therapy has been shown to be effective in some antibody-mediated disorders. In Rh disease, antibody-induced cytopenias, myasthenia gravis, and the clotting disorder associated with anti-factor VIII antibody, intravenous immune globulin has had therapeutic benefit. It was of interest that intravenous immune globulin may partially ameliorate the tendency toward dilation of the coronary vessels in Kawasaki disease. If this disorder represents a vasculitis of the small feeding vessels of the coronary arteries, could this agent influence other forms of collagen vascular disease? Pilot studies in dermatomyositis and polymyositis and systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis indicate benefit from intravenous immune globulin therapy. In these studies we used a high-dose protocol consisting of 1 gm/kg/day of immune globulin for 2 days every 4 weeks. In patients with either myositis or systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, beneficial effects were seen. In the former group of patients, increased proximal muscle strength and reduction in creatine kinase levels were observed. In the latter group of patients a marked reduction in systemic features was observed. The amount of corticosteroids required was reduced in both groups of patients. These studies indicate the potential for intravenous immune globulin in collagen vascular disorders and the need for carefully controlled trials of this form of therapy.\r"

The response rate was 72%. The majority of respondents were directors who considered themselves generalists. Five demographic variables used in data analysis were hospital size, education level, registration status, years of experience, and perception of practice as generalist or specialist. Student's t-test and analysis of variance were the principal methods of statistical analysis. Results indicated that respondents supported dietetic specialization; however, they emphasized the value of undergraduate generalist preparation as enhancing job performance and preventing fragmentation of the profession. Respondents indicated that specialization should follow professional work experience and additional education. Respondents stressed that The American Dietetic Association should be responsible for determining the process of dietetic specialization. Education level was the variable most likely to affect response. Respondents with education beyond the baccalaureate level were more likely than those with only a bachelor's degree to agree that specialization should occur after professional experience and at the graduate level.\r"

  ".W": "Students in a large introductory nutrition course were divided into two groups, one that received training on estimating food quantities and one that received no instruction. Training consisted of 10-minute sessions in which 76 subjects (in groups of 10) passed around and viewed food models labeled with their portion sizes while one of the investigators verbally indicated the quantities. Immediately following instruction, the trained subjects individually estimated portion sizes of one of four displays of six foods: two solids (meat loaf and fish), two liquids (milk and soup), and two amorphous items (spaghetti and apple sauce). The second group of subjects, who had received no training, also estimated the same portion sizes of the same foods in the same displays. The four displays were set up in separate rooms, with the same foods and portion sizes in each, but different container size combinations were used (smaller vs. larger containers). Both training and type of food had a significant effect; training improved estimations, and, in general, solids were better estimated than liquids, which were better estimated than amorphous items. Although results were mixed, women tended to estimate more accurately than men. There was some tendency for estimates to be more accurate when made for foods in small containers. The authors conclude that a training session enhances the accuracy of individuals estimating food quantity and that accuracy of estimates differs for different food types.\r"

The subjects were 26 perimenopausal women, aged 48 to 56 years, who were participants in a longitudinal osteoporosis study. Diets of the subjects were studied during the winter and summer of one year. Subjects filled out a food frequency questionnaire and the next week completed 4-day food intake records according to instructions from the researchers. The mean daily intake of calcium estimated from the food frequency questionnaire was 928 mg in the winter and 912 mg 6 months later. Ranges in the winter were 227 to 2,243 mg calcium and in the summer 198 to 3,063 mg calcium. The 53-item FFQ included descriptions of portion sizes and a calcium index for each item and had options for two frequency periods. The calcium level estimated from the questionnaire correlated (r = .73 in winter and r = .84 in summer) with the estimated amount from 4-day records. A seasonal difference was not found. The brief time (less than 5 minutes by a dietitian) required to calculate the amount of calcium consumed daily from the food frequency questionnaire could make it an important clinical tool.\r"

Patients were interviewed at three days and again at three weeks following emergency department discharge. The number of new prescriptions given to both groups in the emergency department was similar (elderly 41%; nonelderly, 31%). The elderly were as likely as the nonelderly to know the correct name (elderly, 88%; nonelderly, 87%), dosage schedule (elderly, 90%; nonelderly, 90%) and purpose (elderly, 85%; nonelderly, 94%) of their new medications. There was no difference in patients' understanding of the diagnosis (elderly, 72%; nonelderly, 72%) or in medication compliance (elderly, 81%; nonelderly, 74%). Elderly patients were more likely to keep scheduled follow-up appointments (87% vs 65%; P less than .05). Despite these similarities the elderly had worse medical outcomes at three weeks; 67% of the elderly were better and 20% were worse, including seven patients who required interim hospitalization, four of whom died. In contrast, 82% of the nonelderly were better and only 4% were worse (P less than .01). None of the nonelderly required hospitalization or had died. Functional impairments were more common in the elderly both at baseline (elderly, 26%; nonelderly, 6%; P less than .01) and at three weeks (elderly, 27%; nonelderly, 5%; P less than .001). Independent predictors of poor medical outcome included age greater than or equal to 65 (P less than .009) and functional impairment at baseline (P less than .022).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were divided into nine groups based on their age; groups A to I consisted of patients aged 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80-89 years, respectively. Serum thyroxine (T4), triiodo-thyronine (T3), and thyroglobulin levels were highest in group B (patients aged 10-19 years) and decreased progressively with advancing age. T3/T4 ratio was also highest in group B and decreased progressively with age. These data reconfirmed that the degree of hyperthyroidism is milder in older patients. The prevalence of positive microsomal and thyroglobulin antibodies was highest in group B (patients aged 10-19 years) and progressively lower in older groups, suggesting that an association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is less prevalent in aged patients. We suggest that hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease is mild in aged patients because responsiveness of the thyrocyte to the abnormal stimulator, thyrotropin-receptor antibody, may be reduced. Such reduced responsiveness may not be due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, since the prevalence of antithyroid antibodies is lower in aged than in younger patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease.\r"

The sampling frame was community-dwelling women aged 30 years and over who had telephones. Random digit telephone survey methods were used to identify a sample of 470 eligible subjects. Of those eligible to be included, 350 or 74.4% completed the interview. Analysis of data from the 171 respondents aged 50 years or greater indicated that women aged 65-80 years had a significantly lower rate of screening mammography than did women aged 50-64 years (means 2 = 6.6, P = .01). When further analysis was done to take into account the effects of education and of income on these rates, the association of age with mammography utilization was no longer statistically significant. Among women who recalled their physician advising a mammogram, 88% had had one performed. Among women who could not recall their physician advising a mammogram, 7% had had one. The impact of physician advice was statistically significant (means 2 = 110.3, P less than .001). Physicians recommended screening mammography less for patients with low level of education (means 2 = 21.6, P less than .001), low income (X2 = 7.8, df = 2, P = .02) and greater age (means 2 = 14.2, P = .003). We conclude that utilization of screening mammography in the community studied is related more strongly to education and to income than to age. The bivariate association of mammography utilization with age may be attributable to a cohort effect, rather than an age effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Campylobacter pylori, a spiral-shaped bacterium, commonly colonizes the gastric epithelium where it induces chronic gastritis; this organism has also been implicated in the etiology of chronic peptic ulcer disease. Once introduced to the gastric mucosa or an area of gastric metaplasia, it tends to migrate to the vicinity of the epithelial tight junction where it probably utilizes host urea and other substances to sustain itself. Campylobacter pylori also produces a proteolytic enzyme that degrades mucin. As the mucous layer slowly degrades, noxious luminal contents such as acid and pepsin have an opportunity to diffuse closer to the epithelium. We hypothesize that C. pylori, which is sensitive to low-pH environments, eventually migrates away from the compromised area to an area where the mucous layer is still protective. The injured epithelial focus left behind either regenerates its mucous layer and heals, or ulcerates depending upon the balance between other aggressive and protective factors. This interaction between C. pylori and the mucous layer is then repeated at the organism's new location. This hypothesis is consistent with existing data regarding C. pylori. It explains how C. pylori can be present in most duodenal ulcer patients and many gastric ulcer patients, as well as in otherwise healthy individuals. It also explains why ulceration is localized rather than diffuse when it does occur.\r"

Ninety-two percent (306 patients) of the entire group were diagnosed endoscopically, and all were followed prospectively. In the study group of the older patients there were fewer smokers, but more patients used steroids and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and had more arteriosclerotic heart disease than the younger control group. Presenting signs and symptoms were similar in both age groups, although painless upper gastrointestinal bleeding was more common in the elderly, and pain, when present, tended to be milder. Bleeding episodes were more prevalent in the older age group. Another difference between the groups was the larger incidence of concurrent gastric ulcer and DU observed endoscopically in the study population. Steroids and NSAIDs could be etiologically connected to bleeding in the older patients, as well as to their relative lack of pain. We conclude that DU in the elderly tended to present atypically and that pain was not the major symptom of activity. This places a different emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic criteria.\r"

  ".W": "Dieulafoy's disease is an underdiagnosed cause of massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The mortality rate is extremely high and the diagnosis is usually made at autopsy. Operation has been deemed the treatment of choice for Dieulafoy's disease in the past decades. Here, however, we report successful therapeutic endoscopy in eight cases of Dieulafoy's disease in a period of 20 months. Six patients (75%) were in shock before therapy. Six received heat-probe thermocoagulation, one received pure alcohol (99.8%) injection and one received hypertonic glucose solution (50%) injection. No perforation or recurrent hemorrhage occurred in the following period of 11.2 +/- 3.4 months (SEM) in six patients. The other two died of unrelated illness. In the near future, therapeutic endoscopy may replace surgery in the management of Dieulafoy's disease.\r"

This tumor shrank spontaneously, leaving only a small shallow ulcer. The resected specimen showed a minute focus of malignant lymphoma in the ulcer base. The other was a 73-year-old man who had a tumor with central ulceration on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum. Endoscopic biopsy revealed a malignant lymphoma. This tumor disappeared 60 days later. The patient refused surgery and remains well with no evidence of recurrent disease at this writing, 44 months later. Although there have been several case reports of spontaneous regression, partial or complete, of gastric malignant lymphoma, our cases seem to be the ones best proven.\r"

Mean postoperative weight loss was -13.7 +/- 1.59%; mean daily caloric intake was 31.7 +/- 2.41 kcal/kg/day, with 70% of subjects ingesting less than 30 kcal/kg; P/kg was 1.2 +/- 0.09, with 21% of patients ingesting less than 1 g P/kg/day; mean ratio of nonprotein energy to 1 g nitrogen intake was 142 +/- 8.74:1, with only 24% of patients attaining a ratio greater than 150:1; and mean fat malabsorption was 37.4 +/- 4.6%. Hemoglobin (Hb), serum albumin, prealbumin iron, and folate were more often abnormal in the early postoperative period, whereas transferrin and vitamin B12 concentrations deteriorated later. alpha 1-Antitrypsin clearance was abnormal in almost all patients (indicating an intestinal protein loss), and the pancreolauryl test was abnormal in 60%. Neither morphological nor absorptive alterations of the small bowel nor an abnormal transit time or bacterial overgrowth was found. We conclude that inadequate caloric intake appears to be the main cause for malnutrition after total gastrectomy, but that caloric losses caused by steatorrhea and enteric protein leakage must be subtracted from intake, thus decreasing the amount of available calories.\r"

Vasculitis in the form of arteritis identical to that seen in polyarteritis nodosa was present microscopically in the cholecystectomy specimens. One patient presented with systemic symptoms, and the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa was established after arteritic lesions were identified in the cholecystectomy, liver biopsy, and appendectomy specimens. In another patient, the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa was established after a retrospective identification of one additional site of arteritis in the appendix removed 5 years prior to cholecystectomy. In another, gallbladder vasculitis was associated with scleroderma; the patient was studied thoroughly at autopsy shortly after cholecystectomy, and no evidence of polyarteritis nodosa was found. In the last two, gallbladder vasculitis was not associated with systemic diseases.\r"

Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated from bacterial culture of a biopsy specimen obtained by sigmoidoscopy.

Radiographic evaluation of the colon showed segmental strictures which were interpreted as Crohn's disease. Medical treatment was not helpful. Neither gross endoscopic appearance nor multiple biopsies of the esophagus, stomach, and colon were diagnostic. Finally, laparotomy with full-thickness biopsies of the stomach and colon revealed linitis plastica. The clinician should be alert to colonic metastases from gastric linitis plastica, for it can produce focal or segmental strictures, mimicking more common colonic diseases such as Crohn's disease. A full-thickness biopsy is often necessary for a firm diagnosis. We review the literature on this occurrence, highlighting the clinical and radiologic spectrum, as well as the organ systems most often affected when gastric linitis plastica metastasizes.\r"

Mycotic superinfections masked and delayed the diagnosis in our patient for several years. Only when typical pyoderma gangrenosum lesions developed on the legs at the site of trauma and responded dramatically to systemic corticosteroids was the correct diagnosis established. Pyoderma gangrenosum with secondary fungal infection was thus distinguished from deep ulcerated skin fungal infection simulating pyoderma.\r"

The intraductal tumor was attached to the segmental bile ductal wall, where a tumor measuring 2.0 x 0.9 cm was found in the parenchyma. The parenchymal tumor was continuous with the intrabiliary mass. Histologically, the tumor was a hepatocellular carcinoma showing acidophilic granular cytoplasm with occasional hyaline globules and was structurally arranged in a vague trabecular pattern. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for alpha-fetoprotein and alpha 1-antitrypsin, but was negative for keratin.

  ".W": "The adult murine epidermis harbors two separate CD45+ bone marrow (BM)-derived dendritic cell systems, i.e., Ia+, ADPase+, Thy-1-, CD3- Langerhans cells (LC) and Ia-, ADPase-, Thy-1+, CD3+ dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC). To clarify whether the maturation of these cells from their ill-defined precursors is already accomplished before their entry into the epidermis or, alternatively, whether a specific epidermal milieu is required for the expression of their antigenic determinants, we studied the ontogeny of CD45+ epidermal cells (EC). In the fetal life, there exists a considerable number of CD45+, Ia-, ADPase+ dendritic epidermal cells. When cultured, these cells become Ia+ and, in parallel, acquire the potential of stimulating allogeneic T cell proliferation. These results imply that CD45+, Ia-, ADPase+ fetal dendritic epidermal cells are immature LC precursors and suggest that the epidermis plays a decisive role in LC maturation. The day 17 fetal epidermis also contains a small population of CD45+, Thy-1+, ADPase-, CD3- round cells. Over the course of 2 to 3 wk, they are slowly replaced by an ever increasing number of round and, finally, dendritic CD45+, Thy-1+, CD3+ EC. Thus, CD45+, Thy-1+, ADPase-, CD3- fetal EC may either be DETC precursors or, alternatively, may represent a distinctive cell system of unknown maturation potential. According to this latter theory, these cells would be eventually outnumbered by newly immigrating CD45+, Thy-1+, CD3+ T cells--the actual DETC.\r"

  ".W": "Anti-T12 is a murine IgM mAb that recognizes the 130-kDa CD6 glycoprotein on mature human T lymphocytes. Examination of the in vitro effects of this mAb on freshly isolated T cells demonstrates that anti-T12 can induce T cell activation. Such activation is macrophage-dependent, and optimal stimulation occurs with 0.2 to 5 micrograms/ml of purified mAb. This response to soluble mAb is detectable at day 4 to 5 of culture, and peak [3H]TdR uptake is observed at day 7. In a highly similar fashion, the mAb causes a marked augmentation of the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction, without altering the kinetics of that response. Although optimal anti-CD3 mAb induced mitogenesis is unaffected by anti-T12, suboptimal stimulation of macrophage-depleted T cells by small amounts of immobilized anti-CD3 can be dramatically enhanced when anti-CD3 and anti-T12 are cross-linked together. A soluble nonmitogenic anti-CD3 mAb completely inhibits anti-T12-mediated T cell activation. IL-2R expression is induced by anti-T12 stimulation in 10 to 30% of T cells, and T cell proliferation is substantially inhibited by anti-IL-2R mAb, indicating that anti-T12 induced T cell activation and proliferation utilizes an IL-2-dependent pathway. Isolated CD4+ but not CD8+ cells are stimulated to proliferate, but the CD8+ cells in unseparated T cell preparations activated by anti-T12 do proliferate comparably to the CD4+ cells in such cultures. These data indicate that relatively weak activation of T cells via the TCR/CD3 complex may be augmented significantly by CD6-mediated signals induced by the anti-T12 mAb. The findings suggest that the CD6 T cell membrane protein may have the capacity to function as a physiologically important structure involved in the regulation of T cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "90010109\r", 
  ".W": "The effector mechanism of skin allograft rejection has been characterized as Ag specific, rejecting cells that express the target alloantigen but sparing those that do not. However, the rejection of MHC class II disparate skin grafts, in which very few cells (Langerhans cells) actually express the target Ia Ag could conceivably proceed by either one of two distinct rejection mechanisms. One possibility is that Ia- cells are destroyed by a sequence of events in which CD4+ T cells, activated by Ia+ LC, elaborate soluble factors that are either directly cytolytic or that recruit and activate non-specific effector cells. The alternative possibility is that activated CD4+ T cells elaborate soluble factors which induce Ia expression on Ia- cell populations, and that these Ia+ cells are subsequently destroyed by effector cells specific for the induced Ia alloantigens. We found that rejection of Ia+ LC was not of itself sufficient to cause rejection of skin grafts, indicating that skin allograft rejection is contingent on the destruction not only of LC but of other graft cell populations as well. We then investigated whether CD4+ T cells rejected allogeneic skin grafts in an antigen specific fashion. To do so, we engrafted immunoincompetent H-2b nude mice with trunk skin grafts from B6----A/J allophenic mice because such skin is composed of mutually exclusive cell populations expressing either H-2a or H-2b histocompatibility Ag, but not both. The engrafted mice were subsequently reconstituted with H-2b CD4+ T cells. The CD4+ T cells destroyed keratinocytes of A/J origin but spared keratinocytes of B6 origin, even though neither cell population constitutively expresses target IAk alloantigen. The targeted rejection of A/J keratinocytes but not of B6 keratinocytes indicates that the target Ia alloantigen must have been induced on Ia- A/J keratinocytes, rendering them susceptible to destruction by anti-Iak-specific CD4+ effector cells. These data demonstrate that CD4+ T cell rejection of skin allografts is mediated by Ag-specific CD4+ cytolytic T cells and hence, requires the induction of target Ia alloantigens on epidermal cells within the graft.\r"

  ".U": "90010111\r", 
  ".W": "The human fetal bone marrow B cell compartment of 14- to 21-wk gestational age was examined phenotypically and with respect to Ig H chain commitment and diversity. A dramatic expansion of fetal marrow B cell pools at 16- to 18-wk gestational age characterizes a rapid and concerted chain of differentiation events. Transiently up to 1/4 of nucleated marrow cells are CD20+/CD21+ cells which begin to express surface Ig other than IgM. Limiting dilution analysis of EBV-infected marrow cells delineated a virtually exclusive commitment to IgM production until 15 wk and the absolute and relative number of these cells were small (approximately 5% of comparable adult values). In parallel to the rapid increase in total B cell pools size, cells committed and able to secrete any of the five Ig isotypes are generated by 16-wk gestational age and by 18 wk the frequencies of these cells rapidly reach levels typical for adult peripheral tissue such as blood or lymph node. Fetal L chain diversity always anticipated that observed in adult serum. In addition to rising pool sizes and diverse IgH expression, EBV transformability is a major variable during this period of B cell development with up to 2/3 of B lineage cells transformable, about half of which are pre-B cells. By 21-wk gestational age transformable pre-B cells have disappeared and (as in adult tissue) approximately 10 to 20% of CD20+ cells are transformable. The rapid, concerted expression of full H chain diversity during a narrow period in fetal development is unique to marrow and implies a lymphopoietic process in a privileged site rather than an immunologic differentiation event. During this event, the relative proportions between the different IgH classes expressed, resembled that found in adult tissue, perhaps suggesting that B cell inherent programming rather than only antigenic forces determine heavy chain choice. The staggered expression, early in postnatal life, of IgH regions 3' of the C mu locus may reflect regulatory functions rather than inherent immaturity of the B lineage.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 75 EBV-transformed pre-B and B-cell lines from fetal bone marrow at 14 to 18 wk of gestation was cloned for phenotypic, functional and molecular genetic studies. B-cell type volume regulation in response to hypotonic stress, low level CD9 (BA2), and, perhaps biased by our use of EBV, functional EBV receptors with expression of CD21 (B2) determinants characterized the most immature cells detected. These \"B-progenitors\" contained EBV genomes, maintained Ig H and L chain (as well as TCR) constant region genes in germ-line configuration and did not express other B, T, or myeloid lineage-associated surface markers including CD20 and MHC class II determinants. Such cells may represent B progenitor cells preceding classical pre-B-lymphocytes in pathways of B cell differentiation. Reminiscent of Abelson virus-induced transformation of immature murine B cells, EBV transformability together with the above properties may be the earliest markers of B lineage commitment in man. The expression of MHC class II Ag, CD20, C mu-H and then L chain rearrangements and expression followed in less immature pre-B lymphocytes and permitted a classification of lines into discrete subgroups of increasing maturity. The physical organization of the H chain locus in a given line was a stable characteristic. However, fetal pre-B cell lines showed considerable intraclonal heterogeneity with respect to H chain gene expression and that of differentiation markers such as CD20. Subcloning experiments indicated that this heterogeneity reflected clonally stable expression patterns distributed among subclones in an all-or-none fashion. The induction, by IL-6, of L chain expression in some but not all of these clones was linked to the presence of C mu transcription products, consistent with a possible regulatory role of mu protein in L chain rearrangement and expression. Although pre-B cell differentiation likely follows inherent programming, external signals seem able to hasten development along prescribed, hierarchical differentiation pathways.\r"

In normal thymus, TCR delta 1+ cells accounted for approximately 2% of the CD3+ thymocytes and were about three times more numerous in the medulla than in the cortex. TCR delta 1+ cells were mostly constituted by the delta TCS1 reactive subset (average ratio delta TCS1/BB3: 3.7). In the tonsil, the TCR delta 1+ cells (about 3% of CD3+ elements) were mainly located in the interfollicular area, where they frequently tended to arrange around high endothelium venules. In most samples, TCR delta 1+ cells were distributed beneath to the tonsil epithelium. Unlike thymus, the majority of TCR delta 1+ cells were usually constituted by the BB3-reactive subset (average BB3/delta TCS1 ratio: 2.0). A similar predominance of BB3+ over delta TCS1+ cells was also observed in normal peripheral blood. The spleen was the organ with the highest concentration of TCR delta 1+ cells that, like in the thymus, were mostly represented by delta TCS1+ elements. Noteworthy, the TCR delta 1+ cells were preferentially located in the splenic sinusoids while TCR alpha beta-bearing lymphocytes mostly occupied the periarteriolar sheaths of penicilliary arteries. The majority of neoplastic T cell proliferations studied lacked to express the TCR gamma delta. Two cases of beta F1-(TCR alpha beta-) T lymphoblastic lymphoma, however, were TCR gamma delta+ (delta TCS1+/BB3-). Both of them showed a stage II cortical phenotype, e.g., CD1+/CD3+/CD4+/CD8+/TCR delta 1+. Among inflammatory conditions, an increase of BB3+ cells was observed in close association with necrotic areas in cases of Kikuchi's and tuberculous lymphadenitis. The significance of this finding is under study.\r"

This indicates that non-MHC loci play an important role in the regulation and development of GVHD. Non-MHC loci have been shown to regulate GVHD in a murine model where acute GVHD results from i.v. injection of C57BL/6J spleen cells into B6D2F1/J [C57BL/6J X DBA/2J)F1) recipients while chronic GVHD results from injection of DBA/2J spleen cells. In contrast to the hyperproduction of Ig and auto-antibodies that is characteristic of the chronic GVHD that occurs after injection of DBA/2J cells, injection of DBA/2Ha cells was found to induce CTL and suppressor cells characteristic of the acute GVHD that results from injection of C57BL/6 cells into B6D2F1/J recipients. Genetic analysis indicated that one autosomal locus is responsible for the different GVHD responses of DBA/2J and DBA/2Ha cells and that the DBA/2Ha allele is dominant. Further studies indicate that the different responses by DBA/2J and DBA/2Ha cells is not due to functional differences between the two sets of cells but by a radiosensitive B6D2F1 recipient immune response which discriminates between the DBA/2J and DBA/2Ha spleen cells.\r"

  ".U": "90010116\r", 
  ".W": "It has previously been determined that transformed human B cells may be infected by and retain integrated human T cell lymphotropic virus, type I (HTLV-I). Although HTLV-I is primarily associated with transformation of human T lymphocytes, immortalized B cell populations have arisen after cocultivation of normal B cells and irradiated HTLV-I-infected T cells. To test whether HTLV-I infection might be involved in this B cell transformation process, we characterized five independent HTLV-I-infected and -immortalized human B cell clones. All five clones contained clonal HTLV-I integrations, expressed cell surface IgM, and secreted IgM in quantities varying from 0.1 to 4.0 micrograms/ml. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cell lysates failed to detect synthesis of HTLV-I gag, env, or tat gene products, and cellular RNA dot blot analysis detected varying levels of HTLV-I gene transcripts in only three of the five clones. The secreted IgM from culture supernatants were affinity purified, and were found to selectively immunoprecipitate an acidic protein (isoelectric point = 5.0) of 66,000 m.w. (p66) from purified radioiodinated HTLV-I virions. This p66 copurified with metabolically labelled HTLV-I-infected B cell IgM from HKA-3 cells. Although HTLV-I RNA transcripts were present at low levels, the absence of HTLV-I proteins in HKA-3 cells made it unlikely that p66 was related to the major HTLV-I envelope glycoprotein, gp62. Anti-idiotypic mAb directed against the IgM produced by one B cell clone (HKA-3), as well as purified HTLV-I virions (containing p66), stimulated HKA-3 cell proliferation. Preincubating the anti-Id antibody or HTLV-I with excess HKA-3 IgM abolished the binding of either to HKA-3 cells. These data suggest that HTLV-I infected cells produce a cellular protein (p66), which is incorporated into and copurifies with HTLV-I virions, and which in at least one case (HKA-3) may act as a mitogenic stimulus, potentially contributing to the HTLV-I mediated transformation process.\r"

In order to evaluate the possibility of modulating the development of tissue lesions by an anti-Id antibody, we have raised an IgG2b anti-Id mAb specific to the 6-19 mAb. The cryoprecipitation of 6-19 mAb was completely inhibited in the presence of excess amounts of anti-Id mAb in vitro. In vivo, pretreatment of BALB/c mice with anti-6-19 anti-Id mAb inhibited development of skin vasculitis and glomerulonephritis induced by the 6-19 mAb. The cryoglobulin formation was markedly diminished due to enhanced elimination of the 6-19 mAb from the circulation. In contrast, pretreatment with an IgM anti-IgG3 rheumatoid factor mAb neither protected nor aggravated the development of tissue lesions. These results suggest possible implications in the anti-Id treatment of similar vascular diseases in man.\r"

In a previous report we demonstrated that human IL-6 stimulates IL-2 production and proliferation of purified T cells, in conjunction with the insolubilized anti-TCR V beta 8 mAb, F23.1. Here we show that when CD4+ T cells are rigorously purified to greater than 99% CD4+CD8-, they respond only weakly to F23.1 and IL-6. Instead, there is an additional requirement for IL-1, which dramatically synergizes with IL-6 to induce prolonged (greater than 7 days) proliferative responses and IL-2 production. Similar results were observed when the highly mitogenic anti-CD3 mAb 145-2C11 was substituted for F23.1. The proliferation induced by F23.1, IL-1, and IL-6 was substantially (greater than 80%) inhibited by a mAb to mouse IL-2, and was not inhibited by an anti-IL-4-mAb. In accordance with this finding, medium conditioned by the activated CD4+ cells contained large amounts of IL-2, which increased over a 7-day culture period. These results demonstrate that IL-6 and IL-1 stimulate T cell proliferation by inducing production of the autocrine growth factor IL-2. In addition, the two lymphokines must be present simultaneously for activation to occur. The possible roles of IL-6 and IL-1 in IL-2 gene regulation and in Ag-induced T cell activation are discussed.\r"

We report that PHA-stimulated accessory cell-depleted tonsillar T cells fractionated on the basis of their density show a high degree of heterogeneity in their proliferative response to these cytokines, inasmuch as small dense lymphocytes essentially fail to respond whereas large cells proliferate extensively. This differential response could be ascribed to the fact that only the large cells produced IL-2 under these circumstances, thus providing unequivocal evidence for the existence of an IL-2-mediated step in the activation of human T cells by IL-1 and IL-6. The synergy between IL-1 and IL-6 was found to result from their complementary effects on the production of and response to IL-2, with IL-1 playing a preponderant role in the induction of IL-2, and IL-6 being required, in addition to IL-1, for optimal IL-2-responsiveness. Using small tonsillar T cells, it was possible to show that, concomitant with the enhanced response to IL-2, IL-6 induced a marked increase in cell size and in protein synthesis. In the absence of other factors, this activation was not followed by entry into S phase, suggesting that the essential role of IL-6 in T cell activation is to induce the cells to move from G0 to G1, where they become more responsive to the small amounts of IL-2 induced by IL-1.\r"

In order to determine whether IL-4 acts directly on pre-B cells, we sorted out B220+, sIg- cells from bone marrow of young adult (C3H X C57BL/6)F1 mice. These purified populations of pre-B cells (greater than 95%) were incubated with and without 4 to 200 U/ml of rIL-4, and the generation of new B lymphocytes in these cultures was followed for several days. We found that the frequency of newly generated B lymphocytes (%sIg+) was similar in control and in IL-4-containing cultures. However, the total number of B lymphocytes was significantly higher in IL-4-containing cultures. This high number of B lymphocytes was a result of an increased survival of cells in IL-4-containing cultures. The effect was IL-4 specific because anti-IL-4 antibodies completely prevented this phenomenon. We thus conclude that IL-4 does not induce the maturation of pre-B cells but may be important in the process of B lymphocytes generation by providing a signal for survival of these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles are a class of RNA-containing particles in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. They consist of uridylate-rich small nuclear RNA complexed with several proteins. snRNP particles U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 all contain a common protein core consisting of proteins B'/B, D, D', E, F, and G. In addition to this core, U1 snRNP particles contain proteins 70K, A, and C, whereas U2 snRNP particles contain proteins A' and B\". Almost any of the small nuclear RNA-associated polypeptides is targeted by autoantibodies in the sera from patients with SLE or related connective tissue diseases. We immunized a genetically non-autoimmune mouse with recombinant human B\" protein and obtained three mAb reactive with native U2 snRNP particles. Two of these mAb particles cross-reacted with U1 snRNP, 9A9 and 11A1, via epitopes present on the U2 snRNP B\" protein as well as on the U1 snRNP-specific A protein. A third mAb 4g3, reacted exclusively with U2 snRNP via a unique epitope on protein B\". Two epitopes mapped at the carboxy-terminal region of the B\" protein, whereas binding of the third mAb involved both amino- and carboxy-terminal amino acids of the B\" protein. Epitope mapping, employing a DNAse I fragment library of the B\" cDNA, revealed that the three mAb-reactive sites were discontinuous. Autoantibodies in sera from patients with SLE and other connective tissue diseases competed for binding with the mAb, implying that the mAb define a major autoantibody-reactive region on protein B\".\r"

  ".W": "In experiments to determine whether serum antibodies in patients with Crohn's disease could be used as probes for detecting potentially etiologic Ag in the patients' tissues, we found that peroxidase (HRP)-labeled IgG from healthy persons, as well as from the patients, bound to normal colonic and small intestinal epithelium, mostly or entirely to goblet cells. The binding was due to a reaction involving the Fc region of IgG because HRP-labeled Fc fragments of IgG bound, but HRP-Fab, HRP-IgA, and HRP-bovine albumin did not, and because binding of HRP-IgG was inhibited competitively by unlabeled IgG or Fc fragments but not by IgG Fab fragments or IgA. These immunohistochemical results were confirmed by ELISA with microtiter wells coated with a sonicated homogenate from human colonocytes. The epithelial IgG Fc binding site was characterized by SDS-PAGE as consisting of a high Mr (greater than 200,000 Da) and a 78,000-Da component. It bound all four subclasses of human IgG and bound aggregated as well as monomeric IgG. It is distinct from known human Fc-gamma R by lack of recognition by mAb to those receptors and differences in affinity for various subclasses of human and murine IgG. This unique IgG Fc binding site might be involved in immunologic defense of the gut, perhaps by mediating reactions between foreign Ag and the contents of goblet cells.\r"

  ".U": "90010128\r", 
  ".W": "Mesangial cells represent specialized pericytes in the renal glomerulus that contribute to the regulation of a variety of glomerular functions. Recently we and others have shown that cultured mesangial cells bind and take up immune complexes in an Fc-dependent manner leading in turn to generation of PGE2, reactive oxygen, and platelet-activating factor. The present studies were designed to further characterize potential Fc-gamma R on mesangial cells. Binding assays with either monomeric or heat aggregated (HA) [125I] labeled rat subclass-specific IgG were performed at 4 degrees C for 2 h on subcultured rat mesangial cells. Monomeric rat IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG1 and HA IgG2a bound only nonspecifically. Saturable Fc-dependent binding occurred for HA IgG2b and HA IgG1 though maximal binding and affinity were much higher for IgG2b. The presence of an Fc-gamma R was confirmed by surface protein iodination of mesangial cells (MC) and immunoprecipitation with either a polyclonal or mAb 2.4G2 prepared against murine Fc-gamma R. Both antibodies precipitated a 45-kDa iodinated protein band from cultured rat MC that comigrated with that from murine macrophage J774 cells on SDS-PAGE. This protein band also reacted with the polyclonal anti Fc-gamma R antibody on immunoblots. In contrast rat renal papillary epithelial cells were negative. The 45-kDa protein recognized by the rat anti-Fc-gamma R antibody 2.4G2 probably represents the binding site for HA IgG2b, as the 2.4G2 antibody also blocked binding of HA IgG2b. By immunofluorescence microscopy all MC stained positively with the polyclonal anti-Fc-gamma R antibody. A cDNA probe for the Fc-gamma RII-alpha on murine macrophages hybridized to mRNA from cultured rat MC which was of the same size (though less abundant) as that from J774 macrophages. These results further characterize the Fc-gamma R on cultured rat MC, and raise the possibility that the mesangial Fc-gamma R may play a role in the handling of immune-complexes by the renal glomerulus.\r"
