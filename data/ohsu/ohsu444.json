  ".W": "A study of 100 consecutive patients requiring multiple coronary artery bypasses was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of routine use of multiple internal mammary artery (IMA) anastomoses. In 99 patients the IMA was used and in 80 patients bilateral IMA bypasses were done. In 15 patients multiple anastomoses with a single IMA precluded the need for bilateral IMA bypasses. In only 4 patients were bilateral IMA left to be contraindicated. By combination of use of both IMAs, free grafts and sequential grafts, the IMA accounted for 70% of the 318 anastomoses in these 100 patients. Scrupulous attention to technique and the use of the operating microscope are necessary to achieve multiple IMA anastomoses. It was concluded that the IMA can be used to supply the majority of anastomoses needed for coronary artery revascularization in nearly all patients.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsatile high-flow cardiopulmonary bypass (2.5 l/m2/min with a rectal temperature of 28 degrees C) combined with the Pulsatile Bypass Pump (Kontron Instrument) has been used at Fukuoka Children's Hospital in 259 cases of open-heart surgery in patients less than 1 year of age for a period of 5 years beginning July 1982. The overall results were satisfactory with a surgical mortality of 6.2% (VSD: 96 cases/2 deaths, TGA: 48/1, TAPVD: 34/3, Complete ECD: 15/1, IAA: 10/1, DORV: 10/1, HLHS: 7/4, TOF: 6/0, Truncus Art: 5/0, Others 28/3). The mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 123 +/- 50 minutes during which time the patients had a positive water balance of only 28 +/- 38 ml per kg of body weight. The lowest positive water balance was noted in the patient group with 60-75 mmHg in peak systolic pressure and 30-45 mmHg pulse pressure divided by the pulsatile wave form. This value was significantly lower than other groups of patients with lower or higher peak systolic and pulse pressures. Urinary output during the first 24 hours after operation was 4.1 +/- 1.3 ml/kg/hour. Weight gain on the first postoperative day was 10 +/- 43 g per kg of body weight, and the duration of postoperative respiratory support was 4 +/- 5 days. In conclusion, pulsatile high-flow cardiopulmonary bypass is useful in infant open-heart surgery in light of operative techniques, water balance and postoperative recovery.\r"

Their condition rapidly deteriorated, and they died within 20 days of the onset of symptoms. Skin biopsy specimens from two patients showed mild leukocytic infiltration in the epidermal basal layer and upper dermis. Immunostaining by the ABC method showed that most of these infiltrating cells were suppressor/cytotoxic T cells. HLA study of peripheral lymphocytes from two patients and their families revealed that the patients' HLA phenotypes were incompatible from their children's HLA findings. Y chromatin was present in the lymphocytes of the skin biopsy specimen of a female patient. Based on the clinical picture, skin biopsy, HLA study, and Y chromatin study, the authors strongly suspect post-transfusion GVHD as the etiology of postoperative erythroderma, although these patients lacked any known immunodeficiency.\r"

  ".W": "GH secretion and mRNA levels were measured in cultured cells obtained from six human pituitary somatotroph tumors to investigate their hormonal and intracellular regulation. The responses were variable between tumors, but, in general, mRNA levels were less responsive than GH release to in vitro manipulation. GH-releasing factor [GRF-(1-29) amide; 10 nM] increased GH release and mRNA levels in three of four tumors tested to 30-97% above control values, but the fourth tumor was unresponsive. Somatostatin (1 microM) inhibited GH release significantly in four of the six cases, to 35-79% of control levels, but had no inhibitory effect on GH mRNA accumulation, in contrast to earlier studies on rat pituitary tissue. Bromocriptine (100 nM) likewise inhibited GH release (50-75% of control), but not GH mRNA levels, in the four tumors tested. Forskolin (10 microM; used to activate adenylate cyclase) stimulated GH release and mRNA levels in the two cases that responded most clearly to GRF, but had no significant effect in the other tumors; however, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (100 nM) had no consistent effect on mRNA levels despite stimulating secretion in four of six cases. Thus, there was considerable variation in responses among the tumors tested; however, the responsiveness to GRF was approximately paralleled by that to forskolin, consistent with the suggestion that adenylate cyclase activity and responsiveness are variable among these tumors. Furthermore, the divergent effects of somatostatin on GH release and mRNA suggest uncoupling between its receptor and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 31 patients (28 girls and 3 boys), ranging in age from 3.2-7.9 yr, with precocious adrenarche defined by the presence of early sexual hair development, no signs of virilization, and bone age within +3 SD of the mean for chronological age. To determine if this symptom complex stemmed from any form of nonclassical (late-onset) congenital adrenal hyperplasia, an ACTH stimulation test was performed on each patient using a standard 0.25-mg dose of Cortrosyn, given as an iv bolus. Twelve pubertal children (7 girls and 5 boys) and 18 prepubertal children (11 girls and 7 boys) served as normal controls. Baseline and stimulated 17-hydroxypregnenolone (17-OHPreg), 17-hydroxyprogesterone, (17-OHP), 11-deoxycortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, and cortisol levels were measured. Using published nomogram standards for serum 17-OHP response to ACTH, no child with precocious adrenarche was diagnosed as having nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Eight girls, however, had a stimulated 17-OHP value that exceeded the mean response for pubertal and prepubertal controls by more than +2 SD [range, 295-670 ng/dL (8.94-20.3 nmol/L)]. Stimulated 11-deoxycortisol values [less than 400 ng/dL (11.6 nmol/L)] ruled out any cases of nonclassical 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency. No patient had nonclassical 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, as defined by both the stimulated 17-OHPreg and the 17-OHPreg/17-OHP ratio to be more than +2 SD above the mean for pubertal children [1354 ng/dL (41.0 nmol/L) and 10.4, respectively]. In conclusion, we could not provide any biochemical evidence for nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia in a large group of children with precocious adrenarche.\r"

The efficacy and tolerability of chronic treatment with CAB in 30 female hyperprolactinemic patients, aged 18-52 yr (6 microadenomas, 3 macroadenomas, and 21 functional hyperprolactinemias), were studied. In a group of 10 patients who received CAB (0.8 mg once weekly or 0.4 mg twice weekly) for 8 weeks PRL levels normalized while on treatment and remained normal (8 patients) or greatly reduced (1 patient) for 1-2 months after discontinuation of the drug. Twenty-six patients underwent chronic treatment (6-12 months) with an initial dose of 0.5 mg once weekly, subsequently increased to 1-2 mg in 10 patients and decreased in the other 2. Due to severe side-effects CAB was discontinued in 3 patients, in 1, 8, and 12 weeks. A significant reduction of PRL levels was already observed after the first week of treatment (mean +/- SEM basal values, 90.1 +/- 13.3 vs. 29.5 +/- 6.3 micrograms/L; P less than 0.001). Twenty-two patients had normal PRL levels in 1-36 weeks (mean, 6 weeks) with 0.5-2 mg CAB. Twenty-two patients resumed regular menses; 2 patients became pregnant after 3-11 months of treatment. Thirteen patients complained of side-effects (nausea, hypotension, headache, gastric pain, dizziness, and weakness) that disappeared with time in 10 of them. The comparison with a previous bromocriptine treatment regimen in 20 patients had shown that the number of patients requiring discontinuation of the latter drug was significantly higher (7 vs. 3 patients; P less than 0.001). However, 2 patients who needed to discontinue CAB were able to tolerate bromocriptine therapy. A computed tomographic scan performed after 12 months of therapy in 7 patients showed a significant reduction (50%) of the adenoma in 5. In conclusion, our results show that CAB is a well tolerated new dopamine agonist with long-lasting activity that represents an advance in chronic medical treatment of hyperprolactinemic conditions.\r"

Nonprotein calories were supplied to 6 subjects as 72% carbohydrate (high carbohydrate diet), and 5 subjects received 80% of their nonprotein calories as lipid (high lipid diet). Protein intake was constant (1.0 g/kg IBW) in both groups. During 1 study interval we gave injections of GH (0.1 mg/kg IBW) every other day for 3 weeks (weeks 2-4), and in the other interval injections of vehicle were given. Subjects ingesting the high carbohydrate diet excreted significantly less urinary nitrogen [660.2 +/- 124.1 mmol/day (mean +/- SD)] than those who received high lipid (794.2 +/- 198.5 mmol/day; P less than 0.001), and GH injections reduced nitrogen excretion in the high carbohydrate subjects (532.8 +/- 123.8 mmol/day), but not in the high lipid subjects (743.7 +/- 126.6 mmol/day). The subjects receiving the high carbohydrate diet had a significant increase in serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; from 36.2 +/- 9.7 to 55.9 +/- 6.6 nmol/L) and urinary C-peptide excretion (from 43.9 +/- 25.6 to 60.8 +/- 29.4 nmol/day) in response to GH. The IGF-I response attenuated slowly over the 3-week treatment interval. On the other hand, the high lipid group had lesser increases in IGF-I (from 31.0 +/- 6.5 to 41.7 +/- 8.8 nmol/L) and C-peptide excretion (from 24.3 +/- 28.9 to 29.8 +/- 32.8 nmol/day), and IGF-I concentrations declined to control values after only 5 days of GH injection. We believe that this initial IGF-I response was due to an antecedent 35-Cal balanced diet. The mean increment in serum FFA 4 h after GH injection was significantly less in subjects fed the high lipid diet (0.53 +/- 0.40 meq/L) than in those fed the high carbohydrate diet (0.83 +/- 0.43 meq/L). GH injections produced more body fat loss than injections of vehicle whether expressed as percent body fat lost (GH, 3.7 +/- 1.0%; vehicle, 2.8 +/- 0.7%, P less than 0.05) or as the fraction of weight lost as fat (fat loss/weight loss; GH, 0.81 +/- 0.13; vehicle, 0.64 +/- 0.08; P less than 0.005). There was an inverse correlation between the percentage of body fat lost and mean urinary C-peptide excretion during GH injections (r = -0.70; P less than 0.05), suggesting that stimulation of insulin secretion by GH might antagonize the tendency of GH to promote fat loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Previous racial comparisons of bone mass have been limited by racial differences in body weight and socioeconomic, health, and nutritional status. This cross-sectional study examined bone density in 105 black and 114 white healthy nonobese women, 24-65 yr old, using dual photon absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and single photon absorptiometry of the distal radius. Bone density at both sites was higher in blacks at all ages than in whites. When adjusted for age and body mass index, mean bone density was 6.5% higher in blacks at both spine and radius (P less than 0.0001). The cross-sectional rate of decline of vertebral bone density was similar between races; however, radial density increased 3.8%/decade (P = 0.03) in premenopausal blacks under age 46 yr, while it declined 3.2%/decade (P = 0.09) in premenopausal whites. The racial difference in slopes in these premenopausal women is significant (P = 0.002). These findings suggest that attainment of higher peak bone mass and delayed onset of bone loss contribute to the lower incidence of osteoporotic fractures in black women.\r"

  ".W": "In 1968, this laboratory reported that muscle capillary basement membrane thickening was present in approximately 50% of nondiabetic individuals who had a strong genetic predisposition for developing diabetes mellitus. In the present manuscript we report the 20-yr follow-up observations in this group of prediabetics. We were able to obtain information regarding the presence or absence of diabetes in 17 of 33 subjects (51.5%). In these 17 individuals, 8 (47%) developed diabetes over the ensuing 20+ yr of observation. Initial (1964) glucose tolerance tests in the subjects that developed diabetes were not significantly different from those that did not develop diabetes. One- and 2-h glucose values on follow-up (4-8 yr later) glucose tolerance tests were significantly higher in the group that developed diabetes. On initial biopsy, muscle capillary basement membrane width was similar in the 2 groups; in the follow-up specimens the mean muscle capillary basement membrane width tended to be greater in the group that ultimately developed diabetes, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, in the group that developed diabetes the follow-up muscle capillary basement membrane width increased significantly compared to the initial measurement, whereas in the nondiabetic group the muscle capillary basement membrane width decreased with time (diabetics, +75.50 +/- 23.66; nondiabetic, -14.44 +/- 28.71 A/yr; P less than 0.05). Seven of 8 (87%) of the individuals who developed diabetes showed progressive thickening of their muscle capillary basement membrane thickness, whereas in the nondiabetic group 5 of 8 had a decrease in width. These results suggest that an increase in muscle capillary basement membrane width over time might serve as a marker to detect individuals who are at increased risk to develop diabetes. The detection of an increased susceptibility for diabetes could potentially allow for interventions that could delay or prevent the development of diabetes.\r"

Subjects received a constant infusion of biosynthetic GH, and clearance was calculated by dividing the infusion rates by steady state serum concentrations of GH. We found that adult men have a significantly more rapid MCR of human GH than women (125.2 +/- 7.6 mL/min.m2 in men; 89.4 +/- 7.7 mL/min.m2 in women) and that both men and women have a significantly more rapid MCR of human GH than prepubertal children (66.8 +/- 7.7 mL/min.m2). Sex differences in GH clearance rates may account at least in part for the lower mean serum GH concentrations in pubertal, but not prepubertal, males compared to those in females. The differences in clearance between prepubertal children and adult women and men suggest that the male-female differences in GH clearance are due to androgen effects on GH clearance or on the relative proportions of free and protein-bound GH in serum.\r"

Hormonal status was assessed, and a subset of 10 women with endometriosis underwent evaluation of calcium absorption and excretion. Menstrual cycles were regular in all women, and hormonal medication had not been administered during the 3 months before evaluation. Estradiol and progesterone varied as expected with the day of the cycle. Fasting calcium excretion was normal. Mean cortical and trabecular bone mass values in women with endometriosis were compared to those in the normal women. Women with endometriosis had significantly decreased cortical and trabecular bone mass. Cortical bone mass in normal subjects was 1263 +/- 11 Hounsfield units (HU), whereas in endometriosis, cortical bone mass measured 1133 +/- 16 HU (P less than 0.0001). Normal trabecular bone mass was 226 +/- 10 HU compared to a mean trabecular bone mass of 173 +/- 9 HU (P less than 0.0001) in endometriosis. Despite the decrease in bone mass documented by quantitative computed tomography, hormonal and calcium dynamics were normal and, therefore, did not appear to be significant etiological factors in regard to the bone loss. Since immunological abnormalities have been reported in association with endometriosis, immune factors may play a role in the development of bone loss in endometriosis and might be of pathogenic significance in this reproductive disorder.\r"

Central venous blood sampling was performed every 2 min in 10 healthy men between 6-9 h and in 3 male patients with osteoporosis for over 6 h. Pulsatile PTH secretion was identified for healthy men and controls. Narrow pulses and bursts of narrow pulses (broad pulse) could be distinguished. Six narrow pulses per h with 26 +/- 16 ng/L amplitude and 1 burst of narrow pulses/h were detected for the intact hormone. One narrow pulse/h with 25 +/- 12 ng/L amplitude and 1 burst of narrow pulses (broad pulse) every 2 h were found (Pulsar) for PTH-(44-68). Intact and PTH-(44-68) exhibit in part a concordant pattern. Results from 3 patients with osteoporosis show a decreased amplitude and frequency of pulsatile PTH secretion. The same decreased pattern was demonstrated in a postmenopausal osteoporotic woman. A constant decline in ionized calcium elicits major secretory episodes of PTH, and ionized calcium increases after major secretory episodes of PTH. We conclude that pulsatile secretion of PTH in healthy young men is the physiological mode of secretion. Low pulsatile secretion of PTH might be related to low turnover osteoporosis.\r"

  ".U": "89380750\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) bind with high affinity to specific proteins in human serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and amniotic fluid. In serum, IGFs are bound to a complex with an apparent mol wt of 150K in which an acidstable binding protein of 53K, termed BP-53, is found. In amniotic fluid, a different binding protein with an apparent mol wt of 25K, termed hBP-25, has been identified. This binding protein is secreted by endometrial cells and has been shown to block the binding of IGFs to their membrane receptors and inhibit the mitogenic action of the IGFs on human choriocarcinoma cells. It has been proposed that hBP-25 modulates the action of IGFs on endometrial tissue, especially during pregnancy. We have identified two binding proteins produced by an endometrial adenocarcinoma, HEC 1A, neither of which is related structurally or genetically to hBP-25. One is present in two glycosylated forms with apparent mol wt of 37K and 40K, both of which are immunoprecipitated with an antiserum made to BP-53. Both forms are reduced to a core protein of 30K upon digestion with endoglycosidase-F. Furthermore, BP-53-specific RNA was detected in HEC 1A cells. A second binding protein with an apparent mol wt of 32K was also detected and did not increase in size upon treatment with endo glycosidase F. These two binding proteins were partially purified by a combination of wheat germ agglutinin and IGF affinity chromatography, and polyclonal antibodies were generated. The polyclonal antiserum specifically recognizes a 32K protein in human CSF, suggesting that the HEC 1A cells produce the same binding protein that is predominant in CSF. The findings suggest that IGF action in the endometrium may be modulated by more than a single binding protein, and that at least three structurally distinct human IGF binding proteins exist.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of PTH secretion by extracellular calcium was studied in parathyroid tissue obtained from patients with hyperparathyroidism (adenoma or hyperplasia) using both an amino (N)-terminal RIA as well as an immunoradiometric assay (intact assay) specific for the intact hormone. The parathyroid glands separated into three major groups when examined in terms of absolute amounts of PTH secreted, degree of suppressibility, and set-point for calcium (the concentration of calcium causing half-maximal inhibition of PTH release). In cell preparations from group A (two different adenomas, two hyperplastic glands from a patient with renal failure, and a hyperplastic gland from a patient with hypophosphatemic rickets), both assays showed comparable PTH release (agreeing within 2-fold), similar degrees of suppressibility and similar, if not identical, set-points. In group B (two adenomas and one hyperplastic gland from a patient with renal failure), PTH secretion, as measured in the N-terminal assay, was 3- to 6-fold more than that measured in the intact assay. The set-points and maximal degrees of suppressibility were, however, still comparable. In group C [two adenomas and one gland from a patient with hypophosphatemic rickets (the sister of the patient in group A)], no suppressibility was observed when PTH release was measured using the intact assay (i.e. less than 50% suppression of PTH release at 2-3 mM Ca2+). In one of these three glands, the N-terminal assay was used in addition to the intact assay, and no suppressibility was present with either assay. Thus, in general, the effects of extracellular Ca2+ on PTH secretion from pathological parathyroid tissue were similar when assessed with both an N-terminal and an intact assay, at least with respect to setpoint and maximal suppressibility. In a few cases, maximal PTH release was greater when measured with the N-terminal assay, consistent with substantial release of N-terminal fragments in addition to intact PTH. In addition, nonsuppressible glands were not uncommon when PTH release was measured by the intact assay, confirming previous studies with less specific assays.\r"

  ".W": "The establishment of human term trophoblast cells in culture is dependent on the method of cell preparation, growth medium used, and presence of serum. Using freshly isolated term placental cells, we investigated 1) the effects of two different methods of removal of nontrophoblast cells and two culture media on trophoblast aromatase specific activity, cellular morphology, and hCG secretion over 72 h; and 2) the sensitivity of these hormonal parameters to cAMP added 24 h after the initiation of culture. Under conditions in which aromatase is responsive to cAMP, we studied the effect of removing serum after 24 h in culture with serum. After trypsin digestion of placental villi, isolated trophoblast cells were either treated with ammonium chloride (A) or purified on Percoll density gradients (P) and then grown in monolayer culture with medium 199 plus 10% fetal bovine serum (M) or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) plus 20% fetal bovine serum (D). Regardless of the method of treatment or growth medium used, aromatase specific activity increased 10- to 15-fold 24 h after plating, continued to increase from 24-48 h, and then decreased (AM) or remained constant (AD, PM, and PD) from 48-72 h. Addition of cAMP significantly increased activity in DMEM-grown cells (PD or AD) at both 48 and 72 h. Aromatase activity in PM cells grown with cAMP increased at 48 h, then decreased to near-control levels by 72 h; however, in AM cells, no response to cAMP was observed relative to control cells. Secretion of hCG was suppressed for the first 48 h in all cultures, but increased by 72 h (greatest increase in AM cultures). cAMP significantly increased hCG secretion 48 h after its addition under all conditions. We further evaluated the response of the Percoll-purified DMEM-grown cells (PD) to cAMP after serum removal at 24 h. Cells deprived of serum showed significantly higher aromatase specific activity over the entire culture period compared with serum-grown cells. Secretion of hCG increased 2- or 3-fold in the presence or absence of serum, respectively, after 72 h in culture. cAMP increased aromatase specific activity by 1.8- and 1.4-fold at 48 h and by 2.5- and 2.4-fold at 72 h in serum-containing and serum-free cells, respectively. The secretion of hCG increased 11- to 14-fold at 72 h under both serum-containing and serum-free conditions, respectively. The results show that cAMP can act as an intracellular messenger in the regulation of both aromatase activity and hCG secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Serum was pretreated with 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the supernatant (PEG-pretreated serum) was then used in the following studies. FRTL-5 cells were preincubated in 5H medium and incubated for 2 h with PEG pretreated serum, and cAMP was measured. All 11 patients with untreated hyperthyroid Graves' disease with strongly positive thyroid-stimulating antibody activity had normal TSA, because only 5.6% of their immunoglobulin G was recovered in the PEG-pretreated serum. In 32 normal pregnant women, 29 (91%) had positive TSA. Their TSA showed statistically significant positive correlations with serum hCG and free T4 levels, and a negative correlation with serum TSH levels. Moreover, when hCG was absorbed from sera by incubation with the solid phase anti-HCG monoclonal antibody, a significant positive correlation was observed between the rate of decrease in hCG and that in TSA. In conclusion, 1) TSA exists in the sera of normal pregnant women, which reflects hCG itself; and 2) thyroid glands of normal pregnant women may be stimulated by TSA to induce a slight suppression of TSH but not sufficient to induce overt hyperthyroidism.\r"

  ".U": "89380757\r", 
  ".W": "CGS-16949A is a new orally active nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor which is more than 100-fold more potent than aminoglutethimide. This compound is an imidazole derivative, and therefore, its possible effect on cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme activities in the adrenal gland was evaluated. In vitro investigations with dispersed normal and hyperplastic human adrenocortical cells showed that CGS-16949A at 10(-7)-10(-6) M is a potent 11 beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, which inhibits ACTH-stimulated cortisol release to a similar extent as an equimolar concentration of metyrapone (IC50 for both compounds, 10(-7)-5 X 10(-7) M). Etomidate was a more potent 11 beta-hydroxylase inhibitor (IC50, approximately 10(-8) M), while 10(-7)-10(-6) M ketoconazole caused (via 17 alpha-hydroxylase inhibition) a similar inhibition of cortisol release as 10(-7) M CGS-16949A (IC50, 10(-7)-5 X 10(-7) M). The 11 beta-hydroxylase inhibition by CGS-16949A was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in the release of precursor steroids by the adrenocortical cells in vitro, including deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and androstenedione. Aldosterone release was suppressed 50% by 10(-9) M CGS-16949A, while the IC50 for cortisol in the same cells was 10(-7) M. Aldosterone release by the dispersed adenoma cells obtained from a patient with primary aldosteronism was also significantly suppressed by CGS-16949A. We concluded that 1) the new nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor CGS 16949A is an inhibitor of 11 beta-hydroxylase which is equipotent to metyrapone. At present it is unclear whether the compound at the dose that causes complete aromatase inhibition in vivo also affects stress-induced cortisol release in man. 2) CGS-16949A exerts a very potent inhibitory effect on normal aldosterone release (IC50, 10(-9) M) and on tumorous aldosterone secretion. CGS-16949A might, therefore, be a drug that can be used in the treatment of primary hyperaldosteronism.\r"

Two thirds of the patients had elevated plasma CgA. Sandostatin administration suppressed CgA in 12 of the 14 patients. In 8 of 10, the clinical response to Sandostatin paralleled the reduction in CgA levels. There was a strong correlation between the change in CgA levels and the respective blood concentration of the hormone produced by the tumor. Serial measurement of CgA may provide an additional means of monitoring these tumors and their secretory activity where other measures are not available.\r"

P levels decreased in all observations; the mean (+/- SE) decrease was 34.2 +/- 0.2% 60 minutes after the meal (p = 0.0001). By contrast, mean cortisol (F) levels increased 29.5 +/- 14.4% (p = 0.11) 60 minutes after the meal and postprandial F levels were variable both within and between individuals. The correlation between the change in P and F, 60 minutes after the meal, was not significant (r2 = 0.015, p = 0.77). These findings indicate that: 1) The postprandial state is associated with a transient and large increase in the metabolic clearance rate of P and/or a change in the volume of distribution of P and 2) Increased F levels after meals alone do not appear to account for a postprandial decrease in P.\r"

Five patients with extensive psoriasis and no significant preexisting renal disease were treated with oral cyclosporine (average dosage, 5 mg/kg per day; average duration of treatment, 9 weeks). Changes in serum creatinine measurements made immediately before and at the end of treatment were compared with changes in glomerular filtration rate as determined by 125I-iothalamate clearance. During treatment, the average serum creatinine value only increased from 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 mg/dl (+/- standard deviation), whereas iothalamate-based estimates of glomerular infiltration rate decreased from 100 +/- 22 to 63 +/- 37 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p less than 0.02). Simultaneous 125I-iothalamate and 24-hour creatinine clearances were obtained in two patients at the end of treatment and at 2 weeks after cyclosporine therapy. Glomerular filtration rates determined by iothalamate clearance were 14% to 30% lower than those calculated by 24-hour creatinine clearances. Neither serum creatinine measurements nor creatinine clearances (whether calculated or measured) accurately reflect the cyclosporine-induced decline in renal function as determined by glomerular filtration rate. In contrast, 125I-iothalamate clearance is a more accurate measurement of glomerular filtration rate, which provides a sensitive marker for monitoring potential cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity.\r"

Nine had positive patch test reactions of which seven were allergic to compounds used in local treatments. Allergic reactions in more than one patient were seen to neomycin sulfate (three patients), bacitracin (two), and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate and betamethasone-17-valerate (two). Although no comparable control group was similarly studied, the frequency of sensitization appears to be increased in patients with familial benign chronic pemphigus.\r"

Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to one of four bilateral, paired-comparison treatment groups. Patients underwent 3 weeks of treatment, after which they were followed up for an additional week. After 3 weeks hydrocolloid occlusion with triamcinolone acetonide yielded a significantly better response than the cream alone or the hydrocolloid dressing alone, but the new dressing was comparable to a plastic film occlusive dressing of triamcinolone acetonide. After discontinuation of treatment, however, the sites that had been treated with hydrocolloid-occluded triamcinolone acetonide retained the better results. Topical steroids under hydrocolloid occlusive dressing may be a useful alternative to steroids alone for treatment of localized recalcitrant psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "To distinguish a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from a trichoepithelioma can be difficult even for an experienced dermatopathologist. Previously reported differentiating histologic features are relative criteria that may be shared by both tumors. In a review of 30 consecutive cases each of trichoepitheliomas, keratotic BCC, and routine BCC, classic criteria were compared with papillary mesenchymal body formation. Papillary mesenchymal bodies are distinct fibroblastic aggregations that represent abortive attempts to form the papillary mesenchyme responsible for hair induction. Papillary mesenchymal bodies were observed in 93% of all trichoepitheliomas, 7% of all keratotic BCC, and 0% of all routine BCC. Hair bulb formation was observed in 30% of trichoepitheliomas and in none of the BCC. We conclude that papillary mesenchymal body formation is an easily recognizable histologic criterion that is more reliable in differentiating these two tumors than standard criteria, including epidermal connections, keratinization, calcification, foreign body reaction, fibrosis, stromal retraction, tumor mucin, ulceration, frondlike epithelial pattern, and the inflammatory response.\r"

Thus there is a clear need for nonclinical diagnostic criteria for Behcet's disease. The nonspecific cutaneous hyperreactivity response, pathergy, may serve as an important diagnostic indicator. A test for pathergy may also clarify the role of an immune complex mechanism in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease. In our study of 11 patients with Behcet's disease, deposition of immunoglobulins or complement was not found 4 hours after histamine or saline injection. In contrast, 24 hours after histamine or saline injection, 10 of 11 patients responded positively both clinically and histologically during the active stage of their disease. Vasculitis was noted in only two patients. Thus in most patients no evidence of an immune complex mechanism was observed. We conclude that any nonspecific intracutaneous injection is a good clinical tool for the diagnosis of Behcet's disease.\r"

As in humans, with chronic ultraviolet radiation, these mice develop elastic fiber hyperplasia, followed by elastosis and ultrastructural degradation. Collagen is damaged and its metabolism is altered, while the normally low levels of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans are greatly increased. With this model we have described the effects on dermal connective tissue of UVB (290 to 320 nm), UVA (320 to 400 nm), and the combination of the two. We have also assessed the protective effects of sunscreens. We found that a significant amount of photodamage was repaired when ultraviolet radiation was stopped. Subepidermally in a former region of elastosis, a band of new normal dermis was laid down. Enhancement of the repair was achieved with topical all-trans-retinoic acid in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Retinoic acid was also found to induce angiogenesis in unirradiated mice.\r"

Previously reported associations between occupational respiratory symptoms and cigarette smoking, and symptoms of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine were confirmed.

Hives consistently began at the end of menses and lasted for 1 to 2 weeks. A comprehensive evaluation excluded underlying malignancy and infection. There was no evidence of extracutaneous visceral involvement consistent with the primary hypereosinophilic syndrome. A 6-month prospective evaluation was performed, during which daily hive symptoms were recorded and weekly determinations of eosinophils, serum total IgE, progesterone, estradiol, and 24-hour urine histamine were obtained. Eosinophil counts (range, 4002 to 37,350 cells per cubic millimeter) increased in association with the onset of hives and decreased to baseline levels after their resolution. The 24-hour urine histamine peaked at the onset of each urticarial episode. When serum progesterone levels increased, the hives were quiescent and peripheral eosinophils decreased to baseline levels. Progesterone caused in vitro dose-related inhibition of antihuman IgE-induced histamine release from peripheral basophils of this patient. Treatment with oral medroxyprogesterone resulted in remission of urticaria and a decrease in eosinophil counts. This patient represents a unique case of chronic cyclic urticaria and hypereosinophilia that appears to be modulated by the effects of progesterone.\r"

In contrast, the affinity of IgG1 antibodies decreased after immunotherapy, and both the titer and affinity of IgG1 antiphospholipase A2 remained significantly lower compared to IgG4 1 to 2 years after treatment. Analysis of affinity heterogeneity suggested a loss of IgG1 high-affinity antibody-producing clones during immunotherapy and a preferential expansion of IgG4 clones. High-affinity IgE antibodies were found in untreated allergic patients, and preliminary results suggest that immunotherapy may result in an early marked decrease in the affinity of IgE antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Allergic reactions after insect stings may have a delayed onset, differing from the usual immediate anaphylactic pattern. Ten patients, aged 6 to 78 years, had allergic reactions 1 to 2 weeks after an insect sting. Six patients had had multiple stings preceding the reaction. In two instances, immediate anaphylaxis also occurred. Four of the 10 patients had serum sickness-type reactions; two other patients had more severe anaphylactic symptoms, including throat edema. All patients in this group had venom-specific IgE; four of the 10 patients had serum venom-specific IgG. Eight patients subsequently received venom immunotherapy (VIT). There have been no reactions from seven re-stings. Five patients had generalized hives starting 6 to 24 hours after an insect sting. All patients in this group had venom-specific IgE; three patients have received VIT. Two other patients developed hives, one with throat edema 3 days after an insect sting. Both patients had high titers of serum venom-specific IgE; neither patient has received VIT, one patient because of extreme sensitivity. These observations suggest that after an insect sting, patients may develop delayed-onset allergic symptoms that range from typical anaphylaxis to serum sickness and are mediated by venom-specific IgE. VIT is recommended for patients with these reactions.\r"

  ".W": "The late-phase response to nasal challenge with antigen is associated with a mixed inflammatory cell influx in which the eosinophil demonstrates the earliest and greatest proportionate rise. We investigated the evidence for activation of the eosinophil during the late response by measuring the concentration of the eosinophil-derived mediator major basic protein (MBP) and the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) in nasal-lavage fluids before and for 11 hours after antigen challenge in 13 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The subjects received oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover manner for 2 days before each of two antigen challenges. After placebo pretreatment, significant increases over diluent baseline (4.5 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) occurred in the levels of MBP in nasal-lavage fluid during the early (9.8 +/- 2.9 ng/ml; p less than 0.005) and late (15.3 +/- 4.8 ng/ml; p less than 0.01) responses to antigen challenge. Significant increases (p less than 0.05) in the concentration of EDN also occurred during the late response to antigen that correlated with the levels of MBP (r = 0.48; p less than 0.001). The cumulative late-phase increase in MBP correlated closely (rs = 0.96; p less than 0.005) with the total influx of eosinophils. Oral prednisone pretreatment significantly reduced the mean of each subject's peak late-phase concentration of both MBP (30.7 +/- 5.8 ng/ml versus 13.3 +/- 4.3 ng/ml; p = 0.005) and EDN (885 +/- 659 ng/ml versus 71 +/- 41 ng/ml; p less than 0.05). These data provide evidence for eosinophil degranulation during the late response and inhibition of this response by prednisone, supporting its pathogenetic role.\r"

Median concentrations encountered during feeding or cleaning (21 ng/m3) and injection or handling (13 ng/m3) were higher than those associated with surgery or sacrifice (3.1 ng/m3; p less than 0.01). Area samples in animal-holding rooms contained 3.4 ng/m3 during animal handling and 2.3 ng/m3 at other times. Very low concentrations were found in air outside the handling room, in unused laboratories, or outside air. We concluded that certain tasks incur a higher risk of allergen exposure but that exposure may occur anywhere within an animal laboratory environment.\r"

IgG antibodies against F-HSA were most prevalent in subjects who had received intravenous F. In no case (either presumed symptomatic to F or with IgG antibody against F-HSA) was there a correlation of serologic results with symptoms. We also reviewed inhalation disease caused by chemicals and proteins acting as immunogens and report that at this time there is no evidence that gaseous F meets the criteria for causation of inhalational IgG-mediated lung disease by clinical or serologic studies. Very high IgG antibody levels occur in respiratory immunologic inhalational disease, and the absence of these high IgG levels against F is strong evidence against F or F proteins being an inhalational antigen of significance.\r"

Also elevated are serum immunoglobulin antibodies directed against Aspergillus fumigatus, IgE-Af, serum IgG-Af, and serum IgA-Af. We measured serum IgA-Af, IgA1-Af, and IgA2-Af by ELISA to determine whether elevations of IgA-Af occurred before or during an exacerbation (like IgG-Af) or after (like IgE-Af). Ten exacerbations of ABPA were studied in seven patients with an average of 10 serial sera per patient analyzed. We used an indirect amplified ELISA with Af initially sensitizing microtiter wells. A \"serologic\" rise of immunoglobulin Af was identified when optical densities were twice the baseline sera. Serum IgA-Af was elevated over baseline before (n = 5) and during (n = 1) the time of an exacerbation. Serum IgA1-Af was elevated over baseline before (n = 5) or at the time (n = 5) of an exacerbation in all 10 cases. Serum IgA2-Af was elevated before (n = 2) and during (n = 5) exacerbations. Analogous to total serum IgE and IgG-Af, these experiments demonstrate substantial elevations of serum IgA-Af, IgA2-Af, and particularly, IgA1-Af before or during exacerbations characterized by roentgenographic infiltrates. The data are consistent with a contributory role of IgA-Af in the pathogenesis of ABPA.\r"

In RAST inhibition, Cocos IIa (a high-molecular-weight protein) obtained by fractionation of Cocos II on Mono Q column (fast protein liquid chromatography) (Pharmacia) was found to be the most potent allergen in Cocos WPE, followed by Cocos VI and Cocos VII, which are low-molecular-weight proteins.

  ".W": "During the course of an open immunotherapy (IT) study of ragweed (RW)-allergic patients, nasal mediator release was studied by provocation testing. All subjects had a history of seasonal RW rhinitis, positive skin puncture test to RW, and RW-specific IgE by RAST. Nasal challenge was performed with serial dilutions of RW extract, before and after 12 weekly injections, providing a cumulative dose of 0.22 microgram of Amb a I. Serum IgE and IgG and basophil histamine release with RW were also measured. By 12 weeks of IT, when only 1% of the usual maintenance level dose had been administered, mean histamine release and TAME-esterase activity in nasal washes decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01). Prostaglandin D2 release did not change. Skin sensitivity decreased (p less than 0.05), whereas RW-specific IgE increased (p less than 0.05). No significant change in basophil histamine release was observed for RW or a control antigen. Only six of 40 subjects had an RW-specific IgG rise greater than 0.05 microgram/ml. Changes in nasal sensitivity did not correlate with the increases in IgE or IgG or with the change in skin test sensitivity. These present data indicate that there is a significant decline in nasal sensitivity to inhaled RW very early in the course of IT. There is, however, no indication of a relationship between the decreased nasal sensitivity and the production of RW-specific IgG antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Two variants of coxsackievirus group B, type 3 (CVB3) differ in ability to induce myocarditis in Balb/cCUM mice. Infection with the highly pathogenic variant (CVB3M) stimulates autoimmunity to normal cardiocyte antigens, and tissue injury results primarily from an autoreactive cytolytic T lymphocyte (ACTL). Animals infected with the less pathogenic CVB3o variant do not develop ACTL, although CVB3o replicates to high titers in the heart and polyclonal neutralizing antisera fail to distinguish between the two variant virions. The present study uses two IgM mAb derived by fusing spleen cells from CVB3M-infected mice with NS-1 cells. These mAb investigate important differences between the virus variants that may explain why only selected infections trigger autoimmunity. mAb 8A6 is a virus-neutralizing antibody that prevents infection of HeLa cells and cultured cardiocytes by attaching to the virus. mAb 10A1 also interferes with infection but presumably reacts to the virus receptor on the susceptible cells and shows little or no binding to the virions. While 8A6 is equally effective in neutralizing both CVB3o and CVB3M, suggesting that antigenic epitopes on both variants are either identical or highly cross-reactive, 10A1 distinguishes between the variants, suggesting that the pathogenic and less pathogenic viruses use distinct cell surface receptors. Competitive binding studies using radiolabeled CVB3M and either of the unlabeled variants confirm this hypothesis. Both mAb effectively prevent CVB3M-induced cardiac damage in vivo. mAb 10A1 also inhibits autoreactive ACTL lysis of cardiocytes, indicating that the autoimmune effectors may recognize the virus receptor, and that the receptor utilized by a virus may prove important in triggering auto-sensitization.\r"

To understand better its mode of action, a number of murine mAb were developed against a recombinant (serine-17) HuIFN-beta (rHuIFN-beta ser) and screened by ELISA and neutralization of antiviral activity. The panel of antibodies, composed of both IgA and IgG immunoglobulins, were specific for HuIFN-beta and did not crossreact with HuIFN-alpha or gamma. Furthermore, three functionally distinct epitopes (designated as sites I, II, and III) were identified based on mAb neutralization of antiviral and antiproliferative activities of recombinant and natural HuIFN-beta. Antibodies directed to sites I and II neutralized the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of rHuIFN-beta ser, though the antiviral neutralization potency of the mAb to site II was approximately 10-fold less than mAb to site I. Antibodies directed to site I neutralized both recombinant and natural HuIFN-beta, although the antiviral neutralization potency was approximately 10-fold higher against rHuIFN-beta ser than the native protein. The mAb directed to site II did not demonstrate any significant neutralization of the antiviral or antiproliferative activity of natural HuIFN-beta but neutralized a recombinant HuIFN-beta containing the native sequence. Antibodies recognizing site III did not neutralize the biologic activity of either recombinant or natural HuIFN-beta. Thus, three epitopes on HuIFN-beta have been identified, two of which are associated with both antiviral and antiproliferative activities.\r"

  ".U": "89381328\r", 
  ".W": "Autoantibody to Sm Ag is a highly specific marker for the diagnosis of SLE. The Sm Ag exists in the cell nucleus as part of a ribonucleoprotein complex containing five small nuclear RNA. The major immunoreactive Sm species have been reported to be three polypeptides of m.w. 28,000/29,000 (B/B') and 16,000 (D). We report here that a m.w. 21,000 peptide is another major target of anti-Sm antibody. This peptide was originally identified by Western blotting as an acidic ribosomal protein (RP21) reactive with IgG from some SLE patients. Anti-RP21 is distinct from anti-ribosomal P protein antibody (anti-P) which has been previously identified as a lupus-specific autoantibody. Cell fractionation experiments showed that RP21 existed only in the ribosomal fraction and was never detected in other cellular compartments including nuclei. However, when nuclear extracts were used as Ag sources in immunoblotting, affinity-purified anti-RP21 was found to react with m.w. 28,000 and 16,000 peptides, suggesting that anti-RP21 reactivity might be due to the cross-reaction of anti-Sm. This was further confirmed by the evidence that two kinds of murine anti-Sm mAb independently derived from MRL/lpr mouse recognized RP21. These results indicate that anti-Sm antibodies in SLE are reactive with both nuclear and ribosomal ribonucleoproteins. Previous reports have described certain similarities, i.e., antibody subclass restriction and incidence, of anti-Sm and anti-P in both humans and autoimmune mice. Our present study demonstrated a close physical association of target molecules reactive with anti-Sm and anti-P, and might, therefore, provide some clue to the origin of these two types of lupus-specific autoantibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Human seminal plasma (SP) has been shown to affect several immunologic reactions in vitro. This might be due in part to the presence of proteins that specifically bind the Fc domain of IgG. By using mAb Leu 11a, Leu 11b, Leu 11c, and 3G8 we showed that the Fc binding of SP is associated with a molecule that antigenically resembles Fc gamma RIII. This molecule manifests specific affinity for solid phase-coupled IgG-Fc, and appears not be be cell membrane-associated. When compared with serum or blood plasma, its highest concentration was found in SP. Western blot analysis of SP performed with mAb Leu 11a, Leu 11b, Leu 11c, and 3G8 showed distinct bands at approximately 70 and 35 kDa, which contrasts with the broad area of electrophoretic mobility reported for membrane-bound Fc gamma RIII. These molecules in SP could influence maternal immune responses to paternal Ag during fertilization and pregnancy.\r"

The protein exhibited limited cross-reactivity with the channel-forming proteins of C and cytotoxic lymphocytes. It inhibited reactive lysis of E by human C5b-9. Inhibition occurred at the attachment stage of C5b-7 to target cells, rather than at the C8 or C9 stage of membrane attack complex assembly which is inhibited by HRF-M. In this respect, HRF-U acts analogously to S protein of serum, but no immunochemical relationship between these two proteins was detected. HRF-U might be derived from the soluble HRF detected in cytoplasmic granules of killer lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Using 35S-methionine metabolic labeling, we studied de novo synthesis and secretion of proteins by activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from two different sources. PMN isolated from inflammatory synovial fluid of patients with inflammatory joint disease were first analyzed. The protein synthetic activity of these cells was compared with that of nonactivated PMN isolated from the peripheral blood of the same patient. Similar studies were conducted on glycogen-activated PMN from the peritoneal cavity of rabbits and results were compared with nonactivated peripheral blood PMN isolated from the same rabbit. Cells were labeled for a period of 16 to 20 h and supernatants were analyzed by one and two dimensional gel electrophoresis. In both models, the activated PMN showed a marked increase in the synthesis and secretion of thrombospondin as identified by immunoisolation with antibodies to this protein. The production of thrombospondin by activated cells paralleled a similar increase in production of another extracellular matrix and cell adhesion protein, fibronectin. The proportion of thrombospondin synthesis and secretion relative to total protein was approximately 1% in both human- and rabbit-activated PMN. For fibronectin, this proportion was in the 0.02% range. Although fibronectin mRNA accumulation in activated PMN could be demonstrated by Northern blots, we were not able to obtain similar results for thrombospondin mRNA. This could be caused by the rapid turnover of this transcript because it is known to contain an adenine uridine-rich 3' untranslated sequence. We conclude that activated PMN are capable of producing thrombospondin. Furthermore, glycogen-activated rabbit peritoneal fluid PMN represent a valuable and relevant source of activated PMN for studying the protein synthetic events of these cells in the context of inflammation.\r"

Since the HP-like lesions were induced via respiratory route and by the causative antigen in human HP (farmer's lung), it seems that this murine model is useful for investigating the cell-to-cell interactions in human HP. To clarify the involvement of mast cells (MC) in the development of HP, T. vulgaris (90 micrograms/day) was transnasally administered to MC-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice (W/Wv) and their littermates (+/+) five times a wk for 3 wk. When the lungs were examined by scoring pathological findings and lung indexes, HP-like lesions were significantly less severe in W/Wv than in +/+, whose lesions were equivalent to those of C57B1/6. Bone-marrow-derived cultured MC from +/+ mice (98% purity) were obtained by in vitro culture mixed with WEHI-3B-derived conditioned medium which contained IL-3. When these MC were adoptively transferred to W/Wv mice (10(7) cells/mouse), the HP-like lesions in W/Wv mice were enhanced to be as severe as those in +/+. Importantly, significant numbers of MC were found in the lungs of MC-transferred W/Wv mice. These results suggest that MC play an important role in the development of the murine experimental HP.\r"

No correlation was found between a colony's Ag-presenting activity and its secretion of suppressor factors, nor did colonies unable to present Ag release factors that interfered with the detection of IL-2. In a second approach, paired subcultures from individual colonies were tested for their ability to present, to the same hybridoma, both native Ag and the \"preprocessed\" peptide of the Ag. The presentation of native Ag was restricted to the progeny of a minority of the cloned macrophage progenitors, but all of the progeny cultures presented the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the basis for differential Ag presentation may be in the manner in which the cloned macrophages degrade and process ingested Ag.\r"

In the present study, we have analyzed the HRS autoepitopes by two amino acid insertion linker mutagenesis of HRS proteins expressed in Cos 1 cells. A series of mutant HRS cDNA were constructed and the expressed proteins were tested for enzyme activity and for immune reactivity with a panel of sera with anti-Jo-1 antibodies. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that anti-Jo-1 antibodies recognize multiple conformation-dependent and independent epitopes on HRS and that the autoepitopes vary among different myositis patients.\r"

Remarkable frequency of the production of mAb against PS was observed with the immunization protocol. The mAb exhibited three distinct reactivity profiles ranging from highly specific to broadly cross-reactive. Among 61 hybridomas, 15 mAb were established for further analysis. The reactivities of three typical mAb, designated PS4A7, PS3A, and PSC8, are described. PS4A7 is highly specific to PS and no cross-reaction with other acidic phospholipids was observed. In the experiments using PS derivatives with a modified polar head group, PS4A7 was shown to bind to 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (PS) but not to 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-D-serine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-homoserine, indicating that the antibody recognizes the stereo-specific configuration of serine residue in PS. PS3A binds to both PS and phosphatidylethanolamine, whereas no cross-reaction with other acidic phospholipids was observed. The analysis using the derivatives of PS and phosphatidylethanolamine shows that the antibody recognizes the amino group of the phospholipid Ag and cannot distinguish the conformational structure of serine residue in PS. PSC8 represents the family of mAb that cross-react considerably with other acidic phospholipids.\r"

The reason for this unique tissue distribution is unknown. We report here that both the murine mast cell line PT18 and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells possess functional receptors for laminin, and exhibit adhesion, spreading and redistribution of histamine-containing granules on a laminin substratum. This adherence is enhanced in the presence of purified IL-3 and can be inhibited by antibodies to laminin and by antibodies to laminin receptors. Northern analysis showed a high level of mRNA for a 32-kDa laminin receptor in PT18 mast cells. Mouse bone marrow-derived cultures initially exhibited a low level of the mRNA expression. However, the expression of the laminin receptor mRNA is induced rapidly within 1 wk of culture with IL-3. Thus, mast cells exhibit functional laminin receptors that may explain the tissue distribution of mast cells and their accumulation at sites of tissue injury.\r"

  ".U": "89381391\r", 
  ".W": "Humans vary considerably in the antigen specificity of their immune responses to parasitic nematodes, and in the infection loads of individuals living in the same environment. The possibility that the former has a genetic basis operating through repertoire control of the immune system was investigated using infection of mice with the nematode Ascaris. The specificity of the antibody response was examined using excretory/secretory (ES) materials of the parasite as target Ag. No strain of mouse was found to recognize all of the potentially antigenic components of ES, and the Ag recognition patterns varied considerably from strain to strain. Using H-2 congenic mice on both the BALB and B10 backgrounds, it was established that the antigen recognition patterns were MHC-determined. Focusing on one particular component of ES, of Mr 14,000, only H-2s strains responded in IgG. This MHC restriction of the repertoire was confined to infection, and broke down under adjuvant-assisted immunization with the purified protein. The Mr 14,000 molecule was also found to be a potent allergen in a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay, and the IgE response to it was also restricted to H-2s. This haplotype was, however, a low IgE responder on the SJL background. There is, therefore, MHC control of the specificity of the immune response to this molecule, but non-MHC control of the amplitude of the IgE antibody response to it. Hybrids between responder and nonresponder strains (BALB/c x SJL)F1, responded to the Mr 14,000, but their responses to other ES components could not be predicted from the response patterns of parental strains. For example, the BALB/c parent responded to a 118-kDa component, but the SJL parent and the F1 progeny did not. Moreover, the response to a 41-kDa Ag was substantially down-regulated in the F1, whereas both parental strains responded vigorously. This new model system, therefore, has implications for MHC control of responses to the allergens of pathogens, and for the complex immunoregulation in heterozygotes in the context of infection.\r"

Its expression increased after NK cell activation by poly I:C administration. Biochemical analysis by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE indicated that FN was associated to cell surface and secreted in the supernatant in a molecular form similar to that of FN from L929 fibroblasts. In an attempt to understand the role of FN in the NK cell function, we found that an antibody against human plasma FN and its F(ab')2 fragment inhibited NK cytotoxicity against YAC-1 target at the effector cell level. Inhibition occurred at the postbinding level, because F(ab')2 anti-FN inhibited induction of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by YAC-1 target cells, whereas binding to target cells was not affected. The possible role of FN in the NK cytotoxic function is suggested.\r"

  ".U": "89381458\r", 
  ".W": "One explanation for the fact that certain genetically defined strains of mice prove to be resistant to effects of low dose ultraviolet B radiation on the induction of contact hypersensitivity is that ultraviolet B resistant mice possess a second pathway for antigen presentation through the skin--a pathway that is independent of epidermal Langerhans cells and beyond the reach of the damaging effects of ultraviolet B light. As a corollary, ultraviolet-B susceptible mice would be expected to be deficient in this pathway. Several experimental strategies were employed to determine whether Langerhans cells are required for the induction of contact hypersensitivity by epicutaneously applied hapten. The results reveal that tape-stripped skin supports the induction of contact hypersensitivity, whereas surgical excision of hapten-painted skin within 1 h of application fails to permit the development of contact hypersensitivity. Because the former selectively eliminates epidermal Langerhans cells while the latter deletes both Langerhans cells and dermal antigen-presenting cells, we conclude that either Langerhans cells or dermal cells are sufficient to provide antigen presentation in the induction of contact hypersensitivity. When large amounts of hapten are painted epicutaneously, or when hapten is injected subcutaneously or painted on sub-dermal tissues, contact hypersensitivity also results, indicating that induction of contact hypersensitivity does not require that antigen processing and presentation be provided by cutaneous cells. Reasons are presented for concluding that under physiologic circumstances induction of contact hypersensitivity by epicutaneous hapten application relies primarily upon the antigen-presenting capabilities of epidermal (Langerhans cells) and dermal cells.\r"

  ".W": "Human epidermal keratinocytes were established in culture using a low-Ca2+ (0.15 mM), serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) as the culture medium. Early passage keratinocytes (i.e., between passages 3-8) were incubated for 1 or 2 d in KGM, in KGM supplemented with 1.4 mM Ca2+, or in growth factor-deprived keratinocyte basal medium (KBM). The cells were concomitantly treated with all-trans retinoic acid (0.1-2.5 micrograms/ml), and cell growth was quantitated at the end of the incubation period. The keratinocytes were simultaneously examined for adhesiveness and production of two extracellular matrix molecules, e.g., thrombospondin (TSP) and fibronectin (FN). Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid inhibited proliferation of keratinocytes that were rapidly growing in KGM. Proliferation was also inhibited in KGM supplemented with 1.4 mM Ca2+, but all-trans retinoic acid did not reverse the morphologic features associated with differentiation induced by high Ca2+. In contrast to these effects, all-trans retinoic acid treatment of keratinocytes in KBM, in which the cells were normally quiescent, stimulated growth. In the presence of optimal concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (0.5 microgram/ml), the rate of keratinocyte proliferation in KBM was approximately 35% of the rate obtained in KGM (maximal proliferation rate). Keratinocyte adhesion (resistance to trypsin-mediated release from the substrate and attachment to the substrate) was inhibited by all-trans retinoic acid under all three conditions. In regard to extracellular matrix production, TSP production was inhibited by greater than 90% under all three conditions in the presence of all-trans retinoic acid. FN production was also inhibited but to a lesser degree. Concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid required to maximally inhibit keratinocyte adhesion and matrix production were higher (1.0-2.5 microgram/ml) than the concentration required to stimulate proliferation in KBM. These in vitro observations may have implications in the effects of retinoids on intact skin, including enhanced keratinocyte proliferation and thickening of the epidermis after topical application to photoaged skin and inhibition of proliferation and cell-cell cohesion after systemic administration in cases of psoriasis.\r"

Ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated skin fibroblasts showed a biphasic survival curve, as measured by colony-forming ability. The surviving fraction decreased rapidly up to 2 J/m2 of UV, with a steep slope of D(O) (mean lethal dose) = 0.95 J/m2. At much higher doses it decreased more slowly, with D(O) = 3.5 J/m2. To elucidate the cause of this unique survival response, we isolated a large number of independent clones from single colonies and measured their responses to UV. Of 81 clones analyzed, ten showed a marked resistance to killing by UV, which was only slightly more sensitive than normal cells, and these clones had a rate of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) that was about 45% of normal cells. By contrast, the remaining 71 clones were extremely sensitive to UV, typical of XP group A strains, and had a UDS level 1%-3% of normals. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism using seven polymorphic DNA probes indicated that the UV-resistant clones were derived from the same individual as the UV-sensitive clones. These results clearly demonstrate that this patient's fibroblast cells consist of two types with differing responses to UV, and provide direct evidence of somatic mosaicism for DNA repair capacity in an XP patient.\r"

Membrane-coating granules contain a battery of hydrolytic enzymes, in addition to their lamellar discs, and are therefore commonly assumed to be lamellate lysosomes. Although there are data confirming the existence of enzymes in membrane-coating granules, there is no direct evidence to suggest that their internal pH is acidic. As part of a wider program on their role in desquamation, our aim was to determine whether membrane-coating granules are indeed acidic and possess proton pumps. Chloroquine and monensin were selected as the pH markers because both induce swelling of acidic organelles. In four repeat experiments dermatome slices of pig ear skin (2 mm2 x 0.5 mm) were incubated as organ cultures either alone (control) or with 1 mM chloroquine or 25 microM monensin. Ultrastructural observations revealed no swelling in control specimens. In contrast, the inclusion of chloroquine or monensin caused swelling of specific organelles including membrane-coating granules, lysosomes, and trans elements of Golgi stacks, but not mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, or nuclear envelopes. Swelling of membrane-coating granules and the other organelles was prevented by pretreatment with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a known inhibitor of lysosomal H+ ATPase activity. These findings suggest that membrane-coating granules actively maintain an acidic interior with the aid of proton pumps. Furthermore, membrane-coating granules are heterogeneous because swelling of the whole population did not commence simultaneously. However, it remains to be determined whether this heterogeneity reflects variations in membrane-coating granule pH, leakiness of their membranes to cations, or the number or activity of their proton pumps.\r"

The dynamic ultrastructural changes of FS IgG-induced acantholysis in mice are the subject of this study. FS IgG was injected IP into neonatal BALB/c mice. Skin and serum was studied at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post injection by immunofluorescence (IF), electron microscopy (EM), and immuno-EM. Binding of FS IgG in the intercellular spaces (ICS) of the basal cell layer was seen by IF within 1 h and was strongest at 12 h. IgG binding affected the spinous and granular cell layer by 12 h, then faded and remain localized only in the basal cell layer at 24 h. By immuno-EM, IgG binding was diffuse along the keratinocyte surface. Edema of the ICS in the basal cell layer was present at 1 h by EM. At 12 h, there was microvillous formation with intact desmosomes at the tip of the projections. Splitting of desmosomes (forming half desmosomes) and acantholysis primarily affecting the granular cell layer were most prominent between 12 and 24 h. The plaques of the half desmosomes gradually disappeared and tonofilaments retracted into the cytoplasm. Detaching keratinocytes showed vacuolization, swollen mitochondria, and internalization of intact desmosomes and half desmosomes (remnants of split desmosomes). This investigation shows that the ultrastructural changes observed in the epidermis of patients with FS can be duplicated in experimental animals by IP injection of FS IgG. Further, FS IgG may have direct effects on the assembly/disassembly of desmosomes.\r"

The identity of these eicosanoid structures was established by a variety of chromatographic and analytical techniques. Normal cultured keratinocytes did not produce lipoxygenase eicosanoids either spontaneously or when given arachidonic acid in the presence of permeabilizing concentrations of ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide. Freeze-thawing of human neonatal and adult keratinocytes resulted in a rapid release of linoleic and arachidonic acids over time. Activation of a latent 15-lipoxygenase was demonstrated by the synthesis of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, and both these products were greatly increased in amount when the corresponding fatty acid precursor was added. Eicosanoid production by cells of newborn and adult origin was indistinguishable. Rapid metabolism of exogenous 15-HETE by normal keratinocytes was observed. Measurable quantities of esterified 15-HETE were found after 1 min, but by 18-20 h all the esterified 15-HETE was degraded to the extent that 80% of the recovered radioactivity was found in water-soluble form. In contrast, when labeled or unlabeled 5-HETE was used a much larger fraction was esterified intact (30% as opposed to 10%) and at the end of 18-20 hours a substantial peak of esterified 5-HETE remained. Intact esterified [3H] HETE were recovered only in the triacylglycerol fraction. The key findings that omega-6 lipoxygenase products are generated but not esterified by membrane-damaged keratinocytes, whereas these products are esterified but not generated by normal keratinocytes, may be of importance in transcellular metabolic control.\r"

In vitro, however, most of the fibrotic cell lines studied exhibited no differences in growth potential compared with control cell lines derived from normal skin. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro behavior of fibroblasts derived from pigs with subcutaneous fibrosis induced by gamma irradiation. The cells were isolated from the scar tissue six to 20 months after irradiation. In primary cultures, the cells derived from the fibrotic lesions exhibited greater attachment efficiency and faster proliferation than those of the cells derived from the normal skin of the same animal. In long-term cultures, the differences between normal and fibrotic cells were still greater: the normal skin cells underwent 17 population doublings and then died, whereas the fibrotic cells exhibited a prolonged lifespan, and were still actively proliferating after 80 population doublings. Cell morphology and the number of chromosomes were modified throughout subcultures. These results imply that in the scar tissue active fibrotic cell proliferation continued for years after irradiation and that this activation was expressed in vitro. Therefore, in this pig fibrosis model, the data acquired in the present in vitro studies closely resemble that obtained from earlier in vivo observations.\r"

To investigate a possible role of HLA-DP (or closely associated genes) in the pathogenesis of DH as well as to confirm the previously described alterations of HLA-DR3 and HLA-DQw2 antigen frequency, we have typed 43 patients with DH for HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR antigens. All patients with DH had typical clinical and histologic features, as well as granular deposits of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence. HLA-DR3 was expressed in 41 of 43 (95%) DH patients, whereas HLA-DQw2 was expressed in all 43 (100%). The overall distribution of HLA-DP antigens in patients with DH was significantly different from that seen in all controls and in HLA-DR3 and HLA-DQw2 controls (p less than 0.02). Examination of the frequency of individual DP antigens revealed that HLA-DPw1 was increased (42% of patients with DH vs 11% of all controls and 26% of DR3 positive controls), but this increase was not statistically greater than that expected due to the disequilibrium linkage of DPw1 with DR3/DQw2. Patients with DH, however, did have a statistically significant decreased frequency of DPw2 (14% of patients vs 31% of all controls and 41% of DR3 positive controls) (pc less than 0.05). Studies of three informative families demonstrated that the DPw2 genes of the DH patients were not present on the haplotype thought to carry a DH susceptibility gene (HLA-A1, HLA-B8, HLA-DR3, HLA-DQw2). A role of HLA-DP region genes in the pathogenesis of DH is further suggested by the observation that HLA-DPw1 was expressed in 82% (9 of 11) of DH patients with IgA antibodies against dietary antigens as compared with only 33% (4 of 12) of patients without IgA antibodies. HLA-DP genes or genes closely linked to them may be important in DH either as markers of the disease haplotype or by direct involvement in its pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Human keratinocytes transport extracellular thymidine across the plasma membrane and incorporate it into DNA. Data presented here show that dipyridamole, a well-known inhibitor of facilitated diffusion of nucleosides, blocks the transport of thymidine into human keratinocytes in vitro. Dipyridamole (1.0 microM) inhibited the transport of 3H-thymidine (0.2 microM) into intracellular material by 75% and its subsequent salvage and incorporation into DNA by 48%. Dipyridamole (1 microM) did not affect the growth of keratinocytes in vitro but did potentiate the growth inhibition caused by methotrexate (MTX) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The growth of keratinocytes exposed to 0.1 microM MTX for 8 d was inhibited by 32%. However, in combination with a noninhibitory concentration of dipyridamole (1 microM), this concentration of MTX (0.01 microM) inhibited the growth of keratinocytes by 93%. Thymidine in culture medium reversed the cytotoxicity of MTX. However, in the presence of dipyridamole, thymidine in the culture medium did not reverse the action of MTX. The synergistic interaction between MTX and dipyridamole was also observed with 5-FU and dipyridamole. 5-FU (0.5 microM) inhibited cell growth by 30% but in combination with dipyridamole (1 microM), inhibited cell growth by 86%. These data are consistent with the theory that inhibiting thymidine salvage by blocking transport of extracellular thymidine potentiates the growth inhibitory action of inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in human keratinocytes. Combination chemotherapy, such as methotrexate plus dipyridamole, might be efficacious in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases of the epidermis.\r"

Catheters were changed six times at 2 week intervals. Patients tended to remain as \"blockers\", \"intermediates\" or \"non-blockers\" consistently over time. There were no significant differences in use of antibiotics, clinical manifestations of urinary infection or fever among the groups. \"Blockers\" were significantly more often colonized with Proteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii than \"non-blockers\", and significantly less often with Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, there was no evidence of interference among the organisms. \"Blockers\" excreted a significantly more alkaline urine, and lesser amounts of magnesium, urea and phosphate in their urine. Two \"blockers\" in whom Proteus sp. were eliminated by coincidental antimicrobial therapy converted to \"non-blockers\". These findings support the concept that \"blockers\" are patients who have prolonged colonization with urease producing Proteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii.\r"

Misinterpretation of the percentage change model has resulted in conflicting results regarding the value of serum creatinine as a prognostic marker in lupus nephritis. We illustrate the problem and resolve the conflict using data on 87 patients with lupus nephritis. A straightforward alternative approach to the use of percentage change as an outcome is proposed: it is not subject to the problems of interpretation noted in the percentage change model.\r"

The urbanization pattern observed for the south differed from that for other regions; the core metropolitan area had the lowest CHD death rates in the south, but the highest in the other regions. The removal of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease deaths from the CHD rates under ICD-9 resulted in decreases in CHD mortality between 1978 and 1979 with large decreases in the South and in core metropolitan areas.

Using multivariate logistic regression, results reveal that those who did not report regularly exercising or walking a mile were 1.5 times more likely to decline than those who did, controlling for reported medical conditions and demographic factors.

The responsiveness of the two methods, as reflected in the p-values associated with salbutamol and theophylline effects were comparable for three of the four dimensions of the CRQ. The data suggested possible increased responsiveness of the informed method for the emotional function dimension of the questionnaire. Changes in the informed CRQ dyspnea and fatigue dimensions showed stronger correlations with changes in spirometry, 6 minute walk distance, and rating of dyspnea after the walk test than did blind administration. Further, changes in all four CRQ dimensions showed stronger correlations with corresponding global ratings using the informed questionnaire. These results suggest that by letting study subjects see their previous responses the validity of subjective measures of health status in clinical trials can be improved.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 401 eligible patients with resected stages B and C colorectal carcinoma were randomly assigned to no-further therapy or to adjuvant treatment with either levamisole alone, 150 mg/d for 3 days every 2 weeks for 1 year, or levamisole plus fluorouracil (5-FU), 450 mg/m2/d intravenously (IV) for 5 days and beginning at 28 days, 450 mg/m2 weekly for 1 year. Levamisole plus 5-FU, and to a lesser extent levamisole alone, reduced cancer recurrence in comparison with no adjuvant therapy. These differences, after correction for imbalances in prognostic variables, were only suggestive for levamisole alone (P = .05) but quite significant for levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .003). Whereas both treatment regimens were associated with overall improvements in survival, these improvements reached borderline significance only for stage C patients treated with levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .03). Therapy was clinically tolerable with either regimen and severe toxicity was uncommon. These promising results have led to a large national intergroup confirmatory trial currently in progress.\r"

Of these, 22 patients (73%) had sensory loss; half of them complained of paresthesias. The vibration perception threshold was increased in 24 patients (80%). Auditory stimulation revealed a normal latency of the first component of the brain stem-evoked potentials Pl but an increased interpeak interval between this and Pv; reflecting a central conduction defect. Motor conduction velocity (CV) along the peroneal nerve was normal. The average sural nerve CV was decreased (P less than .01) and the sensory action potential amplitude was reduced (P less than .01). Warm perception threshold was increased in 10 patients (33%). Cortical-evoked potentials after tibial nerve stimulation had increased latencies in 29 patients (97%). The peripheral CV along the tibial nerve was slowed (P less than .01) in 19 patients, and the central conduction time from Th12 to cortex was prolonged in 15 patients (P less than .01). The changes in conduction along peripheral and central pathways after tibial nerve stimulation are compatible with a toxic effect on the sensory root ganglia causing a \"dying back\" axonal degeneration of central and peripheral nerve fibers.\r"

We report our initial experience with spondylectomy in eight patients with malignant tumors of the spine operated on over a 7-year period (1980 to 1986). Four patients had primary neoplasms of the spine, and four others had solitary metastases to the vertebrae. Following surgery, five patients underwent radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy depending on histology of the tumor. Radiographic confirmation of tumor resection was obtained on all patients. Pain relief was noted in all patients, and six patients with preoperative neurological deficits improved. There was no surgical mortality, and one patient developed wound dehiscence following surgery. Six of the eight patients are alive with a median follow-up of 36 months, and local control was achieved in six of the eight patients. These preliminary data suggest that malignant tumors of the spine can be completely resected using a staged approach. In potentially responsive tumors, systemic chemotherapy is recommended between the two operations to reduce the risk of systemic dissemination.\r"

Patients with high preoperative performance status (P = .29), total resection by postoperative CT scan (P = .15), and frontal lobe tumors (P = .17) tended to survive longer following reoperation. The size of the tumor at the time of recurrence did not correlate with survival following reoperation.

All patients had a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Of the 36 patients 21 had an evaluable residual radiographic mass after completion of chemotherapy. Twelve of these patients had a less than 3 cm maximal transverse diameter residual mass, and nine had a greater than 3 cm persistent mass postchemotherapy. Only three of these 21 patients underwent postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, and the histopathology revealed only necrotic fibrous tissue. The remaining patients were followed by close observation including repeat abdominal computed tomography (CT) every 3 months the first year and every 6 months the second year (or until normal); further therapeutic intervention was given only on evidence of progressive disease. Nineteen of these 21 patients have no evidence of disease, including eight of nine with greater than 3 cm persistent radiographic abnormality. The optimal management for advanced seminoma patients with a persistent radiographic mass postchemotherapy remains unresolved. However, based on this small series, we feel that observation is a viable option, reserving radiotherapy or chemotherapy for those patients who subsequently develop progressive disease.\r"

  ".W": "Based on remarkable activity in refractory lymphomas, a combination of etoposide, cisplatin (both administered by 4-day continuous infusions), cytarabine (Ara-C), and dexamethasone (EDAP) was evaluated in 20 patients with advanced myeloma refractory to standard melphalan and prednisone (MP) and/or vincristine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and dexamethasone (VAD) and even to high doses of melphalan (HDM) (seven patients). Forty percent of patients responded regardless of previously recognized risk factors (eg, duration of drug resistance, tumor mass, and serum lactic dehydrogenase [LDH] level). While the median survival was only 4.5 months, patients with good performance (Zubrod less than 2) and low or intermediate tumor stage survived more than 14 months compared with only 2 months for the remaining group. EDAP could be readily administered in the outpatient clinic, but neutropenic fever prompted hospital admission in 80% of patients, half of whom developed penumonia and sepsis, a fatal outcome in four patients. Severe myelosuppression was of short duration, so that subsequent cycles could be administered every 3 to 4 weeks. No serious extramedullary toxicity, including renal toxicity, was encountered. Marrow toxicity and hence infectious complications may be reduced by elimination of Ara-C without compromising treatment efficacy. We conclude that the lack of cross-resistance with VAD and even HDM makes EDAP or a similar combination an attractive regiment to be formally explored in an alternating sequence with VAD in high-risk myeloma.\r"

  ".W": "Methotrexate (MTX) and mercaptopurine (MP) are the mainstays of continuation therapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). These drugs are stored in tissues as active metabolites. Relapse in ALL might reflect failure to achieve adequate intracellular drug levels. Assured (parenteral) delivery of higher doses of MTX and MP should maximize tissue levels of these drugs by overcoming individual variations in absorption, metabolism, clearance, and compliance. Fifty-nine children with ALL at lower risk of relapse received 12 intensive MTX/MP courses immediately after 4 weeks of standard vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase induction. Each 2-week intensive course included: MTX, 200 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) push then 800 mg/m2 IV over 24 hours on day 1; MP, 200 mg/m2 IV push then 800 mg/m2 IV over 8 hours on day 2; MTX, 20 mg/m2 intramuscularly on day 8; and MP, 50 mg/m2 orally daily on days 8 to 14. After the 6 months of intensive therapy, continuation therapy was weekly MTX/MP (as on days 8 to 14) for 1 or 2 years. Age-based MTX was given intrathecally (IT) for CNS prophylaxis. All patients entered remission. Three patients relapsed: bone marrow (at 24 and 37 months), and bone marrow and CNS (at 34 months). There were no isolated CNS relapses or deaths in remission. Event-free survival at 4 years is 94% (SE, 7%) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Toxicities (infection, mucositis) occurred in less than 10% of intensive MTX/MP courses. However, a child with Down's syndrome withdrew after three courses because of recurrent severe mucositis. Further studies of this regimen are in progress.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the medical records of 110 consecutive patients at our institution who had acute leukemia and received high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C; HDAC) in order to analyze risk factors associated with HDAC neurotoxicity (NT). There were adequate records on 101 patients who received 147 courses of HDAC. Twenty-six treatment courses (18%) were complicated by NT. The median time of NT onset was 5 days (range, 1 to 10 days), and NT was reversible in 16 of 21 survivors (76%). Patients with severe NT (grades 3 to 4) were less likely to have complete reversal of their neurological deficit than those with mild NT (P less than .1). In our patients, there was no significant association between previously described risk factors (age over 49 years, male gender, CNS disorder, and cumulative HDAC dose greater than 48 g/m2) and incidence of NT. However, treatment courses involving HDAC given during renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or an increase in serum creatinine greater than 0.5 mg/dL) were much more likely to be complicated by any degree of NT during administration of HDAC (62%) and severe NT (42%) than those given during normal renal function (8% and 3%, respectively; P less than .001). Of the treatment courses involving patients with estimated creatinine clearances less than 60 mL/min, 76% were complicated by NT compared with 8% of treatment courses involving patients with clearances greater than 60 mL/min (P less than .001). HDAC courses with neurotoxic patients had higher serum creatinines (2.1 +/- 1.4 v 1.1 +/- 0.6 mg/dL), greater increases in serum creatinine (+ 0.5 +/- 0.8 v + 0.07 +/- 0.3 mg/dL), and lower estimated creatinine clearances (61 +/- 35 v 91 +/- 29 mL/min) than those courses with nonneurotoxic patients (P less than .001, all parameters). Patients receiving HDAC during renal insufficiency are at high risk for developing NT. Dose reduction of HDAC should be considered for patients with renal insufficiency.\r"

Good management practice requires that nursing staff turnover be closely and routinely monitored with indices reporting both personnel numbers and staff experience status. The author describes an approach to the prevention of dysfunctional turnover levels by the establishment of retention objectives funded in the hospital budget.\r"

The purpose of this preliminary workshop was to discuss whether or not changes should be made in the formulation of the AIN-76 rodent diet. The following are highlights of some of the recommendations made by various expert committees, but they do not constitute a new formulation of the rodent diet: 1) fat should comprise no less than 10% by weight of the diet, and the fatty acid content should be standardized; 2) there should be some standardization of the source of cellulose fiber, and the amorphous form is better than the crystalline form; 3) the level of dietary vitamin E should be raised by 50% if the dietary fat content is increased to 10%; 4) one suggested alternative to decrease the incidence of nephrocalcinosis in rats consuming the AIN-76 diet for long periods is to decrease the calcium phosphate dibasic content to 400 g/kg mineral mixture; and 5) the level of manganese should be decreased to 10 mg/kg diet.\r"

  ".W": "Protein digestion and absorption were measured in weanling pigs (5 wk of age) using a total digesta collection procedure. In the first experiment, the objective was to measure the fate of nitrogenous digesta as it passed from the stomach to the terminal ileum when pigs were either allowed ad libitum access to feed or were fed four equal meals per day. Pigs were fed a standard corn-soybean meal diet in this experiment. There were no differences in flow rate or retention time of dry matter or nitrogen, and no differences in apparent nitrogen digestibility between the two feeding regimens. More than 80% of the soluble protein in the stomach and 65% in the small intestine was between 2,000 and 15,000 molecular weight. The molecular weight profiles of the soluble proteins were relatively constant throughout the small intestine, indicating that the products of protein hydrolysis were absorbed rapidly. The objective of the second experiment was to compare protein digestion and absorption in pigs fed a corn-soybean meal diet with those fed a protein-free diet. The molecular weight profiles of soluble protein were similar for the two groups of pigs. The data indicate that most of the endogenous enzymes were hydrolyzed rapidly, since little soluble protein corresponding to the molecular weight of pancreatic enzymes was detected.\r"

In addition, certain fibers may delay the digestion and absorption of fat. In the present study, the interaction of bile acids with guar gum (GG), konjac mannan (KM) and chitosan (CH) was determined. Rats were fed during a 20-min period a test meal containing either 5% cellulose (CE), GG, KM or CH and also containing 14C-labeled triolein and 3H-labeled cholesterol. The group fed CE served as control, since CE does not bind bile acids or phospholipids in vivo. Two hours after presentation of the test meal, rats were killed and the stomach and small and large intestine removed. All four groups ate the same amount of the test meal, about 1.9 g. The aqueous phase of the small intestinal contents was separated by ultracentrifugation, and the amount (mumol) of bile acids and phospholipids in the total intestinal contents and in the aqueous phase was estimated. The ratio of bile acids in the aqueous phase to that in total intestinal contents was significantly higher in the GG and KM groups and significantly lower in the CH group than that in the CE group, demonstrating that the bile acids are bound or trapped by each of these fiber sources. Only CH appeared to bind phospholipids, reducing the proportion in the aqueous phase compared to that in the CE group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This daily consumption of up to 150 mg of ascorbic acid did not impair growth, but did result in significantly higher concentrations of ascorbic acid in plasma, liver, adrenal glands and feces. When rats were fed diets deficient or marginally deficient in vitamin B-12, liver concentrations of vitamin B-12 were markedly lower than in liver of rats fed adequate vitamin B-12. Ascorbic acid ingestion raised values significantly in the vitamin B-12-deficient diet group. Urinary methylmalonic acid was significantly elevated in the deficient rats. However, it was significantly reduced to more normal values by ascorbic acid in rats with both low and marginal vitamin B-12 status, as defined by dietary and liver concentrations of vitamin B-12 activity. Although coprophagy was not prevented, rats showed no increased consumption of feces with the higher ascorbic acid content. Thus, the results of this research indicate that vitamin C ingestion partially protects rats from vitamin B-12 deficiency.\r"

Poorly fermentable fibers had no significant effect on apparent B-12 status, whereas the highly fermentable fibers significantly increased urinary methylmalonic acid and depressed oxidation of [14C]propionate to 14CO2. Pectin consistently induced significantly greater effects than did xylan or guar gum. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that fermentable fibers stimulate bacterial propionate production and exaggerate certain biochemical indicators of B-12 deficiency. Since pectin had a more pronounced effect than did other fermentable fibers, the possibility that pectin may also interfere with B-12 absorption requires further study.\r"

The present study examines whether increased urinary MMA reflects lower vitamin B-12 status or occurs only because of fermentation of pectin by intestinal bacteria and increased production of propionate, a precursor of MMA. By monitoring urinary and fecal excretion of 57Co after a tracer dose of [57Co]vitamin B-12, we found the biologic half-life of vitamin B-12 to be 59 d for rats fed a fiber-free diet and only 19 d for rats fed a 5% pectin diet. Also, pectin-fed rats oxidized only 12% of a 1-mmol dose of [14C]propionate to 14CO2 in 2 h, whereas rats fed the fiber-free diet expired 33% of the dose. Finally, high urinary MMA persisted even after the removal of pectin from the diet. We conclude that dietary pectin accelerates vitamin B-12 depletion in rats, possibly by interfering with enterohepatic recycling of vitamin B-12. By stimulating microbial propionate production, pectin and other fermentable fibers may also contribute to increased urinary MMA in vitamin B-12 deficiency, but a larger propionate pool does not account for the other effects of pectin on vitamin B-12 status.\r"

Mean fetal liver (2.14 micrograms/g dry wt) and serum (21.4 ng/ml) selenium concentrations and whole blood GSH-Px activity (21.6 mu/ml) differed (P less than 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.01, respectively) from corresponding maternal values (0.95 micrograms/g liver dry wt; 44.0 ng/ml; 16.7 mu/ml, respectively), while no differences were found between whole blood or erythrocyte selenium concentrations. Fetal liver selenium concentration was greater than corresponding maternal liver selenium in 99% (96/97) of the dam-fetal pairs, suggesting efficient placental transfer and fetal concentrating ability. Maternal liver selenium concentration was most highly correlated to all fetal tissue selenium concentrations and used to develop prediction models. These data suggest that selenium efficiently passes the placenta, and based on published values of adequate adult liver selenium concentrations and maternal-fetal relationships, we suggest an adequate liver selenium concentration in the bovine fetus to be greater than 2.2 micrograms/g liver dry wt, and in whole blood, greater than 120 ng/ml.\r"

An in vitro, in situ double-perfusion technique was used in which the intestinal vasculature, from the superior mesenteric artery to the portal vein, and the intestinal lumen, from the duodenum to the ileum, were perfused simultaneously. The vasculature was perfused with a synthetic \"plasma\" (vascular perfusate) while the lumen was perfused with a nutrient-rich solution (intestinal perfusate) at concentrations of trivalent Cr of 0.2-20 mumol/l (10-1000 ppb). Dose-response curves, in which Cr transport, retention and uptake were plotted against the luminal Cr concentration, revealed that Cr absorption is a nonsaturable process. Regardless of the Cr concentration of the intestinal perfusate, 5.90 +/- 0.33% (mean +/- SEM) of the test dose was taken up from the meal, 5.52 +/- 0.33% was transported into the vascular perfusate and 0.38 +/- 0.03% was retained by the small intestine. Based on the criterion of saturability, it was concluded that inorganic, trivalent Cr is absorbed by the nonmediated process of passive diffusion in the small intestine of rats fed a Cr-adequate diet (1.44 micrograms Cr/g diet).\r"

Stable selenium measurements were also made to determine selenium intake, excretion in feces and urine, and mass of selenium in tissues. Immediately following tracer injection, there was a rapid disappearance of radioactivity from plasma reflecting the uptake of the element by the liver and blood cells. The decrease in plasma radioactivity ceased abruptly by 30-45 min, and was followed by an increase to a peak by 3-4 h and a more gradual biphasic decline thereafter. A kinetic model of selenium metabolism in the whole animal was constructed employing the SAAM/CONSAM computer program. The multiphasic response of plasma radioactivity during a physiological steady state was explained on the basis of rapid hepatic uptake of selenium and its subsequent reappearance in the circulation in protein-bound form followed by further metabolism and excretion of the element. The model provides reference parameter values for 75Se-sodium selenite kinetics in selenium-replete, mature nonpregnant ewes for comparison with the kinetics in animals whose selenium status may be altered.\r"

Gestational age had no effect on maternal vitamin E concentration, however, fetal tissue alpha-tocopherol concentration declined (P less than 0.05) with fetal age. Maternal serum alpha-tocopherol concentration and fetal age were found to best predict fetal alpha-tocopherol concentration in serum. Interrelationships between selenium and vitamin E status were minimal.

Groups of mature female rats were fed a purified diet either deficient (less than 0.5 micrograms/g) or sufficient (6.2 micrograms/g) in copper for 6 wk. Copper deficiency resulted in distinct ultrastructural changes in acinar cells, including marked variability in zymogen granule content, autophagic vacuoles and dilation of acinar lumen. Pancreatic weight and total DNA, RNA and protein content of the pancreas were similar in both groups of rats, whereas pancreatic amylase, trypsin and chymotrypsin activity was significantly lower in the copper-deficient group. In addition, secretagogue-induced release of these enzymes from dispersed acini isolated from copper-deficient rats was significantly reduced in comparison to enzyme secretion from normal controls. Pancreatic Cu-Zn and Mn superoxide dismutase activity was also found to be significantly lower in the copper-deficient rats than in normal controls. We conclude that nutritional copper deficiency in adult female rats reduces the responsiveness of the pancreas to secretagogues and may increase the susceptibility of the pancreas to oxidative damage.\r"

Among Mg-deficient groups, starch-fed rats had the highest level of plasma Mg, while fructose-fed rats had the highest level of kidney Mg.

This was especially evident in the Ca content of the kidney, which was 8- to 9-fold greater than that of all other experimental groups.

There has been disagreement even on the basal levels of carbamoyl phosphate. In this report we show, using an improved assay, that the hepatic level of carbamoyl phosphate is very low (less than 1.3 nmol/g) in the fasted mouse or after a meal containing a mixture of amino acids including arginine, and that it increases dramatically (up to 180 nmol/g liver) after a meal without arginine. We estimated a fast turnover for carbamoyl phosphate, and we found a marked correlation between liver carbamoyl phosphate and urinary orotate, and also between urinary orotate and intake of an arginine-free diet. These results support the hypothesis that accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate in liver mitochondria, its efflux from this organelle and its utilization by the cytosolic pyrimidine pathway cause the orotic aciduria of arginine deprivation. We assayed liver acetylglutamate (the activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis) and several intermediates of the urea cycle and found that low levels of ornithine partly explain the accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate during arginine deprivation. However, acetylglutamate and citrulline were increased, and the potential significance of these changes is discussed.\r"

Vitamin B-12 deficiency is associated with decreased L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity, and consequent accumulation of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. The formation of propionylcarnitine from propionyl-CoA and carnitine provides an alternative pathway to remove propionyl-CoA from cells. Hepatocytes isolated from vitamin B-12--deficient rats metabolized propionate (1 mM) to CO2 and glucose at only 23% and 12%, respectively, of the rates observed in hepatocytes from control animals. In contrast, no difference was seen in rates of pyruvate metabolism by hepatocytes from control and vitamin B-12--deficient rats. Addition of carnitine (10 mM) to hepatocyte incubations increased the rate of propionylcarnitine formation 10- to 20-fold without altering conversion of propionate to CO2 or glucose. The rate of propionylcarnitine formation was not affected by vitamin B-12 deficiency. When carnitine (10 mM) was added, propionylcarnitine generation represented 65-71% of total propionate utilization in hepatocytes isolated from vitamin B-12--deficient rats. Gluconeogenesis from [1-14C]pyruvate was inhibited by 1 mM propionate in hepatocytes from vitamin B-12--deficient rats. No effect of 1 mM propionate on glucose formation from pyruvate was seen using hepatocytes from control rats. Intraperitoneal administration of L-carnitine resulted in a significant increase in urinary propionylcarnitine excretion from vitamin B-12--deficient rats, but not from control animals. The results demonstrate that exogenous carnitine can significantly enhance propionyl-group utilization via the formation of acylcarnitines under the conditions of impaired acyl-CoA metabolism associated with vitamin B-12 deficiency.\r"

By d 2, liver cytosolic BCAA aminotransferase activity had increased in rats fed 50% casein; by d 9, activity had increased in rats fed 0 or 5% casein as well. Liver mitochondrial BCAA aminotransferase activity was unresponsive to dietary treatment. Basal liver BCKA dehydrogenase activity and the percent active complex were proportional to protein intake on d 2 and 6. On d 2, total BCKA dehydrogenase activity was the same in all groups; by d 6, total activity had increased in rats fed 30 or 50% casein. We conclude that although the adaptive changes in BCAA-degrading enzyme activities are small, they are sufficient to compensate for excessively high or low protein intakes, so that tolerable concentrations of BCAA and BCKA are maintained.\r"

Beginning at 3 wk of age, eight broiler chickens were given a daily injection of either bicarbonate buffer (control), 100 or 200 micrograms ncGH/kg body wt, or 200 micrograms rcGH/kg body wt for 14 d. Blood samples were taken preinjection and 4 h postinjection on d 7 and 14 of chicken growth hormone (GH) treatment. Compared to preinjection levels, plasma GH levels at 4 h postinjection were significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated by daily injection (per kg body wt) of 100 micrograms ncGH (2.3-fold), 200 micrograms ncGH (5.5-fold) or 200 micrograms rcGH (6.4-fold). Although exogenous chicken GH treatment failed to increase body weight gain, ncGH injections did increase (P less than 0.05) body fat content to 117% that of the control group. Daily injection of chicken GH did not alter plasma levels of immunoreactive insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), thyroid hormones, insulin, glucagon or glucose. Feed efficiency, heat production rate and respiratory quotient were also not affected by chicken GH treatment. Plasma levels of nonesterified fatty acids were elevated (P less than 0.05) by treatment with 200 micrograms ncGH/kg body wt. In contrast to domestic mammals, it is apparent that exogenous chicken GH can not be used to increase lean body mass or improve productive efficiency in chickens. Our results indicate that exogenous chicken GH exerts a strong lipogenic, rather than lipolytic, action in rapidly growing broiler cockerels.\r"

Tests with the 1,1 dimethylheptyl (DMH) homolog of (-)- delta 8-THC as well as its 11-hydroxylated (11-OH) derivative [(-)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH], showed that both compounds were more potent than the training compound, especially so in the case of the 11-OH product (66 and 80 times more potent than delta 9-THC in rats and pigeons, respectively). The enantiomer, (+)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH, was inactive as a THC-like psychotomimetic in doses even up to 10 mg/kg [ED50 of (-)-11-OH-delta 8-THC being 0.01 mg/kg and 0.002 mg/kg in rats and pigeons, respectively]. Hence, the typical THC-like effects in rats and pigeons (and by extrapolation possibly also the feeling of \"high\" in humans), reside exclusively in the levo [(-)]-enantiomers of THC-type cannabinoids (at least in the pair studied by us) as demonstrated clearly in this study. Both (-)-delta 8-THC-DMH and (-)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH had a slow onset and a long duration of action.\r"

In two studies the mice were made leukopenic by whole-body irradiation. Four absorption studies were also performed in parallel. In Streptococcus pneumoniae peritonitis, the protective dose 50% (PD50) value of EA and ES, given s.c., did not differ from each other. The bioavailability of EA was slightly inferior to that of ES. In three other peritonitis studies (2 Staphylococci and 1 Streptococcus), where the treatments were given s.c., EA seemed to lag behind ES in efficacy. The parallel absorption experiment showed, however, that, as compared to ES, only about one-half of EA was released from the s.c. injection site to the blood. The adjusted PD50 values of both erythromycins were about the same, with one exception. When the treatments were given i.p. both erythromycins were equally effective, and the difference in bioavailability was minor. On the contrary, the efficacy of 2'-ethylsuccinyl erythromycin was only about one-tenth that of the other erythromycins as was also the bioavailability. Oral treatment gave similar therapeutic results with EA and ES, with similar bioavailabilities, too. In the muscle abscess model, single s.c. injections of EA and ES were equally effective in reducing the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. These results suggest that there is no great difference in the in vivo antibacterial performance of ES and its 2'-acetyl ester, although the absorption problems complicate the interpretation. Hence EA performs better than expected if only the hydrolyzed drug were useful.\r"

However, little is known of the degree of hypoxia required to produce inhibition of drug elimination by oxidative pathways in the intact organ. This study, in the isolated perfused rat liver, examined the oxygen dependence of the hepatic elimination of omeprazole, a drug which undergoes extensive oxidative metabolism in the rat. The relationship between hepatic oxygen supply and the production of omeprazole's oxidative sulfone and reductive sulfide metabolites was also examined. Rat livers were perfused at 15 ml/min with a perfusate containing 5 micrograms/ml of omeprazole in a single-pass design. Omeprazole clearance and the formation clearance of the two metabolites were measured in each liver during normal oxygenation, at different levels of hypoxia and after reoxygenation. There was a linear relationship between omeprazole clearance and oxygen delivery over the whole range studied. Production of the sulfone was similarly oxygen-dependent whereas the sulfide was only detectable after a significant reduction in oxygenation. In a further group of experiments the oxygen dependence of omeprazole clearance was shown to not be altered when the concentration of drug was lowered to 1 microgram/ml. This study shows that oxygen delivery is a critical determinant of the rate of oxidative drug metabolism in the isolated liver and supports the contention that reductions in hepatic oxygen supply may significantly alter the hepatic disposition of oxidatively metabolized drugs in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Various kinetic models have been developed to describe the elimination of substances by the liver, but there is no agreement about which model is the most appropriate, as experimental evaluation is incomplete and results conflict. We have shown previously that hepatic elimination of taurocholate is best described by models that embody a high degree of sinusoidal heterogeneity or mixing, whereas another study showed that elimination of diazepam is best described by models that embody a low degree of sinusoidal heterogeneity or mixing. To investigate this discrepancy we examined, in the isolated perfused rat liver, the simultaneous elimination of taurocholate and diazepam. The effect on hepatic availability of varying unbound fraction (fu) in a single pass, steady-state system was studied in six experiments for taurocholate (fu, 0.066-0.966) and diazepam (fu, 0.051-0.675) by varying perfusate albumin concentration (0-60 g l-1). As before, elimination of taurocholate was best described by models that embody a high degree of sinusoidal heterogeneity or mixing (i.e., venous equilibrium model, dispersion model with dispersion number = infinity). Diazepam elimination was best described by models that embody a low degree of sinusoidal heterogeneity or mixing (undistributed sinusoidal model, dispersion model with low dispersion number = 1.04). A third model, a distributed model incorporating heterogeneity of sinusoidal blood flows and intrinsic clearances, fitted the data for both taurocholate and diazepam. The fitted coefficients of variation of both flow and intrinsic clearance among the sinusoids were large for taurocholate (176 and 164, respectively), but for diazepam blood flow was large (200) whereas that for intrinsic clearance was small (0.807).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relative proportion of antilipolytic alpha-2 and lipolytic beta adrenoceptors and the adrenoceptors was studied in adipocytes from lean and obese dogs. The modification of the adrenergic status in the adipose tissue from obese dogs consists of an increase in alpha-2 adrenoceptor number (identified by [3H]yohimbine) and a decrease in beta adrenoceptor number (identified by [3H]dihydroalprenolol). Neither the number of beta adrenoceptors in the leukocytes nor the number of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the platelets were altered in obesity. This predominance of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in adipocytes from obese dogs induced a reduction of the lipolytic efficacy of epinephrine (i.e., increase in the concentration able to induce half-maximal stimulation of lipolysis). Moreover, the number of beta adrenoceptors in the high-affinity state was increased in adipose tissue from obese dogs. It is concluded first that the striking modifications in the adrenergic status of the adipose tissue in obesity is specific to this tissue and secondly that the rise of the beta adrenoceptor in the high-affinity state could explain the fact that catecholamines remain lipolytic agents and that weight loss is increased by starvation in the obese dog.\r"

Diltiazem (greater than or equal to 10 microM) but not TA3090 (less than or equal to 100 microM) depolarized the membrane of the rabbit mesenteric artery. TA3090 (greater than or equal to 3 microM) inhibited the action potential and K-induced contraction (128 mM) more than diltiazem (IC50 for action potential, 6.7 microM for TA3090 and 11 microM for diltiazem in the presence of 5 mM tetraethylammonium; IC50 for phasic and tonic K-induced contractions, 3.1 and 0.1 microM, respectively, for TA3090 and 10 and 1 microM for diltiazem). When the membrane was depolarized previously by high concentrations of K in Ca-free solution, TA3090 more potently inhibited the K-induced contraction (128 mM). As a consequence, the concentration-response curve shifted to the left, suggesting that this agent produces voltage-dependent inhibition. Recovery of the amplitudes of action potential and contraction evoked by 128 mM K required a much longer period with TA3090 than diltiazem after removal of these agents and the recovery of the K-induced contraction was also voltage-dependent. Repetitive application of short stimulating pulses (50 musec, 30 Hz) produced an action potential on the excitatory junction potentials. TA3090 inhibited the action potential without change in the amplitude of excitatory junction potentials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Morphine (300 and 1000 micrograms/kg i.v.) did not affect vagal bradycardia. The inhibitory effect of leu-enkephalin (30 micrograms/kg) and pentazocine (300 micrograms/kg) was effectively antagonized by naloxone (1000 micrograms/kg i.v.). Bradycardic response to intracoronary injection of methacholine (0.1, 0.3 and 1 microgram) into the right coronary artery was unaffected by leu-enkephalin (30 micrograms/kg). On the other hand, leu-enkephalin and pentazocine did not modify tachycardic response to sympathetic nerve stimulation (1-8 Hz). Morphine attenuated sympathetic tachycardia only slightly. These results suggest that presynaptic opioid receptors, probably delta type, are present in the vagus nerves, and that the activation of opioid receptors inhibit vagal transmission to the dog heart. In contrast, the presence of opioid receptors in the cardiac sympathetic nerves is not evident.\r"

The penetration of Gd-DTPA into hepatic cells was reflected by a 41% reduction in the longitudinal relaxation time of the beta phosphorus atom of intrahepatic ATP used as an index of the contrast agent presence. The perfusion of free Gd-DTPA did not affect the relaxation index nor did liposomes devoid of paramagnetic agent. There was no indication of interference of Gd-DTPA, free or encapsulated in liposomes, with liver energetic metabolism. Alterations of hepatic magnetic resonance imaging signal induced by Gd-DTPA containing liposomes might help to assess the functional state of the parenchyma and pinpoint the intracellular compartment as opposed to the intravascular space.\r"

The Kd for [3H] rauwolscine binding was similar for all these blood vessels, but the maximum number of [3H]rauwolscine binding sites was 3 to 7 times higher in veins compared to arteries. The Kd for [3H] prazosin was higher in saphenous vein than that in the arteries. The maximum number of binding sites for [3H]prazosin was similar, except for that in aorta, which was 3 times greater. Phenylephrine (alpha-1 adrenoceptor selective agonist) or norepinephrine (nonselective adrenoceptor agonist) produced similar maximal responses in all vessels.

Contractile responses of mesenteric artery were unaffected by rauwolscine. Rauwolscine (10(-7) M) caused a greater parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curve to norepinephrine than did prazosin (10(-7) M) in saphenous veins, and a further rightward shift of responses to norepinephrine after 10(-7) M prazosin in mesenteric vein and saphenous vein and abolished B-HT 920-induced responses at alpha-2 adrenoceptors. The tissues responding to B-HT-920 correspond to those having the highest alpha-2 receptor density as measured by [3H]rauwolscine binding.

The cytotoxicity by Glu (1 and 10mM) was potentiated by exposure to growth medium containing a low concentration of cystine (5-100 microM), instead of the normal medium containing 200 microM cystine. In contrast, the toxicity was suppressed by increasing the cystine concentration to 500 to 1000 microM. Reducing agents, cysteine (30-1000 microM), dithiothreitol (10-250 microM) and glutathione (GSH, 10-1000 microM) also protected the cells against the cytotoxicity of 10 mM Glu in a concentration-dependent manner. The antioxidants vitamin E (10-100 microM), idebenone (0.1-3 microM) and vinpocetine (10-100 microM) also provided marked protection against the cytotoxicity of Glu (10 mM) or quisqualate (1 mM). Antioxidants also prevented the delayed cell death caused by lowering the concentration of cystine in the medium to 5 microM. Incubation of the cells with 10 mM Glu caused a marked decrease in cellular GSH levels. Although cysteine and dithiothreitol prevented the GSH reduction caused by Glu, antioxidants did not. The cellular levels of oxidants were assessed using 2,7-dichlorofluorescin, a probe that accumulates within cells and is converted to a fluorescent product by oxidation. Glu (10 mM) caused a marked increase in such fluorescence, whereas vitamin E and idebenone reduced markedly the number of fluorescent cells to control levels even added with 10 mM Glu. These results indicate that oxidative stress due to loss of cellular levels of GSH is one mechanism whereby Glu/quisqualate exert cytotoxicity and suggest that centrally active antioxidants may reduce neuronal damage in pathologic conditions associated with excessive Glu release.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that propranolol can lower arterial pressure through an action within the central nervous system. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether the hydrophilic beta blocking drug atenolol which is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity can reduce arterial pressure through a central action and 2) whether this action is stereoselective for the (-)-, or beta receptor blocking enantiomer. Studies were conducted in the anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats in which the cardiovascular effects of (-)- and (+)- atenolol were compared after i.v. or intracisternal administration. Intravenous injection of 100 micrograms/kg of (-)-atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure 25 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than .02) and lowered heart rate 58 +/- 7 bpm (P less than .02). The same dose of (+)-atenolol i.v. produced no significant changes in either mean arterial pressure or heart rate. Similarly, intracisternal (-)-atenolol, 66 micrograms/kg, significantly (P less than .05) reduced mean arterial pressure and heart rate whereas the same dose of the (+)-isomer was without effect. When the i.v. dose of (-)-atenolol was lowered to 33 micrograms/kg, heart rate was decreased markedly but mean arterial pressure was not reduced. In contrast, 33 micrograms/kg of intracisternal (-)- atenolol significantly reduced mean arterial pressure 17 +/- 6 mm Hg and reduced heart rate. These results suggest that atenolol possesses a central hypotensive action that is selective for the (-)-, beta receptor blocking enantiomer.\r"

  ".W": "In the isolated rat kidney, the vasoconstrictor response elicited by periarterial nerve stimulation at low frequencies (2 Hz) is resistant to alpha adrenergic receptor blockade. It has been proposed that in some blood vessels ATP is coreleased with norepinephrine during nerve stimulation to activate P2-purinergic receptors and is responsible for the component of the vasoconstrictor response that is resistant to alpha adrenergic receptor blockade. To assess the contribution of a purinergic transmitter in the vasoconstriction elicited by periarterial nerve stimulation in the isolated Tyrodes-perfused rat kidney, fractional overflow of [3H]norepinephrine and vasoconstrictor responses to renal nerve stimulation were examined after alpha adrenergic receptor blockade and/or P2-purinergic receptor desensitization. The alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists prazosin (0.1-1.0 microM) and corynanthine (0.1-1.0 microM) and the nonselective alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine (0.1-1.0 microM) did not significantly reduce vasoconstrictor responses elicited by low frequency (0.5-4 Hz) but attenuated the responses to high-frequency (6-10 Hz) periarterial nerve stimulation. At low-frequency renal nerve stimulation, selective P2-purinergic receptor desensitization abolished the vasoconstriction at 0.5 Hz and dramatically attenuated the responses up to 4 Hz. In the presence of prazosin, the component of the vasoconstrictor response that was resistant to alpha adrenergic receptor blockade at all frequencies of renal nerve stimulation was abolished after treatment with alpha, beta-methylene ATP. On the other hand, in the isolated perfused rabbit kidney, prazosin (1.0 microM) alone reduced dramatically the vasoconstrictor responses to periarterial nerve stimulation over the same frequencies used in the rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Diuretic resistance to furosemide in the nephrotic syndrome (NS) may result from binding of drug to filtered albumin within the renal tubule. In buffer solutions intended to partially mimic the luminal environment of the distal nephron during the NS, we examined several chemical properties to determine their effect on furosemide-albumin binding equilibria. Dissociation constants were obtained by measuring furosemide's quenching of human serum albumin's intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence over ranges of pH, ionic strength (IS) and osmolarity. Neither pH nor osmolarity significantly affected binding; however, incremental increases in IS between 0.0 and 1.0 produced increases in Kd from 0.65 +/- 0.05 to 34.38 +/- 1.72 microM, resulting in a 5- and 28-fold increase in the unbound furosemide fraction when the furosemide-albumin concentrations were 3.0:5.0 and 10.0:45.0 microM, respectively. Our results indicate that human serum albumin contains one high affinity binding site for furosemide that is sensitive to IS. Because of changes in the concentrations of reactants as well as IS that can occur in nephron segments distal to furosemide's site of action, we conclude that the amount of unbound (i.e., pharmacologically active) drug in voided urine will not necessarily correspond to the amount at the active site. To clinically assess the pharmacodynamic consequence of protein binding in the NS, changes in the concentration of the reactants and IS in the distal nephron must be minimized so that the unbound furosemide measured in voided urine will accurately reflect the amount at the drug's active site.\r"

Rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate intragastrically administered AMPH or PB from saline using a signaled shock-avoidance trial procedure. In AMPH-trained pigeons the histamine H1-antagonists tripelennamine, diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine consistently produced greater than 80% AMPH-appropriate responding. Pyrilamine substituted for AMPH in two of three pigeons. In contrast, chlorcyclizine, hydroxyzine, promethazine and the histamine H2-antagonist cimetidine all failed to produce AMPH-appropriate responding. None of the histamine H1-antagonists tested substituted for PB in PB-trained pigeons. In AMPH-trained monkeys, only tripelennamine completely substituted for AMPH. Whereas chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine and pyrilamine did not produce AMPH-appropriate responding in monkeys, these compounds did produce observable excitation and convulsions. As with the PB-trained pigeons, none of the histamine H1-antagonists tested substituted for PB in monkeys. The results of the present study demonstrate that histamine H1-antagonists have differential discriminative stimulus properties in both pigeons and monkeys. Specifically, histamine H1-antagonists known to produce more central nervous system stimulation in humans share discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH and/or produce observable signs of stimulation in monkeys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of drugs that bind selectively to different serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes were assessed in pigeons. Keypecking was maintained by a multiple fixed-ratio schedule of reinforcement in which responding also was punished during one component. The greatest increases in punished responding were produced by the buspirone analogs BMY 7378 and ipsapirone, which act at the 5-HT1A receptor. RU 24969, with high affinity for both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, and 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine, a 5-HT1 compound, increased punished responding to a lesser extent, as did the 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin and ritanserin. The 5-HT3 antagonists GR 38032F, ICS 205930 and MDL 72222 showed little systematic effect, and the mixed 5-HT1B/5-HT1C compound 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine produced only decreases in punished responding. Levels of neurotransmitter metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid were assessed across a wide dose range of representative drugs used in the behavioral studies. Levels of the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were decreased significantly by BMY 7378 and ipsapirone, were not changed by ritanserin and were increased at one dose by MDL 72222. The results are consistent with suggestions that decreased 5-HT neurotransmission is involved in the effects of novel nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics such as buspirone. Behavioral and neurochemical data also indicate that the effects of these drugs on other neurotransmitter systems do not play a significant role in their anxiolytic actions.\r"

The peptide levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. The concentrations of the striatal levels of dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine and their acid metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. An acute administration of cocaine (20 or 30 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect the peptide levels in the striatum or in the substantia nigra. A regimen of subchronic administration of cocaine (20 mg/kg/day for 4 days) increased the striatonigral DYN levels, without altering the levels of Met5-enkephalin or substance P. The increase in DYN levels were persistent for at least 4 days after the last dose of the subchronic administration of cocaine. The DYN levels returned to control values by 12 days after the last dose. The DA levels in the striatum were increased 30 min after a single dose of cocaine. None of the other treatments elicited any changes in DA or 5-hydroxytryptamine or their metabolites. The subchronic cocaine administration to dopaminergic denervated rats with 6-hydroxydopamine failed to evoke any increase in DYN levels in the striatum or substantia nigra. The concurrent administration of the D1 DA antagonist, SCH-23390, or the D2 DA antagonist, spiperone, to the subchronic regimen of cocaine also blocked the cocaine-induced increase in DYN levels. These results indicate that cocaine selectively enhances the synthesis or decreases the release of DYN in the striatonigral neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "When rats are returned to an environment in which they previously received electric shock they show a reduction in sensitivity to painful stimuli. This conditional fear-induced analgesia was measured using the formalin test. The octapeptide Cys2Tyr3Orn5Pen7-amide (CTOP; 0, 10, 40 and 160 ng/rat) dose-dependently reversed conditional analgesia when administered i.c.v. The 40-ng dose partially attenuated fear-induced analgesia, whereas the 160-ng dose reversed it completely. Using similar procedures, CTOP was tested for its ability to reverse the analgesia produced by i.c.v. administered [D-Ala2,-NMPhe4, Glyol5]-enkephalin, [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]-enkephalin and U50488H, which are highly selective opioid agonists at mu, delta and kappa receptors, respectively. At 40 ng/rat, CTOP reversed the analgesia produced by the mu selective ligand but not that produced by the delta ligand or the kappa ligand. At 80 ng CTOP antagonized the analgesia produced both by both enkephalin analogs but not U50488H. Nor-binaltorphimine (0, 1, 3, 10 and 30 micrograms/rat) had no effect on conditional analgesia. However, the 10- and 30-micrograms doses could reverse completely the analgesia produced by U50488H. Therefore, it appears that mu and delta, but not kappa receptors, are involved in this opioid form of stress-induced analgesia.\r"

Saturation binding curves for [3H]PAF indicated that the PAF receptor has a dissociation constant (KD) of 28.72 nM. In comparison, PAF-stimulated PLC activity, as monitored by [3H]inositol triphosphate production, increased at lower concentrations and had an half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of 1.5 nM. Unlabeled PAF inhibited [3H]PAF binding competitively and demonstrated two binding sites, a high affinity site with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 2.65 nM and a low affinity site with a Ki of 0.80 microM. The inhibitory effects of four PAF antagonists, CV-3988, CV-6209, SRI 63-441 and SRI 63-675 on the binding of [3H]PAF were compared to the effects of the antagonists on PAF-stimulated PLC activity. The four antagonists inhibited [3H]PAF binding almost completely whereas their ability to inhibit PAF-stimulated PLC activity varied. CV-3988, SRI 63-441 and SRI 63-675 had half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.28, 0.78 and 0.42 microM, respectively, whereas CV-6209 was more potent at inhibiting [3H]PAF binding (IC50 = 7.73 nM). The SRI 63-441 and SRI 63-675 inhibited PLC totally with an IC50 value of 0.78 and 1.27 microM, respectively. The CV-3988 and CV-6209 showed a maximal PLC inhibition of about 45% with \"apparent IC50\" values of 1.05 and 0.17 microM, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

T-2 was about 300-fold more potent at inhibiting protein synthesis in CHO than was tetraol. Association of T-2 with CHO was highly specific and achieved a maximum at a concentration producing complete inhibition of protein synthesis. Association of tetraol with CHO was of low specificity, but the specific fraction did correlate with the dose-response curve for protein synthesis inhibition. Binding of both T-2 and tetraol to isolated CHO ribosomes was quantitatively similar and highly specific. With isolated ribosomes, each toxin competed effectively for the binding of the other. Using intact cells, tetraol competed for T-2 cell association, but not the converse. The kinetics at physiological temperature for total and specific T-2 cell association were much more rapid than those for tetraol. Furthermore, the rate of tetraol-cell association was indistinguishable from the rate for cellular uptake of tritiated water. At 0 degrees C, there was a substantial association of T-2 with cells, whereas none was observed with tetraol. The kinetics of dissociation of both toxins from CHO were similar. We conclude that T-2 rapidly crosses the cell membrane of cells and binds to the intracellular target, the ribosomes. In contrast, tetraol is taken up by the cell much more slowly, and many more toxin molecules are found in the cell than there are ribosomes. It would appear that the main physical property of the toxins that brings about these results is the relative hydrophobicities of the molecules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The analogs, substituted with -1-(4-carboxybenzyl) (EXP6155),-1-[4-(2-carboxybenzamido)benzyl] (EXP6159) and the 5-methylacetate of EXP6159 (EXP6803), were found to inhibit the binding of [3H]AII to AII receptors in rat adrenal cortical microsomes with 9-, 35- and 107-fold higher affinity, respectively, than that of S-8308 (IC50, 15 X 10(-6) microM). Scatchard analysis of the [3H]AII binding revealed that in the presence of EXP6155 (10(-6) M), the dissociation constant for AII was increased from 1.2 to 3.9 X 10(-9) M, whereas the total number of binding sites remained unchanged, suggesting a competitive nature of antagonism. A similar order of affinity or potency (saralasin much greater than EXP6803 greater than EXP6159 greater than EXP6155 greater than S8308) was observed in various in vitro and in vivo assays: rat smooth muscle cells AII binding, 45Ca++ influx in rat aortic rings, contractile response in isolated rabbit aorta and AII-induced pressor response in anesthetized rats. Responses (45Ca++ and contraction) elicited by norepinephrine or by KCl were unaltered by these agents at concentrations of up to 10(-4) M. In addition, they exerted no direct effect on the activity of rabbit angiotensin converting enzyme and rat renin.

Ca release was monitored by determination of changes in the extra-microsomal Ca concentration using Indo-1, a fluorescent Ca indicator. In the absence of ATP, ethanol released Ca from microsomes in a concentration-dependent manner, with a threshold for Ca release between 25 and 50 mM. Ethanol-induced release of microsomal Ca was reduced by approximately 50% after ATP-stimulated uptake of Ca, indicating that the ethanol-releasable pool was diminished by ATP-dependent uptake of Ca into an ethanol-insensitive microsomal pool. Release of Ca produced by ethanol was linear with concentration (up to 400 mM). By contrast, IP3-induced Ca release was saturable and was dependent on prior ATP-stimulated Ca uptake. Simultaneous addition of ethanol and IP3 produced additive responses. These results show that pharmacologically relevant concentrations of ethanol release Ca from an IP3-insensitive intracellular Ca store. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the existence of at least two releasable stores of Ca in brain microsomes.\r"

A critical stenosis sufficient to just abolish the hyperemic response to a 20-sec total occlusion was placed on the left circumflex coronary artery of anesthetized open chest dogs using an adjustable screw occluder clamp. Thrombi were formed by applying a 150 microA anodal current to a wire placed within the lumen of the left circumflex just proximal to the screw occluder clamp.

Both acute and chronic administration of CSA lead to renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. The present studies were designed to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in acute CSA-induced changes in renal hemodynamics. Infusion of CSA resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in perfusion pressure in isolated rat kidneys perfused at constant flow. Phenoxybenzamine blunted this response, and therefore a small component of CSA-induced renal vasoconstriction can be attributed to CSA-induced norepinephrine release from nerve terminals in this preparation. The response was antagonized profoundly, but not blocked completely, by nifedipine and methoxyverapamil, consistent with the hypothesis that a large component of CSA-induced vasoconstriction is mediated by Ca++ influx through potential-operated channels in vascular smooth muscle cells, and perhaps in nerve terminals as well. However, CSA-induced activation of such channels cannot account entirely for CSA-induced vasoconstriction because, in the presence of K-depolarization and Ca++ channel blockade, CSA still produced a small increase in renovascular resistance. This latter response was blocked entirely by quinacrine but not by meclofenamate. Neither quinacrine nor meclofenamate alone affected CSA-induced renal vasoconstriction. Therefore, products of phospholipase A2 activity, but not products of the cyclooxygenase pathway, may be involved to some small extent. In conclusion, CSA-induced increases in renovascular resistance are complex and appear to be produced not only by actions on vascular smooth muscle cells per se but also by actions on nerve terminals.\r"

Over the range of 0.3 to 1.0 nmol these agents produced a dose-dependent antinociception in the hot plate and tail-flick tests. In addition, 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine and N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine both suppressed the chemically evoked writhing response as well as the touch-evoked hyperesthesia normally observed in rats receiving low doses of intrathecal strychnine. These adenosine analogs examined at doses higher than 1.5 nmol produced a dose-dependent motor impairment as measured behaviorally and by electromyography, and an increase in the volume distention required to evoke micturition. Statistically significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure were not observed at any of the doses tested. The effects of the adenosine analogs on nociceptive and motor endpoints were partially antagonized by pretreatment with intrathecal caffeine (2 mumol). These results suggest a probable association of spinal adenosine receptors with a number of spinal sensory and motor systems other than those involved with nociceptive processing.\r"

The present studies were designed to determine if functional thromboxane A2 (TXA2)/prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) receptors exist in HEL cells. Radioligand binding assays were performed using [125I]PTA-OH, a TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist. Scatchard analysis revealed one class of binding sites for 1-PTA-OH with a Kd = 122 +/- 18 nM and maximum binding = 1.7 +/- 0.3 x 10(5) sites/cell. Competition for [125I]PTA-OH binding with the TXA2/PGH2 receptor agonists SQ26655 and U46619 revealed one class of binding sites for SQ26655 with a Kd = 17 nM and two classes of binding sites for for U46619 with a Kd = 45 nM for the high-affinity site and a Kd = 450 nM for the low-affinity site. Competition for [125I]PTA-OH by the steroisomeric TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonists L657925 and L657926 revealed two classes of binding sites for the more potent L657925 with a Kd = 8 nM for the high-affinity site and a Kd = 400 nM for the low-affinity site whereas L657926 bound to one class of sites with a Kd = 380 nM. Stimulation of the TXA2/PGH2 receptor by SQ26655 and U46619 resulted in concentration-dependent increases in [Ca++], as measured by FURA-2 fluorescence, with EC50 values of 28 +/- 2 and 149 +/- 32 nM, respectively. I-PTA-OH, L657925 and L657926 antagonized this response to U46619 with IC50 values similar in rank potency to that seen in the binding studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By the 5th week of treatment, sensitivity to the rate-decreasing effects of naltrexone had increased 32-fold in FP monkeys (supersensitivity) but had not changed in SST monkeys; continued weekly injections of naltrexone did not change the effects of naltrexone further in either group. FP monkeys were more sensitive than SST monkeys to the rate-decreasing effects of other opioid antagonists and mixed agonist-antagonists; however, for some compounds (e.g., MR 2266) differences between groups did not exceed differences reported in nonsensitized monkeys responding under similar schedule conditions. Differences in sensitivity between FP and SST monkeys appeared to be stereospecific; FP monkeys were 28 times more sensitive than SST monkeys to (-)-cyclazocine, but equally sensitive to (+)-cyclazocine. Sensitivity to opioid agonists and to some nonopioids varied by less than 3-fold between groups and doses of lithium that decreased responding in FP monkeys had no effect in SST monkeys. Neither acute nor repeated injections of morphine altered the sensitivity of FP or SST monkeys to naltrexone; however, morphine attenuated the rate-decreasing effects of naltrexone in FP monkeys, and naltrexone reversed the rate-decreasing effects of morphine in all monkeys. Super-sensitivity to opioid antagonists in squirrel monkeys is behaviorally and pharmacologically selective as well as stereospecific. Although other effects of antagonists might contribute to supersensitivity, opioid antagonistic action appears to be one important component of supersensitivity and cross-supersensitivity among opioid antagonists.\r"

In addition, monkeys received daily injections of morphine (1.78 or 3.2 mg/kg) 3 hr before experimental sessions. With increasing doses of naltrexone monkeys switched in a dose-related manner from the saline to the naltrexone lever; complete generalization (greater than 80% responding on the naltrexone lever) occurred in all monkeys at doses of naltrexone larger than 0.0032 mg/kg. Doses of naltrexone that produced responding on the drug lever also produced effects typically observed during opioid withdrawal (e.g., miosis and salivation). Compounds with opioid mu antagonist effects under other conditions (e.g., nalorphine) substituted for naltrexone whereas a wide variety of opioid agonists (e.g., morphine, U-50,488 and butorphanol) as well as nonopioids (e.g., pentobarbital and ketamine) produced responding predominantly on the saline lever. Monkeys also switched to the naltrexone lever in a time-related manner after the daily injection of morphine with complete generalization occurring between 8 and 27 hr after morphine. Among a variety of opioid and nonopioid compounds, including drugs used in the treatment of opioid abuse (e.g., clonidine), only compounds with mu agonist actions under other conditions produced a switch in responding from the naltrexone to the saline lever in 27-hr morphine-abstinent monkeys. These results suggest single, daily injections of morphine are sufficient to produce dependence in rhesus monkeys and indicate further drug discrimination studies in morphine-treated rhesus monkeys might be pharmacologically more specific than observational procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The antagonism of muscarinic receptor-mediated contraction of rat trachea by a range of muscarinic antagonists was quantified by Schild and resultant analysis. Dose-response curves to carbachol, muscarine and oxotremorine were shifted to the right by gallamine and pirenzepine in a parallel manner with no change in maximal response ostensibly indicating simple competitive inhibition. However, Schild analysis indicated differences in the blockade and estimated pKb values with each agonist for both gallamine and pirenzepine. This suggested either that the responses to these three agonists were mediated by a heterogeneous receptor population in this tissue or that the blockade produced by gallamine and by pirenzepine was not competitive. Further Schild analysis with the muscarinic antagonists scopolamine, atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide and (11 [(2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine 6-one) with carbachol, muscarine and oxotremorine indicated simple competitive antagonism of a homogeneous population of muscarinic receptors. Therefore, the competitivity of binding of atropine, gallamine and pirenzepine with the scopolamine binding site was measured with the recently reported technique of resultant analysis. With this method the effect of various concentrations of the test antagonist on the antagonism produced by specified concentrations of the reference antagonist scopolamine was measured and the equilibrium dissociation constant of the test antagonist-receptor complex estimated. These data indicated that atropine and scopolamine bind to a common binding site on the muscarinic receptor, but that scopolamine and both gallamine and pirenzepine bind to mutually exclusive sites. This result is mine and pirenzepine are allosteric modulators of muscarinic receptors which bind at sites other than that utilized by agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pharmacokinetic parameters were examined in absolute and weight normalized terms. After an i.v. dose (range, 4.0-6.3 mg/kg) of prednisolone adjusted to achieve similar initial prednisolone plasma concentrations, the time course of glucocorticoid receptors in hepatic cytosol and hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) activity were examined. Plasma prednisolone concentrations declined biexponentially with time. Mean (S.D.) for prednisolone plasma clearance normalized for total body mass (TBM) was 2.3 (0.9) liters/hr/kg in normal rats and 2.7 (0.7) liters/hr/kg in obese rats. The volume of distribution at steady-state averaged 0.82 (0.46) liters/kg of TBM in normal rats vs. 1.08 (0.40) liters/kg of TBM in obese rats. Base-line receptor levels for obese rats were 53% higher than control levels. A model to describe simultaneously kinetics and receptor-mediated dynamics was used to analyze the data and obtain estimates for the efficiency of TAT induction. This efficiency parameter in obese rats was 22% of controls, reflecting the innate degree of diminished TAT response. This decreased response in obese animals may indicate a need for joint pharmacokinetic/dynamic considerations in dosing obese individuals with corticosteroids.\r"

Ethanol tolerance was induced in rats by repeated i.p. injections and measured by performance on the rotarod apparatus. Concurrent injections of nitrendipine prevented the development of tolerance to the ataxic action of ethanol. A similar effect was seen with the calcium channel antagonist PN 200-110 on tolerance to the general anesthetic effects of ethanol in mice. As previously reported, chronic ethanol administration increased the number of dihydropyridine binding sites in rat cerebral cortex. This was also prevented by the nitrendipine treatment; repeated administration of both ethanol and nitrendipine caused a decrease in the number of binding sites. The effect of nitrendipine on the tolerance was not due to alterations in body temperature, changes in blood pressure, differences in brain ethanol concentrations or residual nitrendipine in the brain at the time of testing. The results suggest that alterations in dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels may be involved in the adaptations that occur on chronic treatment with ethanol.\r"

The potency and magnitude of the bremazocine-induced diuresis were more pronounced in the nonhydrated group of rats. That bremazocine has a central component of action is deduced from the fact that 0.1 microgram of the opioid administered centrally caused a significant increase in urine output; proportionally, larger doses of bremazocine were required to produce the same diuretic effect when the drug was administered parenterally. Bremazocine did not change the total amount of urinary Na+ and K+ as compared to the saline controls; it increased significantly the free water clearance. The bremazocine-induced diuresis was antagonized in a competitive fashion by 10 mg/kg of naloxone giving further support to the notion that the mechanism of action of bremazocine involves activation of kappa-opioid receptors. Bremazocine injected i.v. to nonanesthetized rats increased mean systemic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner; the pressor action of the opiate was blocked and prevented by 1 mg/kg of naloxone. In contrast, i.c.v. administration of bremazocine did not change mean systemic blood pressure but produced a dose-related increase in urine output. To determine whether in addition to a central site bremazocine also activates a renal mechanism, experiments were performed in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Bremazocine (0.15-2.5 microM) caused a dose-dependent diuretic response and a significant rise in perfusion pressure as well as in glomerular filtration rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their arterial angiograms showed gradual narrowing of the arterial lumen and the histopathologic study showed striking intimal and medial proliferation as well as some increase in thickness of the adventitia. There was little evidence of thrombosis but in the 2 patients who were amputated early there was mononuclear cell infiltrate of the large arteries and in all 3 there was also leukocytoclastic vasculitis in the skin and/or muscle. We believe this represents a new form of vasculopathy, probably related to the presence of APLA, possibly triggered by the occurrence of vasculitis.\r"

Thirty of the 36 patients with SLE with recurrent fetal loss, 23 of the 163 patients with SLE without recurrent fetal loss, 3 of the 38 healthy women with recurrent fetal loss and no healthy woman with normal obstetric histories had APLA. In all but 3 of the patients with SLE with recurrent fetal loss these included APLA of the IgG isotype. Considering the odds ratio of having recurrent fetal loss as 1 for those patients with SLE without APLA, we found it to be 10.54 times higher in patients with SLE with high titer APLA. Titers of IgG APLA were also 3.2 times higher in patients with SLE with recurrent fetal loss than in those without. We conclude that recurrent fetal loss associates strongly with APLA of the IgG isotype.\r"

  ".W": "Sera from patients in the acute and recovery stages of parvovirus B19 infection, and from individuals with no detectable antiparvovirus antibody were examined for the presence of anti-DNA and antilymphocyte antibodies. Sixty-eight percent of individuals recently recovered from parvovirus infection had elevated levels of antidouble stranded (ds) and antisingle stranded (ss) DNA antibodies. In addition, a cytotoxic IgM antilymphocyte antibody was detected in more than 88% of these same sera. Serial specimens from volunteers experimentally infected with parvovirus B19 were also tested for these autoantibodies and it was determined that the presence of antilymphocyte IgM was dependent on the stage of infection. The antilymphocyte IgM was occasionally detectable in sera containing rubella specific IgM (11%) or varicella zoster specific IgM (25%). However, in contrast to B19 infection, these antibodies were not cytotoxic. From the results of our study, we propose that parvovirus infection of hematologically normal individuals may be accompanied by a transient, subclinical autoimmune state.\r"

Four of 180 patients with lupus seen in the last 10 years had patellar tendon rupture. Duration of disease ranged between 7-20 years. Each patient was in clinical remission at the time of rupture. Each patient also had deforming arthritis of the hands. All had been taking prednisone from 7 to 15 years and all had side effects associated with prednisone therapy, such as moon facies, compression fractures and osteonecrosis. Review of the literature reveals 17 patients with tendon rupture. All had disease of long duration, had been taking corticosteroids for prolonged periods and had minimal or no disease activity at the time of rupture. Deforming hand arthropathy was present in all patients, when mentioned. No cases of tendon rupture had been reported in patients not taking chronic corticosteroid therapy. Therefore, tendon rupture in SLE appears to be associated with extended disease duration, chronic corticosteroid therapy, evidence of steroid induced musculoskeletal complications, minimal disease activity and deforming hand arthropathy.\r"

Two thirds of the patients with spondyloarthritis were not suspected or known to have Reiter's syndrome or AS before referral. Since many diseases of the joints also affect the uveal tract, the recognition of the specific pattern of uveal involvement can greatly facilitate the differential diagnosis.\r"

The results from studies using this model have sometimes differed, but various areas of the joint have been compared. In other studies, the exaggerated chondrocyte synthetic response in the medial femoral condyle in this model which leads to hypertrophic repair was characterized. In this study the magnitude of this reaction was analyzed in 8 anatomically defined areas of the joint using 28 dogs followed from 3 days to 64 weeks after transection of the anterior cruciate ligament, 8 nonoperated control animals and 7 sham operated control animals. The results show that the in vivo reaction differs markedly among different anatomical areas of the joint. This suggests that the response is modulated by differences in the biomechanics of the joint. Furthermore, it suggests caution in comparing results of studies of OA cartilage if different areas of the joint have been used.\r"

No significant increase in UDPGD activity was noted in OA chondrocytes. The lack of significantly enhanced UDPGD activity in OA indirectly agrees with studies showing normal 35S uptake in this disease and might explain in part the inability of chondrocytes to cope with continuous proteoglycan loss.\r"

However, the cardiac status deteriorated later despite the absence of disease activity elsewhere. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed to determine the possibility of isolated myocardial relapse in case additional immunosuppression would be beneficial. Histology of the endomyocardial biopsy revealed myocardial fibrosis. Since cardiac involvement is the major cause of mortality in this condition and delayed treatment can lead to intractable cardiac failure, we advocate that endomyocardial biopsy should be performed more liberally and possibly serially to assess the disease activity in the myocardium. Immunosuppression may then be adjusted. To our knowledge, the occurrence of Churg-Strauss syndrome in Chinese has not been reported in the English literature.\r"

Tumor cells were obtained from 60 previously untreated, premenopausal patients with no metastases and with noninflammatory disease by fine needle sampling without aspiration. We could evaluate DNA ploidy in all patients and SPF in 50 or 83% of them. Tumor responsiveness was significantly related to SPF. The 12 patients who had SPF of 10% or more showed demonstrable regression; six had complete responses. None of the other parameters tested, i.e., DNA ploidy, histopathologic grade, or hormone receptor content, correlated with response. We believe this information may prove valuable for clinicians as they make their decisions regarding patient therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Present therapy for human bladder cancer includes the intravesical administration of antiproliferative agents, such as recombinant human interferon alfa (IFN-alpha). The administration of cytotoxic molecules encapsulated in liposomes could provide a more efficient method for such therapy. Therefore, we determined whether encapsulation of the recombinant human IFN-alpha hybrid BBDD within liposomes will produce antitumor effects against the human bladder cancer cell line 253J superior to those observed with free IFN-alpha. Adherent cells were cultured in medium alone, in medium containing different concentrations of IFN-alpha, or in medium containing multilamellar liposomes (phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylserine at a molar ratio of 7:3) that encapsulated saline or IFN-alpha. Cell growth was determined 96-120 hours later. Additional control groups consisted of target cells cultured with free IFN-alpha or with IFN-alpha plus liposomes containing saline. Cytostasis mediated by free IFN-alpha alone or IFN-alpha in the presence of liposome-saline was identical and ranged from 0%-30% (10 IU/mL) to 45%-70% (1,000 IU/mL). Liposomes containing saline produced no effects. Liposome-encapsulated IFN-alpha produced significantly greater growth inhibition than free IFN-alpha: 40%-70% (10 IU/mL) and 80%-90% (1,000 IU/mL), respectively. Moreover, a 253J variant subline selected for resistance to free IFN-alpha was sensitive to IFN-alpha presented in liposomes. These data suggest that the encapsulation of antiproliferative agents such as IFN-alpha in liposomes can improve therapeutic results.\r"

The model is termed a hybrid in the sense that the population-wide dynamics are described by a stochastic birth-death-migration model with transition probabilities dependent on the deterministic distribution of drug within the average cell. In the model, the probability that a cell dies is proportional to the concentration of drug within the target site in the cell. The micropharmacology describing the distribution of drug within the average cell is described by a standard well-mixed compartment model. Possible mechanisms that can confer drug resistance on a cell are described: decreased drug uptake, increased drug efflux, intracellular metabolism or inactivation, or both, of a drug, and a change in the level or sensitivity of a target. The biologic mechanisms underlying resistance and potential strategies for overcoming it are discussed within the context of our model. Results from a numerical simulation are presented as verification of the initial theory.\r"

Only one of 15 (6%) tumors from patients who had not received chemotherapy exhibited high levels of MDR1 transcripts, while 11 of 26 (42%) treated tumors showed high levels of MDR1 expression (Fisher exact test: P = .03). The results indicate that the level of MDR1 mRNA expression is associated with previous chemotherapy, including drugs that select the multidrug resistance phenotype in vitro regardless of neuroblastoma tissue origin or N-myc content in the genome. For the 26 treated neuroblastomas, the number of nonresponsive tumors was found to be significantly higher among those with high levels of MDR1 mRNA.\r"

Human melanoma, breast carcinoma, and colon carcinoma cells from parental lines and variants selected in vivo for metastasis and in vitro cloned lines were plated into medium containing 0.3%, 0.6%, 0.9%, or 1.2% of agarose. These cells were also injected into nude mice: intravenously for melanoma, into the mammary fat pad for breast carcinoma, and into the spleen for colon carcinoma. Production of tumor cell colonies in dense agarose (greater than 0.6%) correlated with production of experimental metastases in the lung (melanoma, breast carcinoma) or liver (colon carcinoma). We conclude that the degree of anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells can predict their biological behavior and metastatic potential in vivo. Thus, this technique may be useful for the isolation of metastatic cells from heterogeneous human neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "The combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with the immunomodulator levamisole (Lev) has been clinically tested in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma and as adjuvant therapy following primary tumor surgery. In some studies in advanced disease, the addition of Lev to 5-FU improved the median duration of response; in the adjuvant setting, the combination was associated with improvement in the disease-free survival. We studied whether Lev was directly toxic to three human colorectal carcinoma cell lines (HCT 116, SNU-C4, and NCI-H630). We also evaluated the toxicity of Lev in combination with 5-FU in these three cell lines. Lev inhibited the growth of all three colorectal cell lines, but only at concentrations two logs above that achieved with a standard 150-mg oral dose of Lev. In cell growth studies, 500 and 1,000 microM Lev increased the toxicity of 5-FU in HCT 116 cells in an additive fashion. In clonogenic assays, continuous exposure to 10 or 100 microM Lev was minimally toxic and did not enhance the lethality associated with a 24-hour exposure to 5-FU in any of the cell lines. Lev alone at 1,000 microM decreased colony formation by 45% in HCT 116 cells. A combination of 1,000 microM Lev with 10 microM 5-FU resulted in a decrease in HCT 116 colony formation from 54% to 6% of control levels. Continuous exposure of NCI-H630 cells to 500 microM Lev decreased colony formation to 76.5% of control levels; when Lev was combined with 50 microM 5-FU, colony formation was decreased from 59.5% to 27.5% of control levels. We conclude that at concentrations achievable with conventional doses of Lev, there was no evidence of direct toxicity in these colorectal cell lines. Furthermore, an additive interaction with 5-FU was evident only at suprapharmacologic doses of Lev.\r"

The strongest evidence of increased risk among white men was observed for painters, truck drivers, and drill press operatives. For painters, the overall relative risk was 1.5 [95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.2-2.0]. Among painters who started working prior to 1930, a significant trend in risk with increasing duration of employment as a painter was apparent; the relative risk for such painters employed 10 or more years was 3.0. For truck drivers and drill press operatives, overall risks were 1.3 (CI = 1.1-1.4) and 1.4 (CI = 0.9-2.1), respectively. We observed a significant, positive trend in risk with increasing duration of employment in each of these occupations, with relative risks peaking at approximately two for long-term workers. Excess risks were also observed for workers in several other occupations. In all, we estimate that 21%-25% of bladder cancer diagnosed among white men in the United States is attributable to occupational exposures.\r"

Our findings indicated that nonwhite men who were ever employed as auto workers have an elevated risk of bladder cancer [relative risk (RR) = 2.3; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.8-6.4] with a significant positive trend in RR with increasing duration of employment (P = .017) and with the RR rising to 4.7 for those employed at least 10 years. Dry cleaners, ironers, and pressers also experienced increased bladder cancer risk (RR = 2.8, CI = 1.1-7.4). Nonsignificant excesses of similar magnitude to those seen among white men were found for nonwhite men employed in several other occupations. Overall, our findings suggest that the risk of occupational bladder cancer among white and nonwhite men is similar. When inconsistencies between whites and nonwhites did occur, they appeared either due to chance or possibly racial differences in exposure among men within the same industry and occupation. In all, we estimate that the population attribute risk for occupation among nonwhite U.S. men is 27% (CI = 9% to 56%), which is slightly higher than the estimate of 21% to 25% previously reported for white U.S. men, although this difference was not statistically significant.\r"

One of these formulations, consisting of hydrogenated phosphatidylinositol (HPI), hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine (HPC), and cholesterol (Chol) (HPI-HPC-Chol), and a control formulation, consisting of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and Chol (PG-PC-Chol), were loaded with doxorubicin (DXR) and injected intravenously into BALB/c mice for pharmacokinetic studies. Although both formulations were similar in vesicle size, fraction of negatively charged lipid, and drug-to-lipid ratio, there were striking pharmacokinetic differences. DXR was cleared much faster in PG-containing liposomes than in HPI-containing liposomes. Liposome-associated drug was detectable in plasma up to 5 hours after injection in the case of PG-PC-Chol and as late as 72 hours after injection in the case of HPI-HPC-Chol. In agreement with the plasma clearance curves, peak drug concentrations in the liver were observed at 1/2, 5, and 24 hours after injection for free DXR, DXR in PG-PC-Chol, and DXR in HPI-HPC-Chol, respectively. Both types of liposomes reduced considerably the amount of drug accumulating in the heart compared with that accumulating after injection of free DXR.\r"

In contrast, J2 recombinant retrovirus infection of the fetal liver from C57BL/6-Ly-5a mice immortalized a cell line (GGD) that did not exhibit the characteristics of mature macrophages. The GGD cell line was classified as leukocytic on the basis of its expression of the Ly-6B.2, Fc gamma R, and Ly-5.2 antigens.

Complete data were available in 1233 patients who were treated recently, and these were analyzed. Acute renal failure, severe enough to require dialysis, developed in 5.5% of this group (68/1233): 2.3% and 7%, respectively, for descending (9/391) and thoracoabdominal repairs (59/842). Of interest, on multivariate analysis, both renal artery endarterectomy for occlusive disease (p = 0.0006) and chronic dissection (p = 0.03) were associated with significantly less acute renal failure. On multivariate analysis, the significant independent predictors (p less than 0.05) of acute renal failure were preexistent renal dysfunction, evidence of diffuse atherosclerosis, the use of the pump bypass, and markers of hemodynamic instability. Contrary to earlier reports based on a smaller number of patients, we found that neither the use of pump bypass (7% acute renal failure), atriorenal bypass (8% acute renal failure), nor cold Ringer's lactate (3% acute renal failure) appeared to significantly avert the complication of acute renal failure. Indeed, pump bypass appeared to be deleterious (p = 0.0146) and perfusion with cold Ringer's lactate was not without risk. Furthermore, in a prospective evaluation of angiotensin converting enzyme blockers, we were unable to show that they afforded renal protection after transient renal ischemia. This study has clarified the clinical problems associated with acute renal failure and lays the foundation for future research.\r"

  ".W": "The perioperative and long-term survival of patients who undergo resection of abdominal aortic aneurysm is often determined by coexisting cardiac disease. This study evaluates the influence of left ventricular ejection fraction on both perioperative and long-term morbidity and mortality. Preoperative ejection fraction was measured in 104 of 208 patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. Nineteen patients were found to have ejection fractions less than 0.35, and this group was compared to 85 patients with ejection fractions greater than 0.35. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, sex, preoperative renal function, or smoking status. The groups were significantly different with respect to the prevalence of prior myocardial infarction (79% of the low ejection fraction group vs 31% of the high ejection fraction group) and symptoms equivalent to New York Heart Association class II or greater (47% of the low ejection fraction group vs 24% of the high ejection fraction group) but not prior myocardial revascularization procedure (42% of the low ejection fraction group vs 31% of the high ejection fraction group). Surgical factors including aneurysm size, duration of aortic cross-clamping, and extent of arterial replacement did not differ significantly between the two groups. The perioperative mortality was not significantly different (low ejection fraction, 5%; high ejection fraction, 2%). The cumulative life-table survival of the two groups was not statistically different. Two patients in the low ejection fraction group died in the follow-up period, yielding a 4-year actuarial survival of 0.74. This is compared to 10 deaths and actuarial survival of 0.63 (p = NS) in the high ejection fraction group. We conclude that patients should not be denied aneurysm resection solely on the basis of left ventricular ejection fraction.\r"

Four cases are presented in which persistent retroperitoneal lymphoceles were discovered 2 to 8 years after surgery. Reexploration of the groin and repeated aspirations of lymphatic fluid failed to control the drainage. Reexploration of the retroperitoneum documented lymphatic injury, which was controlled by ligation of the lymphatics with suture. A review of the literature discloses five similar reported cases of retroperitoneal lymphocele and 12 cases of chylous ascites after abdominal aortic surgery. Clearly, avoiding lymphatic injury or immediate repair of any lymphatic injuries will prevent this problem. Once a persistent lymphocele has developed, aspiration will establish the diagnosis. Our experience would suggest that reexploration of the retroperitoneum is required to control the drainage and to prevent possible graft infection.\r"

Repair methods were ligation in two of six venous injuries and three of 18 arterial injuries, primary repair in three of six venous injuries and six of 18 arterial injuries, and autogenous saphenous vein graft in seven of 18 arterial injuries. Exploration and debridement, thrombectomy, and nonoperative management were used in one arterial injury each. Fasciotomy was employed in six of 13 arterial injuries in the extremities. There was one operative death, no reoperations, and no early or late amputations. Mean follow-up of 27 months demonstrated normal palpable and Doppler pulses (by noninvasive testing) distal to all arterial repairs. This study supports an aggressive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of noniatrogenic pediatric vascular trauma, emphasizing the liberal use of fasciotomy and meticulous vascular repair for the successful management of these challenging injuries.\r"

  ".W": "This article summarizes our experience with the operative management of renovascular hypertension in a contemporary population of elderly patients. During a recent 18-month period 35 of 74 patients (47%) undergoing an operation for renovascular hypertension at our center were in their seventh (21 patients) or eighth (14 patients) decade of life (mean age, 68 years). There were 17 men and 18 women with blood pressures ranging from 176/90 mm Hg to 280/215 mm Hg (mean, 213/121 mm Hg). Twenty-seven patients (77%) had renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.3 mg/dl). Nineteen patients had severe insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl), with five of these patients being dependent on dialysis. Thirty-three of 35 patients (94%) had evidence of organ-specific atherosclerotic damage as manifested by cardiac disease (72%), cerebrovascular disease (37%), or renal insufficiency (77%). Operative management consisted of unilateral revascularization in 17 patients (includes three contralateral nephrectomies), bilateral renal revascularization in 17 patients, and primary nephrectomy in one. Simultaneous aortic replacement was performed in nine patients. There were two operative deaths (5.7%) and two postoperative graft thromboses (4%). Hypertension was cured (three) or improved (27) in 30 of the 33 survivors (91%). Renal function was improved in six and worsened in two patients with severe non-dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency. Three of five patients who were dependent on dialysis before surgery were removed from dialysis after renal revascularization. On follow-up (mean, 10.3 months) we found that five patients had died. This article emphasizes the complexity of atherosclerosis in the current population presenting for operative management of renovascular hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "From 1977 through 1988, 16 patients underwent carotid artery resection and reconstruction or simple ligation in the treatment of advanced cervical carcinomas. Three patients underwent carotid artery ligation, with postoperative transient ischemic attacks, which resolved, in one patient. In the remaining 13 patients, interposition saphenous vein grafts were used to reconstruct the resected carotid arteries. In one of these 13 patients, the previously unresected carotid artery ruptured and was treated by carotid artery resection with interposition vein grafting and coverage by a myocutaneous flap. There were two immediate postoperative strokes, with excellent neurologic recovery in one, and one late postoperative stroke (6 months). There was one postoperative death. Adjunctive intraoperative irradiation (1500 to 2000 rad) was employed in 15 patients to decrease the risk of recurrent disease. Since 1982, pectoralis major muscle flaps have been constructed in all patients to cover the vein grafts, with no subsequent carotid artery blowouts. Seven patients are free of cancer more than 1 year after surgery. In conclusion, carotid artery resection for the treatment of advanced cervical carcinomas may be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates in carefully selected cases. Coverage of the vein graft by a myocutaneous flap appears to protect against carotid artery blowout. Intraoperative irradiation appears to decrease significantly the local recurrence rate of these aggressive tumors.\r"

Carcinoma was suspected but not proved, and a course of chemotherapy was administered. Two years later he was referred to Duke University Medical Center after he experienced a thromboembolic event in his left upper extremity. A CT scan and angiogram of the chest showed a large false aneurysm located 5 cm from the origin of the left common carotid artery and filling the anterior mediastinum. Additional history was obtained of multiple stab wounds to the left side of the chest 7 years before admission. The aneurysm was treated with sequential saphenous vein bypass grafting of right common carotid to left common carotid to left subclavian artery, followed by aneurysm thrombosis induced with wire coils. The differential diagnosis of a chest mass should include aneurysms of the great vessels.\r"

  ".W": "In the last 12 years we have performed 55 axillopopliteal bypass graftings with 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for limb salvage in 50 patients who were at high risk for limb loss. Indications for this procedure were (1) severe atherosclerotic disease of the common, superficial, and deep femoral arteries (33 cases); (2) failed aortofemoral bypass grafting with sufficient fibrosis or disease progression in the deep femoral artery (five cases); (3) insufficient hemodynamic and clinical improvement after axillofemoral bypass grafting (10 cases); and (4) sepsis in the groin from a previously infected graft (seven cases). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 8%, and the 5-year cumulative patient survival rate was 40%. Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative primary graft patency rates were 58%, 45%, and 40%, respectively. Comparable limb salvage rates were 83%, 68%, and 58%. Repeat operations increased 5-year patency rates from 40% to 59% (p less than 0.05). Three-year patency rate for grafts placed in the presence of poor angiographic runoff in one vessel was 62% and for good angiographic runoff (two to three vessels) it was 57% (NS). Grafts to the above-knee popliteal artery had a patency rate of 67% at 3 years, whereas for grafts that crossed the knee joint it was 51% (NS). Three-year patency rate for 24 straight axillopopliteal grafts was 42%, and for 31 sequential axillofemoral-popliteal grafts it was 74% (p less than 0.05). These results show that axillopopliteal bypass grafting is justified when other standard operations are not possible in patients who are in imminent danger of limb loss, and that every possible effort should be made to use the common or deep femoral artery as part of a sequential axillofemoral-popliteal procedure.\r"

  ".U": "89382813\r", 
  ".W": "Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts have been used extensively for infrainguinal vascular reconstruction either as the conduit of choice or as a substitute when saphenous vein is unavailable. Although numerous studies have shown satisfactory early patency rates, the long-term efficacy of these grafts in a large number of patients for specific indications and in various positions has been less well defined. From 1977 to 1987 we used four PTFE grafts from three different manufacturers to perform 300 infrainguinal reconstructions on 240 patients on our vascular service. The indications for surgery were disabling claudication in 28% and limb salvage in 72%. The 30-day operative mortality of 1% was not different from the 1.4% associated with infrainguinal autogenous vein grafting. The 5-year cumulative patency rate achieved with all infrainguinal polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was 35%, significantly higher for grafts placed for claudication (57%) than those placed for limb salvage (24%). There were no significant differences between the above-knee and below-knee locations for distal anastomoses regardless of indication, but femoropopliteal grafts provided significantly higher 5-year patency (37%) than infrapopliteal grafts (12%). Comparison of the 5-year patency rates among the three manufacturers of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts showed no significant differences. Fifty-four polytetrafluoroethylene grafts that failed underwent 67 revisions after catheter thrombectomy or thrombolysis, which resulted in a minimal 11% 5-year patency rate. Based on this experience, it is concluded that infrainguinal polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses provide significantly inferior results when compared with autogenous reconstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Confirmation of the diagnosis of lymphedema often requires lymphangiography, a procedure that is painful for the patient and technically demanding. Radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy is a relatively new technique that uses technetium 99 m antimony trisulfide colloid to produce a diagnostic image similar to a lymphangiogram. The procedure requires a single subcutaneous injection in the involved extremity, and images are obtained 3 hours later. It is technically easy to perform, produces minimal discomfort for the patient, and has no adverse effects. We have recently used radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy to evaluate 17 patients with extremity edema. These patients initially had a presumed diagnosis of lymphedema involving the upper or lower extremity. Lymphoscintigraphy confirmed the diagnosis of lymphedema in 12 (70.6%) patients. In five of the 17 patients (29.4%) the clinical impression of lymphedema was not supported by lymphoscintigraphy, leading to alternative diagnoses such as lipomatosis, venous insufficiency (two patients), congestive heart failure, and disuse edema. In all patients with secondary lymphedema the lymphatic system in the involved extremity could be partially visualized. Conversely, three of four patients with primary lymphedema had no ascent of the tracer from the foot and no lymphatic channels could be visualized. Lymphoscintigraphy is relatively easy to perform, safe, minimally invasive, and not uncomfortable for the patient. It is useful in differentiating lymphedema from other causes of extremity edema, allowing institution of appropriate therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to examine in peripheral arteries whether the endothelium plays a protective role against aggregating platelets and whether the responses to platelets are altered by hypercholesterolemia. Male Yorkshire pigs were fed either a normal diet or a 2% high-cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In isolated iliac arteries from control animals, aggregating platelets caused contractions that were significantly inhibited by the endothelium. In rings with endothelium from pigs fed a cholesterol diet, the contractions were augmented and no difference was noted between rings with and rings without endothelium. In rings taken from control pigs contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, aggregating platelets caused endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were attenuated by blockade of adenosine diphosphate or serotonin. Adenosine diphosphate and serotonin also caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. In arteries from cholesterol-fed animals, the inhibitory effects of the endothelium to aggregating platelets, adenosine diphosphate, and serotonin were impaired. These experiments indicate that in porcine iliac arteries the endothelium exerts inhibitory effects on the responses to aggregating platelets, which are mediated by adenosine diphosphate and serotonin released from platelets. Hypercholesterolemia impairs the endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets caused by reduced relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and serotonin and unmasks the contractions evoked by aggregating platelets. This may increase the level of vascular tone, decrease blood flow and increase platelet aggregation, and eventually facilitate the occurrence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial walls tend to adapt to maintain a specific wall shear stress. The formation of neointimal hyperplasia and endothelial cell healing of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts may also be governed by wall shear stress, which suggests that an optimal graft diameter may exist. To test this, 40 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts with internal diameters of 3, 6, and 8 mm were inserted end to end in the femoral and carotid arteries of 10 mongrel dogs. Total flow and diameter were measured, and grafts were stained with Evans blue dye, fixed by pressure perfusion, and analyzed by computer for anastomotic neointimal thickening, graft pseudointimal thickening, and degree of endothelial coverage. Mean calculated shear stress was 41 dyne/cm2 for the 3 mm grafts, 7 dyne/cm2 for the 6 mm grafts, and 3 dyne/cm2 for the 8 mm grafts. Fifteen weeks later the patency rate was 0 of 10 for the 3 mm grafts, 16 of 20 for the 6 mm grafts, and 7 of 10 for the 8 mm grafts. The mean graft shear stress was calculated to be 10 dyne/cm2 for the 6 mm grafts and 4 dyne/cm2 for the 8 mm grafts. Pseudointima lining the graft was composed of disorganized protein and cell remnants. The rough surface contained no overlying endothelium. Anastomotic neointima contained a layer of well-organized smooth muscle cells covered by a single layer of polygonal-shaped endothelial cells. A transition zone of thrombus, which is sandwiched by a wedge of smooth muscle cells near the graft surface and covered by endothelial cells, is described. Mean thickness of pseudointima of the patent 8 mm grafts was 150 microns thicker than that of the 6 mm grafts. Anastomotic neointimal thickness was 110 microns thicker in the 8 mm grafts compared with the 6 mm grafts. Among the 6 mm grafts, the carotid grafts had an average initial shear stress of 10 dyne/cm2, whereas the femoral grafts averaged a lower 5 dyne/cm2 and yielded pseudointima and neointima that were 40 microns thicker. The percent graft surface area covered with neointima did not differ among the grafts of differing diameter either proximally or distally. Lower shear stresses produced greater amounts of pseudointimal thickening within polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and neointimal thickening at their anastomoses. Conversely, the high shear stress from small-diameter grafts was associated with poor graft patency. These results suggest that an optimal graft diameter may help to prevent neointimal hyperplasia and graft thrombosis.\r"

Flow rates through the leg were determined with a magnetic resonance blood flow scanner. All patients had claudication; one had gangrene, another had an ulcer, and two complained of rest pain. The median age was 65 years, and 72% were men. There were 25 dilations of the iliac artery, 12 of the superficial femoral artery, and eight of the popliteal arteries; nine patients had two arterial segments dilated. Nineteen legs had ankle/arm pressure indexes before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of less than 0.80 (range 0.51 to 0.75); their flow rates averaged 40 +/- 20 (SD) ml/min. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty flow and pressure increased significantly in 14 of these 19 legs, and three had no hemodynamic improvement; in one leg only pressure and in another only flow increased significantly. The remaining 17 extremities had ankle/arm pressure indexes before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ranging from 0.81 to 1.09; their flow rates averaged 53 +/- 27 (SD) ml/min. Abnormal flow rates were detected in 15 of these 17 extremities. With near-normal ankle/arm pressure indexes no significant increase in pressure was anticipated. Flow rates augmented to 75 +/- 28 (SD) ml/min after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; a significant increase in flow was noted in 12 legs (71%). For patients with ankle/arm indexes before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of less than 0.80, either pressure or flow measurements should corroborate the benefits of the operation, whereas if the ankle arm index is greater than 0.80, flow measurements are most likely to substantiate changes in peripheral hemodynamics.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was undertaken of 127 lower extremity fasciotomies performed for compartment syndrome after acute ischemia and revascularization in 73 patients with vascular trauma and 49 patients with arterial occlusive disease. One hundred twelve (88%) fasciotomies were performed early (at the time revascularization); 15 (12%) were delayed because of late compartment syndrome diagnosis. Ninety-four (77%) patients had more than one accepted indication for fasciotomy. Double-incision fasciotomy was used in 98 (77%) extremities, single-incision fasciotomy was used in 19 (15%), and fasciotomy-fibulectomy was used in 10 (8%). Fasciotomies were closed in 88 (69%) patients an average of 14 days after surgery. Seven patients needed multiple skin grafting procedures or myocutaneous flaps to close the wound; none compromised limb salvage. Five other patients had minor wound infections that resolved. Functional status returned to preoperative levels by the time of discharge from the hospital in 59 (48%) patients. Thirty-one (24%) patients had residual lower extremity disability related to delayed union of the fracture (five), chronic neuropathy (20), leg swelling (one), or ischemic nonhealing fasciotomy wounds (three); two patients had unrelated disabilities. Fourteen (11%) amputations were required for refractory limb ischemia; two (1.6%) were required for wet gangrene of the foot, which infected the fasciotomy site; the others had open noninfected incisions. Eighteen (15%) patients died of cardiopulmonary failure or multisystem failure or both, without fasciotomy-related problems. Open fasciotomy for compartment syndrome after acute lower extremity ischemia and revascularization was associated with an increased risk of minor wound morbidity. However, limb loss and death resulted from persistent ischemia and underlying systemic disease processes or injuries, but not from open fasciotomy wound complications.\r"

Indications for the procedure included claudication in 29 (78%) segments, and the occlusion lased was greater than 7 cm in length in 51% of the procedures. Failure to recanalize the occlusion occurred in 14 (30%) segments, and recanalization followed by in-hospital reocclusion occurred in seven (15%) segments, yielding an initial failure rate of 45%. Initial failures were noted in 40% of the less than 3 cm occlusions, 33% of the 4 to 7 cm occlusions, and 54% of the greater than 7 cm occlusions. In nine (43%) instances in these 21 failures there was extension of the occluded segment or decline of the ankle/brachial index or both, precipitating the need for surgery in three (18%) of these 17 patients. Among the successfully treated group, 17 (65%) of these vessels in 15 patients reoccluded from 1 to 14 (mean, 3 1/2) months after the procedure. Cumulative patency among the successfully lased vessels was 69% at 1-month, 38% at 6 months', 29% at 12 months', and 14% at 15 months' follow-up. Fifteen-month patency was 7% of the entire series of 47 vessels treated. Eighteen complications occurred after 15 (32%) of these 47 procedures. Based on these results, the widespread application of laser probe angioplasty cannot be justified without further clinical and laboratory investigation.\r"

The incidence of hypertension was 8.8% among 102 intervention group participants vs 19.2% among 99 control group members. The odds ratio for the incidence of hypertension in the control group was 2.4. Mean trial blood pressure also was lower in the intervention compared with the control group (-1.2 and -1.9 mm Hg, respectively, for diastolic blood pressure at work-site and office visits and -1.3 and -2.0 mm Hg, respectively, for systolic blood pressure at the two sites). Net weight loss in the intervention group averaged 2.7 kg during the trial; sodium intake was reduced by 25% and reported alcohol intake decreased by 30%. The majority of intervention participants also reported an increase in physical activity. Effect on blood pressure was related particularly to degree of weight loss. Results indicate that even a moderate reduction in risk factors for hypertension among hypertension-prone individuals contributes to the primary prevention of the disease.\r"

To answer these questions, we surveyed a nationwide sample of 2000 interviews (response rate, 75%). Forty-five percent of all respondents believed that physicians who were HIV infected should not be allowed to continue to practice. More than half of those who had seen a physician in the past 5 years said they would change physicians if they knew their physician were HIV infected, while one fourth said they would seek care elsewhere if their physician were treating people with HIV disease. These data suggest that patients are concerned about HIV in their physicians' offices. The American Medical Association recommends that HIV-infected physicians continue to practice as long as there is no risk to their patients. Physicians and the public need to be educated about this policy and its appropriateness.\r"

However, more representative community-based studies relied on self-reports or ratings. We conducted the first study to use both a community-based sample (N = 529) and comprehensive measures of health (an interview, a limited physical examination, and blood testing). Shelter dwellers compared with homeless persons sampled elsewhere were less likely to have used illegal drugs, to have been victimized, to have injured skin, and to have elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and mean corpuscular volumes. Sixty-two percent of persons observed to have high blood pressure were unaware of their condition. Sampling only shelter dwellers, or relying only on reports of illness by homeless adults, may mask or underestimate existent health problems that are revealed by community-based sampling techniques and more objective measures.\r"

  ".W": "A 43-year-old woman with severe coronary artery disease and hyperapobetalipoproteinemia was heterozygous for an abnormal Msp I apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene fragment because of the absence of the MspI site around codon 4046 in exon 29 of the APOB gene. Using the polymerase chain reaction technique, 134 base pairs containing the mutant Msp I site were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The mutation was a C to T transition, substituting tryptophan for arginine at amino acid position 4019 of the mature ApoB-100 protein. Seven relatives of the proband had the same mutation, which has been called \"ApoB-100 Hopkins.\" Only three of seven relatives with the mutation had hyperapobetalipoproteinemia; one was borderline while two other relatives without the mutation had hyperapobetalipoproteinemia. Mutant low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was bound and degraded to a greater extent than normal LDL in cultured human fibroblasts. In conclusion, a new mutation, ApoB-100 Hopkins, was not linked to the hyperapobetalipoproteinemia phenotype, which also was segregating in this family. The increased affinity of this mutant LDL for the LDL receptor may be due to a specific effect of ApoB-100 Hopkins or to altered LDL size and composition.\r"

The present study was designed to determine the effect of another catabolic condition, starvation, on amino acid transport in skeletal muscle. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (40-60 g) were starved for 24, 48, or 72 hr and soleus (SOL) muscles were removed intact and incubated for 2 hr in a medium consisting of Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) with glucose (5 mM), [14C]-inulin, and [3H]-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB). Amino acid uptake was determined from intracellular to extracellular ratio of AIB following incubation. AIB uptake was significantly reduced after 24 hr of starvation and remained low with further fasting. After 72 hr the AIB distribution ratio was approximately 50% of initial value. Amino acid uptake returned to normal within 24 hr after refeeding of animals that had been starved for 72 hr. Plasma (0.25 ml) from starved rats, added to the incubation medium (2.75 ml) of muscles from nonfasted rats, significantly inhibited AIB uptake. The present results suggest that amino acid uptake in skeletal muscle is progressively reduced during starvation, an effect that may be mediated by a circulating factor(s) present in blood.\r"

Among them, nine had been given dexamethasone for at least 6 days. The other seven had not received any corticosteroids. There was no significant difference in the Glasgow Coma Scales of the treated and untreated groups. Metabolic balance studies were carried out for at least 3 days, including the periods when the treated patients were receiving dexamethasone. Mean nitrogen balance was -0.296 +/- 0.03 g/kg/day for the treated group and -0.182 +/- 0.03 g/kg/day for the untreated group. This difference was significant (p = 0.02, t-test). Our metabolic data are also consistent with those of other published studies, which used other corticosteroids and somewhat different methodologies. Thus, it is clearly established that corticosteroids cause significant degrees of catabolism in head injured patients, beyond what would \"normally\" be expected in such patients if they did not receive these drugs.\r"

The three diets had the same caloric, nitrogen, vitamin, and mineral contents. Rats had free access to the liquid diets. Only rats which ate the whole diet (90 cal) were included in the study. No differences in steatorrhea and fecal nitrogen were observed. The absorption rate was over 95% on the three diets. In contrast, weight gain was statistically better on WPH (+9% after 96 hr of realimentation) than on WP (+5%) or AAM (+2%). This was associated with a statistically higher nitrogen retention at all time periods studied, which was a result of a significant lower nitrogen urinary excretion. Similar results were obtained in controls. This better growth was a result of a better protein synthesis and lower ureagenesis.\r"

Fourteen patients were treated with anticoagulation and/or thrombolytic therapy. Of seven patients treated with HC/BC in situ, one required HC/BC removal to achieve CR-CVT resolution. Median follow-up post-CR-CVT was 362 days (range 34-1622). No patient suffered untoward long-term sequelae. Nine patients had 11 catheters placed following resolution of CR-CVT. None had repeat thrombosis. CR-CVT incidence in a single 12-month period was 3.7% (7/190). The placement of HC/BC in an oncology population is an acceptably safe method for long-term venous access.\r"

Substitution of drinking water by a 50 mM rubidium chloride solution for 9 to 11 days led to significant hypokalemia (plasma potassium 2.5 +/- 0.1 mM; plasma potassium plus rubidium 3.3 +/- 0.1 mM). Compared to a control group (reduction of plasma potassium to 3.4 +/- 0.1 mM by short-term potassium depletion) with a fractional potassium excretion of 2.1 +/- 0.3%, rubidium-treated rats excreted potassium at a much higher rate of 14.6 +/- 3.0%. The potassium content of principal cells was, however, significantly lower in rubidium-treated than in potassium-deprived animals. Similar to experiments in which rubidium was given acutely (3 hours), chronic rubidium administration was associated with preferential accumulation of rubidium in all tubule cells relative to potassium. Rubidium clearances were uniformly below those of potassium. Amiloride abolished the difference between rubidium and potassium clearances and sharply reduced the excretion of both cations. In view of the known site of action of amiloride, this suggests a distal tubule site of rubidium action on potassium transport. Amiloride also reduced or abolished the preferential uptake of rubidium into all but intercalated tubule cells. Marked cell heterogeneity of rubidium accumulation into intercalated cells was observed: One subpopulation, with low cell chloride, retained rubidium more effectively than another subpopulation with high cell chloride.\r"

DA-1 receptors were quantitated by the specific binding of 125I-SCH 23982, a DA-1 antagonist (defined by 20 microM SCH 23390, a DA-1 antagonist) and DA-2 receptors by the specific binding of 3H-methyl-spiroperidol or 3H-spiroperidol (defined by 30 microM trifluperidol, a predominantly DA-2 antagonist). The specific binding of 125I-SCH 23982 and 3H-methyl-spiroperidol or 3H-spiroperidol were saturable with time and ligand concentration and reversible. Analysis of Rosenthal plots by non-linear regression revealed a high affinity site and a very low affinity site for both BLM and BBM. Maximum receptor density was similar in BBM and BLM. Competition experiments with 125I-SCH 23982 revealed high and low affinity binding sites in both BBM and BLM. The high affinity site was characteristic of a DA-1 receptor. Competition experiments with 3H-spiroperidol were also suggestive of DA-2 receptors. DA-1 but not DA-2 drugs increased adenylate cyclase and phospholipase-C activities in both BBM and BLM. However, their effects were greater in BLM than BBM. We conclude that DA-1 and DA-2 receptors are present in both BBM and BLM in canine kidney. Renal DA-1 receptors are linked to stimulation of both adenylate cyclase and phospholipase-C activity.\r"

After 28 days of i.p. cyclosporine (Cs; 25 mg/kg/day) in UNx and sham nephrectomized (SNx) rats, the single kidney GFR was higher in UNx animals (0.55 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.05 ml/min, P less than 0.04) as was RPF (3.05 +/- 0.46 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.37 ml/min, P less than 0.04). Morphometric evaluation of the chronic tubulointerstitial lesion (TI) demonstrated lower scores and relative protection in the UNx group (16.48 +/- 3.52 vs. 64.76 +/- 18.30, P less than 0.01). In separate groups of rats undergoing UNx or SNx and subsequent treatment with Cs, dry kidney weights confirmed that compensatory renal hypertrophy was present in UNx animals. The modulating effect of dietary protein on the lesion of CCN was studied in UNx rats fed a 5% or 60% protein diet during the period of Cs treatment. At the end of the study period animals fed the high protein diet demonstrated a higher RPF (3.19 +/- 0.58 vs. 1.58 +/- 0.29 ml/min, P less than 0.04), higher GFR (0.55 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.04 ml/min, P less than 0.05) and lower TI score (64.45 +/- 17.35 vs. 130.32 +/- 23.48, P less than 0.04) when compared with animals consuming a low protein diet. We conclude that the relative renal vasodilation induced by partial ablation of renal mass and high protein feeding affords some protection against the development of CCN.\r"

Lactate production was found to be inhibited by bumetanide in a dose-dependent manner, a maximum inhibition of 22% was obtained at 10(-4) M bumetanide and an apparent Ki of 10(-8) M was determined. Bumetanide inhibition of lactate production was dependent on the presence of sodium and chloride. Chloride removal inhibited lactate production also by 20%. Bumetanide (10(-4) M) inhibited by 35% sodium uptake into PCD cells exposed to 10 mM ouabain and chloride uptake into ion depleted PCD cells by 40%. In addition, this bumetanide-sensitive chloride uptake was dependent on the presence of sodium and potassium in the incubation medium. Furthermore, 86Rb uptake into these cells was significantly reduced in the presence of 10(-4) M bumetanide. These data provide evidence for the operation of a Na-K-Cl cotransport system in rat papillary collecting duct cells. This transport system might be involved in active chloride transport in the papillary collecting duct and/or volume regulation of the PCD cells.\r"

  ".W": "Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and lysolecithin acyltransferase (LAT) are two activities carried out by the same plasma enzyme, but require different apoprotein activators. The LCAT reaction takes place primarily on high density lipoproteins (HDL) and is activated by serum albumin, whereas LAT takes place on low density lipoproteins (LDL) and is inhibited by albumin. In nephrotic syndrome (NS), the levels of serum albumin are reduced, whereas the LDL levels are increased, and therefore, the ratio of LAT/LCAT activities should be increased. To test this hypothesis, we estimated the lipid levels and the two enzyme activities in experimental NS induced in rats by the injection of anti-Fx1A antibody (passive Heymann nephritis). As found in other nephrotic conditions, the plasma lipid levels rose progressively as the proteinuria increased and the serum albumin concentration declined. In addition, the ratio of LAT/LCAT activities increased by about fourfold after nine days of induction of nephritis. The LCAT activity correlated positively and the LAT activity negatively with serum albumin levels. The esterified cholesterol correlated positively with LCAT activity in normal rats but negatively in nephrotic animals, indicating that most of the cholesteryl esters in NS may be non-LCAT derived. The free cholesterol/lecithin ratio, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, increased significantly in nephrotic rats. Furthermore, since the increase in the LAT activity produces more disaturated lecithins, another putative risk factor, the cumulative risk of coronary heart disease may be increased in long-term NS.\r"

  ".W": "Because rat peritoneal macrophages exhibit a particular binding capacity to rat glomerular mesangial cells in vitro, we have studied the effect of macrophages on two plasma membrane enzymes, ecto-5'-nucleotidase and ecto-Mg2+ ATPase, or rat cultured mesangial cells. A marked increase of ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity was observed in cocultures of rat mesangial cells and peritoneal macrophages. In addition, macrophage-conditioned medium (MCM) produced a dose-dependent increase of mesangial cell ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. In contrast, ecto-Mg2+ ATPase activity was unaffected. The effect of MCM on ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity was apparent after 24 hours and increased with time. Reversion was obtained by MCM withdrawal. Stimulation of ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity by MCM was inhibited by cycloheximide, which suggests that protein synthesis was required. Induction of enzyme activity by MCM depended in part on the presence of extracellular adenosine. The macrophage-released factor responsible for this effect was non-dialysable, heat-stable at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes but heat-inactivated at 100 degrees C for five minutes, inactivated in the presence of trypsin or protease V8, and adsorbed on charcoal. Its apparent molecular weight estimated by gel chromatography was close to 20 kD. MCM from resident macrophages was as potent as MCM from thioglycollate-elicited or zymosan-stimulated macrophages. This stimulatory effect was specific of macrophages since it was absent in the culture medium of rat fibroblasts or mouse thymocytes but present in that of mouse macrophages. These results suggest that peritoneal macrophages synthesize a factor which selectively stimulates ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity of glomerular mesangial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Compared to cellulose acetate, hemodialysis with cuprophan membranes is associated with greater activation of the alternative pathway of complement. Previous studies have shown that this difference is not due to a greater number of potential covalent binding sites for activated C3 on cuprophan. To investigate further the factors that influence complement activation by hemodialysis membranes, proteins were eluted from serum-treated cuprophan and cellulose acetate membranes with hydroxylamine at alkaline pH and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Approximately 23 times more total protein was removed from cellulose acetate. Virtually all the C3 in the cellulose acetate eluate was in the form of inactive fragments C3c and C3dg. In contrast, the functionally active form of C3 (C3b) was a prominent constituent of the cuprophan eluate. The binding of factor B (precursor of the catalytic subunit of the C3 convertase) and factor H (regulatory protein of C3 activation) to serum-treated membranes was also analyzed. By Scatchard's method, the affinity constant at equilibrium for factor B binding (KB) to the two types of membranes was not significantly different; however, there were approximately four times more factor B binding sites on the cuprophan than on the cellulose acetate. For cuprophan, the number of factor B binding sites was 1.6 times greater than the number of factor H binding sites. These studies demonstrate that a portion of the C3b molecules that bind to cuprophan are protected from degradation, and suggest that the complement activating capacity of hemodialysis membranes is determined by biochemical properties that modulate both the binding of serum proteins to the membrane and the interactions of the endogenous regulatory proteins with membrane-associated C3b.\r"

Patients with persistent proteinuria and prolonged hypercholesterolemia are probably at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Until recently there has been no safe and effective treatment for this disorder. The effects of gemfibrozil on plasma lipids and lipoproteins in hypercholesterolemic patients with the nephrotic syndrome were therefore studied. Eleven patients with the nephrotic syndrome were studied in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial with six-week treatment periods. Gemfibrozil 600 mg or placebo was administered twice a day. There was a third unblinded period in which seven patients received gemfibrozil plus the bile acid-binding resin, colestipol, 10 grams twice a day. Gemfibrozil treatment produced a marked reduction in plasma triglyceride (51%, P = 0.001) and a 15% decrease in plasma total cholesterol (P = 0.003). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 13% (P greater than 0.05), high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased 18% (P = 0.006) and the ratio of low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein cholesterol fell 26% (P = 0.01). Apolipoprotein A-l was unchanged while apolipoprotein B decreased 26% (P = 0.006). Four patients were unable to complete period 3 because of gastrointestinal symptoms. The remaining patients had further improvement in plasma lipids and lipoproteins with the combined therapy: total cholesterol further decreased 26%, triglycerides decreased 17%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 36%, high-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fell 33%. Gemfibrozil improved lipid and lipoprotein cardiovascular risk factors without major toxicity. Persistent elevations in total plasma and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol during gemfibrozil treatment, however, indicate the need for individualized drug therapy.\r"

In 12 patients with a proteinuria varying from 3.2 to 10.5 g/24 hr, a diastolic BP ranging from 64 to 105 mm Hg, and a GFR varying from 34 to 127 ml/min, the effect of different lisinopril doses and of changing dietary sodium intake was evaluated. Proteinuria fell by 27 +/- 20% from 6.1 +/- 2.1 to 4.5 +/- 1.9 g/24 hr on a low dose (median 5 mg/day) lisinopril and by 50 +/- 17% to 3.1 +/- 1.4 g/24 hr on a higher dose (median 10 mg/day), irrespective of initial proteinuria, BP, or GFR. This antiproteinuric effect was abolished by increasing salt intake from 50 to 200 mmol/day, and was recovered again by re-instituting the sodium restricted diet. The antiproteinuric effect of 10 mg/day lisinopril was comparable to the reduction in proteinuria (by 57 +/- 21% to 2.8 +/- 2.0 g/24 hr) on 150 mg/day indomethacin, while adverse effects were less and renal hemodynamic effects were more favorable during lisinopril. In some patients it took several weeks before the effect of the ACE inhibitor on proteinuria was stabilized. Thus, the antiproteinuric effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril appears to be dose and time related, and is strongly dependent on dietary sodium restriction, whereas it does not depend on initial proteinuria, BP, or GFR. The effect is comparable to that of indomethacin, while adverse effects are less.\r"

The independent risk, adjusted for age, known coronary artery disease, diabetes, level of systolic blood pressure, and treatment (dialysis or transplantation), was 2.9 (95% confidence intervals, 1.3 to 6.9) for all-cause mortality and 2.7 (95% confidence intervals, 0.9 to 8.2) for cardiac mortality.
