The carcinomas exhibited predominantly mixed intermediate and fusiform/spindle subtypes; in seven carcinomas there were at least some foci of oat cell subtype. There was no histologic evidence of typical carcinoid tumor. Seven cases were fixed in solutions appropriate for immunohistologic study; these exhibited prominent neuron-specific enolase activity but less prominent and more variable staining for the carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratins. All 17 cases were deemed resectable and had no clinical or radiologic evidence of metastasis. Seven (41%) patients died with recurrent and/or metastatic carcinoma (average survival, 1.7 years); five of these patients had carcinomas with at least some foci of oat cell foci subtype.\r"

In the other five patients, the specimen contained a dominant adenocarcinoma and several 0.1- to 1-cm nodules of similar histologic appearance. In four of the 50 single tumor patients and one of seven double tumor patients, 1- to 2-mm nodules were found along with adenocarcinomas that we interpreted as being bronchioloalveolar tumors of uncertain malignant potential. An analogy is drawn between these four types of findings and single tumors of the colon, double tumors of the colon, polyposis syndromes, and tubular adenomas of the colon, respectively.\r"

Vascular invasion was found in 37.6% of patients and neural invasion in 14.3%. The following three types of vascular invasion were identified: tumor lining epithelium, tumor thrombi, and destruction of the vessel wall. The incidence of metastases in patients with vascular invasion was 60% as opposed to 17% in those without vascular invasions (P less than 0.0001). Survival in these patients was 29.7% and 62.2%, respectively (P less than 0.003). Metastases were found in 72.7% of patients with neural invasion, as opposed to 27% of those without neural invasion (P less than 0.01). Survival was 29.6% as opposed to 57.7% in those without neural invasion (P less than 0.003). Even among patients in the same Dukes' stage, prognosis, as determined by incidence of recurrence, metastases, and survival, was worse significantly among those patients demonstrating vascular invasion (P less than 0.03). Examination of patients with colorectal carcinoma for the presence of vascular and neural invasion may provide useful information for determining future treatment and prognosis.\r"

The sensitivity of the cytologic procedure was 92%, the specificity 95%, the predictive value of positive cytologic diagnosis 88%, and the predictive value of a negative cytologic diagnosis 97%. Potential pitfalls in the localization and aspiration procedures are discussed. The results of cytologic examination should always be correlated with the mammographic findings, and further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions should be based on both modalities. In this setting, x-ray guided fine-needle aspiration cytologic study is a highly valuable diagnostic tool.\r"

The detection rate (DR) of preclinical asymptomatic distant metastases depended on the T and N category (TNM classification system), and was very low (CXR: 0.30%, BXR: 0.64%, BS: 0.90%, LE: 0.24%, LS: 0.23%). The sensitivity, determined after a 6-month follow-up, was below 0.50% for all tests. The highest value (0.48%) was recorded for BS, which also had the lowest specificity (0.95%). The entire preoperative staging policy using the studied tests seems questionable due to poor sensitivity and an extremely low DR of distant metastases.\r"

Bone marrow biopsy was performed in 142 consecutive unselected metastatic patients: 129 at the time of first recurrence, and 13 in patients with metastases at the time of first diagnosis. Overall, BMB was positive in 32 patients (23%). In the group with negative bone x-ray, it was positive in two patients of 84 (2%); both of them had doubtful scan. In the group with positive x-ray, BMB resulted positive in 30 of 58 (52%). There was a significant correlation between number of bone segments radiologically involved and BMB positivity rate, ranging from 15% in the patients with only one, to 68% in those with more than three sites involved (P = 0.02). Patients with x-ray evidence of metastases in the pelvis had significantly higher rate of BMB positivity (67% versus 32%; P = 0.02). The median survival time from the first relapse was 153 weeks in BMB-negative cases and 149 in positive ones. Considering only the patients with demonstration of bone invasion obtained with either or both x-ray and BMB, 34/62 patients had positive BMB (55%). In these cases BMB was found more often positive in patients 50 years or younger than in patients older than 50 years (80% versus 47%; P = 0.05); the median survival time was longer, but not significantly, in BMB-positive patients than in negative ones (149 weeks versus 119; P = 0.3). The authors conclude that BMB is not required in common restaging procedure when both bone survey and scan are negative. Bone marrow biopsy results are more often positive in younger patients and survival is not negatively affected by bone marrow invasion as diagnosed by BMB.\r"

All occurred in Chinese aged 60 years and older, constituting a prevalence rate of about 3% in this age group. If unsuspected colorectal carcinomas in Chinese Singapore residents aged 60 years and older exist in those who died in 1984 to the same extent as that noted in this autopsy study, it was estimated that 146 additional cases would have been added to the Cancer Registry in that year. This would constitute 47.9% of the total number of colorectal cancers diagnosed in this age group in 1984. This potential contribution has to be taken into consideration in epidemiologic studies on the incidence and future trends of colorectal cancers in Singapore. It was observed further that incidental carcinomas were found predominantly in the ascending colon. With more frequent use of colonoscopy, the incidence of right-sided cancers of the large bowel may be expected to increase. The current underdiagnosis of ascending colon carcinomas has to be taken into consideration when any future increase in right-sided cancers of the large bowel is observed.\r"

In the responding patients, treatment was continued in the same dose and schedule for 3 additional months. Interferon was tolerated without major toxicity by most patients. Objective tumor response (one complete response and four partial hematologic responses [PHR]) was observed in five of ten patients (50%). Severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia developed in one of the nonresponders at 8 weeks. Therefore, treatment had to be discontinued. Our study demonstrated single alfa-2b-interferon antitumor activity in untreated B-CLL patients with stable disease, and indicated that further trials of alfa-2b-interferon, possibly combined with chemotherapy, may be justified.\r"

Treatment of recurrent childhood gliomas has been disappointing and the effectiveness of therapy has been difficult to judge because of the variable natural history of the disease. Information gathered recently has suggested that treatment with [1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea)] (CCNU) and vincristine (VCR) after radiotherapy is effective in prolonging survival in children with newly diagnosed anaplastic gliomas. The authors have used these same drugs--CCNU (100 mg/m2) and VCR (1.5 mg/m2 up to a maximum dose of 2 mg)--in 6-week cycles for a maximum of eight cycles in children with recurrent gliomas. To date, 15 patients have been treated; five patients had malignant gliomas and ten low-grade gliomas. Three children showed improvement, five had stable disease, and seven had progressive disease. Of the five patients with malignant gliomas, four progressed within two cycles of treatment and one had stable disease for 7 months on treatment and then relapsed. Seven of ten children with low-grade gliomas benefitted from treatment and six remain in continuous remission a median of 16 months after initiation of therapy. Three of these children are off all therapy 21, 30, and 30 months after treatment, respectively. Therapy was well tolerated and toxicity consisted primarily of reversible bone marrow suppression. The authors conclude that CCNU and VCR chemotherapy is effective in children with recurrent low-grade gliomas and can result in relatively long-term disease stabilization. In limited experience of the authors, it is not of benefit in children with recurrent anaplastic lesions.\r"

Arterial access was obtained by retrograde cannulation of the superficial temporal artery. One patient died of sepsis from leukopenia (mortality 5%). Catheter-related complications, most of them avoidable, totalled 30%. The total tumor response rate was 94%. With a median duration of follow-up of 14 months, the median survival of the group was not yet reached at 39 months. Eleven patients subsequently underwent definitive surgery and radiation with curative intent. When compared with matched historical controls, survival benefit was demonstrated: 60% versus 28% alive at 39 months (P = 0.015). Regional chemotherapy of cancers of the head and neck region is a feasible procedure with acceptable and avoidable morbidity.

Overall survival for the complete responders was 79+ and 61+ weeks, respectively. Median survival for all patients was 36 weeks.

A comparison of our data with 18 previously published series, indicates that use of postsecond-look intraperitoneal 32P can improve the progression-free interval, and possibly overall survival, of patients with NED or minimal residual disease without adding significant complications.\r"

Eight meningiomas were assayed and found to have androgen-binding protein. Three tumors were subjected to in vitro growth studies in varying concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The growth of tumor 1 was unaltered. Tumor 2 demonstrated 9% to 10% growth (P less than 0.05) in all concentrations tested. Tumor 3 revealed an 11% stimulation, but only in the lowest concentration of DHT tested. The small quantity, saturability, and in one tumor, high binding affinity, suggest this binding protein is a receptor. The in vitro response of these meningiomas was small and was not dose-related or proportionate to receptor quantity. Androgens do not appear to play as important a role as progesterone or estrogen in meningioma growth in vitro.\r"

Of the 316 cancers evaluated, 150 (47%) expressed PG II. The prevalence by histologic type was 55% in 146 glandular tumors, 43% in 83 diffuse tumors, 16% in 25 mucoid tumors, and 51% in 59 mixed-type cancers. Two parietal cell cancers and one undifferentiated cancer were PG II-negative. In glandular and diffuse cancers, but not mucoid and mixed tumors, both the extent of gastric wall invasion and incidence of lymph node metastases were associated positively with PG II expression by the primary tumor. In particular, PG II-reactive cells were found significantly more often in advanced than in early diffuse cancers (P less than 0.05) and significantly more often in submucosal early cancers than in intramucosal early cancers (P less than 0.01). The prevalence of PG II expression also was higher significantly in metastatic cancers than in nonmetastatic cancers. This was true for advanced gastric cancers as a whole (P less than 0.01), advanced glandular-type cancer alone (P less than 0.01), advanced glandular- and diffuse- type cancers together (P less than 0.001), and early diffuse-type cancer (P less than 0.05). Only four (3%) of 145 cancers evaluated for pepsinogen I (PG I) were positive, and each also was positive for PG II. The results suggest that the expression of PG II by glandular and diffuse types of gastric cancer may be a marker of increased malignancy.\r"

Mean pulmonary artery, left atrial, and capillary pressures were determined and used to calculate arterial and venous resistances, and lung weight was continuously monitored. Substance P (0.01-1.0 microM) caused marked increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, capillary pressure, venous resistance, and lung weight within 3-5 minutes after administration. These responses remained elevated above baseline at the end of the 30-minute experimental period in the Ringer's-perfused lungs but not in the blood-enriched Ringer's-perfused lungs. Substance P did not alter the capillary filtration coefficient in isolated lungs and transendothelial albumin permeability in the endothelial monolayer. Substance P resulted in an increase in venous effluent thromboxane B2 concentrations in perfused lungs but had no effect on 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentrations. Papaverine (0.27 mM) (a smooth-muscle relaxant) abolished the pulmonary microvascular response to substance P in Ringer's-perfused lungs, and meclofenamate (0.15 mM) (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) attenuated the pulmonary vasoconstriction and lung weight increase. Pyrilamine (1.0 microM) (a histamine1-receptor antagonist) did not alter the responses to substance P. In conclusion, substance P does not affect pulmonary vascular permeability to water and protein. Substance P induces an intense pulmonary vasoconstriction (due to greater constriction of postcapillary vessels) and an elevation in pulmonary capillary pressure that increases net transvascular fluid filtration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine the effect of sympathetic neural activation on the transmural distribution of myocardial perfusion distal to a flow-limiting coronary artery stenosis. Treadmill exercise in conscious dogs was used as a physiological stimulus to activate the sympathetic nervous system. In the experimental model, the anterior region of the circumflex artery was innervated, but the posterior circumflex region was treated with phenol to produce regional sympathectomy within the stenotic territory. Myocardial perfusion to innervated and sympathectomized left ventricular regions was measured before and after inflation of the occluder to reduce distal coronary pressure to 45 mm Hg. Measurements were obtained during control conditions with the animal standing on the treadmill, during inflation of the occluder with the animal standing, during exercise alone, during exercise with beta-adrenergic blockade, and during exercise with combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. Exercise (6 km/hr) resulted in a marked increase in heart rate from 128 +/- 9 (standing) to 218 +/- 7 beats/min. beta-Adrenergic blockade blunted the tachycardia during exercise (146 +/- 6 beats/min). Under control conditions (while standing), there were no differences in myocardial perfusion between the innervated and sympathectomized regions, 187 +/- 26 and 181 +/- 24 ml.min-1.100 g-1, respectively. During exercise or in combination with beta-adrenergic blockade, subepicardial perfusion was significantly less (18-25%) in the innervated stenotic region than that in the sympathectomized stenotic region. In contrast, subendocardial perfusion was significantly greater in the innervated stenotic region (17-26%) than that in the sympathectomized stenotic region. The subendocardial-to-subepicardial blood flow ratio during exercise was 0.60 +/- 0.08 in the innervated stenotic region and 0.42 +/- 0.07 in the sympathectomized stenotic region (p less than 0.05). During exercise with beta-adrenergic blockade, the endocardial-to-epicardial blood flow ratios in the innervated and sympathectomized stenotic regions were 0.47 +/- 0.09 and 0.37 +/- 0.07, respectively (p less than 0.05). These differences were abolished during alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. These data indicate that alpha-adrenergic coronary constriction distal to a flow-limiting stenosis facilitates redistribution of blood flow toward the subendocardium. This redistribution was produced by alpha-adrenergic constriction in the outer layers of the left ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "The contributions of histamine (H1 or H2) receptor-mediated responses and, therefore, the effects of histamine blocking agents are unclear with regard to regulation of proximal epicardial and distal resistance coronary arteries. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of selective H1- and H2-receptor antagonists on epicardial and resistance vessels in the closed chest dog model. Histamine, diphenhydramine (H1 blocker), and cimetidine (H2 blocker) were infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and responses were studied by quantitative coronary angiography and flow measurements (133Xe washout). Histamine infusion alone produced a significant dilation of the proximal LAD (13% above control) only at the highest dose (45 micrograms/min), while LAD flow was increased by 128%. In the presence of H1 blocker, histamine produced significantly greater epicardial dilation (55% above control). The flow response curve was shifted to the right in the presence of H1 blocker, but the flow attenuation was overcome by the highest histamine dose. In contrast, the H2 blocker attenuated both epicardial dilation (6% below control) and flow response (31% above control) to the highest histamine dose. Results support a differential regulation of proximal epicardial and distal resistance vessels to histamine with epicardial arteries demonstrating H1-mediated vasoconstriction and H2-mediated vasodilation and distal resistance vessels showing H1- and H2-mediated vasodilation. In addition, these findings suggest that H1 blockade may antagonize histamine-related vasoconstriction and vasospasm, while H2 blockers may permit unopposed H1-mediated vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries and also limit resistance vessel vasodilatory responsiveness in the presence of elevated tissue histamine, as may occur in atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between nonuniform epicardial activation and ventricular repolarization properties was studied in 14 pentobarbital anesthetized dogs and with a computer model. In 11 dogs, isochrone maps of epicardial activation sequence were constructed from electrograms recorded from the pulmonary conus with 64 electrodes on an 8 X 8 grid with 2-mm electrode separation. The heart was paced from multiple sites on the periphery of the array. Uniformity of epicardial activation was estimated from activation times at test sites and their eight neighboring sites. Acceleration shortened and deceleration prolonged refractory periods. The locations of acceleration and deceleration sites of activation differed during drives from various sites, and differences in uniformity of activation during pairs of drives were correlated to differences in refractory periods (r = 0.76, range 0.59-0.93). In three additional experiments, transmural activation sequence maps were constructed from electrograms recorded from needle-mounted electrodes placed upstream and downstream to epicardial activation delays. Activation proceeded from epicardium to endocardium upstream to the delays and from endocardium to epicardium downstream to the delays. A computer simulation of two-dimensional action potential propagation based on the Beeler-Reuter myocardial membrane model provided insights to the mechanism for the results of the animal experiments. The two-dimensional sheet modeled the transmural anisotropic histology of the canine pulmonary conus and corresponded to previous reports and histology of specimens from five experiments. Simulated activation patterns were similar to those found in the experimental animals. In addition, action potentials were electronically prolonged at sites of deceleration and shortened at sites of acceleration, results comparable to the animal experiments. Our findings demonstrate that the location of areas of nonuniform epicardial activation is dependent on drive site and that nonuniform activation electronically modulates repolarization properties. Therefore it seems likely that the site of origin of ectopic ventricular complexes, especially in ischemic myocardium where activation is nonuniform, could be an important determinant of whether ectopic activity initiates sustained tachyarrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the Ca2+-transport properties of the plasma membrane and of the endoplasmic reticulum of bovine pulmonary artery, membrane vesicles are subfractionated by a procedure of density-gradient centrifugation that takes advantage of the selective effect of digitonin on the density of plasma-membrane vesicles. The obtained endoplasmic-reticulum fraction contains hardly any plasma-membrane vesicles, whereas the plasma-membrane fraction is still contaminated by a substantial amount of endoplasmic-reticulum vesicles. An adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) energized Ca2+-transport system and a Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity are present in both subcellular fractions. The Ca2+ transport by the plasma membrane is catalyzed by a (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase of Mr 130,000. It binds calmodulin and it has a low steady-state phosphoprotein intermediate level. The endoplasmic-reticulum vesicles contain a Ca2+-transport ATPase of Mr 100,000 that is characterized by a high steady-state phosphointermediate level. It is antigenically related to the Ca2+-pump protein of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban, the regulatory protein of the Ca2+-transport enzyme of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, is also present in the endoplasmic reticulum of the pulmonary artery. A comparison of these fractions with the previously characterized fractions from porcine gastric smooth muscle reveals important differences in the basal Mg2-ATPase activity, in the ratio of the (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase of the plasmalemma to that of the endoplasmic reticulum, and in the ratio of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity to the plasmalemmal (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase activity. These differences can be ascribed in part to the species and in part to the tissue. These data suggest that in the bovine pulmonary artery the Ca2+ extrusion via the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump may have a less predominant role, and that the Ca2+ uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum, and possibly also the Ca2+ extrusion via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger could be more important in this tissue than in the porcine stomach.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that alpha-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction helps maintain a uniform transmural distribution of myocardial blood flow during exercise was tested in dogs. Carotid artery loops were surgically constructed and a splenectomy performed three weeks prior to study. On the day of study, the dog was anesthetized briefly (fentanyl and nitrous oxide) for percutaneous catheterization, and alpha-receptors in one myocardial region were blocked with phenoxybenzamine (0.25 mg/kg) infused selectively into the left circumflex coronary artery. Recirculation of phenoxybenzamine was minimized by drainage of coronary sinus outflow during the infusion. After the dog recovered from the anesthesia, regional blood flow was measured at rest and during graded treadmill exercise with the microsphere technique calibrated by reference blood samples. Average transmural flow was limited by alpha-vasoconstriction and was less in the region where alpha-receptors were intact than in the region where they were blocked, as has been described by others. The ratio of inner layer myocardial blood flow to outer layer flow was better maintained in the region with alpha-receptors intact than in the region with alpha-receptors blocked when myocardial oxygen consumption was 150 microliter/min/g or greater (p less than 0.001). Even though average transmural flow was limited by alpha-receptor activation, inner layer myocardial blood flow was greater in the region with alpha-receptors intact than in the region with alpha-receptors blocked when myocardial oxygen consumption was 500 microliter/min/g or more (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction mediated by alpha-receptors helps to maintain a uniform transmural distribution of myocardial blood flow during exercise in spite of limiting average transmural flow.\r"

We used ryanodine and caffeine, which are known to modulate the oscillatory release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum. During 30 minutes of left main coronary artery ligation, all 13 control hearts developed ventricular premature beats (number of beats, 225 +/- 51) and ventricular tachycardia (duration, 123 +/- 21 seconds); five hearts developed ventricular fibrillation. In a separate series of experiments, reperfusion after 15 minutes of coronary artery ligation caused ventricular fibrillation to occur within 15 seconds in all 12 hearts. Ryanodine (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) abolished ventricular arrhythmias during coronary artery ligation and prevented reperfusion ventricular fibrillation. Ryanodine (10(-9), 10(-8), and 10(-7) M) caused 15%, 23%, and 74% decreases in the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure development and 20%, 32%, and 85% decreases in the maximal rate of fall of left ventricular pressure development, respectively, prior to coronary artery ligation. During acute myocardial ischemia, ryanodine 10(-9) M maintained and 10(-8) M impaired left ventricular function; 10(-7) M caused left ventricular failure. Coronary perfusion rate did not increase during ischemia. Antiarrhythmic activity occurred independent of preservation of high energy phosphates, reduction in tissue lactate, or tissue cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the ischemic myocardium. Caffeine 10(2) M decreased the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during ischemia and upon reperfusion; protection occurred coincident with development of diastolic contracture. Caffeine increased ischemic tissue cyclic adenosine monophosphate content and worsened tissue energy status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Collagenase treatment of canine ventricular tissue produced a yield of 40-60% healthy cells. Myocytes had normal resting and action potentials as measured using conventional microelectrodes. Quinidine decreased Vmax, amplitude, overshoot, and the duration of action potentials stimulated by passage of brief current pulses through the recording pipette. Recovery was complete after washout except that action potential duration was prolonged compared with control. A discontinuous single microelectrode voltage (\"switch\") clamp was used to measure ionic currents. Quinidine irreversibly reduced steady-state outward current as measured with three different voltage clamp protocols. Quinidine reversibly decreased peak calcium current as well as the slowly inactivating and/or steady-state inward currents in the plateau voltage range, presumably both \"late\" sodium (tetrodotoxin-sensitive) and calcium (tetrodotoxin-insensitive) currents. The effect on calcium current showed both tonic and use-dependent block. Thus, quinidine has a multitude of actions on both inward and outward currents, which combine to produce the net effect of quinidine on action potential configuration.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of rapid cooling on the recovery process from anoxia-induced hypodynamic state was studied in isolated rat ventricular muscle and ventricle. Following 10-15 minutes' perfusion of N2-saturated Krebs solution, the muscle was reoxygenated. When the muscle was rapidly cooled for 10-30 seconds during the early phase of reoxygenation, the rate of recovery from contracture significantly increased (p less than 0.01). Rapid cooling was also effective on the recovery from contracture induced by superfusion of Krebs solution with lowered sodium chloride concentration, but it did not affect the recovery from rigor induced by CN-. In the recovery from sustained anoxia (60 minutes), cooling facilitated reattainment of tension development and reduction in contracture tension. Similarly, in whole heart, 2-3 episodes of rapid cooling for about 60 seconds significantly accelerated the recovery of pressure development after 30 minutes of anoxia. At 60 minutes after reoxygenation, pressure development in hearts that were reoxygenated without rapid cooling was 29.8 +/- 26.9% (mean +/- SD) of pressure developed before anoxia. This value increased to 93.8 +/- 27.5% following recurrent rapid cooling (p less than 0.001). At the same time, rapid cooling prevented any significant elevation in resting tension (development of oxygen paradox). These results indicate that excess intracellular calcium ions were removed by rapid cooling. This relief of the myocardium from calcium overload is believed to improve mitochondrial function and result in facilitated recovery of contractile activity.\r"

The changes in mechanical and electrical behavior, as well as protein phosphorylation, that followed the apparent activation of protein kinase C by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were examined. As spontaneous beating frequency was increased minimally by 10 nM TPA and by 100% with 85 nM TPA, shortening amplitude, shortening velocity, and relaxation velocity decreased concomitantly. In contrast, 4-alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (alpha-PDD), which does not activate protein kinase C, had no effect on beating behavior at 800 nM. In voltage-clamped single myocytes, both steady-state and transient components of the cadmium-sensitive calcium current were increased by the addition of TPA (65 nM). Neither the time constant for the inactivation of the transient component of this calcium current nor the reversal potential was altered by TPA. The phosphorylation state of a discrete set of proteins, with apparent molecular weights of 32 and 83 kDa, was enhanced when TPA was added to intact myocytes. Angiotensin II enhances the phosphorylation state of the same set of proteins as observed with TPA. We conclude that activation of protein kinase C can modify mechanical behavior and increase L-type Ca2+ channel activity in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The remarkable similarity in mechanical, electrical, and protein phosphorylation responses of cultured neonatal myocytes following TPA or angiotensin II application indicate that protein kinase C may mediate the action of angiotensin II.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanical properties of mammalian ventricular cardiac muscle have been studied in the presence and in the absence of an intact endocardial surface. Isotonic and isometric twitch contractions were obtained from papillary muscles of the right ventricle of cat at 29 degrees and 37 degrees C, at different extracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]o), and at different initial muscle lengths. The endocardial surface was damaged by gentle abrasion of the muscle surface with a plastic blade or by brief immersion for 1 second with 1% Triton X-100. Although there was no evidence of damage to myocardial cells, damaging the endocardial surface resulted in an immediate and irreversible abbreviation of the twitch contractions with, except at the highest ([Ca2+]o, a decrease in peak isometric twitch tension. These changes induced 1) an asymmetrical shift of the tension-[Ca2+]o relation towards increasing [Ca2+]o but with no effect at the highest [Ca2+]o, and 2) a rightward and downward shift of the length-tension relation. Both shifts were significantly more pronounced at 37 degrees C than at 29 degrees C; they were not accompanied by significant changes in Vmax. The asymmetrical shift of the tension-[Ca2+]o relation suggests that the endocardium-mediated chain of events may be mediated by changes in the sensitivity of the contractile proteins to Ca2+. This hypothesis is also supported by the similar pattern of changes (i.e., modulation of the onset of early tension decline) induced by decreasing length at each [Ca2+]o and by the removal of a functional endocardium. Accordingly, the endocardium may help to control the performance of the heart by modulating peak contractile performance and relaxation of the underlying myocardium.\r"

Rats subjected to right nephrectomy and two-thirds segmental infarction of the left kidney (5/6 nephrectomy) were treated for 10 weeks with the lipid-lowering agent clofibric acid. Both serum cholesterol and urine albumin excretion were significantly reduced by clofibric acid. At 10 weeks, the percent of glomeruli with focal glomerulosclerosis was 5 +/- 2% in clofibric acid-treated and 24 +/- 5% in untreated 5/6 nephrectomy rats (p less than 0.01). Inulin clearance was greater in clofibric acid-treated than in untreated 5/6 nephrectomy rats (0.28 +/- 0.02 versus 0.22 +/- 0.02 ml/min 100 g body wt, p less than 0.05). Body weight, kidney weight, and systemic blood pressure were not significantly altered by clofibric acid. Micropuncture studies, performed in separate groups of clofibric acid-treated and untreated 5/6 nephrectomy rats, demonstrated elevated single nephron glomerular filtration rates and glomerular capillary pressures 4 weeks after surgery. However, clofibric acid did not significantly alter single nephron glomerular filtration rates (95 +/- 2.1 nl/min in treated versus 97.0 +/- 6.2 nl/min in untreated, p greater than 0.05) or glomerular capillary pressures (56.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in treated versus 57.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg in untreated, p greater than 0.05) in 5/6 nephrectomy rats. In a separate set of experiments, 5/6 nephrectomy rats were treated with the specific cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, mevinolin. Mevinolin improved serum lipid levels and reduced albuminuria in 5/6 nephrectomy rats without causing significant alterations in blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We calculated the wavelength of the atrial impulse in chronically instrumented conscious dogs by measuring both conduction velocity and refractory period: wavelength = refractory period X conduction velocity. Implantation of multiple stimulating and recording electrodes allowed wavelength determination at four different areas: the right and left parts of Bachmann's bundle and the free walls of the right and left atria. During programmed electrical stimulation, three types of arrhythmias were observed: rapid repetitive responses, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation. During normal rhythm, the wavelength of the atrial impulse varied between 14 and 18 cm. Premature beats had a shorter wavelength, depending on the degree of prematurity. Premature beats that evoked rapid repetitive responses showed a critical shortening of the wavelength below 12.3 cm. Episodes of atrial flutter were induced at a wavelength below 9.7 cm, while fibrillation occurred at wavelengths shorter than 7.8 cm. We correlated the induction of these arrhythmias with the values of refractory period, conduction velocity, and wavelength during control and during administration of several drugs. Intravenous administration of acetylcholine shortened the wavelength by 30-40%, mainly because of refractory period shortening. Both propafenone and lidocaine had strong but opposite effects on refractoriness and conduction and, consequently, little effect on the wavelength. Quinidine markedly prolonged the refractory period, but prolongation of wavelength was less because of a simultaneous decrease in conduction velocity. d-Sotalol also increased refractory period, but because it had no appreciable effect on conduction velocity, this drug was the most effective in prolongation of wavelength. Linear discriminant analysis of the data showed that the refractory period and the conduction velocity each were poor parameters to predict the occurrence of the different arrhythmias (predictive value 48% and 38%, respectively). The combination of both properties, however, as expressed in the wavelength, was a more reliable index that predicted the induction of the different arrhythmias correctly in 75% of the cases. We conclude that the wavelength is a useful parameter for evaluating antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

Estimated prevalence of angina was 50% less in the U.S. sample than in the U.S.S.R. sample, and this was consistent with the proportion of subjects excluded from the exercise test because of angina. In both samples, subjects with ECG abnormalities had higher systolic blood pressures.

  ".U": "88109878\r", 
  ".W": "Arterial baroreceptors in the carotid sinus (CBR) and aortic arch (ABR) regions exert important control over heart rate and peripheral vascular responses to changes in arterial pressure. The relative roles of these two baroreflex pathways on control of sympathetic nerve activity during sustained elevation of arterial pressure in man is unknown. We therefore studied the relative contributions of the carotid versus the aortic baroreflexes on the control of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) during elevation of arterial pressure in normal human subjects. In eight normal men (group I), we measured MSNA (microneurography) during sustained elevation of arterial pressure produced by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (PE) alone (combined ABR and CBR activation) versus during PE infusion with superimposed application of sustained external neck pressure (NP). NP was applied during sustained PE infusion to eliminate the increase in transmural carotid sinus pressure and thus remove CBR activation, thereby causing ABR stimulation alone. Mean arterial pressure was measured directly, central venous pressure was held constant during PE infusion, and MSNA was measured as total activity (burst frequency X amplitude) and expressed as units. Infusion of PE (ABR and CBR activation) increased mean arterial pressure from 87.2 +/- 2.8 to 94.9 +/- 2.9 mm Hg (+/- SE, p less than .001). This was accompanied by a decrease in heart rate from 65.8 +/- 3.4 to 56.1 +/- 3.3 beats/min (p less than .001) and a decrease in MSNA from 236.2 +/- 47.5 to 84.5 +/- 19.3 units (p less than .001). During infusion of PE with superimposed NP (ABR activation alone), mean arterial pressure increased further to 101.2 +/- 2.9 mm Hg (p less than .001 versus control or PE alone), and heart rate returned to control levels of 62.9 +/- 2.0 beats/min (p = NS vs control; p less than .01 PE vs PE plus NP), but MSNA remained reduced at 48.6 +/- 9.2 units (p less than .01 vs control; p = NS vs PE alone). Thus, combined activation of ABR and CBR resulted in a 65 +/- 5% attenution of MSNA, while activation of ABR alone resulted in a 73 +/- 7% attenuation of MSNA. In a separate series of experiments in seven subjects (group II) we used sustained external neck suction alone to activate the CBR (leaving the ABR either unchanged or minimally deactivated) and studied the MSNA responses to this CBR activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The effects of 0.04 mg/kg of atropine on the right ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were determined in the setting of beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol (0.15 mg/kg loading dose, then 0.1 mg/min continuous infusion, group 1) and in the setting of beta-adrenergic stimulation by 25 or 50 ng/kg/min isoproterenol (groups 2 and 3, respectively). Groups 4 to 6 served as control groups. In group 4, VRPs were determined on three occasions separated by 10 min each in the absence of drug. VRPs also were determined on two occasions after infusion of propranolol (group 5) or 25 ng/kg/min of isoproterenol (group 6). Groups 1 to 4 consisted of 10 subjects each, and groups 5 and 6 consisted of five subjects each. VRPs were determined with the use of basic drive cycle lengths of 600, 500, 400, and 350 msec. Because of sinus tachycardia, sufficient data for comparison of groups 1 to 3 were available only at drive cycle lengths of 400 and 350 msec. Atropine significantly shortened the VRPs in groups 1 to 3, but the magnitude of atropine's effects in group 3 (5.3% to 5.8% shortening at drive cycle length of 350 msec) was significantly greater than in group 1 (2.6% to 3.0% shortening, p less than .05) Data from the control groups demonstrated that there was no effect of time on measurement of VRPs either in the drug-free state or in the presence of propranolol or isoproterenol. The results of this study indicate that cholinergic tone lengthens VRPs in the absence of background sympathetic activity and that this lengthening of VRPs may become accentuated during beta-adrenergic stimulation.\r"

By least-squares analysis, the times of day that the 52 attacks (one from each patient) occurred were fit to a sinusoidal density function with a period of 24 hr. The highest relative incidence of tachycardia was at 4 P.M.; tachycardia was five times more likely to occur at 4 P.M. than at 4 A.M., the time of the lowest relative incidence. A second attack of tachycardia was recorded from 35 of the 52 patients. The times of the two attacks in individual patients were found to be independent; thus the times of day at which the second attacks occurred were used as a test set for the distribution estimated from the first. The empirical distribution for the times from the 35 second attacks was compared with the distribution function estimated from the 52 first attacks, and there was no significant departure; this finding confirmed the circadian pattern. Since the relative incidence of attacks of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is higher in the afternoon, it may be helpful to target antiarrhythmic therapy to that time of day.\r"

The T wave map abnormalities were observed in 24 of 48 patients (50%) with angina and were classified into three types: (1) type I (18 patients, 37.5%) was characterized by a segmental negative potential in the positive area located at the left thorax and the minimum at the peak of T wave positioned in the upper portion of the left anterior chest, (2) type II (three patients, 6.3%) was characterized by a negative potential with a minimum in the inferior thorax and an indentation of negative potential at the lower margin of the positive potential located over the upper thorax, and (3) type III (three patients, 6.3%) was characterized by a negative potential with a minimum at the back throughout the period of T wave. All patients showing T wave map abnormalities of type I had a significant stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. Likewise, all patients with type II or III had single-vessel disease of the right coronary or left circumflex artery, respectively. All types of T wave map changes observed in patients with angina were different from those in patients with left ventricular overload, whose maps showed the generalized negative potential at the inferior thorax and the left back and the minima clustered at the precordium. In seven patients with lesions of the left anterior descending artery, T wave map abnormalities of type I recovered to normal after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The behavior of the negative potential and its extrema on the T wave map, which was not available from routine electrocardiography, was indicative of the involved coronary artery and probably of its associated ischemic area in one-half of our patients with angina pectoris.\r"

In this study, cross-sectional two-dimensional Doppler flow mapping of the left atrium was used to quantify postoperative regurgitant flow in 29 patients. Its severity and location was related to the shape of the three leaflets of the left component of the atrioventricular valve, especially to the size of the mural leaflet. To identify which leaflet configuration was likely to cause regurgitation, the position of the leaflets was obtained from the parasternal short-axis view and the angular size of the mural leaflet expressed in degrees of an arc. Doppler mapping was performed in the apical four-chamber and the parasternal long-axis views, dividing the left atrium in nine squares in each. Regurgitation was defined as a jetlike systolic downstroke of the Doppler frequency shift in early systole. The angular size of the mural leaflet varied from 38 to 144 degrees (mean 86 +/- 36 SD). Massive regurgitation (six to nine sites) was encountered in seven patients, five with a mural leaflet size of over 110 degrees, one with mural leaflet size between 70 and 110 degrees, and one with a mural leaflet size of under 70 degrees. No or minimal regurgitation was encountered in 10 patients, three having a mural leaflet size of 70 to 110 degrees and seven with a mural leaflet size of less than 70 degrees. These data suggest that massive regurgitation is encountered in patients with large mural leaflets, whereas patients with smaller mural leaflets tend to have no or mild regurgitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Videodensitometry is a nongeometric method of coronary angiographic analysis that can be used to provide an index of coronary luminal area. However, there are few direct studies in vivo of the relationship of videodensitometric data to independent measures of luminal area in humans. Although videodensitometry is theoretically independent of angiographic projection and luminal shape, validation of these assumptions in vivo is also limited. We therefore used intraoperative high-frequency epicardial echocardiography, a technique that can directly determine human coronary luminal area and shape in vivo, to further validate videodensitometry. A total of 36 arterial segments in the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries were studied by videodensitometry and high-frequency echocardiography. Videodensitometry was performed on angiograms in which the arterial segment of interest was not markedly foreshortened and was uniformly filled with contrast. In 22 discrete lesions (13 with circular lumens and nine with oval or complex lumens), videodensitometric and echocardiographic measures of luminal area correlated well (r = .86). In 33 coronary arterial segments, the effect of angiographic projection on videodensitometry was determined by comparison of the results of videodensitometry performed on left anterior oblique vs right anterior oblique angiograms of the segments. Here too, the correlation was good (r = .94, y = 1.04x + 0.002). The good correlation of left anterior oblique with right anterior oblique videodensitometric results held true for lesions with circular and oval or complex lumens. This study further validates the ability of videodensitometry to provide an index of coronary luminal area and confirms in vivo previous assumptions that the results of videodensitometric analysis are independent of angiographic projection and luminal shape.\r"

  ".W": "Data from experimental, clinical, and pathologic studies have suggested that the process of restenosis begins very early after coronary angioplasty. The present study was performed to determine prospectively the incidence of restenosis with use of the four National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the 50% or greater diameter stenosis criteria, as well as a criterion based on a decrease of 0.72 mm or more in minimal luminal diameter. Patients were recatheterized at 30, 60, 90, or 120 days after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). After PTCA all patients received 10 mg nifedipine three to six times a day and aspirin once a day until repeat angiography. Of 400 consecutive patients in whom PTCA was successful (less than 50% diameter stenosis), 342 underwent quantitative angiographic follow-up (86%) by use of an automated edge-detection technique. A wide variation in the incidence of restenosis was found dependent on the criterion applied. The incidence of restenosis proved to be progressive to at least the third month for all except NHLBI criterion II. At 4 months a further increase in the incidence of restenosis was observed when defined as a decrease of 0.72 mm or more in minimal luminal diameter, whereas the criteria based on percentage diameter stenosis showed a variable response. The lack of overlap between the different restenosis criteria applied affirms the arbitrary nature of angiographic definitions currently in use. Restenosis should be assessed by repeat angiography, and preferably ascertained according to the change in absolute quantitative measurements of the luminal diameter.\r"

Sixteen clinical, 35 angiographic, and seven procedural variables were analyzed. Multivariate analysis found seven independent preprocedural factors related to closure: stenosis length of 2 or more luminal diameters, female gender, stenosis at a bend point of 45 degrees or more, stenosis at a branch point, stenosis-associated thrombus (filling defect or staining), other stenoses in the same vessel, and multivessel disease. In addition, four procedural factors were found to be associated with closure by univariate analysis: post-PTCA percent stenosis (p less than .001), intimal tear or dissection (p less than .001), use of prolonged heparin infusion (p less than .001), and post-PTCA gradient of 20 mm Hg or more (p = .004). Multivariate analysis of both preprocedural and procedural variables found six factors independently related to closure: post-PTCA percent stenosis, dissection, prolonged post-PTCA use of heparin, branch point location, fixed bend point location, and other stenoses in the vessel dilated. The risk of coronary closure after PTCA has many determinants. While an estimation of risk can be made before performing PTCA, the most powerful predictors of closure can only be assessed during the procedure itself.\r"

In nine of the patients a single bolus of 2 g completely abolished the TdP within 1 to 5 min, and in three others complete abolition of the TdP was achieved after a second bolus was given 5 to 15 min later. Nine of the patients also received continuous infusion of MgSO4 (3 to 20 mg/min) for 7 to 48 hr until the QT interval was below 0.50 sec. In nine of the 12 patients the TdP was induced by antiarrhythmic agents. The QT interval preceding TdP ranged from 0.54 to 0.72 sec. After the MgSO4 bolus, which prevented the recurrence of TdP, no significant changes were observed in the QT interval. There were no side effects of this treatment. In eight of the 12 patients potassium levels before the TdP were below 3.5 meq/liter; magnesium levels were available in eight patients before TdP, and were normal in all. Five additional patients with polymorphous ventricular tachycardia but normal QT intervals (non-TdP patients) received two to three boluses of MgSO4. This treatment was ineffective in all, but they responded to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy. Thus, MgSO4 is a very effective and safe treatment for TdP, and its application is rapid and simple. Its use is therefore recommended as the first line of therapy for TdP.\r"

The Hering-Breuer reflex was evaluated with the use of the ratio of apnea duration after lung inflation to the preceding expiratory time (dT). Phasic afferent activity was stopped in anesthetized, paralyzed dogs by constant-flow ventilation (CFV), a technique that removes cyclic changes in lung volume. During normocapnic (PaCO2 = 36.4 +/- 1.1 mm Hg) spontaneous breathing, there was a wide variability in HR response, with a mean delta HR/delta SaO2 (+/- SE) of 0.62 +/- 0.27 beats/min/% (values greater than 0 indicate a tachycardiac response). There was a good correlation between delta HR/delta SaO2 and dT (r = .79). Mean delta HR/delta SaO2 for the combined normocapnic and hypercapnic studies during CFV was lower (-1.32 +/- 0.19 bpm/%) than that during spontaneous breathing (0.23 +/- 0.19, p less than .0001). We suggest that the HR response to hypoxemia is strongly related to the strength of the Hering-Breuer reflex, which may explain the large interdog variability in HR responses.\r"

  ".U": "88109894\r", 
  ".W": "The usefulness of digitized echocardiographic borders in quantitative regional left ventricular function analysis has been limited by the wide reported range for normal wall motion with this technique. We postulated that random error in endocardial border positioning is a major cause of this limitation. To test this hypothesis, we traced the endocardial borders field by field from 17 complete echocardiographic cycles in six dogs. These cycles showed a great deal of random movement, with each endocardial point reversing its motion an average of 18.5 times per cardiac cycle. Spatiotemporal Fourier analysis of these sequences demonstrated that most of the valid information on endocardial motion was contained in the first four temporal harmonics and the first seven spatial harmonics and that beyond these points the Fourier transform has the spectral characteristics of noise. Reconstruction of these 17 cycles eliminating all Fourier components above the sixth temporal and eighth spatial harmonics reduced the mean number of endocardial reversals per cycle to 2.3 (p less than .00001). To derive the optimal temporal and spatial cutoffs, we compared reconstructions of each of the 17 cycles with three M mode echocardiograms obtained simultaneously with the cross-sectional images. Fourier cutoffs were varied between two and 20 harmonics and demonstrated that the optimal temporal cutoff was 5.5 harmonics and optimal spatial cutoff 6.9. With optimal filtering, the correlation between ventricular diameter derived from the M mode and from the cross-sectional images was r = .965, compared with .877 for the M mode vs unfiltered cross-sectional data (p less than .0001). We conclude that two-dimensional filtered Fourier reconstruction significantly improves the accuracy of traced echocardiographic borders. This technique should be useful in the postprocessing of endocardial borders extracted by automated edge detection schemes and should also be applicable to cardiac images derived from modalities other than echocardiography.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation at two ventricular sites during basic rhythm as a means of preventing the induction of ventricular arrhythmias in the postinfarction heart was investigated. Isochronal maps of ventricular epicardial activation from dogs were analyzed 4 days after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Activation patterns were obtained by use of a computerized data acquisition system recording from 62 sites. Effective refractoriness and conduction time during basic paced rhythm (S1) for each site were summed to construct isochronal maps of recovery time. The patterns of recovery time on the heart were eccentrically layered, with a narrow zone of differentially prolonged recovery time along one border of the infarct. The formation of an arc of functional conduction block after premature stimulation (S2) was correlated with regions of differentially prolonged recovery time (59 +/- 30 msec, mean +/- SD) between recording sites spaced 5 to 10 mm apart. The recovery time difference between sites that did not block (17 +/- 14 msec) was significantly shorter. The spatial distribution of recovery time on the heart could be modified by application of stimuli at two sites during the basic rhythm. Reentry was prevented by appropriate placement of the secondary site in the ischemic zone and the temporal sequencing of the paired stimuli. Stimulation at the secondary site \"peeled back\" refractoriness in the ischemic zone. Prevention of reentry was a result of either: (1) a shift in the arc of conduction block toward the ischemic zone, (2) a reduction in the extent of the continuous arc, (3) early activation of regions distal to the arc, or (4) a combination of the above. In two dogs, the arc of block was abolished entirely after dual stimulation. This report illustrates the criteria for effective prevention of reentry, applied to a well-described verifiable model of reentrant activation.\r"

Dogs in this \"late\" infarct group were compared with a group of 24 dogs with \"early\" healed infarcts (2 to 24 weeks old). With signal-averaging techniques body surface potentials were recorded during sinus rhythm. After thoracotomy epicardial electrograms were recorded from 45 standardized sites within the infarcted region and characteristics of selected electrograms were compared with anatomic features of underlying myocardium. Epicardial recordings from the late infarct group demonstrated earlier local activation (p less than .001) and shorter electrogram duration (p less than .001) when compared with recordings from the early infarct group. There was less temporal dispersion of activation and electrogram duration among the 45 sites in dogs with late infarcts as measured by respective coefficients of variance (p = .007 and less than .001). With programmed stimulation six dogs in the late and eight in the early infarct group exhibited inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia. Mean cycle length of the tachycardia in dogs with late infarcts was significantly shorter (p = .035). Late potentials were notably less prominent in dogs in the late infarct group with ventricular tachycardia than in dogs in the early infarct group. Fewer abnormal electrophysiologic characteristics of late infarcts coincided with relatively less scar in the underlying myocardium. Moreover, the strength of electrophysiologic-anatomic correlations differed in late as opposed to early infarcts. The latter findings suggest long-term evolution of infarct anatomy. We conclude that a substrate for reentrant tachycardia is present in dogs 4 to 6 years after reperfused infarction. Conduction characteristics are less abnormal in these late healed infarcts and are associated with a shorter ventricular tachycardia cycle length and less pronounced late potentials on the body surface.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the essential mechanism of increased systolic wall motion, i.e., hyperkinesis, in a nonischemic region (NIR) during acute ischemia, we simultaneously evaluated global and regional function of the excised, cross-circulated canine left ventricle connected to a volume servo pump before and after coronary occlusion. Regional areas were determined with pairs of orthogonal subendocardial sonomicrometers in the ischemic region (IR) and NIR. After coronary occlusion with left ventricular end-diastolic and stroke volumes kept constant, the amount of systolic area shrinkage (delta A) in NIR increased by 33 +/- 41% (p less than .05), despite a decrease in end-diastolic regional area by 3 +/- 4% (p less than .05). Regional work obtained from the wall tension-regional area (T-A) loop in NIR decreased by 50 +/- 24% due to a similar decrease in afterload despite the presence of hyperkinesis, indicating regional systolic unloading. When left ventricular end-diastolic volume was subsequently increased with a constant stroke volume, delta A in NIR increased at the expense of a further decrease in delta A in IR. The end-systolic T-A relationship in NIR remained unchanged, whereas that in IR markedly shifted rightward, suggesting that the contractile state of NIR was constant. These results indicate that hyperkinesis in NIR during acute ischemia can occur without a utilization of the Frank-Starling mechanism or an enhancement of regional contractile state, and that the essential mechanism of this phenomenon is regional afterload reduction due to an intraventricular mechanical interaction between IR and NIR.\r"

Influence of physiologic changes in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, preload, and inotropic state were studied in 17 anesthetized open-chest dogs. Heart rate was changed with atrial pacing/ULFS'49 (a selective bradycardiac agent). Mean arterial pressure was varied with aortic constriction/nitroprusside, preload was altered with nitroglycerin/volume infusion, and inotropic states were altered with dobutamine (10 microns/kg)/esmolol (100 microns/kg). IBR5, an optimum weighted frequency average (4 to 6.8 MHz) of the squared envelope of diffraction corrected for absolute backscatter, and the Fourier coefficient of amplitude modulation (FAM), an index of cardiac cycle-dependent variation, were measured from six sequential electrocardiographically gated intervals throughout the cardiac cycle. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, preload, and inotropic state did not significantly affect IBR5. FAM increased from 3.5 +/- 0.3 dB (mean +/- SEM) to 7.0 +/- 0.4 dB (p less than .01) at a heart rate of 120 beats/min, and decreased to 3.9 +/- 0.4 at a heart rate of 160 beats/min. No change in FAM was noted with a rise (70 +/- 12 to 45 +/- 10 mmHg) in mean arterial pressure or preload (an increase or decrease in diastolic segment length of +/- 10% from the baseline). Dobutamine produced a significant increase in left ventricular dP/dt (2600 +/- 200 to 3475 +/- 275 mm Hg) and FAM (3.4 +/- 0.1 to 6.4; p less than .01). Esmolol significantly reduced left ventricular dP/dt (2600 +/- 200 to 2000 +/- 175 mm Hg, p less than .05) and FAM (3.4 +/- 0.01 to 6.4 +/- 0.1; p less than .01). We conclude that IBR5 is independent of heart rate, mean arterial pressure, preload, and inotropic state. Cardiac cycle-dependent amplitude modulation follows changes in cardiac contraction.\r"

The rods are interlocked by means of devices for transverse traction (DTTs), rectangular constructs with multiple vertebral grips, the stability of which allows suppression of any postoperative external support. Initially designed to treat scoliosis, this instrumentation design allows mobilization of the vertebrae located at the apex of the curve and obtains a three-dimensional correction. Correction of the areas of the most important structural deformation can also be obtained at the level of the end vertebrae, without any need to resort to an important distraction force. The technique varies according to the various types of curvatures. Approximately 250 patients were operated upon from 1983 to 1985. In idiopathic scoliotic curvatures, the mean percentage of correction was 66%. An important improvement of the associated sagittal deformations and of the apical derotation was observed in flexible curves. In paralytic curves, particularly with a pelvic obliquity, the percentage of correction of the frontal deformation is 77%. All of the spine patients were ambulatory in the first postoperative week, without any external support, and returned to their school or family activities. In 43 patients with follow-up periods longer than two years, there were no technical errors in 38. The final angular loss of correction was less than 2 degrees in the error-free group.\r"

The surgeon treating tumorous conditions of the spine must be aware that, to date, the treatment is palliative only. The goals of the surgery and treatment are to reduce pain, preserve or improve neurologic function, and allow early mobilization. Survival overall averaged 9.1 months. Of the 14 patients who had anterior decompression alone, average survival time was 9.9 months. The 14 patients who had posterior procedures had an average survival time of 11.9 months. Five patients treated with combined anterior and posterior procedures survived 9.6 months. Fifteen patients with multiple-level spinal involvement survived 7.9 months, compared with 12.9 months for the 18 patients with single-level spinal involvement. Aggressive surgical treatment definitely improves the quality of life of patients with cord compression or unstable spinal segments secondary to bony destruction. An aggressive approach is indicated because it permits most patients to spend the remainder of their lives relatively pain-free and with intact spinal cord function.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically, implant failure is often the result of fatigue from continuous cyclic loading. Because of the inadequacies of long-run cyclic testing, fatigue susceptibility of implants was investigated by means of strain measurements and stress analysis under physiologic loads. The implants were equipped with strain gauges during load-deformation testing, and the tensile stress (the component of stress-producing fatigue failure in metals) was calculated for that site on the implant. For metals most often implanted for spinal surgery, such as stainless steel and chrome-cobalt alloys, a stress exists, known as the endurance limit, below which failure will not occur, even if cycled indefinitely. By calculating the tensile stresses in an implant and relating them to the endurance limit, the implant's susceptibility to fatigue can be determined at the site of stress analysis without formal cyclic load testing.\r"

The specimens were axially loaded with and without a posterior tether created using Zielke instrumentation. Lateral deflection and axial rotation were monitored roentgenographically. The vertebrae of tethered spines showed increased rotation in the direction associated with idiopathic scoliosis. The spinous processes moved toward the concavity at the apex of the induced lateral curve. Conversely, untethered spines either exhibited little rotation or rotated in the opposite direction; the spinous processes moved toward the convexity of the curve. Rotations toward the convexity occur in rotational kyphosis. Thus the hypothesis that idiopathic scoliosis is a rotational lordosis is substantiated; the characteristic rotation can be explained with the aid of a geometric model.\r"

The large-diameter cancellous screws should penetrate the opposite cortex. Existing bone plates are inadequate, because they are too narrow and do not allow positioning of more than two screws in each vertebra. The Biomedical Engineering Department of the National Research Council of Canada designed and tested the plate described in this article, with particular attention to providing smooth surfaces to prevent vascular complications. Three lengths of plates have been developed and are used in the area from T11 to L5, with a specific tapered plate for the L5 area to prevent contact with the overlying iliac vessels. This device should be used for stabilization following corpectomy for tumor, decompression of burst fractures, severe disc degeneration, pseudarthrosis, and the multiply operated back.\r"

  ".U": "88110158\r", 
  ".W": "In the last two decades, the concept of spinal stenosis and its treatment by surgical decompression has been widely accepted. Complications such as olisthy, disc rupture, facet fracture, and intractable back pain began to appear postoperatively, suggesting instability as their cause. A retrospective study of 344 patients treated surgically for lumbar stenosis revealed a 17% reoperation rate for complications resulting from obvious or suspected instability. Sixteen cases of postdecompression olisthy, 14 cases of fresh disc herniation, and 27 cases of intractable back pain required further surgery. Preoperative indicators of potential instability are degenerated discs as evidenced by traction spurs or diminished disc height, olisthy, and scoliosis or asymmetrically narrowed discs. Total facetectomy and pars excision at surgery destabilize the spine and must be added to the preoperative risk factors for instability. Calcified annulus, capsule and ligamentum flavum, or complete disc resorption may offer some protection from postoperative instability. The level of instability may be preselected by the proximity to the intercrestal line. It is recommended that during surgical decompression for spinal stenosis, the posterior elements be spared as much as possible to avoid instability after surgery. Factors suggesting instability noted preoperatively or decompression which produces instability suggest that fusion should be combined with decompression. Spinal fusion is the treatment for postoperative instability.\r"

All hips with less than 34% of the remaining posterior acetabulum were unstable. Hips with greater than 55% were stable. Between these values, hips were either stable or unstable. A statistical analysis demonstrated highly significant differences in the average remaining posterior acetabulum between the stable and unstable group. These findings were based on a review of 26 patients with posterior fracture dislocations of the hip (Epstein Type I-IV injuries) combined with CT scan analysis. The clinical status of hip stability was correlated with the Acetabular Fracture Index, and this provided the basis for the study. A simple linear measurement of the remaining posterior acetabulum on CT (the Approximate Acetabular Fracture Index) can be done easily by a physician, and this closely approximates the true remaining acetabular arc. Seven of ten unstable hips in 31 Epstein Type I-V patients showed femoral head subluxation of 0.5 mm or more on CT scan, whereas none of the 21 stable hips had demonstrable subluxation. Risk analysis provided a means of predicting hip stability for individual patients.\r"

  ".W": "In current practice most primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) are performed without trochanteric osteotomy. The superior exposure afforded by trochanteric osteotomy, however, can be valuable in revision total hip surgery. Between 1969 and 1983, 188 revisions in 177 patients were carried out with osteotomy of the greater trochanter. Ninety-one percent were reattached with a three- or four-wire method. Sixty-one percent of the trochanters (N = 114) were advanced to the lateral cortex. Supplemental trochanteric mesh was used in 75% of the revisions (141 hips). Its use is now routine for all revisions. Most patients (N = 137) were permitted to ambulate within five days, using a walker or two crutches, bearing partial weight on the operative hip. Ninety-seven percent (182 of 188) of the trochanters united. Six failed to unite (3%) and eight others had delayed healing (4%). Two trochanters migrated proximally prior to union (1%). Retrospective evaluation of the initial postoperative radiographs for each patient with nonunion identified one or more technical errors in the reattachment technique. While the overall incidence of wire breakage was 27%, most (42 of 51) of these trochanters healed uneventfully. Five of the six patients with trochanteric nonunion, however, had failure of one or both vertical wires by 12 weeks after surgery. The average hip score for the patients with nonunion was 89 points (versus 57 points before surgery), indicating that the average clinical outcome in this group was not substantially comprised by trochanteric complications. In light of the improvement in surgical exposure, high rate of union of the trochanter, and limited number of complications, trochanteric osteotomy is recommended for most revision THA.\r"

The long-term consequences of the anterior cruciate insufficient knee with or without associated medial collateral ligament insufficiency was investigated in 127 consecutive patients. The effects of meniscal injury and/or meniscectomy in the presence of ligamentous insufficiency was correlated with roentgenographic observations. A scoring system was devised and found to show that anterior cruciate insufficiency naturally progresses toward degenerative osteoarthritis. Meniscectomy with and without an associated medial collateral ligament insufficiency hastens the degenerative process. Progressive functional deterioration was shown to correlate with roentgenographic evidence of degenerative changes. The ultimate success of surgical repairs and reconstructions of the anterior cruciate ligament will not be based only upon functional return to activity or objective stability, but will also depend on the procedure's ability to prevent later development of degenerative osteoarthritis.\r"

Twelve patients had surgical treatment of spinal deformity associated with other disorders or had revision surgery. The remaining 25 patients, with no prior surgery, were diagnosed as having juvenile or adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. After operation, this group of patients was routinely noted to have significant improvement in rib deformity. This is associated with the rotational correction achieved with CD instrumentation and contrasts with the minimal rib deformity correction with Harrington instrumentation documented by some workers. In this series, no rib resections have been necessary in conjunction with CD instrumentation. No postoperative external immobilization was used. Ambulation began on the second postoperative day, and patients were discharged five to seven days after operation. Gradual resumption of normal activities was allowed at six weeks, and full activities, other than contact sports, after three months.\r"

In this study rat knees were surgically immobilized in flexion and a sham operation was performed on the contralateral knees. Mechanical studies revealed that the flexion contracture increased rapidly for two weeks. The anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) were contracted and contributed to the flexion contractures. Histologic studies of the ACL showed no increase in the cellularity of the contracted ligaments. In the contracted ligaments, staining for the contractile protein actin was heavy. Previous transmission electron microscopy studies have demonstrated fibroblast cytoplasm in processes far from the visible cell body and it is hypothesized that this cytoplasm was responsible for increased actin staining away from the visible cell body. This study supports the concept that ligament fibroblasts, modulated to a form containing increased quantities of the contractile protein actin, play an active role in the contraction of ligamentous tissue.\r"

Degenerative changes of articular cartilage in the tibiofemoral joints of all knees were inversely correlated with the size of the regenerated meniscus.

  ".W": "A new internal skeletal fixation system (ISFS) for stabilizing thoracolumbar fractures and other spinal disorders was developed by Dick in Switzerland. The ISFS is a modification of the Magerl external skeletal fixation system of the spine. The Dick modification consists of a threaded rod connected by clamps to Schanz screws and is located in the vertebral pedicles on both sides of the spine. Due to a stable angle between the rod and Schanz screw, a one-point fixation above and below the diseased vertebra is sufficient. The ISFS provides a short fixation and promotes fusion. Control of lordosis, kyphosis, and rotation of the spine is possible with threaded rod distraction and compression and through manipulation of the Schanz screws held by movable clamps. The advantage of the ISFS is the ability to achieve reduction and fixation with the same instrumentation. ISFS has been used in more than 90 patients and proven most adequate for thoracolumbar fractures and other localized spinal disorders. The Harrington system and its modifications are no longer in use for these problems.\r"

The diagnosis was confirmed histologically and by X-ray diffraction. CPPD crystal deposition was found within bone, however, the articular cartilage was not involved. Other unusual features of the case include the size of the lesion, the monoarticular presentation and a peculiar discoloration of the overlying skin. The clinical presentation and radiographic features were initially consistent with a malignant process; thus the case demonstrates that CPPD arthropathy should be included in the differential diagnosis of periarticular tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The most frequent surgical treatment of thoracolumbar fractures is still the Harrington rod system despite some adverse effects, the most serious being the locking of five to seven segments. The new pedicular fixation modifications suggested by Magerl and Dick lock only two segments and give far better stability of the fractures. Used internally, the system is convenient for the patient, permitting early mobilization, often without any external support. The instrument, called the \"posterior segmental fixator\" (PSF), is used both as a reduction device and as a fixation device. The injured vertebra is grafted through the pedicle, giving security against late collapse after device removal. Twenty patients treated with this method had an average follow-up period of ten months. The primary reduction attains 88% of the calculated height of the injured vertebra, with only a few percent loss during follow-up time. Clearance of fragments in the spinal canal, diagnosed with computed tomography scan in eight patients, was successfully accomplished in all but one, with only distraction or reduction of the fragment through a limited laminotomy. The instrumentation in these cases was lateral to the dura. Nine patients with neurologic deficits improved and could walk without support or with crutches within a few months. One patient with complete paraplegia remained unchanged.\r"

  ".W": "Sacral fractures, often undiagnosed and untreated, frequently result in neurologic symptoms and deficits to the lower extremities and urinary, rectal, and sexual dysfunctions. These same neurologic problems often remain the major chronic sequelae after the more obvious pelvic trauma lesion has healed. Specific treatments aimed at neurologic problems are available and may allow the patient functional recovery. This is illustrated by anatomic observations on the sacrum in 39 cadavers showing the relationship among sacral nerve roots within their foramina. These observations were valuable for a retrospective study of 236 consecutive patients with sacral fractures in a series of 776 patients with pelvic injuries. A new classification of sacral fractures evolved from this study and provided a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the associated neurologic symptoms. The classification is based on the direction, location, and level of sacral fractures. Three different zones were identified as having characteristic clinical presentations: Zone I, the region of the ala, was occasionally associated with partial damage to the fifth lumbar root. Zone II, the region of the sacral foramina, is frequently associated with sciatica but rarely with bladder dysfunction. Zone III, the region of the central sacral canal, is frequently associated with saddle anesthesia and loss of sphincter function. Routine pelvic roentgenograms were almost useless in identifying the pathologic process in sacral injuries with neurologic symptoms. Ferguson views, tomograms, and particularly computed tomography scans were crucial for understanding these injuries. Cystometrography was most helpful in positively identifying fractures causing neurogenic bladders. Cystometrograms should be ordered routinely in Zone III injuries. Preliminary observations suggest that surgical decompression permitted significantly better neurologic recovery than nonsurgical methods.\r"

Disc degeneration predisposes to intersegmental instability and rotational strain, which result in secondary osteoarthritic change of the articular processes and segmental canal stenosis. Thirty-six patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis were treated with anterior interbody fusion (AIF) for segmental canal stenosis at the authors' hospital during 1958-1985. The surgical results of these patients reveal that AIF corrects malalignment of the lumbar spine by complete discectomy, reduces the slip and restores the disc height, and resolves nerve compression, both from the front and from behind, by enlargement of the stenosing canal. In addition, AIF has consistent and satisfactory clinical results at long-term follow-up evaluation because it resolves intersegmental instability, an important problem of degenerative spondylolisthesis. AIF is a reasonable and reliable treatment for patients younger than 60 years of age with segmental stenosis.\r"

The reproducibilities of the responses to tilting by 60 degrees, expressed as two standard deviations of the differences between responses on two occasions (mean responses in parentheses), were: cardiac output +/- 0.70 (-1.41) litre/min, heart rate +/- 7.6 (+14.7) beats/min, systolic blood pressure +/- 15.5 (+1.0), and diastolic blood pressure +/- 13.1 (+13.6) mmHg. 4.

Supine values and responses to tilting by 60 degrees were compared in subjects in four age groups between 20 and 80 years. With increasing age, the supine values of cardiac output declined and those of arterial blood pressures increased. Responses of heart rate, cardiac output and diastolic pressure declined by increasing age. These results, obtained from a healthy population, provide reference values for comparison with individuals who may have deficient postural responses.\r"

Using generalized linear models, the maximum value for breath-hold CO was estimated to occur at 23 s. Breath-hold CO after a 20 and 25 s breath-hold were similar to and significantly greater than those of less than 20 s or greater than 25 s. 3.

The two measurements were closely correlated but there was a marked difference in the change or 'boost' after smoking one cigarette. The mean relative boosts ([post value--pre value]/[pre+post]/2) for alveolar CO and carboxyhaemoglobin were 7.7% and 20.3%, while negative boosts (fall rather than the expected rise) were seen in 103 of 500 and three of 500 occasions respectively. In 140 studies a third alveolar CO reading taken 5 min later was slightly larger, but the difference was insignificant. 2. In seven subjects where the carboxyhaemoglobin level was raised by breathing a 2% CO gas mixture, the alveolar CO and carboxyhaemoglobin boosts were similar (71.7% and 75.2% respectively), and they fell sharply subsequently rather than increasing further as occurred after smoking. 3. We conclude that alveolar CO measurements give a useful estimate of carboxyhaemoglobin level if the subject has not smoked for at least half an hour but that measurements of alveolar CO boost are useless since the act of smoking interferes with alveolar sampling. We postulate that cigarette smoking induces a transient change in pulmonary gas exchange.\r"

To determine whether the metabolic changes produced by this infusion were due to the resultant alkalaemia the effect of an equimolar infusion of sodium bicarbonate was also studied. 2. The sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion reduced alanine concentration as a result of a decrease in alanine production rate and an increase in alanine metabolic clearance rate. The sodium bicarbonate infusion induced a small decrease in alanine concentration which was due to an increased metabolic clearance rate. Alanine production rate showed no change. This demonstrates that the fall in alanine concentration after a sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion is due both to a ketone-specific inhibitory effect on alanine production rate and an increased metabolic clearance rate caused by the alkalaemia. 3. Leucine concentration was increased after the ketone infusion due to a small increase in production rate and there was a small increase in the rate of leucine incorporation into protein. Alkalaemia had no effect on leucine concentration or metabolism.\r"

The effects of plasma fractions from essential hypertensive subjects (n = 14) and normotensive subjects (n = 14) on Ca2+ transport in permeabilized human neutrophils was studied using an ion-selective electrode. 2. Plasma fractions were obtained by gel filtration and contained substances with a molecular mass in the range 1000-1500 daltons. This fraction isolated from essential hypertensive subjects has been shown to increase blood pressure after intravenous injection in the rat. 3. The rate of Ca2+ uptake by permeabilized neutrophils after addition of extracellular Ca2+ was significantly accelerated during incubation of the cells with the hypertensive fraction (1049.3 +/- 807.7% vs 242.5 +/- 320.9% of the control value, mean +/- SD, P less than 0.05). 4. It is concluded that the hypertensive plasma fraction increases Ca2+ accumulation in subcellular particles, so that under excitatory conditions Ca2+ release in arterial smooth muscle might be enhanced.\r"

Skeletal muscle strength, contractile properties and radiological composition have been studied in seven morbidly obese adults (six female) before and 1 year after gastroplasty operations. The mean body weight fell from 138.3 kg (SD 25.2) to 99.7 kg (SD 23.0) (P less than 0.001). 2. The strength and contractile properties (force/frequency, relaxation rate and fatiguability) of both the adductor pollicis and quadriceps muscles were unaffected by the weight loss. 3. Computerized axial tomography scans obtained 1 year after surgery showed that the quadriceps contained an abnormally high proportion of fat. The mean fat content was 10.8% (range 3.0-30.1%) compared with 1.6% (range 0-5%) for normal muscle. Two individuals were scanned before and after surgery and the fat content of their quadriceps fell from 12.6% and 6.9% to 3.1% and 3.0%, respectively. 4. It is concluded that in obese individuals large amounts of weight can be lost, from both subcutaneous and intramuscular fat stores, without compromising either the strength or contractile properties of skeletal muscles. These results do not support the claim that skeletal muscle contractility is a sensitive indicator of changes in nutritional status.\r"

Objective measurements of the maximal voluntary strength of triceps surae and the amount and speed of customary walking have been made in 56 men and 66 women aged over 65 years, who were living independently. 2. Strength was measured using a dynamometer based upon a hydraulic system (Bourdon tube). Walking was assessed, for amount using a mechanical accelerometer (pedometer) over a week, and for speed using a self-paced test for normal walking over 100 m on the level. The reliability and validity of these methods has been described. 3. The men were significantly stronger (1128 +/- 206 vs 873 +/- 177 N) even after adjustment for body weight; their amount of walking was similar to that of women, but they walked significantly faster (4.8 +/- 0.6 vs 4.2 +/- 0.6 km/h). Men were significantly more active in leisure pursuits (as assessed by questionnaire). 4. Significant associations between strength and chosen normal walking speed were found for both sexes (r = 0.41, P less than 0.001 for men and r = 0.36, P less than 0.01 for women). The amount of walking (daily stepscore as a mean from 7 consecutive days recorded) was significantly but less strongly correlated with strength (r = 0.30, P less than 0.05) in the men only. 5. Multiple regression analysis showed that in men neither age nor amount of walking had any further effect in addition to speed, but in women age had an additional effect (multiple R = 0.48). 6. An association has been demonstrated which raises the possibility of reversing loss of muscle strength through increased daily activity.\r"

Metoclopramide did not significantly influence plasma renin activity, whereas both plasma aldosterone and plasma prolactin rose significantly. The incremental areas under the curves did not differ among controls and cirrhotic patients without and with ascites. No significant correlations between plasma prolactin and aldosterone, either under basal conditions or after metoclopramide administration, were found in either controls or patients. 3. Glomerular filtration rate did not change after metoclopramide. Renal sodium excretion in controls and cirrhotic patients without ascites was also unaffected, whereas it decreased significantly in cirrhotic patients with ascites. In the latter, renal sodium excretion was inversely correlated with plasma aldosterone both under basal conditions and after metoclopramide administration. 4. The dopaminergic control of aldosterone secretion does not appear to be significantly altered in cirrhosis. Metoclopramide administration to cirrhotic patients with ascites leads to an increase in plasma aldosterone that may enhance renal sodium retention.\r"

Injury increased the rates of glutamine production in muscle, skin and adipose tissue preparations, with muscle production accounting for over 90% of total glutamine produced by the hindlimb. 3. Injury produced decreases in the concentrations of skeletal muscle glutamine (36%, P less than 0.001), glutamate (39%, P less than 0.001), alanine (24%, P less than 0.001), pyruvate (35%, P less than 0.001), 2-oxoglutarate (51%, P less than 0.001) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (38%, P less than 0.001). The concentrations of ammonia (42%, P less than 0.001) and inosine 5'-phosphate (430%, P less than 0.001) were increased. 4. The maximal activity of glutamine synthetase was increased (22-40%, P less than 0.001) in muscles of injured rats, whereas that of glutaminase was unchanged. 5. Hindlimb blood flow decreased by approximately 15% in injured rats, which was accompanied by an enhanced net release of glutamine (80%, P less than 0.001) and alanine (44%, P less than 0.001). 6. It is concluded that there is an enhanced rate of release of both glutamine and alanine from skeletal muscle of thermally injured rats. This may be due to changes in efflux and/or increased intracellular formation of glutamine and alanine.\r"

Measurements of the rate of lithium clearance, which provides an estimate of proximal renal tubular iso-osmotic reabsorption (i.e. sodium and H2O), were used to study H2O and electrolyte reabsorption during the development of cyclosporin A (CsA) induced nephrotoxicity. 2. CsA, administered daily by gavage at 50 mg/kg body weight, produced a nephrotoxicity which was characterized by reductions in the clearance rates of creatinine, sodium and potassium, and increased glycosuria, enzymuria and urine flow rate. 3. Decreased lithium clearance rate and increased proximal iso-osmotic reabsorption accompanied significant reductions in creatinine clearance rate. Absolute proximal tubular reabsorption, however, was not affected by CsA administration. 4. Reductions in the absolute distal tubular reabsorption of sodium, potassium and H2O were also observed. 5. Alterations in renal tubular function occur early in the development of CsA nephrotoxicity as a result of both direct proximal tubulotoxicity and an effect on the afferent arteriole. 6. Measurements of the rate of lithium clearance may be a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of CsA nephrotoxicity.\r"

The tests were repeated after the inhalation of a methacholine aerosol in sufficient dosage to increase airways resistance. 2. After inhalation of methacholine there was a significant fall in mean series dead space of 31 ml (P less than 0.05), and mean multi-breath alveolar mixing efficiency fell from 68% to 36% (P less than 0.001), a fall occurring in all subjects. Mean single-breath alveolar mixing efficiency measured on the first breath of the nitrogen washout fell from 76% to 70%, but this change did not reach statistical significance (0.1 greater than P greater than 0.05). 3. In eight of the subjects, technically adequate lung scans and pulmonary function tests were obtained both before and not more than 30 min after methacholine inhalation. In seven there were obvious visible defects on the ventilation scans, and in five of these the computer-calculated underventilation score became abnormal. 4. Thus inhalation of methacholine causes maldistribution of ventilation, a fall in alveolar mixing efficiency and a fall in series dead space, presumably brought about by bronchoconstriction. The parallel component of this maldistribution of ventilation, as judged by 81mKr ventilation scanning, does not of itself seem to be sufficient to explain the fall in alveolar mixing efficiency, and therefore a degree of diffusion limitation is probably involved as well.\r"

Moderate local cooling and warming of the foot (26-36 degrees C) was induced by blowing cold or hot air. Higher ranges of temperature (38-44 degrees C) were achieved by a thermostatically controlled disc heater. 3. Skin blood flow was measured before and during each change in local skin temperature using a laser Doppler flowmeter with the foot maintained at heart level, and placed passively 50 cm below the heart. Blood flow was measured in two skin areas: (i) the dorsum on the foot, where arteriovenous anastomoses are absent, and (ii) the pulp of the big toe, where these anastomoses are relatively numerous. 4. It was found that within the physiological temperature range of 26-36 degrees C the normal postural fall in foot skin blood flow was preserved, whereas it was markedly attenuated or totally abolished at higher temperatures (38-44 degrees C). The pattern of response was quite similar in areas having or lacking arteriovenous anastomoses. 5. It is suggested that the failure of postural vasoconstriction observed at the higher skin temperatures might contribute to some of the problems of cardiovascular adaptations seen in a hot environment.\r"

The opioid peptide enkephalin, which has anti-secretory action in the small intestine, is also contained in nerves in the gall-bladder wall. 2. In experimental cholecystitis, there is active fluid secretion by the epithelial cells into the gall-bladder lumen, when the intraluminal hydrostatic pressure is low. This fluid secretion to the lumen was abolished by intravenous administration of enkephalin, an effect that was blocked by naloxone pretreatment. The flux of fluid into the lumen was also abolished when the intraluminal hydrostatic pressure was raised to the level initially observed in the inflamed and obstructed gall bladder. Fluid absorption in the normal gall bladder was unaffected by enkephalin. 3. In experimental cholecystitis, naloxone, used as a non-specific antagonist of opiate action, did not affect the gall-bladder mucosal fluid transport observed at a low intraluminal hydrostatic pressure, but it induced fluid secretion when this pressure was high. 4. It is suggested that a raised intraluminal hydrostatic pressure in experimental cholecystitis, which distends the gall bladder, releases endogenous opioids that inhibit active fluid secretion by the gall-bladder epithelial cells. This response may represent a defence mechanism that could be present also in the gastrointestinal tract. In the obstructed and inflamed gall bladder it may prevent progressive distension, ischaemia and perforation of the wall.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating phospholipase A2 (PLA2) has been recognized as a mediator of circulatory collapse in experimental endotoxic shock. To assess the role of serum PLA2 in septic shock in man, we determined serum PLA2 profiles in a prospective study in 12 patients with septic shock. During the hypotensive phase of sepsis, serum PLA2 levels were consistently elevated as high as 33,428 U/ml (normal range 115 +/- 12 [SE]; n = 101). In all 12 patients, PLA2 levels correlated directly with the magnitude and duration of circulatory collapse (p less than .001), with a progressive fall of serum PLA2 levels during convalescence. In contrast, serum PLA2 levels in patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to myocardial infarction remained low. In pancreatitis, PLA2 levels paralleled fluctuations of serum amylase and lipase, whereas in septic shock without pancreatic involvement, PLA2 changes were discordant with changes in pancreatic enzymes. As well, septic shock serum PLA2 failed to crossreact by radioimmunoassay with antiserum against human pancreatic PLA2. These data are consistent with an extrapancreatic source of intravascular PLA2 release during sepsis. Since endogenous serum PLA2 levels correlate directly with the magnitude of hypotension in both experimental endotoxic shock and clinical septic shock, and since parenteral administration of purified exogenous PLA2 reproduces hypotension in experimental models, we conclude that high levels of intravascular PLA2 may contribute similarly to the circulatory collapse in septic shock in man.\r"

The only major organizational change in the postintensivist period was the organization and implementation of a daytime ICU team. Case mix variables, including sex; medical/surgical, emergency/elective, and diagnostic distributions; and nursing hours/patient day, were equivalent in the pre-intensivist and postintensivist samples. After the intensivist's arrival, there was a significant decrease in admissions with very low severity of illness (Physiologic Stability Index less than 4; 52% vs. 34%; p less than .05) and a significant decrease in bed utilization by patients who received only monitoring services (27% vs. 17% of bed days; p less than .001). The severity of the illness-adjusted ICU mortality rate was significantly higher in the pre-intensivist period than in the postintensivist period (weighted mean mortality difference 5.3 +/- 2.6%; p less than .05). The incidence of both therapeutic and monitoring modalities increased in the postintensivist period. These results indicate that a pediatric intensivist can improve mortality rates and efficiency of bed utilization in the pediatric ICU.\r"

Energy production rates were higher than those predicted by the Harris-Benedict formula both in absolute value (1516 +/- 61 vs. 1387 +/- 49 kcal/day, p less than .05) and when normalized by body weight (BW; 23.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 21.7 +/- 0.5 kcal/day.kg BW, p less than .01) or by lean body mass (LBM; 32.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 30.2 +/- 0.9 kcal/day.kg LBM, p less than .01). Furthermore, surgical patients had higher energy production rates than those measured in 22 overnight fasted, resting healthy subjects matched for age, sex, and body size (23.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 21.8 +/- 0.6 kcal/day.kg BW, p less than .05). In both the patients and the control group, measured energy production bore a direct relation to LBM. We conclude that the early postoperative period of uncomplicated surgery is associated with a small (about 7%) but consistent increase in energy metabolism above the level observed in the overnight fasted, resting healthy individual. This increase appears to be an effect of surgery itself, and is not predicted by Harris-Benedict equations.\r"

Along with antibiotics and control of metabolic derangements, standard therapy involves monitoring and maintaining numerous cardiorespiratory variables. From 1980 to 1985, 39 children with meningococcal shock were treated in our pediatric ICU. We obtained full hemodynamic monitoring in 18 (12 survivors, six nonsurvivors). Two hemodynamic patterns were observed: hypovolemia and cardiac failure. Early death was generally related to refractory hypovolemia, probably secondary to severe capillary leak. Survival usually occurred when noticeable cardiac failure was controlled with early use of catecholamines and judicious fluid management. Because cardiac failure only slowly recovered, a therapeutic approach that aims not at normal variables but, rather, at survival variables seems appropriate.\r"

Although correlations between entropy and age and heart rate (HR) were significant (p less than .01), the additional explained variance was minimal. The groups were compared for sex, age, mean HR, past medical history and medications taken and were found to be statistically similar. In our patients without significant dysrhythmias on admission, HRV appeared to be an index for significant cardiac events, and thus may prove to be a useful tool in clinical situations where other objective decision criteria are lacking.\r"

Peritoneal lavage is useful in reversing early-phase systemic circulatory effects mediated by toxins in the ascitic fluid, but does not modify the underlying pancreatitis. When pancreatitis progresses to pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis, the ultimate outcome is determined by a) the amount of necrosis, b) the extent of extrapancreatic necrosis, and c) bacterial contamination of necrosis. The amount of pancreatic regional necrosis that can be safely observed for healing is unknown; large collections tend to become infected secondarily and thus should be evacuated. Computed tomographic scanning is the best current means of detecting pancreatic necrosis and abscesses. Only percutaneous aspiration can reliably differentiate sterile from infected collections. As sepsis is the most common cause of death in acute pancreatitis, adequate surgical drainage is essential, while antibiotic therapy is only adjunctive. Aggressive treatment directed at the two principal causes of death, early-phase shock and late-phase sepsis, should reduce mortality to about 1% overall and to about 5% in cases complicated by regional necrosis and sepsis.\r"

Seven patients with angiographically proven massive acute pulmonary embolism were treated. Streptokinase, 10,000-20,000 units/hour, was administered directly into the left or right pulmonary artery for 9 to 24 hours. Heparin was administered concurrently. The number of unperfused segments of the infused lung shown on the lung scan decreased from 5 +/- 2 to 2 +/- 1 after 12-24 hours (p less than .01). No change was shown in the contralateral lung. The angiographic index of severity score in the infused lung decreased from 16 +/- 1 to 9 +/- 4 (p less than .01). The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood improved within four hours. In spite of the low doses of streptokinase, however, two major bleeding episodes occurred that required blood transfusion. In conclusion, low dose intrapulmonary streptokinase, combined with intravenous heparin, may provide a therapeutic option in patients with life-threatening massive acute pulmonary embolism in whom full dose lytic therapy may be hazardous, although even low dose lytic therapy was associated with risk.\r"

Demographic data, personal, medical, smoking and occupational histories were obtained by personal interview. We skin tested these individuals with a standard battery of seven common allergens and a diluent control. Fewer patients (35.8 percent) than control subjects (58.4 percent) responded with one or more positive skin reactions (p less than .005). There was no significant difference between patients (27.8 percent) and control subjects (37.2 percent) responding to more than one allergen. Fewer of the 38 sibling-matched patients had one or more positive skin tests (23.7 percent) than did their siblings (55.3 percent) (p less than .01). There were fewer patients with greater than one positive skin test (15.8 percent) than sibling control subjects (42.1 percent) (p less than .025). There were no differences in smoking pack-years between patients and siblings. Historic evidence of allergy was greater in both control groups compared to their matched cancer groups; p less than .05 for community controls, p less than .005 for sibling control subjects. These findings raise the possibility that atopy, by either immunologic or nonimmunologic means, protects against development of lung cancer, or alternately, that lung cancer affects immunologic status as gauged by (type 1) skin sensitivity.\r"

Only patients with increased RVED dimension (5/25; 20 percent) required tricuspid valvular surgery for prolonged fever or progressive right-sided heart failure (p less than 0.05 vs patients with normal RVED dimension). Tricuspid vegetations greater than 1.0 cm identified a subset of patients at increased risk for developing clinical right-sided heart failure during the active or convalescent phase of endocarditis (p less than 0.02 vs patients with tricuspid vegetations less than 1.0 cm). An unexpectedly high prevalence of asymptomatic prolapse of the mitral valve was observed in this population (23 of 53 episodes; 43 percent). Detection of tricuspid vegetations in patients with endocarditis due to S aureus is not a primary indication for early surgery, but identifies patients more likely to exhibit short-term and long-term complications of their infection.\r"

All patients received prior (59 patients) and/or concurrent (13 patients) external beam irradiation to \"tolerance\" and were not candidates for surgery. Forty of these patients also received neodymium-YAG laser treatment prior to brachytherapy in a planned combined approach to provide immediate symptomatic relief and facilitate catheter placement. A dose of 3,000 cGy is prescribed to 5 mm and 10 mm radii over 20-40 hours in the bronchus and trachea, respectively. Of 59 patients treated with palliative intent, 40 patients (68 percent) have had follow-up bronchoscopy, 18 patients have had clinical follow-up only, and one patient was lost to follow-up. Of 40 patients examined by bronchoscope in follow-up, 24 (60 percent) responded, eight were stable, and eight progressed. Lack of progression after prior external beam radiation for periods of greater than 12 months, six-12 months and less than six months yielded response rates to brachytherapy in 83 percent, 50 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Most patients with clinical follow-up only expired at early intervals with airway palliation from extra-airway disease progression. Four of five patients treated with curative intent are disease-free at a median of 16 months. Eleven patients have experienced fistula and/or hemorrhage, of which seven instances (11 percent of all patients) appear to be treatment-induced. This brachytherapy technique is simple, well tolerated, and convenient for the patient providing airway palliation in the significant majority of patients with acceptable risk.\r"

  ".W": "Humification of oxygen prior to administration by nasal cannula is an expensive practice which has been justified on the basis that it improves the comfort of patients receiving supplemental oxygen therapy. Routine humidification of low-flow oxygen (less than or equal to 4 L/min) delivered by nasal cannula has recently been challenged based on theoretic grounds and on the results of a clinical study. Nevertheless, we found, in a telephone survey of medium-sized American hospitals, that routine humidification of nasal cannula oxygen remains a common practice. To further evaluate the necessity of oxygen humidification, we prospectively evaluated, on a daily basis, the subjective complaints of consecutive patients in our institution who were ordered to receive nasal oxygen at relatively high flow rates (5 L/min). Of the 185 patients evaluated over a period of three wintertime months, 99 received humidified oxygen and 86 received dry oxygen. Complaints, especially dry nose and dry throat (42.9 percent and 43.9 percent of the daily interviews, respectively) were common in both groups, but the symptoms were relatively mild and did not increase significantly when oxygen was administered without prior humidification. We conclude that routine humidification of oxygen for administration by nasal cannula is not justifiable, and that cessation of this practice would result in significant reductions in both time and material costs in respiratory care.\r"

  ".W": "The total lung capacity (TLC) is frequently used as a measure of respiratory impairment in patients with asbestosis. Because asbestosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exert opposite effects on the TLC, it may be an insensitive measure of impairment in patients with both abnormalities. To assess this, we compared asbestos-exposed patients with functional evidence of COPD and radiographic evidence of interstitial fibrosis (group 1) to those with interstitial fibrosis alone (group 2). Despite the two groups being comparable in degree of radiographic \"fibrosis,\" no case of restrictive impairment (reduced TLC) was identified among those with both interstitial fibrosis and COPD (group 1), compared to 33 percent of those with interstitial fibrosis alone (group 2). In addition, those patients with both interstitial fibrosis and COPD, compared to those with interstitial fibrosis alone, were found to have greater impairment as measured by alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and diffusing capacity. We conclude that the TLC is an insensitive measure of impairment due to asbestosis in patients with the common setting of coexistent asbestosis and COPD.\r"

This has allowed us to clear the overlapping for the ADAp activity among tuberculous patients (two cases of lupus and three cases of malignant effusions) in our series. The overlap in the Lp/Ls ratio among tuberculous patients, two malignant, and two parapneumonic uncomplicated cases was also cleared. Fixing the ADAp values at 33 U and the Lp/Ls ratio at 1.2, the tuberculous pleural effusion cases were differentiated from the nontuberculous with a sensibility, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and safety diagnosis of 100 percent. It has been proven that there is a good correlation between ADAp and Lp/Ls ratio (r = 0.717) and the ADAp and Lp (r = 0.660).\r"

Tuberculous involvement was limited to the lower lung field in seven out of 16 patients with concomitant parenchymal lesions. The remaining nine patients had pulmonary tuberculosis involving the upper lobes. Consolidation was the most common form of pulmonary lesion. A diagnosis was made on the basis of sputum examination in nine patients; however, peripheral lymph node examination yielded a higher diagnostic rate (90 percent). Endobronchial involvement was proved by bronchoscopy in 12 of 16 patients. In three instances, the final diagnosis could be documented after mediastinoscopy or exploratory thoracotomy.\r"

The overall fatality rate was 36.6 percent. The identification of a \"high-risk\" microorganism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, and other Gram-negative bacilli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida sp, Aspergillus sp, and episodes of polymicrobial pneumonia), bilateral involvement on chest x-ray examination, the presence of respiratory failure, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, and age older than 60 years or an underlying condition ultimately or rapidly fatal were those factors selected by a stepforward logistic regression analysis as independently worsening the prognosis. A series of variables frequently quoted as predisposing to NP was determined to be either present or absent in the same 120 cases of NP and in an equal number of randomly selected control subjects. After adjusting for confounding, factors significantly predisposing to NP were tracheal intubation, depressed level of consciousness, underlying chronic lung disease, thoracic or upper abdominal surgery, prior episode of a large volume aspiration, and age older than 70 years. Since some of the factors influencing the risk or the prognosis of NP are amenable to medical intervention, a percentage of NP might be prevented and its prognosis can be improved.\r"

In 13 of these patients, the resting electrocardiogram was normal and in nine it showed pre-excitation. Of the 13 patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram, supraventricular tachycardia was initiated in all. Seven patients had a ventricular-to-atrial interval greater than 70 ms during supraventricular tachycardia suggesting the presence of a concealed accessory pathway, and six patients had a ventricular-to-atrial interval less than 70 ms during supraventricular tachycardia suggesting reentry within the atrioventricular node. Supraventricular tachycardia was initiated in four of nine patients with pre-excitation on the resting electrocardiogram and the accessory pathway was confirmed by a ventricular-to-atrial interval of greater than 70 ms during supraventricular tachycardia in these four patients. Atrial fibrillation was initiated in eight of the nine patients with pre-excitation on the resting electrocardiogram and the shortest R-R interval during atrial fibrillation was measured. The response to therapy was assessed in seven of these nine patients by further measurement of the shortest R-R interval during atrial fibrillation following treatment. Esophageal stimulation and recording provides a simple noninvasive procedure which can be utilized as a screening technique to identify patients with intranodal reentry and those with reentry utilizing an accessory pathway. Sequential assessment of the response to therapy, especially in those patients with pre-excitation, is of considerable value in treatment.\r"

Cardiac causes accounted for 54 percent of deaths; neurologic causes, 14 percent of deaths; other diseases, 9 percent; and in 23 percent, cause of death was unknown. Although most sudden deaths are considered unpredictable, preceding symptoms were reported in more than one half of the patients. We found that syncope had occurred in 23 percent of cases, chest pain in 11 percent, and febrile disease in 16 percent. Exercise-associated syncope occurred in 16 percent and exercise-associated death occurred in most (86 percent) of those cases. Diagnosis at the time of the preceding symptoms failed to predict the fatal diseases in most cases. Our report points out the high incidence of syncope prior death in young soldiers with sudden death. Although further prospective controlled studies are needed in order to confirm that impression, we suggest that the possibility of syncope followed by sudden death should be kept in mind while evaluating young patients presenting with exercise-associated syncope.\r"

He was known to have had sinus bradycardia with first-degree atrioventricular block for eight years and a type 1 second-degree block five years prior to death. A permanent pacemaker had been inserted, and apparently the patient was then in good health and maintained his jogging program until he died suddenly. The conduction system revealed an atrioventricular node situated more to the left of the atrial septum than usual, which made tenuous connection with the surrounding atria due to marked fatty infiltration. The atrioventricular node as it joined the left-sided His bundle revealed fatty metamorphosis, fibrosis, disarray of myocardial fibers, and mononuclear cell infiltration. The right bundle branch was intramyocardial and fibrosed throughout. Increased aging changes of the left side of the septum with arteriolosclerosis and patchy fibrosis were present. This is the first case in which the atrioventricular node was more to the left side of the atrial septum with fatty separation of the node from the surrounding atrial musculature, with myocardial disarray of the nodal-His bundle junction. Although congenital abnormality of the conduction system may remain silent without symptoms for a long time, it should be kept in mind that sudden death may occur sooner or later in some susceptible individuals.\r"

Whether this weakness results from a neuropathic or myopathic process has not been established. Thirty patients with SLE were screened for the presence of inspiratory muscle (IM) weakness. Detailed studies were performed in nine with IM weakness. All nine were found to have diaphragmatic weakness (mean +/- SD, maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure 50 +/- 12 cmH2O). Phrenic nerve latencies, evaluated using transcutaneous stimulation, were normal in all individuals excluding a demyelinating neuropathy. Compound diaphragm action potential (CDAP) with phrenic nerve stimulation was normal in six of these nine patients. Reduced CDAP in three of nine patients was consistent either with axonal degeneration of the phrenic nerve or diaphragm myopathy. Nerve conduction and electromyographic studies on peripheral nerves and muscles respectively failed to demonstrate an associated generalized neuropathy or myopathy. We conclude that diaphragmatic weakness in patients with SLE is both common and is very unlikely to be caused by a phrenic neuropathy.\r"

We collected immunologic studies at the initial visit, performed sequential pulmonary function studies and obtained chest radiographs. After compensating for the normal changes expected with increasing age, we found the declines in FVC, FEV1, and Dsb in the symptomatic group were nearly four times greater than expected. There was no significant difference in the decline of pulmonary function between asymptomatic subjects and the normal predicted declines with increasing age.

Standing height in adults was 49.6 +/- 3.2 (SD) inches with a sitting/standing height ratio of 0.66 (normal 0.52-0.53). Despite extremely short stature, only AP chest diameters in males were smaller than control subjects of similar age. The following equations were derived for forced vital capacity (FVC): males (under 25 years), FVC(L) = -3.56 + 0.162 X sitting height (in) + 0.067 X age (yrs); males (over 25 years), FVC(L) = -0.73 + 0.162 X sitting height (in) -0.047 X age (yrs); females (under 20 years), FVC(L) = -3.56 + 0.150 X sitting height (in) + 0.067 X age (yrs); females (over 20 years), FVC(L) = -1.92 + 0.150 X sitting height (in) -0.016 X age (years). Similar prediction equations were derived for FEV1 and FEF25-75%: FEV1/FVC % was 84.2 (+/- 6.5) for females and 88.0 (+/- 6.5) for males. We also compared the observed FVC measurements to values calculated using standing heights derived from the subject's sitting height, assuming a normal body proportion. The observed vital capacity in achondroplasia was only 67.6 (+/- 19.2) percent of that predicted for normally proportioned females and 72.4 (+/- 13.6) percent for males, suggesting reduced vital capacity in achondroplasia, due to reduced chest wall compliance or abnormal lung growth.\r"

Seizure-induced elevations from baseline of systemic and pulmonary vascular pressures were identical in the two groups both in height and duration. In animals with left atrial balloon inflation prior to seizures, however, the peak pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressures were the sum of baseline elevation (induced by left atrial balloon inflation) and the seizure-induced pressure elevation. Accordingly, the resultant pulmonary vascular pressure and resultant pulmonary lymph flow elevations, were substantially greater in these animals with elevation in baseline pulmonary vascular pressures. Therefore, patients with pulmonary vascular hypertension are at greater risk for pulmonary edema during seizures.\r"

Overall, a minimum of $21,724 was saved over five months by shifting these long-term ventilator patients from the ICU to the NIMU while quality of medical care remained or exceeded accepted standards. We conclude that alternative health care delivery systems such as the NIMU need to be investigated as safe, cost-reducing substitutes for selected ICU patients to prevent loss of quality medical care in the financial backlash of the present Medicare prospective payment schedule.\r"

Preoperative evaluation including physical examination, computed tomography of the abdomen, full lung tomography or chest-computed tomography, and radionuclide bone scanning identified extrahepatic metastases, most commonly in the lung, in 25 of 132 patients with purported isolated liver metastases. Of 107 patients with negative staging evaluations, intra-abdominal extrahepatic metastases were found in 26 percent (28 of 107) at laparotomy, most commonly in portal and celiac lymph nodes. The presence of extrahepatic disease correlated with greater than 25 percent hepatic replacement by tumor, presence of symptoms, and Dukes' C primary lesions; however, none was predictive. We were unable to develop a model to preoperatively predict the presence of intra-abdominal extrahepatic disease. The authors recommend a preoperative evaluation including physical examination, and computed tomographic scans of the abdomen and chest. A bone scan is required only in patients with symptoms referable to bone. Despite a negative preoperative evaluation, however, a considerable proportion of patients with colorectal hepatic metastases will have extrahepatic disease at the time of abdominal exploration.\r"

Proctometrograms were performed to measure rectal volumes at sensory threshold and maximal tolerance, and rectal compliance. Anal sphincter pressures and reflexes were measured by conventional techniques. Indices of colonic motility were also assessed. Significant impairment of rectal sensory threshold was apparent in constipation. Six patients presenting with impaction demonstrated functional megarectums. The remaining 19 showed a significant reduction in maximal rectal volume and rectal compliance and 14 extruded the balloon. There were no differences in sphincter length or presence of the rectosphincteric reflex. Four patients had an absent pudendoanal reflex and the remainder significant prolongation. Total gastrointestinal transit times were prolonged in the constipation group, mainly distally due to rectal stasis. In two patients bisacodyl failed to elicit a sigmoid motor response. Constipation in the elderly is not merely due to delayed transit. Neurogenic deficits of sacral spinal cord function may be responsible for abnormalities in rectal motor and sensory function.\r"

Of the 20 patients, 17 with normal preoperative manometric studies when compared with control subjects underwent a coloanal anastomosis as described by Castrini, and three patients with preoperative incontinence underwent abdominoperineal resection. Manometric studies preoperatively, and postoperatively at three and 12 months, indicated a statistically significant decrease in squeezing pressure, and rectal compliance at three months that almost normalized by 12 months. The rectal compliance correlated with the number of bowel movements per day at three months (four to five per day) and at 12 months (two to three per day). The rectoanal reflex and length of pressure zone have remained unchanged. Results seem to indicate that anal continence can be preserved after coloanal anastomosis.\r"

Variable amounts of neutral mucin and decreased sulfated acid mucin content, as well as increased CEA content, were found in the dysplastic epithelium of benign colonic adenomas.

Conventional techniques of intermittent intramuscular (IM) administration of analgesia have fallen short of meeting the needs of patients following major abdominal surgery. This has prompted a search for methods to improve postoperative pain management. Though PCA has been accepted in many hospitals, few studies comparing conventional IM administration of morphine with PCA have been performed. A prospective randomized study comparing IM- and PCA-administered morphine in 62 patients undergoing colon surgery was performed. A comparison of the efficacy of analgesia and extent of sedation using these approaches shows that PCA allows for analgesia with less sedation and less drug requirement than that of IM administration. No differences were noted in postoperative duration of ileus, duration of hospitalization, and total hospital costs. This study confirms the safety and efficacy of PCA, and should be considered the current optimal method of controlling pain following major colonic surgery.\r"

Ninety of these patients developed a fistula between the vagina and anus or rectum at an average age of 34 years. The track of the fistula was clearly documented in 80 patients and was extrasphincteric or suprasphincteric in 36, transsphincteric in 42 (high 13, low 29), and superficial in two. Of the 90 patients, 12 (13 percent) were managed throughout without recourse to surgery. Twelve (13 percent) had the fistula laid open or drainage of an abscess as the only surgery. Twelve (13 percent) underwent repair of the fistula and, of these, eight remain symptomatically cured. One has had further symptoms but no surgery while three later underwent proctectomy for rectal disease. In eight patients the colon was removed and the rectum defunctioned and in 34 the rectum was excised as the initial surgery after development of the fistula. The remaining 12 (13 percent) underwent later proctectomy for rectal disease or failed conservative management of the fistula. Extensive colonic involvement, rectal disease, or associated anal lesions were the main reasons for rectal excision in 38 patients. In only ten was the rectovaginal fistula a prominent indication for proctectomy. As medical treatment, repair, or other local surgery were successful in one third of the patients, these options should always be considered in the first instance.\r"

Half these patients exhibited delayed emptying of solids and accelerated emptying of liquids. Alterations in motility patterns were observed in the four patients tested including decreased frequency or absence of migrating motor complexes originating in the stomach, shortening or absence of phase I, and loss of distinct fasted and fed patterns. Both basal values and mean postprandial increments in serum gastrin concentrations were lower in the patients, whereas no significant difference was found for pancreatic polypeptide concentrations when compared to normals. Our findings emphasize the functional heterogeneity of patients with intestinal pseudoobstruction. In addition, in contrast to previous reports which used barium meals to access gastric function, we observed a high prevalence of gastric emptying disturbances in these patients, suggesting that the motility disturbance is not restricted to the small intestine.\r"

Recently, the sperm penetration assay (SPA) has been found to be an accurate method of quantitating male fertilization potential. We report the case of a man with ulcerative colitis in whom infertility and a markedly abnormal SPA were demonstrated while he was taking sulfasalazine. Shortly after discontinuing sulfasalazine and initiating treatment with 5-ASA enemas, his SPA became normal and his wife became pregnant. The SPA is a useful screening test for sulfasalazine-induced male infertility. On the other hand, 5-ASA enemas do not appear to be associated with an abnormal SPA.\r"

Studies were made by the endoscopic Congo red-methylene blue test developed in our hospital. In this test, acid-secreting areas and areas of intestinal metaplasia could be identified as discolored areas and areas staining blue with methylene blue, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the following variables were associated with a reduction in the size of the acid-secreting area in decreasing order of importance: the smoking index and age. The following factors had little or no influence on the size of the acid-secreting area: sex, and the consumption of aspirin and nonsteroidal, nonsalicylate, antiinflammatory drugs (NSNSAIDs). In general, in patients with a high smoking index, the acid-secreting area was small. Smoking had an influence in both younger and older patients and had more influence in females than in males. Multivariate analysis also shows that the following factors were associated with an increase in the area of intestinal metaplasia in decreasing order of importance: the extent of the acid-secreting area, age, and the smoking index. The following factors had little or no influence on the area of intestinal metaplasia: the consumption of aspirin and NSNSAIDs and sex. In general, in patients with little or no acid-secreting area, the area of intestinal metaplasia was extensive. These findings indicate that smoking is associated with reduction in the size of the acid-secreting area and so in development of intestinal metaplasia.\r"

The younger group displayed significantly stronger contractions of the external anal sphincter and puborectalis than the two patient groups, which did not differ. No differences were found in the relaxation of the internal and sphincter. The incontinent group required a significantly larger stimulus in order to detect rectal distension compared to either the continent patients or the younger normals. An additional group of unmatched normals and incontinent patients demonstrated significant differences in their ability to retain rectally infused saline. The patients leaked sooner and retained less; however, the performance of the normals was considerably reduced from that reported in previous studies. The aging process seems to result in weakening of the striated muscles of the anal canal, although fecal incontinence need not occur. The afferent limb of the anorectal sensorimotor mechanism does not necessarily deteriorate with aging. A lower threshold for sensation of rectal distension among continent individuals apparently helps them to avoid incontinent episodes, even though maximum contractile pressures in their anal canal are no different from a comparable group of incontinent individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Antroduodenal myoelectrical activity and duodenal digesta flow rate in young cattle were assessed by implanted nichrome wire electrodes and reentrant duodenal cannulation with interposed flow-meter. In addition, a small glass electrode was inserted through a duodenal cannula to continuously measure the pH of duodenal contents. When eating only hay ad libitum, the duodenal myoelectrical activity showed the usual migrating myoelectrical complex (MMC) pattern. Duodenal contents pH rose sharply at the end of a period of repetitive spike activity (RSA), or phase III, from pH less than 2 to greater than 5 and remained high through most of the subsequent period of no spike activity (NSA), or phase I, during which there was no antral spiking and no flow of duodenal contents. Feeding milk (pH 6.5) caused a marked increase in antroduodenal spike activity and intraduodenal flow rate, with a concomitant rapid rise in duodenal contents pH from 1.8 +/- 0.3 (SEM) to 5.0 +/- 0.2 which then slowly declined over the next few hours. Within 5 min after the administration of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist xylazine (25 and 50 micrograms/kg intramuscular), there was a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in antroduodenal spike frequency and a concomitant marked drop in intraduodenal flow rate with a sustained low pH of intraduodenal contents. The results suggest that: (1) continuous measurement of proximal duodenal pH adds a useful dimension to documenting relationships between antroduodenal myoelectrical activity and duodenal digesta flow rate; and (2) increased spike activity in the antroduodenal region does not necessarily indicate an increased duodenal flow rate is occurring.\r"

Total bile acids appearing in the portal blood of fistulated animals were measured when bile irrigated the whole bowel (control period) and again when it was diverted at 1 m proximal to the ileocecal valve so that enterohepatic circulation was limited to only the last meter of ileum plus large bowel. Measurements were taken just after the bile had been diverted and then four days later when a new steady state was reached. Under steady-state conditions bile acid reabsorption rate in distal bowel was 20% of the normal rate. This result has been discussed taking into account the high but transient ability of distal bowel to spare bile acids measured in the first hours after bile diversion. The present experiment, together with some other in vivo trials on small laboratory animals, indicate that the proximal bowel may take a large part in bile acid absorption and that we need to reevaluate the notion that bile acid absorption takes place mainly in distal bowel.\r"

Thirty rats received 0.0015% N-methyl-N-amylnitrosamine (MNAN) in the drinking water for 12 weeks. Another 30 rats received tap water. All rats then received tap water until sacrifice. Rats from each group were sacrificed immediately after MNAN administration, four weeks after, and eight weeks after. One hour before sacrifice, [3H]TdR was injected by tail vein to label proliferating cells. The entire esophagus and stomach were removed and processed for light and electron microscopy and autoradiography. The overall frequency of esophageal tumors after MNAN was 83% and did not differ significantly among the three experimental groups. Tumors were primarily papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas and occurred with equal frequency in the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the esophagus. No tumors were found in the squamous-lined forestomach. Electron microscopy revealed abundant tonofilaments, free ribosomes, and mitochondria accompanied by vacuoles. By autoradiography, esophageal epithelial proliferation was markedly stimulated in nontumorous mucosa from all three experimental groups. We conclude that MNAN ingestion for 12 weeks reliably produces papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas throughout the rat esophagus, but not in the squamous-lined forestomach, and that MNAN stimulated marked epithelial proliferation which is accompanied by thickening of the epithelium in nontumorous esophageal mucosa.\r"

Discrepancies between urinary and gastric PGA patterns were found in 63.3% of the individuals. In 9% of the subjects with these discrepancies, the phenotype class in urine was different from that in gastric mucosa. The differences were found in all diagnostic groups. The highest frequency of differences was found in patients with gastric ulcer. The differences were not related to the serum PGA level. More than 80% of the differences were caused by a lower relative intensity of pepsinogen A fraction 5 (Pg5) in urine than in gastric mucosa. The possible origin of differences in PGA isozymogen patterns was studied by organ culture of gastric biopsies. In vitro synthesis and secretion of pepsinogens were studied by electrophoresis and autoradiography. The synthesis rate of PGA in biopsies of 1-2 mm diameter was 40-100 ng/hr. Posttranslational modification of PGA isozymogens was demonstrated. Pg2 and part of Pg4 probably are secondary products of Pg3 and Pg5, respectively. In some individuals the secretion rate of Pg3 was low compared to the other isozymogens. The conversion of Pg3 into Pg2 and the differential secretion of the isozymogens may explain some of the discrepancies between gastric and urinary PGA patterns.\r"

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of a placebo capsule on meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin concentrations in 10 healthy subjects and also in 10 patients with chronic duodenal ulcer. Each subject and patient was studied twice and in random order, once with placebo therapy prior to the meal and once without placebo. In either healthy subjects or duodenal ulcer patients, meal-stimulated acid secretion and serum gastrin concentrations were not significantly different with or without placebo administration. These studies demonstrate that a placebo capsule, administered by a physician just prior to a meal, has little, if any, effect on acid secretion or gastrin release in response to the meal. Any beneficial effects of placebos in treating patients with peptic ulcer disease are probably unrelated to inhibition of meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion.\r"

In six patients sympathectomy was done by the supraclavicular approach, with removal of T2 and T3 ganglia. Manometry was performed before the operation and three weeks after it. In seven other patients sympathectomy was done by the axillary approach, with removal of T2-T4 ganglia. Manometry in this group was performed 28.4 +/- 22.4 months after the operation. Fifteen individuals with an intact sympathetic system served as controls. Manometric parameters evaluated were esophageal contraction amplitude and duration and lower esophageal sphincter pressure. The difference between the results obtained in the pre- and postoperative periods in the first group was not statistically significant. The differences between the two patient groups and between the patient groups and the control group were not statistically significant either. We conclude that upper dorsal sympathectomy does not affect esophageal motility in man.\r"

Manometric studies were performed in 18 patients with erosive esophagitis before and after healing of the mucosal lesions and in 15 healthy controls. Nine patients were treated with a Nissen fundoplication and nine with H2-receptor antagonists. After healing, patients were followed for a mean duration of 3.0 +/- 0.4 years. Compared to controls, patients had significantly lower contraction amplitudes and lower esophageal sphincter pressures (P less than 0.01), while the duration and velocity of esophageal contractions was similar in both groups. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure increased after surgical treatment, while no such changes were observed in medically treated patients. In both groups amplitude, duration, and velocity of esophageal contractions were not affected by healing of esophagitis. On extended follow-up, all surgically treated patients remained asymptomatic while eight of nine medically treated patients developed a symptomatic relapse which was accompanied by erosive esophagitis in six of them. The lack of improvement in esophageal motor function after healing of esophagitis may contribute to the frequent occurrence of relapse in medically treated patients.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if improvement in symptoms and endoscopic appearance after treatment was associated with a reduction in reflux, as measured with 24-hr pH recordings. Twenty patients with severe chronic reflux esophagitis participated in an eight-week double-blind trial of medical therapy with metoclopramide and cimetidine versus placebo and cimetidine. Significant symptom score improvement was noted in 11 patients. Eleven patients also had improvement in the endoscopic appearance of the esophageal mucosa, and eight of these patients had significant symptom improvement. Initial 24-hr pH recordings were abnormal in all patients, evidenced by an esophageal pH less than 4 during 20% of the study period. Improvement in 24-hr results was noted in only five patients--three with clinical and endoscopic improvement, and two with no improvement. In conclusion, there was no relationship between clinical improvement and the results of 24-hr pH recordings. Successful symptom relief and endoscopic healing of esophagitis during medical treatment may occur despite persistent reflux of gastric contents.\r"

Whether this increased secretion first occurs at an early or late stage of alcoholic pancreatic disease is unknown. In this study we measured lactoferrin and enzyme outputs in duodenal juice from 10 healthy subjects and three groups of alcoholic subjects: asymptomatic chronic alcoholics without evidence, clinically or biochemically, of pancreatitis (10), those recovered from acute pancreatitis (8), and those with established chronic pancreatitis (8). A multilumen, marker-perfused duodenal catheter was used to aspirate basal pancreatic secretions at the ligament of Treitz. The mean ( +/-SE) lactoferrin concentration in duodenal juice for the four groups of subjects was: healthy, 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml; asymptomatic alcoholics, 5.5 +/- 1.5 micrograms/ml; alcoholics who had recovered from acute pancreatitis, 7.4 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml; and alcoholics with chronic pancreatitis 7.1 +/- 1.9 micrograms/ml. The three groups of alcoholics each had a greater lactoferrin concentration than the normals (P less than 0.005). The output of lactoferrin in the four groups paralleled the concentration in that the three groups of alcoholics had a significantly greater output: healthy subjects, 3.4 +/- 0.5 micrograms/kg/hr; asymptomatic alcoholics, 25.7 +/- 7.4 micrograms/kg/hr; alcoholics recovered from acute pancreatitis, 80.1 +/- 27 micrograms/kg/hr; and alcoholics with chronic pancreatitis, 90.9 +/- 32 micrograms/kg/hr. The output of chymotrypsin and trypsin in the four groups of subjects revealed increased secretory rates in the asymptomatic alcoholics and the alcoholics recovered from acute pancreatitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Foam was present in 32% of colons prepared with Golytely alone but in none of the colons prepared with Golytely supplemented with simethicone. In addition, only 5% of colons prepared with supplemental simethicone had residual stool noted at the time of colonoscopy, a significant improvement over the 39% prevalence of residual stool in colons prepared with Golytely alone. Addition of simethicone to Golytely lavage decreases the prevalence of colonic foam and residual stool.\r"

The correlation was significant (P less than 0.05) for the malignant and benign intrahepatic obstructions but not for the benign extrahepatic obstructions. This is consistent with the idea that circulating high levels of bile acids in patients with long-standing biliary obstruction may cause damage to Kupffer cell membranes and to their receptors for beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase, impeding the clearance of the enzyme from the circulation resulting in elevated serum levels.\r"

Subcutaneously administered indomethacin (25 mg/kg) produced gastric mucosal lesions within 4 hr. In parallel studies, an equivalent dose of indomethacin inhibited gastric HCO3- secretion, and stimulated gastric motor activity measured as intraluminal pressure recordings, whereas acid secretion was unaffected. The lesions induced by indomethacin were significantly prevented by three agents: cimetidine (100 mg/kg), which reduced acid secretion; atropine (1 mg/kg), which reduced acid secretion and gastric motility; and 16,16-dmPGE2 (10 micrograms/kg), which reduced acid secretion and motility and increased gastric HCO3- secretion. If acid (150 mM HCl) was infused into the stomach (1.2 ml/hr) during indomethacin treatment, only the latter two agents significantly prevented the formation of gastric lesions in response to indomethacin. Since only the effect on gastric motility was common to these two agents (atropine and 16,16-dmPGE2), the increased gastric motility may be an important pathogenetic factor in indomethacin-induced gastric lesions. The presence of acid as well as a deficiency of endogenous PGs may be prerequisite for later extension of the lesions but cannot account for the induction of mucosal lesions in rats following administration of indomethacin.\r"

Esophagitis was induced in adult cats using a constant infusion of 0.1 N HCl at 1 ml/min for 20 min. Animals were infused for either one or three days. Mucosal lesions were evaluated by blinded investigators using both fiberoptic endoscopy and light microscopy. Histologic changes included basal cell hyperplasia, intraepithelial leukocytosis, and subepithelial leukocytosis. Liquid sucralfate given prior to acid infusion consistently prevented acid-induced lesions in both one- and three-day infusions, demonstrated by both endoscopy and quantitative histologic scoring. Indomethacin (200 micrograms/kg) given prior to sucralfate and acid did not affect sucralfate cytoprotection. Synthetic PGE1, given in doses of 5 micrograms/kg and 100 micrograms/kg, afforded no esophageal cytoprotection. These studies indicate that sucralfate is cytoprotective against acid-induced esophageal injury in cats, an effect that does not appear to be mediated by prostaglandin. In addition, synthetic PGE1 does not confer protection in this animal model.\r"

The effect of pretreatment with the corticoid dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) on such gastrointestinal damage in the rat has now been investigated, using macroscopic observation and the release of acid phosphatase, as an enzyme marker of cell disruption. Administration of PAF-acether (100 ng/kg/min intravenously, for 10 min) induced focal, intense hyperemia and hemorrhage in all the regions of the gastrointestinal tract, with the exception of the distal colon. This damage was associated with an increase in the release of acid phosphatase into the lumen of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum following incubation in vitro. Pretreatment with dexamethasone reduced the macroscopically apparent gastrointestinal damage following PAF-acether administration and abolished the intraluminal release of acid phosphatase. Dexamethasone also significantly suppressed the hemoconcentration, as determined by changes in platelet and erythrocyte count and hematocrit, 30 min after PAF-acether infusion. Thus, as in endotoxin shock, this glucocorticoid can reduce the gastrointestinal damage associated with PAF-acether administration.\r"

Pain remitted completely in 16 patients within 12 mo, but continued in the other 13 patients. At presentation, no differences were found in the type or prevalence of symptoms or neurophysiological measurements (electrophysiology and cardiovascular autonomic function tests) between the patients whose pain remitted and those whose pain continued. Most electrophysiological measurements improved slightly in remitting patients but deteriorated slightly in those whose pain continued to reveal a significant difference (P less than .05) between the groups on final review. Similarly, abnormal autonomic nerve function improved slightly when pain remitted but worsened or persisted in patients whose pain continued, again revealing a significant difference between the groups (P less than .05) on final review. We also observed that pain remission usually occurred if the onset of symptoms shortly followed some sudden metabolic change (e.g., rapid improvement in glycemic control, ketoacidosis, anorexia nervosa) when the duration of diabetes was relatively short or when considerable weight loss preceded the onset of pain. We suggest that remitting and chronic painful diabetic polyneuropathy have distinctive clinical features at presentation and detectable neurophysiological differences during their symptomatic evolution.\r"

Fifty-one NIDDM patients were randomly assigned to either intervention or control groups. The intervention group participated in courses of three weekly lessons presented by a physician, nurse, and dietitian once every 4 mo. The intervention and control groups were also followed once every 2 mo in the clinic by the same staff. Medical treatment remained unchanged during the study. After a 12-mo follow-up of the intervention group, no significant improvement in their knowledge of diabetes could be demonstrated. However, mean fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels and HbA1c improved significantly in comparison with the control group. The same tendency was evident with the weight and lipoprotein profile. We conclude that educational group therapy can improve diabetes control in patients with NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of lower-extremity amputations was estimated in the Pima Indians of the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, a population with a high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Between 1972 and 1984, from a study population of 4399 subjects, lower-extremity amputations were performed on 84 patients, 80 (95%) of whom had NIDDM. Among diabetic subjects, the incidence rate of first lower-extremity amputations was higher in men than in women. Rates increased significantly with increasing duration of diabetes. Presence of medial arterial calcification, retinopathy, or nephropathy; absence of patellar tendon reflexes; impaired great toe vibration-perception threshold; and degree of fasting and 2-h postload hyperglycemia were significant risk factors for amputations. Serum cholesterol concentration, blood pressure, age, and absence of Achilles tendon reflexes were not predictive of amputations. The death rate was greater in diabetic amputees than in diabetic nonamputees of similar age, sex, and duration of diabetes, and a significant increase in cardiovascular deaths was observed in diabetic subjects with amputations. The incidence rate of lower-extremity amputations in diabetic Pima Indians is higher than that reported in other diabetic populations. This may reflect differences in risk or a more complete case ascertainment than was possible in previous studies. If the latter is true, the rate of amputations in diabetic individuals may be higher than has been previously appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "Specific receptors for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on cultured human choriocarcinoma cells (JEG-3 and BeWo) were characterized. The binding of 125I-labeled recombinant (Thr59)IGF-I to the cells was reversible and time, temperature, and pH dependent. Steady state of binding occurred after 16 h at 4 C, pH 7.4. Natural human IGF-I (hIGF-I), hIGF-II, recombinant (N-Met)IGF-I, rat multiplication-stimulating activity, and insulin were 200%, 37%, 37%, 1.6%, and 0.1% as potent as (Thr59)IGF-I in inhibiting the binding of [125I]iodo-(Thr59)IGF-I to JEG-3 cells, respectively. Epidermal growth factor was ineffective. The half-maximal displacement of [125I]iodo-(Thr59)IGF-I by unlabeled (Thr59)IGF-I occurred at 11 +/- 2 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) in both JEG-3 and BeWo cells. Scatchard analysis of the competitive binding data revealed linear plots indicating a single species of binding sites with an association constant of 0.8 X 10(9) M-1 for the binding of [125I]iodo-(Thr59)IGF-I to both cell lines. The binding capacity was 30,000 and 20,000 sites/cell for JEG-3 and BeWo cells, respectively. Chemical cross-linking of [125I]iodo-(Thr59)IGF-I to JEG-3 cells revealed two receptor complexes of 130K and 260K. Their formation was completely inhibited by an excess of unlabeled (Thr59)IGF-I or hIGF-II. Increasing amounts of insulin affected both labeled bands equally, suggesting that the 130K and 260K bands represent the monomer and dimer forms, respectively, of the ligand-binding alpha-subunit of type I IGF receptor. (Thr59)IGF-I, in a dose-dependent manner, stimulated uptake of nonmetabolizable alpha-[3H]aminoisobutyric acid by JEG-3 cells, showing that the receptor is biologically active. Our results demonstrate that choriocarcinoma cells possess functional high affinity type I IGF receptors and suggest that IGF-I is involved in the growth-regulating processes of JEG-3 and BeWo cells. These cells may provide a useful model to study the role of IGFs in trophoblast physiology.\r"

  ".W": "Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) levels were measured in serum samples collected sequentially from rats into which indwelling catheters had been inserted. A distinct diurnal variation in CBG levels was found, with the highest levels of binding protein at the beginning of the dark period. CBG levels then decreased until a nadir was reached shortly after the beginning of the light period. To examine the role of glucocorticoid in the generation of this pattern, rats were adrenalectomized 10 days before repeating the experiment. Adrenalectomy abolished both the diurnal variation in CBG levels and the high degree of variation in the levels of binding protein between animals. However, adrenalectomy just before the onset of the dark period did not eliminate the expected decrease in CBG levels. To further explore the role of steroid, animals that had been adrenalectomized for 10 days were given saline containing 25 micrograms/ml corticosterone for a period of 24 h. Despite the attainment of normal plasma corticosterone levels, no decrease in CBG levels was observed. When steroid administration was discontinued, however, CBG levels dropped concurrently with the decreasing steroid. These studies show that a diurnal variation in CBG exists and suggest that it is the result of the diurnal variation in glucocorticoid levels.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently described structural differences between insulin receptors isolated from rat skeletal muscle and liver. In this report we compared their intrinsic kinase activity and their precipitability with antiphosphotyrosine and polyclonal anti-beta-subunit antibodies before and after stimulation by insulin in vitro or in vivo. Liver derived receptors incubated with insulin showed 40-50% less autophosphorylation and exogenous substrate tyrosine kinase activity per insulin binding site than those from muscle, as well as a 50% reduction in the proportion of antiphosphotyrosine precipitable receptors. After tyrosine kinase was maximally activated by iv insulin injection (in vivo), antiphosphotyrosine antibodies precipitated 60% and 38% of insulin receptors from muscle and liver, respectively. Addition of insulin in vitro to in vivo activated receptors increased the proportion of antiphosphotyrosine antibody-precipitable receptors in both tissues but increased the tyrosine kinase activity only in liver-derived receptors, indicating that most activatable insulin receptors reside on the plasmalemma in muscle whereas a significant proportion (35%) of liver receptors are not accessible to insulin in vivo. No tissue specific differences were apparent in the interaction of three site specific anti-beta-subunit antibodies with the receptors. Conclusions: 1) The intrinsic kinase activity per insulin binding site is less in liver than in muscle. This reflects in part the greater proportion of insulin receptors from liver which do not autophosphorylate on tyrosine upon insulin binding. 2) Some insulin receptors can be phosphorylated on tyrosine in vitro without concomitant exogenous tyrosine kinase activation.\r"

  ".W": "The concentrations of T4 and T3 were measured in brain, liver, and lung of fetal lambs at 100 days gestational age. The highest concentrations of T4 were found in lung (26.8 ng/g). Brain T4 (8.8 ng/g) was only 30% of lung T4. In contrast, higher concentrations of T3 were found in brain (1.8 ng/g) than in lung (0.39 ng/g) or liver (0.36 ng/g). Nuclear T3 was 16% of the total T3 in brain and 44% of that in lung. The degree of saturation of the nuclear T3 receptor was estimated from the concentrations of nuclear T3 and nuclear receptor. Receptor saturation was low in liver and lung (10%) and high in brain (74%). Receptor occupancy was also measured directly in vitro by comparing the binding of [125I]T3 in nuclear extracts at 0 and 20 C. This method is based on the different rates of dissociation of the T3-receptor complex at these temperatures (0.045 and 0.618 h-1, respectively). Therefore, [125I]T3 was bound mainly to unoccupied sites at 0 C, whereas at 20 C it bound to unoccupied sites plus a fraction (70%) of endogenously occupied sites. There was no difference in binding at the two temperatures using lung extract, reflecting a very low occupancy. Data from brain suggested 61% receptor saturation. Total and free T3 were measured in plasma and in lung and brain cytosols, and the figures were compared to the intranuclear free T3 calculated by the law of mass action, from the affinity and saturation of receptor. In lung, the concentrations of cytosolic (5.4 +/- 1.9 pM) and nuclear (8.6 pM) free T3 were similar to that of plasma T3 (3.7 +/- 0.99 pM). In contrast, brain cytosolic (14.9 +/- 1.2 pM) and nuclear (203 pM) free T3 revealed the presence of free T3 gradients from cytosol to plasma (4-fold) and from nucleus to cytosol (13.6-fold). The data suggest that the sheep brain is a major target of thyroid hormone action at the end of the neuroblast proliferation period. Mechanisms are locally present in the brain at this stage of development to ensure a high saturation of the nuclear T3 receptor.\r"

Based on its binding characteristics the receptor appears to be the type II glucocorticoid receptor. With the use of a monoclonal antibody against purified liver glucocorticoid receptor, immunostaining was found in magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the SON, but not in magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Immunoreactive cells seem to be concentrated in ventral parts of the SON where vasopressin cells were previously shown to be located. One to 2 weeks after bilateral adrenalectomy, there was a substantial decrease in glucocorticoid receptor immunostaining in magnocellular as well as other types of neurons in various brain regions. Administration of synthetic glucocorticoids (RU 28362 or dexamethasone) induced a robust increase in the intensity of immunostaining in cell nuclei of neurosecretory cells. The presence of glucocorticoid receptors in the SON suggests that glucocorticoids may affect vasopressin synthesis or/and secretion through a direct action on magnocellular neurons.\r"

Three groups were subsequently treated daily with 1.8 micrograms L-T4/100 g body wt: 1) for the first 12 days [T + T4 (I)]; 2) from the 12th day until death [T + T4 (II)]; or 3) for the entire 21-day study [T + T4 (I + II)]. The other T animals were maintained without treatment. (T), and another group of mated rats were sham operated (C). Maternal body weight increase during gestation did not differ between T + T4 (I + II) and C dams, whereas it was smaller in T dams from the 7th gestational day onward. Neither interruption of T4 treatment in the T + T4 (I) rats after the 12th day nor treatment initiated at that time in the T + T4 (II) group modified their body weights. At day 21, the weights of the maternal conceptus-free body and liver, the placenta, and the fetuses were lower in the T and T + T4 (II) animals than in either the C and the T + T4 (I + II) animals. Maternal plasma T4 and pituitary GH content were reduced, and plasma TSH was enhanced in both T and T + T4 (I) dams. In fetuses, plasma TSH concentration was augmented in T and T + T4 (I) rats and unchanged in T + T4 (II) animals when compared with those of T + T4 (I + II). Pituitary GH content was reduced in T and T + T4 (II) fetuses and unchanged in the T + T4 (I) group. We propose that maternal thyroidectomy greatly decreases the thyroid hormone levels in embryonic structures during the first half of gestation and inhibits normal maternal metabolic changes during this period. In addition to interfering with normal fetal development, these effects reduce the quantity of maternal substrates available to fetuses during the last phase of gestation. In contrast, when maternal hypothyroidism occurs during the second half of gestation, the effects are not as detrimental because fetal thyroid gland activity is adequate, and maternal catabolic adaptations are not impaired.\r"

P receptors (PgR) in adult mammary glands are under estrogenic regulation. By contrast in immature, pubertal 5-week-old mice, PgR are present only in low concentration and cannot be increased by estrogen (E). Having identified two different mammary gland developmental states with differing PgR compositions, the purpose of the present studies was to investigate the roles of E-dependent and -independent PgR in epithelial cell proliferation. DNA histoautoradiography was used to quantitate the effect of P on DNA synthesis; hormonal effects on mammary gland morphology were also assessed. The results demonstrate the P, rather than E, has a major role in stimulating epithelial DNA synthesis in the adult mammary gland. The morphological correlate of P's stimulatory effect on cell proliferation was increased ductal side-branching. We postulate that P is acting via E-dependent PgR and that one important way in which E promotes epithelial cell proliferation in adult tissue is by its ability to increase PgR concentration. In the immature mammary gland E rather than P is primarily responsible for stimulation of epithelial cell proliferation at this developmental stage. It appears likely that the absence of a predominant, P-mediated cell proliferative effect is related to the lack of E-dependent PgR.\r"

For 12 weeks six groups of female albino rats aged 4 months which had their skeletons labeled with 45Ca were fed matched amounts of low-calcium (0.1% Ca) hydroxyproline-free diet. The six treatment groups were: group 1, Sham-OVX; group 2, Sham-OVX + prednisolone; group 3, OVX; group 4, OVX + prednisolone; group 5, OVX + E2; group 6, OVX + E2 + prednisolone. Bone resorption was estimated by studying the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and 45Ca. Parathyroid function was assessed indirectly from urinary cAMP excretion. Treatments did not influence parathyroid activity or serum levels of calcium or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. However, ovariectomy increased bone resorption and induced osteopenia whereas prednisolone decreased bone resorption and formation and caused osteopenia. Ovariectomy increased the rate of bone resorption in prednisolone-treated rats; prednisolone lowered the rates of bone resorption and formation in OVX rats. The osteopenic effects of prednisolone and ovariectomy were additive and independent. E2 protected bone from the osteopenic effects of ovariectomy but did not affect bone loss induced by prednisolone. These results suggest prophylactic estrogen should help to avoid bone loss from estrogen deficiency in patients requiring chronic high dose glucocorticoid treatment.\r"

Studies were conducted in cell lines derived from a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and a human lung cancer (M103). Treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the secretion of both CT and CgA by the two cell lines. Phorbol at 1000 nM resulted in 4- and 10-fold increases in CgA secretion and 3- and 5-fold increases in CT secretion by the MTC and M103 cells, respectively. The secretory patterns were similar for CgA and CT. In the M103 cells the same treatment resulted in a 100% increase in CgA-specific cytoplasmic RNA and a 70% increase in CT-specific cytoplasmic RNA. The secretion of CgA and CT was coordinately regulated by phorbol in both MTC and M103 cells, and related mRNA changes could be detected in the M103 cells. These observations support the hypothesis that CT and CgA secretion and gene expression are under similar regulatory controls.\r"

T levels had returned to 0 h levels by 12 h in naturally delivered males. T was significantly lower in females than in males 0, 2, and 24 h after natural delivery, whereas T levels were equivalent in males and females immediately after cesarean delivery. Male kits kept on a heating pad for 2 h after natural delivery had lower plasma T levels than males that were left with their mothers over this same period. Brain aromatase activity in anterior hypothalamus-preoptic area, medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), temporal lobe, and cerebral cortex was equivalent in males and females at all postpartum ages, regardless of whether delivery occurred by cesarean section or naturally. However, in naturally delivered kits of both sexes significant elevations in aromatase activity occurred in MBH and temporal lobe 24 h postpartum. Finally, E2 concentrations in anterior hypothalamus-preoptic area and MBH were equivalent 0 and 2 h postpartum in males and females, regardless of whether they were delivered naturally or by cesarean section. The observed postnatal elevation in T may contribute to brain and behavioral sexual differentiation of male ferrets. It is unclear, however, whether such an effect of T depends on its neural aromatization to E2.\r"

  ".W": "A short term incubation of baboon fetal adrenal cells obtained at midgestation and near term was used to determine whether a change in the regulation of androgen formation occurs with advancing gestation. Adrenal glands were removed from baboon (Papio anubis) fetuses on day 100 (mid; n = 7) or day 170 (late; n = 5) of gestation, and cells were dispersed with 0.2% collagenase. Cells (10(5] were incubated at 37 C for 3 h in medium 199 in the presence or absence of 10 nM ACTH, 10 nM ovine PRL, 10 nM ovine GH, 50 nM hCG, or 50 nM human chorionic somatomammotropin. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA), DHA sulfate (DHAS), cortisol (F), and androstenedione concentrations were determined in the medium by RIA. At midgestation, ACTH, PRL, and GH elevated (P less than 0.05) DHA (168%, 169%, and 178%, respectively) and DHAS (142%, 210%, and 197%, respectively) formation. Near term, ACTH and PRL retained their ability to stimulate (P less than 0.05) DHA (307% and 220%, respectively), but not DHAS, synthesis. The fetal adrenal at late gestation, however, lost its ability to respond to treatment with GH. hCG and human chorionic somatomammotropin did not stimulate steroidogenesis at either time of gestation. F formation at midgestation was less (P less than 0.05) than that at term and not responsive to ACTH. ACTH stimulated (P less than 0.05) F secretion by 68% in fetal adrenal cells obtained near term. The secretion of androstenedione was not affected by any peptide treatment at either stage of gestation. These data indicate that the responsivity of the baboon fetal adrenal to various pituitary peptides is different at two developmentally distinct stages of gestation. We conclude, therefore, that the regulation of fetal adrenal steroidogenesis changes with advancing gestation.\r"

These biochemical steps involve 1) rapid loss of nuclear androgen receptor retention; by 12 h after castration, androgen receptors are no longer detectable in ventral prostatic nuclei; 2) an initial fragmentation of nuclear DNA into low mol wt (less than 1000 basepairs) nucleosomal oligomers which lack intranucleosomal break points; and 3) eventual complete digestion of these nucleosomal oligomers into component nucleotides. Additional studies demonstrate that activation of a Ca2+-Mg2+-dependent endonuclease is associated with this DNA fragmentation. By 4 days after castration, maximal DNA fragmentation is obtained, with 15% of the total nuclear DNA extractable as low mol wt fragments. Proteolytic enzymes are apparently not involved initially in this process, suggesting that DNA fragmentation is a discrete event in, rather than a result of, cell death. Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content demonstrated that each day after castration, a subpopulation of androgen-dependent cells in rat ventral prostate fragmented all of their genomic DNA, as opposed to the whole population of cells fragmenting an increasing portion of their DNA daily.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of viruses as the cause of some thyroid disorders was evaluated in three strains of mice neonatally infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. We report the first definitive evidence that viruses can persist in the thyroid gland, particularly thyroid epithelial cells in which thyroglobulin is synthesized. Concomitant with the infection of these cells was a significant reduction in the level of thyroglobulin mRNA and circulating thyroid hormones. Another virus that causes persistent infection but does not replicate in the thyroid gland failed to alter serum levels of thyroid hormones, indicating the thyroid dysfunction was not a generalized result of stress accompanying a persistent infection. This alteration in thyroid homeostasis during persistent infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is not caused by autoantibodies to the thyroid. Moreover, despite infection of the thyroid gland, neither necrosis nor inflammation occurs. Thyroid dysfunction was noted both when persistence was initiated at birth and in utero during congenital infection. These observations in an experimental model raise the issue that viruses may play a role in the pathogenesis of some thyroid disorders in man.\r"

  ".W": "Physiological evidence suggests that hypothalamic somatostatin (SS) inhibits pituitary GH release and that GH acts through a short-loop feedback mechanism to stimulate SS secretion. The feedback action of GH could be mediated by an effect on SS synthesis, secretion, or both. We hypothesized that GH acts to regulate the expression of the SS gene and that changes in the level of circulating GH would result in corresponding changes in SS mRNA in cells of the periventricular nucleus (PeN) of the hypothalamus. To test this hypothesis we measured the effect of hypophysectomy (HPX) and HPX with bovine GH (bGH) replacement on SS mRNA signal levels in cells of the PeN of the rat brain. We report that HPX male rats treated with bGH have significantly higher PeN SS mRNA signal than their vehicle-treated controls (P less than 0.05) and that bGH administration to sham-HPX rats results in elevated PeN SS mRNA signal levels compared to those in sham-HPX rats treated with vehicle (P less than 0.05). These observations suggest that GH participates in the regulation of its own secretion by influencing the expression of the SS gene and that one mechanism of short-loop pituitary feedback may involve the modulation of neuropeptide gene expression.\r"

We also studied urinary metabolites of [35S] MMI and [35S]PTU in one human subject. In bile collected from [35S]MMI-injected rats, two major metabolites accounted for 80-90% of the total 35S. Incubation of these metabolites either with or without beta-glucuronidase led to the appearance of a 35S-labeled compound less polar than MMI. In contrast, the major [35S]PTU metabolite in bile (greater than 50% of total 35S) was completely converted to [35S]PTU on incubation with beta-glucuronidase and showed no conversion in a control incubation. From these results we conclude that the major biliary metabolites of MMI in rats are not glucuronides. They appear to be labile conjugates of a metabolite of MMI. After [35S]MMI injection into rats, two major and at least four minor metabolites were observed in urine. In one human who received [35S]MMI orally, the HPLC profile of 35S in urine was similar to that of the rat. Incubation of human urine or of its isolated major component with beta-glucuronidase had no significant effect on the HPLC profile. On the other hand, the major urinary metabolite of [35S]PTU in human and rat urine was completely converted to [35S]PTU on incubation of whole urine with beta-glucuronidase. These results indicate that glucuronides comprise at most only a minor fraction of MMI metabolites in urine of rats or humans. Based on similarities in elution time, the metabolites of [35S]PTU in urine closely resembled those in bile of rats. In contrast, the metabolites of [35S]MMI in urine were strikingly different from those in bile. PTU displays noncovalent binding to serum protein to a much greater extent than does MMI. However, after injection of [35S]MMI into rats, a significant fraction of the 35S was firmly bound to protein in both serum and liver. This binding appeared to be covalent and involved metabolism of [35S]MMI. This type of binding was much less detectable after the injection of [35S]PTU into rats.\r"

The biochemical and bone histomorphometric findings in canine lymphosarcoma were examined in 19 hypercalcemic and 17 nonhypercalcemic dogs with lymphosarcoma. Compared to the nonhypercalcemic group, the hypercalcemic dogs demonstrated an increase in fasting and 24-h calcium excretion, an increase in fractional phosphorus excretion, and a significant increase in nephrogenous AMP excretion. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and immunoreactive PTH levels were equivalent in the two groups. Quantitative bone histomorphometry performed on iliac crest biopsies revealed increased parameters of bone resorption in those hypercalcemic dogs with no evidence of tumor at the biopsy site, without a compensatory increase in bone formation. Acid-urea tumor tissue extracts from eight hypercalcemic and six nonhypercalcemic dogs were examined for adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity (ACSA). All tumors from hypercalcemic dogs contained ACSA, whereas none of the tumors from nonhypercalcemic dogs had ACSA. Further purification of one tumor extract yielded an adenylate cyclase-stimulating protein which appeared to interact specifically with the PTH receptor. We conclude that in some cases, hypercalcemia in canine lymphosarcoma is mediated by a tumor-derived circulating bone-resorbing factor which is distinct from PTH. ACSA detected in tumor tissue appears to be a reliable marker for the syndrome in vivo. The role of this activity in the pathogenesis of the syndrome remains to be determined.\r"

Differential screening of the hybrid phages was performed using control and stimulated cDNAs as probes. Selected clones were then characterized by Northern and Southern blot hybridizations. In all, eight unique clones corresponding to estrogen-stimulated messages in rat uterus were identified. These clones hybridized to uterine mRNAs varying in size from 1.4-8.4 kilobases. Three of the clones were characterized as coding for three different types of collagen, and one as coding for smooth muscle actin. These are described in more detail elsewhere. The kinetics of increase in estrogen-regulated messages was examined. After a single injection of estradiol, five clones, including the three collagen mRNAs, showed two peaks of accumulation, at 4 and 24 h. Messages of two other clones were maximal at 12 h. The actin clone hybridized to mRNAs with peaks at 4 h for cytoskeletal actins and 8-12 h for smooth muscle actins. Sequential 24-h injections of the hormone produced multiple peaks of mRNA accumulation with a timing consistent with the kinetics found after a single injection of hormone. The multiple injections, however, did not result in enhanced mRNA accumulation for any of these clones. In fact, several messages showed suppressed accumulation with continued estradiol administration. Accumulated inhibitory factors in uterine cells may be responsible for this refractory condition. Except for the actin mRNA, the estradiol-stimulated mRNAs were expressed mainly in uterus and ovary. These clones may be useful in studies on the mechanism of action of estrogenic hormones and their tissue-specific regulation of gene expression.\r"

On day 100 of gestation (term = day 184), fetuses were exteriorized, and a constant infusion of saline (0.1 ml/min) was initiated via a fetal femoral vein. Forty minutes later, a bolus injection of 30 nmol ACTH/ml saline (n = 5), 40 nmol ovine PRL/ml saline (n = 4), or 1 ml saline (n = 5) was administered via the fetal femoral venous catheter. ACTH (0.15 nmol/min.0.1 ml saline), PRL (0.20 nmol/min.0.1 ml saline), or saline (0.1 ml/min) was then infused for an additional 25 min. Blood samples were obtained from the contralateral fetal femoral vein and the maternal saphenous vein immediately before and after peptide infusion and from the umbilical vein and artery at the end of the infusion. Fetal serum DHA concentrations (range, 9-11 micrograms/100 ml) were significantly increased (P less than 0.05) by PRL and ACTH, but not by saline. In contrast, fetal concentrations of cortisol (15-20 micrograms/100 ml) and DHA sulfate (DHAS; 13-18 micrograms/100 ml) were not altered by infusion of test substances into the fetus. The maternal concentrations of F (49-61 micrograms/100 ml) and DHAS (19-22 micrograms/100 ml) exceeded (P less than 0.05) respective values in the fetus, whereas DHA concentrations (2-3 micrograms/100 ml) in the mother were lower (P less than 0.05) than those in fetal serum. The serum concentrations of DHA, DHAS, and cortisol in the mother were not altered by PRL or ACTH. Regardless of the treatment, concentrations of DHA and DHAS in umbilical vein were lower (P less than 0.05) than those in the umbilical artery. These findings indicate that PRL as well as ACTH are effective in vivo in stimulating serum DHA concentrations in fetal baboons at midgestation. The greater concentration of DHA in umbilical artery vs. umbilical vein as well as the lack of response in maternal DHA concentrations indicate that the site of action of PRL and ACTH is the fetal adrenal. Therefore, we conclude that at midgestation, there is the potential for multifactorial regulation of baboon fetal adrenal androgen production and that PRL, in addition to ACTH, can function as a fetal adrenocorticotropic factor in vivo.\r"

White Leghorn cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed isocaloric semipurified diets containing either 8% [low (L)] or 20% [normal (N)] soy protein for 4 weeks ad libitum. Cockerels were quickly killed by decapitation and exsanguination. Trunk plasma corticosterone (B) and ACTH levels were measured by RIA. Maximal B-binding capacity (CBC) of plasma was also measured. In addition, in randomly selected cockerels, a rough index of the B clearance rate was determined. Finally, to determine the influence of protein malnutrition on adrenocortical cell function per se, we measured the acute (2-h) B responses of highly enriched adrenocortical cell populations to various ACTH analogs, 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), and cellular B production maximally supported with 25-hydroxycholesterol. Plasma B and ACTH concentrations of L cockerels were, respectively, 160% greater and 32% less than those of N cockerels. In addition, plasma B clearance rate of L birds was 85% greater than that of N birds, thus suggesting a greater B secretion rate in L birds. However, maximal plasma CBC of L cockerels was 59% less than that of N cockerels. Thus, the free plasma B concentration of L birds was greater than that of N birds. The increase in the plasma B concentration of L cockerels is explained in part by the relative adrenal weight of these birds which was 88% greater than that of N cockerels. In addition, there were differences at the adrenocortical cell level. On an equal cell concentration basis, basal and maximal B production values (stimulated by ACTH analogs and 8-Br-cAMP, and supported by 25-hydroxycholesterol) of L cockerel adrenocortical cells were, respectively, 73% and 139% greater than those of N cockerel adrenocortical cells. In addition, maximal ACTH-induced aldosterone production of L bird cells was 104% greater than that of N bird cells, such that the ratio of aldosterone production to B production was not altered by protein deprivation. The data suggest that the greater steroidogenic capacity of L cockerel cells was due to an increase in intracellular steroidogenic enzyme content and/or activity and not to an alteration in the composition of adrenocortical cell types within the populations of isolated cells. Furthermore, ACTH analog ED50 values for B, aldosterone, and cAMP production by L bird cells were about one third to one fifth the values for N bird cells, thus indicating that L bird cells were about 3-5 times more sensitive to ACTH than were N bird cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To investigate this possibility, we measured some ACTH receptor parameters in isolated adrenocortical cells from normal and dietary protein-restricted domestic fowl. White Leghorn cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed isocaloric semipurified diets containing either 8% [low (L)] or 20% [normal (N)] soy protein for 4 weeks ad libitum. Cockerels were quickly killed by decapitation and exsanguination, and adrenal glands were removed and prepared for cell isolation. Highly enriched (greater than 80% pure) adrenocortical cells (collagenase isolated, followed by separation on a Percoll continuous density gradient) were evaluated for ACTH receptors using pharmacological and radioligand approaches. In a pharmacological approach, we measured the influence of the complete, competitive antagonist, human (h) ACTH-(7-38) on hACTH-(7-39)-induced corticosterone production by adrenocortical cells from L and N cockerels. Inhibitor constants of hACTH-(7-38), calculated from Schild plots, were 3.16 X 10(-7) and 9.82 X 10(-7) M for L and N cockerel cells, respectively, thus suggesting differences in ACTH receptor function between the two treatment groups. To characterize ACTH receptors directly, we measured the binding of a monoiodinated ACTH analog [125I-Tyr23]hACTH-(1-39) to domestic fowl adrenocortical cells. Binding was linear with cell concentration, highly specific (only ACTH peptides caused significant displacement), rapid (maximal binding by 1 h), reversible (half-time of dissociation, approximately 40 min), and saturable. Curvilinear Scatchard plots were obtained, and vectorial analysis resolved both high and low affinity sites. The concentrations (femtomoles per 50 micrograms DNA) and dissociation constants (Kd) of both classes of sites were different between N and L bird cells. Values of these receptor parameters for N and L cockerel cells were, respectively, as follows: concentrations of low affinity sites, 7.45 and 11.60; concentrations of high affinity sites, 3.16 and 5.50; Kd of low affinity sites, 2.05 X 10(-8) and 2.58 X 10(-9) M; Kd of high affinity sites, 1.01 X 10(-9) and 1.27 X 10(-10) M. Thus, the overall binding capacity of L bird cells was 65% greater than that of N bird cells. In addition, the overall affinity (1/Kd) of sites of L bird cells was 9 times that of sites of N bird cells. These data indicate that persistent protein malnutrition in the domestic fowl increased both the number and affinity of adrenocortical cell ACTH receptors.\r"

The obese Zucker rat (fa/fa) has decreased total and free serum T3 concentrations, but normal serum T4 concentrations, compared to those in their lean littermates. To elucidate the mechanism of these differences, we measured the MCR and production rate (PR) of T4 and T3 in the three genotypes of 4-month-old male Zucker rats (Fa/Fa, Fa/fa, and fa/fa). In addition, 5'-deiodinase activity in liver, kidney, and brown adipose tissue homogenates was determined. T4 MCRs were equivalent in all three genotypes, but a decreased T3 MCR was seen in Fa/fa and fa/fa rats. An additive effect of the fa gene was noted with respect to the decrease in T3 MCR (Fa/Fa, 42.0 +/- 1.5; Fa/fa, 38.7 +/- 2.4; fa/fa, 34.7 +/- 3.4 ml/h; P less than 0.05). Whole body T4 PRs were equal in all three genotypes, but the T3 PR was decreased in the fa/fa rat by 25% compared to that in the homozygous lean rats (15.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 21.2 +/- 2.4 ng/h; P less than 0.005). Liver and kidney 5'-deiodinase activities were decreased in the fa/fa rat by 34% (P less than 0.005) and 20% (P less than 0.01), respectively. Brown adipose tissue and pituitary 5'-deiodinase activity were similar in all three genotypes. These results show a reduction in T3, but not T4, MCR in obese Zucker rats. Whole body T3 production and type I 5'-deiodinase activity were decreased in the obese (fa/fa) rats. These results suggest that decreased T4 to T3 conversion is responsible for the decreased T3 production rate in the fatty rat and may contribute to its obesity.\r"

  ".W": "The single insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene is transcribed into multiple RNA species in most fetal and neonatal rat tissues. For IGF-II to serve as a local growth factor in fetal tissues, IGF-II RNA must be translated into pre-pro-rat (r) IGF-II, and the biosynthetic precursor processed to smaller biologically active forms. IGF-II RNA extracted from fetal rat liver, muscle, intestine, lung, and stomach, from rat placenta, and from fetal or neonatal mouse liver and lung directed the synthesis of 22,000 mol wt pre-pro-IGF-II in a reticulocyte lysate cell-free translation system. A biosynthetic precursor of this size had been observed previously in translation of RNA from BRL-3A rat liver cells and is predicted by the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones encoding rIGF-II. Consistent with the developmental pattern of expression of IGF-II RNA observed in hybridization studies, RNA from adult rat liver, muscle, and intestine did not direct the synthesis of pre-pro-rIGF-II. To determine whether the IGF-II biosynthetic precursor was processed to smaller biologically active IGF-II, term fetal rat tissues were extracted with acid-ethanol, the extracts were fractionated by acid gel filtration, and the IGF pools were examined in a RIA specific for IGF-II. Levels of 1-2 micrograms/g were observed in liver, limb, lung, intestine, and brain; lower levels were observed in heart and kidney. In general, the levels of immunoreactive IGF-II corresponded to the levels of IGF-II mRNA. These results suggest that IGF-II mRNA is translated, and pre-pro-IGF-II processed to mature IGF-II in different fetal rat tissues. In contrast to IGF-I, in which alternative RNA splicing generates possible precursor molecules containing different COOH-terminal propeptide segments, we find no evidence for an IGF-II precursor in rat tissues other than 22,000 mol wt pre-pro-rIGF-II.\r"

  ".W": "Activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGDH) were measured in the mediobasal hypothalamus and pituitary gland of C57BL/6J mice throughout their lifespan. Activities of pituitary G6PDH, pituitary 6-PGDH, and hypothalamic G6PDH increase with age in female mice, assayed 7 days after ovariectomy, but not in intact females or males. Pituitary G6PDH specific activity is increased by middle-age (13-14 months) in females, before the onset of acyclicity, and remains elevated throughout the acyclic phases of persistent vaginal cornification and persistent diestrus. This increase in activity is ovary dependent, because it can be prevented by long term (12-month) ovariectomy. The increased activity is not linked to pituitary tumorigenesis and does not result from trapped blood cells, as evaluated by studies with 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes. Responses to physiological levels of estradiol (E2) were analyzed with a graded series of chronic polyethylene implants or after a single sc injection in ovariectomized mice aged 5-22 months. The responsiveness of pituitary G6PDH to E2 is not altered during aging. Young cycling (6 months old) and older acyclic mice (19 months old) displaying persistent vaginal cornification show equivalent increases of about 100% in G6PDH specific activity after chronic E2 treatment and similar time courses of induction after a single E2 injection. Pituitary G6PDH is maximally induced (30% increase) by 48 h after E2 injection in all age groups. In addition, the rates of decline in pituitary G6PDH specific activity after ovariectomy are similar in young and older mice (half-life, 4 days). The specific activity of G6PDH in the mediobasal hypothalamus and blood is unaffected by E2 administration. The relatively low doses of E2 used here fail to alter 6-PGDH specific activity in pituitary or brain. These findings indicate that female reproductive senescence in mice is not associated with generalized losses of sensitivity and responsivity to E2 throughout the neuroendocrine axis.\r"

The factor structure of the WAIS-R was examined in this study in a sample of 107 patients with various seizure disorders. The results of this study revealed the 3-factor solution, as has been reported in many previous studies. The most notable difference was the relatively greater prominence of the Freedom from Distractibility factor. These results are consistent with studies of the factor structure of previous editions of the Wechsler Scales in samples of epileptic patients. The relative prominence of the Distractibility factor could suggest that attentional factors are a more important influence on performance than in other patient groups. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of various seizure-related variables on patterns of intelligence.\r"

We recently adopted a modified protocol of prolonged, electrocerebral silent BC to treat patients with chronic seizure activity resistant to multiple regimens of antiepileptic drugs. Four patients, aged 4 months to 10 years, with long-standing intractable generalized seizures were treated. Seizure frequency ranged from one to two to numerous times per day. Following BC, one patient has been seizure free during 8 months of follow-up, and another has had only two seizures in 18 months. A 4-month-old infant was seizure-free for 2 weeks after BC and then died from underlying CNS disease. A 10-year-old girl died during BC from shock and hyperpyrexia. The results obtained in our patients indicate that prolonged electrocerebral silent BC may exert a beneficial long-term effect in treatment of intractable seizure disorders. This procedure might also be beneficial in other forms of epilepsy.\r"

The study was divided into two phases: Phase I determined Vmax (mg/kg/day) and Km (microgram/ml) of PHT in order to calculate the PHT doses needed for the second phase. Phase II was a four-way cross-over study to examine the effect of 1 and 5 mg FA on total serum PHT concentrations 1 microgram/ml less and 5 micrograms/ml greater than the subject's Km, Km-1 and Km+5, respectively. Both phases examined the effect of PHT on serum folate. In Phase I, serum folate decreased by a mean and standard deviation of 42.15 +/- 21.44% after an average of 24.15 +/- 5.63 days of PHT administration, with a mean steady-state total serum PHT concentration of 8.45 +/- 2.70 micrograms/ml. Mean percentage decreases in serum folate before the addition of 1 and 5 mg FA in Phase II were 12.80 +/- 31.45% and 23.24 +/- 21.24% for Km-1 and Km+5, respectively. The average numbers of days of PHT administration and total serum PHT concentrations before FA administration were 9.52 +/- 3.34 and 15.84 +/- 7.02 days, and 2.60 +/- 2.18 and 8.64 +/- 3.44 micrograms/ml, for Km-1 and Km+5, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During performance of a recent memory task by a patient with uncontrolled complex partial seizures and implanted electrodes, visually presented stimuli consistently evoked focal medial temporal lobe interictal SWC with an average latency of 228 +/- 29 ms. The SWC were more often lateralized to the left medial temporal lobe. No consistent change in interictal spike rate was observed during performance of several other cognitive tasks during which visual or auditory stimuli were presented. This suggests that performance of specific cognitive tasks--in this case, recognition memory of words--can trigger interictal SWC.\r"

The anticonvulsant profile of LY 188544 after intraperitoneal administration to mice was determined in standard anticonvulsant tests: maximal electric shock (MES), strychnine tonic-extensor, and threshold tests using pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin, and bicuculline. In this series of tests, LY 188544 had good activity in the MES test and some activity in the three threshold tests. Thus, its profile of activity was most similar to that of phenobarbital, and less similar to that of phenytoin and carbamazepine. After oral administration to mice and rats, LY188544 was effective in the MES test, but did not provide complete protection in the threshold pentylenetetrazol test. When the individual stereoisomers, LY188545 (S isomer) and LY188546 (R isomer), were evaluated after oral administration, LY188545 was 2.2 times more potent than LY188546 against MES-induced seizures. However, when evaluated after intravenous administration, the potency difference was only 1.1. LY188546 was the least toxic in terms of neurological impairment. All compounds had good protective indexes (ratio between doses for neurological impairment and doses for anticonvulsant efficacy in the MES test). LY188545 and LY188546 potentiated hexobarbital sleeping time after acute administration but not after chronic (4-day) administration. Tolerance did not develop to the effects of LY188546 on MES or neurological impairment after 4 days of administration. These results suggest that LY188546 is a chemically novel anticonvulsant with a promising pharmacological profile.\r"

Doses of 0.31 and 0.625 mg significantly stimulated hepatic globulins. This stimulatory effect ranged from being 1.5 to 8 times greater than the effects of comparable doses of estrone sulfate and conjugated equine estrogens. A significant stimulation in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol occurred with as little as 0.15 mg of EqS. Elevations in the high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio occurred with EqS, which resulted in an approximately 4-fold greater response than that achieved with comparable doses of conjugated equine estrogens. The fasting urinary calcium/creatinine ratio was only significantly lowered with 0.625 mg of EqS and was less potent than conjugated equine estrogens in this regard. It is concluded that EqS is a potent estrogen that contributes significantly to the hepatic stimulatory effects of conjugated equine estrogens. These data also provide support for the suggestion that there may be a dissociation in potency between estrogenic effects on liver and bone.\r"

This study concludes that significant emotional maladjustment is no more prevalent in women coping with infertility than for the general population of women. Results from this investigation cast doubt on the historical assumption that stress may be a causal factor in infertility.\r"

Only the number of sperm in the insemination medium, percentage normal morphology, and vitality were statistically significant in logistic regression models of fertilization rates. The other tests, such as the hypo-osmotic swelling test, did not give additional information about fertilization rates in this study. It is concluded that logistic regression analysis of factors affecting results of fertilization in vitro provides a powerful tool for evaluating some clinical tests of sperm function.\r"

Depending on the cell stage, 61% to 81% of embryos survived cryostorage, but 2-cell embryos did not implant. One fifth of cryoinjury was due to the formation of cracks in the zona pellucida. The incidence of implantation was not enhanced when more than one freeze/thawed embryo was replaced, most pregnancies being obtained from single embryo replacements. At least 8% more births are expected in addition to conventional in vitro fertilization methods when the current policy of replacing three fresh embryos and freezing the remainder using this technique is applied. This method will result in two to four times more pregnancies per spare embryo, compared with other cryopreservation methods using older embryos.\r"

The control patients were treated identically, except they received no CC. CC cycles were more uniform in duration and follicular response better, enabling a prescheduled IVF regimen. Control cycles were complicated by poor follicular response or untimely endogenous surges of luteinizing hormone (LH). The mean urinary estrone glucuronide excretion per follicle was the same in each group, and there was no evidence of a luteal defect by either luteal phase length or urinary pregnanediol excretion. Although there were minor differences in mitotic rate and basal vacuolation of glandular epithelium in biopsies, no specific deleterious effect of CC could be seen.\r"

Semen samples were obtained from volunteers who were attending the fertility outpatient clinic. Sperm motility was measured on a video recorder with a built-in timer, sperm penetration by the Kremer test, and ATP by bioluminescence assay. The addition of 19-hydroxy prostaglandin (PG) E to ejaculates positively stimulated sperm motility and sperm penetration capacity. The opposite effect was observed with 19-hydroxy PGF. PGE1, PGE2, and PGF2 alpha had no effect on either parameter, while PGF1 alpha reduced the sperm motility. The addition of 19-hydroxy PGE to ejaculates increased and the addition of 19-hydroxy PGF reduced semen concentrations of ATP. However, only the last-mentioned effect was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). It is suggested that, in particular, 19-hydroxy PGE and 19-hydroxy PGF are important regulators of sperm motility and that the effect may be mediated via effects on the ATP content in the spermatozoa.\r"

However, only the spermatozoa selected from discontinuous Nycodenz gradients retained their motility for at least 21 hours (60% motility compared with 5% motility). A significantly higher number of motile spermatozoa were harvested from discontinuous Nycodenz gradients than from matched control samples using the swim-up procedure (12.0 +/- 3.0 standard error of the mean [SEM] X 10(6)/ml versus 1.9 +/- 0.7 SEM X 10(6)/ml; 27 experiments, P less than 0.001).

In eutopic endometria, ER staining in both stromal and epithelial cells increased and decreased synchronously during the cycle, but in endometriotic lesions, such synchrony was lacking. Moreover, in lesions, unlike endometria, the percentage of ER+ cells was low in the stroma and highly variable in epithelium throughout the cycle. These data, taken together, indicate a defect in the hormonal regulation of ER in endometriotic lesions of monkeys.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating precursors of mucosal immunoglobulin A plasma cells and T-cell immunoblasts migrate selectively into mucosal sites from the blood, but the mechanisms controlling this selective trafficking have not been determined. One possibility is that the site-specific extravasation of circulating effector cell populations is determined by organ-specific endothelial cell recognition mechanisms. Here we have assessed the ability of isolated mouse gut intraepithelial lymphocytes to recognize and bind to mucosal versus nonmucosal lymphoid organ high endothelial venules, vessels that support high levels of lymphocyte traffic in vivo. In an in vitro assay of lymphocyte interaction with high endothelial venules in frozen sections, intraepithelial leukocytes bind well to high endothelial venules in Peyer's patches but, unlike most circulating B and T lymphocytes, are unable to interact with peripheral lymph node high endothelial venules. Furthermore, we show by in situ immunohistology and in cell suspension immunofluorescence studies that intraepithelial leukocytes fail to stain with a monoclonal antibody, MEL-14, against putative lymphocyte receptors for lymph node high endothelial venules. Thus, they lack a cell surface glycoprotein required for homing to peripheral nodes. The demonstration of organ-specific recognition of endothelial cells by a normal mucosal effector lymphocyte population suggests that selective interactions with endothelium may play an important role in controlling the distribution of effector cells in vivo. The utilization of organ-specific endothelial cell recognition mechanisms by circulating precursors of mucosal effector cells could explain both the unification of immune responses in diverse mucosal sites and the physiologic segregation of mucosal from nonmucosal immune mechanisms.\r"

Fractional cholesterol absorption varied from 0.1% to 70%, and was lowest in jejunoileal bypass (8.3%) associated with severe fat and moderate bile acid malabsorptions and in 15 patients with a long small-intestinal resection (20.4%) associated with severe bile acid and moderate fat malabsorption. Seven resected patients with normal fecal fat and bile acids and 8 resected patients with malabsorption of only bile acid had normal cholesterol absorption. Low fractional cholesterol absorption was associated with a short length of the remaining proximal small intestine, high dietary intake of plant sterol, and high fecal fat and neutral sterol excretions, but not with bile acid malabsorption. In the whole study population, plasma levels of total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were positively correlated with fractional cholesterol absorption and the amount of total, dietary, and biliary absorbed cholesterol and were negatively correlated with fecal cholesterol elimination as neutral sterols (less so as bile acids) and cholesterol synthesis. The results emphasize that, in patients with ileal exclusion, plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are regulated more effectively by cholesterol than by bile acid malabsorption. Moreover, although the fecal loss of bile acids is the main determinant in cholesterol elimination and stimulation of cholesterol synthesis in patients with intestinal exclusions, intestinal cholesterol absorption also contributes noticeably to the regulation of cholesterol synthesis.\r"

The motility patterns of 4 dogs were studied before and after resection of the entire duodenum with reimplantation of bile and pancreatic ducts. Before duodenectomy, plasma concentrations of motilin and pancreatic polypeptide varied cyclically with the migrating motor complex. After duodenectomy, the migrating motor complex was abolished in the stomach in 3 of the 4 dogs during fasting. The other dog demonstrated what appeared to be an intermittent cyclic increase in gastric contractile activity, but with markedly abnormal characteristics and at irregular intervals. The jejunal migrating motor complex continued to cycle after duodenectomy in all 4 dogs, but the mean period was shorter than before duodenectomy (83 min vs. 147 min, p less than 0.01). Duodenectomy abolished the cyclic variations of plasma motilin and pancreatic polypeptide and lowered the concentration of both peptides during all phases. This study suggests that the duodenum plays an important role in the initiation of the gastric migrating motor complex and in the coordination of interdigestive gastrointestinal motor activity, possibly by the release of motilin.\r"

The binding of agonists and of antagonists was assessed by displacement of [3H]N-methylscopolamine. Pirenzepine (M1-antagonist) labeled low-affinity binding sites in smooth muscle (KD = 229 nM) and in mucosa (KD = 124 nM) consistent with the presence of M2 sites. Carbachol interacted with a high-affinity (KD = 164 nM) and a low-affinity (KD = 18.2 microM) state of binding sites in smooth muscle. Guanyl 5'-yl-imidodiphosphate converted all sites to the low-affinity state. N-ethylmaleimide pretreatment increased the affinity of carbachol and the proportion of high-affinity sites. In clear contrast, only low-affinity sites of carbachol were detectable in mucosa (KD = 17 microM) that were not modulated by N-ethylmaleimide or guanyl 5'-yl-imidodiphosphate. The cardioselective antagonist AF-DX 116 displayed low affinity to mucosal binding sites (KD = 3.4 microM), whereas its affinity to smooth muscle was 503 nM. The antagonist hexahydro-sila-difenidol had a very high affinity (KD = 2.9 nM) to mucosal receptors, whereas its affinity to smooth muscle sites was 88 nM. These data show that muscarinic M2 binding sites in mucosa and smooth muscle can be distinguished by both agonist and antagonist binding experiments, and suggest the existence of different subtypes of M2-binding sites in these tissues.\r"

When studied in vivo, Y. enterocolitica infection resulted in decreased water and electrolyte absorption in the jejunum under basal conditions and in both jejunum and ileum in the presence of glucose. Glucose absorption was also decreased in jejunum and ileum. When studied in vitro, net basal Na+ and Cl- transport was not altered in jejunal or ileal epithelium from infected animals. Glucose-stimulated Na+ absorption was decreased in ileal epithelium, and absorption of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose was decreased in both jejunum and ileum. Secretory capacity of Cl-, as assessed by isobutylmethyl xanthine stimulation, was unimpaired in both jejunum and ileum. Decreased food intake alone, in the pair-fed animals, had little effect on intestinal transport. The results indicate that malabsorption, rather than active intestinal secretion, is the major small intestinal transport defect in acute Y. enterocolitica infection. Furthermore, the abnormalities can be directly attributed to injury induced by the organism itself, rather than malnutrition.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine whether luminal perfusion with 1 microM FMLP alters microvascular permeability, blood flow, and neutrophil migration in the small intestine of control rats and rats treated with antineutrophil serum. Microvascular permeability to total plasma proteins was determined from an analysis of lymphatic protein fluxes. Myeloperoxidase activity was used as an index of tissue neutrophil count. Intestinal blood flow was measured using radiolabeled microspheres and the reference blood sample method. In control rats, luminal perfusion with FMLP caused significant increases in blood flow, lymph flow, lymph protein clearance, and microvascular permeability, but it did not alter tissue myeloperoxidase activity. In rats treated with antineutrophil serum, tissue myeloperoxidase levels were reduced by approximately 55%, and the FMLP-induced changes in lymph flow, lymph protein clearance, and microvascular permeability were significantly attenuated. In vitro experiments with isolated rat neutrophils revealed that 1 microM FMLP elicits significant chemotaxis and degranulation yet minimally enhances superoxide production. The results of this study indicate that peptides produced by microorganisms in the gut lumen can increase intestinal microvascular permeability. The FMLP-induced alterations in microvascular exchange appear to be mediated by activated neutrophils.\r"

Resected animals (70% proximal jejunoileal resection) receiving an EFA-deficient diet had a significantly impaired intestinal mucosal hyperplasia response in all remaining small bowel segments compared with resected controls. The effect of refeeding a control diet to clinically EFA-deficient resected rats was also evaluated. Short-term refeeding (2 wk) of a control diet resulted in a significant return toward normal tissue triene to tetraene ratios. Concomitantly, refed animals had significantly greater mucosal adaptation in the remaining duodenal/jejunal segment compared with resected animals maintained on an EFA-deficient diet postoperatively. These experiments underscore the dynamic nature of tissue EFA status and the importance of fatty acids in the normal compensatory mechanisms of mucosal adaptation after resection.\r"

The decline was greatest for men with duodenal ulcer, less for men and women with gastric ulcer, and least for women with duodenal ulcer. These trends were established long before the introduction of H2-receptor drug therapy in 1977. In contrast to elective operations, the incidence of emergent operations remained at about 10/100,000 population per year. Perhaps because of an increasing proportion of emergency operations, overall survival appeared to worsen from the first decade of study to the last; but, after adjustment for age at operation and sex, no difference in survival over time was detected.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue pH in the immediate subepithelial layer of rat gastric mucosa was measured using H+-selective microelectrodes. Exposure of the mucosa to luminal acid (50-150 mM) caused a significant acidification of the subepithelial tissue. Contrary to expectation, disruption of the mucosal barrier with taurocholate (10 mM), acetylsalicylic acid (10 mM), or ethanol (20% vol/vol) during acid (100 mM HCl) perfusion promoted no further acidification of the subepithelial tissue but rather caused an alkalinization of the primarily acidified subepithelial tissue. When hemorrhagic shock was induced during acid perfusion, a profound acidification of the subepithelial tissue occurred even though a much lower luminal acidity (10 mM HCl) was used. Also, taurocholate had no alkalinizing influence on subepithelial pH during hemorrhagic shock, but caused a rapidly progressing and irreversible drop of the subepithelial tissue pH. The findings suggest that in normal stomach with intact \"mucosal barrier,\" H+ back-diffusion occurs during exposure to acid. However, disruption of the mucosal barrier seems to lead to alkali (HCO3-) efflux from the mucosa, which neutralizes the influxing H+, thus \"masking\" H+ back-diffusion and protecting the mucosa. Yet, when adequate supply of HCO3- to the mucosa is blocked during exposure to a barrier-breaking agent and acid, increased H+ back-diffusion becomes again \"unmasked,\" leading to extensive acidification and ulceration of the mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the relation between ethanol-induced microvascular and absorptive changes, we have investigated the effect of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 on the jejunal intraluminal plasma albumin loss (which was taken as a measure of microvascular changes) and the inhibition of water, sodium, and glucose transport caused by intraluminal ethanol. A group of 8 dogs received intravenously 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 at a dose of 0.1 microgram/kg as a bolus followed by 0.05 microgram/kg.hour for 2 h (prostaglandin-treated group). A second group of 8 dogs received no 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (untreated group). In each dog of both groups, one jejunal segment was perfused with an ethanol-free solution (control segment) and an adjacent segment was perfused with the same solution containing 6% (wt/vol) ethanol (ethanol-perfused segment). The albumin loss (mg/g dry gut wt.90 min, mean +/- SE) by the control and the ethanol-perfused segments was 0.76 +/- 0.23 and 8.29 +/- 1.27, respectively, in the untreated group, and 0.66 +/- 0.23 and 4.81 +/- 0.67, respectively, in the prostaglandin-treated group. The ethanol-induced increase in albumin loss was significant in both groups, but was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in the prostaglandin-treated group than in the untreated group. Intraluminal ethanol depressed net water, sodium, and glucose transport by 74%, 52%, and 22%, respectively, in the untreated group, and by 92%, 65%, and 38%, respectively, in the prostaglandin-treated group. The magnitude of this depression did not differ significantly between the two groups. As 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 attenuated the ethanol-induced plasma albumin loss, but not the inhibition of water, sodium, or glucose transport, we conclude that the microvascular and the absorptive changes produced by ethanol are not mediated by the same mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to examine the effect of serum glucose concentration on interdigestive gastrointestinal motility and plasma motilin levels in humans. Motility studies were performed for a 3-h baseline period and a 3-h test period during which serum glucose levels were maintained with a glucose clamp at 250, 175, 140, or 120 mg/dl. During the basal recording, three phases of the interdigestive migrating motor complex (MMC) were easily recognizable, with a mean cycle duration of 97 +/- 12 min. Plasma motilin levels fluctuated in phase with the MMC. Gastric contractions were nearly absent at a serum glucose level of 250 mg/dl and markedly reduced at 175 and 140 mg/dl. Gastric phase III activity was inhibited during these infusions. Gastric contractions and phase III activity were not affected by glucose infusion at 120 mg/dl. In contrast, the frequency of duodenal phase III activity was unchanged at all levels of glucose infusion. Mean motilin levels were significantly reduced during glucose infusion at 250 and 175 mg/dl (p less than 0.05), but not at 140 and 120 mg/dl. We conclude that hyperglycemia inhibits the occurrence of the MMC in the stomach and suppresses plasma motilin levels. The differential sensitivity of motility and motilin concentration to different degrees of hyperglycemia suggests that hyperglycemia can inhibit antral motility independent of plasma motilin. In contrast, the duodenal MMC appears to be insensitive to hyperglycemia. This suggests that the antral and duodenal MMCs are mediated by different mechanisms. Our observations indicate the importance of serum glucose in regulating gastric motility.\r"

The release of PP from the dorsal part of the rat pancreas by GRP and carbachol was also studied. Carbachol and GRP stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) M, PP secretion from the ventral part of the pancreas. Maximum responses were observed with 10(-7) to 10(-8) M carbachol and 10(-7) M GRP. The response with 10(-7) M carbachol was biphasic and was abolished by 10(-5) M atropine. The response with 10(-7) M GRP, however, was transient, monophasic, and not inhibited by atropine. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (10(-7) M) stimulated a weak PP secretion that was not inhibited by atropine. The potency of GRP and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide relative to carbachol at 10(-7) M was 24% and 7%, respectively. Neuromedin C had almost the same bioactivity as GRP with respect to the release of PP, whereas neuromedin B was one-third less potent than GRP and neuromedin C. The relative secretion of PP from the dorsal compared with the ventral part of the pancreas after stimulation by 10(-7) M carbachol and GRP was 19% and 22%, respectively. These data show that peptidergic nerves may play some role in PP secretion. In addition, the main source of PP to the systemic circulation may be the ventral part of the pancreas.\r"

Acetate is nontoxic in contrast to C(3)4-C6 fatty acids, which induce coma in animals and have been reported to be of importance in the development of hepatic coma in humans. An in vitro fecal incubation system was used to demonstrate how blood, hemoglobin, albumin, lactulose, galactose, fructose, and glucose influence short-chain fatty acid production in the colon. Blood, hemoglobin, and albumin caused increased production of all C2-C6 fatty acids, with the most pronounced increase (fourfold) in C4-C6 fatty acids. Lactulose was converted to acetate only, as were its monosaccharide components, D-galactose and D-fructose. In assays incubated with blood, the production of C4-C6 fatty acids was completely inhibited by lactulose, D-galactose, D-fructose, and D-glucose, respectively, whereas the production of acetate was increased. Lactulose thus \"detoxified\" the profile of short-chain fatty acids produced in the presence of blood and proteins, indicating that colonic fermentative bacteria prefer lactulose to blood when both substrates are available. The effect of lactulose in the treatment of hepatic coma caused by episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding may therefore be due to a shift in bacterial metabolism from blood or proteins, or both, to lactulose in the colon, resulting in a simultaneous reduction in toxic nitrogenous and organic acid products.\r"

The common bile duct was transected and a catheter was inserted through each end. The exteriorized catheters were connected to a photometric drop-flow meter. During phase III activity, bile entered the duodenum in single drops, only in between two consecutive contractions, or as a series of drops during transient inhibition of duodenal contractions by antral phase III contractions. During phase II activity bile also entered the duodenum, usually in between contractions or when the duodenum was intermittently quiescent. Bile entered the duodenum during a duodenal contraction only when the contraction amplitude was less than 15% +/- 1% (mean +/- SE) of the maximal amplitude during phase III contractions. Bile flow into the duodenum showed a cyclic pattern with a peak during late duodenal phase II activity and a trough during duodenal phase I activity only when phase III activity originated in the duodenum and migrated caudad. There was no cyclic pattern of bile flow when phase III activity originated in the proximal jejunum and migrated caudad. The total volume of bile flow in a migrating motor complex cycle and bile flow rate were greater when phase III activity started in the proximal jejunum than when it started in the duodenum. We conclude that gastroduodenal contractions play an important role in the regulation of bile flow into the duodenum. The cyclic pattern of bile flow is altered when phase III activity starts ectopically in the jejunum.\r"

Inhibition by asialoorosomucoid and the requirement for the presence of calcium indicated that the binding of secretory IgA and polymeric IgA1 was mediated by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Secretory component, which functions as a receptor for polymeric IgA in several animal species, was detected in the epithelial cells of bile ducts, but not in hepatocytes. Secretory IgA and all molecular forms and subclasses of serum IgA were bound by HepG2 cells, which do not express secretory component. The requirement for the presence of calcium, the presence of a terminal galactose residue in IgA, and the molecular weight of the major plasma membrane protein responsible for binding (41,700 daltons) indicated the involvement of asialoglycoprotein receptor. Immunoglobulin A proteins bound by HepG2 cells were endocytosed and catabolized.\r"

We have measured serum and hepatic kinetics for 75SeHCAT, and compared them with those for the conventional hepatobiliary scintigraphic agent 99mTc-hepatoiminodiacetic acid, and with serum kinetics for the corresponding natural bile acid, [14C]cholic acid-taurine. We used a dynamic scintigraphic technique and serial blood sampling in 8 subjects. Initial hepatic uptake rate was identical to initial serum disappearance rate (14% dose/min) for 75SeHCAT, but significantly lower for 99mTc-hepatoiminodiacetic acid (6% vs. 14% dose/min, p less than 0.001). Hepatic transit time was shorter for 75SeHCAT (13 min vs. 22 min, p less than 0.02), net hepatic excretory rate was more rapid (1.4% vs. 0.8% dose/min, p less than 0.001), and urinary excretion was lower (1.0% vs. 9.0% dose, p less than 0.001). Initial and late-plasma disappearance rates were significantly lower for 75SeHCAT (14.3% and 1.5% dose/min) than for [14C]cholic acid-taurine (21.3% and 2.8% dose/min, respectively), and plasma clearance was also lower (275 vs. 670 ml/min). In vitro, 75SeHCAT was bound to serum proteins more completely than [14C]cholic acid-taurine (90.4% vs. 86.5%, p less than 0.005). We conclude that 75SeHCAT provides a hepatoscintigraphic agent that is handled more efficiently and specifically by the liver than the conventionally used agent 99mTc-hepatoiminodiacetic acid. It is not cleared from the serum as rapidly as [14C]cholic acid-taurine, probably due to its stronger protein binding. The clinical value of 75SeHCAT in assessing liver disease should be investigated.\r"
