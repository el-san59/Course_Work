  ".W": "Glutamate is taken up avidly by glial cells in the central nervous system. Glutamate uptake may terminate the transmitter action of glutamate released from neurons, and keep extracellular glutamate at concentrations below those which are neurotoxic. We report here that glutamate evokes a large inward current in retinal glial cells which have their membrane potential and intracellular ion concentrations controlled by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. This current seems to be due to an electrogenic glutamate uptake carrier, which transports at least two sodium ions with every glutamate anion carried into the cell. Glutamate uptake is strongly voltage-dependent, decreasing at depolarized potentials: when fully activated, it contributes almost half of the conductance in the part of the glial cell membrane facing the retinal neurons. The spatial localization, glutamate affinity and magnitude of the uptake are appropriate for terminating the synaptic action of glutamate released from photoreceptors and bipolar cells. These data challenge present explanations of how the b-wave of the electroretinogram is generated, and suggest a mechanism for non-vesicular voltage-dependent release of glutamate from neurons.\r"

We recently reported cloning of the putative X-CGD gene on the basis of DNA linkage. To identify the predicted protein in vivo, antibodies were raised to a synthetic peptide derived from the complementary DNA sequence and to a fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli. In Western blots antisera detect a neutrophil protein of relative molecular mass in 90,000 (90K) that is absent in X-CGD patients. Antisera also react with the larger component of cytochrome b recently purified from neutrophil plasma membranes as a complex of glycosylated 90K and non-glycosylated 22K polypeptides. Based on our identification of the X-CGD protein in vivo, we propose that one of its critical roles is to interact with the 22K species to form a functional cytochrome b complex.\r"

This syndrome is most commonly inherited through a defect on the X chromosome and the only clearly defined component of the oxidase system, the very unusual cytochrome b (b-245), has been shown to be missing from the cells of these patients. This cytochrome is a heterodimer composed of an alpha-chain of relative molecular mass (Mr) 23,000 (23K) and a 76-92K beta-chain; neither are detectable in neutrophils from X-linked CGD subjects. The defective X-CGD gene has recently been cloned by 'reverse genetics' but the protein predicted from the proposed complementary DNA sequence was not identified. We have purified the beta-chain of the cytochrome and sequenced 43 amino acids from the N terminus. Almost complete homology was obtained between this sequence and that of the complementary nucleotides 19-147 of the sequence of the X-CGD gene, originally designated as a non-coding region.\r"

Loss of specific gene products from somatic cells may be critical in the origin or evolution of certain human tumours. Clues to identification of new loci of gene loss in common adult solid tumours may be found in literature that describes chromosomal abnormalities in rare heritable cancers. Karyotypes of tumours in two families with hereditary renal carcinoma showed translocations involving the short arm of chromosome 3 (refs 10 and 11). We have examined tumours from 18 patients with non-hereditary renal cell carcinomas and found loss of alleles at loci on the short arm of chromosome 3 in all eleven of the patients who could be evaluated.\r"

We have used mice with an X-autosomal translocation giving consistent non-random inactivation of the normal X (as judged by biochemical and cytogenetic techniques), that also carry a defective form of a histochemically demonstrable X-linked enzyme. When the gene for the normal enzyme was located on the inactivated normal X a uniformly negative histochemical picture would be predicted in doubly heterozygous animals. A very small proportion of enzyme-positive cells was found in young animals. This proportion increased very significantly with age, but the patch size did not change, showing that the result was not due to preferential division of enzyme-positive cells, but was instead due to the conversion of previously enzyme-negative to enzyme-positive cells. These observations provide the first evidence with a true X-linked gene for an age-related decrease in the stability of the X-inactivation mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Drosophila tissue culture cells stimulated by heat shock contain high levels of heat shock activator protein, which binds specifically to the heat-shock control DNA element. In contrast, nonshocked cells have low basal levels of binding activity. Here, we show that within 30 seconds of heat shock of intact cells the sequence-specific binding activity in whole cell extracts increases significantly, reaching a plateau by 5 min after the start of the shock; removal of the heat stimulus returns the activity to basal levels. Known chemical inducers of heat-shock genes elicit a similar pattern of specific binding activity. Moreover, this pattern is observed in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, even if the stimulus-withdrawal is repeated sequentially through five cycles. Our results are inconsistent with models which propose proteolysis as the chief means of mediating heat-shock transcriptional control. Rather, they suggest that heat shock activator pre-exists in normal cells in a nonbinding form, which is converted upon cell stimulus to a high affinity, sequence-specific binding form, most probably by a post-translational modification. This conversion may be crucial for the transcriptional activation of heat shock genes.\r"

  ".W": "Several neurotoxins have been isolated from bee venom. One of these, the mast cell degranulating peptide (MCD), releases histamine from mast cells and on central administration produces arousal at low concentrations and convulsions at higher doses. These effects are mediated through specific high-affinity binding sites which are concentrated in cortical structures, notably the hippocampus. This structure appears to be the source of changes in the electrocorticogram that follow injections of MCD into the cerebral ventricle, and which induce a quasi-permanent hippocampal theta rhythm in the motionless rat alternating with epileptiform spike waves. We report here that brief application of MCD to the CA1 region of hippocampal slices induces long-term potentiation, that is, a long-lasting increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission. This potentiation seems to be indistinguishable from the classical LTP produced by trains of high-frequency electrical stimulation and considered to be related in some way to memory. Using binding to synaptosomal membranes and radioimmunoassay techniques, we have also found an endogenous peptide equivalent of MCD in brain extracts. This raises the possibility that a MCD-like peptide may be important in long-term potentiation.\r"

  ".U": "87258206\r", 
  ".W": "The hippocampus receives a dense serotonin-containing innervation from the divisions of the raphe nucleus. Serotonin applied to hippocampal neurons to mimic the action of endogenous transmitter often produces complex and variable responses (see for example ref. 3). Using voltage-clamp methods and new ligands that are selective for subtypes of serotonin receptors, we have been able to clarify the mechanism of serotonin action on CA1 cells in rat hippocampal slices. We describe three distinct actions of serotonin (or 5-HT) on identified K-conductances in these cells. First, it activates a Ca-independent K-current which is responsible for neuronal hyperpolarization and is inhibitory. Second, it simultaneously suppresses the slow Ca-dependent K-conductance that is largely responsible for the accommodation of cell firing in CA1 neurons: this produces a paradoxical increase in neuronal discharge in response to a depolarizing input. Third, serotonin produces a more slowly developing and long-lasting suppression of an intrinsic voltage-dependent K-conductance, Im (ref. 9), leading to neuronal depolarization and excitation. The hyperpolarizing response is mediated by class 1A serotonin receptors, whereas the other responses are not. Modulation of these different conductances by endogenously released serotonin could therefore change the probability or the duration (or both) of neuronal firing in the mammalian brain in different ways to give inhibitory, excitatory or mixed effects.\r"

  ".W": "A prominent hypothesis in embryology is that localized maternal factors are important in specifying cell fate. There are, however, only a few examples of maternal molecules that have been shown to be localized and very little is known about how such factors are physically localized within an egg (for review see ref. 1). Previously, cDNA clones were obtained for a class of localized maternal mRNAs from Xenopus laevis. These mRNAs are unusual in that they are concentrated at either the animal or vegetal pole of unfertilized eggs. In the present study the synthesis and intracellular distribution of one of them, Vg1, has been examined during oogenesis. The results show that Vg1 mRNA is localized as a crescent at the vegetal pole of mature oocytes. Surprisingly, this mRNA is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of immature oocytes. These findings suggest that a single cell, the frog oocyte, has some mechanism for translocating specific RNAs like Vg1. The process that moves Vg1 mRNA is evidently a cytoplasmic localization machinery which is not directly coupled to the synthesis of Vg1 RNA.\r"

These mucin-type glycoproteins seem to be very immunogenic in rodents and, in a search for epithelial specific or tumour-associated antigens, a large number of related antibodies have been isolated which bind to the PUM-coded mucins. Many of the antibodies show a pronounced tumour specificity on immunohistology and are being used widely in cancer diagnosis in vitro and in vivo and even in cancer therapy. To investigate the expression of these antigens in normal and malignant cells complementary DNA coding for the mammary mucin has been isolated. Here we present evidence obtained using this cDNA that the PUM locus is a hypervariable 'minisatellite' region of human DNA similar to those described by several groups, but which is novel in that it is transcribed and translated, and that the same polymorphism is demonstrable in the expressed gene product.\r"

The polyomavirus early region is expressed in differentiated mouse cells but not in undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. This host range is a function of the enhancer because polyomavirus mutants selected for growth in EC cells have mutations in the enhancer and the host range is reproduced in transfection assays using the mutant enhancers. To understand the basis for this alteration in enhancer function, we have assayed extracts of EC cells for proteins that can interact with this sequence. We have detected a protein, present in a variety of cells, that can bind to the F441 mutant sequence, but binds only very poorly to the wild-type sequence. We conclude that this sequence alteration has probably generated a binding site for a positive-acting factor that allows the enhancer to function.\r"

  ".W": "The opening of base pairs of double-stranded DNA is an important process, being a prerequisite for replication and transcription and possibly a factor in the recognition, flexibility and structure of DNA. The kinetics of base-pair opening have, however, been controversial. Base-pair opening can be studied by following the exchange of protons from imino groups with water, a process that seems only to occur from open base pairs. We have recently demonstrated catalysis by proton acceptors of imino proton exchange in nucleic acids. This has enabled us to determine the base-pair lifetimes, which are in the region of 10 ms at room temperature. In earlier reports it had been considered that proton exchange is limited by the rate of base-pair opening, which had led to estimates of base-pair lifetimes that were larger by one or two orders of magnitude. There are also important discrepancies between recent and early estimates of the base-pair dissociation constant. Earlier estimates of base-pair lifetimes correspond in fact to the time required for proton exchange in the absence of added catalyst (AAC exchange). This could be a distinct mode of base-pair opening with a very long open lifetime, different from the mode revealed by the effect of catalyst. The evidence reported here suggests on the contrary that there is only a single mode of here suggests on the contrary that there is only a single mode of base-pair opening and that proton exchange in the absence of added catalyst is in fact catalysed by a proton acceptor intrinsic to the nucleic acid, most probably the other base of the open pair.\r"

They are present in the teeth of man and many other mammals, but absent in most insectivores and multituberculates. It has been suggested that the presence of HSB makes the tooth enamel less likely to split and is associated with chewing ability. We have traced the occurrence of HSB back to the arctonic condylarths of the early Palaeocene (Puercan) age; this must be close to the first appearance of the bands in placental mammals. Our data indicate that the teeth of almost all large mammals since the early Palaeocene have contained these bands, in an orientation that is optimal for limiting the propagation of vertical fractures. The appearance of the bands is associated with the differentiation of herbivores and carnivores from insectivores and our data indicate that their development was critical to the diversification of mammals because it allowed the use of new types of foods.\r"

  ".U": "87258228\r", 
  ".W": "Formation of myelinated tracts in central nervous system (CNS) regions such as the optic nerve seems to depend on two glial cell types, both of which derive from a common progenitor cell. This oligodendrocyte--type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cell gives rise to oligodendrocytes, which produce internodal myelin sheaths, and to type-2 astrocytes, which extend fine processes in the region of the nodal axolemma. The optic nerve also contains a third glial cell, the type-1 astrocyte, which derives from a separate precursor. These three glial cells develop in a fixed sequence over a two-week period: type-1 astrocytes appear at embryonic day 16 (E16), oligodendrocytes at the day of birth (E21 or postnatal day P0), and type-2 astrocytes between P8 and P10. Type-1 astrocytes secrete a potent mitogen which causes expansion of the O-2A progenitor cell population in vitro. Here, we report that dividing O-2A progenitor cells are highly motile and seem to migrate from the brain into the optic nerve, beginning at its chiasmal end. Our results indicate that long-distance migration along the neural axis is characteristic only of progenitors of the O-2A lineage and may serve to distribute these cells to regions of the CNS that will become myelinated. These results also suggest that the intrinsic neuroepithelial cells of the optic stalk may be even more restricted than previously thought, giving rise only to type-1 astrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Two theories of the molecular mechanism of volatile anaesthetic action suggest either that anaesthetics cause a generalized perturbation of neuronal membrane structure, probably through a nonspecific interaction with membrane lipids, or that anaesthetics bind to sets of sites of appropriate molecular dimension on membrane proteins. Based on the recent finding that fluorinated anaesthetics can be observed in animal tissue by 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (19F-NMR) spectroscopy, we have used 19F-NMR to quantify the interaction between the volatile anaesthetic halothane and rat brain tissue. Steady-state brain halothane concentration was found to be a non-linear function of inspired concentration, with apparent saturation of brain occurring at inspired halothane concentrations above 2.5% by volume. Using a spin-echo pulse sequence it was found that halothane exists in two distinct chemical environments in brain, characterized by different spin-spin relaxation times (T2), chemical shifts and kinetics of occupancy. Halothane concentration in one of these environments (T2 = 3.6 ms) was saturated at approximately 2.5% inspired halothane; occupancy of this environment was found to correlate with the anaesthetic effect of the drug. In the other environment (T2 = 43 ms), brain halothane concentration was a linear function of inspired concentration. These data suggest the existence of a saturable anaesthetic site for halothane in brain and do not support the concept that anaesthetics act by nonspecific membrane perturbation.\r"

Until relatively recently, there was no obvious mouse model of this genetic disease for the development of therapeutic strategies. The identification of a mouse X-linked mutant showing muscular dystrophy, mdx, has provided a candidate mouse genetic homologue to the DMD locus; the relatively mild pathological features of mdx suggest it may have more in common with mutations of the Becker muscular dystrophy type at the same human locus, however. But the close genetic linkage of mdx to G6PD and Hprt on the mouse X chromosome, coupled with its comparatively mild pathology, have suggested that the mdx mutation may instead correspond to Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which itself is closely linked to DNA markers at Xq28-qter in the region of G6PD on the human X chromosome. Using an interspecific mouse domesticus/spretus cross, segregating for a variety of markers on the mouse X chromosome, we have positioned on the mouse X chromosome sequences homologous to a DMD cDNA clone. These sequences map provocatively close to the mdx mutation and unexpectedly distant from sparse fur, spf, the mouse homologue of OTC (ornithine transcarbamylase) which is closely linked to DMD on the human X chromosome.\r"

To study how mutations in this gene affect muscle development and integrity, it would be of interest to have available a mouse model of the human disease. The mouse mdx mutation affects muscle and confers a mild dystrophic syndrome, but it is not clear whether this mutation is equivalent to Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy in man. Here we describe the use of two sequences from the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene that cross-hybridize to mouse X-linked sequences to localize the gene homologous to DMD in the mouse. Both sequences map to the region of 10 centimorgan lying between the Tabby (Ta) and St14-1 (DxPas8) loci, close to the phosphorylase b kinase locus (Phk). By analogy with the human X-chromosome, we conclude that the region in the mouse around the G6pd and St14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding to distinct human myopathies: Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which is known to be closely linked to St14-1 in man and the DMD homologue described here.\r"

  ".W": "Many hormones act on neuroendocrine cells by activating second messenger pathways. Two of these, the phosphoinositol and cAMP-dependent pathways, cause changes in cellular activity through specific protein kinases. By phosphorylating cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, these kinases apparently coordinate cellular processes, including the biosynthesis and release of neuropeptides. Somatostatin biosynthesis and release, for example, are both positively regulated by the second messenger cAMP in hypothalamic cells, and cAMP also induces somatostatin gene transcription 8-10-fold in transfected PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Transcriptional induction requires a 30-nucleotide cAMP response element (CRE) which is conserved in other cAMP-responsive genes. This element also confers cAMP responsiveness when placed upstream of the heterologous simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. The somatostatin gene does not, however, respond to cAMP in mutant PC12 cells which lack cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II activity. Activation of somatostatin gene transcription may consequently require the phosphorylation of a nuclear protein which binds to the CRE. Using a DNase I protection assay, we have characterized a nuclear protein in PC12 cells which binds selectively to the CRE in the somatostatin gene. We have purified this protein which is of relative molecular mass 43,000 (Mr 43K) by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. This 43K CRE binding protein (CREB) is phosphorylated in vitro when it is incubated with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Stimulating PC12 cells with forskolin, an activator of adenyl cyclase, causes a 3-4-fold increase in the phosphorylation of this protein. We conclude that the cAMP-dependent pathway may regulate gene transcription in response to hormonal stimulation by phosphorylating this CREB protein.\r"

Natural DNA sequences can have protein binding sites adjacent to A-tract bending sites, resulting in the potential for the formation of topologically complex shapes in a localized DNA regulatory domain. An essential first step in deducing the structure and functional significance of such domains is elucidation of the relative direction of bending, which can be determined from the electrophoretic mobilities of isomers having varied helical phasing between the bends. Taking DNA bent around CAP protein as a standard, we conclude that the junction bending model correctly predicts the direction of bending at A tracts in kinetoplast DNA. The overall direction of the bend is towards the minor groove at the centre of the A tract.\r"

Some fish, native to both subzero northern and southern waters, have special proteins or glycoproteins in their blood serum that inhibit ice formation. Whereas these proteins have only a very small effect on the melting temperature of ice, the temperature of these fish can fall to nearly 1 K below the melting point before ice crystals grow. This phenomenon is called freezing hysteresis, in contrast to the normal colligative effect of solutes that depresses the equilibrium temperature, around which small changes lead to crystal growth or melting depending on sign. Some insects also exhibit a serum freezing hysteresis. We report the effects of different degrees of supercooling on the habit and rates of growth of ice crystals from solutions of these antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs). We find that the crystallization rate is up to five times greater than that in pure water.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse embryogenesis relies on the presence of both the maternal and the paternal genome for development to term. It has been proposed that specific modifications are imprinted onto the chromosomes during gametogenesis; these modifications are stably propagated, and their expression results in distinct and complementary contributions of the two parental genomes to the development of the embryo and the extraembryonic membranes. Genetic data further suggest that a substantial proportion of the genome could be subject to chromosomal imprinting, the molecular nature of which is unknown. We used random DNA insertions in transgenic mice to probe the genome for modified regions. The DNA methylation patterns of transgenic alleles were compared after transmission from mother or father in seven mouse strains carrying autosomal insertions of the same transgenic marker. One of these loci showed a clear difference in DNA methylation specific for its parental origin, with the paternally inherited copy being relatively undermethylated. This difference was observed in embryos on day 10 of gestation, but not in their extraembryonic membranes. Moreover, the methylation pattern was faithfully reversed upon each germline transmission to the opposite sex. Our findings provide evidence for heritable molecular differences between maternally and paternally derived alleles on mouse chromosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Data derived from both pronuclear transplantation experiments and classical genetic experiments indicate that the maternal and paternal genetic contributions to the mammalian zygote nucleus do not function equivalently during subsequent development. These observations have been interpreted as resulting from differential 'genome imprinting' during male and female gametogenesis. The molecular mechanism responsible for genome imprinting is unknown, but data gathered to date require that the mechanism fulfill at least four criteria: (1) the imprint must be physically linked to the pronucleus; (2) the imprint must persist through DNA replication and cell division; (3) the mechanism must be capable of affecting gene expression; and (4) the mechanism must be capable of switching the identity of the imprint from one sex to the other in successive generations. One molecular mechanism which could satisfy the first three criteria is differential DNA methylation during gametogenesis itself, or before formation of the zygote nucleus during embryogenesis. We present data indicating that the methylation patterns of exogenous DNA sequences in transgenic mice can be changed by switching their gamete of origin in successive generations. These data suggest that DNA methylation can also satisfy the fourth criterion for an imprinting mechanism.\r"

The 246-base pair BclI-PvuII restriction enzyme fragment of polyoma virus has been shown to include two distinct enhancers, Py A and Py B, composed of several subdomains which interact with nuclear proteins from mouse fibroblasts. Embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells do not permit polyoma virus infection: both viral transcription and DNA replication are blocked. Host-range mutants of polyoma virus (EC mutants) capable of overcoming the expression block in EC cells have mutations or sequence rearrangements in their enhancer region. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis of this host restriction we compared the binding patterns displayed on the viral enhancer sequences by nuclear proteins prepared from EC cells or from fibroblasts. We show that one of the fibroblast factors required for Py A enhancer function, almost undetectable in EC cells, is induced after differentiation of these cells into parietal endoderm, suggesting that this protein is crucial in the regulation of viral gene expression during cellular differentiation, and perhaps more generally in the control of gene expression during early embryonic development.\r"

  ".W": "The guinea-pig perfused isolated lung, used in conjunction with the cascade superfusion system to measure the release of thromboxane A2(TXA2), is a simple and convenient model for assessing the inhibition by glucocorticoids of eicosanoid formation. Dexamethasone inhibits the release of TXA2 from the lung when it is stimulated by agents such as RCS-RF2 of leukotrienes, but not when bradykinin or arachidonic acid are used. Using this model we have shown that the glucocorticoids suppress eicosanoid generation by cells through the induction of a family of phospholipase A2-inhibitory proteins now termed the 'lipocortins'. Recently the primary structure of one form of lipocortin has been elucidated and the human gene cloned. Lipocortin 1 is a polar monomeric protein with anti-phospholipase properties in vitro and we now report that when infused into guinea-pig lung preparations this protein has the same inhibitory profile as the glucocorticoids but with a more rapid onset of action. This is the first demonstration that eicosanoid formation can be inhibited by a recombinant phospholipase inhibitory protein applied extracellularly.\r"

Receptor-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCs) were first postulated in smooth muscle by Bolton, van Breemen and Somlyo and Somlyo, but recordings of directly ligand-gated Ca2+ current are lacking. Here we describe receptor-operated Ca2+ current evoked in arterial smooth muscle cells by ATP, a sympathetic neurotransmitter. ATP activates channels with approximately 3:1 selectivity for Ca2+ over Na+ at near-physiological concentrations and with a unitary conductance of approximately 5 pS in 110 mM Ca2+ or Ba2+. The channels can be opened even at very negative potentials and resist inhibition by cadmium or nifedipine, unlike voltage-gated Ca2+ channels; they are not blocked by Mg2+, unlike NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-activated channels; they are directly activated by ligand, without involvement of readily diffusible second messengers, unlike cation channels in neutrophils and T lymphocytes. Thus, the ATP-activated channels provide a distinct mechanism for excitatory synaptic current and Ca2+ entry in smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The spectrin-based membrane skeleton, an assembly of proteins tightly associated with the plasma membrane, determines the shape and mechanical properties of erythrocytes. Spectrin, the most abundant component of this assembly, is an elongated and flexible molecule that, with potentiation by protein 4.1, is cross-linked at its ends by short actin filaments to form a lattice beneath the membrane. These and other proteins stabilize the plasma membrane, organize integral membrane proteins and maintain specialized regions of the cell surface. A membrane-skeleton-associated calmodulin-binding protein of erythrocytes is a major substrate for Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (ref. 5), and thus is a target for Ca2+ by two regulatory pathways. Here we demonstrate that this protein, called adducin: (1) binds tightly in vitro to spectrin-actin complexes but with much less affinity either to spectrin or to actin alone; (2) promotes assembly of additional spectrin molecules onto actin filaments; and (3) is inhibited in its ability to induce the binding of additional spectrin molecules to actin by micromolar concentrations of calmodulin and Ca2+. Adducin may be involved in the action of Ca2+ on erythrocyte membrane skeleton and in the assembly of spectrin-actin complexes.\r"

Statistical analysis confirmed that significant changes in these parameters are routine during aneurysm operation. Arbitrary definitions of abnormal latency and amplitude changes led to an excessive false-positive/false-negative rate. From the time of dural opening to the time of closure, prolongation of central conduction time, decrease in cortical amplitude, or disappearance of the EP was predictive of postoperative sensory or motor deficit in all patients monitored, except those undergoing operation on basilar artery aneurysms. In basilar aneurysm cases, outcome could not be reliably predicted with either EP technique.\r"

The malignant and atypical meningiomas are compared with the benign meningiomas, and special emphasis is placed on their computed tomographic features.

Of these, 205 were managed from 1968 through 1977 and 232 were managed from 1978 through early 1985 after a policy of early aneurysm operation had been implemented. Postoperative and management mortality and morbidity rates were related to the grade of the patient at the time of admission and the time interval before operation. Overall management mortality (and postoperative mortality) rates for patients treated before 1978 were 47% (19%) for all grades, 17% (12%) for Grades 1 and 2, 51% (25%) for Grades 3 and 4, and 100% (100%) for Grade 5. Since 1978, mortality has been reduced to 38% (11%) for all grades, 10% (5%) for Grades 1 and 2, 39% (17%) for Grades 3 and 4, and 96% (60%) for Grade 5. Management mortality for patients operated on Day 0 to 3 was lower than for those operated later after SAH both before and after 1978. Postoperative mortality was lowered in all patients operated from 1978 to 1985 regardless of the interval from SAH to operation, and management mortality was reduced overall, as well as for patients operated on day 0 to 3, in those treated from 1978 to 1985. The authors conclude that a policy of early aneurysm operation has contributed to a reduction of both postoperative and management mortality.\r"

Two of these holes were filled with collagen fleece (CF) and oxidized cellulose (OC), respectively, while the third was left empty as a control. The bleeding time was measured. Hemostasis with CF was statistically significantly faster than with OC, which in turn was statistically significantly faster than with no hemostatic agent. The animals were killed successively on Days 7, 14, 28, 42, and 241 after operation. Histopathological investigation showed that CF did not induce more tissue reaction that the control lesion and that CF was resorbed faster than OC. The removal of OC occurred from the borders of the material, moving gradually inward. With CF, there was an immediate ingrowth of reactive cells throughout the material. In contrast to OC, CF did not induce the formation of polynucleated giant cells. From these results, it can be concluded that CF is a fast, safe, and absorbable topical hemostatic agent suitable for use in neurosurgical procedures.\r"

The animals underwent a 60-g clip compression injury at T-1 for 1 minute. Fifteen minutes after injury, microspheres were used to measure cardiac output (CO) and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF). Each animal was then randomized into one of five groups. Four groups received intravenous infusions for 1 hour each of 5% albumin, autologous packed cells, low molecular weight dextran, or autologous whole blood to maintain the MSAP. The fifth group served as a control group and received an infusion of normal saline. Seventy-five minutes after injury, CO and SCBF were measured. The posttraumatic reduction in CO was significantly improved by all four treatment infusions. However, only autologous whole blood and dextran successfully reversed the posttraumatic hypotension. Dextran significantly elevated the CVP (P less than 0.01) and reduced the hematocrit (P less than 0.01). Whole blood improved SCBF in all segments of the spinal cord by nearly 100% (P less than 0.05), and dextran increased SCBF by 200% (P less than 0.01). Thus, the most marked improvements in MSAP, CO, and SCBF were produced by hypervolemia and hemodilution associated with dextran infusion. The therapeutic implications of this reversal of local and systemic changes in acute spinal cord injury are discussed.\r"

Experimentally induced hydromyelia was accompanied by a loss of lectin binding sites on the ependymal cells.

Computed tomography was performed in 19 patients and was valuable in preoperative planning and prognosis: intracerebral hematoma and intraventricular hemorrhage were associated with poor preoperative grade and the development of vasospasm. Operative management, case morbidity/mortality, and the high incidence of multiple aneurysms and other vascular anomalies associated with DACA aneurysms are discussed.

The clinical details of diagnosis and treatment in 13 patients with such lesions together with a review of 232 cases collected from the literature are presented in this report. There were 132 males, 77 females, and 36 cases in which the sex was not stated. Eighty patients presented as neonates, 82 were 1 to 12 months old, 39 were 1 to 5 years old, 22 were 6 to 20 years old, and 22 were over the age of 20. The most common presenting symptoms were congestive cardiac failure (110 cases), raised intracranial pressure secondary to hydrocephalus (94 cases), cranial bruit (57 cases), focal neurological deficit (37), seizures (26 cases), and hemorrhage (25 cases). The most characteristic vascular supply to the midline fistula involved multiple bilateral vessels, although bilateral posterior cerebral and unilateral posterior cerebral supply was relatively common. The overall figures for treatment and outcome showed that 91 patients (37.1%) were treated by direct operation and 29 patients (11.3%) were treated by other forms of operation, predominantly shunting or remote vessel ligation. Forty-six patients (18.8%) were treated by medical means (digoxin, diuretics, and ventilatory support). In 79 patients (22.2%), there was no treatment or no details of treatment were available. There was an overall series mortality of 55.6% (no details were available in 33 cases) and a 37.4% mortality for surgically treated cases. After operation, there was a 46.3% incidence of significant morbidity in surviving patients. Neonatal patients fared worst, with an overall mortality of 64 of 70 cases (91.4%) where details were available. The outcome was equally bad for surgically and conservatively treated cases. Operation in the 1- to 12-month age group was more successful, but still carried a mortality of 31.7%, with a significant morbidity in approximately half of the surviving patients. Over the age of 1 year, the surgically treated patients had a 25.6% mortality and a 42.3% major morbidity in survivors. Consideration is given to some of the ways in which these figures may be improved, in particular a staged approach during the neonatal period, with the use of selective embolization or occlusion of vessels to reduce the volume of the arteriovenous shunt until the patient is older and better able to tolerate major operation.\r"

Two patients with HFS in childhood and eight adults who had the onset of HFS before the age of 20 were treated with microvascular decompression of the facial nerve at the nerve root entry zone. The two children were both girls and had typical HFS on the right side. Of the eight adults, five were men and three were women. Six had typical and two had atypical HFS. Six had HFS on the left side, and two had HFS on the right. Vascular cross compression was found at the nerve root entry zone in all cases. The average follow-up period was 7.3 years (range, 1 1/2 to 11 years). All but one patient had complete relief of their HFS immediately or after delay. In one adult, the compressing artery could not be decompressed without damaging the nerves. One adult patient had two recurrences 1 year after the first operation and 6 months after the second; this patient had complete relief after a third operation. Complications included temporary mild facial weakness in four patients and moderate hearing impairment in the patient who had three operations. These results are comparable to those of HFS of adult onset. Microvascular decompression is recommended as the treatment of choice for HFS during childhood.\r"

  ".W": "Motor vehicle crashes account for approximately one-half of all hospitalized patients with brain injury. Therefore, measures to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries from motor vehicle crashes have the potential for making a substantial impact on the incidence and severity of brain trauma. Occupant restraints, including seat belts and air bags, have been proven highly effective in preventing injuries, yet the specific benefits for the brain, the face, and the cervical spine provided by air bags have not been widely publicized. Air bags prevent the violent whiplash motion of the head in a frontal crash, resulting in a more controlled deceleration of the brain. Wrenching forces exerted on the cervical spine are attenuated, and the face is protected from contact with hard or lacerating surfaces. Furthermore, compliance is not a problem with air bags. When a car is equipped with air bags, they are in effect 100% of the time, which is important for the protection of high risk groups, such a teenage boys, who tend to wear seat belts less often than other groups. It is estimated from national data and from epidemiological studies that air bags could have prevented or reduced brain injury for 25% of the hospitalized, brain-injured population. If provided as standard equipment on both the driver and the passenger side, air bags could do more to reduce the toll of brain trauma than any other available intervention. Air bags were ready for introduction into the marketplace 15 years ago. Since then, approximately 150,000 preventable deaths and more than 1,500,000 preventable brain injuries have occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis of drug concentrations in brain showed an additive pharmacodynamic interaction for phenytoin and carbamazepine, indicating that the combination is unlikely to be superior to either drug alone.

Initial clinical diagnosis identified 96% of cases who met the criterion when first tested and 100% of those with multiple deficits at follow-up. Specificity with respect to the criterion was 86% on initial testing and 89% at follow-up.

We compared the performance of three groups: parkinsonians age-matched controls, and mildly impaired patients with probable Alzheimer's disease in tests of general intellect, memory reaction time, and in a continuous performance task measuring attention and vigilance. Metabolites of the major biogenic amine in CSF were also measured. The parkinsonians formed two distinct groups. In one, intellectual function and CSF measures were similar to that of controls. The other group of parkinsonians had significantly more omission errors and fewer correct response on the continuous performance task than did controls or patients with Alzheimer's disease. We considered this second group to have bradyphrenia. Their performance on measures of general intellectual and memory function was similar to that of the patients with Alzheimer's disease. CSF-MHPG, the major metabolite of norepinephrine, correlated with the continuous performance task and reaction time in all parkinsonians, and those with bradyphrenia had the highest CSF-MHPG levels. Our data suggest that bradyphrenia is an impairment of attention and vigilance, unique to Parkinson's disease, that may be associated with dementia and with an alteration in norepinephrine metabolism.\r"

The cholinergic dysfunction of heart rate variation, therefore, could be due to a specific loss of dopaminergic neurons in the vagal motor nucleus.\r"

The reclining posture eliminated the alignment of the vertical axis of the body with the vertical axis of the environment. Patients made fewer reports to the body left, but also fewer reports to the environment left, independent of body position. This suggest that a cerebral hemisphere directs attention not only relative to the body midline axis, but also relative to an environmental reference frame.\r"

In controls and in one of the two patients, the isotope-exchange assay was also evaluated after disruption of mitochondria by sonication: in controls the activity almost doubled because of the contribution of inner CPT to the assay, but in the patients it did not increase, indicating absence of the CPT-II activity. After further disruption of mitochondria by freezing and all-glass homogenization, CPT activity in patients decreased to 36% and 10% of control. These data suggest CPT deficiency was limited to the inner mitochondrial activity. The alteration could be explained by mutation of the membrane factor that determines in situ differences between CPT-I and II.\r"

Peak concentrations of virus are reduced by 1,000-fold in serum and by 30-fold in muscle, but anti-RRV antibody production is not altered. Treatment with rIFN-alpha A/D dramatically reduces inflammation and necrosis in muscle. Beneficial effects of rIFN-alpha A/D on experimental, RRV-induced polymyositis result in part from inhibition of viral replication and spread, though immunomodulation might also play an important role.\r"

Compared with oral levodopa, LDME infusions resulted in marked reductions of both plasma levodopa variations and motor response fluctuations in patients with either wearing-off or on-off phenomena. During infusions lasting approximately 1 week, there were no complications except for peripheral vein phlebitis. The results suggest that LDME might be a practical parenteral treatment for those with severe Parkinson's disease.

  ".U": "87259245\r", 
  ".W": "Eighty-six fetuses of 21-41 weeks' gestation with arrhythmias were studied with ultrasound and heart rate monitoring. The type of arrhythmia was identified by M-mode studies and was confirmed by postnatal electrocardiogram in 70 infants. The most common arrhythmia was premature atrial contractions (76), followed by premature ventricular contractions (five), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (four), and atrial fibrillation/flutter (one). Doppler echocardiography was performed in 54 fetuses to measure flow velocities across the atrioventricular and semilunar valves. After isolated premature atrial and ventricular contractions, post-extrasystolic potentiation was demonstrated by an increase in fractional shortening (N = 32) of 49 +/- 6% in the right ventricle and 64 +/- 7% in the left ventricle. When post-extrasystolic beats were compared with normal beats, Doppler-determined time-velocity integrals increased 43% across the tricuspid valve, 41% across the mitral valve, 34% across the pulmonary valve, and 38% across the aortic valve. Mean velocity increased significantly after conversion to normal sinus rhythm in the five fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia (P less than .05). By studying the physiologic consequences of fetal arrhythmias using two-dimensional Doppler and M-mode ultrasound, we have documented the presence of post-extrasystolic potentiation after premature contractions, the existence of the Frank-Starling mechanism, and an increase in mean velocity (and therefore in cardiac output) after conversion of fetal tachyarrhythmias to normal sinus rhythm.\r"

We studied 124 twin pairs grouped at four degrees of discordancy: over 5, 10, 15, and 20% birth weight difference, using the larger twin as 100%. Twins with birth weight discrepancy below these figures were considered concordant. Highly discordant second twins showed significantly lower birth weight, gestational age, and Apgar scores, and prolonged neonatal hospitalization, as compared with discordant first twins. Complex presentations and a higher cesarean section rate characterize discordant first and concordant twins. It is suggested that a 15% birth weight discordancy be used as the safety limit for birth weight disparity. We also recommend special attention when discordancy seems to increase, especially if the discordant is the second twin.\r"

Infants with no intraventricular hemorrhage had a statistically significant incidence of higher mean mental scores (96.5 +/- 18.1 versus 90.1 +/- 18.3) and psychomotor scores (95.5 +/- 17.6 versus 86.7 +/- 16.8), and a lesser proportion of serious neurologic handicaps (7 versus 11.5%), than those with minor hemorrhages (grade I or II), although no difference was noted between infants who had experienced grade I versus grade II hemorrhages. Similarly, the outcomes of those infants with severe intraventricular hemorrhage were significantly worse than those with minor hemorrhages, with the worst outcomes in those with grade IV. Evaluation of 94 infants at three years of age indicates that the mental and neurologic assessments performed at one year of age were accurate predictors of later status.\r"

All values are reported as mean +/- standard deviation (SD). Primiparas with peridural anesthesia showed significantly less decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (1.7 +/- 1.4%; P less than .001; N = 15), superior scores on the visual pain analog scale (3.5 +/- 2.0), and a significantly better neonatal acid-base status (pH 7.29 +/- 0.06; P = .01; base excess -6.4 +/- 2.2; P less than .05) as compared with primiparas treated with meperidine and nitrous oxide (SaO2 7.2 +/- 3.9%; visual pain analog scale 7.1 +/- 1.2; pH 7.21 +/- 0.1; base excess -9.5 +/- 4.5; N = 16).

Which victim was injured strongly correlated with her age and race, the race of her assailant, and whether he had a weapon. White victims sustained both genital and nongenital injury almost twice as often as black victims. Whether she knew her assailant was less important, unless the victim was a child. Survivors attacked by a single assailant were injured as often as survivors of a \"gang rape.\" Conclusions drawn from these data must take into account that these victims choose to report the event to the authorities, and self-reporting bias might explain some of the findings. Approximately half the victims seen sustained no injury. Apparently, physical injury is not a inevitable consequence of being raped.\r"

The response to this treatment was evaluated by colposcopy and cytology three and six months after initiation of therapy. Seventeen patients (85%) showed no evidence of the disease when examined three months after treatment. Three women, although improved, had persistent vaginal condylomata, which responded to a second course of 5-fluorouracil given twice each week. After a follow-up of ten to 20 months (mean 15.8 months), 16 patients remained free of disease, two developed recurrence, and two were lost to follow-up. Two women developed mild vulvar irritation and eight had vaginal discharge.

No colposcopic evidence of human papillomavirus was found in 18 patients at the first visit, whereas 28 patients required reapplication of trichloroacetic acid. Three months after treatment, a follow-up Papanicolaou smear and colposcopic examination revealed no human papillomavirus infection in 31 patients.

A common finding in all five women was the detection of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of human papillomavirus types 6 or 16 in their lesions, using high-stringency in situ hybridization. The role of human papillomavirus and herpes simplex virus in the etiology of intraepithelial neoplasia is discussed. Close follow-up is recommended for DES-exposed patients, especially those who have risk factors known to be associated with genital neoplasia.\r"

They also have a high incidence of spontaneous abortion, possibly related to major lethal malformations. We tested the hypothesis that adverse fetal outcome (fetal loss before 20 weeks' gestation and/or congenital major malformations) is related to magnesium status (as assessed by determining serum magnesium levels) in insulin-dependent diabetic pregnant women, even after sonographic documentation of fetal viability. Eighty-four insulin-dependent diabetic women (class B to RT) with 96 pregnancies were recruited prospectively in a program project. Serum magnesium and blood glycohemoglobin were measured at about nine weeks' gestation. Blood glycohemoglobin was higher (P = .039) and serum magnesium concentration lower (P = .05) in the 21 pregnancies that ended in adverse fetal outcome, compared with the other (75) successful pregnancies. When compared with the \"successful pregnancy\" group, blood glycohemoglobin was higher (P = .012) and serum magnesium lower (P = .037) in the subgroup of nine pregnancies with fetal cardiac activity present by ten weeks and ending in adverse fetal outcome, compared with the 64 equivalent pregnancies in the \"successful\" group. We speculate that decreased magnesium status may contribute to the high spontaneous abortion and malformation rate in insulin-dependent diabetic pregnant women.\r"

The prevalence of diabetes in patients with risk factors was significantly greater than among those with no risk factors (P less than .001). Of 936 patients who had no risk factors, four were found to have diabetes. Multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that family history, obesity, and age over 25 years contributed significantly to the prediction of gestational diabetes. More than 10% of gestational diabetics had screening values between 135-139 mg/dL. Among patients whose early screening values were elevated and whose initial glucose tolerance tests were normal, the odds of being classified ultimately as a gestational diabetic were 7.3 times that of patients whose initial screening tests were normal. Selective screening based on risk factors including maternal age may enhance detection of diabetes early in gestation.\r"

In order to determine whether a selective inhibition of SAP-35 occurs in well controlled, insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancies, we compared SAP-35 concentration and lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratios in amniotic fluid from 30 well controlled, insulin-dependent women with 30 nondiabetic pregnant women pair-matched for gestational age, race, and indication for amniocentesis. Gestational ages ranged from 30-43 weeks, with a mean of 36.5 +/- 2.5 weeks, in both groups. Surfactant associated protein-35 was measured by an enzyme-linked capture immunoassay specific for SAP-35 and its oligomers. Mean +/- SEM SAP-35 was 3.7 +/- 0.4 micrograms/mL (N = 30) in the diabetic group, not significantly different from 5.0 +/- 1.1 micrograms/mL (N = 30) in the control group (P greater than .05). Mean L/S ratios were also not different: 2.4 +/- 0.1 (diabetic) compared with 2.3 +/- 0.1 (control); P greater than .05. The rate of RDS was similar in both groups. We conclude that in well controlled diabetic pregnancies, fetal lung maturation, as assessed by the L/S ratio, SAP-35 concentration, and outcome, is not adversely affected.\r"

To study one aspect of this issue, that of peripheral dopamine metabolism in polycystic ovary syndrome, we measured the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine after intravenous dopamine infusions in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and in matched controls. In addition, we measured urinary metabolites of dopamine and norepinephrine, which reflect in part central catecholamine turnover, after daily ingestion of L-dopa with carbidopa, which increases brain dopamine levels. After dopamine infusion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and in matched controls, steady state levels of plasma dopamine, norepinephrine, and the ratio of dopamine/norepinephrine were similar in the two groups. Similarly, urinary metabolites of dopamine, norepinephrine, and their ratios were not different in patients and controls after L-dopa with carbidopa. We suggest that no major alterations in dopamine metabolism exist in these patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.\r"

In this study, the serum levels of follicle regulatory protein were measured in five groups of women: reproductive age undergoing oophorectomy (N = 10), postmenopausal (N = 10), ovulatory (N = 13), anovulatory (N = 16), and anovulatory receiving clomiphene citrate therapy (N = 14). Follicle regulatory protein-related immunoreactivity was measured by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while peripheral estradiol and progesterone levels were determined by established radioimmunoassay. Concentration of follicle regulatory protein in serum in all ovariectomized patients decreased significantly from preoperative levels. The postmenopausal women had significantly lower follicle regulatory protein levels than did ovulatory and anovulatory women. Patients with low levels of serum estradiol in the early follicular phase exhibited either significantly elevated or suppressed follicle regulatory protein levels compared with patients with normal estradiol concentrations, suggesting two different etiologies for ovarian dysfunction. Eleven to 12 and 22-23 days after the onset of the last menstrual period, patients with elevated follicle regulatory protein levels were found to be anovulatory. These observations suggest that elevated intraovarian levels of follicle regulatory protein may cause a disruption of follicular maturation that leads to anovulation and, in some cases, to resistance to clomiphene citrate therapy.\r"

Immunoglobulins and complement fractions appeared in statistically lower concentrations in follicular fluid than in serum. This gradient was clearly larger for immunoglobulin M (IgM) than for IgG, IgA, C3, or C4. Ten patients who were autoantibody positive to one or more of the evaluated antigens demonstrated statistically higher total IgG and IgM levels and lower C3 and C4 than 16 autoantibody negative patients. With regard to follicular fluid, positive patients had significantly elevated IgM levels in comparison with negative control patients, and significantly decreased C3 and C4 concentrations. Patients who were autoantibody positive in serum also exhibited uniformly abnormal follicular fluid autoantibodies. Positive patients had significantly higher IgG antiphospholipid antibodies in follicular fluid than controls, and demonstrated a similar trend for IgM and IgA antiphospholipid antibodies. Positive patients demonstrated no significant differences from negative patients in number of in vitro fertilization attempts, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, and number of abnormal (granular) oocytes. However, positive patients experienced a lower pregnancy rate (5.4%) than negative patients (26.1%), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .07). This observation strongly suggests that the presence of abnormal autoantibodies in the female may reduce the chance of pregnancy for in vitro fertilization patients. A similar effect of abnormal autoantibodies can then also be expected in attempts at spontaneous conception.\r"

In corpus luteum and testis homogenates, the relative binding affinity of AHF-hCG was two- to fourfold higher in the ovary and five- to tenfold higher in the testis than that of native hCG. When assayed for luteinizing hormone (LH)-like activity in granulosa-luteal cells from in vitro fertilization patients and in testicular minces from patients undergoing orchiectomy for prostatic cancer, AHF-hCG did not stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. When added with hCG to granulosa-luteal cells or to testicular minces, AHF-hCG inhibited hCG-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. These results indicate that the enhanced affinity to LH receptor caused by removal of the sugar moieties from hCG is associated with total inability to activate granulosa-luteal and Leydig cell adenylate cyclase, and that AHF-hCG is, in the human gonad, an hCG antagonist.\r"

The overall frequency of inflammation in 123 placentas was 85.45%. There were good interrelationships between inflammatory lesions at various sites. Membrane infiltrates of 3+ were seen in 90.9% of intra-amniotic infection cases, but in only 18.4% of asymptomatic patients (P less than .001). Conversely, 76.9% of patients with 3+ inflammation had intra-amniotic infection, whereas only 7% with lesser degrees of inflammation had intra-amniotic infection. Inflammation of any degree (1-3+) had a low specificity (28%) for febrile maternal outcome. Bacteria were recovered in 117 (95.1%) of the amniotic fluids. The grade of histologic lesions was associated with total colony count of bacteria in amniotic fluid (P less than .05) and with high-virulence bacteria in amniotic fluid (P less than .05), and Mycoplasma hominis in amniotic fluid (P less than .05). Bacteria were found in 67.6% and mycoplasmas in 18.6% of amniotic membrane cultures. Chlamydia trachomatis was not recovered in any of 35 amniotic membrane cultures. No significant correlation was seen between organisms in the amniotic membrane and histologic inflammation. Thus, positive amniotic fluid culture results are associated with histologic inflammation, and may cause the inflammatory response. A logistic regression model revealed that predictors of histologic inflammation include maternal diagnosis, amniotic fluid colony count, and M hominis in amniotic fluid.\r"

A multidisciplinary team examined 43 surviving infants at corrected one year of life and measured their mental and psychomotor development by the Bayley scales.

Umbilical arterial acidemia occurred in 40% of the neonates with moderate to severe bradycardia (25 of 63), in 30% with mild bradycardia (16 of 53), and in 22% with tachycardia (seven of 32), compared with only 6% (eight of 129) of those with a normal FHR (P less than .05 in each of the three comparisons). The majority (31 of 56, 55%) of the acidemic neonates had a mixed respiratory-metabolic pattern, whereas 13 of 56 (23%) had a respiratory pattern and 12 of 56 (21%) had a metabolic pattern. The mean umbilical arterial buffer deficit (mEq/L) was significantly greater (P less than .0005) in newborns with metabolic acidemia (-15.9 +/- 2.8) than in those with either mixed (-9.6 +/- 2.5) or respiratory (-6.4 +/- 1.9) acidemia. We conclude that baseline second-stage FHR abnormalities can predict which newborns are at increased risk of having umbilical arterial pH below 7.2 at birth. Selective determination of umbilical arterial pH and blood gas analysis may be useful in assessing intrapartum management retrospectively.\r"

The first manifestations of fetal acidosis are nonreactive nonstress testing and loss of fetal breathing; in advanced acidemia, fetal movements and fetal tone are compromised. A protocol of antepartum fetal evaluation is suggested based upon the individual biophysical components rather than the score alone.\r"

Diagnostic urodynamic evaluation in symptomatic women included standard history, physical examination, urine culture, Q-tip test, uroflowmetry, standing \"stress test,\" resting and stress urethral pressure profiles, and subtracted medium-fill water cystometry with provocation. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the existence of significant clinical predictors of the dependent variables (stress angle, urethral mobility). These factors were used as covariates to identify differences between the adjusted group means. The results indicate a wide range of values for each Q-tip test measurement in all groups. Age, parity, resting Q-tip angle, and the presence of anterior vaginal relaxation were associated with maximum stress Q-tip measurement. Significant differences in maximum stress Q-tip angle and urethral mobility were noted only between the continent controls and women with genuine stress incontinence. No differences were found between the two incontinent study groups. We conclude that urethral position and mobility as measured by the Q-tip test are related to defects in anterior vaginal support, but not to specific urologic diagnosis.\r"

Twenty vitamin K1 and 33 control infants qualified for the study. Infants in both groups received routine postnatal vitamin K1. On admission, the infant's prothrombin activity and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were measured. A head ultrasound was done between days 2 and 4 of life. Results demonstrated significantly improved prothrombin activity, a nonsignificant trend toward improved PTT, and a significantly decreased frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage in infants whose mothers had received vitamin K1.

Such a policy resulted in a significant decline in third- and fourth-degree lacerations in nulliparous women. This reduction was most pronounced in nulliparous women delivering infants larger than 3400 g. No third- or fourth-degree laceration occurred without antecedent episiotomy in any woman. A policy of using episiotomy selectively appears to lower the incidence of perineal trauma.\r"

We studied 565 matched pairs (case/control) of rural teenage primigravidas with single pregnancies with and without the social support of the Resource Mother. There were significantly more patients with adequate prenatal care in the program group (P less than .000001).

Zonular breaks occurred more commonly with pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PX) (P less than 0.0001), with decreasing pupil size (P less than 0.0001), and with one surgeon who used the Simcoe aspirating needle (Storz) exclusively (P = 0.0001). It is acknowledged that it is very difficult to standardize what constitutes a small zonular break; hence, the increase in zonular breaks recorded by this surgeon may have been due only to his using less stringent criteria than the others. Capsule breaks had no significant risk factors at the 0.01 level. High myopia, advanced cataract, glaucoma, advanced age, and diabetes mellitus were not found to be risk factors for vitreous loss, zonular breaks, or capsular breaks.\r"

  ".W": "The authors reviewed 3065 consecutive cases of extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implant (ECCE-PC IOL) and found the incidence of retinal detachment to be 1.4% overall (44/3065) and 1.7% in a group of eyes followed for at least 1 year (40/2330). Retrospective analysis of the retinal detachment (RD) group (n = 44) showed the patients to be significantly younger than the overall group (n = 3065) (P less than 0.0001). Comparison with an age-matched group of 302 eyes without RD showed higher rates of RD in males (P = 0.0013) and in eyes with axial eye length (AEL) greater than 25 mm (P less than 0.0001). No significant correlation was found between RD and PC IOL manufacturer, phacoemulsification (PKE), or primary discission. Sixty-four percent of RDs occurred within 1 year of cataract operation. Only 10% occurred more than 2 years later. Visual results in eyes with ultimate anatomic success of RD repair (43 of 44 eyes, averaging 15 months follow-up) are substantially better than previously reported in series with other types of IOLs (96% greater than or equal to 20/40 if the macula was not involved, 75% greater than or equal to 20/40 if the macula was involved).\r"

Pretreatment and posttreatment evaluations included rose Bengal and fluorescein staining, Schirmer testing, and conjunctival impression cytology. Six weeks after plug placement, 11 of 18 patients had subjective improvement and were able to decrease dependency on tear supplements; all of these patients have successfully worn plugs for at least 8 months. Although these 11 patients improved clinically, impression cytologic abnormalities persisted 6 weeks after plug placement. Three patients did not improve clinically after punctal plug therapy, and four patients improved subjectively but extruded plugs within 2 weeks of placement. Three of the patients who extruded plugs had marked lid laxity and dilated puncta before placement. Reversible punctal occlusion by plugs may significantly decrease dependency on tear supplements in selected patients.\r"

An out-patient regimen of intramuscular antibiotics (either penicillin, cephalosporin, or spectinomycin [Trobicin]) appeared to be effective for infections limited to the conjunctiva in adults.

  ".W": "A retrospective study was performed to determine the long-term course of pseudoexfoliation (PEX) as it relates to both the development of elevated intraocular pressure and to the initial appearance of exfoliation material in normal fellow eyes of patients with PEX. Six hundred eighty patients seen from 1940 through 1980 were diagnosed as having PEX. Patients were excluded from long-term study if there was a diagnosis of glaucoma prior to examination at our institution (199 patients), if glaucoma was present at the time of diagnosis of PEX (40 patients), if there was a history of prior intraocular surgery or disease (19 patients), or if there was only one ocular examination performed (75 patients). The remaining 347 patients with initially normal intraocular pressures were followed over time and consisted of 225 patients with unilateral PEX and 122 patients with bilateral PEX (a total of 469 PEX eyes). Life table (actuarial) analysis was used for data evaluation. During the course of the study, 32 (14%) of the unilateral cases of PEX became bilateral. The cumulative probability of a normal fellow eye developing PEX increased over time, with a 6.8% cumulative probability in 5 years and a 16.8% cumulative probability in 10 years. Elevated intraocular pressure developed in 35 patients (44 eyes) during the study. The cumulative probability for eyes with PEX to develop elevated intraocular pressure was 5.3% in 5 years and increased to 15.4% in 10 years. These probabilities predict that patients with PEX have a higher incidence of developing elevated intraocular pressure than would be expected in patients without PEX of similar age.\r"

All patients had two automated visual fields immediately before laser treatment. They also had follow-up automated perimetry at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months posttreatment. The serial visual fields were compared using a one-way analysis of variance and trend analysis. After the laser trabeculoplasty, six patients showed visual field improvement, eight showed no change, and five showed progressive visual field deterioration. Patients with little fluctuation of IOP measurements after laser treatment had a better prognosis for visual field retention. The mean IOP level, however, was a poor predictor of visual field progression. Patients with more extensive visual field damage before laser treatment did not do worse than patients with less extensive visual field loss.\r"

By adjusting the frequency of postoperative 5-FU subconjunctival injections according to the clinical response, the author thought it might be possible to reduce episcleral fibroproliferation and maintain a patent filter while reducing complications. Sixty-three eyes underwent filtering surgery with subsequent subconjunctival injections of 5.0 to 7.5 mg 5-FU for 14 days. The antimetabolite was not administered if there was evidence of corneal toxicity as demonstrated by epithelial defects or filaments, flat anterior chamber, or a conjunctival wound leak. By adjusting the injections in this fashion, the total amount of 5-FU administered ranged between 17.5 and 62.5 mg (34.4 +/- 11.6 mg). After 1 year, successful surgical outcomes were observed in 13/15 eyes with aphakia (87%), 11/17 eyes with neovascular glaucoma (65%), 11/12 eyes with at least two previous failed filters (92%), and 5/6 eyes with inflammatory glaucoma (83%). Eyes with epithelial downgrowth and cicatrizing diseases of the conjunctiva also were treated. Overall, conjunctival wound leaks were observed in 24% of the eyes and 29% had detectable changes in their corneal epithelium with corneal defects and filaments. Although adjusting the dose of 5-FU appears to be safe and effective, this can be determined clearly only by a controlled randomized clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred twenty neonates with suspected early onset sepsis were prospectively studied to evaluate the ability of a sepsis screen to discriminate infected from noninfected newborn infants. A positive sepsis screen consisted of positive findings in two or more of the following tests: total white blood cell count; immature/total neutrophil ratio; C-reactive protein; micro-erythrocyte sedimentation rate; or plasma fibronectin. For proved sepsis a four-part screen excluding fibronectin yielded a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 83%, positive predictive value of 27% and negative predictive value of 100%. In contrast the sensitivity of white blood cell count and immature/total neutrophil ratio was only 46%. Adding fibronectin to the four-part screen provided equal sensitivity and negative predictive value but decreased specificity and positive predictive value. While plasma fibronectin may play an important role in the pathogenesis of neonatal sepsis, it is not useful as a marker for infection. The screens did not identify preterm infants with late onset nosocomial sepsis. Although clinical judgment should be the primary factor in the decision to institute antibiotic therapy, a simple four-part sepsis screen provides valuable presumptive information for excluding the diagnosis of early onset neonatal sepsis.\r"

The majority of these children originate from areas of the world where the hepatitis B virus is hyperendemic and where the prevalence of numerous other infectious diseases is higher than it is domestically. We consecutively screened 360 adopted Korean children for hepatitis B virus markers, syphilis serology, tuberculin status and the presence of parasitic infection. Ten hepatitis B virus carriers were identified (prevalence, 2.8%) as were two children with congenital syphilis and two with reactive tuberculin skin tests. Intestinal parasitosis was not evident but four cases of scabies were detected and were associated with prior residence in an orphanage. We conclude that even though the seroprevalence rate was lower than expected, providers responsible for the care of Korean adoptees should screen for the hepatitis B surface antigen carrier state, that susceptible household contacts of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive children should be protected with hepatitis B vaccine and that children treated abroad for congenital syphilis should be assessed for the adequacy of therapy.\r"

Twenty-five tuberculin-positive children who developed measles (13 uncomplicated and 12 complicated) were skin-tested weekly beginning 1 to 2 weeks before and ending 2 to 7 weeks after the onset of the rash. All children became anergic during the acute phase of measles. Children with complications remained unreactive for a significantly longer period of time after the rash (mean, 4 weeks) than did children without complications (mean, 2.3 weeks, P less than 0.001).\r"

Univariate and multivariate analyses of the data were carried out. Values for hemoglobin and platelet count were similar in Group A and Group B patients even though these measurements in both groups differed from base line steady state values. Absolute band counts were usually greater in Group A patients, but the sensitivity and specificity of elevated band counts as a diagnostic tool for bacterial infection were relatively low. We conclude that no aspect of the complete blood count can be used to guide major management decisions in febrile children with sickle cell anemia and potentially life-threatening infection.\r"

  ".W": "In an open randomized study 17 patients with a positive culture for Bordetella pertussis were treated for 10 days with erythromycin (50 mg/kg/day divided in 2 doses). The bacterium could not be isolated during therapy and in only one patient was it isolated 5 days after cessation of treatment. In comparison B. pertussis was isolated 10 and 15 days after diagnosis from 10 and 4 patients, respectively, of a group of 21 untreated controls. The treated group developed significantly fewer whoops than did the control group, even though most of the individuals had reached the paroxysmal stage at diagnosis. The dose of erythromycin (ethylsuccinate and stearate preparations) gave serum concentrations about 100 times larger than the minimal inhibitory concentration of isolated bacteria and was well-tolerated. Thus adequate erythromycin treatment eliminates B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and reduces symptoms in patients having a history of pertussis of less than 14 days. Adequate dosage and length of treatment might be crucial for these results.\r"

Aminoglycoside use totaled 16,279 patient days of which 16,070 (98.7%) were with amikacin. From November 1, 1980, to January 31, 1983, 1017 pairs of pre- and posttreatment endotracheal or pharyngeal specimens yielded 318 Gram-negative bacteria isolates. From November 1, 1980, to December 31, 1985, Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 381 clinical specimens. Of the 318 surveillance and 380 clinical isolates tested, 285 (90%) and 358 (94%), respectively, were susceptible to amikacin. Amikacin resistance did not increase during the study. Amikacin-resistant organisms were isolated more frequently from patients receiving multiple courses than those receiving single courses of amikacin and resistant organisms were not usually found before the administration of amikacin. None of the 15 amikacin-resistant isolates made 6'-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase and 3 isolates took up only small amounts of radiolabeled amikacin, suggesting that resistance was due to decreased permeability. The extensive use of amikacin in a neonatal intensive care unit for over 5 years did not result in an increase of amikacin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.\r"

In each category, the departments were asked whether the procedures were mandatory or optional. Birth certificates are uniformly required within the health codes of all states. Although in-hospital identification of newborns is required in most states, four states specifically require arm banding, and only New York State requires footprinting. Eye prophylaxis with silver nitrate is required in 49 states, with erythromycin or tetracycline allowed as topical alternatives in 42 states. Clamping of the umbilical cord is addressed by eight states. Parenteral vitamin K administration is mandated by only five states. Apgar scoring is addressed by 25 states. Newborn metabolic screening is available in every health department, although significant variations exist in the tests available.\r"

The hypothesis was tested by examining the vasculature of fetuses with spinal neural tube defects. In each case, the arterial supply to the region of the neural tube defect was disturbed. Because development of arterial supply to the neural folds predates neural tube closure, these vascular abnormalities are considered to be primary malformations that lead to neural tube defects rather than secondary morphologic disturbances resulting from neural tube defects.\r"

During the 5-year period, 1980 to 1984, 32 children less than 14 years of age were admitted to our medical center with contact burns of the hand. Patients were divided into two groups: those with major burns requiring greater than or equal to seven days of hospitalization (n = 16) and those with minor burns requiring less than seven days of hospitalization (n = 16). Compared with patients in the minor burn group, patients in the major burn group were hospitalized longer (16.9 v 2.8 days), were more likely to require surgical excision and grafting (63% v 0%), and had more extensive follow-up (5.3 v 2.5 visits). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to percentage of area burned, age, sex, primary admission v referral, and cause of burn. These data support the recommendation that all such burns be managed initially on an inpatient basis.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that passive smoking (involuntary inhalation of tobacco smoke by nonsmokers) reduces small airways function. We evaluated the exposure to passive smoking and its effects on pulmonary function and symptoms in a group of 12- to 17-year-old high school athletes (N = 209; 119 boys and 90 girls) at their annual presport participation physical examinations. A structured interview was used to assess pulmonary symptoms, personal smoking habits, and passive cigarette smoke exposure. All athletes performed forced expiratory maneuvers on a portable spirometer. We measured forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced expiratory flow 25% to 75% (FEF25-75). The best of three FEF25-75 measured was used. Less than 70% of predicted FEF25-75 was considered abnormal. Of the 209 athletes, 7.7% were active smokers and were excluded. Of the remaining 193 athletes, 68.4% were currently exposed to passive smoking. We found a fourfold increase in incidence of low FEF25-75 and/or cough in athletes exposed to passive smoking compared with athletes not exposed: 18 of 132 exposed athletes (13.6%) had low FEF25-75 and/or cough compared with two of 61 unexposed athletes (3.3%) who had low FEF25-75 and cough (P = .02). Boys were more frequently exposed to passive smoking than girls (74% of boys [80/108] v 61% of girls [52/85] ), but the effects were more pronounced in girls. These data show a relationship between exposure to passive smoking and early pulmonary dysfunction in young athletes. The frequent exposure to passive smoke and the high prevalence of dysfunction in this population, generally considered to be healthy, is of particular concern.\r"

The highest annual incidence was in children less than 3 years of age (3.02 per 100,000 children) and was equal in black and white children. No demographic risk factors were associated with the incidence of this disease including population density, median family income, crowding in housing units, percentage of households with public water supply, and percentage of households with public sewers. Our data suggest that this disease is common, endemic, and increasing in incidence in King County, Washington.\r"

In 1973, a survey was done of the ages of 243 living patients with thalassemia major followed at 12 centers in the United States and Canada. Twenty-two percent were younger than 5 years and 2.1% were older than 25 years of age (mean 11.4 +/- 6.7 [SD] years). In 1985, there were 303 patients at the same centers; 11% were younger than 5 years and 7.9% were older than 25 years (mean 14.2 +/- 7.3 years). A similar pattern was found in Connecticut, characterized by a marked decrease of new cases of thalassemia major during the past 15 years. This was not a result of fewer persons at genetic risk or a change in marital ethnic choices. Eleven of 14 families who had a child with thalassemia major assured that another affected child would not be born by having no more children, using prenatal diagnosis, or having therapeutic abortions. Extensive community programs of education and testing for thalassemia trait in Connecticut may also have contributed to the observed reduction in new cases.\r"

Viral infection was associated with 42% of the cases, beta-hemolytic streptococci with 31% (12% group A), Mycoplasma pneumoniae with 5%, and unknown cause with 35%. More than one agent was implicated in 14% of the cases. Adenovirus was the viral agent most frequently (19%) recorded. Other viruses involved were Epstein-Barr virus, parainfluenza, influenza A, herpes simplex, and respiratory syncytial viruses. The responsible agent was found by rapid viral antigen detection in 20% of all cases and by rapid test for group A streptococcal antigen detection in 10%. Age was the most important factor in predicting the causative agent. Viral tonsillitis was most common in children younger than 3 years of age and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci tonsillitis in children 6 years of age or more. Clinical analysis of the illness, WBC count, and ESR did not reveal differences that could help in differentiating bacterial from viral tonsillitis. All patients were treated with a regimen of oral penicillin. Fever associated with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci tonsillitis responded to penicillin therapy significantly more rapidly than fever associated with viral infections. These observations demonstrate the prominent role of viruses in the etiology of febrile exudative tonsillitis, especially in young children, and reinforce the benefit of rapid tests before antibiotic therapy is started.\r"

Heart rate and breathing pattern were recorded in 30 preterm infants (gestational age 30.0 +/- 2.3 weeks, postnatal age 46.6 +/- 20.8 days, and weight 1,438 +/- 266 g) before and after a transfusion of 10 mL/kg of packed RBCs. All infants were stable clinically, breathing room air, and free of prolonged apneic episodes. After transfusion, hematocrit levels increased from 27.0% +/- 2.5% to 35.8% +/- 4.7%. Heart rate decreased from 157.2 +/- 13.6 beats per minute to 148.4 +/- 13.9 beats per minute. There was no change in respiratory rate or BP. The duration of periodic breathing decreased significantly, as did the duration of the longest periodic breathing episode (P less than .01). The number of respiratory pauses lasting 5 to 10 seconds and the number of pauses lasting 11 to 20 seconds also decreased significantly (P less than .05). The total duration of respiratory pauses, excluding pauses during periodic breathing, were significantly lower after transfusion (P less than .05), as was the number of episodes of bradycardia. These results indicate that preterm infants have a more irregular breathing pattern while anemic than after correction of the anemia. The irregular breathing pattern is probably caused by mild hypoxic respiratory center depression.\r"

Careful evaluation of hypercholesterolemia is necessary. Persons with a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol need diet therapy, because they are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Weight reduction and fat restriction can lower blood pressure, help control hyperglycemia, and improve the LDL cholesterol-HDL cholesterol ratio. Some evidence indicates a protective role of beta carotene against cancer in animals. However, hypervitaminosis A is dangerous and relatively easy to accomplish, so supplementation beyond a multivitamin tablet is discouraged. Data about inhibition of cancer in humans through use of high doses of vitamin E or C or selenium are inconclusive, and studies of effects of long-term ingestion are not available. In general, megadoses of even healthy substances are thought to be dangerous. Decreased consumption of fat, increased consumption of foods high in fiber, and elimination of alcohol and tobacco are sensible recommendations. Consumption of cruciferous vegetables has not been proven to reduce the incidence of cancer, but a moderate amount of them in the diet would seem reasonable.\r"

Various treatments have been tried, with varied success. Recently, fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase (Abbokinase) or urokinase (Kabikinase, Streptase) has gained popularity as a treatment option. In the case presented here, complete lysis of effort-induced subclavian-axillary vein thrombosis was achieved with the use of catheter-directed infusion of streptokinase. Subsequently, a pulmonary embolus developed, causing marked morbidity. It is likely that fibrinolytic therapy was directly responsible for this complication. The current literature does not support routine use of fibrinolytic agents in the treatment of effort-induced thrombi of the upper extremity, since these agents can cause significant morbidity. We conclude that fibrinolytic therapy should be reserved for life-threatening conditions, such as myocardial infarction, massive pulmonary emboli, and significant arterial occlusions.\r"

Many of the effects of heat and chemical burns to the airways are delayed and may not be clinically evident at first. Chest films are often not helpful, and direct laryngoscopic or bronchofibroscopic examination or a ventilation-perfusion scan may be necessary to verify the diagnosis. Treatment depends on the components involved, with chemically induced airway injury being the most complex to manage. Death rates remain high when inhalation injury is combined with severe body burns.\r"

A venogram revealed normal circulation in the right lower leg, and an ultrasound examination of the right popliteal fossa revealed a 2 X 5-cm popliteal cyst. Fluid aspirated from the cyst confirmed the diagnosis of gout. Popliteal cysts associated with gout are rare, and those that rupture, leak, dissect, or enlarge can mimic thrombophlebitis (a phenomenon known as pseudothrombophlebitis). Thus, the primary care physician should consider the diagnosis of popliteal cyst in patients who appear to have deep vein thrombophlebitis.\r"

However, the technology that permits the measurement of drug levels has often outpaced the clinical data base that allows proper interpretation of the level. Thus, the physician should be aware of both the potential and the limitations of therapeutic drug monitoring and apply the technique critically with respect to individual drugs in individual patients.\r"

Retrograde amnesia prevents recall of events antedating the episode by hours to years, and anterograde amnesia produces the characteristic features of inability to learn new material and repetitious questioning. Laboratory investigation of these patients is generally unrewarding. Transient global amnesia is easily distinguished from amnesia caused by head trauma or transient ischemic attack, confusional state, and functional amnesia. Although transient global amnesia is most likely caused by transient ischemia of brain structures important for memory, thromboembolic cerebrovascular disease is not the cause. The patient with transient global amnesia should be treated conservatively.\r"

Three movements were compared: static visual fixations, saccadic eye movements, and smooth pursuit eye movements. The subjects in this study were 35 healthy female volunteers. Balance was defined as the subjects' ability to maintain their equilibrium while keeping the unstable platform on which they stood within 5 degrees of the horizontal plane. The testing protocol consisted of five recorded practice trials, during which the subjects tried to maintain their balance without any visual instructions, and nine experimental trials, during which they tried to maintain their balance while visually following a videotaped target light projected onto a screen. The target light was sequenced randomly to remain stationary, move in a continuous horizontal path, or alternately jump between right and left. Data were analyzed using a one-way multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures. A significant effect of vision on balance was found. The t tests for correlated samples revealed that time in balance during visual fixations and saccades was significantly longer than during tracking eye movements. We, therefore, concluded that tracking eye movements have a negative effect on balance. This information can be useful in treating patients with balance problems. For example, instructing patients to fixate visually on an object may aid their stability. Visual tracking of a moving limb, however, may impair a patient's stability.\r"

This longitudinal study evaluated, through direct observation and parent-guardian assessment, the behavioral changes seen with the use of ASDs and programming. Nineteen individuals with multiple handicaps and developmental disabilities, aged 1 to 6 years, participated as subjects. Data were collected by a trained observer from eight on-site evaluations and from parent-guardian responses to a preequipment and postequipment questionnaire. Evaluations were made every six weeks, starting about three months before and ending about six months after receiving the seating devices. The activities observed were head control, controlled sitting posture, visual tracking, reach, and grasp. Rating scale data were analyzed using an analysis of variance and a Friedman's test. Other data were analyzed descriptively for frequencies and central tendencies. Sitting posture, head control, and grasp improved significantly. Parent perceptions of the equipment indicated that the chairs freed parents from the need to provide support for their children's activities of daily living, which enabled them to participate in other activities with the children and around the home.\r"

We reviewed the records of the first 50 stroke patients with hemiparesis who met the entry criteria for the study and who were admitted over a four-month period of time. Static muscle strength was measured by hand-held dynamometry. Spasticity was graded on the Ashworth scale. Kendall's tau correlations were calculated between static muscle strength deficits and spasticity. Static strength deficits of the shoulder medial rotator and elbow flexor muscles were correlated (p less than .01) with the agonist muscles' spasticity, but not with the antagonist muscles' spasticity. Muscle group spasticity and strength deficits, therefore, appear to be covarying manifestations of cerebrovascular accidents. Clinicians, thus, may interpret an agonist muscle's capacity for force production in light of its own tone rather than that of its antagonist.\r"

The purposes of this study were to provide data on the incidence and degree of diastasis recti abdominis, to describe the measurement system used, and to determine the interrater reliability of the measurements performed. Forty subjects less than four days postpartum were tested by four raters. All subjects were measured in a supine, flexed-knee position at a standard point of palpation above the umbilicus. During palpation, each subject performed a partial sit-up, and the rater determined the number of finger widths filling the separation. An analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed a highly significant difference between the measurement scores of the four raters. This measurement system, therefore, was found to be unreliable. All subjects had some degree of diastasis recti abdominis; over 60% had separations significant enough to warrant protective exercises. The author proposes that the incidence and degree of diastasis recti abdominis may be underestimated, that selected components of exercise prescriptions may be contraindicated, and that a reliable instrument for measuring the degree of separation is needed.\r"

Ten female volunteers participated in the study, and each of the three cold modalities was applied randomly to the skin overlying the right triceps surae muscle. After 15 minutes of cold application, mean skin temperatures recorded under WI, DI, and CGP decreased 12 degrees, 9.9 degrees, and 7.3 degrees C, respectively. The only significant differences in cooling were between WI and DI and between WI and CGP. Fifteen minutes after removal of the cold modalities, no significant differences were found in mean skin temperature between WI, DI, and CGP. The residual mean decrease in skin temperature between the pretreatment rest interval (time 0) and 15 minutes after removal of the cold modality (time 30) was significant for WI only. No cooling was demonstrated 1 cm proximal or distal to any of the cooling agents after 15 minutes of cold application. These findings provide valuable information for the use of cryotherapy in the clinical setting.\r"

No significant differences were found in IPE SBP. The 60-rpm speed elicited significantly lower HR and RPP responses than the 30- or 90-rpm speeds. The 90-rpm speed elicited significantly lower HR responses than the 30-rpm speed.

This study provided evidence that training of a subject in a sitting position produced a nonspecific influence during ambulation. The inability to obtain an exact transfer of learning from a sitting position to gait and its implication to the specificity principle of learning are discussed. Some subjects had difficulty maintaining their performance over the three-day period. This finding was attributed in part to the influence of proactive and retroactive inhibition. Mat activities, therefore, seem to have a very limited impact on modifying gait. The clinical implications of these findings are presented.\r"

Plastic surgeons relying on a positive family history as sufficient indication for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy need to be aware that such a history may be the contrivance of a patient with Munchausen's syndrome. A high index of suspicion may enable the plastic surgeon to recognize Munchausen's syndrome and thus avoid both contributing to the patient's illness and performing an unwarranted operation.\r"

The goniometer was related to a standard anatomic landmark (the Frankfort plane), and the subject's head was inclined through angles of 0 to -35 degrees. With the subject fixing on a constant point, the degree of white showing between the lower eyelid and the limbus was measured. The results demonstrated that scleral show was a normal finding, the degree of which increases with increasing inclination of the head from the Frankfort plane. No sex variation or increase with age was noted.\r"

  ".U": "87261434\r", 
  ".W": "Classical techniques, such as wedge resection, are well suited for mild cases of lower lid ectropion, but they often fail to cure severe cases. The reason these techniques often fail is because they address only the laxity and elongation of the ectropic lid, not the root cause. In nearly every case of severe ectropion, the root cause is importance of the pretarsal orbicularis muscle; i.e., there is inadequate muscle support for the pretarsal lower eyelid. A bipedicled musculocutaneous flap, transferred from the upper lid, was used to treat nine cases of severe lower eyelid ectropion. Eight patients had a good/excellent result. Four patients had electromyographic studies in the late postoperative period, without a single instance of even mild denervation. In cases of severe ectropion, this flap is an effective replacement for the missing skin and impotent muscle. It uses the often discarded blepharoplasty tissue, which has a perfect color and texture match. A single anatomic unit is rebuilt, transferring a strong new muscle strap with ideal supporting vectors and leaving scars in natural creases. This \"blepharoplasty flap\" may prove useful in other types of eyelid reconstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Refinements in the triangular flap closure of the unilateral cleft lip are presented. Randall's mathematical interpretation of the Tennison repair has been extended by using a series of arcs to determine the crucial points which form the triangular flap. Using this easily taught method, an isosceles triangular flap can be plotted which will interdigitate into the noncleft side of the lip. Two symmetrical vertical distances on either side of the cleft are thus formed. This allows for a standardized repair which may be more readily taught than the rotation-advancement technique. In addition, flaps are created which are turned medically toward the cleft and are used to accentuate the philtral pout, close the nostril floor, and reinforce the lip repair, allowing closure of even extremely wide clefts in one stage. These refinements in using the triangular flap closure for the repair of the unilateral cleft lip are diagrammatically presented. We believe that these refinements enhance the results of this closure.\r"

This is a preliminary report with a follow-up of 8 months or less.\r"
