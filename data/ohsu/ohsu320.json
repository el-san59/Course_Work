Measurements of voluntary, horizontal non-predictable saccades showed that the eye motor function was abnormal in six (55 per cent) of the eleven patients. The saccades were hypometric in all six instances and the saccadic velocity was reduced in four instances. The abnormalities observed are consistent with brain dysfunction, in most cases probably indicating pontocerebellar involvement. In five instances ABR was found to be abnormal which indicates brainstem dysfunction. Oculomotor dysfunction and/or ABR abnormality was observed in eight (73 per cent) of the patients studied.\r"

The present study confirms the hypothesis that Bell's palsy has a viral or autoimmune aetiology resulting in a generalized polyneuropathy or mononeuritis multiplex. Paralysis is clinically more manifest in the facial nerve than other motor nerves; this is because of the peculiar anatomical course of the facial nerve inside a bony canal.\r"

These are usually triggered by potent inhalation anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants. Because of the extraordinary risk of death in patients who are at risk, otolaryngologists may be reluctant to operate on these patients. Ten such patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, myringotomy with ventilation tube insertion, and nasal polypectomy were anesthetized with nitrous oxide, barbiturates, opiates, tranquilizers and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants without complication. The patients were not treated prophylactically with dantrolene. Cardiac monitoring and rectal temperatures were followed. All ten patients had vastus lateralis muscle biopsy performed and subsequent caffeine/halothane contracture studies completed. The contracture study was positive in eight out of the patients studied. No anesthetic or surgical complications were encountered. This study demonstrates that patients at risk of developing MH crisis can have otolaryngologic procedures performed safely while undergoing appropriately selected general anesthesia.\r"

A four state (remission, active, flare and death) homogeneous Markov chain was constructed to determine the transition probabilities between disease states, the probability of disease states over the subsequent 25 years, time in each disease state, and life expectancy. Approximately 85% of the clinical course of patients was in the active disease state; no patient made a transition directly between remission and flare; virtually all deaths occurred from the flare disease state. The proportion of the patient population in each disease state over time provided a convenient graphic summary of the natural history of SLE that supplemented the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. A Markov model analysis yields a clinically useful description of outcome for multistate diseases that supplements survival curves.\r"

Hemoglobin A1 (HbA1) was measured by a disposable microcolumn technique in a large, geographically defined population of diabetic persons in southern Wisconsin. During the study, incubation of blood samples to remove pre-A1c was implemented. Multiple linear regression using data from a group of 788 patients yielded the equation: incubated HbA1 = 0.897 (non-incubated HbA1)-0.00332 (blood glucose) + 0.388. This equation was \"validated\" by substituting the calculated value of incubated HbA1 for the actual value in a multinomial logistic regression with diabetic retinopathy as the dependent variable. Little change in the model resulted from the substitution. Further validation was obtained from an independent sample of diabetic persons. Calculated values of incubated HbA1 were an average of 0.4% lower than the actual values.\r"

We also examine the implications of adjusting for initial value in certain observational studies. When group assignment is known to be related to initial value, we argue that this adjustment procedure is inappropriate. The results are illustrated using data from a longitudinal study of lung function decline.\r"

Therefore, the independent relation of diabetes to arteriographically-documented coronary artery disease (CAD) was examined in 5620 patients (18% female) referred to two Milwaukee hospitals from 1972 to 1986. As assessed by questionnaire, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among these patients was 8% (n = 466). Diabetics had increased CAD (assessed by the number and severity of stenoses) even after accounting for levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. In addition, regression analyses indicated that as compared with nondiabetics, female diabetics tended to have a greater increase in CAD than did male diabetics (p = 0.06 for sex x diabetes interaction). Although adverse levels of other risk factors did not increase the association between diabetes and CAD, female diabetics who were using oral hypoglycemics or insulin showed almost a two-fold increase in CAD severity (p less than 0.01). Results suggest that the higher relative risk of coronary heart disease among female (vs male) diabetics may be due to a proportionately greater increase in atherosclerosis.\r"

Thirty-six North Carolina physicians, either practitioners experienced in disability determinations (26) or employees of the Social Security disability agency (10), responded to 48 clinical vignettes. They rated each case on a scale of 0 to 1.0, according to their degree of certainty that the patient was disabled. All combinations of five patient variables were presented in the vignettes: pain (mild or severe), physical examination (normal, reflex loss or muscular weakness), mobility (normal or restricted), X-rays (normal or osteoarthritis), and occupational history (normal or light work). The mean certainties for the individual vignettes ranged from 0.08 to 0.43. Mean certainty estimates across physicians ranged from 0 to 0.61, indicating substantial variability in how physicians assess disability. Practicing physicians had higher certainty of patients' disability than did physicians employed by Social Security, 0.37 vs 0.07 (p less than 0.01). Degree of pain was not associated with certainty of disability. All other clinical factors were highly significant predictors of physician assessment of certainty of disability. The emphasis on physical and radiographic findings over history places disability evaluation distinctly apart from other medical assessments.\r"

In a 9-year prospective study of 1706 children hospitalized with acute respiratory illnesses, 565 children had documented RSV infections. A subsequent bacterial infection rarely developed in those with RSV lower respiratory tract disease. The rate of subsequent bacterial infection was 1.2% in the total group of children infected with RSV, and 0.6% in the 352 children who received no antibiotics. A significantly greater proportion (4.5%) of subsequent bacterial infections occurred in infants who received parenteral antibiotics (p = 0.01), and especially in a subgroup who received parenteral antibiotics for 5 or more days (11%, p less than 0.001). We conclude that the risk of secondary bacterial infection appears to be low for most infants with RSV infection. In a few infants given parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics the risk may be greater, but whether this is related to the antibiotic therapy or to other risk factors is not clear.\r"

The prevalence of one or more of the deviant behavior syndromes identified by the CBCL was 11.1%. From a number of subject characteristics recorded throughout infancy, age-specific determinants for the occurrence of these deviant behaviors were identified. Characteristics most consistently associated with preschool psychopathology included the mother's ill health and lack of social support, the presence of chronic illness in the child, and the frequent use of hospital emergency services. These and other determinant (risk) indicators were entered into logistic regression (LR) models to derived adjusted relative risk estimates for the occurrence of a behavior disorder. The derived LR equations emphasize the important role of both the mother as well and the father and the health of the child.\r"

As a group, the patients with celiac disease had significantly higher levels of antigliadin antibodies of both IgG and IgA classes (p less than or equal to 0.001). However, there was a significant overlap of values, resulting in respective sensitivities and specificities of 88% and 90% for IgG antigliadin antibodies, and 73% and 65% for IgA antigliadin antibodies. The combined use of both IgG and IgA antigliadin antibody levels produced a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 90%. A gluten-free diet in celiac patients did not seem to affect these results. We conclude that the antigliadin antibody ELISA assay cannot be used as a definitive diagnostic test for celiac disease. The small-bowel biopsy remains the principal diagnostic method; the ELISA assay should, at best, be considered a screening test for this disease.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed our single-hospital experience with patients in whom Kawasaki disease was diagnosed from January 1979 to July 1987. Only 3 of 68 (4%) patients treated with intravenous gamma globulin in the first 10 days of illness developed coronary artery abnormalities (one of the three had abnormalities before gamma globulin therapy), in comparison with 39 of 119 (33%) patients not treated with gamma globulin (p less than 0.001). Giant coronary artery aneurysms, which are associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality rates in Kawasaki disease, developed in none of the 68 patients treated with gamma globulin but in 7 of 119 patients (6%) not treated with gamma globulin (p = 0.04). Intravenous gamma globulin appears to be effective not only in reducing the overall prevalence of coronary artery abnormalities in Kawasaki disease but, more important, in preventing the formation of giant aneurysms, the most serious form of coronary abnormality after this illness.\r"

Patients with cystic fibrosis had significantly lower bone density (10% lower, p less than 0.001) than in controls. The decrease in bone density in patients with cystic fibrosis was unrelated to age. Shwachman clinical evaluation scores (based on case history, pulmonary physical findings, growth, and x-ray findings) correlated positively with age-standardized bone density values (p less than 0.01). Male patients had substantially lower bone density than did female patients (p less than 0.02), but bone density differences related to gender were not significant when effects of disease severity were controlled for. Decreased bone density was more common in patients with poor nutritional status as determined by anthropometric measurements (p less than 0.05). We conclude that osteoporosis is a frequent complication in children with cystic fibrosis regardless of their age and is more prevalent in patients with greater disease severity.\r"

Review of 62 family histories and pedigrees was not helpful in differentiating these two groups for counseling purposes. However, mothers who had one affected child appeared to be at much higher risk for having subsequent affected children (9 of 10) if phenytoin use was continued through future pregnancies than were mothers whose first-born child was unaffected despite being exposed to phenytoin during the pregnancy (5 of 52 among all families, or 1 of 48 when only children exposed throughout the entire pregnancy were included). The difference between families with the first exposed child affected and first exposed child unaffected was highly statistically significant (p less than 0.0001). School and learning problems and developmental or mental retardation were present in both groups, and significantly more frequently in affected families. Physical and growth abnormalities were noted in both affected and unaffected family groups, also at a significantly higher rate in affected families.\r"

Developmental disabilities and cardiovascular disease were the major concerns in childhood. The older children developed progressive joint limitation and hypertonia. Adult patients were handicapped by their developmental disabilities. Hypertension, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary problems occurred frequently. Independent living and competitive employment were limited less by the individual's physical problems than by the psychologic and adaptive limitations.

We hypothesized that the following are significant risk factors for perinatal asphyxia: poor third-trimester glycemic control, diabetic vascular disease (nephropathy, retinopathy) appearing in pregnancy, pregnancy-associated hypertension, smoking, prematurity, fetal macrosomia, and maternal hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia within 6 hours preceding delivery. We prospectively studied 162 infants born to 149 diabetic mothers (White classes B through R-T). Perinatal asphyxia was defined clinically as fetal distress during labor (late decelerations, persistent fetal bradycardia, or both), 1-minute Apgar score less than or equal to 6, or intrauterine fetal death. Forty-four infants (26.7%) had perinatal asphyxia. The presence of perinatal asphyxia did not correlate with third-trimester glycemic control, pregnancy-associated hypertension, smoking, fetal macrosomia, or maternal hypoglycemia before delivery, but it did correlate significantly with nephropathy appearing in pregnancy, maternal hyperglycemia before delivery, and prematurity. We speculate that (1) the appearance of diabetic vasculopathy (nephropathy) during pregnancy is accompanied by placental vascular disease and subsequently by fetal compromise and (2) in pregnancy complicated by diabetes, maternal and subsequently fetal hyperglycemia before delivery leads to fetal hypoxemia.\r"

The EEG abnormalities could not be predicted on the basis of clinical neurologic dysfunction or perinatal variables. On follow-up, 9 of the 17 abnormal EEGs remained abnormal during the second week of life. One infant had an abnormal first EEG at 13 days of age. By 3 to 12 months of age, however, 9 of the 10 previously abnormal tracing had normalized and one is pending. These transient clinical and EEG abnormalities may be the result of changes in neurotransmitter availability and function.\r"

The specimens were examined by means of polarized light microscopy. Surfactant could be simply and rapidly identified by its appearance as birefringent particles in volumes of aspirate as little as 1 microliter. Tracheal aspirate specimens from 108 babies, obtained on the first day of life, were examined without knowledge of the patient's clinical details. When the samples from each baby were subdivided into three groups on the basis of the amount of surfactant particles seen, this subgrouping corresponded well with the babies' ventilatory requirements at the time of sample collection. This method of detecting surfactant material may prove valuable in determining the degree of surfactant deficiency in individual preterm babies with respiratory illness.\r"

Both incubators maintained environmental temperatures corresponding overall to the set point, despite incubator openings. Under skin temperature servocontrol, however, environmental temperature fluctuations were greater than 2 degrees C even in strictly controlled conditions. The pattern of incubator temperature fluctuations depended on the set point rather than on the type of incubator (conventionally heated or heated by warm air blown between the double walls). The long-term clinical significance of the incubator temperature variability remains to be determined; the choice between air and skin servocontrolling should depend in part on the need for environmental stability.\r"

Clinically symptomatic hyperkalemia resulting in significant electrocardiographic dysrhythmias developed in eight of these infants; 10 babies remained normokalemic. Peak serum potassium concentration ranged from 6.9 to 9.2 mEq/L in the hyperkalemic group; all potassium values in the normokalemic group were less than 6.6 mEq/L. Indices of renal glomerular function and urine output were similar in both groups; no infant had oliguria. Serum creatinine concentrations were the same in both groups (1.04 +/- 0.16 SD mg/dl in normokalemic vs 1.19 +/- 0.24 mg/dl in hyperkalemic infants, beta less than 0.2 at alpha = 0.05), and glomerular filtration rates did not differ significantly (6.29 +/- 1.78 ml/min/1.73 m2 in normokalemic vs 5.70 +/- 1.94 ml/min/1.73 m2 in hyperkalemic infants, beta less than 0.2 at alpha = 0.05). In contrast, indicators of tubular function revealed a significantly larger fractional excretion of sodium in hyperkalemic infants: 13.9 +/- 5.4% versus 5.6 +/- 0.9% in normokalemic control subjects (p less than 0.001). Hyperkalemic infants also had a tendency toward lower urine concentrations of potassium, although there was no significant difference in their net potassium excretion in comparison with that in the normokalemic group. We speculate that hyperkalemia in the tiny baby is in part the result of immature distal tubule function with a compromise in ability to regulate potassium balance.\r"

These patients have no capacity to synthesize LDL receptors. During lovastatin therapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day, there was no decrease in LDL-cholesterol levels, nor was the turnover rate of LDL affected by the drug. The only significant change was a 74% drop in very low-density lipoprotein during treatment. We conclude that lovastatin is not effective in treatment of receptor-negative homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The most likely mechanism of action for this drug is to increase LDL receptor activity.\r"

Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either no treatment (control) or met-hGH (0.125 mg/kg three times per week), oxandrolone (0.125 mg/kg/day), or combination met-hGH plus oxandrolone. At the end of an initial period of 12 to 20 months, patients in the original control and oxandrolone groups were given combination met-hGH plus oxandrolone. At that time the dosage of oxandrolone was lowered to 0.0625 mg/kg/day. Sixty-five subjects have now completed the first 3 years of the study. Compared with the control growth rate for year 1 (3.8 cm/yr), significant increases in growth rate were seen in all 3 years of combination therapy (9.8, 7.4, and 6.1 cm/yr, respectively) and in the first 2 years of treatment with met-hGH alone (6.6, 5.4, and 4.6 cm/yr). When growth velocity was expressed as standard deviation for age in girls with Turner syndrome, significant increases relative to the control group for year 1 (-0.1 SD) were seen in all three years of both combination therapy and met-hGH alone (combination, +6.6, +4.3, +3.0 SD; met-hGH, +3.1, +2.0, +1.4 SD). After 3 years of treatment, predicted adult height by the method of Bayley-Pinneau increased 4.5 cm in the met-hGH group and 8.2 cm in the combination group.\r"

Cartilage damage as a result of chronic inflammation occurred to a lesser extent in mast cell deficient mice. The flare reaction of antigen induced arthritis was significantly less vehement in mast cell deficient mice considering tissue swelling, but only tendentiously different when the exudate was scored. Our results indicate that mast cells contribute to cartilage damage and may play an enhancing role in the flare reaction of arthritis in mice.\r"

The comparison group was similarly evaluated, using 10 outpatients with active RA to whom hospitalization was recommended, but refused by the patients. Both groups were studied intensively over a 12-week period. In addition, a 2-year followup was performed on 12 test group inpatients and 8 comparison group outpatients, using the same variables plus a functional status questionnaire. Health care costs were determined for both groups and corrected for a 1985 dollar value. The test group showed significant improvement in morning stiffness, pain, and joint score, whereas the comparison group improved only in pain score during the initial 12-week period. At 2 years, the test group and the comparison group showed significant improvement in morning stiffness, pain, grip strength, and joint score. The comparison group initially had a somewhat lower index of disease activity. The test group maintained their initial improvement and none required rehospitalization. Functional status scores were similar for both groups. Health care costs were initially higher for the test group ($5,065); followup care cost for the test group was $99 less/year than the comparison group over 2 years. Hospitalization on a rheumatic disease unit brought about prompt, sustained improvement in 2 weeks which required nearly 2 years to achieve in the comparison group. Such hospitalization of uncomplicated RA seems warranted to decrease disability and increase the quality of life.\r"

An in vitro study investigated the effect of sulfasalazine and its metabolites on mitogen response by healthy and RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-hydroxy SP suppressed the response of RA PBMC to Con-A. Sulfasalazine, SP and N-acetyl SP suppressed the response of healthy PBMC to pokeweed mitogen. 5-aminosalicylic acid also affected mitogen response and cell viability, which may be relevant to actions of this metabolite within the gut.\r"

Sulfasalazine, but not its 2 main metabolites, inhibited mitogen induced proliferative responses of PMB at high drug concentrations (100 micrograms/ml). Similar results were obtained with purified B lymphocytes. Sulfasalazine depressed, in a dose dependent manner, pokeweed mitogen induced Ig synthesis by PBM of normals and patients with RA. Moreover, synthesis of IgM rheumatoid factor was depressed to a greater degree than total IgM at low sulfasalazine concentrations (10-25 micrograms/ml). Both SP and 5-ASA were not inhibitory at the concentrations tested. Experiments with purified lymphocyte subpopulations indicated that sulfasalazine exerted its major inhibitory activity on the B lymphocyte. These studies indicate that sulfasalazine, but not its 2 main metabolites, has immunomodulatory characteristics which may be related to its therapeutic activity in RA.\r"

The findings aided the regulation of therapy, particularly the administration of immunosuppressive drugs.\r"

All the patients had normal computerized tomographic scans. Four patients with abnormal magnetic resonance imaging studies had active central nervous system disease. None of the 9 patients with normal scans had active nervous system involvement at the time of study. Parenchymal lesions were usually located in the region of the corticomedullary junction or in the deep periventricular white matter. In coronal sections, some of the corticomedullary lesions extended centripetally as thin irregular lines into the white matter approximating the course of penetrating arterioles of the brain. The parenchymal lesions resolved in 4 months in 1 patient, but persisted unchanged in the others despite clinical improvement or a stable clinical course. It is likely that the parenchymal lesions of these patients represent intrinsic vasculopathy of small cerebral vessels and perivascular microinfarctions associated with SLE.\r"

We studied the full obstetric histories of 8 women with SLE who had taken either chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate (Plaquenil) throughout the entire length of at least 1 pregnancy. These 8 women had 14 pregnancies while receiving antimalarial drugs. Fetal wastage was high in these patients, regardless of antimalarial therapy, and was almost 100% in patients who were clinically active. Six normal full term spontaneous deliveries resulted from these pregnancies with clinically healthy normal babies born despite exposure to antimalarial therapy throughout the pregnancies.\r"

Five patients with normal labial salivary gland biopsies were shown to have idiopathic hypertrophic sialosis with enlarged parotids identified by the parotid biopsy. Five additional patients were diagnosed with lymphoma occurring within the parotid glands of patients with Sjogren's disease, via the parotid biopsies, that were not identifiable with the labial minor salivary gland biopsy. The parotid biopsy consistently identified each disease entity in an earlier stage, and with more evident histopathology. Neither technique showed appreciable morbidity.

Half of the patients were male. Calcifications were found in 27 (20.7%) cases, all over 60 years of age. There were 15.4% males and 26.1% females affected. The incidence of intraarticular calcifications in females increased from 11.1-37.5% and in males from 20-29.4% for the 60-69 year age group and the over 80-year age group, respectively. One third of affected cases had only meniscal and 2/3 had both meniscal and chondral calcifications. Isolated meniscal calcifications were found more often in 1 and mixed meniscal and chondral calcifications were found in both knees. Severe destructive articular cartilage lesions were observed significantly more often in joints with intraarticular calcifications than in joints of age matched subjects without calcifications. Joints with calcifications showed little evidence of synovial inflammation. Similarly, no specific relationship was found between the presence of crystal and amyloid deposits in the knees examined.\r"

We performed a survey of our small, relatively short term (3-year average) dialysis population of 45 patients to establish a prevalence figure and establish a data base to assess risk factors. Destructive spondyloarthropathy was seen in 4 of 34 patients receiving hemodialysis and in 2 patients receiving chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Age of the patient (p less than 0.09) and duration of dialysis (p less than 0.05) seem to be associated risk factors. Although it may be coincidental, radiological and biochemical hyperparathyroidism can be clearly dissociated from destructive spondyloarthropathy. The very peculiar quasiconstant, asymptomatic and early cervical localization of destructive spondyloarthropathy suggests a local mechanical factor accentuated by crystal and/or amyloid deposition disease which may become overwhelming as survival is prolonged.\r"

Mean concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I and II were below normal for age whether or not prednisone was being given. Growth failure during periods of active disease was observed in both groups. Only 4 of 11 prepubertal children in whom growth rates were measured grew 4.5 cm or more/year. However, longitudinal studies of individual children showed that lowest growth rates occurred while taking prednisone and that growth rates were not correlated to insulin-like growth factor levels.\r"

The ultrastructure of control and of experimental tissues was compared with that of similar, previous studies made in beagles. Both forms of foxhound control tissue were indistinguishable from normal beagle femoral condylar cartilage. Ultrastructural changes observed in the foxhound up to 16 weeks after cruciate ligament surgery were closely similar to those recorded in the beagle; they included alterations of chondrocyte morphology and the deposition of an electron dense cartilage surface coat. However, the degree of cartilage disorganization after 64 weeks was greater than, and qualitatively distinct from, that observed in the beagle.\r"

  ".W": "The production of hydrogen peroxide by polymorphonuclear cells is suspected as being a cause of cellular damage during acute inflammation. In our study, the kinetics by which hydrogen peroxide suppressed proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage explant culture suggested that the damage occurred at the level of core protein synthesis. Chondrocytes were also shown to contain both catalase and the glutathione peroxidase/reductase systems, which were both involved in the removal of 10(-4) M H2O2. Interruption of either of these peroxide metabolizing systems markedly sensitized cartilage to a greater inhibition of synthesis by H2O2. Inhibition of catalase (with 3-amino 1,2,4 triazole or azide) was found to depress synthesis further, possibly because of exposure to higher steady state levels of H2O2. Inhibition of glutathione reductase (with 1,3-bis-(choloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea) did not expose tissue to higher steady state levels of H2O2, but this treatment decreased the intrachondrocyte level of reduced glutathione which may explain the increased damage obtained in the presence of H2O2. These results support the concept that effective H2O2 metabolizing systems are important in the maintenance of normal biosynthetic rates in cartilage during inflammation.\r"

Twenty-two residents in obstetrics and gynecology, medicine, and family medicine were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. The experimental groups received instruction and feedback about teaching skills during their first and second postgraduate years. Both groups were evaluated at three times: in the first year before the instructional program, in the second year during the instructional program, and in the third year six months after instruction. During each study phase, videotapes were made of each resident teaching a student in the context of a case presentation. Trained raters evaluated eight teaching skills exhibited in the videotapes. In general, there was greater increase and less decline in the scores of the experimental than the control groups. These data suggest that teaching skills can be improved by instruction and that without support residents' teaching skills do not improve in relation to their clinical competence.\r"

In the study reported here, the authors examined some perceived and actual effects of such plans on a family medicine center associated with a family medicine residency training program. In the study, 37 residents and 19 faculty members completed a 5-point, 16-item survey covering the effect of the prepaid plans used at the center on the program's practice profile, cost-containment efforts, and education activities over a three-year period. Overall, the respondents agreed with the need for cost containment that accompanied participation in the prepaid plan and agreed that prepaid plans increased the number of patient visits and visits by family members. The residents and faculty members agreed that prepaid patients were more demanding and were seen more often for minor or inappropriate problems. Regarding the educational impact of the prepaid plans, the respondents agreed that they improved their clinical decision-making, and no significant concern regarding limitation of laboratory or consultations was noted. Some of the respondents' perceptions were corroborated by findings in the clinic data base that showed increased numbers of patient visits, more visits by members of the same family, and no significant change in outpatient consultation rates.\r"

Therefore, in 1985 a group of students developed a four-hour workshop designed to teach fellow students about ethnic and cultural issues in patient care. Since then the workshop, which uses videotaped vignettes, discussions, and role-playing exercises, has become a required part of the Introduction to Clinical Medicine course for all second-year students. Evaluation of the program in 1985 compared pretest and posttest questionnaires. The participants showed improvement in understanding several specific issues discussed during the workshop, but overall no significant differences were found. In 1986 and 1987, evaluations were based upon the students' attitudes about content, format effectiveness, and subject matter. They consistently responded favorably in all these areas.\r"

Sixty fourth-year medical students in a required ambulatory care rotation were randomly selected and randomly assigned to one of four conditions. All students interviewed a simulated patient who presented with one of five main complaints, and the interview was videotaped. Students were assigned to a control group or to one of three intervention groups: viewing a self-instruction videotape, viewing and critiquing a videotape of their interview, or both of these activities. The students assigned to the control group did not participate in any educational interventions. At the end of the intervention period, the students again interviewed a simulated patient and were videotaped. The 120 videotaped interviews were reliably rated by a scoring system developed by the project team. The postintervention interviews conducted by students in the two groups that used the self-instruction videotape received significantly higher ratings than those in the control group. These results suggest that this self-instruction intervention can improve the interviewing skills of senior medical students.\r"

A modest (30%), though significant, effect in making cells cortisol sensitive was observed. Moreover, AZA enhanced tumor growth inhibition by cortisol in the corresponding sensitive line. The AZA alone was cytostatic, but it had no effect on DNA synthesis. The drug did not alter cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor levels or affinity, but nuclear levels were increased in the sensitive tumor. Results suggest that glucocorticoid resistance may be partially reversible and that the effect of AZA may be at the gene-expression level.\r"

After death, tissues from each animal were evaluated for the presence of several types of tumors by one of a team of NCTR pathologists. After the ED01 experiment was completed, the Society of Toxicology commissioned another pathologist to carry out an independent review of the bladder and liver specimens from a stratified sample of the mice. There were substantial differences in the diagnoses of both tumor types by the pathologists, but the implications for detection of a dose-response relationship are important only for liver carcinomas.\r"

It is shown that the best fit of this model in continuing smokers gives predictions not in accordance with incidence in ex-smokers and dose-response. A better global fit can be obtained by increasing the number of stages, but this de-emphasizes initiation and is inconsistent with the rise of incidence in nonsmokers. Thus, one should look to other models. A two-stage model with clonal growth in which smoking initiates normal target cells and promotes the clonal growth of just the smoke-initiated cells is proposed. This model is shown to agree with the Doll and Hill data and thus it has empirical plausibility that should encourage biological studies of clonal growth in carcinogenesis.\r"

Benign tumors showed a weaker positive association, and exposure before age 20 to a major diagnostic examination (full-mouth or panoramic dental radiography or medical radiography to the head) increased risk (relative risk = 1.8; confidence interval = 1.13-2.91). This study also confirmed the association of malignant tumors with prior radiation treatment to the head or neck; 28% of these tumors are attributable to exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic and therapeutic radiation.\r"

Polyploidizing growth was observed during normal liver development, dominated by progressive polyploidization and a decrease in the number of diploid cells. Nonpolyploidizing growth was seen during liver regeneration and after treatment with 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF). This mode of growth was characterized by an increase in all mononucleated ploidy classes in the absence of net polyploidization (no increase in binucleated cells). Additional diploid proliferation was detected after initiation with diethylnitrosamine followed by promotion with AAF. This selectively expanding diploid hepatocyte population, which persisted after AAF withdrawal, could represent the AAF-promoted progeny of diethylnitrosamine-altered cells with constitutive nonpolyploidizing growth properties.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that glucocorticoids can delay or prevent loss of responsiveness to androgens in androgen-deprived cells was investigated. While a complete loss of responsiveness to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was observed within 60 days of androgen deprivation, addition of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) delayed both the loss of growth responsiveness to DHT and the increase in spontaneous growth rate by approximately equal to 60 days. When the growth response to DEX was studied, the changes found were similar to those described above for DHT, namely loss of response following steroid deprivation and preservation of response in cells preincubated with DHT or DEX. In addition, long-term incubation in the presence of DEX was accompanied by low-amplitude stimulation of cell growth at extremely low concentrations of DHT and DEX, suggesting that androgen- and glucocorticoid-hypersensitive cell clones developed during androgen deprivation. The present data show that long-term incubation of androgen-sensitive Shionogi cells leads not only to an increase in the spontaneous growth rate, but also to the appearance of androgen- and glucocorticoid-hypersensitive cells, which may well play an important role in the development of resistance to endocrine therapy in human hormone-sensitive cancers. Although it is not as efficient as DHT, the glucocorticoid DEX can delay the loss of androgen sensitivity in this cell line.\r"

Forty-nine cases of lower cervical spine fracture (C3-C7) were reviewed. Twenty-eight patients underwent early operative fusion followed by immobilization with either halo vests, or hard cervical collars, and 20 patients were initially immobilized in halo vests only. One patient refused treatment and was kept in a hard cervical collar. The average period of immobilization was 3 months. Eight patients in the halo vest group demonstrated radiographic evidence of spinal instability following immobilization (40%). Five of these eight patients subsequently required operative stabilization. Two of these five suffered progression of neurologic deficit secondary to loss of reduction while immobilized. Spinal instability occurred in two of the 28 patients initially fused (7%) (p less than 0.01), and in the patient treated in a collar. The findings indicate: 1) the halo vest does not protect patients with cervical instability from neurological injury, nor does it absolutely immobilize the cervical spine; 2) surgery may be required to provide spinal stability, even after a 3-month orthotic treatment period; and 3) there appears to be an increased rate of spinal stability with fusion and immobilization versus immobilization alone.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-three cases of injury to the vertebral artery are reviewed. Trauma to these cervical vessels requires deep tissue penetration, most often as a result of gunshot or stabwounds. The majority of patients are hemodynamically stable, although serious hemorrhage and death may result from injury to this artery alone. Injury to the vertebral artery was frequently associated with cervical spine fracture and local neural damage. However, no patient presented with or developed neurologic sequelae attributable to vertebral-basilar ischemia. Arteriography accurately identified the site of injury, but the specific arteriographic diagnosis can be unreliable. Two of 13 patients (15%) treated by proximal vascular control alone had postoperative vascular complications. While direct surgical intervention with proximal and distal arterial ligation is the appropriate treatment of acute injuries, in some cases there may be a role for conservative treatment of minimal injuries. In this series, mortality related to a vertebral artery injury was low (4.7%), likely as a result of accurate diagnosis and prompt operative intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Regional hypothermia is known to protect many tissues from ischemic injury. We investigated the relationship between regional hypothermia and skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury in a bilateral in vivo isolated canine gracilis muscle model. In five anesthetized dogs, one gracilis muscle was subjected to 6 hours of ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion while the contralateral muscle served as a nonischemic control. Localization and quantitation of skeletal muscle injury was determined by histochemical staining with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) followed by computerized planimetry of the infarct size. Muscle pH and temperature were monitored continuously in the proximal, middle, and distal segments by using pH electrodes and needle thermistors. Muscle pH was calculated by use of the Nernst equation with temperature correction, and hydrogen ion washout rates (H+) were derived from the observed change in muscle pH during reperfusion. A significant (p less than 0.05) regional hypothermia was observed in the distal third of the muscle. The preischemic temperature in the distal muscle was 27 +/- 2 degrees (SEM) C, compared to 34 +/- 1 degree and 32 +/- 2 degrees C in the proximal and middle segments of muscle, respectively. This temperature gradient was sustained throughout the experiment. The distal third of the ischemic muscle demonstrated significantly less (p less than 0.05) injury than the proximal and middle thirds as measured by TTC infarct size (31 +/- 10%, compared to 71 +/- 3% and 78 +/- 6%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty patients with Crotalidae snake bites were evaluated and treated over a 7-year period. Twenty-six patients received a total of 507 vials of antivenin, the dose correlating with the clinical severity of envenomation. All patients were skin tested. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurred in six patients (23%). Cutaneous manifestations alone occurred in three of these patients, while systemic anaphylaxis occurred in three. Twenty patients were available for followup, and ten (50%) developed serum sickness. Skin testing was not reliable in predicting the development of immediate (anaphylaxis) or delayed (serum sickness) hypersensitivity reactions. Treatment of antivenin allergic reactions was uniformly effective, with no mortality, minimal morbidity, and no chronic sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "Open reduction and internal fixation of facial fractures demand a detailed understanding of the three-dimensional pattern of injury. This is difficult if not impossible to obtain with present radiographic methods. The purpose of this study was to define the role of three-dimensional computerized tomography (3DCT) in surgical management of facial fractures. The two-part investigation: 1) compared the diagnostic accuracy of 3DCT with conventional CT and plain film studies; and 2) examined the clinical usefulness of 3DCT to surgeons. Twenty-four acute trauma patients suspected of having facial fractures were examined radiographically with analysis of every facial bone and specific facial regions. Particular attention was directed to the course of the fracture lines and the number, size, and displacement of fracture fragments. The surgeons were then asked to conceptualize the reported and the personally observed radiographic information and document their impressions on preprinted diagrams of the facial skeleton. They also completed questionnaires designed to indicate whether patient management would be influenced by the 3DCT. The radiographic findings were correlated with intraoperative observations. The 3DCT provided superior definition of fracture lines (especially horizontal) and the extent of comminution was better appreciated. This additional information improved the surgeons' ability to plan placement of interfragmentary wires and/or plates. Surgeons were also able to more accurately predict those patients requiring immediate bone grafting. Large, life-size 3D images of the facial skeleton made intraoperative conceptualization of the injury pattern easier. The accuracy of the 3DCT images corroborated the intraoperative findings in all cases. The following conclusions are offered: 1) The diagnosis of most mandibular fractures can be made equally well with conventional and 3DCT techniques. 2) Improved diagnosis of fracture lines and the specific patterns of comminution in midface fractures is made possible with 3DCT. 3) If open reduction and internal fixation is the mode of treatment, 3DCT is desirable because the added information makes preoperative planning more accurate and thereby facilitates surgical intervention.\r"

Serum from ten patients who received CK grafts as part of burn wound coverage was studied by ELISA technique for antibody to these xenogeneic antigens. All patients had some amount of antibody to FBS but no detectable antibody to MF. The amount of antibody to FBS varied between patients and with respect to time after graft application. Generally, the levels of antibody to FBS were moderate by 30 days, declined, and then rose slowly by 5 to 6 months. The majority of antibody to FBS was against bovine serum albumin (BSA), demonstrated by Western blot technique. The presence of such antibody to FBS might produce clinical problems of graft rejection, anaphylaxis, and serum sickness in patients receiving CK grown in FBS supplemental medium. Further investigation will need to determine the likelihood and potential severity of such clinical problems.\r"

Although the Journal of Trauma provides a consistent edifying mixture of study designs, there is a relative need for less descriptive retrospective/prospective reviews and case reports, and for more observational and interventional cohort designs. More precise documentation of specific research criteria would better substantiate scientific conclusions.

Followup ranged from 2 to 36 months. There were no graft occlusions. The advantages of using NTSV graft for reconstruction of arterial injuries include autogenous reconstruction, reduced size discrepancy between graft and artery at both the proximal and distal anastomosis, improved hemodynamics when spasm compromises distal runoff, and increased vein utilization. NTSV provides increased versatility with both large and small vessel trauma and may improve patency rates.\r"

Ninety-two patients with 96 renal injuries treated by a variety of surgical methods were evaluated to determine whether outcome was influenced by the extent of renal injury (minor, major, vascular, or bilateral) or the method of treatment (exploration alone, renorrhaphy, partial nephrectomy, nephrectomy, vascular repair, combined surgery, or bilateral surgery). Each patient was assessed for the extent of associated injury (injury score, transfusion requirement), the presence of shock, degree of hematuria, type of injury and method of repair, incidence of major complications, and azotemia (creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl). Eight patients died, ten developed azotemia, and 35 developed a major complication. There was a statistically significant association between the extent of injury and the development of azotemia. A statistically significant relationship was noted between the type of repair (nephrectomy, combined and bilateral surgery) and the development of azotemia, major complication and eventual death. These relationships, however, seemed to be a product of the extent of associated injury and consequent development of sepsis and multiple organ failure rather than the extent of renal injury or the method of repair.\r"

It is postulated that SAP is a degradation fragment of a large serum-borne protein, possibly FN. Human trauma serum (HTS) and elastase-degraded human FN were run over an AFFI prepared with monoclonal antibody to SAP. Bound protein was eluted with 2M NaCl and dialyzed to remove salt. Immunosuppressive activity of HTS and FN eluates was monitored using inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis (CTX). Active fractions were compared to the starting material and controls with 15% PAGE. AFFI eluates of HTS revealed a high molecular weight protein band (450 kd) with no inhibitory CTX activity and singular low molecular weight protein (LMW) band (less than 20,000) with 93% +/- 5% CTX suppression. Elastase-digested purified human FN eluates run under identical conditions over the same AFFI revealed two bands with an identical elution profile as HTS eluates. CTX suppression 95 +/- 5% was seen only with the LMW band. Incubation of enriched LWF fragments of digested FN and HTS with whole FN reversed CTX suppression. This suggests affinity purification of a single LMW suppressive glycopeptide which may bind to or be a degradation product of plasma or cellular fibronectin.\r"

The patients were divided into four groups based upon the results of echocardiography. Group A (n = 35) had normal ECHO and ECG; Group B (n = 16), normal ECHO and abnormal ECG; group C (n = 14), ECHO showing abnormal wall motion and/or pericardial fluid; group D (n = 8), ECHO showing a nontraumatic valvular or wall motion abnormality. Nineteen patients required an operation under general anesthesia. Group C patients had significantly higher CK, CK-MB, numbers of associated injuries, and Injury Severity Scores; seven required invasive hemodynamic monitoring. No cardiac morbidity of general anesthesia was seen. We conclude that echocardiography is an important tool for diagnosis and triage which may be used to stratify a homogeneous patient population into groups with acute, chronic, and no cardiac disease. Cardiac injury occurs in a setting of multisystem trauma. Patients with normal echocardiogram and ECG on admission do not require intensive care monitoring.\r"

A high index of suspicion in patients with nasal tubes who develop unexplained fever or signs of systemic sepsis should prompt appropriate investigation of the paranasal sinuses. Removal of the tubes, antral puncture for irrigation and aspiration for microbiologic culture, topical nasal decongestants, systemic antibiotics based on sensitivity studies, and occasionally, formal surgical sinus drainage contribute to effective therapy.\r"

A technique of \"stress testing\" vascular inflow patterns by temporary occlusion of arterial inflow was utilized to accentuate differences in perfusion not apparent at rest between normal limbs and those with inflow impairment. Changes in postocclusive hyperemic response were monitored by changes in transcutaneous oxygen detected by sensors placed over the dorsum of the foot, at the fracture site, over the anterior compartment, and at the chest. No statistically significant differences were found between the control group and the group of united tibia fractures. Analysis of results using the unpaired Student's t-test demonstrated statistically significant differences between the control and nonunion groups at each limb site tested (p less than 0.05). The prolonged oxygen recovery time values found in more than half the limbs with nonunion are consistent with the presence of impaired oxygenation following physiologic stress. The impairment of oxygenation appears to be on a perfusion basis and reflects the limited capacity of many limbs with tibial nonunion to respond to experimental ischemia with immediate compensatory hyperemia. Clinical relevance: This technique is a feasible method for serially assessing the regional oxygenation of a limb, and substantiates ischemia as a possible factor in the genesis of tibial nonunion.\r"

Hypoxia resulted in an 85% reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without any change in total renal vascular resistance. There was an initial 85% increase in urine flow rate (UV) and a 45% decrease in percent sodium reabsorption due to hypoxic metabolic inhibition of solute reabsorption. As GFR decreased, UV declined to 50% of control. GFR did not increase on reoxygenation. These results suggest that an intrinsic protective tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism is activated during hypoxia that redistributes intrarenal flow to reduce the filtered load and to reduce oxygen demand for solute reabsorption. Delivery of oxygen to the hypoxia-sensitive medulla would also be improved. Decreases in GFR observed with ischemic models of acute renal failure may reflect this protective mechanism in addition to the effects of ischemic injury.\r"

The other eight were visceral: three small bowel (one patient), two pancreatic, and one each of the heart, ureter, and diaphragm. Five patients (42%) died, three with missed vascular and two with missed visceral injuries. Three died due to complications directly related to their missed injuries, while the unrecognized injury did not play a significant role in the other two. Indications for re-operation in patients with vascular injuries were hypotension in two patients, persistent output from drains in three, and refractory acidosis in one. Re-exploration in visceral injuries was for clinical sepsis in three patients, DIC in one, cardiac tamponade in one, and persistent chest tube drainage in one. Eleven of the 12 patients presented to the E.D. in shock. All patients had multiple injuries with a mean of 3.25 organ systems injured. Hypotension, coagulopathy, and/or hypothermia (T less than 92 degrees) were felt to have contributed to missing the injury in five of the patients with vascular, and three of the patients with visceral injuries. In the four other patients, injuries were missed due to inadequate exploration or a low index of suspicion in the presence of multiple injuries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, decrements in metabolic rate between sequential studies correlated only with the change in % open wound and the change in EV (r = 0.41 and 0.49, respectively). While changes in heat loss are not capable of predicting all of the variation in metabolic rate, burned patients demonstrate an increase in heat production largely secondary to the inability to conserve heat effectively in the periphery.

Using this classification, we can be 90% confident that 50 to 69% of patients with \"unstable\" pelvic fractures will require 4 or more units of blood, 30 to 49% will require greater than 10 units of blood, 36 to 55% will have an intra-abdominal injury, and 6 to 18% will have a pelvic arterial injury. Therefore we conclude that this pelvic fracture classification based on the initial emergency-room AP X-ray can predict a patient population at high risk for massive hemorrhage for which an aggressive treatment protocol is justified.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic sepsis is always associated with profound wasting leading to increased release of amino acids from skeletal muscle. Net protein catabolism may be due to decreased rate of synthesis, increased rate of degradation, or both. To determine whether protein synthesis is altered in chronic sepsis, the rate of protein synthesis in vivo was estimated by measuring the incorporation of [3H]-phenylalanine in skeletal muscle protein in a chronic (5-day) septic rat model induced by creation of a stable intra-abdominal abscess using an E. coli + B. fragilis-infected sterile fecal-agar pellet as foreign body nidus. Septic rats failed to gain weight at rates similar to control animals, therefore control animals were weight matched to the septic animals. The skeletal muscle protein content in septic animals was significantly reduced relative to control animals (0.18 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.01 mg protein/gm wet wt; p less than 0.02). The rate of incorporation of [3H]-phenylalanine into skeletal muscle protein from control animals was 39 +/- 4 nmole/gm wet wt/hr or a fractional synthetic rate of 5.2 +/- 0.5%/day. In contrast to control animals, the fractional synthetic rate in septic animals (2.6 +/- 0.2%/day) was reduced by 50% compared to control animals (p less than 0.005). The decreased rate of protein synthesis in sepsis was not due to an energy deficit, as high-energy phosphates and ATP/ADP ratio were not altered. This decrease in protein synthesis occurred even though septic animals consumed as much food as control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent experience with civilian rectal trauma challenges the military dictum advocating routine distal colon washout. Opponents contend that septic morbidity is not influenced by perioperative removal of feces from the rectosigmoid region. In an effort to elucidate this issue, we reviewed 27 consecutive patients sustaining extraperitoneal rectal trauma over the past 5 years. One patient, exsanguinating from abdominal vascular injury, was excluded from further analysis. In the remaining 26 patients, rectal injury was due to gunshot wound in 16 (62%), pelvic fracture in 8 (31%), and stab wound in 2 (7%). The mean Revised Trauma Score was 6.9 +/- 0.4, Abdominal Trauma Index 20.9 +/- 8.1, and Injury Severity Score 28.6 +/- 11.0. Proximal colostomy was done in all patients and presacral drains were placed in 23 (88%). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered for a minimum of 5 days. Thirteen (50%) of the group underwent intraoperative washout of the distal rectosigmoid colon, dictated by attending surgeon's preference; the other half did not. These two groups were otherwise comparable with respect to injury mechanism, shock on arrival, rectal wound severity, associated injuries, and perioperative blood transfusions. Major complications were greater in the no-washout versus washout groups: pelvic abscess, 46% vs. 8%; rectal fistulae, 23% vs. 8%; and sepsis, 15% vs. 8%. The single death (4%) occurred in the no-washout group. Although based on a small group of patients, these trends imply that distal colon washout reduces septic morbidity following civilian rectal trauma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

High-speed (greater than 40 m.p.h.) motor vehicle accident was the most common reason for triage; however, of 2,277 in this group 201 patients (9.0%) had severe injury and four patients (0.2%) died. Only nine deaths (0.9%) occurred in 1,004 patients with penetrating trauma whose Trauma Scores were greater than 12. Of the 8,891 patients 4,791 (53.9%) had moderate to severe injury. The overtriage rate was therefore 46.1% using this field categorization system.\r"

  ".W": "The excretion of inorganic pyrophosphate was studied in daily, fasting and postprandial urine specimens of normocalciuric and hypercalciuric patients with recurrent renal calcium stone disease (40 men and 40 women), and healthy controls (20 men and 20 women). Both populations were subdivided into younger (20 to 40 years old) and older (more than 40 years old) individuals. In general, there was a tendency towards higher urinary pyrophosphate excretion with increasing age (both sexes and all groups studied), and lower excretion in women than in men. The urinary pyrophosphate excretion rate was unchanged in daily and fasting urine specimens of the younger male normocalciuric and idiopathic hypercalciuric stone patients, whereas in the daily and postprandial urine of younger women the median excretion rate was reduced (controls versus normocalciuric plus idiopathic hypercalciuric subjects, 3 versus 1 mumol., p less than 0.05). In contrast, in older men urinary pyrophosphate was reduced in daily specimens (controls versus normocalciuric plus idiopathic hypercalciuric subjects, 55 versus 33 mumol., p less than 0.05) but it was unchanged in fasting urine specimens. In older women no change was detectable in any of the 3 urine portions. Factorization of urinary pyrophosphate for the associated urinary creatinine did not alter these results substantially, and the presence of renal stones did not modify pyrophosphate excretion significantly. Urinary pyrophosphate was correlated significantly with urinary volume, citrate and phosphorus. We conclude that only subclassification of stone patients with respect to sex, age and type of calciuria, and consideration of additional urine portions besides the daily urine may help to uncover states of urinary pyrophosphate deficit. On the basis of the data, we recommend that clinically relevant studies on inhibitory effects of urinary pyrophosphate on the nucleation and growth of crystals and stones should be done preferentially in urine portions with a proved pyrophosphate deficit.\r"

Our study suggests that the optimal treatment with percutaneous ultrasonic lithotripsy should result in a patient who is free of stones.\r"

  ".W": "Infected renal stones can be treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy but it still is not clear whether successful stone fragmentation and the disappearance of all macroscopic stone fragments guarantee eradication of the infection. Therefore, a prospective study was done in 135 patients with renal or upper ureteral stones associated with persistent urinary tract infection. The urinary infection was localized in each patient by bilateral ureteral catheterization. Upper tract infection in the kidney containing the stone was found in 75.6 per cent of the cases. A total of 94 patients completed treatment with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and were followed for 3 to 16 months (mean followup 6.4 months). A marked correlation between the incidence of residual macroscopic stone fragments and the presence of persistent infection was noted. Of the 51 patients who became free of stones 48 (94 per cent) had sterile urine. Only 3 of the 51 patients had persistent infection in the treated kidney despite complete disappearance of the stones. In 45 of the 59 patients with stones smaller than 2 cm. (76 per cent) the infection was eradicated, whereas of the 35 with larger stones the urine became sterile in only 13 (37 per cent). We conclude that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy can be endorsed for treatment of small infected stones but it is inadequate for treatment of stones larger than 2 cm. unless combined with percutaneous nephrolithotripsy or chemical dissolution of the residual infected fragments.\r"

Prophylactic stenting reduced the incidence of complications and the need for percutaneous nephrostomy tubes to relieve subsequent ureteral obstruction. Internal stenting maintained the sterility of the urinary tract and reduced the average hospital stay by a third. Residual stone fragments representing less than 5 per cent of the original stone mass remained in 56 per cent of the patients, particularly in those with hydronephrotic kidneys. We suggest that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy monotherapy with prophylactic stenting is the preferred treatment for noninfected complete staghorn calculi.\r"

Urine cultures were positive in 30 of 32 patients (94 per cent) before treatment. All patients with positive preextracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy urine cultures also had positive cultures after treatment. Followup (3-month) was available for 26 of 41 renal units (63 per cent) and showed 19 (73 per cent) to be free of stones or without any radiographic evidence of calcification overlying the collecting system. Seven staghorn calculi were treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy without prior debulking procedures. Two partial staghorn calculi were treated and rendered free of stones. None of the 5 kidneys with full staghorn calculi was rendered free of stones. We conclude that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is effective for the treatment of unbranched and partial staghorn calculi in the spinal cord injury patient. However, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy alone is less effective for the treatment of full staghorn calculi.\r"

Although the mean value for obstructed kidneys was not improved at followup, kidneys with a decreased glomerular filtration rate preoperatively improved significantly after pyeloplasty. The maximum concentration ability was low preoperatively for the obstructed kidneys compared to the contralateral kidneys. The lowest maximum concentration ability was found in patients with a history of repeated upper urinary tract infections. At followup marked improvement was noted, which was most obvious for kidneys with severely reduced concentration ability preoperatively. However, the restoration was not total.

Metastasis was present at diagnosis in 11 of the 29 patients, while 18 had metastasis 2 months to 11 years after nephrectomy, with an average interval free of disease of 38 months. There were 13 pulmonary metastases, 6 bone lesions and 10 other lesions. The estimated over-all survival rate for this group was 41 per cent at 2 years and 13 per cent at 5 years after excision of the metastasis. Only 2 of the 29 patients currently are alive with no evidence of disease 42 and 53 months since excision of the metastasis. Neither the presence nor absence of a metastasis at diagnosis nor the interval between nephrectomy and the development of a metastasis in patients without metastatic disease at diagnosis appeared to influence survival after excision of the metastasis. Unlike previous reports, these results suggest that the beneficial effects of excision of metastatic renal cell carcinoma are limited to improved short-term survival postoperatively and that surgical cure of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma is a relatively uncommon event.\r"

All but 1 patient had additional endoscopic maneuvers before treatment, consisting of the passage of a Zeiss sling around the stone in 40 and, when this was not possible, a ureteral stent in 29. The over-all success rate was 94.2 per cent (66 of 70 patients) with 3 patients having retained fragments and 1 requiring an open operation. The combination of new positioning techniques and relatively simple endoscopic maneuvers makes treatment of lower ureteral stones feasible and safe with the Dornier lithotriptor.\r"

Initial applications of the Mainz pouch were for bladder augmentation after subtotal cystectomy and for continent urinary diversion. Current indications have been extended to complete bladder substitution after radical cystoprostatectomy with anastomosis of the pouch to the membranous urethra. For cosmetic reasons the umbilicus is used as a stomal site for continent urinary diversion, and the technique of intussuscepting the continence nipple has been modified accordingly. A total of 100 patients underwent a Mainz pouch procedure since 1983: 34 for bladder augmentation, 15 for total bladder substitution after cystoprostatectomy and 51 for continent urinary diversion. In the bladder augmentation group 1 patient underwent conversion to a continent stoma, 1 has urge and frequency, and the remaining 32 are completely dry day and night. These patients empty the bladder at normal intervals spontaneously except for 3 who rely on intermittent catheterization. In the bladder substitution group 1 patient has grade 1 stress incontinence and the remainder are completely dry during the day. However, at night 4 patients have leakage and they use a condom urinal. In the urinary diversion group all but 2 patients are completely dry and are on intermittent catheterization. The main problem of the initial series was prolapse of the continence nipple, which has been solved by staple fixation of the nipple to the bowel wall and to the ileocecal valve.\r"

The development of microsurgical techniques and free tissue transfers have advanced phallic reconstruction by reducing the number of surgical procedures and by allowing more selectivity in choosing the best innervated donor tissue. During the last 5 years 16 patients underwent total phallic reconstruction using free tissue transfers from distant donor sites. The pudendal nerve was coapted routinely to the major sensory nerves of the donor free flap. The most accurate objective baseline parameters of penile sensibility are pressure and vibratory thresholds, and electrically evoked potentials. We examined 30 normal subjects and 7 patients at least 1 year postoperatively for penile (phallic) sensibility. A pressure aesthesiometer, a biothesiometer and electrodiagnostic studies were used for testing. The 7 postoperative patients (in all of whom the pudendal nerve was incorporated into the reconstruction) had an encouraging return of tactile and erogenous sensibility compared to normal subjects. This is a promising advance in phallic reconstruction.\r"

While the nature of genital human papillomavirus infection in women is well documented, detailed knowledge of the disease in the male partners is lacking. Therefore, a prospective study was done to define the disease in the genitals of heterosexual men and to formulate an appropriate plan of management. We studied 52 men during an 8-month period for evidence of genital human papillomavirus infection. The majority of the lesions occurred on the shaft of the penis and on the foreskin of uncircumcised men. Deoxyribonucleic acid dot hybridization of biopsies of macroscopic warts and suspected warty lesions with mixed human papillomavirus types 6 and/or 11 and 16 and/or 18 probes revealed that 87 and 55 per cent, respectively, were positive for 1 or more of these human papillomavirus types. Of the macroscopic warts and subclinical lesions 52 and 29 per cent, respectively, contained the more potentially oncogenic types 16 and/or 18, either alone or in combination with types 6 and/or 11. There was no evidence of human papillomavirus in any semen or urine sample but human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid sequences were detected in 31 per cent of the biopsies from apparently normal penile skin and in 18 per cent of the urethral mucosal biopsies. We suggest that management of human papillomavirus infection be directed toward prevention and contact screening, together with ablation of localized lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Cost containment need not be imposed on physicians by government, insurance companies and hospital administrators. Decreases in hospital cost can be achieved voluntarily by physicians without sacrificing quality of care, especially for common procedures with relatively homogeneous patient populations, such as transurethral prostatectomy. Variations in existing practice were identified and shared, and optimal scientific practice was discussed at 5 meetings of the division of urology during a 16-month period. Strict guidelines were not developed; surgeons were encouraged to apply cost-related knowledge individually. Resource use was measured before, during and after the intervention. A total of 356 transurethral prostatectomies was studied. There were significant decreases in preoperative and postoperative length of stay, specific ordering practices and total hospital charges. University faculty differed from community urologists and individual surgeons varied considerably. Suggestions for scientific cost management in prostatectomy are presented.\r"

The incidence of bacteriuria after cystoscopy was 2.8 per cent in group 1 (control) and 1.5 per cent in group 2, with an over-all incidence of 2.2 per cent. Only 1 patient presented with a symptomatic infection (0.7 per cent).

Under basal conditions no pelvic pressure increase was observed during detrusor contraction or other alteration of lower urinary tract pressure. However, after the flow in the upper tract was increased by oral water load, intravenous furosemide or direct pelvic perfusion, pelvic pressures were markedly elevated and reflected accurately any change in intravesical pressure. Under such conditions, pelvic pressures frequently exceeded 40 cm. water. These observations provide an explanation for the increasing size of the upper tract and a clarification of the mechanism whereby renal function might gradually deteriorate in these patients.\r"

We confirmed that high pressures during conventional filling cystometry were common in men with upper tract dilatation. However, important differences were demonstrated between long-term monitoring and conventional cystometry. The pressure increase during the natural filling phase of long-term monitoring was significantly smaller than that during conventional cystometry. Detrusor instability was found in 88 per cent of the men during long-term monitoring but in only 51 per cent during conventional cystometry (p less than 0.001). High frequency unstable detrusor contractions during long-term bladder pressure monitoring were associated significantly with upper tract dilatation (p less than 0.0001) and correlated significantly with impairment of glomerular filtration rate (rs equals -0.7339, p less than 0.001).\r"

The advantages of percutaneous nephrostomy in this setting include prompt drainage of the obstructed renal pelvis or ureter, direct access to obtain specimens from the renal pelvis to confirm the diagnosis, direct irrigation of the fungus balls with amphotericin B and an access route for fragmentation of fungus balls by guide wire manipulation. In 3 cases percutaneous placement of the nephrostomy tube was successful in obtaining and maintaining access to the renal pelvis, while in 2 surgical intervention was required because of problems maintaining placement of the percutaneous catheters. Percutaneous nephrostomy with antegrade amphotericin B irrigation, coupled with systemic antifungal therapy, is the mainstay of treatment. The usefulness of ultrasonography in the early diagnosis of renal candidiasis also is emphasized.\r"

Since neither computerized tomography nor ultrasound can exclude an underlying neoplastic process, surgery remains indicated. However, an understanding of the spectrum of diagnostic possibilities can have an impact on planning the most appropriate surgical approach. We conclude that partial nephrectomy, with appropriate intraoperative pathological assessment, may represent a satisfactory renal-sparing therapeutic algorithm for the management of localized cystic disease.\r"

Shock waves generated by a spark plug in a tubless lithotripter administered to stones placed into the renal pelves of dogs, resulted in interstitial renal hemorrhage developing acutely, and interstitial fibroblastic reactions chronically. The latter were linear, and were in the cortex and/or medulla. They resulted from organisation of the interstitial hemorrhages. In addition interstitial nephritis was present and this could be the result of the surgery, the stones, preexisting infection or the ESWL. Other organs were intact, with the exception of a hematoma in the large bowel of one dog. Lithotripsy, in this dog model, produced a spectrum of kidney injury.\r"

The drug-antibody conjugate, prepared from using 25% oxidized dextran as the linker, retained essentially the original immunological activity of the antibody using ELISA as tested against an antigen-positive target cell line (TSGH-8301), which has been shown to express an antigen recognized by the monoclonal antibody 1G3.10. Antitumor effect of the conjugate in vitro was evaluated by its inhibition on 3H-uridine incorporation into the established human bladder cancer cells. The conjugate exhibited a significantly higher cytotoxicity on target TSGH-8301 cells than that by a control antibody-doxorubicin conjugate prepared identically from an irrelevant mouse IgG3 monoclonal antibody. No apparently different cytotoxicity was detected on control antigen-negative bladder tumor cells of J82 between these two drug-antibody conjugates. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, enhanced the in vitro cytotoxicity of doxorubicin-1G3.10 monoclonal antibody conjugate. Results obtained from in vivo evaluation using xenografted target TSGH-8301 bladder tumor indicated that the 1G3.10 monoclonal antibody conjugate containing doxorubicin injected 4X, i.p., significantly inhibited TSGH-8301 bladder tumor growth in nude mice, whereas free monoclonal antibody, free drug and the mixture of both showed only moderate inhibition of tumor growth as compared to the untreated control. Verapamil also enhanced in vivo antitumor activity of the conjugate. There was no side effect (weight loss) detected on the conjugate-treated mice. Results obtained from in vivo evaluation using xenografted control J82 bladder tumor showed no specific antitumor activity as exhibited by doxorubicin-1G3.10 monoclonal antibody conjugate in comparison with free drug, mixture of drug and antibody without conjugation, or doxorubicin conjugated to the irrelevant antibody. These results suggested that doxorubicin conjugated with bladder tumor associated monoclonal antibody could be useful as a potentially cytotoxic agent in immunochemotherapy of human bladder cancer.\r"

The growth factors appear similar in that they are inactivated by boiling and acid, but not by treatment with reducing agent. The growth factor in human and bovine testes was partially purified from tissue homogenates, prepared in high ionic strength buffer (pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors, by ammonium sulfate precipitation and two cycles of heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The growth factor in calf testes was also partially purified from tissue extracted in ammonium sulfate without protease inhibitors, acidified to pH 4.5, and precipitated by ammonium sulfate followed by two cycles of heparin-affinity chromatography. A predominant 17,500 molecular weight (MW) growth factor was identified from alkaline homogenates of human and calf testes by its reactivity with antisera prepared against synthetic peptides whose sequences corresponded to residues 1-12 (amino-terminal), 33-43 (internal) and 136-145 (carboxy-terminal) of bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). A slightly smaller 16,600 MW peptide from acidic extracts of calf testes also reacted with antisera to the three synthetic peptides. A 15,500 MW peptide, lacking immunoreactivity with antiserum to the amino-terminal synthetic peptide, was also seen. These findings suggest that a growth factor is present in human and calf testes that is structurally related to bFGF. The structure of the growth factors appears to be altered during the isolation procedure.\r"

The recovered keratin had the same molecular weight as the input molecules, implying that substances in the urine physically inhibited the assay rather than destroyed the keratin. The independent variables of cell count, dead cells, and protein concentration were not found to be important in evaluating the results. However, the urine concentration, as measured by creatinine, might be an important consideration for assessing the levels of keratin detected.\r"

Functional alterations in the donor artery, occurring after the implantation of the graft, have been considered as having an arresting effect on the progress of the occlusive disease, which explains the favorable long-term results. However, until now, the intrinsic mechanism of this phenomenon has remained unexplained. Little attention has been devoted to the evaluation of the natural history of the donor artery. To achieve this purpose, 18 patients previously operated on for femorofemoral bypass, with a normal patent graft, were submitted to angiographic evaluation, from 8 to 57 months after the operation (mean 22 months). The angiograms were compared with the preoperative films to assess the progress of the occlusive disease in the donor artery. A slight but significant dilatation of the proximal donor arterial segment was documented in every case, affecting the external iliac and common femoral arteries. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon is discussed. It may be related to decreased peripheral resistance and increased blood flow occurring in the donor arterial segment, reported after the implantation of the shunt. This dilatation of the donor artery may have a compensatory effect for local atherosclerotic stenosis, thereby explaining the favorably long duration of the femorofemoral bypasses, which has been emphasized since the early days of extraanatomic revascularization. A similar phenomenon may occur in the vessels of the upper extremity, after axillofemoral revascularization.\r"

Twenty-seven patients had stab wounds and 34 had gunshot wounds, with a relatively equal distribution between the zones of injury. Fifty-seven arteriograms were normal and six were abnormal. Of the six arteriographic defects, three were thought to be spurious on subsequent review, two were clinically insignificant, and one required surgery. No significant arterial injuries were identified by arteriography in the absence of suggestive physical findings. No major arterial injuries were discovered during neck surgery that were missed preoperatively. Neither abnormal nor normal angiograms significantly altered the course of management, including the approach to neck exploration. These data suggest that arteriography for penetrating neck trauma is usually unnecessary for observation of patients in stable condition without suggestive physical findings. Thorough neck exploration with dissection of the carotid sheath in patients with physical diagnostic criteria for surgery eliminates the need for angiography in most cases and avoids the consequences of a possible false-negative study.\r"

Further measurements of APTT from static blood and from circulating arterial blood were made at 3, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after heparinization. Samples taken below the aortic clamp showed measurements of APTT lower than those from circulating arterial blood at 15, 30, and 60 minutes (p less than 0.05 paired Wilcoxon rank sum test).

  ".W": "Secondary vascular procedures to below-knee vessels for lower extremity ischemia present a challenge to the vascular surgeon. Autogenous vein is often unavailable and failure of the previous bypass often limits the choice of distal vessels suitable for revascularization. This dilemma raises the question of amputation vs secondary vascular surgery. To address this question we reviewed the results of our previous aggressive approach to revascularization in a select group of 25 patients (26 limbs) who had secondary procedures with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts to tibial vessels or the infragenicular popliteal artery with single-vessel runoff. Nine of these 26 bypasses (35%) have remained patent for a mean of 17.2 months and no amputations have been done in this group. The other 17 bypasses (65%) have occluded from 1 day to 36 months postoperatively (mean 4.3 months); 15 of these limbs have required major amputation (58%). Ten were performed within the first 3 months postoperatively. Thirteen of the 25 patients died in the follow-up period (mean 27.5 months); five of these patients had viable limbs. Of 12 surviving patients (mean follow-up 19.9 months), six had viable limbs and six have required amputation. These results indicate that patients having secondary vascular surgical procedures with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts to tibial vessels have a high amputation rate and poor overall survival. Within this select group of patients, those who could walk with the aid of a prosthesis should be considered as candidates for primary amputation. This would facilitate rehabilitation and avoid the anguish of recurrent graft failure and multiple procedures.\r"

Sixty-eight infected wounds potentially involving PAPGs were initially treated by excision of necrotic and infected wound tissue in the operating room (wound excision). This was sufficient for all 34 minor infections that did not directly involve the graft. In the 34 remaining infected wounds with graft involvement (major infections), partial removal of a PAPG in 13 cases allowed preservation for up to 15 years of a functioning arterial segment and its collaterals. Ten other grafts were entirely saved. Only 11 of 34 major graft infections ultimately required total graft removal. This approach to infection complicating PAPGs resulted in only two deaths (6%) and directly led to limb loss or amputation at a higher level in eight patients (24%). Total removal of an infected PAPG is often unnecessary and may increase mortality and morbidity.\r"

Operative indications were acute azotemic renal failure (three patients), poorly controlled renovascular hypertension (four patients), and staged repair of bilateral renal artery disease (one patient). All revascularizations were successful in restoring renal function or rendering hypertension manageable and were assessed by means of renal flow scans, celiac angiography, or return of function in those patients with a solitary, functioning kidney. All patients survived the operation with one late death caused by myocardial infarction after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The gastroduodenal artery may be used as the source for arterial inflow in revascularization of the right renal artery by end-to-end anastomosis in approximately 50% of instances, conferring the advantage of the use of only one anastomosis and obviating the long-term possibility of vein graft failure.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of prosthetic aortic graft infection was evaluated in 18 patients with history and findings suggestive of this complication. The prospective interpretation of MRI was compared with surgical findings. Sixteen patients had a graft infection verified at operation. Fourteen patients had infection of the retroperitoneal portion of the graft; two patients had an infection limited to one of the groins; no graft infection was found at surgical exploration in the remaining two patients. Perigraft infection was correctly diagnosed on the basis of MRI findings in 14 of 16 cases; findings were false negative in one case, questionable in another case, and correctly excluded graft infection in two of two cases. MRI also defined the extent of infection in 14 of 16 cases. MRI findings that supported the clinical suspicion of graft infection were perigraft fluid collections remaining more than 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, local inflammation was suggested by an increased signal intensity of adjacent muscle on T2-weighted images in some cases. CT scans were performed in 12 patients; these enabled a correct diagnosis in five and provided indeterminate or false information in seven. These results indicate that MRI is helpful in the diagnosis of aortic graft infection. Furthermore, MRI provides information about the extent of infection crucial for planning therapy.\r"

Extensive clinical, laboratory, psychometric, and functional data were gathered for 102 fatigued patients and 26 controls. Laboratory testing was not useful in detecting unsuspected medical conditions or in determining the cause of fatigue. Depression or somatic anxiety or both were suggested by screening psychometric instruments in 82 fatigued patients (80%) compared with three controls (12%). Global dysfunction was marked, as reported by patients on the Sickness Impact Profile. The mean score on the Sickness Impact Profile of 11.3 for fatigued patients is similar to that reported for patients with major medical illnesses. After one year of follow-up, only 29 fatigued patients (28%) had improved. The high prevalence, persistence, and functional consequences of fatigue mandate a search for effective therapy.\r"

A blinded study of 237 patients who refused testing identified nine (3.8%) additional HIV-infected patients. Men who refused testing were 5.3 times more likely to be infected than men who accepted testing. Male homosexuals and black and Hispanic men who refused testing were 7.3 and 8.8 times, respectively, more likely to be infected with HIV than were their counterparts who accepted testing. Human immunodeficiency virus testing and counseling should be routinely offered to STD clinic patients. Male STD clinic patients, especially homosexual or minority men, who refuse voluntary HIV testing should be counseled regarding reducing their risk for HIV transmission.\r"

To overcome the problem of not being able to detect small but clinically important benefits in mortality in randomized clinical trials of exercise and risk factor rehabilitation after myocardial infarction with small numbers of patients, we carried out a meta-analysis on the combined results of ten randomized clinical trials that included 4347 patients (control, 2145 patients; rehabilitation, 2202 patients). The pooled odds ratios of 0.76 (95% confidence intervals, 0.63 to 0.92) for all-cause death and of 0.75 (95% confidence intervals, 0.62 to 0.93) for cardiovascular death were significantly lower in the rehabilitation group than in the control group, with no significant difference for nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction. These results suggest that, for appropriately selected patients, comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on mortality but not on nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The UMKC plan for medical education offers an alternative pathway for motivated high achievers with early evidence of health care commitment. Essentially, such a program is an honors program for the academically elite. The UMKC plan makes a large, sustained effort to influence attitude. In our descriptive literature and in our curriculum content, we have emphasized that we seek health care talent at the earliest age possible and that we use these formative years to enhance, to influence, and to inculcate the qualities of compassion, sensitivity, honesty, integrity, dependability, and responsibility. The reason for early admission is to influence attitude. We hold to the national standards in terms of science and technology, and all graduates have been required to pass Parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners examinations. The graduate of this program, using performance in the first postgraduate year as a measure, is comparable with the product of the traditional eight-year concept, with a dividend of two extra years of career time. The UMKC program is not for all students; it is not offered as a replacement for the traditional American system. However, a proper distribution of medical admissions spaces should be made that takes advantage of the high level of ability, commitment, and dedication already present in the best of our high school students. A program such as the UMKC plan offers the prospect of educating American physicians, fully prepared technically but especially concerned with the important attitudinal values sought by the American public. Ward Darley, MD, was a consultant and guide during the founding years of this medical school. In his words, \"The UMKC program is aimed at humanizing medicine, lowering the cost per student for education, providing a pool of dedicated physicians educated broadly enough to provide community leadership for future changes in the function and structure of society.\" Dr Darley's anticipation that this six-year program would lower the cost of medical education was always inherent in the simple arithmetic of six years compared with eight. These fiscal savings have been realized by our students and their parents. The additional bonus of two years of medical career is another kind of cost savings. However, the economy of the UMKC program is not the merit by which to judge. Instead, it should be judged on the basis of the opportunity to influence attitude and conduct and to inculcate an unusual quality of caring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Based on data from three studies with complete recording of adverse events in about 12,000 patients each, we determined that angioedema in association with the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril maleate occurred during the first week of therapy at the rate of one case per 3000 patients per week. Thereafter, the incidence was 14-fold lower, without evidence of a temporal trend in incidence beyond the first week of therapy. The cumulative incidence was one case per 1000 patients treated (0.1%). An additional 138 case reports consistent with the diagnosis of angioedema were obtained from our overall controlled and marketed experience using enalapril in more than 1.2 million patients. These reports were examined to further characterize the reaction. The cases generally were mild, and they resolved on discontinuation of drug therapy. Seven patients experienced angioedema or urticaria in association with both enalapril and captopril, a structurally different angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor. This further suggested that the side effect is mechanism based. If angioedema is suspected, therapy with any angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor should be interrupted promptly, respiratory distress should be treated appropriately, and subsequent therapy should be initiated with an agent from an alternative class of medication.\r"

  ".W": "Several modifications of the Fontan principle are currently applied to the treatment of tricuspid atresia with low mortality. The use of these modifications in other malformations has most frequently been associated with less satisfactory results. At our institution, from June 1977 to October 1986, 35 consecutive patients, whose ages ranged from 8 months to 20 years (median age 3.4 years), underwent a modified Fontan procedure. Twenty patients with a median age of 3.2 years (group I) having tricuspid atresia (16 patients) or hypoplastic right heart syndrome (four patients) were treated by means of a right atrium-pulmonary artery anastomosis (12 patients) or right atrium-subpulmonary chamber connection (eight patients). Fifteen patients (group II) with a median age of 3.6 years, having a single left ventricle (10 patients), left atrioventricular valve hypoplasia or atresia (three patients), or double-outlet right ventricle (two patients), underwent right atrium-pulmonary artery anastomosis, together with a repositioning of the atrial septum to the right of the right atrioventricular valve, which thus left intact the inlet to the ventricle(s). The operative mortality rate was 25% in group I and 0% in group II. One patient in group I and one in group II died late postoperatively. All the 28 survivors are free of symptoms 3 months to 9 years after correction. According to our results, low risk can be associated with modified Fontan procedures in the treatment of complex heart malformations other than tricuspid or pulmonary atresia. Preserving the integrity of the entire inlet to the ventricle(s) by repositioning the interatrial septum, as done in group II malformations, might be helpful in improving the quality of the repair.\r"

  ".W": "From 1975 through 1986, 49 patients with asplenia (23 patients) or polysplenia (26 patients) syndromes underwent a modified Fontan operation. All patients had anomalous systemic venous return, and 43 (88%) had anomalous pulmonary venous return. The atrioventricular valve anatomy varied: 36 patients had a common atrial chamber and common atrioventricular valve, eight had mitral valve atresia, and five had severe mitral valve hypoplasia. Redirection of systemic venous return was accomplished by (1) atrial baffle (29 patients), (2) intraatrial conduit (19 patients), and (3) extraatrial conduit (one patient). There were 21 (43%) hospital deaths overall. However, since 1985, six of 22 patients (27%) have died. Increased mortality was seen in patients requiring atrioventricular valve repair or replacement (8/11, 73%) and in patients with asplenia (65%). Lower mortality was seen in patients with polysplenia (24%) and those receiving an intraatrial conduit (26%), although this decrease also represents the more recent experience. We conclude: (1) The Fontan operation for patients with asplenia or polysplenia syndromes has resulted in a significant (although recently declining) mortality; (2) mortality is higher in patients with asplenia; (3) patients with atrioventricular valve insufficiency requiring repair or replacement are at higher risk; and (4) intraatrial conduits seem to offer promise for successfully accomplishing this repair.\r"

  ".W": "Acute liver dysfunction was analyzed in 15 patients who received a modified Fontan operation for single ventricle in nine (atrial isomerism, seven) and tricuspid or mitral atresia in six. Nine patients had elevation of serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels above 1000 U/L during the first week. As an analysis of postoperative liver function during the first week, the highest values of serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and total bilirubin and the lowest prothrombin time were scored from 0 to 4 within each parameter, and totaled to give a liver dysfunction score. The liver dysfunction score was 0 to 2 (no or trivial injury) in five patients, 3 to 5 (mild) in two, and 6 to 11 (moderate or severe) in eight (53.3%). The group operated on for single ventricle had a higher incidence (67%) of a liver dysfunction score of 6 or higher than the other group (33%). A multivariate analysis for the prediction of the liver dysfunction score mainly from early postoperative hemodynamics showed the highest correlation with cardiac index, followed by urine output, systolic arterial pressure, and central venous pressure. One patient required plasmapheresis. Four died early (less than 1 month); three of these had a liver dysfunction score of 6 or higher. Those with scores of 6 or above had higher serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels at 1 month after operation than those with scores less than 5. In three patients (single ventricle), hepatic venous oxygen saturation was monitored and showed a marked decrease to below 20% with subsequent acute liver dysfunction. These results indicate that acute liver dysfunction appears to occur in patients with complex lesions after a modified Fontan operation from possible hepatic hypoperfusion and that low cardiac output may be more crucial than high central venous pressure alone.\r"

Pulmonary and systemic ventricular function was measured by first-pass radionuclide studies in 11 children 7 +/- 3 years (+/- standard deviation) after baffle procedures. For comparison, similar measurements were made in eight patients with isolated congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and in 10 children in a control group. Exercise increased heart rate and cardiac index to similar levels in all three groups. Ventricular volumes were greater than control volumes in both groups with congenital heart disease. Exercise increased pulmonary ventricular ejection fraction in the control and congenitally corrected groups, but not in the surgically corrected group. Systemic ventricular ejection fraction increased during exercise in the control group, but remained unchanged in both transposition groups. These results show that cardiac index during exercise is maintained in patients after baffle procedures for complete transposition of the great arteries. However, pulmonary and systemic ventricular ejection fractions fail to increase with exercise, and ventricular volumes are markedly greater than normal.\r"

Radiotherapy was given by teletherapy in 33 and brachytherapy in all 46 patients. An average tumor dose was 50 Gy with teletherapy and 20 Gy per application with brachytherapy. There were 25 patients who had more than one brachytherapy application. The 5-year actuarial survival rate for 28 patients with stage I or II disease was 12%, with a median of 13 months. This compared with no 5-year survivals and a median survival of 10 months for the 18 patients with stage III or IV disease. Failure at the primary site was seen in 16 (35%) patients. Complete response was seen in 20%, partial response in 76%, and no response in 4%. Treatment was well tolerated. Complications included esophageal stenosis in two patients and tracheoesophageal fistula in one. Teletherapy-brachytherapy combination is an effective treatment in the management of unresectable or inoperable carcinoma of the esophagus.\r"

A malignant course of drug-resistant bigeminy in combination with other rhythm disorders was accepted as indications for surgical intervention. Cryosurgery was the method used most frequently for the ablation of arrhythmogenic myocardium. All 18 patients underwent postoperative electrophysiologic studies and Holter monitoring to determine the efficacy of the operation. Fifteen of the 18 patients were cured of their symptomatic arrhythmia. Thus surgical intervention is an effective method for the treatment of patients with symptomatic, drug-resistant ventricular allorhythmias.\r"

The tumors were histologically classified into tubular, cribriform, and solid subtypes. Three histologic grades were established: grade I, tumors with tubular and cribriform subtypes but without solid subtype; grade II, tumors with tubular and cribriform subtypes in which the solid subtype comprised less than 20% of the area; grade III, tumors in which the solid subtype comprised more than 20% of the area. Three gross infiltrating types were established: type I, entirely intraluminal; type II, predominantly intraluminal; type III, predominantly extraluminal. In most cases histologic grade correlated with gross tumor type; that is, grades, I, II, and III were grossly types I, II, and III, respectively. The tumors infiltrating along the tracheobronchial wall were of the tubular or cribriform subtype, but not of the solid subtype. In two patients who died of distant metastasis, the histologic studies revealed the solid subtype. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the tubular subtype was the most differentiated form and the solid subtype, the most undifferentiated form. The histologic subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the tracheobronchial tree was an important factor in the growth pattern of the tumor and the prognosis.\r"

  ".U": "88287483\r", 
  ".W": "Between January 1973 and February 1986, operations were performed on 120 consecutive patients having usual atrial arrangement (atrial situs solitus), concordant atrioventricular connection, and double-outlet right ventricle. The ages at operation ranged from 1 day to 44 years and the weights from 2.6 to 84 kg. Sixty-three patients had one or more palliative procedures. For those, the hospital mortality rate was 9.5%. Palliation was considered a definitive procedure in 13 patients. Ninety-three patients had a reparative operation, with a 26.9% early mortality rate. In the group who had complete correction, taken as a whole, the surgical outcome was significantly affected by the position of the ventricular septal defect and by the year of operation. The year of operation was the main factor that, by multivariate analysis, correlated significantly with the hospital mortality in those patients having a subaortic defect and spiraling great arteries (p less than 0.05). No difference was found among this group for those patients having the morphologic characteristics of tetralogy of Fallot. The change-over point from the Mustard to the arterial switch procedures was the event with the greatest effect on hospital mortality in patients with a subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (p less than 0.025). Two late deaths have occurred among the 21 patients who had palliative intervention only. Sixty of the 68 survivors with intracardiac repair have been followed up for a period of 2 to 184 months (median 44 months). There were five late deaths (8.3%). Eight patients underwent successful reoperation. All except three of the long-term survivors were in functional class I. Good early and long-term results can be anticipated for the intracardiac repair of double-outlet right ventricle when the ventricular septal defect is subaortic or doubly committed. The arterial switch operation has been demonstrated to be the optimal approach for double-outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect. Results in patients with noncommitted ventricular septal defect have remained poor.\r"

When, according to the multivariate equation, the predicted probability of this ratio being equal to or greater than 1 is 50% or more, consideration may be given to preliminary operations before repair; when the predicted probability is 70% or more, complete repair at that stage may be unwise.\r"

The methods of repair consisted of asymmetric annuloplasty (Kay-Reed method) in 61 patients, De Vega-type annuloplasty in one, plication of redundant leaflet in 15, and closure of cleft or perforation in nine. The single operative death (1.5%) was due to heart block. Follow-up data were available over 373.8 patient-years (average 5.7 years). The four late deaths (6.0%) were due to heart failure in two patients, pneumonia in one, and hepatitis in one.

One of these patients underwent mitral valve replacement 11 years after initial operation. The rate of freedom from reoperation was 86% +/- 10% after 17 years. The rate of freedom from valvuloplasty failure was 80% +/- 6.7% after 5 years, 67% +/- 7.2% after 10 years, and 44% +/- 11.9% after 15 years.\r"

An atriopulmonary anastomosis technique was then performed and the hemodynamic status of the dogs during the first 2 postoperative hours was evaluated. Pathologic study of the lungs disclosed no arterial lesions. From our experimental work, we conclude that the surgical criterion for establishing the indication for this operation should be pulmonary resistance, which is conditioned by the state of the intrapulmonary vessels.

Most of the 11 patients in this group had some other predisposing risk factors, such as obesity, prolonged aortic cross-clamp time, and prolonged respiratory assistance. We suggest that, if a paramedian sternotomy is diagnosed at the primary operation, special closure techniques should be undertaken. Each patient with early dehiscence of a median sternotomy should undergo a computed tomographic examination. If a paramedian sternotomy is proved, simple reclosure is inadvisable. Sternectomy and closure with muscle flaps are then indicated.\r"

We describe our experience with four severely symptomatic children in whom a valved conduit from the left atrium to the left ventricle was successfully used to bypass a hypoplastic systemic atrioventricular valve. A left atrial-left ventricular extracardiac conduit was implanted in these patients with a hypoplastic mitral anulus and an adequate left ventricular chamber. There were no early or late deaths. Postoperative cardiac catheterization performed in all patients 1 month after the operation showed reduced size of the left atrium, a reduction of the left atrial-left ventricular gradient from a mean of 14 mm Hg to a mean of 5 mm Hg, and an increase of the left atrial outlet from a mean diameter of 10.7 mm to 28.7 mm (including the diameter of the native mitral valve plus the internal diameter of the valved conduit). The application of this unconventional operation in children with congenital or acquired stenosis of the systemic atrioventricular valve should be considered when the mitral valve obstruction cannot be relieved by conventional valve repair or replacement. Furthermore, the left atrial-left ventricular conduit does not preclude future alternative surgical options.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary bypass activates and depletes platelets, which may contribute to postoperative bleeding. In addition, activated platelets may be deposited in the coronary vasculature after ischemia and cardioplegia, which may delay recovery of cardiac function and metabolism and may contribute to early bypass graft occlusion. The antiplatelet agent dipyridamole reduces platelet activation and depletion and may decrease postoperative bleeding and transfusion requirements. A prospective randomized trial was conducted in 58 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass operations to compare the effects of oral (19 patients) and intravenous (21 patients) dipyridamole to the results obtained in a control group (18 patients) who received no dipyridamole. Preoperative oral administration of dipyridamole resulted in lower plasma drug concentrations in the early postoperative period than perioperative intravenous administration (p = 0.0001 by analysis of variance). Postoperative arterial platelet counts were highest in the patients receiving intravenous dipyridamole, intermediate in those receiving oral dipyridamole, and lowest in the control group (p = 0.03 by analysis of variance). Postoperative blood loss and blood product transfusions were significantly reduced with both oral and intravenous dipyridamole (p = 0.04 by analysis of variance). Dipyridamole preserved platelets and reduced postoperative bleeding. Intravenous dipyridamole resulted in higher platelet counts than oral dipyridamole and may be required to reduce postoperative bleeding in high-risk patients.\r"

Emphasis is placed on the demographics, medical characteristics, results of laboratory tests, outcome of treatment, and various comparisons of early- and late-onset alcoholism. The frequency of serious medical disorders among these patients was higher than would be expected for the overall population of a similar age. Elderly alcoholics have more abnormal results of commonly used laboratory tests than do younger alcoholics. Our data show that the elderly alcoholic can be successfully treated in a medically oriented inpatient treatment program. The concept of less-intensive treatment for the elderly alcoholic is generally not supported. More-intensive treatment may be necessary for some of these patients because of the high frequency of accompanying major medical and psychiatric problems. Early-onset alcoholism predominated, but we found no major differences between the two groups.\r"

The most common associated psychiatric disorders were tobacco dependence (67%), organic brain syndrome (25%), atypical or mixed organic brain syndrome (19%), and affective disorder (12%). Fourteen percent of patients also had a drug abuse or dependence problem, all using legally prescribed drugs. Psychiatric diagnoses and results of psychologic testing did not differ between early-onset and late-onset alcoholism groups. In a 60-patient cohort studied for correlation of outcome of treatment for alcoholism with major psychiatric diagnoses, no associations were found.\r"

In 14 of the 15 cases, metastatic melanomas were present; 11 were associated with a history of pigmented primary melanoma. The Fontana stain was positive in 4 cases and negative in 11. The S-100 stain was positive in 13 cases and negative in 2. Of the 11 cases with negative Fontana stains, 9 were positive with the S-100 immunostain and 2 were negative. Electron microscopy showed melanosomes in 13 cases. Melanosomes were seen in the two cases with negative Fontana and S-100 staining. Although all stages of melanosomes were identified, generally the majority were immature melanosomes. This study demonstrates the difficulties associated with the histologic diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma. The Fontana stain may be helpful, and the S-100 stain is generally positive. Electron microscopy provided the only evidence for melanoma in two cases and is considered the most definitive method of diagnosis of amelanotic melanomas. These tumors generally produce some pigment and thus are called amelanotic by convention, not because pigmentation is totally absent.\r"

Learning and memory are most susceptible to impairment postoperatively, although general intellectual abilities are also affected in a small number of patients. The data are further analyzed in a manner that permits determination of the probability of cognitive alterations postoperatively for individual patients. Information is provided to assist health-care professionals in evaluating the risk-to-benefit ratio relative to cognitive abilities as they consider this treatment alternative for their patients who suffer from intractable partial complex seizures.\r"

The initial symptom of such fractures is severe pain unassociated with an obvious history of trauma. The typical sites of involvement are the sacrum, the iliac bones, and the pubis. The plain film appearance of the sacral and iliac fractures is usually subtle and easily overlooked, and bone scans will show the abnormal areas more readily. The existence of multiple fractures not only in the pelvis but also in the vertebrae and ribs should suggest the diagnosis of insufficiency-type stress fractures. Computed tomography can exclude the presence of a destructive process and an associated soft tissue mass, as would be seen in metastatic disease. If insufficiency fractures are identified in the typical anatomic locations, bone biopsy is unnecessary.\r"

Only among extremely immature preterm babies born at 26 weeks or less was improvement in fetal survival counteracted by an increase in neonatal mortality. Fewer than 5% of complete fetal to first year deaths occurred postneonatally. After the age of 26 gestational weeks, intrauterine growth retardation was a major unfavourable factor, associated with a 3-fold increase in neonatal mortality.\r"

The median age at presentation for strabismic amblyopia (3.64 years) was significantly lower than for combined strabismus and anisometropia (4.68 years) and anisometropia (6.27 years). Boys presented later than girls, as did Asians compared with Caucasians. Only 38 (15%) of children with a visual defect without strabismus (anisometropia) were identified before the age of 5 years. The major reason for this late identification is the lack of a reliable single test for preschool vision assessment.\r"
