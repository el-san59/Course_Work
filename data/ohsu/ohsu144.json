Using immunohistochemical staining against normal bladder mucosa, mab Mano 4/4 reacts with distinct cells in the basal layer and mab 486 P 3/12 recognizes single cells in the superficial layer. Analysing different transitional-cell carcinomas, mab Mano 4/4 reacts with 17 of 20 and mab 486 P 3/12 with 17 of 19 bladder tumors. It is emphasized that both mabs may add new information in respect to a better characterization of the heterogeneity of bladder carcinoma. A biochemical characterization of the mabs and their corresponding antigens is given. Mab Mano 4/4 is directed against a 28 kD glycoprotein and mab 486 P 3/12 is reacting with a 200 kD glycoprotein belonging to the family of CEA-like proteins.\r"

This is a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) which is immunologically related to the ras oncogene product p21. Sixteen patients with TCC (55%) and none of the controls exhibited high level of p55 expression (greater than or equal to 3X the level of background). There were ten cancer patients (35%) who had 2X the level of background and three patients (10%) who had the level of background. In contrast, there were two non-cancer patients with 2X level of expression (9%) and the remainder (91%) had the background level of p55 expression. The expression of the marker (p55) tends to correlate with tumor grade and stage and is elevated in patients with a history of multiple recurrences. The ras oncogene has been identified in the tissues of a wide variety of cancers and is not a marker which is specific for any single cancer. The identification of its related gene product in the urine may be useful as a marker for TCC.\r"

Prior light microscopy studies have used voided squamous cells, periurethral cells or scraped vaginal cells, which are less representative of the cells lining the majority of the urinary tract. Using a modification of previous bacterial adherence assays, the mean adherence for 28 strains of E. coli in 92 bacteria-cell incubations was 10.2 +/- 11.5 (standard deviation) bacteria per cell. The mean adherence for 20 strains of P. mirabilis in 60 bacteria cell incubations was 8.1 +/- 11.4. No statistically significant difference in adherence between E. coli and P. mirabilis was found (p greater than 0.05). Studies comparing the adherence of E. coli isolated from the urine of patients with pyelonephritis (eight strains), cystitis (10 strains) and anal swabs of females without urinary tract infections (10 strains), showed no statistically significant differences in mean adherence (p greater than 0.05). However, there was a trend toward higher adherence in the more virulent groups. Experiments comparing the adherence of P. mirabilis isolated from infected renal stones to P. mirabilis isolated from anal swabs of female patients without history of P. mirabilis UTI revealed no statistically significant differences in mean adherence between the two groups (p greater than 0.05). These data do not support previous contentions that P. mirabilis adhere poorly to human transitional cells. The absence of a significant difference in adherence among strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis that differ in clinical pathogenicity suggests that factors other than adherence contribute to their virulence.\r"

This study was undertaken to test that tenet in patients with focal carotid territory symptoms. Seventy-two patients having independently interpreted arch and selective carotid arteriography and duplex scanning underwent 78 carotid endarterectomies. Operative specimens were analyzed in all cases and used as the standard in evaluating the accuracy of the preoperative studies. All patients had disease found at the time of operation. The sensitivity of duplex scanning was 99% vs. 91% for arteriography (p = 0.06). In seven cases the scan accurately predicted disease in patients with normal arteriograms and in a single case the scan was read as normal in a patient with a smooth minimally stenotic plaque read as an irregular 30% stenosis on arteriography. The accuracy of duplex scanning was markedly superior to arteriography in detecting intimal surface abnormalities (92% vs. 64%, p less than 0.001) and ulceration (90% vs. 54%, p less than 0.001). There was no difference between duplex scan and arteriography (p = 1.0) in predicting a greater or less than 50% stenosis (accuracy, 94% for arteriogram; 92% for duplex scanning). Of the patients with preoperative potentially reversible symptoms, 97% were free of symptoms at a mean follow-up of 9 months after operation. Eighty-nine percent (17 of 19 patients) of patients with concomitant, ipsilateral, intracranial, or intrathoracic cerebrovascular disease were free of symptoms after carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Forty-two woven PG910/polypropylene prostheses (24 X 4 mm internal diameter) implanted into rabbit infrarenal aortas were harvested after 2 weeks to 12 months. Each explant was photographed and sectioned for light microscopy and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Randomly selected explants underwent either compliance and bursting strength measurements or assays of production of prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolites by luminal surfaces of both regenerated conduits and normal control aortas in response to administered sodium arachidonate. Results showed 100% patency with no aneurysms and 2% stenoses (1 of 42 prostheses). Confluent endothelial-like cellular luminal surfaces covering oriented smooth muscle-like myofibroblasts comprised the inner capsules whose thicknesses stabilized at 1 to 2 months. Only residual polypropylene remained in the prostheses after 2 months. Compliance studies reflected a 0.65 mm (14%) change over a pressure range of 0 to 160 mm Hg. All regenerated prosthesis-tissue complexes had bursting strengths greater than the proximal perianastomotic native aortas, which burst between 600 and 2000 mm Hg. At 1 month the rate of production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha per square millimeter of surface area of experimental segments was normal. Production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha by experimental segments at 3 months had increased fourfold whereas thromboxane B2 (TxB2) production remained unchanged. The 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TxB2 ratio increased from 1 to 4 months. This study demonstrates clinically efficacious morphologic, mechanical, and biochemical characteristics of PG910/polypropylene-elicited vascular prosthesis-tissue complexes.\r"

Fifty subjects were 50 to 59 years old; 33 were 60 to 69 years of age; and 19 were older than 70 years. Forty-five were men and 57 were women. Risk factors included diabetes mellitus (4%), heart disease (9%), hypertension (24%), peripheral vascular disease (20%), and smoking (46%). Disease was found in 11 subjects (10.8%). Of the 204 internal carotid arteries, 13 (6.4%) were abnormal. Two vessels had 20% diameter stenosis; four had stenoses of 20% to 39%; five had stenoses of 40% to 59%; one had a stenosis of 60% to 79%; and one was occluded. Stenoses greater than 40% occurred in 4% of the 50 to 59 years of age group, 6% of the 60 to 69 years of age group, and 11% of the greater than 70 years of age group. Although the prevalence of carotid stenosis was increased in all subjects who had risk factors, only the association with heart disease reached statistical significance. These results indicate that carotid stenosis is present in an appreciable number of asymptomatic subjects over the age of 50 years and suggest that its prevalence is associated with age and other risk factors.\r"

Net vertebral artery flow was calculated by adding flows from the right and left sides. When net vertebral flow was greater than 200 ml/min, 89 of 148 patients (60%) were found to have a significant stenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction) in one or both internal carotid arteries. Conversely, when net flow was less than 200 ml/min, 101 of 135 patients (75%) had normal or only mildly diseased carotid system (p less than 0.001). When compared with otherwise matched groups of asymptomatic patients or patients with lateralizing hemispheric symptoms, those with nonlocalizing symptoms were much more likely to have net flow less than 200 ml/min. For the nonlocalizing symptom group this was 135 of 283 patients (48%) compared with only 72 of 208 asymptomatic patients (35%, p = 0.005) and 110 of 310 patients with hemispheric symptoms (35%, p = 0.003). Duplex sonography appears to offer a noninvasive technique for the functional hemodynamic evaluation of patients with suspected vertebrobasilar insufficiency, with the capability to distinguish those patients whose symptoms may be related to thromboembolic carotid artery disease, true vertebrobasilar ischemia, or some other cause.\r"

Six weeks following entry, surgical patients showed greater dysfunction in the following activities: fluency of speech, getting in and out of bed, sitting down and standing up, toileting, cutting food and pouring beverages, and dressing and undressing. At 4.5 months, surgical patients still exhibited greater dysfunction in toileting, with nonsignificant trends in several other activities. From six months onward, there were no significant differences between the groups. Thus, EC/IC bypass results in transient worsening of functional status beyond the immediate perioperative period.\r"

Compared with clinical breast examination and mammography, the estimated sensitivity of BSE is low (20% to 30%) and is lower among older women. The potential sensitivity of BSE should be higher because women can detect small lumps (0.3 cm) in silicone models. Instruction increases BSE frequency over the short term. Sensitivity also increases, but specificity decreases. The psychological effects of teaching and performing BSE are not yet clear. The cost of screening by BSE is unknown but depends on the accuracy of the test as well as the training method used. Breast self-examination has potential as a screening test for breast cancer, but many questions require scientific examination before this procedure can be advocated as a screening test for breast cancer.\r"

Both compounds show a significant cytoprotective effect on HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cells at concentrations as low as 0.1 microgram/ml (0.3 microM). Both avarone and avarol block in a dose-dependent manner the expression of the p24 and p17 gag proteins of HTLV-III in H9 cells after virus infection and block viral replication, as judged by approximately 80% inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity. These results strongly suggest that these compounds may prove to be useful in the treatment of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.\r"

Similar results were obtained on frozen and fixed tissues. Kidneys from one adult and three fetuses were studied by immunoelectronmicroscopy for antigen localization at the subcellular level using the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The 28 kDa CaBP was present in all kidneys from the eleventh week of gestation. At that stage, all deep parts of collecting ducts were homogeneously stained and a few distal tubules located in the deep cortex were intensely labeled. No labeling was observed in the early stage of nephron differentiation (S-body). 28 kDa CaBP distribution changed with kidney maturation. There was a progressive reduction of the deep part of collecting duct labeling and a concomitant increase in the number and intensity of stained distal tubular cells. At the ultrastructural level, 28 kDa CaBP was observed in the cytosol and the nuclear euchromatin. Our study demonstrates the early cellular synthesis of 28 kDa CaBP and its transient expression by deep collecting duct cells during early fetal life, at a time when only a few distal convoluted tubular cells synthetize it.\r"

This compensation is not interrupted by blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAA) alone with captopril. Since plasma norepinephrine concentration increases after furosemide and alpha 1 adrenoreceptors can mediate enhanced Na+ reabsorption, we administered prazosin (2 mg 6 hr-1) to six normal volunteers consuming a daily intake of 270 mmol of Na+ and 75 mmol of K+, and added captopril (25 mg 6 hr-1) for an additional day to block the RAA system concurrently. Furosemide (40 mg day-1) was given for the last four days. Prazosin given alone before the diuretic reduced (P less than 0.05) BP and plasma angiotensin II (AII) concentration and increased body weight and heart rate. However, when given with furosemide, neither prazosin nor prazosin with captopril modified the short-term natriuretic or kaliuretic responses to furosemide, or the ensuing compensatory reductions in Na+ and K+ excretion. Accordingly, cumulative balances for Na+ and K+ remained neutral over four days of diuretic administration. Neither drug altered the renal responsiveness to the diuretic which was assessed from the relationship between renal Na+ and K+ excretion and diuretic elimination. Although the BP was maintained when furosemide was given alone, when given with prazosin and captopril, the mean BP fell by 13 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most rats (80%) developed a severe proteinuria (greater than 100 mg/24 hr) within two to five days after the injection of anti-GBM IgG. At the same time, microscopic examination of the kidneys revealed a glomerular infiltration by mononuclear phagocytes and a prominent decrease in the intensity of the colloidal iron reaction in glomeruli. A non-proliferative glomerular disease was induced in another group of rats (B rats) by intraperitoneal administration of aminonucleoside of puromycin. A marked proteinuria (greater than 100 mg/24 hr) occurred after six days in 90% of animals. Histochemical studies then revealed a decrease in staining intensity of glomeruli for polyanion. No glomerular hypercellularity was noted. In normal rats and in non-proteinuric A or B rats, the 24 hour urinary excretion of neutral proteinases ranged from 1.4 to 7.8 units (mean value +/- SEM, 4.69 +/- 0.60, N = 11), that of laminin ranged from 100 to 3,900 ng (mean value +/- SEM, 1,154 +/- 325, N = 10), and that of type IV collagen ranged from 160 to 420 ng (mean value +/- SEM, 306 +/- 26.5 ng, N = 8). In proteinuric rats from groups A (N = 11) and B (N = 9), the 24 hour urinary excretion of neutral proteinases significantly increased (mean values +/- SEM, 38.55 +/- 8.66 U for A rats and 42.17 +/- 7.92 U for B rats) and ran parallely with that of proteins, laminin and type IV collagen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Kidney size, GFR and single nephron GFR were higher in poorly controlled diabetic rats than in normal animals. Single nephron GFR rose as a result of an increase in the hydraulic pressure difference across the glomerular capillary wall caused mainly by a rise in the glomerular capillary pressure due to a diminished ratio of afferent to efferent arteriolar hydraulic resistances. Furthermore, the intratubular pressure was reduced as a result of a decrease in hydraulic resistance in the loop of Henle. Strict metabolic control prevented these changes. In conclusion, the increase in renal function in experimental diabetes is determined by the degree of metabolic control excluding a potential nephrotoxic effect of streptozotocin per se.\r"

Control IPK's (perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffered 5% albumin solution containing non-immune globulin) had a renal vascular resistance (RVR) mean +/- SEM 3.10 +/- 0.47 mm Hg/ml/min and a GFR mean +/- SEM 0.63 +/- 0.8 ml/min/g. Anti-GBM antibody administration raised RVR (4.83 +/- 0.52 mm Hg/ml/min, P less than 0.01) and lowered GFR (0.34 +/- 0.04 ml/min/g, P less than 0.01). Perfusate renin activity was higher after antibody administration (684 +/- 87 ng AI/ml/hr compared with control 308 +/- 42 ngAI/ml/hr, P less than 0.01). Treatment with Sar1Ala8All (3 X 10(-6) M) or captopril (10 mg/ml) attenuated antibody-induced vasoconstriction (RVR mm Hg/ml/min, Sara1Ala8All = 3.78 +/- 0.13 captopril = 3.26 +/- 0.12, both P less than 0.05 compared with anti-GBM alone). Both inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) also aggrevated the decline in GFR seen after antibody administration (GFR ml/min/g, Sara1Ala8All = 0.24 +/- 0.05, Captopril = 0.18 +/- 0.03, both P less than 0.05 compared with anti-GBM alone). These IPK studies demonstrate that anti-GBM antibody itself may directly induce intrarenal hemodynamic alterations in the absence of complement activation, neutrophil infiltration, neural influences or circulating vasoactive substances. The results from perfusate renin sampling and blockade of the RAS provide evidence that anti-GBM antibody deposition activates the intrarenal RAS and thereby induces significant hemodynamic alterations.\r"

Fractional excretion (FE beta 2m) was 0.11 +/- 0.03% in six normal subjects and 0.13 +/- 0.05% in nine patients with serum creatinine levels less than 1.6 mg/dl. In five patients with serum creatinine levels above 3.0 mg/dl, FE beta 2m was elevated (range 3.5 to 196%) and serum levels were higher than normal (30,600 +/- 6,910 micrograms/liter vs. 1,268 +/- 111). In seven patients beta 2m levels in 33 proximal cysts (cyst/serum Na greater than 0.8) equalled those in serum (cyst/serum beta 2m 0.98 +/- 0.20), whereas in 21 distal cysts (cyst/serum Na less than 0.4) beta 2m was less than in serum (cyst/serum beta 2m 0.17 +/- 0.07). Analysis of fluid in two patients with polycystic kidney nephrectomy several weeks posttransplant indicated that proximal cyst epithelium is permeable to beta 2m, but less so than to creatinine or urea. These studies show that proximal cysts cannot develop or maintain gradients for beta 2m, whereas distal cysts maintain low levels of the protein despite end-stage renal failure. The normal FE beta 2m values in nonazotemic autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients and the low distal cyst levels of beta 2m in end-stage kidneys indicate that the cystic proximal nephrons do not contribute appreciably to the final urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the histotopography of the renal medulla of the rat in terms of cycles and separations. Cycles are pathways by which solute leaving the medulla in an ascending structure (AVR, AHL) is returned to a deeper medullary level. Separations are based on spatial incontiguity and special characteristics of the interstitium and blood supply. The two concepts are complementary: the compartmentalization resulting from separations imparts specificity to the cycles. Structural lateral heterogeneity, consisting in distinct domains organized around vascular bundles, is present in one form or another in all three medullary zones. Such compartmentalization probably leads to heterogeneity in interstitial solute concentrations, a state of affairs inconsistent with the requirements of a \"central core\". In all such considerations of exchanges between compartments, the lack of a unitary interstitium must be borne in mind. Instead, three general types of interstitium may be distinguished: corresponding roughly to those of the OS and VB, the interbundle region of the IS, and the IM. Among the histotopographic features of the renal medulla not usually included in models of the urinary concentrating mechanism but likely to have functional significance are the association of CD with completely distinct populations of AVR and AHL in the OM and IM; a clear-cut separation throughout the medulla between cycles involving long loops and those involving short loops; the lack of an effective countercurrent association between ascending and descending limbs of short loops in the IS; and a pronounced separation of the venous drainage of the IM from that of the OM.\r"

  ".W": "The explanation for the necessity to have both short and long loop nephrons for urinary concentration is unknown but may represent nature's resolution of conflicting ideal conditions for maximum urinary concentration. Ideally, one would like the thick ascending limb to extend throughout the entire medulla to the papillary tip and be supplied by a blood flow vigorous enough to provide oxygen and remove waste products as rapidly as needed. One would also like to have a progressively smaller volume of tissue to be concentrated toward the papillary tip to lessen the osmotic work required and a highly efficient vascular exchange system to sequester the medullary interstitial solute effectively. But the same efficiency of countercurrent exchange of oxygen causes the inner medulla to have a relatively low oxygen content. The presence of the thin loops of Henle in the inner medulla may represent a compromise between these conflicting ideals. The papilla tapers to a low mass, which allows a mechanism requiring only a modest energy supply to increase the tonicity of the interstitium enormously. The reduced work requirement obivates the need for thick ascending limbs to extend into the papilla where they would be highly vulnerable to anoxia. The outer medulla with its larger mass and thick ascending limbs supplied by a high blood flow can initiate the operation to reduce the volume of fluid and solute to be concentrated, and at the same time carry out other functions required of the filtration-reabsorption kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The main function of the cortical collecting tubule is to raise the fractional solute contribution and absolute concentration of urea in fluid that it delivers to the outer medullary collecting duct. The function of the outer medullary collecting duct is to raise further the absolute intraluminal urea concentration. Finally, the inner medullary collecting duct has two major functions in urinary concentration: first, it adds net urea to the papillary interstitium, and second, it allows the generation of maximally concentrated urine due to osmotic water equilibration. Indeed, the urine osmolality can rise to levels higher than the papillary interstitial osmolality as a consequence of inequalities of the reflection coefficients of urea and sodium chloride.\r"

  ".W": "Like other regional circulations, the medullary circulation supplies oxygen and other primary substrates to the medulla and removes carbon dioxide and other waste metabolites. It also acts as a countercurrent exchanger and simultaneously removes water reabsorbed from the renal tubule to preserve mass balance. Our present understanding of how the medulla serves both these functions at the same time is illustrated in Figure 3. Blood leaves the efferent arteriole with an elevated plasma protein concentration as a consequence of glomerular filtration, and flows down descending vasa recta within a vascular bundle. The increased interstitial osmotic-concentration coupled with a finite capillary reflection coefficient for small solutes causes additional water to be extracted so that at the termination of descending vasa recta, the plasma protein concentration exceeds that in the systemic circulation by approximately twofold. Solute, urea more than sodium chloride, also enters descending vasa recta. As blood flows through the interconnecting capillary plexus and up ascending vasa recta, transcapillary oncotic and osmotic pressure differences combine to cause capillary uptake of fluid. There is also simultaneous loss of urea such that the medullary trapping of urea is very effective. Countercurrent exchange of sodium chloride, however, appears to be less efficient and as a consequence, not only water but sodium chloride is removed from the medulla. Antidiuretic hormone reduces medullary blood flow, both directly by its vasoconstrictor (V1-receptor mediated) effect and indirectly by its antidiuretic (V2-receptor mediated) effects. Prostaglandins are able to enhance medullary blood flow by counteracting vasoconstrictive influences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this study we evaluated the short-term hormonal effects of segmental and whole pancreatic allotransplantation on the glucose intolerance produced by hemipancreatectomy in the primate. In hemipancreatectomized animals without grafts the K-values were reduced to 0.6 +/- 0.05, plasma insulin increased from 27.5 +/- 2.5 to 63.5 +/- 6.3 microU/ml, and glucagon levels declined from 252 +/- 29.9 to 216.5 +/- 33.0 pg/ml. Hemipancreatectomized segmental allograft recipients rendered K-values of 0.79 +/- 0.05, plasma insulin increased from 19.98 +/- 3.43 to 66.0 +/- 17.03 microU/ml, and glucagon release declined from 395.6 +/- 63.0 to 226.2 +/- 37.6 pg/ml during IVGTT postoperatively. Hemipancreatectomized, pancreaticoduodenal allograft recipients rendered K-values of 0.82 +/- 0.1, results not significantly different from hemipancreatectomized or segmental allograft recipients. Plasma insulin increased from 29.5 +/- 4.0 to 186.0 +/- 25.0 microU/ml, and glucagon release declined from 1,087.0 +/- 31.6 to 656.0 +/- 12.7 pg/ml. In summary, segmental pancreatic allotransplantation could not, in the short-term, restore the reduced K-values and hypoinsulinaemia in hemipancreatectomized primates to that of normal, unstressed controls. Although K-values of hemipancreatectomized recipients were not significantly improved, whole pancreas transplantation resulted in improved insulin release and hyperglucagonaemia during IVGTT when compared to segmental allograft recipients. The unexpected findings of hypoinsulinaemia and hyperglucagonaemia in both transplant groups may only reflect a function of the stressed state of the animals in the immediate postoperative phase.\r"

  ".W": "This randomized, double-blind study was designed to evaluate the effect of prostacyclin (epoprostenol) on the incidence and severity of postoperative neuropsychologic dysfunction in patients undergoing coronary artery operation. Four days before operation and 1 week after operation, 100 patients having coronary artery bypass grafting underwent detailed neurologic and psychologic examinations and computed tomographic scans of the brain. The psychologic examination was repeated 2 months after operation. During cardiopulmonary bypass, all patients received 300 U/kg of heparin and then either buffer-diluent or prostacyclin (12.5 ng/kg/min from the time of heparinization until onset of cardiopulmonary bypass and 25 ng/kg/min during cardiopulmonary bypass). No deaths or major neurologic complications occurred in this series. Ninety-six patients completed the psychologic and neurologic evaluations 1 week after operation; 74 of these patients were evaluated psychologically 2 months after operation. Psychologic testing demonstrated similar declines in postoperative performance in both the prostacyclin-treated and the control groups; these changes were no longer present in either group 2 months after operation. Results of neurologic examinations and computed tomographic scans of the brain were unchanged. We conclude that the administration of prostacyclin during cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing routine coronary artery operation has no effect on perioperative cognitive changes.\r"

  ".U": "87171522\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we found that in healthy subjects, 5 and 10 g of a partially purified amylase inhibitor delayed and decreased starch digestion and reduced postprandial plasma glucose after a starch meal but produced diarrhea in two of six and four of six subjects, respectively. Thus, we wondered whether lower doses of the inhibitor, when given with a meal that contained protein and fat as well as carbohydrate, would have the same effect on carbohydrate tolerance without causing diarrhea. Eight healthy subjects were randomized to receive 2.0 or 2.9 g of the inhibitor with a 650-calorie meal that contained carbohydrate, fat, and protein. In comparison with a placebo, ingestion of 2.9 g, but not 2.0 g, of the inhibitor significantly reduced postprandial increases in plasma glucose (P less than 0.05), C peptide (P less than 0.03), and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (P less than 0.008). Similarly, 2.9 g of the inhibitor in comparison with 2.0 g was associated with more carbohydrate malabsorption and more breath hydrogen excretion. Because the carbohydrate malabsorption observed with the 2.9-g dose was similar to that with the previously tested 5- and 10-g doses of the inhibitor but diarrhea was less frequent, impurities in the partially purified preparation may, in part, have been responsible for these adverse effects. We conclude that 2.9 g of the amylase inhibitor given with a meal that contains a mixture of nutrients is effective in increasing carbohydrate tolerance without causing diarrhea. Therefore, this dose is appropriate for use in studies to determine whether the inhibitor has a beneficial effect in patients with diabetes mellitus or obesity.\r"

In swimmers, shoulder pain is the most common musculoskeletal complaint and is usually due to supraspinatus or biceps tendinitis. Glenohumeral instability (often multidirectional) can also be a cause of shoulder pain in swimmers and may be more common than has been reported. Surgical treatment is seldom indicated. Physical therapy modalities and training modifications are the mainstay of treatment. Medial knee pain in breaststroke swimmers and extensor tendon inflammation over the dorsum of the foot are less common injuries and respond to conservative therapy. These overuse syndromes are best prevented by proper training schedules, strength training, flexibility exercises, and avoidance of errors in stroke technique. The rehabilitation program for a competitive swimmer should be chosen with an understanding of the goals of the swimmer and the cooperation of the coach.\r"

Eosinophil granule proteins may be involved in the development of these lesions. This multi-centre study investigated whether these proteins could be demonstrated within the cardiac tissues of eighteen patients with eosinophilic endomyocardial disease. Serial sections of tissue taken at necropsy or at cardiac biopsy were stained for eosinophil major basic protein by indirect immunofluorescence and for eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil protein-X, and activated eosinophils by means of alkaline-phosphatase-linked monoclonal antibodies. Activated eosinophils and secreted eosinophil granule proteins were most evident within the necrotic and later stage thrombotic lesions and were found mainly within the areas of acute tissue damage in the endocardium and in the walls of small blood vessels. These findings suggest that eosinophil granule proteins are involved in cardiac injury, producing muscle damage and vascular injury which lead to the development of endomyocardial fibrosis.\r"

Self-reported changes in alcohol consumption (mean [SEM] from 452 [30] ml ethanol/week during normal drinking to 64 [8] ml/week while drinking the low-alcohol beer) were confirmed by biochemical measurements. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower during the last 2 weeks of the low-alcohol period than during the normal-alcohol period, the mean difference in the supine readings being 5.0 (1.4) and 3.0 (0.9) mm Hg, respectively. Regression analysis suggested that reduction in alcohol intake contributed to the fall in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures independently of changes in weight. Thus, curtailing alcohol intake may lead to improved blood-pressure control and may reduce the need for antihypertensive drugs.\r"

In contrast to previous observations in quinine-treated adults, in whom hypoglycaemia was associated with hyperinsulinaemia, plasma concentrations of insulin were appropriately low and plasma ketones were high. Raised plasma concentrations of lactate and alanine suggested impairment of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

The concentration of GST was significantly increased after anaesthesia in patients who received halothane in 30% oxygen/70% nitrous oxide (n = 37) and in patients who received halothane in 100% oxygen (n = 17). The frequency of abnormal GST concentrations, defined as 4 micrograms/l or more, was 35% and 24%, respectively. GST concentrations usually reached a peak 3-6 h after the end of anaesthesia. In 17 patients who received isoflurane in 30% oxygen/70% nitrous oxide, there was no significant rise in GST concentration and no patient had a concentration above 4 micrograms/l. No patient in any of the groups had a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase. In clinically identical situations, anaesthesia with halothane but not isoflurane leads to demonstrable impairment of hepatocellular integrity.\r"

  ".W": "To study the importance of transferred immunity against cytomegalovirus (CMV) in allogeneic, HLA-matched, T-cell-depleted bone-marrow transplantation, the incidence, severity, and outcome of CMV infections were studied in 40 CMV-seropositive recipients in relation to the donors' immunity against CMV. There was no significant difference in the incidence of CMV infections between recipients of seropositive (n = 27) and seronegative (n = 13) marrow. However, the incidence of CMV pneumonitis (8/13 compared with 4/27; p less than 0.001) and the mortality attributable to CMV infection (6/13 compared with 1/27, p less than 0.01) were significantly greater in the group with seronegative donors than in those with seropositive donors. Multivariate regression analysis showed that recipients of seronegative marrow had a fifteen-fold greater risk of CMV pneumonitis and a fifty-fold increase in risk of a fatal CMV infection than recipients of seropositive marrow. Thus, after T-cell depletion CMV-seropositive marrow protects seropositive recipients against severe CMV infections; whenever possible, therefore, such recipients should be given marrow from seropositive donors. Ultimately, active immunisation of CMV-seronegative donors might help to protect seropositive recipients of T-cell-depleted marrow transplants against severe CMV infections.\r"

The 4-year actuarial probability of leukaemia-free survival was 45% (95% confidence interval 36-54%) for transplants in first remission compared with 22% (15-29%) for those in second remission (p less than 0.0002). The 4-year probabilities of relapse were 26% (14-38%) and 56% (45-67%) respectively (p less than 0.0001). For high-risk ALL, transplantation in first remission had clearly superior results to transplantation in second remission. Further studies are needed to determine whether patients with high-risk ALL should receive transplants during first remission or should initially receive chemotherapy, with transplantation being reserved for patients who relapse.\r"

On reassessment after a few hours 20 children in the prednisolone group were fit for discharge compared with only 2 in the placebo group. There were no early reattendances. Children remaining in hospital had a shorter median duration of stay and were less likely to require further steroid therapy if they had initially received prednisolone.

The control group (365 patients) received their study centres' usual therapy; the heparin group (363 patients) also received subcutaneous calcium heparin (12,500 IU daily). Mean (SD) follow-up was 708 (265) days in the heparin group and 687 (251) in the control group. The reinfarction rate was 63% lower in the heparin than in the control group (4/303, 1.32% v 13/365, 3.56%). The difference in cumulative reinfarction rate between the groups was significant by both drug-efficacy (chi 2 = 3.99, p less than 0.05) and intention-to-treat analysis (chi 2 = 3.84, p = 0.05). Heparin treatment reduced the cumulative general mortality rates by 48% on drug-efficacy analysis (chi 2 = 3.88, p less than 0.05) and by 34% on intention-to-treat analysis (chi 2 = 2.05, not significant). Cardiovascular mortality was also reduced (33%) but not significantly. However, fatal events attributable to thromboembolism (fatal reinfarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism) were significantly less frequent in the heparin than in the control group (1 v 7, p less than 0.05). 60 patients (16.5%) discontinued heparin treatment, but only 23 patients (6.3%) stopped because of side-effects. Low-dose heparin appears to be effective, safe, well tolerated, and free from haemorrhagic risk for the prevention of myocardial reinfarction.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between donor and recipient status for HLA class I and II antigens in 62 patients undergoing liver transplantation was examined with particular reference to a well-defined variant of chronic rejection, the vanishing-bileduct (VBD) syndrome. A complete mismatch for class I antigens was more common in those with the VBD syndrome than in those with normal graft function or chronic graft malfunction unrelated to the syndrome (p less than 0.025). In contrast, a complete mismatch for class II antigens was considerably less common in those with the VBD syndrome than in those without (p less than 0.02). The association of a complete mismatch for class I and a partial or complete match for class II antigens with the VBD syndrome was highly significant (p less than 0.0005). These findings support the hypothesis that in the VBD syndrome both class I antigen expression on bileduct epithelium and immunological interaction at the level of class II antigens are required for the rejection process to occur. In addition, high-titre donor-specific antibodies to class I antigen, which were present in 6 of 14 of those with the VBD syndrome but in none of those without (p less than 0.0005), may be involved in the pathogenesis of bileduct damage.\r"

In 3 patients the fits were associated with postoperative metabolic encephalopathy and fatal progressive neurological deterioration. In some patients the evidence implicating cyclosporin in the development of fits is strong. In others factors such as electrolyte disturbances, steroid treatment for graft rejection, and cerebral infarction may have contributed to the development of the fits. Phenytoin controlled the fits in 10 out of 13 patients. Other neurological complications included 1 case of central pontine myelinolysis, 1 of cerebral abscess, and 4 of non-encephalopathic psychosis.\r"

The cause of pulsatile tinnitus may be found on otoscopic examination. Audiologic assessment and enhanced computed tomography often contribute to the diagnosis. Increased intracranial pressure should be excluded with a fundoscopic examination. Arteriography is required to diagnose life-threatening and treatable lesions in the presence of normal otoscopy, audiologic assessment, and enhanced computed tomography.\r"

  ".W": "It is often suggested that tumors will respond to induction chemotherapy and result in improved survival for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Two regimens of induction chemotherapy were studied in separate randomized, prospective trials over the last 6 years. Eighty-three patients with advanced disease were entered into the first study (43/chemotherapy; 40/control), and 60 into the second (27/chemotherapy; 33/control). Patient randomization was stratified by stage (III/IV) and site (oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, paranasal sinuses). The first study utilized bleomycin, Cytoxan, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in two cycles (one cycle if no tumor response), followed by standard treatment which consisted of combined irradiation and surgery or, in some instances, primary irradiation alone. The second study utilized cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in three cycles prior to standard treatment. An objective tumor response to chemotherapy was observed in 68% in the first study and 85% in the second. The patient survival in both studies (at 24 months in the first; at 19 in the second) was better in the control than that in the experimental groups (43% to 31%; 69% to 46%). In the second study, the average length of delay of standard treatment was longer than in the first study (95 days vs. 66 days; P less than .02). Results combining the P-values of both studies indicate that the relative risk of having persistent disease was 2.9 times greater for patients who received chemotherapy. While toxicity to chemotherapy was not a factor in survival, the number of patients who withdrew from the studies and those who did not comply with treatment were greater in the chemotherapy groups. Except for new drug regimens of exceptional promise, it is recommended that future studies be designed so that chemotherapy is given concurrent with, or following the completion of standard treatment.\r"

This is illustrated in the tympanic membrane, middle ear mucosa, and cholesteatoma. Immunotechnology applied to the temporal bone is shown with an animal-ototoxicity model. Antibodies to keratin and vimentin (i.e., to proteins of the fibrillar components that make up the cytoskeleton) stain specific tissue compartments. Langerhans' cell and T-lymphocyte subsets predominate in a cholesteatoma. The normal human tympanic membrane is devoid of these cells. Gentamicin can be traced with a polyvalent anti-gentamicin antiserum in serial sections of the cochlea and kidney. The drug accumulates in the outer hair cells and proximal tubular cells, respectively. A new technique of CT-scanning, microslicing, plastic embedding, and semithin sectioning of undecalcified human temporal bone is described. Perspectives in applying immunotechnology to this method of human temporal bone processing are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in situ with an underlying spindle cell nodule (pseudosarcoma) was immunohistochemically labeled with antibodies to tissue-specific intermediate filament proteins, including desmin, vimentin, and cytokeratin. Two distinct populations of cells were found within the lesion: cytokeratin-positive cells, corresponding to the carcinomatous component of the tumor, and vimentin-positive spindle cells in the subepithelial nodule. In view of the strict specificity of antivimentin and anticytokeratin for cells of mesenchymal and epithelial origin, respectively, it is proposed that the two components of the pseudosarcoma in our case are not morphologic variants of the same tumor, and that the subepithelial nodule represents a mesenchymal lesion. These results can, however, not be extrapolated to other cases since in some the spindle cell component may represent metaplastic epithelial cells. In view of the difficulties encountered in reaching a correct diagnosis in these lesions, it is recommended to use intermediate filament typing to elucidate the nature of the spindle cells in this controversial tumor.\r"

If questions involve the amount and rate of deterioration, then the test items should generate interval data and show evidence that they reflect change in the disease itself. Second, the reliability of the test items should be carefully determined. Are the variances due to testing errors such as inconsistent positioning or changes in verbal instructions; or do they reflect human performance variation? Third, the test items must be sensitive to small changes, and one must be able to test the very strong as well as the severely debilitated patient. The TQNE was designed to measure degree of disease progression in ALS. The major portion of the protocol consists of isometric force measurement using an electronic strain gauge. Other quantitative segments include tests of pulmonary function, speech rates, and timed activities. Using z-score transformations, we have summarized these test items into five megascores: pulmonary function, bulbar function, timed hand activities, arm strength, and leg strength. Megascores have been used to characterize the natural history of the disease and to judge therapeutic efficacy. Quantitative methods to measure deficit in neuromuscular disease lag far behind other technologic advances in medical research. Future advances in the measurement of neuromuscular deficit depend on the commitment of researchers to invest the time and resources necessary to develop more sensitive and reliable testing techniques.\r"

Because of this possibility, a controlled trial of the calcium channel blocking agent nifedipine was undertaken. One hundred and five patients were randomized and treated in a double-blind manner for 18 months. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability, cardiopulmonary changes, and laboratory data were monitored. The dose of nifedipine was 0.75-1 mg/kg/day in the first 6 months and 1.5-2 mg/kg/day for the next 12 months. Satisfactory blood levels of nifedipine were attained. The study had a power greater than 0.99 to detect a slowing of the illness to 25% of its original rate of progression. No significant improvement was demonstrated in the treated group. One or more of the frequent mild side effects of flushing, dizziness, and leg edema, often associated with the use of nifedipine in adults, occurred transiently in approximately one-half of the patients in the nifedipine group and in 21% of the placebo group. Four patients died, two on nifedipine and two on placebo. This study demonstrates that nifedipine is safe to administer in children, but that it is without beneficial effect on the course of DMD.\r"

The mutation itself should soon be identified at the DNA level, which will permit a detailed analysis of the molecular defect at the biochemical level. Rapid progress has also been made in the study of myotonic dystrophy on chromosome 19. DNA markers closely linked to the mutant locus have been identified, making antenatal diagnosis possible in informative families. Autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies are more difficult to study, but the means to localize even these mutations is being developed. The next decade should prove to be an exciting one for those involved in the molecular analysis and clinical management of human muscular dystrophies.\r"

Evidence for effective therapy has only recently been provided by randomized or controlled trials. In the Guillain-Barre syndrome such evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents. However, when used early in the course, plasma exchange (PE) has been shown to lessen the severity and shorten the duration of the disease; it is indicated only in severely paralyzed patients or those whose rapid deterioration suggests the imminent need for ventilatory support. Some patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) respond to corticosteroid therapy or other immunosuppressive agents. PE is also effective in certain patients, but there is no sound evidence to date concerning combined immunosuppression and PE. The rationale of PE in these conditions and whether it is the removal of a toxic factor or the replacement fluid used that is beneficial remains to be clarified.\r"

Various criteria have to be met in order to accept humoral factors as potential pathogens. In this review these general criteria are discussed, including the evidence provided by plasma exchange therapy, demonstration of circulating or deposited autoantibodies and immune complexes, identification of antigenic molecules, animal model diseases, passive transfer experiments, and the demonstration of circulating factors not directed against specific targets. In acute, chronic, and chronic relapsing inflammatory polyneuropathies, and in the polyneuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy, humoral factors have been identified, but their exact pathogenic role is not fully understood. In the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, a disorder of the motor nerve terminal, pathogenic IgG-antibodies have been demonstrated by passive transfer experiments. In the experimental animal model disorders, the acute and chronic variants of experimental allergic neuritis, humoral factors including antibodies to myelin basic proteins and galactocerebroside and nonspecific humoral factors may all contribute to the ultimate peripheral nerve damage, but their relative importance in relation to cell-mediated immune reactions is not yet clear.\r"

To identify the responsible virus and the consequences of the epidemic, during 1985 we interviewed and serologically screened 597 veterans who had been in the army in 1942. These subjects were selected from three groups. Group I consisted of patients who had received the implicated vaccine and had jaundice; Group II had received the implicated vaccine but remained well; Group III had received a new, serum-free vaccine, with no subsequent jaundice. Ninety-seven percent of Group I, 76 percent of Group II, and 13 percent of Group III were positive for antibodies to hepatitis B virus. Only one subject had hepatitis B surface antigen, for a carrier rate of 0.26 percent among recipients of the implicated vaccine. The prevalence of hepatitis A antibody was similar in all three groups, and no subject had antibody to hepatitis delta virus. We conclude that hepatitis B caused the outbreak, that about 330,000 persons may have been infected, that the hepatitis B virus carrier state was a rare consequence, and that the outbreak induced hepatitis B antibodies that appear to persist for life.\r"

At the end of the study, creatinine clearance was higher in the cysteamine group than in the control group (38.5 vs. 29.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95 percent confidence limits on the difference, 1.8 and 15.8), even though the cysteamine group was on average 1.4 years older than the control group. Cysteamine also improved growth; those in the cysteamine group between two and three years of age grew at 93 percent of the normal velocity, as compared with 54 percent in the control group. Fourteen percent of the patients could not tolerate the taste and smell of cysteamine. Concurrent controls treated in a blinded fashion with a placebo were not included in this study. With this limitation in mind, we conclude that oral cysteamine, by depleting cells of cystine, helps maintain renal glomerular function, improves growth, and constitutes the current treatment of choice for nephropathic cystinosis.\r"

Patients were entered in the study from June 1, 1976, to June 30, 1982. Among those assigned to surgery who received bypass grafts, operative mortality was 4.1 percent. Arteriography performed after one year of follow-up revealed that 74.8 percent of the grafts studied were patent. The cumulative rate of crossover from medical to surgical therapy after two years was 34 percent; the operative mortality among patients crossed over was 10.3 percent. Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 11.7 percent of the patients treated surgically and 12.2 percent of those treated medically (no significant difference). Most of the nonfatal myocardial infarctions in the surgical group occurred in the perioperative period. Overall, the two-year survival rate computed by life-table analysis did not differ between the two groups. However, the curves reflecting mortality as a function of left ventricular ejection fraction were significantly different (P = 0.03); surgery was associated with a significantly reduced mortality among patients with lower ejection fractions. We conclude that patients with unstable angina pectoris have a similar outcome after two years whether they receive medical therapy alone or coronary bypass surgery plus medical therapy. However, patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions may have a better two-year survival rate after coronary bypass surgery.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of the outcome of marrow transplantation in patients with advanced thalassemia, 40 patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia who were 8 to 15 years of age (median, 10) received HLA-identical allogeneic marrow after treatment with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Twenty-eight of the 40 patients were alive and free of disease 260 to 939 days after transplantation, and 2 patients were alive with thalassemia 372 and 1133 days after transplantation. The actuarial probabilities of survival and of disease-free survival at two years were 75 percent and 69 percent, respectively. Ten patients (25 percent) died. Three died of cardiac failure, interstitial pneumonitis, or septicemia within 14 days of transplantation. Three died of infectious complications associated with acute graft-versus-host disease at 46 to 97 days, and two died of infectious complications of chronic graft-versus-host disease at 249 and 290 days. Two patients had transplant rejection and died with marrow aplasia 115 and 192 days after transplantation. One patient had rejection after four months and while the marrow was aplastic underwent a successful second transplantation; the patient was alive without thalassemia 624 days after the first transplantation. The actuarial probability of grade 2 or higher acute graft-versus-host disease in the 32 patients with initial sustained engraftment was 35 percent. Three patients had chronic graft-versus-host disease, which was fatal in two and still active on day 710 in the third. We conclude that bone marrow transplantation can potentially save patients with advanced thalassemia from an otherwise inexorable progression to death from the complications of blood transfusions. The ultimate outcome in this group of patients must await a longer follow-up.\r"

They possess a number of unusual cytological and molecular characteristics. Their nuclear division is considered to be primitive, they have no mitochondria, their ribosomes and ribosomal RNAs are reported to be of prokaryotic size and their large ribosomal subunit contains no 5.8S rRNA. The uniqueness of the microsporidia may reflect their phylogenetic position, because comparative sequence analysis shows that the small subunit rRNA of the microsporidium Vairimorpha necatrix is more unlike those of other eukaryotes than any known eukaryote 18S rRNA sequence. We conclude that the lineage leading to microsporidia branched very early from that leading to other eukaryotes.\r"

  ".W": "Yeast strains with mutations in the genes for DNA topoisomerases I and II have been identified previously in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The topoisomerase II mutants (top2) are conditional-lethal temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants. They are defective in the termination of DNA replication and the segregation of daughter chromosomes, but otherwise appear to replicate and transcribe DNA normally. Topoisomerase I mutants (top1), including strains with null mutations are viable and exhibit no obvious growth defects, demonstrating that DNA topoisomerase I is not essential for viability in yeast. In contrast to the single mutants, top1 top2 ts double mutants from both Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae grow poorly at the permissive temperature and stop growth rapidly at the non-permissive temperature. Here we report that DNA and ribosomal RNA synthesis are drastically inhibited in an S. cerevisiae top1 top2 ts double mutant at the restrictive temperature, but that the rate of poly(A)+ RNA synthesis is reduced only about threefold and transfer DNA synthesis remains relatively normal. The results suggest that DNA replication and at least ribosomal RNA synthesis require an active topoisomerase, presumably to act as a swivel to relieve torsional stress, and that either topoisomerase can perform the required function (except in termination of DNA replication where topoisomerase II is required).\r"

Repeated application of such stimuli produces a progressive enhancement of synaptic efficacy leading to the genesis of spontaneous and stimulation-evoked epileptiform discharges. We have used this in vitro approach to explore the cellular mechanisms which underlie the kindling model of epilepsy. Kindling of the stratum radiatum fibre pathway in vitro induced a progressive, long-lasting reduction of both spontaneous and stimulation-evoked GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps). The reduction of i.p.s.ps by kindling was associated with a profound decrease in the sensitivity of CA1 pyramidal neurons to ionophoretically applied GABA and an increase in sensitivity to NMDA. The reduction of i.p.s.ps and GABA sensitivity was prevented by kindling in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV). These results demonstrate that kindling-like stimulus patterns produce a reduction of GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus resulting from a stimulus-induced postsynaptic activation of NMDA receptors. The modulation of GABAergic inhibition by NMDA receptors may cause the synaptic plasticity which underlies the kindling model of epilepsy.\r"

  ".U": "87173062\r", 
  ".W": "In the mammalian central nervous system, receptors for the excitatory amino-acid neurotransmitters are divided into three subtypes depending on their sensitivity to three specific agonists: kainate, quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The ionophores operated by NMDA are gated by Mg2+ in a voltage-dependent manner and allow passage of several cations, including Ca2+ which may be important in plastic alterations of neuronal excitability. Indeed, specific antagonists of NMDA receptors effectively block spatial learning, long-term potentiation and some animal models of chronic epilepsy. Despite their abundance on central neurons, NMDA receptors, with a few noteworthy exceptions, do not generally seem to be involved in low-frequency synaptic transmission. Here we report for the first time that NMDA receptors of the dentate gyrus, where they do not normally contribute to the generation of synaptic potentials, become actively involved in synaptic transmission following long-lasting neuronal changes induced by daily electrical stimulation (kindling) of the amygdala or hippocampal commissures. In contrast to controls, the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e.p.s.ps) of granule cells in hippocampal slices obtained from kindled animals displayed characteristics typical of an NMDA-receptor-mediated component. The involvement of NMDA receptors in synaptic transmission may underlie the long-lasting changes in neuronal function induced by kindling.\r"

  ".W": "Parkinson's disease is an illness with neuropathological and neuroanatomical abnormalities in many areas of the central nervous system. Some clinical manifestations of this illness are correlated with pathological changes in the substantia nigra and with a loss of dopamine in the nigra and striatum. The most effective pharmacological treatments have used agents that either replace the lost dopamine or act as agonists on dopamine receptors. Recent studies in animal models of Parkinson's disease demonstrate that the loss of dopamine and many clinical manifestations of dopamine reduction can be reversed by transplantation of fetal dopamine-containing cells to specific dopamine-depleted areas of the brain. Long term viability of these transplants has also been demonstrated. The author suggests that the transplantation of dopamine neurons, even across species barriers, is a reasonable consideration for the treatment of human Parkinson's disease. This article reviews in detail the results of recent experiments and how the experience in these models might be utilized in determining a transplantation strategy for the treatment of specific clinical aspects of this illness.\r"

The authors investigated the efficacy of using a temporarily placed hard contact lens to neutralize surface irregularities in conjunction with the PAM in predicting post-keratoplasty visual acuity. A prospective evaluation was performed on 40 keratoplasty patients with a mean follow-up of 10.4 months. Of 27 patients with corneas clear enough to permit them to read letters on the PAM chart, 17 (63%) had very accurately predicted visual acuities by this new method, compared to only eight patients (30%) with the PAM alone. Three patients had predicted visions better than final vision, but this was due to a concurrent cataract in two cases and chronic cystoid macular edema (CME) in the third case. This study indicates that temporarily placing a hard contact lens for use with the PAM can increase its accuracy in predicting final visual acuity after penetrating keratoplasty.\r"

  ".U": "87174236\r", 
  ".W": "Because autogenous bone grafts are histocompatible by definition and because the hand does not require massive bone grafts, one may question the indications for using allogeneic bone in the hand. Although humans have been shown to develop donorgraft specific antibodies following large osteochondral allografts, these antibodies have not yet been noted after smaller bone grafts nor is the clinical significance of these antibodies clear. The use of allogeneic bone better satisfies the architectural and strength requirements for reconstruction when there is a need for osteochondral grafts, strong cortical grafts to allow secure fixation and early motion, and small tubular grafts that meet the demands of minimizing bulk in the hand. For the repair of osteochondral defects, autogenous grafts (ie, fibular head or metatarsal head) impose donor site deficits that can be clinically significant. In addition, grafts such as the fibular head do not provide reconstruction of a congruent joint surface. Strong cortical bone is an asset in metacarpal reconstruction; it enhances the quality of internal fixation, which in turn allows hand therapy to be started early, an essential treatment following hand injuries. A stiff hand after reconstruction will result despite excellent bony reconstruction if the fixation does not allow early motion. Autogenous cortical grafts donor sites (eg, ulna or tibia) can cause donor site morbidity, including fracture of weakened bone. The need for small tubular grafts is especially important in pediatric patients. Strong autogenous corticocancellous grafts are difficult to obtain in children, and these grafts are bulky and difficult to insert. In addition, for adults and children, the lack of a donor site means a much shorter hospital stay.\r"

To establish a diagnosis, the geneticist must be familiar with the entire gamut of genetic and nongenetic disorders. Even when the diagnosis is made by laboratory tests or physical examination, the pervasiveness of genetic/etiologic heterogeneity demands that the geneticist be skilled in the extraction of a thorough family history and in the subtleties of pedigree interpretation. Multiple specialty referrals may be solicited. Counseling is an involved process that includes a thorough discussion of the nature, etiology, and prognosis of the disorder; its burden; its recurrence risk; and the alternatives at the family's disposal for dealing with that risk. Calculation of the recurrence risk itself may require special mathematical techniques. For parents to assimilate this extensive information, they must be receptive. If they are grieving heavily, denying the existence of the problem, or busy tending to the medical or financial needs of their child, counseling is seriously compromised. For these reasons, geneticists may assume the responsibility of coordinator of services to facilitate the difficult experience of bearing a child with a serious developmental disorder.

  ".W": "Pediatricians can learn to assess adolescent patients' use of drugs and alcohol. Their most important task is to determine whether use of chemicals is causing behavioral impairment. A general psychosocial assessment of an adolescent's functioning is the most important component of an evaluation for substance abuse. It provides the foundation for determining whether behavioral dysfunction exists. The pediatrician should address several topical areas: family relationships, school performance and attendance, peer relationships, legal difficulties, leisure activities and employment, and self-perception. The chemical use history helps the pediatrician in two ways. In general, it helps to provide focus to the pediatrician's educational counseling about the risks of chemical use. It also helps the pediatrician to determine whether substance abuse is the cause of any behavioral dysfunction that the pediatrician may have discovered during the general psychosocial assessment. Strategies to enhance more accurate disclosure of substance use by adolescents include postponing this section of the interview until rapport has been developed with the teenager, ordering questions so that illicit substances are addressed later, exploring peer involvement with chemicals as an antecedent to discussing the adolescent's personal use, and using an historical perspective, so that the teenager is asked to describe his or her initial experience with each substance class prior to addressing current use patterns. Dysfunctional consequences of chemical use may present an opportunity for adolescents and their families to accept intervention. If the pediatrician believes that an adolescent patient would benefit from a formal treatment program, the following steps help to ensure successful completion of the referral. The pediatrician should first summarize information learned during the evaluation that is relevant to the problem behaviors. Try to outline the dysfunctional behavior in the context of chemical use. Communicate concern for the teenager's well-being. Provide information without moralizing or lecturing. Clarify your role as pediatrician. Try to personalize the referral process to prevent feelings of rejection by the adolescent and family. If necessary, provide concrete assistance to the family to facilitate the referral process.\r"

One major problem for teenagers is that the diagnosis and treatment of adolescent substance abuse is based primarily on adult models of alcoholism.\r"

Twenty patients received ribavirin and 10 received placebo. There were no significant differences between the groups in chronologic or gestational age or in days of illness prior to admission. Among patients with pneumonia 17% of 6 placebo patients vs. 64% of 11 ribavirin patients had radiographic evidence that multiple lung lobes were affected (P = 0.06). Placebo patients received 42.5 to 94.7 hours (mean, 58.6) of aerosol therapy, whereas ribavirin patients received 36.3 to 95.6 hours (mean, 55.7). Seventy-seven percent of all study patients were discharged within 5 days of starting treatment. Severity of illness was evaluated daily using a scale of 0 (normal) to 4+ (most severe). Ribavirin patients initially had a mean severity score 0.5 higher than placebo patients. By Day 2, their rate of improvement was significantly greater than that of placebo patients (P = 0.001). By Day 5, 36% of ribavirin patients with rales showed improvement, whereas rales persisted in 100% of placebo patients. The rate of improvement of oxygen saturation from first to last day of treatment was statistically significant only for ribavirin patients (P = 0.02). On Day 3, 65% of ribavirin patients (13) vs. 50% (5) placebo patients shed 10(-0.5) 50% tissue culture infective dose virus per 0.2 ml of nasal wash. No side effects or toxicity were associated with aerosol therapy. A short course of ribavirin treatment (approximately 3 days) proved safe and beneficial.\r"

Initially 39 of the 119 (33%) vaccine recipients compared with 1 of the 120 placebo recipients seroconverted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-immunoglobulin M. After the first winter rotavirus season, at 7 months of age 55% of the vaccinated infants and 37% of the unvaccinated infants were rotavirus-seropositive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-immunoglobulin G (P less than 0.01, chi square test). At 12 months of age, after a low rotavirus prevalence season, 34% of the vaccinated children and 23% of the unvaccinated children remained seropositive. There were 14 confirmed episodes of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the vaccine group and 10 episodes in the placebo group during the first 16 months. However, only 1 of the episodes in the vaccine group was severe, 4 were moderately severe and 9 were mild, whereas 7 episodes in the placebo group were severe and 3 were moderately severe (P less than 0.001 between groups, Fisher's exact test). There was no clear correlation between vaccine-induced clinical protection and initial serologic response (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-immunoglobulin M) to vaccination, but during follow-up severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was more likely to occur in children with no serum rotavirus immunoglobulin G antibody at the time of infection. We conclude at the present stage that neonatal rotavirus vaccination with RIT 4237 vaccine gives no protection against rotavirus infection but appears to modify the severity of gastroenteritis.\r"

Also 10 of 620 (1.6%) infants had detectable antigen in the absence of proved infection. In addition, in 4 other infants with Group B streptococcal bacteremia, antigenemia was absent in serum obtained on the day of hospitalization but antigen was detected in specimens obtained subsequently. We also assayed the sera of 102 randomly chosen hospitalized adults; 4 (4%) contained \"antigen\" but none had Group B streptococcal infection. None of 50 urines obtained from other randomly chosen hospitalized adults contained \"antigen.\" In patients with Group B streptococcal meningitis cerebrospinal fluid and unconcentrated urine uniformly contained antigen but in bacteremia without focality, assay of blood and urine were both necessary to diagnose correctly all 7 patients with the Wellcogen test. We conclude that despite acceptable sensitivity and specificity, the interpretation of the Wellcogen test must be performed with caution and knowledge of its limitations.\r"

Because of uncertainties regarding outcome, particularly in the presence of hypothermia, vigorous emergency department resuscitation of all drowning victims is advisable, regardless of presentation. However, it may prove that emergency department assessment of such patients, following successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a prognostic indicator of great importance in dictating further care. Transfer of these severely injured patients to a pediatric referral center where intracranial pressure monitoring and intensive support are available offers the best hope.

To put things in perspective, the recipient waiting list at the University of Pittsburgh never includes fewer than 200 suitable candidates, and it continues to grow in spite of the fact that we are now doing essentially one transplant per day. There are many excellent transplant centers throughout the United States and Europe, the only limiting factor being the supply of donors. Orthotopic liver transplantation is now covered by most major health insurance carriers, and some form of government coverage is anticipated for the indigent. As the supply of donors increases with aggressive education programs, the need for transplantation centers will also increase. However, this should not be uncontrolled growth. Mandatory training in transplantation surgery will surely be required as a prerequisite to the establishment of transplant centers in the future. The field of organ transplantation is the newest and most dynamic in medicine today. The results are encouraging and acceptable and offer the only hope to many persons dying of end-stage organ failure. With improvements in immune modulation at hand, organ transplantation will soon become a commonplace procedure offering a completely normal life expectancy.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of d(GATC) sequences in Escherichia coli DNA mismatch correction was ascertained by analyzing in vitro repair efficiencies of a series of related, covalently closed circular DNA heteroduplexes that contained from zero to four d(GATC) sites. A heteroduplex with four d(GATC) sites was repaired with high efficiency by extracts of E. coli, whereas no significant correction occurred on a closely related molecule lacking such sequences. Heteroduplexes containing one or two d(GATC) sites were corrected at rates between 10% and 93% of that observed for the four-site molecule, but repair efficiency did not correlate in a simple way with the number of sites present. The methylation state at a single d(GATC) sequence was sufficient to direct strandedness of repair, and correction of heteroduplexes containing one or more d(GATC) sites required functional mutH, mutL, and mutS gene products. In addition, DNA repair synthesis dependent on mutH and mutS also required the presence of at least one d(GATC) site. Although mismatch correction was not observed on a covalently closed circular heteroduplex lacking a d(GATC) sequence, such molecules were subject to strand-specific repair if they contained a strand-specific single-strand break. However, this correction reaction did not require mutH, mutL, mutS, or uvrD gene products. Consequently, we have concluded that d(GATC) sequences are directly involved in mismatch correction mediated by the mutHLS system.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin treatment (Kact, 5 X 10(-9) M) of serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulates a soluble serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) in vitro. Maximal activation of MAP-2 kinase activity by 80 nM insulin was observed after 10 min of hormonal stimulation, prior to maximal stimulation of S6 kinase activity (20 min). The insulin-stimulatable MAP-2 kinase activity is not adsorbed to phosphocellulose, whereas the principal S6 kinase activity is retained and elutes at approximately 0.5 M NaCl. The insulin-stimulatable MAP-2 kinase is less stable during incubation at 30 degrees C than S6 kinase activity. Inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors decreases the rate at which the stimulated MAP-2 kinase activity is lost from extract supernatants incubated at 30 degrees C. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate is more effective than DL-phosphotyrosine, whereas DL-phosphoserine is without effect at the concentration used (40 mM). The difference in MAP-2 kinase activity in extract supernatants from control and insulin-treated cells is also preserved after rapid chromatography on Sephadex G-25. These results show that a soluble serine/threonine kinase is rapidly activated by insulin, possibly by phosphorylation of either the kinase itself or an interacting modulator.\r"

Labeled RNAs synthesized in E. coli strains containing plasmids bearing wild-type or mutant trp leader regions of S. marcescens or E. coli were isolated by hybridization and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The labeled RNAs synthesized in vivo on the S. marcescens wild-type and deletion mutant plasmids were the same size as the in vitro pause and leader transcripts. Hybridization of the presumed in vivo pause RNAs, and control in vitro pause RNAs, to M13 phage DNA containing a trp leader region deletion followed by treatment with S1 nuclease produced identical protected RNA species, proving that the in vitro and in vivo RNAs were identical. The amount of labeled pause RNAs relative to leader RNAs decreased following a chase with unlabeled uridine. E. coli RNAs identical to the previously characterized in vitro pause and leader transcripts were demonstrated by electrophoretic band position and fingerprint analysis. The finding that transcription pausing occurs in vivo is consistent with the view that transcription pausing and ribosome release of paused transcription complexes are responsible for the coupling of translation with transcription that is crucial to attenuation.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the photophysics of energy migration and trapping in photosystem I by investigating the spectral and temporal properties of the fluorescence from the core antenna chlorophylls as a function of the antenna size. Time-correlated single photon counting was used to determine the fluorescence lifetimes in the isolated P700 chlorophyll a-protein complex and in a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that lacks the photosystem II reaction center complex. The fluorescence decay in both types of sample is dominated by a fast (15-45 psec) component that is attributed to the lifetime of excitations in the photosystem I core antenna. These excitations decay primarily by an efficient photochemical quenching on P700. The measured lifetimes show a linear relationship to the core antenna size. A linear dependence of the excitation lifetime on antenna size was predicted previously in a lattice model for excitation migration and trapping in arrays of photosynthetic pigments [Pearlstein, R.M. (1982) Photochem. Photobiol. 35, 835-844]. Based on this model, our data predict a time constant for photochemical charge separation in the photosystem I reaction center of 2.8 +/- 0.7 or 3.4 +/- 0.7 psec, assuming monomeric or dimeric P700, respectively. The predicted average single-step transfer time for excitation transfer between core antenna pigments is 0.21 +/- 0.04 psec. Under these conditions, excitation migration in photosystem I is near the diffusion limit, with each excitation making an average of 2.4 visits to the reaction center before photoconversion.\r"

N-Methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp) is an excitatory amino acid derivative that is a powerful convulsant agent when injected into the cerebral cortex, amygdala, or hippocampus in rats. Bilateral microinjections of N-Me-D-Asp into the caudate-putamen, however, protected against limbic seizures induced by pilocarpine (injected systemically), with an ED50 of 0.7 nmol (range 0.5-1.0 nmol). Lesioning the caudate-putamen (by bilateral microinjection of the excitotoxin ibotenate) converted subconvulsant doses of pilocarpine into convulsant ones. The anticonvulsant action of N-Me-D-Asp in the caudate-putamen was reversed by blocking gamma-aminobutyrate-mediated inhibition in the substantia nigra pars reticulata or in the entopeduncular nucleus. The results suggest that the caudate-putamen and its gamma-aminobutyrate-dependent efferent pathways modulate the threshold for seizures in the limbic forebrain.\r"

  ".W": "A potassium channel in membranes of the insulin-secreting B-cell line, RIN m5F, was studied using the patch-clamp technique. In cell-attached patches, and for pipette solutions containing 140 mM KCl, the I-V curves exhibited a pronounced rectification, with the conductance being higher when the current flowed from the electrode into the cell (50 pS). Addition of glucose (5-7 mM) to the bath was sufficient to abolish the channel activity, while low doses of the metabolic inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenyl enhanced it, indicating a link between channel activity and cell metabolism. In excised inside-out patches, the activity of a channel with similar conductive properties was inhibited by ATP in a dose-dependent fashion, the half-maximal concentration being approximately 70 microM. ADP also acted as an inhibitor, but with much lower potency. However, when ADP was present, the blocking effectiveness of ATP was reduced, suggesting a nonadditive interaction of the two nucleotides with the channel. In conclusion, complete closure of the K channel by glucose (5-7 mM) suggests that this channel may be responsible for the early phase of the B-cell depolarization, which is seen in normal cells for glucose increments up to similar values. In addition, since ATP and ADP are both present in the cells, the reduction by ADP of the blocking efficacy of ATP in excised patches may help one to understand why, in intact cells, the channel is still functional for intracellular ATP concentrations that in excised patches would completely suppress its activity.\r"

The sites act in a polar fashion, and replication forks traveling in a clockwise direction with respect to the genetic map are not inhibited as they pass through T1 but are inhibited at T2. Similarly, counterclockwise forks are not inhibited at T2 but are inhibited at T1. Consequently, forks are not inhibited until they have passed through the terminus region and are about to leave it. Studies with deletion strains have located T2 within a 58-kilobase interval, which corresponds to kilobase coordinates 387-445 on the physical map of the terminus region.\r"

By determining the strand preference of Okazaki fragments that are specific for markers from the T1-T2 interval, it was shown that this interval is replicated in either direction, depending upon the strain analyzed. In addition, we also observed that forks moving in the \"unnatural\" direction along each oriC-T1 or -T2 arm are very slow, especially in the one-third portion of the chromosome around the terminators. We propose that this phenomenon is a consequence of nucleoid organization, which is proposed to be symmetrical on the two oriC-T1 or -T2 arms and polarized with respect to the direction of replication. We also propose that T1 and T2 are the terminal limits of these two polarized half-nucleoid bodies.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin stimulates phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue(s) on a 15-kDa protein (p15), and the cytosolic phosphorylated protein (pp15) accumulates only when 3T3-L1 adipocytes are treated with phenylarsine oxide. It has been shown previously that phenylarsine oxide, an agent that complexes vicinal dithiols, interrupts signal transmission from the insulin receptor to the glucose transport system. Several lines of evidence presented here indicate the involvement of pp15 in insulin receptor-initiated signal transduction to the glucose transport system. The reciprocal effects of phenylarsine oxide on the insulin-activated accumulation of pp15 and on insulin-stimulated hexose uptake are reversed by the vicinal dithiol 2,3-dimercaptopropanol but not by the monothiol 2-mercaptoethanol. Thus, a cellular dithiol appears to function in the signal transmission pathway downstream from pp15. Like the insulin-activated autophosphorylation of the receptor's beta subunit (on tyrosine), activation of phosphorylation of p15 is specific, with insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor being inactive. Moreover, both processes exhibit identical insulin concentration dependence. The temporal kinetic relationship of insulin-activated receptor beta-subunit phosphorylation, followed by the phosphorylation of p15 and then increased hexose uptake rate, is consistent with an intermediary signaling role for pp15 in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.\r"

The primary mechanism of the polymer effect seems to be to increase the binding of polymerase to DNA.

In 3T3 cells, cytosynalin is located on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. The staining pattern of cytosynalin observed with anti-cytosynalin antibodies was similar to that observed with antibodies against calspectin (nonerythroid spectrin or fodrin). Cytosynalin binds to calspectin and to tubulin and actin filaments, as determined by binding assays, turbidity measurements, low-shear viscometry, and electron microscopy. Furthermore, after heating at 90 degrees C for 5 min, cytosynalin retains its binding activity toward calmodulin and cytoskeletal elements. These results lead to the conclusion that cytosynalin is colocalized with calspectin at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, probably in association with other cytoskeletal elements.\r"

These tubular structures can be identified as lysosomes by acid phosphatase histochemistry and immunofluorescence localization of cathepsin L. The abundance of tubular lysosomes is markedly increased by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml). When labeled by pinocytosis of microperoxidase and examined by electron microscopic histochemistry, the tubular lysosomes have an outside diameter of approximately 75 nm and a length of several micrometers; they radiate from the cell's centrosphere in alignment with cytoplasmic microtubules and intermediate filaments. Incubation of phorbol myristate acetate-treated macrophages at 4 degrees C or in medium containing 5 microM colchicine or nocodazole at 37 degrees C leads to disassembly of microtubules and fragmentation of the tubular lysosomes. Return of the cultures to 37 degrees C or removal of nocodazole from the medium leads to reassembly of microtubules and the reappearance of tubular lysosomes within 10-20 min. We conclude that microtubules are essential for the maintenance of tubular lysosome morphology and that, in macrophages, a significant proportion of the lysosomal compartment is contained within these tubular structures.\r"

IgG binding to knobby erythrocytes appeared to be related to parasite development, since binding of 125I-labeled protein A to cells bearing young trophozoites (less than 20 hr after parasite invasion) was similar to binding to uninfected erythrocytes. By immunoelectron microscopy, the membrane-bound IgG on erythrocytes infected with the knobby variant was found to be preferentially associated with the protuberances (knobs) of the plasma membrane. The removal of aged or senescent erythrocytes from the peripheral circulation is reported to involve the binding of specific antibodies to an antigen (senescent antigen) related to the major erythrocyte membrane protein band 3. Since affinity-purified autoantibodies against band 3 specifically bound to the plasma membrane of erythrocytes infected with the knobby variant of P. falciparum, it is clear that the malaria parasite induces expression of senescent antigen.\r"

This peptide was also attached to erythrocytes by coupling myristic acid to its amino terminus and allowing the myristoylated peptide to bind to erythrocytes through hydrophobic interactions. Erythrocytes coated with this RGD-containing segment of C3 were bound by macrophages, and binding could be blocked by specific monoclonal antibodies against CR3. Since CR3 recognizes a peptide sequence that contains the RGD triplet, it appears to be a member of a larger family of adhesion-promoting receptors that recognize RGD-containing proteins. However, since CR3 does not recognize a hexapeptide containing RGD, we presume that residues beyond the RGD triplet contribute to binding. We have compared the RGD-containing region of fibronectin and vitronectin, proteins known to be recognized by means of their RGD-containing regions, with those in human and murine C3. A striking homology is observed over an approximately equal to 50 amino acid sequence present in all four proteins. We suggest that this extended region of homology contains a structure recognized by adhesion-promoting receptors.\r"

The minimal firing rate was reached in 2 min, and the effect was gone within 4 min. The effect of insulin was dose-related and did not occur when comparable volumes of physiological saline were injected into the ventromedial hypothalamus. Destruction of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus by injection of kainic acid abolished the inhibitory effects of insulin. These data suggest that insulin may play a role in modulating the sympathetic firing rate to thermogenically important tissues.\r"

Both 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine appear to completely block reverse transcription from viral RNA to viral DNA. Viral mRNA expression is also not detected in cells protected by the drugs throughout 30 days of culture following exposure to the virus. Purine and pyrimidine analogues as 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside-5'-triphosphate serve as substrates for the human T-lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus reverse transcriptase to elongate a DNA chain by one residue, after which the chain is terminated. Cloned normal helper/inducer T cells exposed to a cytopathic dose of the virus, but protected by the drugs, respond normally to specific antigen in vitro.

Yet, in CNS immunological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis in humans, these constituents of the immune response must appear by some mechanism. Immunohistochemical examination of the CNS of F1 hybrid rats following induction of graft-vs.-host disease by parental lymphocytes revealed extensive parenchymal and vascular expression of host class I and II (Ia) MHC-encoded cell surface molecules. In addition, occasional scattered T lymphocytes were detected in the CNS of these animals. F1 hybrid rats reconstituted during the neonatal period with bone marrow cells from one parental strain also expressed increased levels of MHC antigens in the CNS. Thus, evidence is presented that the \"immunological privilege\" of the CNS seems to decrease or disappear during a strong systemic immune response such as graft-vs.-host disease. These findings may have important implications concerning the mechanism of induction of human CNS immunological diseases.\r"

Since each of these regions contains a large number of cholecystokinin-immunoreactive cells, we used an indirect immunohistochemical method to examine the possibility that levels of this peptide are modulated by circulating gonadal steroids in adult male rats. Rats were castrated at 60 days of age, and one group each was pretreated with colchicine and then killed 3, 7, and 14 days after gonadectomy. Castration clearly decreased CCK immunoreactivity within cells of each region, with the most dramatic effects occurring 7 and 14 days after gonadectomy, and these effects were reversed by treatment with testosterone over a 14-day period. The results suggest that CCK levels within individual cells in each of the interconnected sexually dimorphic nuclei examined here are regulated by circulating gonadal steroids and may be related to the hormonal modulation of reproductive functions thought to be mediated by these cell groups.\r"

  ".U": "87175625\r", 
  ".W": "The 20 known transforming (onc) genes of retroviruses are defined by sequences that are transduced from cellular genes termed protooncogenes or cellular oncogenes. Based on these sequences, viral onc genes have been postulated to be transduced cellular cancer genes, and proto-onc genes have been postulated to be latent cancer genes that can be activated from within the cell to cause virus-negative tumors. The hypothesis is popular because it promises direct access to cellular cancer genes. However, the existence of latent cancer genes presents a paradox, since such genes are clearly undesirable. The hypothesis predicts that viral onc genes and proto-onc genes are isogenic; that expression of proto-onc genes induces tumors; that activated proto-onc genes transform diploid cells upon transfection, like viral onc genes; and that diploid tumors exist. As yet, none of these predictions is confirmed. Instead: Structural comparisons between viral onc genes, essential retroviral genes, and proto-onc genes show that all viral onc genes are indeed new genes, rather than transduced cellular cancer genes. They are recombinants put together from truncated viral and truncated proto-onc genes. Proto-onc genes are frequently expressed in normal cells. To date, not one activated proto-onc gene has been isolated that transforms diploid cells. Above all, no diploid tumors with activated proto-onc genes have been found. Moreover, the probability of spontaneous transformation in vivo is at least 10(9) times lower than predicted from the mechanisms thought to activate proto-onc genes. Therefore, the hypothesis that proto-onc genes are latent cellular oncogenes appears to be an overinterpretation of sequence homology to structural and functional homology with viral onc genes. Here it is proposed that only rare truncations and illegitimate recombinations that alter the germ-line configuration of cellular genes generate viral and possibly cellular cancer genes. The clonal chromosome abnormalities that are consistently found in tumor cells are microscopic evidence for rearrangements that may generate cancer genes. The clonality indicates that the tumors are initiated with, and possibly by, these abnormalities, as predicted by Boveri in 1914.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the chromatin structure of the 5'-flanking region of the albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (Afp) genes in different developing rat tissues and cloned cell lines that display various functional states of these genes. Nuclease-hypersensitive sites were probed with DNase I, using an indirect end-labeling technique. In albumin-producing rat cells two major DNase I-hypersensitive sites were found near the promoter region and one additional site was located approximately 3 kilobases (kb) upstream. Similarly, in Afp-producing rat tissues and cell lines we mapped one DNase I-hypersensitive region close to the promoter region and two cleavage sites further upstream at approximately 2.2 and approximately 3.8 kb from the cap site. The DNase I-hypersensitive sites of both genes were absent in nonhepatic rat cells and therefore appear to be tissue specific. Loss of specific sets of DNase I-hypersensitive sites accompanies the cessation of transcription for the Afp gene in adult rat liver and in a \"dedifferentiated\" hepatoma cell line. Likewise, specific sets of DNase I-hypersensitive sites disappear during the inactivation of the albumin gene in hepatoma cells. The distal upstream sites of the Afp and albumin genes display the same DNase I sensitivity in expressing and potentially expressible states. These findings suggest that reversible changes in short chromatin regions may be involved in the actual transcription of the albumin and Afp genes, while more permanent tissue-specific changes at other sites correlate with the capacity of these genes to be expressed during hepatic differentiation and neoplasia.\r"

We show that this gene is essential for cell growth, since a null mutation constructed with standard gene disruption techniques results in cell lethality. The ALG7 gene is transcribed into two major messages, approximately 1.38 and 1.56 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size, and this heterogeneity has been mapped to the 3' untranslated region. Two sets of tripartite sequences implicated in transcription termination begin 15 bp and 256 bp past the translation stop codon, TGA. The ratios of the two major transcripts change with gene dosage, with the longer mRNA becoming more abundant in cells containing higher levels of the ALG7 gene. Changes in transcript ratios are also observed in mutants defective in lipid-linked sugar-donor biosynthesis. In addition, there is 5' heterogeneity in the ALG7 mRNAs. The transcripts start at four initiation sites located within a 20-bp region. Two potentially functional TATA elements have been identified at positions -157 and -139, which may be involved in initiation from multiple sites. These features point to numerous factors that may be involved in the regulation of the expression of the ALG7 gene.\r"

Mammalian expression modules encoding the dominant marker neomycin phosphotransferase or the amplifiable dihydrofolate reductase gene expressed from SV40 promoters were inserted for use in gene transfer studies. Restriction sites for the enzymes Not I and Sfi I, which cut mammalian DNA very infrequently, have been engineered near the transcriptional promoters to enable the excision of most inserts as single, full-length fragments. Genomic libraries representative of mouse, human, and hamster genomes were constructed by inserting 33- to 44-kilobase-pair (kbp) DNA fragments, generated by partial cleavage of genomic DNA with Mbo I or Sau3A, into the unique BamHI site. Digestion of recombinant cosmids with restriction enzymes that cleave frequently but do not disrupt the transcriptional promoters generates two small DNA templates for the synthesis of end-specific RNA probes to facilitate directional \"walking.\" Cosmid restriction maps can be determined rapidly by one of several methods. The cosmids and methods we describe should have wide utility in determining the functional and structural organization of complex eukaryotic genomes and for physically linking distant genetic loci.\r"

This occurs under conditions where cyclic adenine nucleotide concentrations are unchanged. We report here that glycogenolysis stimulated by 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, an analog with 100 times tighter affinity than cAMP for the protein kinase regulatory subunit, was only slightly antagonized by insulin. The tight binding of this analog appears to overcome the protein kinase affinity change induced by insulin. The relative importance of the two intrachain cAMP binding sites of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit was investigated by using analogs with relative selectivity for each site. Analogs exhibiting preferential binding to site 2 were far less sensitive to insulin antagonism than were analogs binding preferentially at site 1 and less well at site 2. No other property of these analogs, including the rate of hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase, the IC50 for phosphodiesterase, the Ka for protein kinase, or the type I versus type II kinase specificity, could account for the ability of insulin to antagonize glycogenolysis stimulated by these analogs. These data indicate that insulin may act to decrease the affinity of protein kinases for cAMP through a possible regulation of intrachain site 2 binding.\r"

Antigenically reactive proteins were recognized in subcellular organelles related to protein synthesis and processing, including polyribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus, as well as on the cytoplasmic surface of plasma membranes. Prominent immunoreactive proteins were also shown in association with nuclear chromatin in intact cells and in isolated nuclei using Lowicryl K4M resin embedding techniques. Protein A-gold labeling was markedly reduced in sections of non-SSV-transformed fibroblasts incubated with anti-PDGF and absent from SSV-transformed cells if Epon resin was substituted for Lowicryl in the embedding process or if sections were with irrelevant antisera. Nuclear localization of v-sis-related antigens was confirmed in a nitrocellulose-based immunoassay using nuclei isolated from SSV-transformed fibroblasts. Thus, polypeptides recognized antigenically as related to the v-sis gene product not only may be found in subcellular organelles associated with protein synthesis and packaging but also may be found in the nucleus of SSV-transformed cells.

Most of the CABP1 antigen in early developing cells is localized near the cell periphery, with a small amount found in the nucleus. The level of CABP1 in the nucleus increases approximately 30-fold during development. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies showed that CABP1 can also be detected on the cell surface. Binding of anti-CABP1 to intact cells followed by reaction with 125I-labeled secondary antibody revealed that the cell-surface CABP1 activity peaks during aggregation and culmination. In addition, several proteins related to CABP1 are found mainly in the nuclear fraction of developing cells. The possible role of these proteins in the regulation of developmental gene activity is discussed.\r"

Nearly all of the missense mutations that alter the DNA binding domain abolish the DNA binding activity of GAL4 protein measured in vitro. In contrast, nearly all of the mutations that alter the 3' 95% of the gene that encodes the transcription activation function are nonsense or frameshift mutations.

  ".W": "Osmotic pumps containing Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) were attached to indwelling jugular vein catheters and implanted subcutaneously into Golden Syrian hamsters. Within 3 days, peripheral granulocyte counts had increased greater than 10-fold with a concomitant 4-fold increase in total leukocytes. Microscopic examination of Wright-Giemsa-stained blood smears from rhG-CSF hamsters showed that only the neutrophil subpopulation of granulocytes had increased. No significant changes in lymphocyte or monocyte counts were observed during the course of continuous rhG-CSF treatment. After subcutaneous injection at rhG-CSF doses of up to 10 micrograms X kg-1 X day-1 only granulocyte counts were affected. However, at higher dose levels, a transient thrombocytopenia was noted. Erythrocyte had lymphocyte/monocyte counts remained unaffected by rhG-CSF over the entire dose range (0.3-300 micrograms X kg-1 X day-1) studied. Total leukocyte counts increased 3-fold within 12 hr after a single s.c. injection of rhG-CSF. This early effect was associated with an increase in the total number of colony-forming cells and the percent of active cycling cells in the marrow. A sustained elevation of peripheral leukocyte and marrow progenitor counts was observed following seven daily s.c. injections of rhG-CSF. The ability of rhG-CSF to increase the production and release of granulocytes from the marrow may underlie the beneficial effect it produced on the restoration of peripheral leukocyte counts in hamsters made leukopenic by treatment with 5-fluorouracil.\r"

Regrettably, barium examination of the small bowel has traditionally been regarded by many radiologists as a study of minor importance. Small bowel follow-through techniques and enteroclysis methods differ in their diagnostic purpose, potential, and methods of performance. This review examines in detail the spectrum of barium examination techniques currently available for evaluating the small bowel. The benefits of enteroclysis in the majority of clinical situations requiring contrast examination of the small bowel are stressed. Radiologists play the crucial role in the diagnostic evaluation of the small bowel and should strive to refine and advance the accuracy of small bowel radiography.\r"

Each patient underwent ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; seven also underwent computed tomography. In eight of nine patients the imaging studies disclosed intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct changes identical to those seen in sclerosing cholangitis (strictures, focal dilatation, thickened duct walls). Isolated papillary stenosis and ductal dilatation were present in one patient, while eight patients had some stricturing of the distal common duct. The combination of papillary stenosis and intrahepatic ductal strictures appears unique to AIDS-related cholangitis. Endoscopic papillotomy provided variable relief to symptoms and biochemical abnormalities. Cholangitis caused by cytomegalovirus and/or Cryptosporidium infection is the proposed pathophysiologic mechanism.\r"

US studies without Fluosol were compared with studies obtained 24, 48, and 72 hours after Fluosol infusion. Vital signs and extensive laboratory analyses are performed before and after Fluosol infusion. Liver metastases from colonic, pancreatic, and gastric carcinoma exhibited rim or diffuse enhancement after a Fluosol dose of 1.6 g/kg or greater. Fluosol produced echogenic enhancement of the liver and spleen relative to kidney at a dose of 2.4 g/kg, allowing the detection of nonenhancing lesions. In addition, Fluosol at a dose of 1.6 g/kg or greater allowed detection of lesions not seen before contrast medium was administered in three of the seven patients studied. There was a mild increase in the level of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in two patients, one given 2.4 and the other 3.2 g/kg of Fluosol. Mild and transient allergic reactions without change in vital signs were experienced by two patients.\r"

Portal vein thrombi of high attenuation were found in four patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. From pathologic and radiologic studies, it was concluded that the high attenuation was caused by blood clots of recent onset formed at the tip of tumor thrombus. Differentiation from choledocholithiasis, hematobilia, and calcification of thrombi could be easily made by means of ultrasonography (US). Although plain CT is usually considered noncontributory in the diagnosis of venous thrombosis, it enabled the differentiation of recent thrombus in these four patients. Tumor thrombus in the major branches or main trunk of the portal vein is indicative of poor prognosis. When hepatic mass and high-attenuation portal vein thrombi are demonstrated with plain CT and substantiated by US, enhanced CT and angiography may be unnecessary for treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Midline lesions were best imaged sagittally, and lesions of paired structures, axially. The coronal plane was useful in evaluating the superoinferior extent of lesions and in defining the extent of lymphadenopathy. T1-weighted sequences were sufficient to depict most congenital and cystic lesions. T2-weighted sequences were useful in demonstrating the extent of neoplasms and the position of ectopic gonads. Ultrasonography (US) was also performed in 45 cases. MR and US delineated lesions equally well in 25 cases (55.5%), MR was superior in 19 (42.4%), and US was superior in one (2.2%).

Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) were superior to MR in the first few days after parenchymal hemorrhage, since at this time lesions were apparent on only T2-weighted images. After the first 3 days, MR was the single best modality because (a) hemorrhage on CT became imperceptible in the 2d week, whereas the high signal of hemorrhage on MR persisted for 2-11 weeks; (b) MR permitted rough dating of hemorrhage according to changes in signal intensity; and (c) MR was superior in identifying subdural or epidural hemorrhage. Because of the nonspecificity and restricted field of view of US and the inability of CT to depict hemorrhage after 7-10 days, the authors conclude that MR significantly improves the detection of intracranial hemorrhage in neonates.\r"

Polyclonal antibodies (PAC-2) against the alpha subunits of purified rabbit skeletal muscle calcium channels immunoprecipitated calcium channels labeled with the dihydropyridine PN200-110 from both skeletal muscle and brain. The immunoreactivity of PAC-2 with the skeletal muscle channel was greater than that with the brain calcium channel and was absorbed only partially by prior treatment with the brain channel. PAC-2 specifically recognized a large peptide in synaptic plasma membranes of rabbit brain with an apparent molecular size of 169,000 daltons. This protein resembles an alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle calcium channel in apparent molecular weight, antigenic properties, and electrophoretic behavior after reduction of disulfide bonds. Thus, the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel of rabbit brain has an alpha subunit that is homologous, but not identical, to those of the skeletal muscle calcium channel. The different functional properties of these two calcium channels may result from minor variations in structurally similar components.\r"

The structure and function or functions of this deleted genetic material are unknown. The role of this deletion in the process of malignant transformation was investigated by introducing a normal human chromosome 11 into a Wilms' tumor cell line by means of the microcell transfer technique. These variant cells, derived by microcell hybridization, expressed similar transformed traits in culture as the parental cell line. Furthermore, expression of several proto-oncogenes by the parental cells was unaffected by the introduction of this chromosome. However, the ability of these cells to form tumors in nude mice was completely suppressed. Transfer of other chromosomes, namely X and 13, had no effect on the tumorigenicity of the Wilms' tumor cells. These studies provide support for the existence of genetic information on chromosome 11 which can control the malignant expression of Wilms' tumor cells.\r"

Of primary importance for the isolation and characterization of the raf product is to determine whether it is produced by the hepatocyte or whether it is produced by a different cell type. By means of analysis of alpha-fetoprotein expression in livers of embryo aggregation chimeras derived from mice of different raf genotypes it was possible to conclude that the product of the raf locus is expressed as a hepatocyte autonomous function that acts in trans to regulate the level of alpha-fetoprotein messenger RNA.\r"

A segment of the AIDS virus pol gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression resulted in the appearance of reverse transcriptase activity in the bacterial cell extracts. The extracts contained two virus-related polypeptides that have the same apparent molecular weights as the two processed forms of virion-derived reverse transcriptase (p66 and p51). The formation of these two polypeptides depended on the coexpression of sequences located near the 5' end of the pol gene, a region that is thought to encode a viral protease. This bacterial system appears to generate mature forms of the AIDS virus reverse transcriptase by a proteolytic pathway equivalent to that which occurs during virus infection of human cells.\r"

Mice were immunized with recombinant DNA-produced or synthetic peptide-carrier subunit vaccines derived from the repetitive epitopes of the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite gene, or with radiation-attenuated sporozoites. Immunization with subunit vaccines elicited humoral responses that were equivalent to or greater than those elicited by irradiated sporozoites, yet the protection against sporozoite challenge induced by either of the subunit vaccines was far less than that achieved by immunization with attenuated sporozoites. Passive and adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that subunit vaccines elicited predominantly antibody-mediated protection that was easily overcome whereas irradiated sporozoites induced potent cell-mediated immunity that protected against high challenge doses of sporozoites. These studies indicate that new strategies designed to induce cellular immunity will be required for efficacious sporozoite vaccines.\r"

Pain intensity values were lower at each hour in the naproxen sodium than in the PN/A group and significantly lower at hour 1 (P = .008). Pain intensity differences (PID, reflecting change from baseline) mirrored this trend: greater mean PIDs were seen in the naproxen sodium group at each hour, and this difference between drug groups was statistically significant at hour 1 (P = .017). One patient in the naproxen sodium group and seven patients using PN/A took a second dose within the six hours. Patients in each drug group reported five complaints.\r"

Of this number, 473 (61%) were discussions in medical and scientific journal articles; they were published in 188 journals, demonstrating the scattered nature of this literature. The recent increase of writing in ethics and cancer has been dramatic, the median year of publication being 1979. Although the majority of articles addressed more than one ethical issue, the most common topic was whether patients should be told the truth about their diagnosis and prognosis (found in 241 of the items identified). The ethics of cancer research has only recently assumed importance in the medical literature, the median year of publication being 1981. The great interest in the ethics of cancer research is evident in that 255 (33%) of the 776 items dealt with research, 104 of these focusing on randomized trials. Besides truth-telling and research, 78 other issues are being discussed, among them informed consent for adults (119 items), the physician's responsibility for psychologic management of patients (79 items) and their families (68 items), responsibilities of nurses (58 items), the use and testing of laetrile (55 items), and euthanasia (38 items). Surgery was discussed in 90 items, pediatrics in 71, and radiotherapy in 44. The authors of this literature relied upon at least nine identifiable ethical positions. Only a limited number of authors were aware of the philosophic literature and of the complexities inherent in defining such terms as \"benefit,\" \"harm,\" and \"quality of life.\"\r"

It is also recommended, by us, for patients over 40 years of age who have primary thyroid tumors greater than 1.5 cm in size whether or not nodes are clinically palpable. This is because at least 75 per cent of these patients have metastases, and their discernment at operation is unreliable. With more aggressive surgery, the recurrence-free survival rate can be improved substantially without cosmetic deformity or postoperative dysfunction.\r"

Although TSH seems to be an important physiologic growth factor, it is neither the exclusive growth factor for the thyroid gland nor absolutely necessary for the effect of other thyroid growth factors.

Because the etiology of this disorder remains obscure, its management remains controversial. Since antithyroid drugs and radioiodine became readily available in the early 1950s, they have been widely used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis, and the number of cases treated surgically has markedly decreased. However, almost four decades of experience have disclosed an unexpectedly high incidence of delayed hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment and a low remission rate after antithyroid therapy. As a result, surgery is again being advocated as the treatment of choice. The three modalities of treatment have different advantages and disadvantages, and selection of treatment is of importance. In principle, we believe that for most patients a subtotal thyroidectomy should be performed after the patient has been rendered euthyroid by antithyroid drugs. We attempt to leave a thyroid remnant of 6 to 8 gm.\r"

  ".W": "Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTNs) are presumably independent of TSH for growth and function and appear \"hot\" on scintiscan because they selectively concentrate radionuclide to a greater extent than the remaining thyroid gland, which is controlled by the normal TH-TSH feedback mechanism. Such autonomously functioning tissue may occur in \"patchy\" areas, as a solitary nodule, or as multiple nodules (classic Plummer's disease), with the mass of hyperfunctioning tissue and the related secretion of thyroid hormones determining whether the patient is euthyroid or hyperthyroid. Important diagnostic tests include a 99mTc thyroid scan, T4 RIA, T3 uptake, FTI, TSH RIA, and occasionally T3 RIA (\"T3 thyrotoxicosis\"). Solitary autonomous nodules in adult patients characteristically progress slowly over many years, with toxicity rarely developing in nodules less than 2.5 cm in diameter and occurring primarily in nodules 3 cm or larger and in older patients. The decision to treat a solitary nodule depends upon the size and degree of function of the nodule and the patient's age. Surgery and radioactive iodine are effective therapies. Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules in children and adolescents (under age 18) have a more rapidly progressive course than those in adults and should be treated by thyroid lobectomy at the time of diagnosis. Subtotal thyroidectomy is the preferred treatment for most patients with toxic multinodular goiter, because it achieves prompt control of the hyperthyroidism and removes the goiter. Radioiodine therapy and long-term antithyroid drug therapy are alternative forms of treatment for patients who are poor surgical risks or who develop recurrent hyperthyroidism following thyroid surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare tumor and its clinical course is variable. Differentiation of patients with parathyroid carcinoma from those with parathyroid adenoma is often difficult both preoperatively and at operation. For good results, the surgeon must recognize this disorder and perform an en bloc resection at the initial surgery. A neck dissection is necessary only when there is evidence of regional node metastases. After surgery, periodic follow-up of the serum calcium and iPTH levels is essential. When hypercalcemia recurs or the serum iPTH increases, localization studies with the use of thallium-201 scanning help detect local recurrence and regional lymph node metastases, but unfortunately, this method often fails to localize pulmonary metastases. Chest radiographs and CT scanning are useful for delineating pulmonary metastases. A wide excision of locally recurrent tumor, an en bloc radical neck dissection and mediastinum dissection for lymphatic metastases, and an aggressive surgical resection of lung metastases are recommended. Although these operations are rarely curative, they usually offer definite palliation of the marked hypercalcemia, often for a considerable period. Drugs to lower the serum calcium level and systemic chemotherapy are currently of only limited benefit, and radiation therapy is generally ineffective.\r"

If prophylactic measures and medical treatment of hyperparathyroidism fail, parathyroidectomy should be performed to prevent the progression of bone disease. Resolution of renal hyperparathyroidism is often seen after kidney transplantation, but some hypercalcemic patients require prophylactic or therapeutic parathyroidectomy. Hypocalcemia is the most common complication after parathyroidectomy. Our long-term results with subtotal parathyroidectomy are satisfactory. Total parathyroidectomy plus parathyroid autograft should be used in selected cases.\r"

  ".W": "A growing knowledge and awareness of bizarre clinical presentations, the physiology of new peptides, and the more frequent use of radioimmunoassay techniques has led to the identification of more patients with glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, vipomas, and ectopic tumors. Definite clinical syndromes, though sometimes seemingly \"silent,\" occur as a result of hypersecretion of newly identified hormones and neurotransmitters that act in endocrine, neurocrine, or paracrine fashion to alter normal metabolism of carbohydrates and electrolytes. Metabolically and clinically, glucagonomas are catabolic, somatostatinomas are inhibitory, and vipomas are diarrheogenic. The clinical syndromes can be differentiated from other, more common, endocrinopathies; the measurement of the plasma concentrations of the specific peptides is not only diagnostic, but prognostic. Specific pathologic confirmation of the functional potential of these tumors by immunocytochemical techniques is now possible. The goal of diagnosis is detection and tumor localization before metastases occur so that surgical excision may be curative. Objective clinical and humoral responses to chemotherapy for nonresectable or metastatic lesions can be expected in about 50 per cent of patients; specifically, dacarbazine (DTIC) is the agent of choice for glucagonomas, streptozotocin for somatostatinomas, and leukocyte interferon for vipomas.\r"

The peptic ulcer disease of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome can usually be controlled by large doses of one of the new potent gastric acid inhibitors. A battery of preoperative localizing tests can then be applied to guide exploratory laparotomy in non-MEN I patients. The tumor should be resected if possible, and continued low gastrin levels after operation provide evidence of a complete resection. It is reasonable to perform a parietal cell vagotomy at celiotomy because it will facilitate control of acid secretion if tumor resection is not successful. The only need for total gastrectomy is in a few patients whose acid secretion cannot be controlled with H2 receptor antagonists or who cannot comply with medical therapy. When no tumor is found at celiotomy, the prognosis for long-term tumor-free survival is excellent. Unfortunately, if unresectable hepatic metastases are present at operation, the patient is likely to die from metastatic tumor.\r"

Adrenocortical carcinomas are relatively rare, are usually incurable when diagnosed, and are an important consideration in the incidentally discovered adrenal mass found by CT scanning.\r"

Of 480 kidneys transplanted during a ten year period, 154 (32 per cent) were later removed. One hundred and eleven (72 per cent) nephrectomies were performed because of uncontrollable acute rejection within three months of transplantation. Thirty-eight (25 per cent) nephrectomies were performed because of graft failure due to chronic rejection and five (3 per cent) were carried out for other reasons. The only significant problem that occurred during graft nephrectomy was difficulty in controlling bleeding which occurred at nine (6 per cent) operations. No patient died during the operation. In the postoperative period, there were two (1 per cent) complications, perforated peptic ulcer and pseudomembranous colitis, which led to death and 22 (14 per cent) which were successfully treated. These consisted of nine infections, five lymph leaks, four hematemeses, three secondary hemorrhages and one urine leak. No significant difference could be shown in morbidity and mortality with respect to the time lapse between transplantation and graft nephrectomy. Transplant nephrectomy need not be as hazardous a procedure as has often been recorded provided it is not performed by an inexperienced surgeon, although the decision as to when to abandon a graft is often a finely balanced one.\r"

Patients were observed for two to seven months. Two partially clotted catheters were cleared with intraluminal urokinase. Skin breakdown at two exit sites responded to local care. The nursing staff and patient tolerated the procedure well. During BMT, fluid administration of 4,900 +/- 150 milliliters a day was possible without interruption of PN. Line or catheter site infections did not occur. Use of three intra-atrial [corrected] lumens eased the care of BMT patients and eliminated PN interruption.

Upper gastrointestinal tract series are the most reliable diagnostic tests but important additional information can be obtained by ultrasound and abdominal computerized tomography. The overwhelming majority of epithelioid leiomyomatous tumors are found in the gastric antrum. Round or polygonal cells are seen histologically. Often these cells have a clear zone that surrounds the nuclei. The origin of these tumors is debated. Less than one-third of these tumors metastasize. Complete surgical excision can often achieve cure. The exogastric lesions are the ones most readily cured by resection. Prognosis also correlates with clinical parameters including size of tumor, duration of symptoms and weight loss. Adjuvant therapy has not proved beneficial.\r"

A total of 80 patients with stroke onset within 24 hours were randomized into placebo (37 patients) and prostacyclin (43 patients) groups. Demographic data and risk factors were comparable. Patients in the prostacyclin group received a continuous i.v. infusion of prostacyclin at an average rate of 8.5 ng/kg/min for an average of 64 hours. The placebo group received vehicle only in a similar fashion. During treatment hemodynamic changes were more prominent in the patients receiving prostacyclin and included reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increase in pulse rate. In contrast there was only a slight (but significant) reduction of diastolic blood pressure in the placebo group. Neurologic deficit scores were determined on admission, at Day 3, and at Weeks 1, 2, and 4. Mean neurologic deficit scores upon entry were comparable in the placebo and prostacyclin groups, and a significant improvement in the score for neurologic deficit was noted in both. The placebo group tended to fare better throughout the study, with a significant difference in neurologic deficit score favoring the placebo group at Week 2 (p = 0.0048). Two patients in the placebo and one in the prostacyclin group died. The only difference in adverse reactions was flushing (6 patients in prostacyclin vs. 0 in placebo group, p less than 0.05). The results of this study suggest a lack of therapeutic efficacy of prostacyclin in a defined population of patients with nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction.\r"

The patient survival has been acceptable, but there has been a disappointing incidence of rejection and graft loss in patients who have survived the first 3 months. We feel our experience would indicate that by targeting our CsA dosages to such low serum levels some of our patients receive suboptimal immunosuppression. Perhaps the best way of overcoming this is add a third maintenance immunosuppressive agent such as azathioprine to supplement immunosuppression. In fact, we have now changed our immunosuppressive protocol to include azathioprine while maintaining our CsA therapy at its current level.\r"
