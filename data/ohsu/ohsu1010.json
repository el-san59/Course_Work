  ".W": "A total of 1628 women with CIN 3 treated with the Semm cold coagulator between 1975 and 1989 was followed primarily by cytology. The standard suitability criteria for ablation were adhered to except that patients were treated at their first visit when the colposcopist expected that the diagnosis would be no worse than CIN 3. Overall 97% of the women were treated at their first visit. In 30 women (2%) the histology was glandular or worse than expected, but 22 of these showed no persistent cervical disease subsequently. Follow-up was achieved for 87% at 10 years. In actuarial terms the primary success rate was 95% at 1 year and 92% at 5 years, it was similar for all age groups. Repeat cold-coagulation for persistent/recurrent CIN 3 was less successful and is not advised. The outcome for 226 pregnancies established after treatment is known. The rates for miscarriage, preterm or operative delivery were not increased. Cold-coagulation of CIN 3 at 100 degrees C as performed by us is as effective as any other treatment and calls into question the need for more expensive practices.\r"

Smears were compared with respect to the presence of cytological abnormality and two types of normal cervical epithelial cells (endocervical and immature metaplastic cells) which are considered indicators of adequate cytological sampling. Smears taken with the Rocket spatula were significantly less likely to contain immature metaplastic cells (95% CI on difference in proportion; 5-30%), but more likely to contain endocervical cells (95% CI 16-36%). No significant difference was found in the proportion of smears containing one or other type of indicator cell or in the yield of abnormal smears. It is concluded that the Rocket spatula offered no advantage when used in these circumstances. This study illustrates how spurious conclusions of sampling efficacy can be drawn if only one type of indicator cell is used as an endpoint.\r"

CIN 3 was the histological diagnosis most often associated with vaginal lesions. The upper vagina was almost always involved. In 67% the lesion in the cervix appeared to be confluent with that in the vagina. Even when the lesions were confluent, biopsies form the cervical and vaginal components did not always show the same grade of intraepithelial neoplasia and in some biopsies they showed different lesions. Laser treatment appears to be effective for the vaginal lesions and is therefore recommended although, in selected patients, careful follow up alone may suffice.\r"

The average recorded fetal oxygen saturation in early labour (cervical dilatation less than 5 cm) was 68% (SD 13%). At the end of labour (cervical dilatation greater than or equal to 9 cm) the recorded mean oxygen saturation was 58% (SD 17%). The largest range of readings during a single labour was 81%-11% but this drop was associated with cord compression. The average SD during 1 h of normal labour was 10%. A second group of 40 fetuses was monitored during induction of labour before and after elective amniotomy. Oxygen saturation did not appear to change after amniotomy (mean change -0.4%, SD 1.2%) and there was no difference between mean antenatal or early intrapartum readings. We excluded the amniochorionic membranes as a possible source of data corruption by measuring their in vitro absorption spectra and confirming that they do not preferentially absorb light of either 660 or 940 nm wavelength. Non-invasive pulse oximetry can be used to monitor the fetus before and during labour.\r"

We assessed the occurrence of decompensated and compensated DIC (using predefined criteria) in 15 consecutive nulliparous pregnant patients with gestational hypertension combined with the HELLP syndrome and in 12 consecutive nulliparous controls with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) but without the HELLP syndrome. A combination of routine coagulation assays revealed the absence of decompensated DIC in all studied patients. However, using more specific and sensitive coagulation assays, compensated DIC was observed in all HELLP patients and in three patients in the control group. The mean values of antithrombin III, thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and protein C in the HELLP and the control group were 66 vs 87% (P = 0.0004), 21 vs 8 ng/ml (P = 0.0008) and 57 vs 90% (P = 0.0018) respectively. We conclude that HELLP patients show evidence of compensated DIC which may have pathophysiological significance for the observed organ damage.\r"

The time of the luteinizing hormone surge or hCG administration was known for all of them. There was no difference in CRL between the different infertility treatment groups. CRL measurements from this and a similar study where gestational age had been based on the time of ovulation were compared with the CRL measurements from pregnancies where the gestational age had been calculated from the last menstrual period. The CRL was found to be generally smaller in the studies based on ovulation timing and the difference was statistically significant at one time point. This suggests that there is a need for a gold standard in obstetric ultrasound, measurements being based on the gestational age as calculated from the unequivocal date of conception, rather than the last menstrual period.\r"

Samples from 40 pregnancies associated with anencephaly, 47 pregnancies associated with open spina bifida or encephalocele and six pregnancies with fetal intrauterine death or miscarriage all had ratios of greater than 0.14. All 11 pregnancies with fetal ventral wall defects had ratios less than 0.14 as had four pregnancies with normal outcome and elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase. Three fetuses with both open spina bifida and ventral wall defects were associated with ratios above 0.14. These results suggest that immunochemical determination of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase can be used to distinguish pregnancies complicated by anencephaly, open spina bifida, encephalocele and miscarriage from those with ventral wall defects and samples with false positive elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase. The procedure is accurate and simple to carry out and well suited to routine use in a clinical chemistry laboratory.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To establish the prevalence of babies born before arrival at two local hospitals. To identify women at risk of giving birth before arrival, and the morbidity and mortality associated with such births. DESIGN--A case control study. Each baby born before arrival and its mother were compared with the next born in the hospital (random control), and one matched for gestation and birthweight, together with their mothers. SETTING--Two maternity units serving East Birmingham and Solihull. SUBJECTS--All babies (and their mothers) born before arrival at these hospitals from January 1983 to December 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Perinatal mortality rates, patterns of perinatal morbidity, demographic, social and obstetric features of the mothers. RESULTS--137 (0.44%) of 31,140 consecutive births were before arrival at hospital (BBA group). The perinatal mortality rate in the BBA group was 58.4/1000 (8 deaths) compared with 10.1/1000 for all inborn babies (relative risk 5.8, 95% confidence interval 2.9-11.4). In the BBA group the mean birthweight of 3008 g was 212 g (95% CI 50-374 g) less than that in the random control group; the mean gestation of 266 days was 10 days less (95% CI 5.9-14.1 days) than in the random control group. Hypothermia was the commonest morbidity. Women delivered before arrival tended to be either multigravid inner city Asians living a long way from the hospital or unmarried unbooked younger white Europeans. CONCLUSIONS--The high perinatal mortality was related to immaturity and low birthweight, rather than to birth before arrival itself. Although groups of mothers at risk of delivery before arrival can be identified more information is needed to establish whether additional antenatal care would be beneficial for these women and their babies.\r"

There was a positive correlation (P less than 0.001) between cord serum thiocyanate (SCN) concentrations used as an index of maternal smoking and the maternal smoking habits. The thyroid volume/birthweight ratio increased significantly as a function of SCN values (P less than 0.005): this increase was secondary to a decrease in birthweight as well as to an increase in thyroid volume. There was also a positive correlation between cord serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and SCN levels (P = 0.001). Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) values remained within the normal range for age in all newborn infants and were not significantly correlated with SCN values. These results show that smoking during pregnancy in areas with borderline iodine intake may be a significant cause of thyroid enlargement in the newborn.\r"

An indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique was used. All of the tumours were positive for EMA and CAM 5.2, and 30% of them were positive for both CEA and DD9. The absence of CEA and DD9 may be of value in differentiating between metastatic abdominal adenocarcinomas of ovarian origin and those of gastrointestinal origin, but no indication of prognosis was obtained using these epithelial markers. The strong and widespread staining of all the tumours for EMA suggests that this may be a useful marker for detecting metastatic or recurrent disease by immunoscintigraphy.\r"

There were 103 women in the study group and 105 in the control group. At the end of the study a further 104 women were recruited for ECV. INTERVENTION--ECV attempted after intravenous injection of 10 micrograms of hexaprenaline, using either forward or backward somersault over a maximum period of 5 min. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Success rate in terms of presentation during labour, need for caesarean section, and various variables related to fetal outcome. RESULTS--ECV reduced the frequency of breech presentation during labour from 83% to 17% and that of caesarean section from 33% to 13%. There were no troublesome complications from the procedure. CONCLUSION--In carefully selected women with breech presentation, ECV at term using tocolysis, safely reduced the rate of breech presentation in labour and also the caesarean section rate. Further research is needed to determine the role of ECV in early labour.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE-To determine if a policy of early amniotomy resulted in a reduction in mean labour duration when compared to a policy of conservation of the membranes. DESIGN-A single-centre randomized controlled trial. SETTING-A tertiary care teaching hospital in Alberta, Canada. SUBJECTS-Ninety-seven term nulliparae in spontaneous labour, baby in cephalic presentation. INTERVENTION-Early amniotomy versus intent to keep membranes intact. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES-Interval from randomization to delivery, rate of abnormalities of fetal heart rate tracings, cord artery blood pH, Apgar scores. RESULTS-The mean interval from randomization to delivery was 390.9 (SE 29.1) min in the amniotomy group and 442.9 (SE 34.1) min in the control group (P = 0.251). There were no differences between groups in the occurrence of fetal heart rate tracing abnormalities, nor was there a difference in the proportion of babies with abnormal Apgar scores, or abnormal cord pH (less than 7.20). CONCLUSION-The results of the study fail to support the long held belief that early amniotomy is an effective method for reducing labour duration.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study the changes in morbidity, mortality, and survival patterns in a population of patients with AIDS in the United Kingdom from 1982 to 1989. DESIGN--A retrospective analysis of inpatient and outpatient records of patients with AIDS. SUBJECTS--347 Patients with AIDS, predominantly homosexual or bisexual men. SETTING--Departments of immunology and genitourinary medicine, St Mary's Hospital, London. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presenting diagnosis of AIDS, occurrence of other opportunist diseases, cause of death, and survival since AIDS was diagnosed, in particular for those patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or Kaposi's sarcoma. RESULTS--The overall proportion of patients who developed P carinii pneumonia dropped from 56% (20/36) in 1984 to 24% (46/194) in 1989, although it has remained the index diagnosis in about half of new patients. Kaposi's sarcoma has decreased as index diagnosis from 30% (20/67) to 20% (15/74) over the same period, though the prevalence has remained constant at around 35%. P carinii pneumonia accounted for 46% (16/35) of known causes of death in 1986 but only 3% (1/31) in 1989. Conversely, deaths due to Kaposi's sarcoma rose from 14% (1/7) to 32% (10/31) between 1984 and 1989. Lymphoma accounted for an increased proportion of deaths among these patients with 16% (5/31) of deaths in 1989. Their median survival increased from 10 months in 1984-6 to 20 months in 1987. CONCLUSIONS--The changing patterns of disease in patients with AIDS have important implications both for health care provision and future medical research. Medical and nursing provision must be made for the increased morbidity of these diseases and the increased survival of these patients. Research should now be directed towards developing effective treatments for the opportunist infections which are currently more difficult to treat, the secondary malignancies of AIDS, as well as more effective immunorestorative treatments. Future changes in disease patterns must be recognised at an early stage so that resources can be adequately planned and allocated.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To describe the characteristics of patients using non-orthodox health care and their pattern of use of conventional health care with respect to a particular problem. DESIGN--Postal survey of all 2152 practitioners of acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, and osteopathy identified from 11 national professional association registers. Patients attending a representative sample of 101 responding practitioners completed questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, presenting problems, and use of the health service. SETTING--Practices of practitioners of non-orthodox health care in England, Scotland, and Wales. SUBJECTS--Qualified, non-medical practitioners of non-orthodox health care working in Great Britain and 2473 patients who had attended one of the sampled practitioners in an allocated time period between August 1987 and July 1988. RESULTS--An estimated 1909 practitioners were actively practising one of the study treatments in Great Britain in 1987. Of the estimated 70,600 patients seen by this group of practitioners in an average week, most (78%) were attending with a musculoskeletal problem. Two thirds of the patients were women. Only 2% were aged under 16, but 15% were aged 65 or over. One in three patients had not received previous conventional care for their main problem; 18% were receiving concurrent non-orthodox and conventional care. Twenty two per cent of the patients reported having seen their general practitioner for any reason in the two weeks before the surveyed consultation. CONCLUSIONS--Patients of non-orthodox health care, as provided by this group of practitioners, had not turned their backs on conventional health care. Non-orthodox treatment was sought for a limited range of problems and used most frequently as a supplement to orthodox medicine.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised study of diabetic patients with microalbuminuria treated with perindopril or nifedipine for 12 months and monitored for one or three months after stopping treatment depending on whether they were hypertensive or normotensive. Patients were randomised separately according to whether they were hypertensive or normotensive. SETTING--Diabetic clinics in three university teaching hospitals. PATIENTS--50 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria. In all, 43 completed the study: 30 were normotensive and 13 hypertensive; 19 had type I diabetes and 24 had type II diabetes. INTERVENTIONS--For 12 months 20 patients were given perindopril 2-8 mg daily and 23 were given nifedipine 20-80 mg daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS--Both perindopril and nifedipine significantly reduced mean blood pressure. During treatment there was no significant difference between those treated with perindopril and those treated with nifedipine with respect to albuminuria or mean blood pressure. Stopping treatment with both drugs was associated with a sustained increase in albuminuria and mean blood pressure. There was a significant correlation between mean blood pressure and albuminuria and also between the reduction in mean blood pressure and the decrease in albuminuria during treatment with both drugs. In hypertensive patients both drugs caused significant decreases in mean blood pressure and albuminuria. In normotensive patients there was no significant reduction in albuminuria with either regimen. CONCLUSIONS--In diabetic patients with microalbuminuria blood pressure seems to be an important determinant of urinary albumin excretion. Perindopril and nifedipine have similar effects on urinary albumin excretion, both preventing increases in albuminuria in normotensive patients and decreasing albuminuria in hypertensive patients.\r"

SETTING--Health survey by screening teams from the national health screening service, and examinations by all 106 general practitioners in the county. SUBJECTS--During 1984-6, 74,977 persons (88.1% of those aged 20 years and over) participated in the health survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Hypertension (when assessed by standardised recording and by questionnaires on drug treatment for hypertension) according to the blood pressure thresholds used in the Norwegian treatment programme. Subjects positive on screening were grouped after clinical examination into treatment groups. RESULTS--In all, 2399 subjects were positive for hypertension. Before screening 6210 (8.3%) patients reported taking antihypertensive drugs and another 3849 (5.1%) had their blood pressure monitored regularly. All who screened positive were referred to their general practitioner and evaluated according to a standard programme. As a result, drug treatment was started in 406 (0.5%) participants screened and blood pressure monitoring in another 1007 (1.3%). Of all patients taking antihypertensive drugs after the screening, 6399 (94.0%) had been diagnosed before screening, and of those whose blood pressure was monitored after the screening, 79.3% had been diagnosed before screening. CONCLUSIONS--At the blood pressure screening thresholds used, and when hypertension is defined by an overall clinical diagnosis, the results indicate that general practitioners can find and diagnose hypertensive patients with the case finding strategy.\r"

To assess the numbers of volunteers and patients exposed to a new active substance when marketing autorisation is first sought. DESIGN AND SETTING--Observational study of records for each licence application submitted to the United Kingdom licensing authority for marketing authorisation from 1987 to 1989. SUBJECTS--118 product licence applications containing one or more new active substances. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Success of application for product licence as assessed by the decision of the Committee on Safety of Medicines to advise the granting of a licence (with or without conditions) or provisionally advise its refusal on the grounds of quality, safety, or efficacy. Assessment of numbers of volunteers and patients exposed to each substance during premarketing studies and clinical trials, and the numbers of treated patients available for an assessment of safety. RESULTS--118 relevant product licence applications were submitted during the review. Although 60% (52/86) of semi-innovative products fell into one of three therapeutic categories (cardiovascular, central nervous system, or anti-infective agents), only 41% (13/32) of fully innovative products fell into these categories. 47 applications were granted (conditionally or unconditionally) but the success rate for fully innovative products (56%, 18/32) was greater than that for semi-innovative products (34%, 29/86). The number of volunteers and patients exposed to a new product at submission varied widely and tended to be greater for successful applications. CONCLUSION--The results suggest a broadening of the pharmaceutical industry's research and development programmes and that a more liberal licensing policy exists for fully innovative products than for semi-innovative products. The relatively limited exposure of patients to new active substances at licensing underlines the importance of rigorous postmarketing surveillance.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To evaluate whether hormone replacement therapy affects survival in women who have undergone bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy because of epithelial ovarian cancer. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis by review of patients' notes and questionnaires completed by general practitioners to compare the overall survival and disease free survival in patients with ovarian cancer who did or did not receive hormone replacement therapy after diagnosis. Data were analysed by Cox regression, with hormone replacement therapy as a time dependent covariate because patients who received hormone replacement did so at different times after diagnosis. SETTING--Gynaecological oncology unit of Royal Marsden Hospital. PATIENTS--373 patients aged 50 years or younger who attended the hospital from 1972 to 1988. All of the women had undergone bilateral salpingoophorectomy for epithelial ovarian cancer. In all, 78 had received hormone replacement therapy, starting at a median of four months after diagnosis. INTERVENTION--A questionnaire was sent to the general practitioners of all patients who were not recorded as having received hormone replacement therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Overall survival and disease free survival. RESULTS--There was no significant difference in survival between women receiving hormone replacement therapy and those not receiving it after accounting for the effects of other known prognostic factors (stage of cancer, differentiation of tumour, histological results, and time to relapse). The relative risk of dying in those who received hormone replacement therapy was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.20). In addition, there was no significant difference in disease free survival (relative risk in those receiving hormone replacement therapy was 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 1.54). CONCLUSIONS--This study shows that hormone replacement therapy is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer, but this would be shown conclusively only by a randomised controlled trial.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether in a patient with spontaneous pneumothorax the presence or absence of a pleural leak can be shown at the time of manual aspiration by use of a marker gas. Also, to find out if the technique can predict whether manual aspiration will be successful, hence avoiding the need for intercostal tube drainage. DESIGN--Prospective study of 25 episodes of pneumothorax during which patients breathed air from a Douglas bag that contained chlorofluorocarbon gases from a metered dose inhaler while the pneumothorax was aspirated. SETTING--Medical unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS--22 patients who presented over nine months with acute pneumothorax. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence or absence of chlorofluorocarbon marker gases in the aspirate. Presence or absence of sustained re-expansion of the affected lung in the chest radiograph. RESULTS--Marker gas was detected in the aspirate from 16 out of 25 pneumothoraces. Of these, 13 required intercostal tube drainage because of failure of the lung to re-expand. Marker gas was not detected in nine cases, and in all of these cases manual aspiration resulted in sustained re-expansion of the lung. CONCLUSIONS--The presence or absence of a pleural leak during manual aspiration of spontaneous pneumothorax can be shown by using this technique. The absence of marker gas in the aspirate implies that manual aspiration will be successful, whereas its presence predicts, in most cases, either failure of manual aspiration to expand the lung or early re-collapse of the lung.\r"

DESIGN--A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of a biologically standardised depot grass pollen extract. SETTING--Allergy clinic, Royal Brompton and National Heart Hospital, London. PATIENTS--40 adults (mean age 35 years) with a history of severe grass pollen allergy uncontrolled by standard antiallergic drugs. Patients with perennial asthma were specifically excluded. INTERVENTION--Patients were randomised to receive either an active preparation (Alutard SQ, a grass pollen (Phleum pratense) extract) or placebo at a rate of two subcutaneous injections a week in increasing doses until a maintenance dose was reached. This maintenance dose was given once a month. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Clinical efficacy was evaluated by symptom and drug diary cards, visual analogue scores during the grass pollen season, and a postseasonal assessment by the patients and a doctor. Conjunctival and skin sensitivity to local allergen provocation was measured before and after eight months of treatment. RESULTS--There was a highly significant decrease (median Alutard SQ v median placebo (95% confidence interval for difference between medians] in total symptom scores (p=0.001) in the Alutard SQ treated group (360 v 928 (238 to 825]. Significant differences were also found in total drug use (p=0.002, 129 v 627 (178 to 574]. Visual analogue symptom scores were also reduced in the active group (p=0.02, 2.2 v 5.5 (-4.8 to -0.5]. The postseasonal assessment, by either the doctor or the patients, showed a large improvement (p less than 0.001) in favour of Alutard SQ. Provocation tests showed a greater than 10-fold reduction for the active group in immediate conjunctival allergen sensitivity (p=0.001), a 40% decrease in early phase response (p=0.02), and a 57% decrease in the late phase (p=0.001) cutaneous response after intradermal allergen. A total of 523 active injections were given. There was one systemic reaction at 10 minutes after injection, which was rapidly reversed with intramuscular adrenaline. There was one mild delayed urticarial reaction at 2 1/2 hours. CONCLUSION--Immunotherapy is effective in patients with severe summer hay fever, but immediate anaphylactic reactions limit its use to specialised centres. Patient selection is extremely important, and chronic perennial asthma should be specifically excluded. As serious reactions occur within minutes a two hour wait for all patients after each injection seems unnecessary.\r"

SETTING--Family planning centre in London. SUBJECTS--24 women aged 35-45 investigated before, during, and after six months' use of combined oral contraceptives containing 30 micrograms ethinyl oestradiol together with the progestogens desogestrel or gestodene. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Blood samples were taken immediately before and after six months of oral contraceptive use and one, two, four, six, eight, and 12 weeks after the pill had been stopped. During the six months of oral contraceptive use the plasma concentration of factor X and fibrinogen increased and that of antithrombin III decreased. Between two and six weeks after stopping the pill a rebound phenomenon occurred with plasma concentrations of antithrombin III increasing (mean change from baseline at two weeks 0.06 IU/l and at six weeks 0.10 IU/l) and fibrinogen decreasing (0.26 g/l change at two weeks and 0.40 g/l at six weeks). Factor X concentrations fell gradually and the values at eight weeks were not significantly different from those found before the combined pill was started. CONCLUSION--The combined pill should be stopped at least four weeks before major surgery, which carries the risk of postoperative thrombosis, to allow the potentially prothrombotic haemostatic changes that occur during its use to be corrected.\r"

SETTING--9 General practices in the Oxford area. SUBJECTS--416 Women who had 572 consultations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age, menopausal state, and first or subsequent consultation. Symptoms were classified together with the treatment and the outcome of the consultation. RESULTS--The consultation rate varied greatly between practices, the overall rate being 4.4%. There were many premenopausal women and women in their 60s presenting; women with hysterectomies presented more often--36% (37/103) of women with hysterectomies had more than one consultation compared with 26% (38/144) for premenopausal women and 24% (38/155) for postmenopausal women. 409 women had symptoms and 218 were prescribed oestrogen treatment. 156 of the consultations involved discussion and advice only. Only four women were referred to a local specialist clinic. CONCLUSION--There is a low overall use of hormone replacement therapy in the general postmenopausal population despite the recent media coverage of its benefits in the prevention of osteoporosis and subsequent fractures.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To describe a nosocomial outbreak of cryptosporidiosis during four months after June 1989. SETTING--A department of infectious diseases in Copenhagen, seeing about half the patients with AIDS in Denmark. SUBJECTS--73 HIV antibody negative subjects and 60 antibody positive subjects admitted as inpatients during the transmission period of the outbreak (20 June-14 August), of whom 18 (17 with AIDS, one with AIDS related complex), developed cryptosporidiosis. Two further HIV negative subjects (one departmental secretary, one visiting relative) developed cryptosporidiosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cryptosporidia in stool samples, clinical symptoms, CD4 cell count, HIV antigen concentration, chemotherapeutic treatment. RESULTS--The source of the outbreak was identified as ice from an ice machine in the ward, contaminated by an incontinent, psychotic patient with cryptosporidiosis picking out ice for cold drinks. The mean incubation time was at least 13 days-that is, twice that in HIV-negative patients. Of the 18 patients with AIDS who developed cryptosporidiosis, five recovered, two were symptomless carriers, three died of unrelated causes, and eight died after prolonged diarrhoea. Among the 57 exposed HIV antibody positive inpatients (excluding two patients and the index case with cryptosporidiosis diagnosed elsewhere), significantly more of those who developed symptomatic cryptosporidiosis received oral sulphonamides than those who did not (91%, 10/11 v 48%, 21/44, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--The clinical and epidemiological findings indicate that infection was the consequence of very small inocula. Increased sensitivity to cryptosporidiosis may be an unrecognised side effect of oral sulphonamide treatment in patients with AIDS.\r"

Six scans were negative and seven uninterpretable. Of the remaining 37 patients, 34 had correct scan prediction of the anatomical locations of the adenomas. On examination of the origins of the adenomas, all six scintigraphic predictions of upper adenomas corresponded to tumours arising from the upper gland found at operation. Of the 25 lower predictions, there was one false positive and 16 were correct, i.e. of lower gland origin, but eight were found to originate from the upper gland. This misinterpretation is though to be due to the prolapse of an adenoma arising from the upper gland towards the lower pole of the thyroid, thereby mimicking a lower lesion on the scan.\r"

The subjects received no antiperistaltic medication and were allowed to breath normally during the three acquisition periods of 11 minutes. The frequency of demonstration of the normal aorta, superior mesenteric and right and left renal arteries was 100%/100%/91%/100%, and of the inferior vena cava, splenic, superior mesenteric and portal veins was 92%/67%/92%/100%, respectively, whereas other abdominal vessels were seen less constantly. In renal artery stenosis or occlusion, MRA detected eight out of nine pathological arteries, missed only a minimal stenosis and was never false positive. In all 10 cases of portal hypertension, MRA demonstrated the venous collaterals detected by conventional angiography and in six cases showed more collaterals, particularly paravertebral vessels. A Budd-Chiari syndrome was investigated as well. If the accuracy of MRA can be proved in larger studies, it may become an important diagnostic tool in evaluating abdominal vascular pathology, such as renal artery stenosis or portal hypertension.\r"

A prospective series of 50 patients presenting with a clinically suspected RIF mass was examined by US and the finding correlated with the final diagnosis. There was a positive finding in 34 patients (68%). Ultrasound correctly identified the organ of origin in 33 (97%) and was able to guide the patients' further management. In 12 cases no abnormality was found in the RIF, of which 11 had no positive findings at follow-up and one was shown to have an unrelated abnormality at laparotomy. In four cases the findings were due to normal variants. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of first choice in patients presenting with a RIF mass.\r"

It was found that the CT scanners currently available give quite different organ or tissue doses. When selecting the optimum technical factors for scanning, therefore, it is important to take into consideration the balance of the image quality and the radiation exposure to patients.\r"

We have adopted a working hypothesis that regression slopes reflect the composition of individual tumours and, indirectly, their intrinsic growth rate rather than the effectiveness of treatment. The breast has proved to be a suitable site for measurement and our interpretation of the results has led to the development of a new style of management for carcinoma of the breast: measurement based sequential therapy (MBST). In this paper the method of measurement and detailed statistical evaluation of the quality of the data from 262 patients (263 tumours) is presented. Exponential regression lines have been fitted to describe volume changes in relation to treatment by radiation, chemotherapy and hormones. A simple classification of steepness of slopes is introduced.\r"

  ".W": "We report uptake of a thymidine analogue 125-Iodine-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (125IUdR) by nude mice bearing human xenografts of choriocarcinoma or colonic cancer. When 125IUdR was given alone, uptake by intestinal tissues was 5-10 times greater than by the tumours as measured by tissue gamma counting. This ratio was reversed when hydroxyurea or cytosine arabinoside were used as inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase and were given in combination with 5-fluorouracil or methotrexate to inhibit thymidine synthesis shortly before injecting 125IUdR. Counting the radioactivity in tissues removed 24 hours after 125IUdR gave tumour to highest normal tissue ratios of up to 15:1, but the corresponding nuclear grain counts, which is probably a more reliable indicator of selective uptake into DNA, were in excess of 100:1. The addition of unlabelled IUdR to the regimen only reduced the uptake of 125IUdR when given in relatively large amounts. For this approach to be exploited it is concluded that the tumour must be resistant at the cell level to the inhibitor of DNA synthesis either de novo or as a result of prior exposure to it. This inhibitor can then be used to block uptake of the potentially toxic nucleoside analogue by normal renewal tissues while it is taken up by the resistant cancer cells. By inhibiting synthesis of the corresponding normal nucleosides with inhibitors to which the cancer cells are not resistant, incorporation of the toxic analogues into tumour DNA was enhanced. Although 125IUdR is a convenient agent for exploring this approach and is highly cytotoxic when incorporated in DNA, the clinical potential of reverse role chemotherapy probably lies with the development of toxic non-radioactive nucleoside analogues.\r"

  ".U": "91152396\r", 
  ".W": "For the purposes of evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the radiohalogenated thymidine analogue 125IUdR, estimation of the radiation dose to the tumour cells and normal tissues is important. To determine the dose to any tissue from the radionuclide 125I is not simple, since the major emissions are very short-range Auger electrons. The cytotoxicity of 125I is strongly dependent on the position of the decay relative to the DNA, the principal target for cell sterilization. Estimates of the cytotoxicity of 125I based on the traditional MIRD recommended formulation (ICRU Report 32, 1979) may produce gross underestimates if it is incorporated into the DNA via the thymidine precursor 125IUdR. In this work, tissue count and autoradiography (ARG) data from studies by Bagshawe et al were used to estimate tissue doses following the administration of 125IUdR to LS174/T (a colorectal carcinoma) and CC3 (a choriocarcinoma) tumour-bearing animals, after a hydroxyurea block of the normal tissue turnover. The tumour cell toxicity is estimated from ARG data on the degree of 125I incorporation into the cell nucleus. Major drawbacks with 125I for this type of therapy are the long 60-day half-life, leading to radiological and waste disposal problems and the extreme short range of the radiotoxic effects. Possible alternative radiohalogens, 13I, 77Br, 131I and 211At, are suggested in place of 125I in the thymidine analog iododeoxyuridine. Dose calculations are performed and cytotoxicities estimated on the assumption that their biological retention characteristics are the same as for 125IUdR.\r"

A correlation was found between complication rate and age. This relationship was independent of the approach to, the position of, and the severity of the treated lesion.

The response characterized by an initial fall followed by a prolonged increase in RVR on discontinuation of the iothalamate infusion. No significant change in RVR was observed when iothalamate was infused as an iso-osmotic solution (60 mgI/ml, 280 mOsmol/kg/H2O) at a rate of 0.525 ml/min. to produce a concentration of 4.2 mgI/ml in the renal perfusate. We conclude that sodium iothalamate can exert direct biphasic effects on RVR which are mediated by its hyperosmolality rather than its chemical content.\r"

This risk is exacerbated by the fibrinolytic shutdown which is known to occur after major surgery. Stanozolol, which has been demonstrated to enhance endogenous fibrinolysis, was therefore used in an attempt to prevent this perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown and so enhance graft patency. Twenty-seven patients were randomized to receive either 50 mg stanozolol or placebo intramuscularly 24 h before operation, followed by a 6 week course of either 5 mg stanozolol or placebo orally, twice daily. On the second day after operation, 10-11 MBq of autologous 111indium-labelled platelets were injected, with scanning over the graft on the 3 following days. Despite using a large depot of stanozolol, significant effects, such as raised plasminogen (P less than 0.001), reduced fibrinogen (P less than 0.001) and reduced euglobulin lysis time (P less than 0.001), were not seen until the seventh day after operation, with maximum benefit at 6 weeks. This was reflected in the 111indium-labelled platelet deposition studies. The placebo group had a progressive increase in platelet deposition on all 3 days. In contrast, those receiving stanozolol showed a lower, static picture of deposition. However, these changes did not attain statistical significance. Three patients experienced early graft thrombosis, two in the placebo group and one in the stanozolol group. Only an incomplete inhibition of the perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown was achieved. Much longer preoperative courses are thus required to allow the maximum effect to be present at the most crucial time. At present, perioperative fibrinolytic enhancement does not appear to be a practical proposition, and we must await the development of new safer and more potent agents.\r"

In the clinical abscess cavities, phenytoin application in 20 patients compared with conventional treatment in 20 patients resulted in earlier separation of slough, decrease in oedema, control of pain and overall enhanced healing. The mean(s.d.) rate of reduction of wound area was 2.02(0.48) cm2/day in the phenytoin group versus 1.58(0.51) cm2/day in controls (P less than 0.05) on day 10, and 1.8(0.32) cm2/day versus 1.19(0.21) cm2/day (P less than 0.01) on day 20. The mean volume reduction rates at both the 10th and 20th day were 0.48(0.01) cm3/day for phenytoin versus 0.32(0.04) cm3/day for controls; (P less than 0.005). By day 20, 17 of the patients treated with phenytoin were rated as having healed completely, compared with only one of the controls. In a standardized guinea-pig model of the clinical abscess cavity, which included inoculation of the wound with Bacillus proteus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, an enhanced healing rate was also observed (at 7 days 0.40(0.05) cm2/day with phenytoin versus 0.21(0.08) cm2/day in controls; P less than 0.005). All eight of the animals treated with phenytoin healed by day 21, compared with one of the eight controls. Biopsies of wounds treated with phenytoin showed less inflammation, no necrosis, and enhanced neovascularization, collagen deposition and fibroblast proliferation compared to controls. Bacterial colonies also decreased more rapidly with the use of phenytoin.\r"

Electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded by surface electrodes during sustained isotonic and isometric muscle contraction with a constant force of 20 per cent of the preoperative maximal voluntary contraction. Root-mean-square of the EMG was calculated together with the neuromuscular efficiency and measures of the fatiguability. These parameters were compared with changes in the simultaneously measured serum phosphate concentrations. Mean (s.e.m.) neuromuscular efficiency measured after 32-40 s of muscle contraction decreased 14(5) per cent after operation (P less than 0.01), whereas the mean fatiguability of the muscle was unchanged. Mean serum phosphate concentration was 0.87(0.06) mmol/l before operation and 0.79(0.06) mmol/l 3 days after the operation (P greater than 0.05). Two patients developed severe postoperative hypophosphataemia (serum phosphate concentration less than 0.50 mmol/l). Postoperative muscle function deterioration was not associated with changes in the serum phosphate level (P greater than 0.10; r = 0.03). We conclude that patients undergoing cholecystectomy develop postoperative deterioration in skeletal muscle function, which is not associated with serum phosphate concentration.\r"

The importance of the omentum in the development of tumours at sites of intra-abdominal trauma has been investigated. Colonic anastomoses were performed in Hooded-Lister rats with and without omentectomy. Animals received intraluminal or intraperitoneal injections of a syngeneic tumour. With intraluminal injection, tumour occurred at the anastomosis and in the omentum in 38 and 43 per cent of animals respectively but following omentectomy the values were 14 and 9 per cent (omental remnant). With intraperitoneal administration tumour occurred in 53 per cent at the anastomosis and in 79 per cent in the omentum compared with 16 and 29 per cent (in omental remnant) following omentectomy. In this model a reduced ability of an anastomosis to support 'seeded' tumour following removal of the omentum is demonstrated and the development of local recurrence from spilled tumour cells during operation may be enhanced by, or be dependent on, the proximity of the omentum.\r"

  ".W": "From August 1969 to December 1989, 600 patients had elective proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulceration with an operative mortality of 0.2 per cent. Of these, 372 patients had surgery over 10 years ago. Three hundred and forty-two patients survived for more than 10 years and, in a prospective study, 305 were reviewed, forming the basis of this 10-20-year follow-up report. Forty-six (15 per cent) have had recurrent ulceration; 80 per cent of these developed symptoms within 5 years and no patient has had recurrence after 13 years. Although 29 patients required reoperation for recurrent ulceration, the current patient satisfaction rate for Visick grades I and II is 92 per cent. Only two patients required reoperation because of gastric stasis. It is concluded that proximal gastric vagotomy is a safe and satisfactory first choice operation for duodenal ulceration.\r"

  ".W": "Gastric adaptive relaxation is reported to be impaired after vagotomy. This abnormality has been implicated in the pathogenesis of postvagotomy symptoms, but no association has previously been demonstrated between the two. Gastric adaptive relaxation was measured in 15 healthy volunteers and 33 patients more than 1 year after highly selective vagotomy or truncal vagotomy and drainage. Seventeen patients were asymptomatic. The remainder were symptomatic including seven patients with persistent diarrhoea. Fasted subjects were intubated with a Ryle's tube containing a pressure microtransducer within a flaccid (800 ml) plastic bag. Gastric corpus-fundus pressure was recorded during distension of the bag with air (15 ml/s) over 30 s. Pressure indices were derived from the areas under the pressure curves. Median (range) pressure indices were: healthy volunteers 12.7 (7.5-17.1) cmH2O, highly selective vagotomy 14.0 (9.8-15.9) cmH2O (n.s.), truncal vagotomy and drainage 14.5 (8.6-26.8) cmH2O (P = 0.04). All patients with diarrhoea had abnormally high pressure indices (P less than 0.001). Pressure indices in all other patient groups were within the normal range. We conclude that gastric adaptive relaxation remains abnormal in patients with postvagotomy diarrhoea but not in those who are asymptomatic or who have other symptoms.\r"

There was a total of 565 such cases in a population which consisted of 5.2 X 10(5) individuals in 1972 and 4.8 X 10(5) individuals in 1987. The introduction of H2-receptor antagonists in 1979 was associated with a fall in the annual incidence of elective duodenal ulcer operations, from 15.5 to 6.7 per 10(5) individuals, and a fall in the annual incidence of elective gastric ulcer operations, from 9.4 to 3.1 per 10(5) individuals (P less than 0.05). The decrease was greatest among males with duodenal ulcer. In contrast, the annual incidence of emergency surgery for ulcer haemorrhage and perforation (all types of ulcers) remained relatively stable, varying from 7.2 to 10.2 per 10(5) inhabitants over the observation period (n.s.). The mean age of patients undergoing elective surgery remained essentially unchanged. The mean age of patients undergoing emergency surgery increased. The decrease in the annual incidence of elective duodenal ulcer surgery occurred mainly in relation to proximal gastric vagotomy. There was a concomitant relative increase in the incidence of gastric resection. The types of operative procedures used in cases of pyloric, prepyloric and gastric ulcer remained unchanged over the years 1972 to 1987.\r"

A near-total oesophagectomy with a cervical anastomosis was performed in 93 patients and an oesophagogastrectomy with an intrathoracic anastomosis was carried out in 34 patients. One hundred and eight patients had a curative oesophagectomy and 19 patients had a palliative resection. Eight patients received radiotherapy to the tumour bed. There were 15 deaths in hospital and the overall 5-year survival rate including perioperative deaths was 13.2 per cent. Survival was adversely affected by incomplete excision of macroscopic tumour (P less than 0.001), positive regional lymph nodes (P less than 0.05) and distant lymphatic metastases (P less than 0.02). The 5-year survival rate of patients with tumour invasion beyond the oesophageal wall (T3) and negative nodes was 20 per cent. Postoperative irradiation had no effect on the survival of patients with gross residual tumour. Complete clearance of microscopic tumour was achieved in 50 per cent of patients with T3 tumours and this group did not benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. Survival in patients undergoing curative oesophagectomy with residual microscopic tumour, however, was significantly improved by irradiation of the tumour bed (P less than 0.01). These results suggest that the survival of patients can be increased significantly by the excision of all gross tumour and by identification of those who will benefit from local radiotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "From 112 consecutive hepatectomies for malignant tumours performed with intermittent portal triad clamping, we have retrospectively selected the 20 cases in which clamping exceeded 90 min. Intermittent portal clamping of prolonged duration was used because of abnormal liver texture in 13 cases (mainly patients who had received intra-arterial chemotherapy) and/or because of technically difficult hepatectomy. The mean(s.d.) duration of intermittent portal clamping was 109(18) min and in two cases it exceeded 140 min (148 and 150 min). There was no postoperative mortality and the rate of postoperative morbidity was 35 per cent. Postoperative changes in biochemical liver tests were not major and transient hepatic failure occurred in only one patient following subtotal resection of the liver. We conclude that intermittent portal clamping is a useful manoeuvre in partial hepatectomy when resection is difficult or prolonged, or when the liver parenchyma is abnormal. Such clamping may be used for longer than 120 min without major complications.\r"

Intraoperative ultrasonography diagnosed more metastases than palpation, abdominal ultrasonography or CT scanning, identifying metastases in 24 of the 26 patients, including six patients in whom the metastases were not detected by any other technique. Identification and localization of impalpable liver metastases is therefore possible using intraoperative ultrasonography.\r"

In order to assess the effect of fibrin glue sealing we compared the healing of sutured colonic anastomosis in the rat (group 1) with the addition of human-derived fibrin sealant (group 2). As a control for a possible reaction to foreign protein, in group 3 the sutured anastomosis was sealed with specially prepared rat fibrin adhesive. On days 2, 4 and 7, ten animals in each group were killed. Adhesion formation was scored and the in situ bursting pressure was measured. The collagen concentration and degradation were estimated by measuring hydroxyproline. Adhesion formation was significantly increased in groups 2 and 3 compared with the control group. On days 2 and 7 the bursting pressure was not different between the groups. On day 4 the bursting pressure in groups 2 and 3 was significantly lower than in group 1 (P less than 0.001). These findings correspond with the results of collagen measurements. On day 4 the concentration of hydroxyproline was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3. Histological examination showed infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes into the sealant on days 2 and 4; on day 7 the sealant had vanished. From these results it is concluded that fibrin sealing of the colonic anastomosis in the rat does not improve healing, as demonstrated by bursting pressure and hydroxyproline concentration. On the contrary, it seems to have a negative influence.\r"

We have investigated the influence of methylprednisolone (2.5 or 10.0 mg kg-1 day-1) given from 2 days before operation onwards, on 3-day-old and 7-day-old ileal and colonic anastomoses in rats. Anastomotic abscesses occurred more frequently in the ileum, but not in the colon, after steroid medication. However, methylprednisolone did not lower anastomotic bursting pressures in either of the bowel segments. Comparison of the hydroxyproline content of the anastomotic segment yielded no significant difference between control and methylprednisolone groups in either small or large bowel. Thus, healing of experimental colonic anastomoses remains unaffected by short-term administration of this corticosteroid.\r"

When applied to the peritoneal cavity immediately after surgery, it is important to know the optimum temperature, and to investigate the subsequent healing of intestinal anastomoses. To study the first problem, local hyperthermia was applied to the intestinal loop of rats for 30 min. Treatment at 46.0 degrees C or 45.0 degrees C resulted in 100 per cent and 90 per cent mortality respectively, but 100 per cent survival was obtained at 44.0 degrees C. To study the second problem rats with intestinal anastomoses were studied in three groups: group A, local hyperthermia (44.0 degrees C x 30 min) applied to the intestinal loop containing the anastomosis; group B, local hyperthermia (44.0 degrees C x 30 min) applied using saline supplemented with mytomycin C (10 mg/l); group C (controls) no thermal treatment was applied. Anastomotic healing was assessed by breaking strength and histological examination. On the third day after operation, the breaking strength of anastomoses decreased to the lowest values in each group, but no statistically significant differences were noted. On the seventh and 14th day, increased resistance to breaking developed in all three groups and was greatest in the thermally treated groups. Histological findings supported these results. Local hyperthermia up to 44.0 degrees C x 30 min had no adverse effects on the healing of intestinal anastomoses.\r"

Several studies attest to the clinical superiority of this approach over the transabdominal route and recent evidence demonstrates reduced physiological disturbance with this technique. The retroperitoneal approach is suitable for all elective operations on the abdominal aorta, particularly in patients with high-risk aneurysms and in selected patients with symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms.\r"

A total of 97 patients, three with synchronous tumours, consented to receive a single bolus dose of 250 mg between 2.4 and 16 h before curative or palliative surgery. By this method, the ploidy pattern, the total and aneuploid labelling indices (LI), the S phase duration (Ts) and the potential doubling time (Tpot) can be estimated. Of the tumours 48 were diploid and 52 were aneuploid. The mean and median total LI of 100 tumours were 9.0 per cent (range 0.7-22.2 per cent). The mean aneuploid LI was 12.1 per cent (median 12.0 per cent, range 2.0-25.5 per cent), and was significantly higher than the total LI (P = 0.01). The labelling index alone is not a sufficient indicator of proliferation, because the Ts also varies within and between tumours. The intertumour range of the Ts varied from 4.0 to 28.6 h. The mean was 14.1 h and the median was 13.1 h. The mean Tpot was 5.9 days (median 3.9 days) with a range of 1.7-21.4 days. No correlation was found between any kinetic parameters and the Dukes' classification or histological classification. The correlation between proliferation and prognosis will be established in due course.\r"

There were 35 normal vaginal deliveries, 36 forceps deliveries, 20 ventouse extractions, ten vaginal breech deliveries and 21 caesarean sections. Sensation was impaired in the lower, mid and upper anal canal immediately after delivery in those patients who had a normal vaginal delivery or a forceps delivery when compared with controls or with those delivered by caesarean section. Women who had ventouse deliveries had impaired sensation immediately after delivery in the mid anal canal compared with controls and those undergoing caesarean section. By 6 months there were no differences between any group. Patients who sustained a division of the external anal sphincter at delivery had impaired sensation which persisted in the upper anal canal at 6 months.\r"

  ".W": "The peritoneal exudate formed during experimental pancreatitis is toxic when administered intraperitoneally or intravenously to other animals. Overwhelming of the peritoneal antiprotease defences by proteolytic enzymes released from the pancreas may be a key factor responsible for this toxicity and is examined in the current study. Human pancreatitis exudates possessed tryptic amidase activity indicating trypsinogen activation. The trypsin inhibitory capacities of exudates were reduced indicating a degree of consumption of the peritoneal antiproteases. Of 21 exudates examined, three showed marked reduction of their trypsin inhibitory capacity indicating almost complete consumption of their antiproteases. All three patients were shocked at the time of sampling, two dying of fulminant pancreatitis within 24 h. Overwhelming of the peritoneal antiproteases was not confirmed, but may occur in a few instances where proteolytic enzyme release or zymogen activation continues. Intraperitoneal administration of exogenous antiproteases prolongs survival in rats with pancreatitis and has been suggested as a therapy in man. The current data suggests that few patients are likely to benefit from such an approach.\r"

There were 10 (15 per cent) malignant nodules, 11 (16 per cent) benign neoplastic nodules and 47 (69 per cent) benign non-neoplastic nodules. All of the patients with malignant nodules who were scanned had a solitary cold nodule on thyroid scan, as did 40 (69 per cent) of those with benign solitary nodules. Ultrasound examination of the thyroid suggested correctly that one of 16 (6 per cent) cystic lesions, four of 16 (25 per cent) complex solid-cystic lesions and three of 18 (17 per cent) of solid lesions were malignant. One lesion reported as multinodular on ultrasonography and one reported as normal also turned out to be malignant. Thyroid isotope scans and ultrasound do not accurately differentiate between benign and malignant conditions and their routine use in the investigation of a solitary thyroid nodule should be abandoned.\r"

The nuclear DNA content of 65 follicular thyroid neoplasms (52 adenomas and 13 carcinomas) was determined by flow cytometric analysis of paraffin embedded material; in 58 cases preparations were technically satisfactory. In 22 follicular neoplasms DNA analysis was also performed on fresh material obtained by fine needle aspiration of surgical specimens. Cell cycle analysis was performed on both fresh and fixed specimens. An aneuploid DNA profile was found on analysis of fixed tissue in eight of 45 (18 per cent) follicular adenomas and four of 13 (31 per cent) follicular carcinomas. DNA aneuploidy was also found in six of the 22 (27 per cent) fresh preparations from follicular adenomas. The frequency of DNA aneuploidy in apparently benign and malignant follicular neoplasms was similar. Follicular thyroid neoplasia are best regarded as a single entity with a low incidence of local and distant spread. All follicular neoplasia are therefore best excised.\r"

In this paper we address the question of which structures and/or mechanisms may participate in such plastic enhancement by investigating the COR in 2 patients with absent vestibular function and reduced smooth pursuit-optokinetic eye movements (SP-OKN). The patients had multisystem atrophy involving the vestibular system and the cerebellum. The COR (elicited by angular motion of the trunk relative to the fixed head and angular motion of the head relative to the fixed trunk) was not enhanced in these 2 patients when compared with normal subjects, in contrast to previous findings in a group of patients with absent vestibular function alone. Measurements of slow phase eye movement velocity during SP-OKN stimuli and during combined COR-OKN stimulation (head oscillation relative to the stationary trunk in the light) showed identical values in these two conditions, which indicates that the neck-eye loop did not contribute to gaze stability during head movements. The absence of plastic enhancement of the COR in these patients may be secondary to interruption of SP-OKN pathways at various possible sites and/or to involvement of the vestibulocerebellum, which is known to mediate adaptive plasticity in the vestibulo-ocular reflex.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the intercorrelation of 8 'frontal' tests in 32 patients with Korsakoff's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, and examined the relationship of frontal dysfunction to impaired release from proactive interference and impoverished retrieval from retrograde memory. Amongst the frontal tests, there were statistically significant intercorrelations between 3 'fluency' tests and 3 'card-sorting' tests, although the degree of shared variance was relatively low. The relationship of another test--picture arrangement errors--was more equivocal; performance for 'cognitive estimates' was unrelated to performance in the other frontal tests, possibly because it may reflect pathology at a different frontal site. There was no evidence in this study that variability in release from proactive interference was related to measures of frontal function in either patient group, and the conditions under which these patient groups fail to show 'normal' release appear to be tightly constrained. On the other hand, the defective retrieval of retrograde memories was correlated with frontal dysfunction in both patient groups. There was a suggestion of a double dissociation with a measure of nonverbal short-term forgetting, impairment at which was related to the degree of general cortical atrophy rather than frontal dysfunction. A stepwise regression equation based on 3 frontal tests could account for 64% of the variability in retrograde memory performance within the total patient group, 68.5% in the Korsakoff group and 57% in the Alzheimer group. By comparison, the severity of anterograde memory impairment predicted only 21% of the variance in retrograde memory performance. It is concluded that frontal dysfunction produces a disorganization of retrieval processes which contributes to the temporally-extensive retrograde amnesia of these two disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen cases are described, including 12 cases from three different families and 7 nonfamilial cases, in which multisystem neurological disease was associated with acanthocytosis in peripheral blood and normal plasma lipoproteins. Mild acanthocytosis can easily be overlooked, and scanning electron microscopy may be helpful. Some neurologically asymptomatic relatives with significant acanthocytosis were identified during family screening, including some who were clinically affected. The mean age of onset was 32 (range 8-62) yrs and the clinical course was usually progressive but there was marked phenotypic variation. Cognitive impairment, psychiatric features and organic personality change occurred in over half the cases, and more than one-third had seizures. Orofaciolingual involuntary movements and pseudobulbar disturbance commonly caused dysphagia and dysarthria that was sometimes severe, but biting of the lips or tongue was rarely seen. Chorea was seen in almost all symptomatic cases but dystonia, tics, involuntary vocalizations and akinetic-rigid features also occurred. Two cases had no movement disorder at all. Computerized tomography often demonstrated cerebral atrophy. Caudate atrophy was seen less commonly, and nonspecific focal and symmetric signal abnormalities from the caudate or lentiform nuclei were seen by magnetic resonance imaging in 3 out of 4 cases. Depression or absence of tendon reflexes was noted in 13 cases and neurophysiological abnormalities often indicated an axonal neuropathy. Sural nerve biopsies from 3 cases showed evidence of a chronic axonal neuropathy with prominent regenerative activity, predominantly affecting the large diameter myelinated fibres. Serum creatine kinase activity was increased in 11 cases but without clinical evidence of a myopathy. Postmortem neuropathological examination in 1 case revealed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis affecting the corpus striatum, pallidum, and the substantia nigra, especially the pars reticulata. The cerebral cortex appeared spared and the spinal cord showed no evidence of anterior horn cell loss. Two examples of the McLeod phenotype, an X-linked abnormality of expression of Kell blood group antigens, were identified in a single family and included 1 female. The genetics of neuroacanthocytosis are unclear and probably heterogeneous, but the available pedigree data and the association with the McLeod phenotype suggest that there may be a locus for this disorder on the short arm of the X chromosome.\r"

The mean age at onset of symptoms was 31 (range 11-58) yrs; 46 (92%) were women and 47 (94%) were obese (mean weight 90 kg). Common symptoms were headache (92%), transient visual obscurations (72%) and intracranial noises (60%); 13 of the patients (26%) initially had complaints of sustained visual loss. There was visual loss as determined by Goldmann perimetry in 96% and by automated perimetry in 92%. Contrast sensitivity testing was abnormal in 50% and Snellen acuity in 22%. Two patients (4%) became blind in both eyes. The Goldmann visual field grade improved in 60% of patients but visual function deteriorated in 5 (10%). Deterioration of visual field grade was significantly associated only with weight gain during the year before diagnosis. Visual loss in patients with IIH is common and is often reversible. Patients should be evaluated by perimetry using an appropriate strategy and contrast sensitivity testing, along with careful examination of the optic discs.\r"

Intrathecal production of IgM was detected in 55% of patients and was found to correlate with disease activity, manifesting as a recent relapse, as well as the total number of relapses. An inverse correlation was found between CSF oligoclonal IgM and both the time interval between the last relapse and lumbar puncture, and duration of the disease process. It also correlated with the number of leucocytes, free kappa and lambda light chain bands in CSF. No correlation was found between intrathecal IgM synthesis and degree of disability (Kurtzke scale), disease progression index (Poser scale), or total cerebral plaque burden (detected by enhanced CT and MRI scans). Oligoclonal IgM bands were found to be more specific for active disease process than either IgM index or total CSF IgM amount. It is concluded that intrathecal synthesis of IgM, as detected by CSF oligoclonal bands, is a useful parameter in monitoring disease relapse activity in MS.\r"

No electrophysiological evidence of a cortical or brainstem reticular origin for the myoclonus was found. In the first patient the axial jerks only occurred spontaneously. The latencies of recruitment of spinal segments during a jerk indicated that the discharge arose in the mid thoracic cord and then slowly spread at about 5 ms-1 up and down the cord to involve rostral and caudal segments. No structural lesion was identified in this patient. In the second patient spontaneous and reflex axial jerks developed following the excision of a cervical haemangioblastoma. In the stimulus-induced jerks the relative latencies of muscles innervated by rostral and caudal spinal segments suggested that the myoclonus originated between the upper cervical and midthoracic cord. In the final patient, EMG activity during spontaneous and stimulus-induced jerks commenced in the rectus abdominis, and was followed by later activity in muscles innervated by rostral spinal segments, suggesting that the myoclonus originated in the midthoracic cord. No structural lesion was identified in this patient. Electrophysiological evidence is used to argue a spinal origin for these axial jerks in all 3 cases. There are striking features common both to this form of human myoclonus and to long propriospinal pathways identified in animals. The new concept of propriospinal myoclonus is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, there has been a growing consensus among investigators that the presence or absence of external cues guiding behaviour and attention is an important factor in determining whether or not deficits are found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In an earlier study, the authors suggested that the pattern of impaired and intact performance could be explained in terms of differential resource demands of the tasks, combined with depleted levels of central processing resources in PD patients. Two experiments are reported, both employing dual-task paradigms. The first assessed, in normal subjects, the relative processing demands of a cued and an uncued version of the Stroop task. The results supported the proposal that the noncued task made greater demands on the subject's limited processing resources. Further, performing a resource demanding secondary task concurrently with the Stroop test produced, in normal subjects, the same pattern of impaired performance as that reported previously in PD patients. In the second experiment the same dual-task paradigm was employed with a group of PD patients and normal aged-matched controls. Only the patients showed an increase in reaction time on the Stroop task when performing a resource demanding secondary task. The patients also showed an interfering effect with concurrent foot tapping but not with an articulatory suppression task. The results were taken to support the hypothesis that PD patients have depleted central processing resources. In considering the present data, alternative explanations for the results are considered, in particular the possibility that they represent a deficit in switching processing resources between two tasks as the combined demands outweigh available resources.\r"

  ".U": "91152455\r", 
  ".W": "The electromyographic (EMG) response of the initially passive biceps brachii muscle to imposed extension applied at the elbow was studied in 19 hemiparetic and 12 normal subjects. In relaxed normal subjects, the biceps muscle was found to respond only at displacement velocities above 175 deg/s, with a single early burst of activity in the biceps EMG. In contrast, the hemiparetic subjects, in addition to the early EMG activity, also showed considerable late activity, which persisted even with stretch velocities as low as 35 deg/s. This late activity is a stretch reflex, present in fully plegic arms. It was seen in all spastic subjects in whom the tone of the biceps had been clinically assessed to be raised, but was never observed in subjects with normal muscle tone. The mean level of this EMG response was highly correlated with displacement velocity and its duration to the duration of the applied displacement. It is suggested that this reflex EMG activity is the major factor in the genesis of spastic hypertonus in the arm and that it arises not from a reduction in the threshold of the stretch reflexes of the muscle, but from a pathological increase in stretch reflex gain. It is further shown that this activity is at a high level between the first and third months after the onset of spasticity and that the reflex gain is significantly reduced when spasticity is established for a year or more. It is concluded that, while changes in passive mechanical properties may play a role when spasticity has been established for more than a year, the major cause of spastic muscle hypertonus is a pathological increase in stretch reflex activity.\r"

Deviations from these presuppositions, as in crossed aphasics and perhaps left handers, are generally considered to be 'exceptions' and either to disprove the rules or to be irrelevant to the rule. We report 4 very 'exceptional' cases, right handers with almost entirely reversed lateralization of functions. Analysis of the intrahemispheric relationships between functions suggests that there may be a specific neurobiology to the interrelationships between and among cognitive functions, handedness, and the intrahemisphere localization of the function.\r"

The general clinical profile, as well as characteristics of the patient's immediate memory for word lists, suggests the occurrence of a 'mirror image' crossed aphasia. Detailed analysis of the patient's ability to repeat and to comprehend sentences, however, indicates some important differences between this case and previously reported patients with short-term memory impairment. It is suggested that these differences, which may be related to an unusual pattern of neuroanatomical organization of cognitive functions, involve symptom dissociations with implications for models of normal language/memory interactions.\r"

  ".W": "The spectra of myelin sheath thickness and g ratio (axon diameter/fibre diameter) of guinea pig optic nerves for 8 animals with acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) were compared with those for 6 normal animals. The mean myelin sheath thickness of 0.12 microns for the animals with EAE was significantly lower than the value of 0.16 microns for the normal animals. Since fibre diameter comprises axon diameter plus the thickness of its surrounding myelin sheath, a reduction in mean fibre diameter from 1.52 microns in normals to 1.20 microns in EAE was expected, but it was surprising to find that a mean g ratio of 0.85 obtained for normal nerves was not substantially different from a value of 0.86 for demyelinated optic nerves. A decrease in the mean axon diameter of 1.24 microns for normal animals to 0.94 microns for those with EAE tended to offset the decrease in mean myelin sheath thickness and contributed to the relative stability of the g ratio with acute demyelination. Our results showing reduction in axonal calibre and myelin sheath thickness may offer an explanation for apparent discrepancies between electrophysiological delays in conduction characteristics of experimental and, if not the result of a maturational effect on myelination, human primary demyelinating disorders associated with the scant histopathological demyelination of initial attacks of EAE and the visually asymptomatic patients with multiple sclerosis.\r"

Blepharospasm induced by acute dopamine depletion in parkinsonism restricts saccade initiation possibly via the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). If essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia similarly restrict saccades, then a selective, somatotopically arranged pathway such as the SNpr may be involved. To test this possibility memory-contingent and visually-guided saccades were measured in patients with essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia. The latency of both forms of saccades was either significantly prolonged or excessively variable, while the accuracy and peak velocity of these fast eye movements were similar to age-matched control subjects. Essential blepharospasm and cranial dystonia alter the initiation of saccadic eye movements. Subcortical brain regions or pathways where eyelid, saccade and cranial/cervical motor control are somatotopically approximated, such as the SNpr, may be involved in blepharospasm.\r"

As was previously found for [3H]proline-labelled protein, axonally transported glycoprotein was increased before demyelination. Fluorographic analysis of the increased glycoproteins and proteins, after separation by gel electrophoresis, showed particularly large increases in labelling of 2 glycoproteins (38.1 kDa and 45.0 kDa) and 3 protein (15.9 kDa, 23.8 kDa and 27.7 kDa) bands. These increases were due to host-cell rather than viral components. At the time of demyelination, however, [3H]fucose incorporation into retinae of SFV-infected mice was significantly depressed, resulting in reduced label incorporation into axonally transported glycoproteins. Since glycoproteins play a role in axon-glia recognition and adhesion, the early changes in their axonal transport may contribute to the mechanism of demyelination.\r"

Recent studies indicate, however, that PD impairments may be different for well-learned, natural movements performed without visual guidance, or movements associated with sequential motor behaviours such as speech. To address this issue, PD subjects and age/sex-matched controls were compared on the performance of three tasks, all of which required lowering the jaw: (1) single, rapid, visually-guided movements; (2) equivalent movements associated with a single speech syllable (inherently without visual guidance), and (3) well-learned speech movements produced in a natural sequence. PD subjects manifested similar deficits for visually-guided jaw lowering as those previously reported for arm movements, namely reduced velocity/amplitude ratios and increased movement durations. By contrast, analogous jaw movements during the sequential speech tasks were unimpaired on these measures. These results suggest that PD motor impairments are influenced by a variety of factors, including the degree to which tasks are familiar and natural, and the availability of visual information.\r"

Alterations in CSF amine metabolite levels were related primarily to PHT intoxication, and low CSF folate and thiamine levels, but not to length of treatment or CNS atrophy. PHT intoxication increased CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA). Low folate levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and homovanillic acid, while low thiamine levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and 3-methyoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol. It remains to be seen to what extent these alterations in biogenic amine metabolism, mediated by low CNS vitamin levels, also lead to deficits in cerebral function.\r"

In a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients over a 10 yr period with this syndrome, clinical and neuropsychological features, pathogenesis and outcome were studied to provide information concerning management and prognosis. The most common clinical presentation was that of a stroke affecting mainly the upper limb with cortical signs such as dysphasia, neglect or dyspraxia. Evidence from EEG, angiographic and neuropsychological data supported a vascular/haemodynamic basis for the presence of the acute neuropsychological changes, while the chronic changes were more likely to be due to diaschisis. A study of risk factors and cerebral angiography enabled 4 pathophysiological subgroups to be identified: (1) cardiac emboli to the origin of the middle cerebral artery; (2) severe extra-cranial cranial carotid artery occlusive disease with presumed embolism to the same site and/or involvement of haemodynamic factors; (3) proximal middle cerebral artery abnormalities causing occlusion of multiple lateral striate arteries at their origins; (4) normal angiography where pathogenesis was uncertain. The risk factors of cardiac disease and smoking were significantly increased as compared with age and sex-matched controls with other forms of ischaemic stroke. Stroke or vascular death rate was 2.7% per yr during a mean follow-up period of 2.25 yrs. Predictors of an excellent recovery with return to normal lifestyle were younger age, only brachial or brachiofacial weakness with absence of cortical signs at presentation and minimal change on angiography. This stroke entity deserves particular recognition in the spectrum of subcortical infarctions because of its specific pathogenesis, distinct neuropsychological features and reasonable prognosis.\r"

Detection thresholds for n-butyl alcohol, measured separately in each nostril, did not differ across subject groups or across nostrils, thus excluding any primary sensory loss. The discrimination task involved monorhinal presentation of repairs of unfamiliar odorants, which the subjects judged as same or different in quality. The results showed a significant deficit in discrimination confined to the nostril ipsilateral to the lesion in patients with temporal lobe removals. Patients with frontal lobe excisions were also impaired and, for patients with right frontal lesions including the orbital cortex, the impairment was found in both nostrils. Patients with left parietal lesions did not demonstrate any significant deficits. Normal subjects showed consistently better performance in the right than in the left nostril. The results are interpreted as reflecting the importance of the orbitofrontal cortex in olfactory discrimination. Temporal lobe lesions may disrupt the input to the orbitofrontal cortex, thereby producing poorer performance. The nostril difference in the normal subjects, together with the birhinal impairment in patients with right orbitofrontal damage, suggest a relative advantage of the right orbital region in olfactory processing.\r"

Maximal voluntary isometric torque generated by the elbow flexors was measured before, and at 5 min intervals during an endurance sequence of 45 min of repetitive isometric contractions (6 s duration, 4 s rest interval) producing 30% of the initial maximal voluntary torque. Electrical stimuli were also delivered to the elbow flexors to measure the contractile force in the intervals between voluntary contractions. The degree of central motor activation during maximal voluntary contractions was assessed using a sensitive method of twitch interpolation. In addition, the perceived effort required to achieve the target submaximal contractions was recorded using a standardized self-report scale. A high degree of central activation was achieved in maximal contractions during the endurance sequence both in the patients (mean of maximal force 93.6%; SD 7.8%), and in the control subjects (mean 90.9%; SD 9.5%). The relative torque produced by either voluntary or electrically stimulated contractions was not significantly different between patients and control subjects throughout the test. There was no significant difference in the perceived exertion between the patients and control subjects. These findings support the concept that neither poor motivation, nor muscle contractile failure is important in the pathogenesis of 'fatigue' in patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome.\r"

In Experiment 1, PD patients and controls performed sequences of hand postures that varied in length, the number of different postures (repetitive vs heterogeneous), and the delay interval before movement. Before movement, the PD group planned repetitive movements like controls whereas for heterogeneous sequences RT increased less with sequence length for the PD group, implying less preprogramming. The interresponse time (IRT) data from repetitive sequences showed that the PD group had difficulty controlling movement such that IRTs were faster when sequences were longer, thus allowing more time to schedule the termination of the sequence during the course of movement. For heterogeneous sequences, the PD group made more errors and were slower than controls when changing hand postures, suggesting a deficit in switching between different responses. While RT decreased with a longer delay similarly for both groups, IRT1 continued to improve only for the PD group but similarly for both types of sequences, suggesting a deficit specific to programming the first response. In Experiment 2, subjects made decisions about the number of different hand postures contained within a sequence. PD patients' decision times improved more with a longer delay only for heterogeneous sequences, suggesting a problem in identifying the number of different hand postures. The results have implications for levels of motor dysfunction in PD which emphasize the influence of sequence length and complexity.\r"

To adequately prepare teachers for the curriculum a series of faculty development programs in pedagogy were offered: first, a 2-day introductory workshop to initiate teachers into educational principles and their application in the new program; second, a 1-year basic training program in medical pedagogy; third, a 1-day workshop on PBL; and fourth, a comprehensive 3-day training program in PBL tutoring. Over 60% of all full-time teachers attended the introductory program and 80% the tutor training program. The 1-year basic training program was completed by 33% of the faculty members. The implementation of these programs, coupled with a high participation rate, resulted in a more student-centred educational philosophy and a greater interest in medical education. This had a significant impact when the new curriculum was instituted. Lessons learned from the experience are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics of pregnant women exposed to cocaine. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Women attending the Motherisk Program, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, from September 1985 to March 1990. PATIENTS: All women who had admitted using cocaine before or during pregnancy. Of the two control groups the first comprised women who had admitted using cannabinoids but not cocaine before or during pregnancy and the second those who attended the clinic just before the cocaine case but who had not used illicit drugs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Age, marital status, ethnic background, number of pregnancies, children and elective or spontaneous abortions, socioeconomic status of woman and male partner, alcohol use, cigarette use, frequency of cocaine use and total amount taken. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1625 women 91 (5.6%) admitted to using cocaine: 86 during the current pregnancy, 3 before the current pregnancy, 1 before planning a pregnancy and 1 during a previous pregnancy. None of the cocaine users were considered to be addicts; only 20% had used the drug more than 10 times. A total of 74 women used cannabinoids only. The mean age of the cocaine users was 27.1 (standard deviation [SD] 5.3) years; this was significantly lower than that of the control subjects (30.5 [SD 5.2] years) (p less than 0.001). More of the cocaine users than of the women in either of the two control groups were single (60% v. 38% and 14%, p less than 0.001). The cannabinoid users had significantly higher parity and the nonusers a significantly lower incidence of elective abortions than the cocaine users. The cocaine users had a significantly lower socioeconomic status than the control subjects (p less than 0.001); similarly, the male partners of the cocaine users had a significantly lower socioeconomic status than the partners of the control subjects (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant cocaine users who seek drug counselling represent a unique risk group, with clustering of factors such as alcohol and cigarette use and low socioeconomic status that compound the risk to the fetus. New strategies should be explored to identify such women, especially addicts, in their communities and to urge them to seek counselling and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Obtaining a patient's consent is a routine daily process for physicians, although many are unaware of the scope of this legal obligation. In 1980 the Supreme Court of Canada changed the law relating to informed consent; promotion of patient autonomy shifted the focus from a standard of professional disclosure to one of a \"reasonable patient.\" Physicians have a legal obligation to disclose to patients specific information, the scope of which is determined by a court on the basis of a reasonable patient's expectation and the circumstances of the case. This gives rise to many controversies in the practice of clinical medicine. It is difficult for physicians to know which treatment risks require disclosure, since this is decided by a court in a retrospective analysis of the evidence. Will the court recognize exceptions to the duty of disclosing information? If several health care professionals are involved in a patient's care who has the duty to disclose information? Can this duty be delegated? This paper provides physicians with guidelines that are consistent with the promotion of patient autonomy and comply with the doctrine of informed consent. In addition, it suggests ways of improving awareness of the doctrine and procedures to ease its application.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical features and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). DATA SOURCE AND SELECTION: All articles on OSA published in French and English between 1970 and 1990 and indexed in Index Medicus were reviewed. Studies addressing the epidemiologic features and clinical aspects of OSA were selected, and special emphasis was given to articles reporting the effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality rates. MAIN RESULTS: OSA is characterized by episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep that result in repetitive hypoxemia and sleep disruption. OSA leads to various neuropsychologic and cardiovascular complications, including daytime hypersomnolence, cognitive impairment, systemic and pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. There is suggestive evidence that the death rate among affected people is increased. The true incidence of OSA is unknown, but estimates have varied from 1% upwards among men. The current treatment with the greatest overall effectiveness and acceptability is nasal continuous positive airway pressure. CONCLUSION: This common, readily treatable disorder is associated with serious complications and therefore must be widely recognized by health professionals.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; assessment upon entry to study and at 3, 6 and 12 months afterward. SETTING: Geriatrician referral-based secondary care. PATIENTS: A total of 113 consecutively referred elderly patients with deteriorating functional status believed to have rehabilitation potential; 55 were assessed and treated by an interdisciplinary team in a day hospital (treatment group), and 58 were assessed in an inpatient unit or an outpatient clinic or were discharged early with appropriate community services (control group). OUTCOME MEASURES: Barthel Index, Rand Questionnaire, Global Health Question and Geriatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (GQLQ). MAIN RESULTS: Eight study subjects and four control subjects died; the difference was insignificant. Functional status deteriorated over time in the two groups; although the difference was not significant there was less deterioration in the control group. The GQLQ scores indicated no significant difference between the two groups in the ability to perform daily living activities and in the alleviation of symptoms over time but did show a trend favouring the control group. The GQLQ scores did indicate a significant difference in favour of the control group in the effect of treatment on emotions (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: The care received at the day hospital did not improve functional status or quality of life of elderly patients as compared with the otherwise excellent geriatric outpatient care.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart audit. SETTING: Urban tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All term neonates who received phototherapy but were not admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: Educational program and clinical recall interview. MEASURES: Charts were reviewed from March to May 1986 (period I, before publication of the guidelines) and from November 1986 to January 1987 (period II, after publication and after the educational program). The audits were repeated from April to June 1989 (period III, during the interview phase) and from October to December 1989 (period IV, 6 months after the interviews). Two criteria determined the appropriate use of phototherapy: the serum bilirubin level and the postnatal day on which phototherapy was started. RESULTS: The proportion of infants receiving phototherapy for whom there were orders for complete blood counts to investigate hyperbilirubinemia increased from 20% in period I to 37% in period IV. The frequency of orders to determine the proportion of reticulocytes did not change significantly. The number of infants receiving phototherapy decreased over the study periods. The proportion receiving phototherapy in accordance with the criteria for the serum bilirubin level increased from 10% to 17% after the educational program (insignificant difference) and to 31% after the interviews (p = 0.02). Compliance with the guidelines was greater before the infants were 2 days old than when they were 3 days old or more (p = 0.01). Of the 45 physicians who prescribed phototherapy (for 94 infants) during period IV 26 never prescribed in accordance with the guidelines. The other 19 prescribed in accordance with the guidelines for 30 of 52 infants. Decisions to investigate and treat with phototherapy were affected by clinical and parental factors in addition to the guidelines. Two of the 25 physicians interviewed stated that the interview would influence their management of future cases of hyperbilirubinemia. CONCLUSION: A clinical recall interview can have a greater impact on changing physician management practices than factual communication on a group basis.\r"

SETTING: Inpatient wards of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. PATIENTS: All children under 18 years of age admitted to the hospital from Jan. 1, 1979, to Dec. 31, 1989, under ICD code E917, E922, E955, E965, E970 or E985 who had suffered air gun injuries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Personal data, circumstances of event and clinical data. RESULTS: The 43 children (37 boys) had a median age of 12 years. The circumstances of the accident were known in 20 cases: 17 children were playing and 3 were cleaning the gun when it went off. Four children thought the gun was unloaded. In five cases the bullet ricocheted into the eye. Nine injuries were self-inflicted. Injury was to the extremities in 21 (49%), the eyes in 15 (35%) and the head and neck in 7 (16%). The median length of hospital stay was 4 days. Six children had long-term disabilities, all the result of eye injuries; two had cataract surgery, and four required enucleation of the eye. CONCLUSIONS: Air guns can cause serious injury to children. Their sale needs to be banned or at least carefully regulated.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is frequently made by taking a meticulous history coupled with a high index of suspicion. Snoring and hypersomnolence are clinical features common to individuals with sleep apnea. Since snoring is said to be a \"disease of listeners,\" it is not uncommon that bed partners reported an increased incidence of depression and marital displeasure. It is for this reason that the spouse or bed partner should be interviewed, since the patient may not be aware of any sleeping problems. Physicians should also be alert to complaints of excessive daytime somnolence, because studies have shown that patients with obstructive sleep apnea are at increased risk for automobile crashes. It has been estimated that approx 58,000 motor vehicle accidents involving people with sleep apnea will occur in the US each yr. By proper diagnosis and treatment, the physician is in a unique position to prevent at least some of the automobile accidents that result from falling asleep while driving. Polysomnography is the only definitive way to obtain a diagnosis of sleep apnea. This allows the physician not only to diagnosis the disorder, but also helps in the evaluation of the severity of the syndrome and selection of therapy. An ENT evaluation is also important in ruling out anatomic disorders that can cause upper airway obstruction. Certain factors, such as alcohol and sedative ingestion, may aggravate the condition in a person predisposed to sleep apnea, and subtle changes, such as unexplained hypertension, polycythemia, and cor pulmonale, should lead one to investigate the possibility of sleep apnea as the etiology.\r"

Perhaps exercise tests are most valuable in cases where the patient's symptoms are mainly limited to exercise and where investigations done at rest have failed to resolve a diagnostic question. When exercise testing is used under these circumstances, it serves a unique function in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Iron may play a central role in oxygen radical generation during myocardial ischemia and after reperfusion. Because conditions during ischemia may also liberate iron, we hypothesized that administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine during ischemia would result in improved functional and metabolic recovery after postischemic reperfusion. METHODS AND RESULTS. Isolated, perfused rabbit hearts were studied by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The hearts received one of three treatments: deferoxamine at the onset of 30 minutes of global ischemia (n = 9), deferoxamine as a bolus followed by a continuous 15-minute infusion begun at reflow (n = 9), or standard perfusate (n = 7). Hearts treated with deferoxamine during ischemia showed better recovery of developed pressure than did control hearts (63.2 +/- 7.5% versus 41.2 +/- 2.9% of baseline) (p = 0.02) and better recovery of myocardial phosphocreatine content (92.4 +/- 10.3% versus 68.2 +/- 4.5% of baseline, p less than 0.05). These functional and metabolic benefits were comparable to those obtained with deferoxamine treatment during early reperfusion. In 15 additional hearts, intraischemic treatment with deferoxamine resulted in no reduction in oxygen radical concentrations as measured on frozen tissue by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at end ischemia, but the treatment eliminated the reperfusion-induced increase of free radical generation observed in control hearts (2.9 +/- 0.01 versus 7.0 +/- 0.07 microM, p less than 0.001). The magnitude of reduction was similar to that when deferoxamine was given at the onset of reflow (2.4 +/- 0.02 microM, p less than 0.001 versus control). CONCLUSIONS. These results demonstrate improved functional and metabolic recovery of myocardium treated with deferoxamine during ischemia, accompanied by a reduction in reperfusion-induced oxygen free-radical generation to the same degree as reflow treatment, confirming the importance of iron in the pathogenesis of myocardial reperfusion injury.\r"

  ".U": "91152855\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning on infarct size has been reported in canine hearts, which contain considerable amounts of xanthine oxidase, a free radical-producing enzyme. Furthermore, a recent study suggested that free radicals generated during preconditioning may contribute to the cardioprotective effect of preconditioning. The present study examined 1) whether preconditioning limits infarct size in rabbits, which, like humans, lack myocardial xanthine oxidase and 2) whether the cardioprotective effect of PC is mediated by free radicals. METHODS AND RESULTS. A branch of the circumflex coronary artery in rabbits was occluded for 30 minutes and then reperfused for 72 hours. Myocardial infarct size and area at risk were determined by histology and fluorescent particles, respectively. Five groups were studied: an untreated control group, a preconditioned group (PC group), a high-dose superoxide dismutase (SOD)-treated preconditioned group (high-dose SOD-PC group), a low-dose SOD-treated preconditioned group (low-dose SOD-PC group), and a SOD-plus-catalase-treated preconditioned group (SOD/CAT-PC group). Preconditioning was performed with four episodes of 5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reperfusion. The free radical scavengers (30,000 units/kg SOD for high-dose SOD-PC group, 15,000 units/kg SOD for low-dose SOD-PC group, and 30,000 units/kg SOD plus 55,000 units/kg catalase for SOD/CAT-PC group) were infused intravenously over 60 minutes starting 20 minutes before preconditioning. Infarct size as the percentage of area at risk was 45.1 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SEM) in the control group (n = 11), 13.3 +/- 3.0% in the PC group (n = 12), 9.7 +/- 1.8% in the high-dose SOD-PC group (n = 8), 11.9 +/- 2.2% in the low-dose SOD-PC group (n = 6), and 9.6 +/- 2.3% in the SOD/CAT-PC group (n = 6) (p less than 0.05 versus control for the last four values). The differences in infarct size as the percent of area at risk among the PC, high-dose SOD-PC, low-dose SOD-PC, and SOD/CAT-PC groups were not significant. CONCLUSION. Ischemic preconditioning delays ischemic myocardial necrosis regardless of myocardial xanthine oxidase content. Free radicals are unlikely to have a major role in the mechanism of the preconditioning in rabbits.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Recent advances in miniaturization of phased-array and mechanical ultrasound devices have resulted in exploration of alternative approaches to cardiac and vascular imaging in the form of transesophageal or intravascular imaging. Preliminary efforts in adapting phased-array endoscopes designed for transesophageal use to a transvascular approach have used full-sized phased-array devices introduced directly into the right atrium in open-chested animals. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a custom-made, very small phased-array endoscope for intracardiac imaging introduced intravascularly through a jugular venous approach in young piglets. METHODS AND RESULTS. Experimental atrial septal defects created in four piglets (3-4 weeks old) had been closed with a buttoned atrial septal defect closure device consisting of an occluder in the left atrium and a counteroccluder in the right atrium. Five to 15 days after atrial septal defect closure, the piglets were returned to the experimental laboratory, where a 6.3-mm, 17-element, 5-MHz phased-array probe mounted on a 4-mm endoscope was introduced through a cutdown incision of the external jugular vein and advanced to the right atrium. From the right atrium all four cardiac chambers, their inflows and outflows, and all four valves were well imaged with minimal superior and inferior rotation. High-resolution imaging of the atrial septum defined with anatomical accuracy, later verified by autopsy, the exact placement of both the occluder and counteroccluder in the left and right sides of the atrial septal defects and the absence of any shunting across the atrial septum in any of the four animals. CONCLUSIONS. Our efforts indicate that transvascular passage of small phased-array probes can be easily accomplished and is a promising technique for detailed visualization of cardiac structures. This approach may provide an alternative to transesophageal echocardiography, particularly for guiding interventional procedures such as placement of transcatheter closure devices in pediatric patients.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Previous studies have shown that global left ventricular function is depressed after myocardial infarction. However, little is known about the effects of myocardial infarction on contractility and the passive-elastic properties of residual myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated isometric function and passive myocardial stiffness in isolated, noninfarcted left ventricular papillary muscle from rats 6 weeks after sham operation or myocardial infarction. Maximal developed tension and peak rate of tension rise (+dT/dt) were significantly decreased in untreated rats with large myocardial infarction compared with controls (3.3 +/- 1.1 versus 4.3 +/- 0.6 g/mm2 and 49.5 +/- 17.5 versus 72.5 +/- 10.5 g/mm2/sec, respectively). Time to peak tension was prolonged (120 +/- 8 versus 102 +/- 4 msec) and myocardial stiffness was increased in untreated myocardial infarction rats compared with controls (35.2 +/- 4.9 versus 24.2 +/- 3.7). Rats with smaller myocardial infarctions differed from controls only with respect to a prolongation of time to peak tension. Papillary muscle myocyte cross-sectional area was increased by 44% (p less than 0.05), and myocardial hydroxyproline content was increased by 160% (p less than 0.05) in rats with large myocardial infarctions compared with controls. To determine whether treatment that improves left ventricular function after myocardial infarction also improves myocardial function, rats were treated with captopril beginning 3 weeks after myocardial infarction and continuing for 3 weeks. Treatment with captopril attenuated the prolongation in time to peak tension in the myocardial infarction rats; however, developed tension, +dT/dt, and muscle stiffness remained abnormal. Compared with untreated myocardial infarction rats, captopril-treated myocardial infarction rats had a 9% decrease in myocyte cross-sectional area (p = 0.1) but a persistent increase in myocardial collagen content. In summary, large myocardial infarction in rats causes contractile dysfunction, increased stiffness, myocyte hypertrophy, and increased collagen content in the residual noninfarcted myocardium. Treatment with captopril alters the process of cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy and improves one parameter of contractility in noninfarcted myocardium; however, myocardial collagen content and myocardial stiffness remain abnormal. CONCLUSIONS. These findings suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in the rat infarct model of heart failure improves global cardiac performance via combined effects on myocardial function and the peripheral circulation.\r"

Accordingly, we designed studies to determine if endothelium-dependent relaxation in hypercholesterolemic rabbits may be restored by supplying L-arginine, the precursor of EDRF. METHODS AND RESULTS. Normal or hypercholesterolemic rabbits received intravenous L-arginine (10 mg/kg/min) or vehicle for 70 minutes. Subsequently, animals were killed, thoracic aortas were harvested, and vascular rings were studied in vitro. Rings were contracted by norepinephrine and relaxed by acetylcholine chloride or sodium nitroprusside. Vasorelaxation was quantified by determining the maximal response (expressed as percent relaxation of the contraction) and the ED50 (dose of drug inducing 50% relaxation; expressed as -log M). In vessels from hypercholesterolemic animals receiving vehicle, there was a fivefold rightward shift in sensitivity to acetylcholine compared with normal animals (p = 0.05, n = 5 in each group). In vessels from hypercholesterolemic animals, L-arginine augmented the maximal response to acetylcholine (83 +/- 16% versus 60 +/- 15%, p = 0.04 versus vehicle) and increased the sensitivity to acetylcholine (ED50 value: 6.7 +/- 0.2 versus 6.2 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.05 versus vehicle). Arginine did not affect maximal and EC50 responses to acetylcholine in vessels from normal animals. Arginine did not potentiate endothelium-independent responses in either group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the endothelium-dependent relaxation is normalized in hypercholesterolemic rabbit thoracic aorta by in vivo exposure to L-arginine, the precursor for EDRF.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Abnormalities in coronary blood flow are responsible for stress-induced reductions in contractile function in pressure overload hypertrophy. Less is known about coronary blood flow in volume overload. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that coronary blood flow abnormalities were responsible for contractile abnormalities in experimental volume overload hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined coronary blood flow at rest and during pacing in seven dogs with contractile dysfunction secondary to chronic experimental mitral regurgitation (average regurgitant fraction at 3 months, 0.58 +/- 0.05). After 3 months of mitral regurgitation, left ventricular mass had increased from 92 +/- 8 g at baseline to 118 +/- 10 g (p less than 0.002). The slope of the end-ejection stress-volume relation, one of our indexes used to estimate contractile function, had fallen from 5.4 +/- 0.3 at baseline to 3.0 +/- 0.3 at 3 months of mitral regurgitation (p less than 0.001). In the mitral regurgitation dogs, coronary blood flow at rest was similar to that of control dogs (endocardial blood flow: control dogs, 1.33 +/- 0.12 ml/min/g; mitral regurgitation dogs, 1.16 ml/min/g, p = NS; epicardial blood flow at rest: control dogs, 1.30 +/- 0.16 ml/min/g; mitral regurgitation dogs 1.13 +/- 0.2 ml/min/g, p = NS). With pacing-induced stress, coronary blood flow increased appropriately in control and mitral regurgitation dogs. Ultrasonic dimension gauges placed in the endocardium and epicardium demonstrated no further deterioration in ventricular function during pacing in the mitral regurgitation dogs. In a separate group of five control dogs and five dogs with mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction, coronary blood flow was examined in the conscious closed-chest state at rest, during adenosine infusion, and during rapid atrial pacing (240 beats/min). Blood flow increased similarly in both groups during pacing and adenosine infusion. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that in dogs with mitral regurgitation that have developed contractile dysfunction, abnormalities in coronary blood flow do not explain the resting contractile dysfunction. Furthermore, studies during pacing-induced stress and coronary vasodilation with adenosine demonstrate that substantial coronary blood flow reserve is present in this type of volume overload hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental studies demonstrate that short-term regional perfusion-contraction matching, in which the energy demands of regional myocardial contraction are reduced to match the diminished myocardial substrate supply, occurs during states of low coronary blood flow under resting conditions and during exercise-induced ischemia. This phenomenon is rapidly reversible and appears to occur in several clinical settings. Sustained perfusion-contraction matching is observed in states of partial experimental ischemia of intermediate duration lasting several hours. This condition might be called short-term hibernation and resembles clinical conditions such as unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction with some residual perfusion in which the contractile defect can be improved by reperfusion provided the ischemia is not severe enough to cause transmural necrosis. Such experimental and clinical observations may or may not relate to the setting of regional dysfunction at rest in patients with chronic coronary heart disease, in whom manifestations of acute ischemia may be absent but improvement of wall motion abnormalities occurs after CABG or balloon angioplasty. This condition may constitute the hypothetical state of chronic myocardial hibernation, for which tentative evidence exists from metabolic and perfusion studies using PET. Whether such a condition of prolonged perfusion-contraction matching might be associated with adaptive processes that could allow its persistence for long periods without manifest ischemia remains to be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The 10-year incidence of myocardial infarction (fatal and nonfatal) and the prognosis after infarction were evaluated in 686 patients with stable angina who were randomly assigned to medical or surgical treatment in the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS. Myocardial infarction was defined by either new Q wave findings or clinical symptoms compatible with myocardial infarction accompanied by serum enzyme elevations with or without electrocardiographic findings. Treatment comparisons were made according to original treatment assignment; 35% of the medical cohort had bypass surgery during the 10-year follow-up period. The overall cumulative infarction rate was somewhat higher in patients assigned to surgery (36%) than in medical patients (31%) (p = 0.13) due to perioperative infarctions (13%) and an accelerated infarction rate after the fifth year of follow-up (average, 2.4%/yr in the surgical group versus 1.4%/yr in the medical group). The 10-year cumulative incidence of death or myocardial infarction was also higher in surgical (54%) than in medical (49%) patients (p = 0.20). According to the Cox model, the estimated risk of death after infarction was 59% lower in surgical than in medical patients (p less than 0.0001). The reduction in postinfarction mortality with surgery was most striking in the first month after the event: 99% in the first month (p less than 0.0001) and 49% subsequently (p less than 0.0001). The estimated risk of death in the absence of infarction was nearly identical regardless of treatment (p = 0.75). Exclusion of perioperative infarctions did not alter the findings. CONCLUSIONS. Although surgery does not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction overall, it does reduce the risk of mortality after infarction, particularly in the first 30 days after the event (fatal infarctions).\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare, in a single cohort of patients, the values of inducible VT, delayed ventricular activation, low left ventricular ejection fraction, high-grade ventricular ectopy, and ST segment displacement on exercise in predicting electrical events (witnessed instantaneous death and spontaneous VT or VF) during the first year after myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Three hundred sixty one patients aged less than 71 years underwent electrophysiological study, signal-averaged electrocardiogram, gated blood-pool scan, 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and exercise testing 1-2 weeks after myocardial infarction and were then followed up for at least 1 year. There were 34 deaths (eight witnessed instantaneous, 26 other), and nine patients survived one or more episodes of spontaneous VF or VT. Patients with inducible VT were 15.2 times more likely to suffer electrical events than patients without inducible VT. No proportional-hazards model excluding inducible VT was as good a predictor of electrical events as was inducible VT alone. CONCLUSIONS. Inducible VT at electrophysiological study was the single best predictor of spontaneous VT and sudden death after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. This study compared the sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of a \"conventional\" and \"accelerated\" programmed stimulation protocol in 293 patients with coronary artery disease who had a history of sustained or nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). METHODS AND RESULTS. In the conventional protocol, one and two extrastimuli were introduced during sinus rhythm and during basic drive trains at cycle lengths of 600 and 400 msec at the right ventricular apex and then at the outflow tract or septum. In the accelerated protocol, one, two, and then three extrastimuli were introduced at each of three basic drive train cycle lengths (350, 400, and 600 msec) at the right ventricular apex; the procedure was repeated at a second right ventricular site. Six hundred thirty-four electrophysiological tests were performed using one of these two protocols either in the baseline state (293 tests) or during drug testing (341 tests). The yield of sustained, monomorphic VT was 89% with the conventional protocol and 92% with the accelerated protocol during baseline tests in patients who had a history of sustained VT (p = 0.05); 20% and 34%, respectively, during baseline tests in patients with a history of nonsustained VT (p = 0.06); and 70% and 77%, respectively, during drug testing (p = 0.2). To induce sustained, monomorphic VT, 10.1 +/- 5.0 (mean +/- SD) protocol steps and 14.4 +/- 8.7 minutes were required with the conventional protocol, compared with 4.0 +/- 3.7 steps and 5.6 +/- 6.1 minutes with the accelerated protocol (p less than 0.001 for each comparison). Among the tests in which sustained, monomorphic VT was induced, sustained polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation was induced more often with the conventional protocol (3.6%) than with the accelerated protocol (0.9%, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. The efficiency of programmed stimulation can be improved by the early use of a basic drive train cycle length of 350 msec and three extrastimuli. Compared with a conventional stimulation protocol, the accelerated protocol used in this study reduces the number of protocol steps and duration of time required to induce monomorphic VT by an average of more than 50% and improves the specificity of programmed stimulation without impairing the yield of monomorphic VT.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. There is increasing evidence that neuropeptide Y (NPY) contributes to the autonomic control of the circulation. NPY coexists with noradrenaline in perivascular nerve terminals, may be released during sympathetic stimulation, and is a potent constrictor of the human coronary circulation and other vascular beds. In vitro studies show that NPY can act either directly on vascular smooth muscle or indirectly by modulation of the presynaptic release or the postsynaptic actions of noradrenaline. It is unclear to what extent these mechanisms operate in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS. The effect on forearm blood flow of intra-arterial NPY was studied in six volunteers during coinfusion of noradrenaline and during reflex sympathetic stimulation induced by lower-body negative pressure. NPY alone induced a dose-dependent reduction of forearm blood flow in all subjects studied, to a maximum of 49 +/- 6.1%. The reduction of flow during infusion of noradrenaline alone was 42 +/- 8%. The response to noradrenaline was unaffected by coinfusion of a threshold constrictor dose of NPY (50 pmol/min). Furthermore, the reflex sympathetic vasoconstrictor response to 20 cm H2O of lower-body negative pressure was similar in both the infused and control arms during the infusion of 50 pmol/min NPY. The response to noradrenaline was abolished by alpha-blockade with phentolamine, but the flow reduction induced by NPY was unaffected by alpha-blockade. CONCLUSIONS. NPY is a potent constrictor of human forearm resistance vessels and has a direct effect independent of alpha-receptors. NPY has no detectable modulating effect in vivo on the action of endogenous or infused noradrenaline.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Optimal timing of cardiac transplantation in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction is often difficult. To determine whether measurement of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) during maximal exercise testing can be used to identify patients in whom transplantation can be safely deferred, we prospectively performed exercise testing on all ambulatory patients referred for transplant between October 1986 and December 1989. METHODS AND RESULTS. Patients were assigned into one of three groups on the basis of exercise data: Group 1 (n = 35) comprised patients accepted for transplant (VO2 less than or equal to 14 ml/kg/min); group 2 (n = 52) comprised patients considered too well for transplant (VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min); and group 3 (n = 27) comprised patients with low VO2 rejected for transplant due to noncardiac problems. All three groups were comparable in New York Heart Association functional class, ejection fraction, and cardiac index (p = NS). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was significantly lower in group 2 than in either group 1 or 3 (p less than 0.05), although there was wide overlap. Patients with preserved exercise capacity (group 2) had cumulative 1- and 2-year survival rates of 94% and 84%, which are equal to survival levels after transplantation. In contrast, patients rejected for transplant (group 3) had survival rates of only 47% at 1 year and 32% at 2 years, whereas patients awaiting transplantation (group 1) had a survival rate of 70% at 1 year (both p less than 0.005 versus patients with VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min). All deaths in group 2 were sudden. By univariate and multivariate analyses, peak VO2 was the best predictor of survival, with only pulmonary capillary wedge pressure providing additional prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that cardiac transplantation can be safely deferred in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and peak exercise VO2 of more than 14 ml/min/kg.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Few data are available on the long-term outcome of patients who undergo laser-assisted balloon angioplasty for recanalization of occluded peripheral arteries. Because the cost of laser angioplasty is high, the value of the method should be carefully analyzed before it can be considered a routine method for recanalization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early and late results of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty in patients who could not be recanalized by conventional techniques. METHODS AND RESULTS. Laser angioplasty was performed in 66 patients with total occlusion of the iliofemoral artery in whom mechanical techniques failed to recanalize the obstructed vessel. The system consisted of a pulsed dye laser operated at 480 nm, 2 microseconds/pulse, 5 Hz, 50 mJ/pulse coupled into a 0.021-in. laser catheter. The treatment laser was connected with a diagnostic laser to induce tissue fluorescence for spectroscopic analysis via the same fiber. The treatment laser was emitted only when atheromatous tissue was recognized. After a pilot hole was created by laser emission, dilatation was performed to enlarge the channel. The mean length of occlusion was 8.8 +/- 6.1 cm. The primary success rate was 82%. It did not depend on the length of occlusion but was greater in non-calcified than in calcified lesions (88% versus 71%, p less than 0.03). Complications included seven early reocclusions that could be recanalized and eight perforations without clinical sequelae. At a mean 18-month follow-up, 64% of the laser-treated arteries remained patent. The rate of patency was related neither to the length of the occlusion nor to calcifications but was lower in patients who had early reocclusion (p less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS. Pulsed dye laser-assisted balloon angioplasty is effective for recanalization of totally occluded arteries that cannot be treated by conventional means. The efficacy is limited by calcifications. The long-term patency rate is acceptable given the severity of the lesions.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In chronic mitral regurgitation, the myocardium responds to the increased filling volume by geometric alteration and eccentric hypertrophy. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a pure volume overload on left ventricular diastolic chamber and myocardial properties and to assess the relation of passive diastolic function to systolic ejection performance. METHODS AND RESULTS. By use of simultaneous cineangiography and left ventricular micromanometry, left ventricular passive diastolic stiffness was evaluated in nine normal controls (group 1), 14 patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and a normal ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 57%, group 2), and 13 patients with mitral regurgitation and a reduced ejection fraction (less than 57%, group 3). Passive diastolic function was evaluated by using a three-constant elastic model. Left ventricular chamber properties were represented by the relation of pressure to volume; myocardial properties were evaluated by relating myocardial midwall stress to midwall strain. The constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness was decreased in group 2 compared with controls (p less than 0.05) but it was normal in group 3. The constant of myocardial stiffness was increased in group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.01). Among patients with mitral regurgitation, there was a significant inverse relation between ejection fraction and the constant of myocardial stiffness (r = -0.83). CONCLUSIONS. The chronic adaptation to volume overload in chronic mitral regurgitation tends to decrease left ventricular chamber stiffness. Patients with mitral regurgitation and a depressed ejection fraction demonstrated diastolic myocardial dysfunction. Compromised diastolic function in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and reduced systolic performance may contribute to the clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure.\r"

The various filling patterns were shown to be related to the degree of cardiac amyloid infiltration. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of Doppler diastolic filling variables for assessing prognosis in cardiac amyloidosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. We performed pulsed-wave Doppler studies of the left ventricular inflow and obtained clinical follow-up data in 63 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis. All patients had typical echocardiographic features of cardiac involvement. The patients were subdivided into two groups according to deceleration time: Group 1 (33 patients) had a deceleration time of 150 msec or less, indicative of restrictive physiology, and group 2 (30 patients) had a deceleration time of more than 150 msec. Of the 63 patients, 32 (51%) died during a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 12 months. Of these deaths, 25 (78%) were cardiac deaths, and 19 of the 25 patients (76%) were from group 1. The 1-year probability of survival in group 1 was significantly less than that in group 2 (49% versus 92%, p less than 0.001). Bivariate analysis revealed that the combination of the Doppler variables of shortened deceleration time and increased early diastolic filling velocity to atrial filling velocity ratio were stronger predictors of cardiac death than were the two-dimensional echocardiographic variables of mean left ventricular wall thickness and fractional shortening. CONCLUSIONS. Doppler-derived left ventricular diastolic filling variables are important predictors of survival in cardiac amyloidosis.\r"

Within the same time period, 160,431 precordial echocardiographic examinations were performed in the 15 institutions; the ratio between TEE and transthoracic studies averaged 9.03 +/- 6.4% (range of the 15 centers, 1.4-23.6%). Of the 10,419 patients, 9,240 (88.7%) were conscious inpatients or outpatients at the time of the TEE examination; the vast majority of the conscious patients did not receive intravenous sedation before TEE. In 201 cases (1.9%), insertion of the TEE probe was unsuccessfully attempted because of a lack of patient cooperation and/or operator experience (98.5%) or because of anatomical reasons (1.5%). In 90 of 10,218 TEE studies (0.88%) with successful probe insertion, the examination had to be interrupted because of the patient's intolerance of the echoscope (65 cases); because of pulmonary (eight cases), cardiac (eight cases), or bleeding complications (two cases); or for other reasons (seven cases). One of the bleeding complications resulted from a malignant lung tumor with esophageal infiltration and was fatal (mortality rate, 0.0098%). CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter survey documents that TEE studies are associated with an acceptable low risk when used by experienced operators under proper safety conditions.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Right heart hemodynamics were analyzed with a catheter-mounted velocity meter in seven patients after direct atrioventricular anastomosis for Fontan procedure (RV group) and were compared with those obtained in eight patients after direct atriopulmonary anastomosis (RA group). METHODS AND RESULTS. In the RV group, cardiac output was 2.7 +/- 0.6 l/min/m2; mean right atrial and pulmonary artery pressures were both 13 +/- 3 mm Hg; mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure was 7 +/- 5 mm Hg; left ventricular end-diastolic volume, determined angiographically, was 129 +/- 40% of normal; and its ejection fraction was 0.50 +/- 0.09. In the RA group, data were similar to those of the RV group except that right heart pressure were lower in the RV group, which was related to the preoperative condition of the pulmonary circulation. In the RV group, the fraction of ventricular forward flow of the total forward flow in the main pulmonary artery ranged from 0.21 to 0.46 and was not correlated with cardiac output or with any other parameter. The backward flow into the inferior vena cava at ventricular systole was greater than the atrial flow in two patients in whom cardiac output was less than 2.2 l/min/m2, whereas caval backward flow at atrial contraction was greater than ventricular flow in the other five patients, of whom four had a cardiac output greater than 3.1 l/min/m2. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the inclusion of right ventricle in the circulation of the Fontan procedure does not necessarily improve overall hemodynamics in most patients.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The utility of transcatheter application of radiofrequency energy to eliminate atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty-nine patients (mean age, 53 +/- 20 years; range 14-86 years) with medically refractory AVNRT underwent perinodal ablation with radiofrequency energy. A custom-designed 6F catheter with a large (3-mm-long) distal electrode and interelectrode pacing of 2 mm was used in the majority of cases. The catheter used for ablation was initially positioned across the tricuspid anulus to obtain the largest His bundle electrogram, then withdrawn to obtain the largest atrial:ventricular electrogram ratio, with a small His bundle electrogram (less than or equal to 100 microV). Each application of radiofrequency energy (350-550 kHz, 16.2 +/- 5.2 W) was stopped after 60 seconds or if PR prolongation or an impedance rise was noted. The endpoints of the procedure were persistent modification of atrioventricular nodal conduction (either first-degree atrioventricular block or impairment of ventriculoatrial conduction) and noninducibility of AVNRT before and during isoproterenol administration. Radiofrequency energy was applied a mean of 6.8 +/- 3.5 times per session. After a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 3.0 months, 32 of the 39 patients (82%) have been free of AVNRT, and did not have high grade AV block. Three patients (8%) developed complete atrioventricular block and had pacemakers implanted. Two patients had unsuccessful initial procedures, and two patients had initially successful ablations but had recurrences of tachycardia 4-6 weeks later. Elimination of AVNRT appeared to be due to effects on the retrograde fast pathway in most patients. CONCLUSIONS. Radiofrequency ablation of the perinodal right atrium appears to be safe and effective for treatment of typical AVNRT.\r"

The relations of fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count to the incidence of IHD in the Caerphilly and Speedwell prospective studies are described. METHODS AND RESULTS. The two studies have a common core protocol and are based on a combined cohort of 4,860 middle-aged men from the general population. The first follow-up was at a nearly constant interval of 5.1 years in Caerphilly and 3.2 years in Speedwell; 251 major IHD events had occurred. Age-adjusted relative odds of IHD for men in the top 20% of the distribution compared with the bottom 20% were 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-6.5) for fibrinogen, 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-7.4) for viscosity, and 3.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-4.9) for white blood cell count. Associations with IHD were similar in men who had never smoked, exsmokers, and current smokers, and the results suggest that at least part of the effect of smoking on IHD is mediated through fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count. Multivariate analysis shows that white blood cell count is an independent risk factor for IHD as is either fibrinogen or viscosity, or possibly both. Jointly, these three variables significantly improve the fit of a logistic regression model containing all the main conventional risk factors. Further, a model including age, smoking habits, fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count predicts IHD as well as one in which the three hemostatic/rheological variables are replaced by total cholesterol, diastolic pressure, and body mass index. CONCLUSION. Jointly, fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count are important risk factors for IHD.\r"

  ".U": "91152892\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. At any given perfusion pressure, coronary reserve is expressed by the difference between autoregulated and maximally vasodilated flow. In hypertension the raised coronary resistance reduces the steepness of the pressure-flow relationship at maximal vasodilatation. In the presence of cardiac hypertrophy the line of autoregulated flow becomes higher. For these reasons coronary reserve is reduced and the point at which baseline flow approaches the maximal achievable flow might be shifted to a higher perfusion pressure. Thus, any reduction below this elevated and critical value of pressure would lower the coronary flow. METHODS AND RESULTS. The investigated patients were normotensive (controls, nine) and hypertensive with normal (group I, seven) or augmented LV mass index because of concentric LV hypertrophy (group II, eight). All had effort-induced angina and angiographically normal left epicardial branches. Flow in the great cardiac vein was measured by thermodilution in the baseline and during stepwise (5 mm Hg every 5 minutes) decrease of the coronary perfusion pressure with a titrated nitroprusside i.v. infusion; perfusion pressures of 60 mm Hg in the controls and 70 mm Hg in the hypertensives were taken as end points. Baseline flow averaged 102 ml/min in normotensives, 104 ml/min in hypertensive group I and 148 ml/min in hypertensive group II. At the end points flow was similar to baseline in the controls and group I. In group II coronary flow started to decline and myocardial O2 extraction started to slightly but significantly rise at perfusion pressures of 90-80 mm Hg; at the end point flow was reduced by 26% (p less than 0.01 from baseline). The perfusion patterns did not seem to be related to the changes in tension-time index and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS. The association of high blood pressure (reduced ability of the coronary arterioles to dilate) and hypertrophy of the myocardium (augmented baseline coronary flow) may shift the point of exhaustion of coronary reserve to a higher perfusion pressure and make the myocardium vulnerable to treatment-induced relative hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "91152893\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), immediate information about the result of the intervention is important, whereas morphological parameters are often less reliable than in diagnostic coronary arteriography. Recently, a new videodensitometric method was introduced and validated in animal experiments, which allows accurate comparison of maximal myocardial perfusion between situations with different degrees of stenosis. This method uses mean transit time (Tmn) of the contrast agent at maximal hyperemia as a parameter for maximal flow and is strictly in accordance with indicated dilation theory. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 40 patients with angina pectoris, single-vessel disease, and a positive exercise test at the time of acceptance for PTCA, this approach was applied for evaluation of the improvement of maximal flow achieved by the PTCA. Maximal vasodilation was induced immediately before and 15 minutes after PTCA by intracoronary administration of papaverine, and digital angiographic studies were performed. By special breath-holding instruction, almost motionless, triggered image acquisition was possible during 15-20 heartbeats. Excellent subtraction images could be obtained, and reliable determination of Tmn at maximal hyperemia was possible in 33 patients both before and after PTCA. The ratio between maximal flow after and before PTCA, called maximal flow ratio (MFR), was represented by the ratio between Tmn before and after the intervention and compared with the results of exercise testing 24-48 hours before and 7-10 days after the procedure. After correction for pressure changes, MFR was 2.2 +/- 1.5 for the 33 dilated vessels and 1.0 +/- 0.2 for 25 normal vessels serving as a control. In 94% of all patients, an MFR value of more than 1.6 or less than 1.6 discriminated between presence or absence of reversal of exercise test result from positive to negative. If on-line judgment of success was based upon angiographic parameters or measurement of trans-stenotic pressure gradient, the relation with noninvasive functional improvement was present only in 66% and 74% of all patients, respectively. A definite range of what can be called normal Tmn at maximal hyperemia could be distinguished, and post-PTCA values for successfully dilated arteries returned completely to this normal range. CONCLUSIONS. Accurate comparison of maximal myocardial perfusion before and after PTCA is possible in man, improvement of maximal flow is highly related to functional improvement as indicated by exercise test results, and, therefore, this method provides a straightforward way for on-line evaluation of the result of the intervention.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Simple heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression during exercise (delta ST/HR index) and the pattern of ST depression as a function of heart rate during exercise and recovery (the rate-recovery loop) have been shown to improve the ability of the exercise electrocardiogram to detect the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD), but the performance of these methods for the prediction of future coronary events remains to be examined. METHODS AND RESULTS. We compared the delta ST/HR index and the rate-recovery loop with standard electrocardiographic criteria for prediction of CHD events in 3,168 asymptomatic men and women in the Framingham Offspring Study who underwent treadmill exercise electrocardiography and who, at entry, were free of clinical and electrocardiographic evidence of CHD. After a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, there were 65 new CHD events: four sudden deaths, 24 new myocardial infarctions, and 37 incident cases of angina pectoris. When a Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for age and sex was used, a positive exercise electrocardiogram by standard criteria (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression) was not predictive of new CHD events (chi 2 = 0.40, p = 0.52). In contrast, stratification according to the presence or absence of a positive delta ST/HR index (greater than or equal to 1.6 microV/beat/min) and a positive (counterclockwise) rate-recovery loop was associated with CHD event risk (chi 2 = 9.45, p less than 0.01) and separated subjects into three groups with varying risks of coronary events: high risk, when both tests were positive (relative risk 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-5.4); intermediate risk, when either the delta ST/HR index or the rate-recovery loop was positive (relative risk, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.8); and low risk, when both tests were negative. After multivariate adjustment for age, sex, smoking, total cholesterol level, fasting glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, and electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, the combined delta ST/HR index and rate-recovery loop criteria remained predictive of coronary events (chi 2 = 5.45, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS. Heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression by the delta ST/HR index and the rate-recovery loop during exercise electrocardiography can improve prediction of future coronary events in asymptomatic men and women.\r"

A reliable, noninvasive procedure to determine the location of accessory atrioventricular connections in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome would add an important diagnostic tool to the clinical armamentarium. METHODS AND RESULTS. Body surface potential mapping (BSPM) using 180 electrodes in various-sized vests and displayed as a calibrated color map was used to determine the ventricular insertion site of the accessory atrioventricular (AV) connections in 34 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Attempts were made to determine the 17 ventricular insertion sites described by Guiraudon et al. All 34 patients had an electrophysiologic study (EPS) at cardiac catheterization, and 18 had surgery so the ventricular insertion sites could be accurately located using EPS at surgery. A number of physiologic observations were also made with BSPM. CONCLUSIONS. The following conclusions were drawn: 1) BSPM using QRS analysis accurately predicts the ventricular insertion site of accessory AV connections in the presence of a delta wave in the electrocardiogram; 2) the ventricular insertion sites of accessory AV connections determined by BSPM and by EPS at surgery were identical or within one mapping site (1.5 cm or less) in all but four of 18 cases; three of the four exceptions had more than one accessory AV connection, and the other had a very broad ventricular insertion; 3) BSPM and EPS locations of the accessory AV connections correlated very well in the 34 cases despite the fact that BSPM determines the ventricular insertion site and EPS determines the atrial insertion site of the accessory AV connection; 4) as suggested by the three cases of multiple accessory AV connections, EPS and BSPM may be complementary since BSPM identified one pathway and EPS identified the other (in the case with a broad ventricular insertion, BSPM and EPS demonstrated different proportions of that insertion); 5) BSPM using ST-T analysis is very much less accurate in predicting the ventricular insertion site of accessory AV connections unless there is marked preexcitation; 6) standard electrocardiography using the Gallagher grid methodology (but with no attempt at stimulating maximal preexcitation) was not as accurate as QRS analysis of BSPM in predicting the ventricular insertion site of the accessory AV connection; however, exact comparison is hampered by the different number and size of the Gallagher and Guiraudon insertion sites; 7) BSPM using QRS analysis appears to be very accurate in predicting right ventricular versus left ventricular posteroseptal accessory AV connections; 8) typical epicardial right ventricular breakthrough, indicative of conduction via the specialized AV conduction system, occurs in all patients with left ventricular free wall accessory AV connections; 9) epicardial right ventricular breakthrough was not observed in cases with right ventricular free wall or anteroseptal accessory AV connections; 10) epicardial right ventricular breakthrough can occur in the presence of posteroseptal accessory AV connections, whether right or left ventricular; and 11) the delay in epicardial right ventricular breakthrough in cases with left ventricular insertion may provide a marker to estimate the degree of ventricular preexcitation.\r"

METHODS AND RESULTS. The study comprised 388 patients admitted with chest pain and suspected myocardial infarction and 101 patients with skeletal muscle damage and additional suspected myocardial cell damage. Troponin T was elevated to more than twice the analytical sensitivity of the assay (0.5 microgram/l) in all patients with non-Q wave (range, 1.2-5 micrograms/l) and Q wave infarction (range, 3-220 micrograms/l). Troponin T appeared in serum as early as 3 hours after onset of pain in 50% of the patients and remained elevated in all patients for more than 130 hours, revealing release kinetics of both free cytosolic and structurally bound molecules. The diagnostic efficiency of troponin T was superior to that of creatine kinase-MB (98% versus 97%) and remained at 98% until 5.5 days after admission, if patients with unstable angina were excluded from analysis. In the 79 patients with unstable angina, troponin T was elevated (range, 0.55-3.1 micrograms/l) in at least one blood sample from each of 37 patients (56%). Circulating troponin T was correlated to the presence of reversible ST segment or T wave changes on the electrocardiogram (p less than 0.005) and to the frequency of in-hospital complications. In the 101 patients with skeletal muscle damage and suspected additional cardiac muscle damage, troponin T was the most useful test; its efficiency was 89% or 94% (depending on the discriminator value used) as compared with 63% for creatine kinase-MB. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, the data of the study indicate that the newly developed troponin T test improves the efficiency of serodiagnostic tools for the detection of myocardial cell necrosis as compared with conventionally used cardiac enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 27 patients after coronary balloon angioplasty to quantify the lumen and atheroma cross-sectional areas. METHODS AND RESULTS. A 20-MHz ultrasound catheter was inserted through a 1.6-mm plastic introducer sheath across the dilated area to obtain real-time images at 30 times/sec. The ultrasound images distinguished the lumen from atheroma, calcification, and the muscular media. The presence of dissection between the media and the atheroma was well visualized. These observations of tissue characterization were compared with an in vitro study of 20 human atherosclerotic artery segments that correlated the ultrasound images to histological preparations. The results indicate that high-quality intravascular ultrasound images under controlled in vitro conditions can provide accurate microanatomic information about the histological characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques. Similar quality cross-sectional ultrasound images were also obtained in human coronary arteries in vivo. Quantitative analysis of the ultrasound images from the clinical studies revealed that the mean cross-sectional lumen area after balloon angioplasty was 5.0 +/- 2.0 mm2. The mean residual atheroma area at the level of the prior dilatation was 8.7 +/- 3.4 mm2, which corresponded to 63% of the available arterial cross-sectional area. At the segments of the coronary artery that appeared angiographically normal, the ultrasound images demonstrated the presence of atheroma involving 4.7 +/- 3.2 mm2, which was a mean of 35 +/- 23% of the available area bounded by the media. CONCLUSIONS. Intravascular ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than angiography for demonstrating the presence and extent of atherosclerosis and arterial calcification. Intracoronary imaging after balloon angioplasty reveals that a significant amount of atheroma is still present, which may partly explain why the incidence of restenosis is high after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Acute coronary artery occlusion after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) continues to remain a serious complication despite significant improvement in operator performance and technological advancements. This retrospective study was performed to ascertain the frequency, predictive variables, management, and outcome of acute coronary artery occlusion. METHODS AND RESULTS. The study was based on data from 1,423 consecutive patients who underwent an elective coronary angioplasty between January 1986 and December 1988. Acute coronary artery occlusion occurred in 104 patients (7.3%). Acute occlusion developed during the dilatation procedure in 80 patients (5.6%) and within 24 hours after the procedure in 24 patients (1.7%). Four clinical and 14 angiographic variables predictive for acute coronary artery occlusion were analyzed in these 104 patients with a complicated procedure and were compared with those in 104 representative patients with successful attempts. Multivariate analysis found three independent predictive variables: unstable angina, multivessel disease, and complex lesions. The overall clinical outcome after management of acute coronary artery occlusion including immediate repeat dilatation (95 patients), use of intracoronary streptokinase (34 patients), or autoperfusion catheter (12 patients) was successful (reduction of lumen diameter to less than 50%, no death, no myocardial infarction [MI], and no emergency surgery) in 42 patients (40%), was a failure without major complication in four patients (4%), and was a failure with major complication (death, MI, and emergency surgery) in 58 patients (56%). The overall mortality rate was 6% (six patients), the overall MI rate was 36% (37 patients), and emergency bypass surgery was required in 30% of patients (31 patients). At 6 months' follow-up of 42 patients with successful management, recurrent angina pectoris due to restenosis occurred in 10 patients (24%), and a late MI occurred in one patient (3%). At 6 months' follow-up of 56 survivors with unsuccessful management (development of MI or need for emergency bypass surgery), recurrent angina occurred in nine patients (16%), and cardiac death in two patients (4%). However, the majority of patients in both groups were either symptom free or had mild angina pectoris. CONCLUSION. Acute coronary artery occlusion during PTCA is often unpredictable, but its frequency is higher in patients with unstable angina, multivessel disease, and complex lesions. Despite immediate redilatation, use of intracoronary streptokinase, and emergency bypass surgery, PTCA is associated with a high mortality and morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Several studies have identified transient disturbances of autonomic function during the acute and recovery phases of myocardial infarction, and it has recently been suggested that survivors of acute myocardial infarction with depressed vagal tone may be at increased risk of sudden or arrhythmic death. METHODS AND RESULTS. To investigate this hypothesis, parasympathetic function was assessed by arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) testing (using the phenylephrine method) and by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis from 24-hour Holter recording in 68 patients at day 7-10 after infarction. The relation between autonomic tone and markers of arrhythmic propensity, including programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) and late potentials in addition to other clinical variables, was examined. BRS for the whole group was 7.0 +/- 4.7 msec/mm Hg and was inversely correlated with age (r = 0.53, p less than 0.001) but not with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.035, p = NS). In those patients in whom sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) was induced, BRS was significantly reduced (p = 0.001) as was HRV (p = 0.007) and left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.022). The strongest association between any variable (including HRV, BRS, late potentials, left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise testing, Q waves, and infarct site) and the induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was depressed BRS with a relative risk of 36.28 (95% confidence interval, 5-266). CONCLUSIONS. This study confirms that depressed BRS identifies a subgroup at high risk for arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction and that programmed ventricular stimulation may be safely limited to this group without any loss of predictive accuracy.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Giant cell myocarditis has rarely been diagnosed premortem, and little is known about its natural history. In addition, no comparative studies with lymphocytic myocarditis exist. METHODS AND RESULTS. The clinical features, serial change in left ventricular fraction (LVEF), and outcomes of all patients with histologically verified myocarditis were retrospectively evaluated. Ten patients (22%) were found to have giant cell myocarditis (group 1), whereas the remaining 36 (78%) had lymphocytic myocarditis (group 2). Age at presentation, gender distribution, duration of symptoms, initial LVEF, and resting hemodynamics did not differ between groups. Ventricular tachycardia was detected in 90% of group 1 patients compared with only 25% of group 2 (p = 0.0007). Atrioventricular block that required pacemaker insertion was also more common in group 1 (60%) than in group 2 (8.3%) (p = 0.001). Left ventricular systolic function declined during follow-up in group 1 patients (LVEF, 0.43 +/- 0.07-0.26 +/- 0.05, p = 0.11) but increased in group 2 patients (LVEF, 0.33 +/- 0.03-0.41 +/- 0.03, p = 0.02). When the net change between initial and final LVEF was assessed, a significant difference was evident (giant cell group, -0.17 +/- 0.06; lymphocytic group, +0.07 +/- 0.03; p = 0.0008). Although a greater proportion of patients in group 1 died or required transplantation (seven of 10 versus 11 of 36, p = 0.03), actuarial survival over 4 years was not different for the giant cell group (50%) than for the lymphocytic group (62%). CONCLUSION. Giant cell myocarditis was more prevalent than previously recognized and highly associated with both ventricular tachycardia and pacemaker requirement. The likelihood of an adverse event, either cardiovascular mortality or cardiac transplantation, was significantly greater for patients with giant cell myocarditis than for those with lymphocytic myocarditis, perhaps because of the progressive decline in left ventricular systolic function that was observed in those with giant cell myocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Contraction of obliquely oriented left ventricular (LV) fibers results in a twisting motion of the left ventricle. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of acute human cardiac allograft rejection on LV twist pattern and the twist-volume relation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Tantalum markers were implanted into the LV midwall in 15 transplant recipients to measure time-varying, three-dimensional chamber twist using computer-assisted analysis of biplane cinefluoroscopic images. Twist was defined as the mean longitudinal gradient of circumferential rotation about the LV long axis. When plotted against normalized percent ejection fraction (%EF), the resulting twist-normalized %EF relation could be divided into three phases. In systole, LV twist was linearly related to ejection of blood. In contrast, diastolic untwist was characterized by early rapid recoil with little change in LV volume, followed by more gradual untwisting when the bulk of diastolic filling occurred. During 10 acute rejection episodes in 10 patients, maximum twist, peak systolic twist rate, and the slope of the systolic twist-normalized %EF relation did not change. In contrast, the slope of the early (first 15% of filling) diastolic twist-normalized %EF relation (M(early-dia)) decreased significantly (-0.194 +/- 0.062 [prerejection] versus -0.103 +/- 0.054 rad/cm [rejection], p = 0.0003), resulting in a prolonged tau 1/2 (time required to untwist by 50% [20 +/- 5% versus 28 +/- 5% of diastole], p = 0.0003) and decrease in percent untwisting at 15% diastolic LV filling (62 +/- 11% versus 36 +/- 13%, p = 0.0003). Therefore, a greater proportion of LV untwisting occurred later in diastole during rejection, as reflected by an increase in the slope (M(mid-dia)) of the middle to late (from 15 to 90% filling) diastolic twist-normalized %EF relation (-0.018 +/- 0.009 versus -0.030 +/- 0.010 rad/cm, p = 0.0015). Peak rate of untwist was not affected. With resolution of rejection, M(early-dia) and percent untwist during early diastole returned to baseline levels (p = NS versus baseline). There was also a trend for M(mid-dia) to return toward prerejection values (p = NS versus baseline), but this change did not reach statistical significance compared with rejection values. CONCLUSION. Acute cardiac allograft rejection is associated with altered diastolic twist mechanics in the absence of any demonstratable systolic abnormalities. During rejection, myocardial edema and other factors may result in intrinsic changes of the elastic properties of the myocardium, thereby leading to modification of recoil forces responsible for the early, rapid unwinding of the deformed ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The use of radioactive microspheres (RM) for the measurement of regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) is limited and inaccessible to many investigators due to radiation safety concerns and radioactive waste disposal problems. Therefore, a new method for the measurement of RMBF using colored microspheres (CM) was developed. METHODS AND RESULTS. Polystyrene spheres (diameter, 15 +/- 0.1 [SD] micron; density, 1.09 g/ml) were dyed with one of five colors. With the injection of CM into the left atrium or into a coronary perfusion line, RMBF and its distribution can be determined. CM are extracted from the myocardium and blood by digestion with potassium hydroxide and subsequent microfiltration. The dyes are then recovered from the CM within a defined volume of a solvent, and their concentrations are determined by spectrophotometry. The separation of composite absorbance spectra by spectrophotometry with the CM technique was as good as the separation of energy spectra by a gamma-counter using the RM technique. Leaching of dye from the CM was less than 0.1% during a 2-month period in vitro. Significant leaching of dye from the microspheres also did not occur during 8 hours in the blood and myocardium of four anesthetized dogs in vivo. For further validation of this method, pairs of CM and RM (15.5 +/- 0.1 [SD] microns) were simultaneously injected under five different RMBF conditions (range, 0-10 ml/[min.g]) into the left anterior descending coronary artery of four anesthetized pigs, with coronary inflow as a flow reference, or into the left atrium of four anesthetized dogs using aortic blood withdrawal as a reference. The relation between RMBF determined by CM and RM was CM = 0.01 + 1.00.RM (r = 0.98, n = 1,080 data points) in the pigs, and CM = -0.19 + 0.92.RM (r = 0.97, n = 1,813 data points) in the dogs. CONCLUSIONS. Measurement of RMBF with CM yields values very similar to those of RM. Their use is less expensive and avoids all the disadvantages related to radioactivity, thus offering an alternative method for as many as five RMBF measurements in a single experiment.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We report that rapid atrial pacing interrupts atrial flutter when the orthodromic wave front from the pacing impulse is blocked in an area of slow conduction in the reentry circuit. To characterize the area of slow conduction during atrial flutter and rapid pacing, we studied 11 episodes of induced atrial flutter, mean cycle length 157 +/- 20 msec, in eight dogs with sterile pericarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Atrial electrograms were recorded simultaneously from 95 pairs of right atrial electrodes during the interruption of atrial flutter by rapid atrial pacing, mean cycle length 139 +/- 21 msec. Areas of slow conduction during atrial flutter were demonstrated at one to three sites in the reentry circuit. After rapid pacing captured the reentry circuit, one area of slow conduction either disappeared (10 episodes) or the degree of slow conduction in an area of slow conduction decreased (one episode). Both changes were in association with activation of the region by a wave front from the pacing impulse that arrived from a direction different than that during the induced atrial flutter. Interruption of atrial flutter during rapid pacing occurred when the orthodromic wave front from the pacing impulse blocked in an area of slow conduction that had either newly evolved during rapid pacing (seven episodes) or that was previously present (four episodes). CONCLUSIONS. Areas of slow conduction present during atrial flutter and rapid pacing of atrial flutter are functional and depend on both the atrial rate and the direction of the circulating wave fronts. Interruption of atrial flutter by rapid pacing results from block of the orthodromic wave front of the pacing impulse in an area of slow conduction in the reentry circuit.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Evidence supporting the role of xanthine oxidase in myocardial reperfusion injury is based on studies with pharmacological interventions used to inhibit enzyme function. Controversy exists, however, regarding the true role of xanthine oxidase in reperfusion injury. This study was performed to determine whether xanthine oxidase inhibition limits myocardial injury due to coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. METHODS AND RESULTS. Anesthetized dogs underwent coronary artery occlusion (90 minutes) and reperfusion (6 hours). Oxypurinol (28 mg/kg) or amflutizole (30 mg/kg), chemically unrelated inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, or vehicle was infused intravenously 15 minutes before and 3 hours after reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined with radiolabeled microspheres. Infarct size was determined with the tetrazolium method. Myocardial infarct size (percent of risk region) was less in oxypurinol-treated dogs, 32 +/- 16%, compared with that of the control group, 46 +/- 15%. Infarct size for the amflutizole-treated dogs, 40 +/- 21%, was not significantly different from that of the control group. There were no differences in rate-pressure product or collateral blood flow to account for differences in infarct size. Uric acid concentration in the coronary venous plasma increased after reperfusion in the dogs treated with vehicle but not in the drug-treated dogs. Xanthine oxidase inhibition was demonstrated in each of the drug treatment groups, but only oxypurinol limited the extent of myocardial injury. CONCLUSIONS. Previously reported cardioprotective effects of allopurinol, noted to occur only when the drug was administered chronically, may be related to a property of oxypurinol, a major metabolite of allopurinol. The beneficial effect of oxypurinol is unrelated to inhibition of superoxide formation during xanthine oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of xanthine and hypoxanthine.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, within patient double-blind study. SETTING: ICU or coronary care unit patients in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty (23 cardiac surgery, ten acute myocardial infarction, and seven general intensive care) seriously ill patients with severe symptomatic bradycardia. INTERVENTION: Initial randomization of patients to receive either a pacing mode where atrioventricular synchronization was maintained (atrioventricular pacing: atrial demand, atrioventricular sequential, atrioventricular universal) or a mode of pacing where atrioventricular synchrony was not preserved (ventricular demand pacing). MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The cardiac output increased from a mean of 4.5 +/- 1.7 L/min (95% confidence intervals: 4.0 to 5.0 L/min) during ventricular demand pacing to 5.3 +/- 1.7 L/min (95% confidence intervals: 4.9 to 5.9 L/min) during atrioventricular pacing (p less than .0001) despite trivial decreases in CVP from 14 +/- 4 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 13 to 15 mm Hg) to 13 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 12 to 15 mm Hg) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure from 18 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 16 to 20 mm Hg) to 17 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 15 to 18 mm Hg). At the same time, mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased from 74 +/- 15 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 64 to 79 mm Hg) to 83 +/- 15 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 80 to 88 mm Hg) and left ventricular stroke work index from 22 +/- 10 g.m/m2 (95% confidence intervals: 19 to 25 g.m/m2) to 30 +/- 11 g.m/m2 (95% confidence intervals: 26 to 33 g.m/m2). There was no significant change in mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance index, or systemic vascular resistance index. CONCLUSION: When cardiac pacing is required in critically ill patients, maintaining atrioventricular synchrony increases stroke volume, cardiac output, and MAP apparently with minimal effects on preload and afterload.\r"

DESIGN: A retrospective case series analysis of data collected from patient charts and trauma registry. SETTING: A Level I regional trauma center that is part of a statewide trauma system. PATIENTS: Over a 3-yr period, 87 patients (3% of all trauma ICU admissions) had prolonged stays (greater than 30 days) in the ICU; they constitute the study group. Blunt trauma was responsible for 90% of injuries, and the mean Injury Severity Score was 34 +/- 16 SD. RESULTS: Mechanical ventilation was required for 78.5% of the time spent in the ICU. The mean time spent on mechanical ventilators was 47 +/- 23 days; in the ICU, 60 +/- 27 days; and in the hospital, 72 +/- 29 days. Infectious complications occurred in 90% and organ dysfunction was seen in 76% of patients. The overall mortality rate was 17.2% (31% for patients greater than 65 yr). Patients less than 40 yr had lower mortality rates despite a significantly higher Injury Severity Score and lower Glasgow Coma Scale score compared with those greater than 65 yr. More patients greater than 65 yr were discharged to chronic care facilities than those younger (23% vs. 5%). The number of patients followed at 3 and 12 months after discharge was 74% and 54%, respectively, with only two deaths. The mean hospital and professional charges to the patients were $101,000 +/- 61,000 and $35,000 +/- 13,000, respectively. CONCLUSION: Length of ICU stay was most closely associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. The presence of premorbid illness, age greater than 65 yr, and organ dysfunction was associated with increased mortality. Although trauma patients requiring prolonged ICU stays utilize many resources, the ultimate outcome may be fairly good.\r"

SETTING: The Burn and Trauma ICUs at Harborview Medical Center from March to September 1989. PATIENTS: Children were eligible for the study if they were less than 15 yr old, were intubated for greater than 12 hr, and did not have underlying cardiopulmonary disease. The study included 25 patients with 30 extubations. RISK FACTORS ASSESSED: Age, type of injury (burn vs. trauma), location of intubation (\"field\" vs. hospital), endotracheal tube size, length of intubation, and presence of an airleak around the tube at the time of extubation at 30 cm H2O pressure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Moderate to severe postextubation stridor requiring treatment with racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen, reintubation, or tracheostomy. RESULTS: Treatment for postextubation stridor was required after 11 (37%) of 30 extubations, with five reintubations and one tracheostomy. The best predictor of postextubation stridor was absence of an airleak at the time of extubation (sensitivity 100%, positive predictive value 79%, p less than .001), followed by type of injury (facial burn vs. all others; sensitivity 64%, positive predictive value 88%, p less than .001). After controlling for these two factors, no other factor studied was a significant predictor of postextubation stridor. CONCLUSION: In pediatric trauma patients, mechanism of injury (facial burn vs. other) and absence of an airleak at the time of extubation are the strongest factors predicting postextubation stridor. Patients with one or both risk factors require special attention to airway management.\r"

PATIENTS: Children less than 15 yr old who were electively extubated and had symptoms of postextubation stridor, but required less than or equal to 35% oxygen. INTERVENTION: Each treatment (helium-oxygen and oxygen-supplemented room air) was given in random order for 15 min after extubation. MEASUREMENTS: Respiratory distress was assessed by a physician blinded to treatment order using a standard stridor score and clinical judgment. RESULTS: There were 13 children with 15 extubations; seven (47%) of 15 patients required subsequent treatment with racemic epinephrine or reintubation. Stridor scores were lower with helium-oxygen than with oxygen-supplemented room air (2.8 vs. 3.7, p less than .005), and helium-oxygen was preferred in eight of nine trials in which one treatment was clearly favored by the physician. CONCLUSION: Because helium-oxygen therapy can reduce stridor scores and is clinically preferred by physicians caring for stridorous children, it may be a useful adjunctive therapy in pediatric trauma patients with postextubation stridor.\r"

DESIGN: Paired simple randomized, with continuous interval data in dependent variable and both continuous and nominal independent variables. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 195) were anesthetized and both hind limbs occluded for 3.75 hr, the overnight LD50. Alveolar lavage was performed on the animals 1 hr after reperfusion or on survivors 20 hr after reperfusion. Groups were either undosed or pretreated with alpha-tocopherol as an antioxidant (50 mg/kg.day) 2 days before ischemia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence was measured in both phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated and unstimulated macrophages. Nanomoles of superoxide radicals per 10(6) alveolar cells/min were also measured using a cytochrome c reduction assay. A significant (p less than .01, Student's t-test), time-dependent increase in response of cells from ischemic-reperfused rats was seen. Pretreatment with antioxidant had no effect at 1 hr, but significant differences were seen in the 20-hr survivors. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that alveolar lavage cells, 95% macrophages, reflect the reperfusion of ischemic-reperfused hind limbs by a significant increase in oxygen radical activity, an effect partly suppressed in antioxidant-dosed survivors.\r"

Twenty-four endotracheally intubated mongrel dogs (18 to 24 kg) underwent a 30-min period of hemorrhagic shock, from time 0 to 30 min into the shock period, followed by fluid resuscitation. Data were collected at baseline, 15 min into the shock period, immediately after fluid infusion, 5 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and at 60-min intervals for 2 hr, (65 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and 125 min after the beginning of resuscitation). The animals received one of four randomly assigned iv resuscitation fluids: saline (54 mL/kg), hypertonic saline (6.0 mL/kg), hydroxyethel starch (6.0 mL/kg) or hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch (6.0 mL/kg). RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure increased in all groups after resuscitation. Cardiac output increased with resuscitation in all groups, exceeding baseline in the saline and hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch groups (p less than .05 compared with hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch). Sixty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, cardiac output was significantly (p less than .05) greater in either of the two colloid-containing groups than in the hypertonic saline group. After resuscitation, hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch produced minimal improvements in hepatic arterial flow, hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch increased hepatic arterial flow to near baseline levels, and saline markedly increased hepatic arterial flow to levels exceeding baseline (p less than .05, saline vs. hydroxyethyl starch). One hundred twenty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, hepatic arterial flow had decreased in all groups; hepatic arterial flow in the hypertonic saline group had decreased to levels comparable with those during shock. Myocardial, renal, and brain blood flow were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Small-volume resuscitation with the combination of hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch is comparable with much larger volumes of 0.8% saline, and is equal to hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch in the ability to restore and sustain BP and improve organ blood flow after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is feasible in a neonatal animal model with acute lung injury. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, repeated, bracketed measures. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Seven neonatal sheep (5.6 +/- 0.6 kg), less than 10 days of age. INTERVENTIONS: Acute lung injury was induced by oleic acid infusion and cardiorespiratory profiles were compared during spontaneous ventilation at ambient airway pressure, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), APRV, and conventional positive-pressure ventilation (PPV). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Oleic acid resulted in acute lung injury with stable cardiorespiratory status during the 3-hr study period. Mean airway pressure (Paw) was comparable for all three positive-pressure modes (CPAP 13.4 +/- 1.5, APRV 13.5 +/- 1.4, PPV 13.9 +/- 1.4 cm H2O, NS). After acute lung injury, CPAP increased arterial oxygenation compared with spontaneous ventilation (77.3 +/- 6.9 vs. 57.7 +/- 4.2 torr [10.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.7 +/- 0.6 kPa], p less than .05), and this increase was maintained during APRV (73.3 +/- 5.6 vs. 77.3 +/- 6.9 torr [9.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.9 kPa], NS). Alveolar ventilation was increased by APRV compared with CPAP (PaCO2 29 +/- 1 vs. 41 +/- 2 torr [3.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.3 kPa], p less than .05) without impairment of cardiovascular performance (cardiac output 1.18 +/- 0.16 vs. 1.20 +/- 0.17 L/min, NS). To achieve ventilation equivalent to APRV during PPV, peak Paw was greater (36.4 +/- 3.2 vs. 19.7 +/- 1.7 cm H2O, p less than .05) and cardiac output (0.94 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.18 +/- 0.16 L/min, p less than .05) and mean arterial pressure (91 +/- 7 vs. 96 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than .05) were decreased during PPV compared with APRV. CONCLUSIONS: In this neonatal laboratory model of acute lung injury, APRV maintained oxygenation and augmented alveolar ventilation compared with CPAP. Compared with PPV, APRV provided similar ventilation and oxygenation, but at lower peak Paw than PPV, without compromising cardiovascular performance.\r"

After ventricular fibrillation with no flow of 10 min, and standard external CPR with epinephrine (low flow) from ventricular fibrillation time of 10 to 15 min, defibrillation and restoration of spontaneous normotension were between ventricular fibrillation time of 16 and 20 min. This procedure was followed by controlled ventilation to 20 hr postarrest and intensive care to 72 hr postarrest. In control group 1 (n = 10), core temperature was 37.5 degrees C; in control group 2 (n = 10), cooling was started immediately after restoration of spontaneous normotension; and in group 3 (n = 10), cooling was initiated with start of CPR. Cooling was by clinically feasible methods. RESULTS: Best overall performance categories achieved (1 = normal; 5 = brain death) were better in group 2 (p = .012) and group 3 (p = .005) than in group 1. Best neurologic deficit scores were 36 +/- 14% in group 1, 22 +/- 15% in group 2 (p = .02), and 19 +/- 18% in group 3 (p = .01). Brain histopathologic damage scores were also lower (better) in groups 2 (p = .05) and 3 (p = .03). Myocardial damage was the same in all three groups.

DESIGN: Young (4 to 6 wk old) and adult rabbits were ventilated for 1 hr at PIPs of 15, 30, and either 45 cm H2O (young group) or 55 cm H2O (adult group). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pulmonary capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) was measured in an isolated lung perfusion system after the animals were killed. In young rabbits, Kf,c increased significantly from the 15 cm H2O PIP value in both the 30 cm H2O (55%) and 45 cm H2O (507%) PIP groups, whereas Kf,c was increased in adult rabbits only in the 55 cm H2O (113%) PIP group. Kf,c was significantly (p less than .01) higher in young rabbits than in adult rabbits after ventilation, with every level of PIP being 91% higher at 15 cm H2O PIP and 440% higher at 45 to 55 cm H2O PIP. Also, a greater incidence of pneumothorax and airleaks was observed in the young rabbits. Pressure-volume loops demonstrated that the young rabbits had more compliant lungs and chest wall than adult rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the lungs of young rabbits had a higher baseline microvascular permeability and were more susceptible to the development of ventilator-induced increased microvascular permeability. More compliant lungs and chest wall and the larger distending volumes attained at each peak airway pressure appear to be the mechanisms.\r"

Six animals were treated with high-frequency jet ventilation at 400 breaths/min and seven animals with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation at 900 breaths/min. RESULTS: Peak airway pressure, Paw, mean Paw, and end-expiratory pressure requirements were significantly higher for high-frequency oscillatory ventilation as compared with high-frequency jet ventilation for similar gas exchange (p less than .01). While in vivo estimates of airway humidification suggested progressively greater H2O delivery into the respirator circuit, and therefore the airway, with higher frequencies, the in vitro study suggested similar relative humidities of the delivered gases during both types of mechanical ventilation. Tracheal injury, measured using a semiquantitative scoring system, was scored similarly for both ventilators studied despite the higher pressure requirements seen with the high-frequency oscillator. CONCLUSIONS: In this animal model, high-frequency ventilation using either jet or oscillation techniques produced similar inflammatory tracheal damage despite differences in Paw exposure and humidity.\r"

DESIGN: Sham-controlled laboratory investigation on Goettingen minipigs. INTERVENTIONS: Induction of acute respiratory failure by a 4-hr infusion of live Escherichia coli bacteria in 11 animals; two animals served as the control group. Anesthesia was obtained with methohexital/piritramide and pancuronium bromide. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cardiac output and pressures were measured by means of femoral artery, pulmonary artery, and left atrial catheters. Arterial-alveolar Po2 ratio was calculated to evaluate pulmonary function. Measurements were obtained before and after 1 and 2 hr of the E. coli infusion. Statistical significance was tested with analysis of variance. E. coli infusion caused the hypodynamic shock and respiratory failure. The PAOP-LAP gradient was -0.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg before bacteremia and increased significantly (p less than .001) to 2.9 +/- 1.8 and 3.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg after 1 and 2 hr of bacteremia, respectively. No significant changes occurred in the sham group. CONCLUSIONS: A PAOP-LAP gradient may develop during acute respiratory failure. Therefore, pulmonary venous vascular resistance may be underestimated if its determination is based on PAOP. An increase in bronchial to pulmonary blood flow and pulmonary venoconstriction are discussed as hypothetical causes of a PAOP-LAP gradient during acute respiratory failure.\r"

Our study was designed to continuously monitor the following variables in five swine: systemic and pulmonary pressure; mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2); minute oxygen consumption and CO2 production before, during, and for 4 hr after the infusion of oleic acid. A personal computer was programmed to produce 20-sec updates of deadspace ratio (VD/VT), venous admixture (Qsp/Qt), pulmonary (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and cardiac output (Qt) from these data. RESULTS: During the oleic acid infusion, there were increases in PVR, SVR, heart rate (HR), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), Qsp/Qt, and VD/VT, and a decrease in Qt, SaO2, and SVO2. Thirty minutes after the oleic acid infusion, there was a further increase in HR, Qsp/Qt, and VD/VT, while MPAP, PVR, and SVR gradually decreased to pre-oleic acid infusion levels. No further decrease in SaO2, SVO2, and Qt was observed during that time. After the 30-min period, there was no further change in the cardiopulmonary variables. CONCLUSION: Our method of continuous monitoring was able to demonstrate in swine both the dynamic changes during, and stability after, the oleic acid infusion.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized prospective trial. SETTING: Laboratory investigation. SUBJECTS: Adolescent female pigs weighing approximately 30 kg. INTERVENTIONS: We compared diafiltered 6% pentastarch with 6% high molecular weight hetastarch for volume maintenance in a porcine model of fecal peritonitis. The number average molecular weight of pentastarch is higher than hetastarch, although the weight average molecular weight is lower, i.e., a narrow range of medium weight molecules. The infusion rate of each agent was adjusted to maintain baseline arterial Hct for less than or equal to 7 hr after instrumentation and induction of fecal peritonitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The volume of fluid required to maintain arterial Hct was compared along with comparisons of hemodynamic and histologic responses associated with the two agents. RESULTS: Significantly less pentastarch was required to prevent hemoconcentration than hetastarch (109 +/- 22.8 vs. 150 +/- 10.3 mL/kg; p less than .05) while hemodynamics, colloid osmotic pressure, and oxygen transport responses were similar. Capillary patency was greater (21.99 +/- 3.68 vs. 10.09 +/- 1.17%; p less than .05) and mean alveolar capillary barrier thickness was less (2.36 +/- 0.13 vs. 3.06 +/- 0.17 microns; p less than .05) with pentastarch than with hetastarch, as judged by electron microscopy.

This study was performed to examine the effects of catheter position on thermodilution RVEF measurements. Six pigs (80 to 100 kg) were instrumented with an RV thermodilution catheter in the pulmonary artery, an injectate catheter in the right atrium, an atrial pacing electrode, and a systemic arterial catheter. RVEF measurements were determined using thermodilution in two ways: a) with incremental increases in pulmonary valve to thermistor distance; and b) with incremental increases in injectate port to tricuspid valve distance. These measurements were obtained at a paced rate of 102 +/- 2 beats/min and then repeated with pacing-induced tachycardia (140 beats/min). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in thermodilution RVEF measurements with the thermistor positioned 0 to 10 cm from the pulmonary valve at either heart rate. A significant reduction in RVEF occurred with the injection port located 5 to 7 cm proximal to the tricuspid valve, with this decrease becoming more pronounced during tachycardia. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that RVEF measurements can be reliably obtained using thermodilution. In these large hearts, thermodilution RVEF measurements appear to be independent of thermistor position within the pulmonary artery. However, large distances from injectate port to tricuspid valve reduced RVEF measurements.\r"

PATIENTS: Surgical ICU patients requiring invasive hemodynamic monitoring. INTERVENTIONS: Eight patients received PA catheters modified to include a right ventricular (RV) pressure monitoring port located 7 cm from the tip. Fifteen patients received catheters with an RV port located 10 cm from the tip. Guided by the RV port pressure waveform, catheters were initially positioned so that the RV port was located just proximal to the pulmonic valve. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure (PAOP) could not be obtained in six of the eight patients receiving the 7-cm RV port catheter unless the RV port was advanced into the PA. PAOP was consistently obtained in all 15 patients receiving the 10-cm RV port catheter, with the RV port positioned in the RV. Chest radiographs confirmed a central PA catheter position. In this group, distal migration of the catheter occurred 14 times in eight patients, as detected by appearance of a PA pressure waveform at the RV port. Distal migration was corrected by withdrawal of the catheter until an RV waveform reappeared at the RV port. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that distal catheter migration occurs frequently with PA monitoring catheters, but can be detected at the bedside with a catheter modified to include an RV port 10 cm from the tip. This new catheter may add a margin of safety to PA monitoring and lower its overall cost by eliminating the need for chest radiographs ordered solely to confirm catheter tip location.\r"
