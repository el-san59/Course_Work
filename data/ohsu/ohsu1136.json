  ".W": "Cyclosporin therapy is associated with several forms of nephrotoxicity, the most significant of which are reversible impairment of glomerular filtration and irreversible interstitial fibrosis. Impaired glomerular filtration is due to both reduction in Kf, the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient, and to reduction in renal blood flow. The mechanisms responsible for the low Kf are not well defined, but heightened mesangial cell contractility may contribute. Reduced renal blood flow with chronic cyclosporin therapy arises from both endothelial damage and altered eicosanoid metabolism, in particular increased thromboxane synthesis. Renal interstitial fibrosis, which develops in some patients after approximately 6-12 months of cyclosporin therapy, poses a major limitation to the chronic use of the drug. Two mechanisms likely contribute to cyclosporin-associated interstitial fibrosis. First, endothelial injury and vasoconstriction produce renal ischemia, which in turn is associated with enhanced synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. Second, cyclosporin likely influences the accumulation of matrix proteins in the renal interstitium through nonhemodynamic mechanisms, as suggested by altered matrix accumulation in non-renal tissues. This effect of cyclosporin may be direct or indirect, via mediators including cytokines, peptide growth factors, and thromboxane. The molecular mechanisms of cyclosporin action on immunologic and mesenchymal cells are active areas of investigation. Intracellular targets of cyclosporin include mitochondrial respiration, cellular calcium signaling, protein kinase C, protein synthesis, and peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. However, the significance of these intracellular effects for cyclosporin nephrotoxicity remains to be demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "A blunted pressure natriuretic response is present in Dahl salt sensitive rats. To determine whether this results from tubular or glomerular mechanisms, late proximal, early distal, and late distal micropuncture were performed in salt resistant (R), salt sensitive (S), or salt sensitive rats with renal perfusion reduced to that of R rats (S-AC). Differences in neuro-endocrine background between groups were eliminated by renal denervation and by fixing plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, and vasopressin levels by infusion. Renal perfusion pressure was greater (P less than 0.05) and inulin clearance less (P less than 0.05) in S than R rats. Urinary sodium excretion, however, was not different. S-AC had renal perfusion pressures that were similar to R rats and inulin clearance similar to S rats. Urinary NaCl excretion was less (P less than 0.05) than either group. Single nephron inulin clearance, fluid, and chloride delivery to late proximal sites were not different between groups. Absolute and fractional chloride delivery to early distal sites was less (P less than 0.05) in S-AC than R or S but not different between R and S. Late distal chloride delivery was not different between any group. Calculated loop chloride reabsorption was greater in S-AC than R or S. Thus, the lower urinary NaCl excretion in S-AC rats is in part due to increased loop chloride reabsorption. This effect is probably intrinsic to the S kidney as it occurs despite renal denervation when plasma levels of vasopressin, norepinephrine, and aldosterone are fixed. The increased loop chloride uptake is abolished when perfusion pressure increases.\r"

This study characterizes the concentration-dependent binding of uric acid crystals to rat renal inner medullary collecting duct cells in primary culture. Collecting duct cell cultures grew as monolayers with interspersed aggregates of rounded cells. Cultures were incubated with 14C-uric acid crystals, and the crystals that bound were quantitated by adherent radioactivity. Uric acid crystal adherence demonstrated concentration dependent saturation with a 1/alpha value (maximum micrograms of crystals adhering to 1 cm2 of binding area) of 645 micrograms/cm2. The beta values (fraction of cross-sectional area which bound crystals) of uric acid (mean = 0.15) and calcium oxalate monohydrate (mean = 0.13) crystals did not differ significantly. Uric acid crystal binding was inhibited by pre-bound calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals in a concentration dependent manner. These data suggest that uric acid and calcium oxalate crystals exhibit similar binding patterns to rat renal inner medullary collecting duct cells in primary culture.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that such tight homeostatic regulation is an artifact of eating a culturally imposed NaCl-enriched diet, not a fundamental physiological trait of humans. In five normal men ingesting a constant acid-producing diet with a low intrinsic NaCl content (0.15 mEq/kg of body weight per day), we measured plasma and urine acid-base composition during four 7-day periods in which the diet was supplemented as follows: no supplements----NaHCO3 only----NaHCO3 plus NaCl----NaCl only. Each sodium supplement was 2.0 mmol/kg body weight per day. With no supplements, pHb was 7.43 +/- 0.005 and (HCO3-)p was 25.0 +/- 0.4 mEq/L. When NaHCO3 only was added, pHb rose 0.02 (to 7.45 +/- 0.004; P less than 0.01) and (HCO3-)p rose nearly 4 mEq/L (to 28.9 +/- 0.6 mEq/L, P less than 0.001). The rise in (HCO3-)p was sustained predominantly by an increased rate of renal bicarbonate reabsorption. When NaCl was added, (HCO3-)p returned to the earlier level, despite continued NaHCO3 supplementation (24.9 +/- 0.6 mEq/L), and remained there when NaHCO3 supplementation was subsequently stopped (24.1 +/- 0.5 mEq/L). Thus, tight homeostatic regulation of plasma acid-base composition in response to a change in dietary base occurred only when dietary NaCl was abundant. To our knowledge, this is the first study in normal humans that demonstrates that diet NaCl variations within the normal range significantly influence plasma acid-base composition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The decreased phosphaturic response to parathyroid hormone in rats fed a low phosphate diet for 1 day can be restored by propranolol infusion. Free-flow micropuncture studies were performed to localize the nephron site of restoration of the phosphaturic effect of parathyroid hormone by propranolol in rats deprived of phosphate for one day. In animals fed low phosphate diet and in the presence of parathyroid hormone, propranolol infusion did not change phosphate delivery to the late proximal tubule; however, fractional delivery of phosphate to the early distal tubule was significantly increased from 18.3 +/- 2.9 to 32.2 +/- 4.1%. In rats fed a normal phosphate diet, propranolol infusion did not change phosphate delivery along the nephron. We conclude that the restoration of the phosphaturic effect of parathyroid hormone by propranolol infusion in rats deprived of phosphate for 1 day is primarily due to decreased reabsorption of phosphate by superficial loop segments, most likely the pars recta segment of the proximal tubule.\r"

To evaluate the possible contribution of the reduced glomerular filtration rate of hypothyroidism to these abnormalities, tubular function in hypothyroid patients was compared with that in patients with chronic renal failure and in normal subjects. The lithium clearance method and oral water loading were used to evaluate parameters of tubular sodium and water handling, respectively. The hypothyroid and the chronic renal failure patients were selected to have similar reductions in glomerular filtration rate. As compared to the normal subjects, the hypothyroid and chronic renal failure patients had a decrease in proximal sodium reabsorption and an increase in distal sodium reabsorption. The changes in tubular handling of sodium were not different in the hypothyroid and the chronic renal failure patients. Maximal urinary flow rate and free water clearances were similarly reduced in the hypothyroid patients and the chronic renal failure patients. For all subjects studied, proximal sodium reabsorption and maximal urinary volume were directly correlated with the glomerular filtration rate, and distal nephron sodium reabsorption was proportionate to delivery of sodium from the proximal tubule. The results suggest that the abnormalities in tubular sodium and water handling in hypothyroid patients are comparable to those present in other patients with a similar degree of renal insufficiency. Thus, the tubular abnormalities in hypothyroidism may be a consequence of the associated decrease in glomerular filtration rate.\r"

Isolated nonperfused proximal S2 segments from rabbit kidney cortex were studied in vitro. Gradual lowering of osmolality from 295 to 150 mOsm/kg at a rate of 2 mOsm/kg/min did not cause an increase in tubule cell volume until the medium osmolality decreased below 190 mOsm/kg. By contrast, tubules rapidly bathed in low osmolality media exhibited classical osmometric swelling followed by incomplete volume regulatory decrease. Volume regulation associated with gradual and rapid lowering of osmolality was accompanied by the net loss of intracellular K+, Na+, and Cl- (measured by electron probe); however, the temporal pattern of electrolyte loss depended on the rate of osmotic change. With gradual lowering of osmolality, cell K+ content did not decrease significantly until osmolality was lowered below 200 mOsm/kg, whereas Cl- was lost at the 200 mOsm/kg level and below. With rapid lowering of osmolality, cell K+ content was strikingly decreased at the 200 mOsm/kg level, but Cl- did not change appreciably until osmolality was decreased to 150 mOsm/kg. Cell Na+ content decreased in hypo-osmotic media, but the magnitude was relatively small. During volume regulation that accompanied either gradual or rapid lowering of medium osmolality from 295 to 150 mOsm/kg, intracellular osmolal gap, the difference between medium osmolality and the sum of intracellular concentrations of K+, Na+, and Cl- decreased 87 and 58 mOsm/kg, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lymphocytes were obtained from 37 normal subjects and 21 dialysis patients. S. aureus Cowan I induced significant stimulation (P less than 0.01) of the proliferation of B cells from both groups, but the effect was smaller on B cells from dialysis patients (10.0 x 10(3) +/- 1.4 x 10(3) cpm) than on those from normal subjects (21.8 x 10(3) +/- 2.0 x 10(3) cpm).

Colchicine significantly reduced the rise in serum creatinine (serum creatinine = 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg% in vehicle-treated animals versus 1.8 +/- 0.1 mg% in colchicine-treated animals) and interstitial fibrosis (fibrosis score = 2.6 +/- 0.2 in vehicle-treated versus 1.5 +/- 0.2 in colchicine-treated animals). Colchicine treatment did not significantly affect weight, anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin level, % fibrocellular crescents formed, hydroxyproline per gram (dry weight) in tissue, or urine protein: creatine ratio. Regression analysis was performed to examine the interrelationships between variables for all animals and the effect of colchicine on pairs of variables. No clear-cut site of colchicine action could be identified. These data show that colchicine, in doses that could be used in humans, protected renal function by about 25% and reduced interstitial fibrosis in a model of severe crescentic nephritis.\r"

This maneuver increases sodium excretion in a manner not completely dependent on the renal nerves, suggesting that a humoral factor(s) could be involved. We measured sodium excretion before and after unilateral carotid artery traction or sham traction in anesthetized rats and related the results to the plasma concentration of immunoreactive (IR)-gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (gamma-MSH), a peptide known to be natriuretic in other circumstances. In 12 rats undergoing sham traction, sodium excretion did not change and plasma IR-gamma-MSH activity at the end of the experiment was 10.5 +/- 5.4 (SD) fmol/mL. Carotid artery fraction in 20 other rats caused a transient dip in mean arterial pressure of 20.1 +/- 13.2 mm Hg, and sodium excretion increased from 746 +/- 431 to 1,739 +/- 1,436 nEq/min (P less than 0.005). Plasma IR-gamma-MSH was increased to 21.1 +/- 7.1 fmol/mL (P less than 0.001 versus sham). Prior ipsilateral carotid sinus denervation markedly attenuated the carotid artery traction-related dip in blood pressure and prevented both the natriuresis and the increase in IR-gamma-MSH activity seen after this maneuver in intact rats. Pretreatment with anti-gamma-MSH antiserum also blocked the natriuretic response to carotid artery traction, despite a similar transient dip in blood pressure of 18.3 +/- 9.9 mm Hg. These observations suggest that activation of the carotid baroreceptor reflex by unilateral carotid artery traction causes natriuresis that is mediated largely by an increase in the plasma concentration of a peptide or peptides closely related to the gamma-MSH sequence.\r"

During the control period, tubules absorbed fluid at 0.68 +/- 0.05 nL/mm.min and glucose at 12.5 +/- 1.3 pmol/mm.min. After 10(-10) M angiotensin was added to the bath, tubules absorbed fluid at 0.82 +/- 0.06 nL/mm.min and glucose at 16.0 +/- 2.4 pmol/mm.min--a stimulation of both parameters by 30%. Time controls showed no significant change in the rate of glucose or fluid absorption. This stimulation was due to an increase in the maximum rate of transport. The maximum rate of glucose absorption with 5.5 mM in bath and perfusate increased from 14.5 +/- 1.6 pmol/mm.min to 18.5 +/- 1.4 pmol/mm.min after 10(-10) M angiotensin was added to the bath. In contrast, the Km for glucose did not change, since a solution containing 0.55 mM glucose (approximately Km) supported 63 +/- 6% of the maximum rate during the control period and 60 +/- 5% of the maximum rate after angiotensin was added to the bath. Angiotensin also had no effect on glucose permeability, which was (3.7 +/- 0.4) x 10(-6) cm/s before treatment and (3.8 +/- 0.4) x 10(-6) cm/s after treatment. From these data, it is concluded that: (1) angiotensin stimulates glucose absorption in the rat proximal straight tubule; (2) this stimulation is the result of an increase in the maximum rate of transport rather than a change in Km or permeability; and (3) stimulation of Na/glucose absorption by angiotensin accounts for a significant portion of the increase in fluid absorption caused by angiotensin.\r"

Sustained epithelial proliferation, intracavitary fluid accumulation, and extracellular matrix remodeling are central elements in a multistep process that leads to the formation and enlargement of cysts. MDCK cells suspended within medium-hydrated collagen gels grow to form spherical, monolayered, fluid-filled cysts that enlarge steadily. Vasopressin and other agents that increase intracellular levels of cAMP stimulate the rate of MDCK cyst growth and net fluid/solute secretion when added to defined medium in vitro. In this model, net fluid secretion is the only means by which fluid can accumulate within the cyst cavity. We used this cyst-forming line of epithelial cells to evaluate several membrane transport properties that are important in the coupled movements of solute and water in the process of secretory fluid transport. Individual cysts were microdissected from collagen gels, held by a micropipet in a thermostated chamber, and examined at a high magnification by video microscopy. Transepithelial water flow was initiated by rapidly exchanging the bath medium with hyperosmotic solutions. Net water flux, Jv, determined from the initial rate of decrease in cyst diameter, was proportionate to the transmembrane osmotic gradient of NaCl or raffinose; the reflection coefficient for NaCl was indistinguishable from 1.0. Osmotic water permeability (cm3/cm2/osm/min x 10(-6)) was 739 +/- 99 (N = 11) in medium augmented by an NaCl concentration of 100 mosmol/kg. Hydraulic conductivity (Pt), estimated in control cysts, was 6.8 +/- 0.9 microns/s, a value similar to that of medullary and cortical thick ascending limbs of Henle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After serving in the clinical investigation units of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) he became deputy director of medical research at the RCAF headquarters in Ottawa. This was the post he held when he wrote the editorial \"Medical education for 1980,\" which is reprinted as our Encore selection for this issue, starting on page 665. After the war Dr. Gibson worked at the Montreal Neurological Institute until 1948 and then by a circuitous route went on to UBC as Kinsmen professor of neurologic research. Following a sabbatical year in Marseille in 1958, he was appointed professor of the history of medicine and science at UBC, a post he held until 1975. His \"retirement\" has hardly been quiet.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To quantify accurately the rate of adverse reactions after the preschool (fifth) dose of adsorbed diphtheria toxoid-pertussis vaccine-tetanus toxoid (DPT) vaccine and to test the hypothesis that large local reactions are attributable to the diphtheria toxoid. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Suburban community public health unit. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy children 4 to 5 years of age with a history of having received four doses of adsorbed DPT vaccine. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were given either the standard DPT vaccine (with 25 Lf units of diphtheria toxoid) or a modified DPT vaccine (with 10 Lf units of diphtheria toxoid). They were assessed 24 hours later by a nurse. Serum samples obtained before vaccination were tested for diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin levels by means of neutralization assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of large local reactions (an area of redness or swelling or both of 5 cm or greater) 24 hours after vaccination in the two groups. Relation between serum antitoxin levels before vaccination and the rate of large local reactions in each group. RESULTS: Of the 250 subjects enrolled 124 received the standard vaccine and 126 the modified one. Large local reactions occurred in 71% of the subjects receiving the standard vaccine and 52% of those receiving the modified one (p less than 0.01). In the former group large erythematous reactions occurred significantly more often in those with an elevated prevaccination diphtheria antitoxin level than in those without an elevated level; no relation was found between such reactions and the prevaccination tetanus antitoxin level. Reduced arm movement was evident in 45% of the children in the two groups. Few had systemic adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Large local reactions occur frequently after the preschool administration of the DPT vaccine. These reactions are uncomfortable but not serious. They result in part from the large amount of diphtheria toxoid in the standard DPT vaccine.\r"

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Five hospitals in the Montreal region. Virology testing was done at the Virology Research Centre, Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, Que. PATIENTS: Thirteen pregnant women infected with CMV, 3 with rubella, their 15 babies and 2 fetuses. Twelve of the women with CMV infection were recruited from a prospective study of CMV infection in pregnancy. Infection in the other women was detected through routine laboratory diagnostic testing. INTERVENTION: Amniotic fluid samples were cultured for CMV and rubella virus. Congenital infection of the neonates was established through isolation of either virus from pharyngeal mucus and urine specimens collected during the first 3 days of life or from fetal tissue if the pregnancy was terminated. MAIN RESULTS: CMV was cultured from the amniotic fluid of three of the CMV-infected women and from the pharyngeal mucus and urine specimens of their infants. Of the three women with rubella the amniotic fluid of one (who had a twin pregnancy) was positive for rubella virus. After the in-utero death of one fetus she underwent a therapeutic abortion of both. Examination of fetal tissue indicated that both fetuses had been infected with rubella virus. Each of the two other women with rubella gave birth to an uninfected, healthy infant. CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong correlation between the isolation of CMV or rubella virus from the amniotic fluid and the presence of congenital infection. This suggests that amniocentesis used to detect the presence of a virus is a useful method for the diagnosis of fetal infection.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1971 and 1974, 1665 women with primary operable breast cancer were randomized into a National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trial (B-04) conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of several different regimens of surgical and radiation therapy. No systemic therapy was given. Cells from archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue taken from 398 patients were analyzed for ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) using flow cytometry. Characteristics and outcome of patients with satisfactory DNA histograms were comparable to those from whom no satisfactory cytometric studies were available. In patients with diploid tumors (43%), the mean SPF was 3.4% +/- 2.3%; in the aneuploid population (57%), the SPF was 7.9% +/- 6.3%. Only 29.9% +/- 17.3% of cells in aneuploid tumors were aneuploid. Diploid tumors were more likely than aneuploid tumors to be of good nuclear grade (P less than 0.001) and smaller size (P equals 0.03). More tumors with high SPF were of poor nuclear grade than were tumors with low SPF (P equals 0.002). No significant difference in 10-year disease-free survival (P equals 0.3) or survival (P equals 0.1) was found between women with diploid or aneuploid tumors. Patients with low SPF tumors had a 13% better disease-free survival (P equals 0.0006) than those with a high SPF and a 14% better survival (P equals 0.007) at 10 years than patients with high SPF tumors. After adjustment for clinical tumor size, the difference in both disease-free survival and survival between patients with high and low SPF tumors was only 10% (P equals 0.04 and 0.08, respectively). Although SPF was found to be of independent prognostic significance for disease-free survival and marginal significance for survival, it did not detect patients with such a good prognosis as to preclude their receiving chemotherapy. The overall survival of patients with low SPF was only 53% at 10 years. These findings and those of others indicate that additional studies are necessary before tumor ploidy and SPF can be used to select patients who should or should not receive systemic therapy.\r"

A total of 258 patients had pathologic stage (PS) I or II disease, with 239 patients having Hodgkin's disease above the diaphragm (ADHD) and 19 patients having Hodgkin's disease below the diaphragm (BDHD). A comparison of patients with BDHD versus patients with ADHD showed that patients with BDHD were older (mean age, 42 versus 28 years of age, P = 0.005), were initially seen less often with nodular sclerosis subtype (32% versus 77%, P = 0.00001), and had a higher male: female ratio (2.8 versus 1.2, P = 0.12). Ten patients with BDHD (53%) had positive findings at staging laparotomy (0 of 4 clinical stage [CS] IA patients and 10 of 15 (67%) CS II patients). Radiation therapy alone was the initial treatment of choice for 74% of patients with BDHD versus 94% of the patients with ADHD. There was no statistical difference in the overall survival or relapse-free survival rates for patients with BDHD versus ADHD (10-year survival rates, BDHD = 73% and ADHD = 81%). However, patients with BDHD who initially had intra-abdominal disease had a statistically significant increase in death rate (60%) due to Hodgkin's disease compared with patients with BDHD who initially had only peripheral nodal disease (0%). Treatment recommendations for patients with BDHD should be tailored to the specific clinical presentation of each patient. For most PS IA/IIA patients initially seen with peripheral nodal disease, radiation therapy alone is a successful treatment program. However, combined modality therapy should be the treatment of choice for patients with BDHD initially seen with intra-abdominal disease.\r"

The first subset consisted of 48 patients (12% of the population) with tumors 1 cm or less in diameter that were well or moderately differentiated. These patients had a disease-free rate (DFR) of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94% to 100%). The second subset consisted of 35 patients (9% of the population) with tumors less than or equal to 1 cm that were poorly differentiated or anaplastic. These patients older than 50 years of age had a DFR of 97% (95% CI, 91% to 100%). The third subset consisted of 36 patients (9% of the population) with tumors 1.1 to 2 cm that were well or moderately differentiated. These patients were older than 50 years of age and had a DFR of 94% (95% CI, 85% to 100%). The fourth subset consisted of 36 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ with microscopic invasion. These patients had a DFR of 100% (95% CI, 87% to 100%). Twenty-two of these patients, not in the other subsets mentioned, comprised 5% of the total population. These patients at low risk of recurrence, who comprise one third of the entire node-negative population, are highly curable by local therapy alone and may be spared the risks and costs of routine adjuvant systemic therapy (AST). Patients with tumors larger than 2 cm (152 patients; 37% of the population) are at high risk of recurrence (26% with a DFR of 74% [95% CI, 64% to 84%]) and should routinely receive systemic adjuvant therapy. Patients with tumors up to 2 cm who are not in the low-risk groups fall in a gray area (recurrence, 15% to 21%; DFR, 79% to 85%). For these groups, combining second-generation prognostic factors such as DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction, or cathepsin D should give the physician additional information to aid in making decisions regarding adjuvant therapy.\r"

Seventy-six patients were eligible for the assessment of efficacy. The response rate for treatment with intrapleural doxorubicin plus LC9018 (38 patients) was 73.7%, which was significantly higher than the response rate of 39.5% for the control group treated with doxorubicin alone (38 patients) (P less than 0.01). The LC9018 group also showed a significantly greater improvement in performance status (PS) and symptoms (chest pain, chest discomfort, and anorexia) than the control group (P less than 0.05). A significant prolongation of survival was noticed in the LC9018 group (P less than 0.05). The main side effects of LC9018 were fever and transient hepatic dysfunction, but there were no serious adverse reactions. These results suggest that the intrapleural instillation of LC9018 can be recommended for the treatment of malignant pleural effusions.\r"

To evaluate the feasibility of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy, 25 consecutive previously untreated patients with potentially resectable locoregional gastric carcinoma received two preoperative and three postoperative courses of etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin (EFP). Ninety-eight courses (median, five courses; range, two to five courses) were administered. Six patients had major responses to EFP. Eighteen patients (72%) had curative resections, and three specimens (12%) contained only microscopic carcinoma. At a median follow-up of 25 months, the median survival of 25 patients was 15 months (range, 4 to 32+ months). Peritoneal carcinomatosis was the most common indication of failure. One patient died of postoperative complications, but there were no deaths due to chemotherapy. EFP-induced toxic reactions were moderate. Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy for locoregional gastric carcinoma is feasible, and additional studies to develop regimens that could result in 5% to 10% complete pathologic responses may be warranted.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective randomized multicentric trial, 61 patients from six hospitals with resectable pancreatic cancer were recruited between 1987 and 1989. All patients underwent a Whipple resection. Two weeks after surgery, the patients were randomized to be given either intravenous (IV) treatment with 370 mg (100 mg loading dose, 9 x 30 mg continuing within 10 days) of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 494/32 (Behringwerke AG, Marsburg, Germany) or no additional anti-cancer treatment. This murine immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody has been shown to strongly bind to human pancreatic cancer cells and to induce an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Both study groups were well matched with respect to age, sex, tumor staging, and grading. Six patients suffered from minor toxicity (vomiting and abdominal pain) after immunotherapy. Ten months after the end of the recruitment period, 65% and 53% of the patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively, had died. Of the living patients, 60% and 53% are alive with recurrent or progressive cancer disease. Median survival time was 428 days (range, 248 to 510 days) and 386 days (range, 296 to 509 days) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The authors concluded that repeated IV treatment with the antibody 494/32 is not helpful in resectable pancreatic cancer. This study provides the first controlled data on passive immunotherapy in solid cancer.\r"

Since 1987, the authors have treated 12 patients with PMGCT with high-dose carboplatin (1500 mg/m2 to 1800 mg/m2) and etoposide (1200 mg/m2 to 1350 mg/m2) (in two patients ifosfamide [10 g/m2] was added) with ABMR. Patients were either in second relapse or cisplatin refractory (progression within 4 weeks of last cisplatin dosing). They had received a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens (range, one to three), all had had prior cisplatin therapy, and most had failed ifosfamide-based therapy. Six patients were cisplatin refractory and of these only one achieved a partial response (PR) that was of short duration. It was planned that all patients would undergo two rounds of therapy; however, only 5 of 12 patients received two courses. The remainder had only one round of therapy either because of inadequate response (three patients) or excessive toxicity (four patients). There were four patients who died in the peritransplant period due to sepsis (two patients) or bleeding (two patients). The median survival of the group was 107 days (range, 14 days to 347 days). No patient achieved a complete remission, but there were six partial remissions, four with stable disease, and two with progressive disease. The use of high-dose carboplatin and etoposide with or without ifosfamide and ABMR was not effective in the treatment of this group of patients with PMGCT who were in second relapse or cisplatin refractory.\r"

All patients were treated with megavoltage photons to an abdominopelvic field to a median dose of 2500 cGy, with continued treatment to a whole pelvic field to a median dose of 4500 cGy. Three patients received additional boost to the vaginal apex. Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 31 months (median, 25 months) after completion of WART. Six patients had recurrent disease at 5 to 20 months (median, 7.5 months). Four of these patients died of their disease during the follow-up period. Three of six patients in whom treatment failed had disease at the vaginal apex. None of these patients received boost radiation therapy to that site. In contrast, two of three patients remaining disease free were treated with additional vaginal apex irradiation. Based on these results, the authors do not routinely recommend WART for adjuvant treatment of UPSC. They do, however, recommend vaginal apex irradiation for these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with advanced urologic cancers who were scheduled to receive at least two courses of chemotherapy were enrolled in this trial. Fifty thousand units of recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta analogue OCT-43 (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was administered subcutaneously only once or twice when severe neutropenia (less than 500/microliters) continued for 2 consecutive days. In eight patients, OCT-43 was not injected in the first course of chemotherapy as a control, but was injected in the second course. The durations of leukocytopenia (less than 2000/microliters) and neutropenia (less than 1000/microliters) were significantly shortened in the second course compared with those in the first course in those eight patients. Recovery of neutrophil number from the lowest number was also significantly faster in the second course. Thus, OCT-43 was considered to have hematopoietic activities. However, single or double injection of OCT-43 did not affect the numbers of eosinophilic or basophilic granulocytes, monocytes, or platelets. Adverse effects associated with OCT-43 injections were high fever and chills, but they were controlled by indomethacin.\r"

In eight cases, the lesion was treated by PEIT alone; in the other ten cases, PEIT was combined with transcatheter arterial embolization. The lesion was completely necrotic in 13 cases, 90% necrotic in four cases, and 70% necrotic in the rest. In addition, PEIT seemed to be effective against intercapsular, extracapsular, and vascular invasions. In the four cases of incomplete necrosis, the viable cancer tissue remained in small tumor nodules around the main tumor, in portions isolated by septa, or along the edge of the lesion. Therefore, ethanol should be injected not only into the center of the lesion, but also into sites close to its edge. Ethanol did not damage noncancerous liver parenchyma distant from injected sites. Local dissemination of the cancer cells was not found in any case. Therefore, PEIT seems to be a valuable therapy and may be an alternative to surgery in some cases.\r"

Expected changes from treatment, including regression of the extraosseous soft tissue mass, periostitis, and reconstitution of the cortex, occurred in all patients. Local recurrence occurred in one patient 10 years after complete remission whereas secondary osteosarcoma occurred more than 5 years after complete remission in two other cases. Both recurrent and secondary tumors presented as new lytic foci at the site of the original primary lesion. Lytic changes from radiation (radiation osteitis) may develop more than 2 years after treatment and in this sample; such findings were widely distributed in the radiation port. The authors conclude that bone remodeling and postradiation changes occur slowly over 2 years after treatment, and that any localized lysis at the primary site is suspicious for recurrence or secondary neoplasm. Knowledge of the expected changes and patterns of local recurrence and secondary neoplasms helps one to detect any significant change in its early phase.\r"

This complication occurred in three of 141 patients (2.1%) with metastatic cancer treated with high-dose IL-2 therapy; CI only developed in patients receiving interferon-alpha (IFN) with IL-2 (three of 21, 14%) compared with none of 120 in those patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.0009). Severe diarrhea (greater than or equal to 7 bowel movements/day) also was significantly more common in patients receiving IFN with IL-2 (six of 21, 29%) than in those receiving IL-2 alone (three of 120, 2.5%, P equals 0.001) and preceded the clinical diagnosis of CI in all three patients. Three of nine patients with severe diarrhea had CI. Hematochezia occurred in four patients, all of whom received IFN with IL-2; three had CI, and the other patient had nonspecific colitis. Differences in vasopressor use did not explain the increased risk of CI in patients receiving IFN; those receiving IFN with IL-2 required phenylephrine less often than patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.01). The administration of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells had no significant effect on the incidence of CI, severe diarrhea, peritonitis, or vasopressor use; two of three patients with CI, however, had their ischemic episode within 24 hours after the last of three LAK cell infusions. In conclusion, CI is an unusual complication of high-dose IL-2 and IFN immunotherapy. In patients receiving such combination therapy, severe diarrhea is a risk factor for the subsequent occurrence of CI.\r"

Histologically, malignant fibrous histiocytoma was the most common tumor type (11 cases), followed by angiosarcoma (four). The age at diagnosis of the sarcoma ranged from 15 to 74 years (mean, 58); the male-to-female ratio was 3.3:1. In the eight cases of sarcoma associated with chronic pleural inflammatory disease, male preponderance was more marked (7:1). The commonest presenting symptom was chest pain. A mass could be detected by chest roentgenograms in 13 patients and computed tomographic scans in 15 patients. No patient had distant metastases at first admission. Thirteen patients were treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Thirteen of the 17 patients died 1 to 87 months (mean, 14.2) after therapy for STS.

Histologically, 12 cases (42.9%) were osteoblastic osteosarcoma, ten (35.8%) were chondroblastic, four (14.3%) were fibroblastic, and two (7%) were round cell OS. Of the 28 cases, three (10.7%) were low grade, and 25 (89.3%) were high grade. Thirteen patients had intralesional surgery, and 13 had marginal surgery as their initial treatment.

In the patient in which the surgical margins were marginal, the lesion was small 2.5 X 2 cm. This patient was alive without evidence of disease after 9 years of follow-up.\r"

Although SPF correlated strongly both with WF and Kiel grades (P less than 0.0001), low-grade and high-grade malignant lymphomas according to Kiel classification, and high-grade lymphomas according to WF could be divided into groups with significantly different outcome by SPF.

Its localization was investigated immunohistochemically in the cervix, using normal tissue (27 samples) and squamous neoplastic tissue (three condylomas, 42 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] samples, 34 invasive squamous cell carcinoma samples). The expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was also studied in serial sections of the same subjects. Normal squamous cells and glandular cells of the cervix were negative for ADF. However, intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear ADF-positive cells were usually found in the intermediate and superficial layers of the neoplastic squamous epithelium of condylomas (three of three cases) and CIN (35/42 cases). HPV DNA was detected in all condylomas and in 27 of 42 CIN specimens. HPV DNA-positive cells were usually localized in the intermediate and superficial layers of the neoplastic squamous epithelium. These HPV DNA-positive cells were also positive for ADF. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma was also positive for ADF (24/34 cases) and HPV DNA (11/34 cases). The coexpression of HPV DNA and ADF was observed in all HPV DNA-positive cases. Coexistence of HPV DNA and ADF immunopositivity in neoplastic squamous cells of the cervix suggests that ADF expression closely reflects the intracellular event on HPV DNA replication.\r"

All 105 patients had premortem serum from which prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were obtained. Sixty-eight did not have carcinoma of the prostate (CAP), 28 had CAP less than 1 ml and 9 had CAP larger than 1 ml. Eleven untrimmed prostates weighed 80 g or more and eight had elevated PSA levels (more than 4.0 ng/ml): five of eight without CAP, two of two with CAP less than 1 ml, and one of one with CAP larger than 1 ml. Ninety-four whole untrimmed prostates weighed less than 80 g and 20 had elevated PSA levels: ten of 60 without CAP, two of 26 with CAP less than 1 ml, and eight of eight with CAP larger than 1 ml. This study suggests that PSA levels from patients with untrimmed prostates weighing 80 g or more (equivalent to a 60-g trimmed prostate) are usually elevated regardless whether CAP is present. However, CAP less than 1 ml, in untrimmed prostates less than 80 g, usually does not elevate PSA levels whereas CAP larger than 1 ml usually does (P less than 0.0001). The likelihood that elevated PSA levels, from patients with untrimmed prostates less than 80 g, are due to CAP larger than 1 ml increases as the PSA level increases.\r"

  ".W": "The authors reviewed 89 patients treated for cerebellar medulloblastoma between 1970 and 1989 to determine the impact of changing treatment (high-dose posterior fossa radiation therapy and chemotherapy) on the pattern of failure in medulloblastoma. Between 1970 and 1983, 50 patients (median follow-up, 110 months) were treated with surgery and postoperative craniospinal irradiation (CSI). Nineteen of the 50 (38%) recurred in the central nervous system (CNS). Isolated systemic (bone) metastases occurred in six. The median time to the development of bone metastases was 12 months. Since 1984, 39 patients (median follow-up, 27 months) were treated with preradiation chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and vincristine for 9 weeks before initiation of CSI. Nine of the 39 (23%) patients recurred in the CNS. There were no systemic failures in this cohort. The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 55 +/- 7% for the earlier cohort and 72 +/- 8% for the later cohort (P equals 0.3). Posterior fossa recurrence was associated with radiation therapy to this area. The cumulative incidence of posterior fossa relapse was 50 +/- 13% in patients who received less than 5300 cGy and 18 +/- 7% in those who received 5300 cGy or more (P equals 0.005). All six bone relapses were in patients treated with CSI alone and 5300 cGy or more to the posterior fossa for a 5-year cumulative incidence of bone metastases of 18 +/- 7% compared with 0% for patients treated with 5300 cGy or more and chemotherapy (P equals 0.03). The authors concluded that high-dose radiation therapy has altered the pattern of relapse with an increase in systemic recurrence after radiation therapy alone that is now equivalent to the risk of recurrence in the posterior fossa. Chemotherapy may be indicated in an attempt to decrease this high risk of systemic metastases.\r"

Pathologic examination of the pulmonary spread included electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry; these confirmed prolactin production by the tumor. The patient's presentation at initial diagnosis, disease recurrence, clinical course, management, and response to therapy (with its theoretic basis) are detailed. Despite the use of dopamine analogues (to tolerance and in combination), there was documented intracranial and extracranial disease progression.

In each case, two were stained by the Papanicolaou method and two underwent Feulgen hydrolysis. Quantitative assessment of nuclear area (NA) and cytoplasmic area (CA) of the Papanicolaou smears was undertaken using a semiautomatic image analysis system. DNA profiles were assessed from the Feulgen smears using a Vickers M85 microdensitometer (Vickers Instruments, York, England) and were found to be diploid for all patients. Results were then analyzed with respect to those patients who took alcohol, tobacco, combination of alcohol and tobacco, and those who took neither. A significant reduction in CA for the oral cancer group (P equals 0.001) but no change in NA (P equals 0.74) was observed. A detailed analysis of alcohol and tobacco habits could identify no significant role for these two factors, in the reduction in cytoplasmic area. Such field change may prove to be of value in predicting the development of second malignant tumors.\r"

Measured values were compared with the values predicted by the Harris-Benedict (HB) formula. Mean REE was 20% higher than predicted. Sixty percent of the patients (18 patients) had an elevated REE (greater than or equal to 115%) compared with this formula. The prevalence of hypermetabolism in a group of patients with gastric and colorectal cancer was only 13% (13 of 104 patients). When corrected for fat-free mass (FFM), REE was still significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in the lung cancer group compared with the gastric and colorectal cancer group. Whereas weight loss in healthy men leads to an adaptational decrease in energy expenditure (EE), weight loss in the patients with lung cancer was accompanied by an increase in REE. Tumor stage, tumor localization, pulmonary function, or smoking behavior could not explain the observed increase in REE in patients with lung cancer. Therefore, these metabolic alterations appear to be tumor mediated.\r"

Sigmoidoscopy revealed numerous polyps, several of which showed carcinomatous change. Dukes' Stage C colorectal carcinoma was diagnosed. Treatment consisted of total colectomy with construction of a Koch's pouch. He remained well for 3 years until onset of headache, nausea, and vomiting. Computed tomographic scan disclosed a large, circumscribed, enhancing, right frontoparietal mass. After craniotomy and partial resection, histologic review disclosed anaplastic astrocytoma. He received cranial radiation therapy, 6000 cGy, by parallel opposed ports to the tumor bed, and carmustine 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 8 weeks. Flow cytometric DNA analysis was done on the paraffin-embedded archival material from the patient's normal colon, colonic adenocarcinoma, and anaplastic astrocytoma.

In selected patients, conservative surgery followed by radiation therapy may be an alternative to radical surgery, with the goals of local control of the disease and anal sphincter preservation.

The Cox proportional-hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio, adjusting for other potentially prognostic factors. Both the disease-free interval and the overall survival were longer in patients who were obese (greater than or equal to 120% standard body mass index) at diagnosis. The adjusted-hazard ratio for disease recurrence between obese and nonobese patients was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.98). The obese patients had an adjusted death hazard rate 0.68 times that of the nonobese patients (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.22). Although obesity was reported to increase the risk for renal cell carcinoma, prognosis was no worse and may be better among obese patients with the disease.\r"

The focus was on the importance of endometrial carcinoma in the tumor spectrum. The diagnosis of cancer family was delayed in 14 of the 19 families because endometrial carcinoma was not included in the primary diagnostic carcinoma. This delay may have been harmful to 16 family members who had carcinomas later in life. In ten of the 14 women with multiple malignancies, endometrial adenocarcinoma was the primary malignancy diagnosed, thus enabling the suspicion of a gene carrier and screening for subsequent malignancies. The authors concluded that endometrial carcinoma is a significant component of cancer family syndrome and should be included in the main criteria of Lynch syndrome II.\r"

There was significant correlation between assessments done at different times by different physicians (QL index rs, 0.786; P less than 0.001; LASA rs, 0.865; P less than 0.001). The correlation coefficient of the QL index and the LASA score with the patient's dysphagia grade was 0.459 and 0.336, respectively. The patient's swallowing ability, QL index, and LASA all were improved significantly at some time after laser therapy. The mean survival was 16 weeks with 58% of patients dying at home, 28% in the hospital, and 18% in a hospice. It was concluded that laser photoablation improves the overall quality of life in patients with malignant dysphagia.\r"

At least 50% of the difference in mortality is believed to be due to delay in diagnosis, although risk-promoting lifestyles and behaviors also contribute to decreased survival. A potential exacerbating factor among the poor is inadequate information and knowledge about cancer and its treatment. Interviews were conducted with 128 cancer patients from a socioeconomically disadvantaged population to assess knowledge of cancer and its treatment and to evaluate care-seeking behaviors. Results indicated that although patients relied primarily on their physicians for information about their disease and treatment, a number of misconceptions regarding cancer existed in this population. Notably, nearly 50% of the patients surveyed either denied or did not know that smoking was related to the development of cancer. Additionally, patients frequently reported inappropriate care-seeking behaviors when asked to respond to a series of common disease-related signs or symptoms. These findings suggest that misinformation and misconceptions regarding cancer and its treatment among patients in this sample may contribute to inappropriate care-seeking behaviors.\r"

A total of 4713 patients participated. All the patients were patch tested with nickel sulphate, formaldehyde, paraben-mix, and MCI/MI. 19.4% of the patients had positive patch tests to nickel, making this the most common allergen. 3% of the patients reacted to 100 ppm MCI/MI, while 2.6% reacted to formaldehyde and 1.1% to parabens. There was great variation in the frequency of MCI/MI sensitivity among the 22 centres. MCI/MI contact allergy was most common among women and in patients with facial dermatitis, while it was rarely seen in patients with dermatitis on the lower legs. There were no fluctuations in the number of positive patch tests to MCI/MI on a monthly basis when the results from all centres were combined. 117 of the 141 MCI/MI sensitized patients included in the study were retested. 88% had positive patch tests when retested. 101 of the MCI/MI-sensitive patients participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled product use test. This test showed that 31% of the MCI/MI-sensitive patients had a positive reaction to a MCI/MI-preserved product. Only a few patients reacted to a control product.

The skin temperature, TEWL and electrical capacitance were measured on the fingers, hands and forearms. A linear positive relation was found between the temperature and TEWL (in all measured areas), a linear negative relation between the temperature and capacitance (fingers and palms), and a linear negative relation between the capacitance and TEWL (fingers). The results on the fingers among workers in the fish processing industry were compared with results among metal workers (n = 52), cleaners (n = 30), gut cleaners (n = 25), nurses (n = 16), office workers with indoor climate syndrome (n = 20) and normal controls (n = 29). A linear positive relation was found between the respective temperature-TEWL values and a linear negative relation between the respective temperature-capacitance values in the various groups. Furthermore the slope of the temperature-TEWL relations was identical in all groups. Therefore, differences in TEWL levels (comparison at the same temperature) between the respective groups and controls and between the various groups might indicate damage to the skin barrier caused by contact with different irritants and chemicals. However, differences in environment-related variables in the various occupations might also affect TEWL levels. This field study demonstrates, from a practical point of view, how the skin temperature affects TEWL in the various occupations and, as a new point, how sensitive capacitance is to changes in skin temperature. Seasonal variation in TEWL and capacitance was demonstrated among workers in the fish processing industry, with a low TEWL and a high capacitance during summer when the workload is lower.\r"

Applications of captafol (18.7 or 37.4 mg/ml), dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB; 5 mg/ml) or solvent (4:1 acetone:ethanol mixture) were administered to the shaved abdomen on 2 consecutive days, or on days 1, 2, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Following challenge with captafol (37.4 mg/ml) or DNFB (2 mg/ml) on the right ear 6 days after the last induction, ear thickness ratios (right ear/left ear) were significantly larger after challenge in captafol-induced and DNFB-induced mice compared to control mice. A slightly larger response was observed with the smaller induction dose level of captafol and with multiple inductions over the course of a month. The overall maximum response to captafol was not increased by pretreatment with cyclophosphamide. Histologically, ears from captafol-induced and DNFB-induced mice showed edema and cellular infiltration. This study demonstrated the ability of captafol to produce contact hypersensitivity in the BALB/c mouse.\r"

A water solution of D-sorbitol (S) and indocyanine green (ICG) was infused intravenously in six controls and nine cirrhotics. Steady-state renal and hepatic S clearances as well as hepatic ICG clearance were calculated. In controls the values (mean +/- SD) of the independent measurements of S and ICG hepatic clearance were 978 +/- 107 and 519 +/- 142 ml/min, respectively, while in cirrhotic patients they were 554 +/- 238 and 231 +/- 90 ml/min. Owing to the kinetic properties of S, its hepatic clearance may be regarded as a measure of functional liver plasma flow (FLPF). The total liver plasma flow (TLPF) values (mean +/- SD), calculated according to Fick's principle, were 1091 +/- 157 ml/min (S method) and 1033 +/- 153 ml/min (ICG method) in controls, and 1251 +/- 554 and 1284 +/- 677 ml/min in cirrhotics. In controls, FLPF was found to be very close to TLPF. In cirrhotic patients the difference between TLPF and FLPF (ranging from 169 to 2093 ml/min when measured by S method) was considered as an approximate estimate of intrahepatic shunting. The procedure is safe and simple and may add a new dimension to the investigation of hepatic circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-eight patients with cirrhosis were prospectively followed for up to 20 months, on the average. At entry into the study, galactose elimination capacity, aminopyrine breath test, and ICG clearance were measured. At the end of the study, 27 patients had died. Univariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method showed that both quantitative liver function tests (galactose elimination capacity: P less than 0.025; aminopyrine breath test: P less than 0.001; ICG clearance: P less than 0.005) and common clinical and biochemical data (encephalopathy: P less than 0.001; ascites: P less than 0.001; serum bilirubin: P less than 0.005; serum albumin: P less than 0.001; prothrombin index: P less than 0.05) were significant predictors of survival. To investigate whether quantitative liver function tests could contribute to a better definition of the prognosis, once Pugh score had already been taken into account, a multiple regression analysis according to the Cox model was performed. Pugh score and galactose elimination capacity resulted in the only independent prognostic covariates. From them a prognostic index was calculated, and the model was validated in an additional sample of 70 patients investigated according to the same protocol. The contribution GEC gave to the assessment of overall prognosis over that obtained using the Pugh score was slight, as estimated by the statistical parameters of the Cox's model, but was significant as assessed by a ROC curve analysis (P = 0.05). These data show that all quantitative liver function tests were predictors of survival in cirrhosis, and that the galactose elimination capacity added some new prognostic information to those already available using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification.\r"

Following a two-week washout period, these were crossed over to the alternate treatment. Conn's index, which comprises the evaluation of the mental state, asterixis, number connection test, EEG record, and plasma ammonia, was used to score the degree of hepatic encephalopathy, both at the beginning and end of each treatment period. Serum zinc was significantly raised after oral zinc administration and reached the levels observed in cirrhotics without hepatic encephalopathy. Despite this, however, no modification in the parameters included in Conn's index were observed. In conclusion, this study failed to confirm that short-term oral zinc supplementation improves chronic hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

From July 1975 through August 1978, a 38-month period, 18 medical centers in the United States and one in Canada participated in this trial. A total of 64 patients were accessed and found eligible to participate in the study; two of them were subsequently eliminated from our analysis. Eighteen patients received placebo; 23 received 400 mg hydrocortisone per day, and 21 patients were administered 800 mg hydrocortisone per day. We did not observe any therapeutic effect of hydrocortisone, and the survival rates for placebo versus 400 mg and versus 800 mg hydrocortisone per day were 22%, 9%, and 24%, respectively. Fulminant hepatitis associated with drug hepatotoxicity or non-A, non-B hepatitis seemed to have a worse prognosis than fulminant B, although these differences were not significant. Serum alpha-fetoprotein had a modest prognostic value of survival and seemed to be limited to fulminant B. The AHFSG recommends, therefore, that corticosteroid use in acute hepatic failure with hepatic encephalopathy be discontinued.\r"

The overall incidence of postbiopsy hematoma formation was 18.3%, with approximately the same results occurring in blind biopsy patients (20%) and laparoscopy-guided biopsy patients (17%). Only two patients had significant pain associated with the hematoma formation (one from each group), one of whom had evidence of intraperitoneal bleed and rebleed. Our results suggest that postbiopsy asymptomatic hematomas occur more frequently than had been generally thought and that laparoscopy-guided biopsy is not safer than blind biopsy.\r"

Both pathological changes were evenly distributed in four cases. The remaining 15 cases showed nonspecific or other histological changes. Electron microscopy revealed that HBV core and Dane particles were seen with Mallory bodies in the same hepatocytes. Thus, we postulate that HBV-related changes are more often encountered than alcoholic ones in alcoholic HBV carriers and that HBV replication can occur even in hepatocytes bearing Mallory bodies.\r"

  ".U": "91372048\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that humoral factors, namely glucagon, can account for approximately 30% of the splanchnic vasodilation in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. A reduced vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II may contribute to the splanchnic vasodilation. However, neither glucagon nor an altered vasoconstrictor sensitivity can fully account for the splanchnic vasodilation observed in portal hypertensive subjects. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the role of bile acids in the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension since (1) serum bile acids are elevated in portal hypertensive subjects and (2) bile acids are potent intestinal vasodilators. Prehepatic portal hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by surgical constriction of the portal vein. Ten to 14 days after the induction of portal hypertension, the enterohepatic circulation of control and portal hypertensive rats was surgically interrupted. The animals were placed in Bollman restraint cages and allowed to recover. Eighteen to 24 hr later, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and regional blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Normal and portal hypertensive animals without bile fistula served as controls. Plasma bile acid levels measured by radioimmunoassay were approximately 3.8 times higher in portal hypertensive animals than in control. Bile duct cannulation effectively depleted both normal and portal hypertensive animals of their circulating bile acid pool and significantly reduced portal venous inflow in portal hypertensive but not in control rats. A role for bile acids as partial mediators of the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension is suggested since bile acid depletion did not completely abolish the gastrointestinal hyperemia.\r"

A latex balloon was placed in the proximal stomach and inflated by increments of 100 ml of air up to a maximal volume of 800 ml. Symptom response and intragastric pressure-volume curve were recorded during the gradual balloon distension. Thirteen of the 24 patients experienced pain at a distension volume less than or equal to 400 ml of air, but only one of the 20 controls (P less than 0.001). Intragastric pressure-volume curves were similar in patients and controls, and in patients with and without abnormal pain threshold, suggesting that a compliance defect was not the cause of the sensory anomaly. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was measured in 20 of the 24 patients using a dual isotopic technique; psychological status was also evaluated in 18 patients using the Mini-Mult test. The frequency of the sensory anomaly was not different in patients with (7/14) or without (4/6) gastric stasis, but was lower in patients with (5/13) than in those without psychological disturbances (5/5, P less than 0.01). Thus, a primary visceral sensory anomaly, either alone or in conjunction with motility disturbances, can play an important role in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and must be taken in account for further therapeutic research.\r"

Patients and controls fasted for at least 6 hr were given 0.5 mCI of [99mTc] diethylene triaminopentaacetic acid orally in 150 cc milk with 50 g cornflakes. A time-activity curve was obtained and radioactivity over the stomach was recorded exponentially. The parameter of the T1/2 emptying time was used. In normal controls T1/2 emptying time ranged from 18 to 26 min. Twenty-five symptomatic patients were examined, three of whom achieved normal values, but 22 patients showed pathologic results ranging from 36 to 184 min. In patients with chronic nausea and/or vomiting an isotopic examination of the stomach may provide a simple and rapid diagnostic method of evaluation.\r"

Twelve healthy males received, under double-blind conditions, 30 mg cisapride rectally or placebo, and 3 hr thereafter a semisolid meal of low (9.2 g) or high (37.9 g) fat content. The sequence of combinations placebo/low-fat meal, placebo/high-fat meal, and cisapride/high-fat meal was randomized. Gastric emptying and antral motility were recorded scintigraphically. After placebo/high-fat, emptying was significantly slower (P less than 0.05) than after placebo/low-fat. After cisapride/high-fat, emptying was significantly faster (P less than 0.01) than after placebo/high-fat and similar to that after placebo/low-fat. Antral motility was little affected. The slow emptying of a high-fat meal thus seems a suitable model for the evaluation of prokinetic drug effects.\r"

The IgA response to H. pylori in patients with duodenitis was restricted to the first part of the duodenum; second part duodenal biopsies secreting significantly (P less than 0.001) less IgA during culture in vitro. H. pylori IgG antibody secretion by cultured biopsies was also significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in patients with duodenitis and those with gastric H. pylori infection but without duodenitis. Immunoblotting of duodenal bulb culture supernatants showed positive recognition by the mucosal IgA response of H. pylori antigens in the region of 120, 90, 61, and 31-26 kDa in patients with duodenitis. Serologically, such patients showed little evidence of IgA H. pylori antibodies by immunoblotting. These results demonstrate that the inflammatory response in the duodenal mucosa of patients with duodenitis represents a specific highly localized humoral response to H. pylori.\r"

We studied the effects of verapamil and diltiazem on solid-phase gastric emptying in 10 healthy volunteers. Each subject underwent a radionuclide gastric emptying determination (1) without preadministered medication, (2) after verapamil 80 mg orally every 6 hr for 10 doses, and (3) after diltiazem 60 mg by mouth given as one dose. Results revealed no significant difference in gastric emptying rates after pretreatment with verapamil or diltiazem when compared with no premedication (P greater than 0.37). We conclude that verapamil and diltiazem do not significantly delay gastric emptying in normal subjects. These data may be of clinical significance when prescribing calcium-channel blockers to patients with diseases associated with altered gastric emptying.\r"

It was proven in animals 100 years ago but could not be demonstrated in man until liver biopsy and modern hepatic tests became available. Structural changes in the regenerating liver mainly concern the arrangement of liver cell plates and the size and appearance of hepatocytic nuclei. A return to normalcy in test results depends on the factors responsible for regeneration since various test results change at different rates. Mass, estimated by imaging procedures, is restored parallel with the return of function. Shape is not restored but the pressure of neighboring organs and structures molds the growing remnant so that it almost resembles the original. Factors regulating regeneration in man are beginning to be recognized as they have been in animals. The hope is that regeneration can be accelerated or that cells can be transplanted to replace those lost.\r"

This process had remained an intriguing mystery over the millennia. In the last 20 years, following the pioneering work of Bucher (1) and Moolten et al (2), there has been an explosion of research that has clarified some of the mechanisms underlying the process of hepatic regeneration. Regeneration implies proliferation and regeneration. After the fetal and postnatal growth of the liver is completed, hepatocytes no longer proliferate actively, but they can proliferate in response to cell death or loss (3). Hepatocyte growth responses are of particular research interest because they occur in vivo and involve cells that are normally quiescent. Hepatic regeneration constitutes a highly regulated process that is best shown by the arrest of liver growth following a partial hepatectomy precisely at the moment the hepatic mass reaches the mass of the original intact liver (3). This suggests that hepatic regeneration after a partial hepatectomy is a strictly regulated nonautonomous growth process that is controlled by the same factors that are responsible for the determination and maintenance of hepatic mass in a normal individual. In response to a partial hepatectomy, hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and progress to DNA synthesis and replication but only in numbers sufficient to restore the hepatic mass. The regeneration response is both synchronized and universal in that it affects all intrahepatic cell lines, including nonparenchymal cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study investigates the possible role of mitoinhibitory effects of OA as being responsible for its promotional effects. Male Fischer 344 rats were given a semisynthetic basal diet (BD) or a diet containing 1% OA for four weeks coupled with 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH), and all animals were then continued on BD for an additional four weeks. This protocol is known to exert a promoting effect on the initiated rat liver. Livers were perfused, and the labeling index (LI) of isolated cultured hepatocytes was monitored. Hepatocytes isolated from livers of rats fed a BD or 1% OA exhibited in vitro an LI of 39 +/- 2 and 24 +/- 1%, respectively. The lowered in vitro LI was seen even upon exposure to epidermal growth factor (EGF) (67 +/- 2% in OA-treated livers compared to 91 +/- 2% in hepatocytes from control rat liver). A similar four-week exposure to OA coupled with PH decreased hepatic DNA synthesis induced by a choline-deficient diet in vivo by about 50%. These results indicate that OA is able to decrease the response of normal hepatocytes to growth factors and suggest a possible mechanism of chronic differential mitoinhibition as a basis for promotion induced by OA.\r"

The worldwide predominance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in males has led to the suggestion that this disease might be hormone-responsive. Therefore, the hepatic estrogen (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) status of liver specimens from such patients was investigated. Samples were obtained from three female and six males patients undergoing liver resection; in each case, a small sample of both the tumor and adjacent normal tissue was collected. All patients had primary hepatocellular carcinoma without cirrhosis. In most cases, the tumor and the normal specimen had an equivalent content of cytosolic ER; however, three of the tumor samples (one female and two male) displayed considerably elevated cytosolic ER levels as compared to that of the normal tissue. In every sample, the tumor contained less nuclear ER than did the normal liver. When AR was measured, tumors of three patients (one female and two male) demonstrated a twofold elevation in cytosolic AR as compared to adjacent normal tissue. In the two male patients, an approximately twofold greater nuclear AR was found. Two other samples from male patients showed a modest elevation of cytosolic AR in the tumors. The patients whose tumors showed elevations in ER were not the same patients as those in whom the AR was elevated. Thus, these studies indicate that certain, but not all, specimens of HCC demonstrate either elevated ER or AR and suggest that a determination of receptor content might be useful prior to initiation of certain antihormone therapies.\r"

Here, we examine whether hepatocyte proliferation, stimulated by partial hepatectomy, is associated with altered serum prolactin or protein kinase C activation. Within 5-15 min of liver resection, serum prolactin concentrations elevate significantly. Protein kinase C activity in hepatic cytosol decreases significantly, and membrane and nuclear PKC activity increase by 30 min. Hypophysectomy prior to partial hepatectomy abrogates any effect of liver resection on protein kinase C activation in the hepatic remnant. Based upon these data, it is suggested that the rapid increase in serum prolactin seen after partial hepatectomy may be linked to protein kinase C activation, which in turn stimulates the hepatic proliferative response that is essential for hepatic regeneration.\r"

Most of the patients waiting for liver transplantation have chronic liver insufficiency but are not in hepatic coma. Various hepatic assist systems have been used to salvage patients with acute liver insufficiency. Most attempts have been disappointing. The methods used have included plasma exchange, plasma adsorption, double filtration, cryofiltration, thermofiltration, the combination of plasma exchange and amino acid hemodialysis, and others. For patients with chronic liver disease with moderate liver function impairment and limited to one or only a few areas of metabolic abnormality, a hepatic assist might allow the life of the patient to be maintained temporarily. The application of hepatic assist methods for chronic liver disease patients treated at the Cleveland Clinic has been encouraging. One of the patients who suffered from sclerosing cholangitis has maintained a near-normal life for almost five years by 170 plasma treatments. This is in spite of the fact that, at the onset of treatment, the patient was nearly comatose. Unfortunately, this patient did not wish to receive a liver transplantation. Based upon this experience, the concept of a bridge to transplantation approach to hepatic assist devices appears feasible. In addition, it is speculated that hepatic assistance during the early recovery stage of liver transplantation and during mild episodes of rejection may be useful.\r"

  ".U": "91372074\r", 
  ".W": "Once regarded as medical curiosities, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have achieved a remarkable change in status recently and today are among the more compelling of all human illnesses. The cause(s) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not known. Genetic, environmental, microbial, and immunologic factors are involved, but the precise mechanisms are obscure. The incidence of ulcerative colitis is relatively stable, while Crohn's disease continues to increase in frequency. In 10% to 15% of patients, it is hard to differentiate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis; however, problems with diagnosis usually resolve with time and repeated examinations. In part I of his two-part monograph on IBD, Dr. Kirsner addresses the nature and pathogenesis of the disease. Increased study of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in recent years has generated new knowledge regarding their etiology. Part I focuses on microbial, immunologic, and genetic mechanisms and the inflammatory processes involved in the disease. In part II, which will be presented in next month's issue of Disease-a-Month, Dr. Kirsner deals with the clinical features, course, and management of IBD, based on the author's 55 years of experience with these problems and supplemented by critical examination of the recent (1988-1990) literature. Particular attention is directed to the symptoms and physical findings of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the laboratory, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic features, and the many systemic complications. The IBDs are mimicked by several enterocolonic infections and other conditions, making differential diagnosis necessary. Inflammatory bowel disease in children and the elderly conforms to conventional clinical patterns modified by the health circumstances of the respective age groups. Because the cause of IBD has not been established, current medical therapy is facilitative and supportive rather than curative. The principles of medical treatment are approximately the same for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Treatment emphasizes a program rather than a drug and also considers the individuality of the therapeutic response. A clearer understanding of dietary and nutritional needs, including hyperalimentation and electrolyte and fluid balance, aids treatment. Antidiarrheal and antispasmodic preparations and sedatives are prescribed for symptom relief. The bowel inflammation is controlled with sulfasalazine or the newer 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, antibacterial drugs for complications of Crohn's disease and IBD, adrenocortical steroids, and the immunosuppressive compounds 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as determined in each patient. The surgical procedures available for treatment of ulcerative colitis include total proctocolectomy and ileostomy or ileoanal anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The infant or child who presents to the Emergency Department with bacterial meningitis may have nonspecific vague symptoms with few signs of serious illness. However, the disease is often rapidly progressive and life-threatening, and may be associated with respiratory failure, circulatory failure, increased intracranial pressure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or convulsions, any of which may lead to a fatal outcome. It is important for the triage technician in an Emergency Department to cautiously inspect each young patient who presents with illness, carefully considering whether the presenting syndrome of symptoms and signs might be consistent with early meningitis. If the young patient is triaged in a nonemergent category, then periodic assessments of the patients waiting to be seen may ensure that, when the infant or child with an obscure presentation develops evidence suggesting this diagnosis, the triage technician will promptly notify the appropriate definitive care providers who assume responsibility for immediate definitive evaluation and stabilization. Changes in delivery of lifesaving care to the life-threatened child are being impacted by current advances in the understanding of the biochemical basis of disease at the cellular and subcellular levels. Endotoxin release into the blood causes increased production of kinins, which results in vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability. Members of the leukotriene family may also enhance vascular permeability as well as produce augmented leukocyte aggregation to vascular endothelium, vasoconstriction, and bronchoconstriction. Endotoxin activates the complement cascade and induces platelets to form reversible aggregates that may be trapped in the pulmonary microcirculation; and endotoxemia-activated platelets release serotonin, which may be associated with pulmonary hypertension. Now that we have antibiotics that are effective against organisms whose degradation produces endotoxin, there is interest in lessening the host inflammatory response to endotoxin through use of dexamethasone as an anti-inflammatory agent. Clinical trials have revealed that patients who received dexamethasone became afebrile earlier and were less likely to acquire deafness after bacterial meningitis. Because administration of antibiotics is the current specific medical therapy for this life-threatening microbial invasion, it is reasonable to continue to strive to shorten the interval between recognition of disease and specific therapy. However, new studies suggest that consequences of the complex host inflammatory response (at the cellular and subcellular level) to microbial invasion and endotoxin release from bacterial degradation are increasingly important in determining survival or severity of morbidity. Therapeutic intervention with specific antibiotics and steroid anti-inflammatory agents for modulating host responses enhances outcome.\r"

Many of these illnesses are not usually found in the United States. Late diagnosis of certain illnesses, such as falciparum malaria, may increase the morbidity and mortality. As such, travel history should become a routine part of patient evaluation, and the physician should have a good working knowledge of illnesses that may be acquired abroad.\r"

The majority of tick-borne diseases are nonspecific in their initial clinical and laboratory presentation and may be confused with a variety of more common illnesses. A history of tick exposure is frequently not available. Although specific serologic tests exist for confirming the diagnosis of many of these diseases, the time required for confirmation of results makes them of little use in the acute situation. Recognition of the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens and clinical suspicion are of key importance in making the appropriate diagnosis. Early and specific therapy is a principal factor in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases.\r"

Although it is overwhelmingly a benign, self-limited illness requiring only supportive care, serious complications can occur and the disease may be life-threatening on occasion. Although randomized clinical trials of antibiotic therapy for CSD do not exist, CSD has demonstrated in vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics, and gentamicin has been reported beneficial in a few patients with systemic manifestations of the illness. Therefore, pending clinical trials, gentamicin may be worthy of consideration in CSD patients with serious manifestations of this illness. CSD is one of the most common causes of adenopathy and should be considered in all patients who present with unilateral or regional lymphadenopathy.\r"

RU486 may also be of potential value in the medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Its use as a postcoital contraception is suggested, but further research is required to determine whether RU486 can be used on a once-a-month basis for contraception.\r"

Though a few early studies demonstrated an increased risk of Down syndrome with advanced paternal age, especially after the age of 55, numerous later studies failed to confirm any paternal age effect. Among structural chromosome anomalies, only the inherited reciprocal translocations were found to be more common among children of older fathers. Chromosome analysis of semen donors would rule out this problem. There is evidence, however, that the incidence of serious nonchromosomal birth defects, especially those arising from new autosomal mutations, increases with paternal age. Risk estimates have been established for increased paternal age and contribution to new dominant mutations. The established association between increased paternal age and new autosomal mutations and the fact that most of the disorders associated with such mutations cannot be prenatally diagnosed may be important in establishing the upper age limit for semen donors. Recommendations from the literature are interpreted to advise men to have their children before age 40. This suggestion would obviously benefit immediate offspring and perhaps successive generations as well. The limit of 35 years set by AATB standards, therefore, is in harmony with such benefit, but may be too stringent in eliminating potential donors. Accordingly, the Reproductive Council of the AATB has initiated steps to modify its standards to the age limit of 40.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hormonal changes during RU486 were compared with control data obtained in the preceding cycle during the early follicular phase. Clinical responses were determined by patient assessment and second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: All women became amenorrheic, and daily urinary levels of ovarian steroid metabolites remained acyclic. Mean luteinizing hormone (LH) (P less than 0.02) and LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.05) were increased without changes in LH pulse frequency. An antiglucocorticoid effect was demonstrated by an increase in serum cortisol (P less than 0.01) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (P less than 0.05) levels. Treatment resulted in an improvement in pelvic pain in all subjects without significant change in the extent of disease as evaluated by follow-up laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Daily administration of RU486 results in acyclic ovarian function and improvement in the subjective painful symptoms of endometriosis.\r"

RESULTS: The volume and total cell count were positively correlated, whereas the total cell count was negatively correlated with the extent of endometriosis. Despite a similar negative trend, no statistically significant correlation was noted between the volume and the extent of endometriosis. These relationships did not change when the data were reanalyzed deleting those pathological features contributing to the endometriosis score but not capable of producing intraperitoneal menstrual debris, i.e., adhesions and encapsulated ovarian endometriomas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that menstrual debris from ectopic endometrium is probably not a major factor in the elicitation of the observed PF inflammation in infertile women with endometriosis and suggest an inverse relationship may exist between PF inflammation and the extent of endometriosis.\r"

DESIGN: The late estradiol (E2) concentration in 48 viable pregnancies and 39 pregnancies which resulted in spontaneous abortions after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer were used to evaluate such predictability.

RESULTS: The late luteal CL activity after rescue had a positive correlation with the number and quality of the implanted embryos. Reduced CL activity was indicative of abortion. The late luteal E2 pattern when compared with hCG doubling time had a better abortion predictability (37.8% versus 63.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Corpus luteum activity demonstrated to be a better prognosticator of abortion than serial beta-hCG titers.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Alterations in adrenocortical biosynthesis, as measured by the steroid response to acute adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation, have frequently been reported in female hyperandrogenism. These patients are also commonly obese, which may account for some of these abnormalities. The object of this study was to test the hypothesis that obesity alters the adrenal response to acute adrenal stimulation. DESIGN: A prospective study of healthy premenopausal women of varying weights. SETTING: University-based clinical research center. PATIENTS: Fifty-seven healthy, eumenorrheic, nonhirsute female volunteers were studied, 30 weighing between 90% and 110% (normal-weight) and 27 weighing greater than 120% (obese) their ideal body weight. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects underwent a 60-minute acute intravenous ACTH-(1-24) stimulation test in the follicular phase (days 3 to 8) of the menstrual cycle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The basal levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), total and free testosterone (T), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estrone, estradiol, prolactin, and the luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormone ratio were measured. Basal and poststimulation levels of androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17 alpha-OHP), 17-hydroxypregnenolone (17-PREG), 11-deoxycortisol (S), and cortisol (F) were also obtained, and the net increments after stimulation were calculated. RESULTS: Normal-weight and obese women did not differ in age, height, or waist-hip ratio. Obese volunteers demonstrated lower circulating SHBG, 17-PREG, and S levels, and S/F ratio, but a higher free T and DHEAS/DHEA levels. No other differences were observed in either basal or adrenal response measures, with the exception of the net increment in A, which was almost twofold higher in obese volunteers (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in eumenorrheic nonhirsute women is associated with lower circulating SHBG activity and higher free T and DHEAS/DHEA levels. No significant difference in adrenocortical response to acute ACTH-(1-24) stimulation was observed between obese and normal-weight women, with the exception of a higher net adrenal output of A. It does not appear that the abnormal adrenal stimulation results frequently observed in hyperandrogenic women are a consequence of their obesity.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist Nal-Glu administration in the luteal phase and the potential rescue by exogenous human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) of corpus luteum (CL) after antagonist treatment. DESIGN: We studied the dose of Nal-Glu required for luteolysis and subsequently we coadministered low doses of hCG for 3 consecutive days either simultaneously to Nal-Glu administration (n = 5), or 48 (n = 5), or 72 hours (n = 5) later. Six additional participants received pharmacological doses of hCG 48 hours after the luteolytic dose of Nal-Glu. SETTING: Participants were studied in Clinique Endocrinologique, Nantes, and in Service d'Endocrinologie, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine normal young women (ages 20 to 35) were studied. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Measurements of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, Progesterone (P) levels were performed by radioimmunoassay before, during, and after the various treatment regimens. RESULTS: Complete luteolysis occurred in women who received 10 mg of Nal-Glu daily on days 4 and 5 after the LH surge. The coadministration of Nal-Glu and hCG overrode the effect of the antagonist (P = 48.8 +/- 22.5 versus 60.8 +/- 3.1 nmol/L in controls treated with hCG alone [NS]). When hCG treatment was started 48 hours after Nal-Glu, a partial luteolysis occurred (P = 33.8 +/- 10.9 versus 117 +/- 12.9 nmol/L, P less than 0.01). When hCG was started 72 hours after Nal-Glu, a complete luteolysis occurred (P = 5.8 +/- 2.05 versus 36.2 +/- 0.6 nmol/L, P less than 0.01). Higher doses of hCG (1,500 or 5,000 IU) administered 72 hours after Nal-Glu resulted in a significant rescue of CL function (P = 37.7 +/- 4.8 and P = 43.8 +/- 22.2 versus 74.5 +/- 19.8 and 130.2 +/- 14.3 nmol/L, P less than 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the LH dependence of CL function. The suppression of CL LH support for 72 hours induced a compromise of the CL nonreversible by low doses of hCG mimicking early pregnancy but reversible with pharmacological doses.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative. SETTING: At the University Hospital of Clermont Ferrand and the La Pergola Clinic at Vichy from July 1974 to December 1987. PATIENTS: This study was carried out in 223 patients who had been treated laparoscopically for EP and who desired future childbearing and who were not lost to follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The measures chosen to achieve the objective included age, parity, size of hematosalpinx, volume of hemoperitoneum, tubal rupture, location, intrauterine device, ipsilateral and contralateral adhesions, and patient's previous history of salpingitis, EP, solitary tube, and tubal infertility. RESULTS: The general intrauterine pregnancy rate was 67% (149 patients) and the recurrence rate 12% (27 patients). The results according to the studied factors demonstrated that age, parity, and the type of the EP have no influence on the postectopic fertility. The history of the patient, ipsilateral adhesions, or contralateral tubal status significantly reduce the future fertility prognosis and risk of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: From a multivariable analysis, the authors propose a scoring system to choose the most suitable treatment to preserve fertility and to reduce the risk of recurrence ranging from laparoscopic conservative treatment to laparoscopic salpingectomy with contralateral sterilization.\r"

DESIGN: Serum hormone levels were measured at five times throughout the cycle in a sample of eight mothers of DZ twins and paired controls. On day 12, ovarian ultrasonography was performed. SETTING: Blood samples were collected in participants' homes except on day 12 when they were collected at the ultrasonography clinic. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Human volunteers who had at least one set of spontaneous DZ twins were paired with controls matched for age and parity. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol (E2) levels on approximate cycle days 1,2,8,12, and 21. RESULTS: Serum inhibin levels were elevated throughout the cycle (significantly on day 1) in mothers of DZ twins. Also elevated were early follicular FSH levels, LH levels throughout the follicular phase (significantly on days 1,2, and 8), and early to midfollicular E2 (significantly on day 8) in DZ mothers, indicative overall of greater follicular activity. CONCLUSION: It is concluded (1) that the primary cause of multiple ovulation in humans is not a decrease in inhibin secretion from the ovary; (2) the increased secretion of FSH and LH may be caused by elevated secretion of, or sensitivity to gonadotropin-releasing hormone; and (3) the elevated inhibin and E2 levels are a response to increased gonadotropin release.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if luteinizing human granulosa cells contain messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNAs) encoding insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBPs) and if cultured granulosa secrete IGFBPs into conditioned medium (CM). DESIGN: Northern analysis, using IGFBP-specific complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probes, was used to detect granulosa-derived IGFBP mRNAs. Western ligand blot analysis of CM was used to detect IGFBPs secreted by granulosa cultures with and without human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). SETTING: Granulosa cells were obtained from the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Program at Stanford University, a private teaching institution. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing IVF for tubal disease. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Transcripts of IGFBP mRNA and IGFBPs secreted into CM were detected by autoradiography of Northern and Western ligand blots, respectively. RESULTS: Transcripts of IGFBP-3, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-1 mRNA were detected in human luteinizing granulosa. Cultured granulosa secreted IGFBPs with molecular weights corresponding to IGFBP-3, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-1, and the latter two IGFBPs increased with 10 ng/mL hCG. A 24 kd IGFBP was noted, which may be newly characterized IGFBP-4. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that luteinizing human granulosa cells express mRNAs encoding three IGFBPs, secrete IGFBPs into culture medium, and that production of at least two of the IGFBPs is hCG-dependent, further supporting a role for the IGF system in human folliculogenesis.\r"

SETTING: Hormonally replaced ovarian failure patients undergoing an egg donation program in an academic research environment. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Nine human volunteers desiring egg donation. INTERVENTIONS: Replacement of E2 and P. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum E2 and P concentrations were measured weekly throughout the patients' gestations. RESULTS: Serum E2 and P levels of these patients remained low in early gestation but significantly increased 25 +/- 1.6 and 34 +/- 1.6 days post embryo transfer, respectively. Regression lines of E2 (r = 0.99; P less than 0.01) and P (r = 0.95; P less than 0.005), intersected basal hormonal levels approximately 3 weeks after transfer.

SETTING: The study was undertaken in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein, Republic of South Africa. PATIENTS: Infertile white females, visiting an infertility clinic in an academic hospital and fertile white female patients visiting an antenatal clinic. INTERVENTIONS: Endocervical swabs were taken, and monoclonal direct immunofluorescence for C. Trachomatis were done on each. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A difference was expected between the prevalence of C. trachomatis infection in the fertile and infertile population. RESULTS: In the study group, 14(35.9%) positive, 25(64.1%) negative, and 1 fallout were obtained. In the control group, 3 patients (7.32%) tested positive. CONCLUSION: Although no correlation was found between C. trachomatis infection of the female genital tract and the clinical history, it showed a significant correlation with infertility. This justifies routine screening tests and antibiotic treatment of positive infertile couples. Analysis of cost-effectiveness showed that empirical treatment of new infertile couples is justified in some populations.\r"

DESIGN: Couples who had conceived through TDI in the past 7 years completed a retrospective survey. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five of seventy couples returned completed questionnaires. MEASURES: Demographic questionnaire, TDI, and confidentiality questionnaire (created for this study), Dyadic Adjustment Scale. RESULTS: The majority of the subjects told at least one person about the TDI but 81% of subjects who told someone reported that, if they had to do it over again, they would tell no one. Eighty-six percent reported that they have not and will not tell the child. Time from diagnosis to beginning TDI was not correlated with marital adjustment after TDI. Overall, the couples reported average marital adjustment. For both men and women, the biggest concern was the genetic/medical history of the donor. Most couples did not have psychological counseling, but 39% thought it should be mandatory. CONCLUSIONS: Retrospectively, most couples regretted telling others about TDI. Most couples do not plan to tell the TDI child about its genetic origin. The major concern about TDI is the genetic and medical background of the donor. Psychological counseling should be available to couples undergoing TDI.\r"

RESULTS: Pregnancy in original IVF cycle predicted higher implantation rates at subsequent cryothaw transfers. Similarly, pregnancy in cryothaw cycles was associated with higher implantation and ongoing pregnancy rates at the initial IVF cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Within a cohort of oocytes, pregnancy with some of the pre-embryos in a cohort predicts pregnancy with the remaining oocytes in the cohort.

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We have studied six male adolescents 15 to 19 years of age with bilateral gynecomastia. They were selected among other adolescents with gynecomastia because of the presence of visible varicoceles. All of them had normal physical examination and secondary sexual characteristics. This was prospective study of 3 months' duration. All the patients that were included finished the study. SETTING: All the patients were evaluated in the Endocrine Clinic of Winthrop-University Hospital, a tertiary care unit. INTERVENTION: Serum testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), and estradiol (E2) responses to the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 2,000 IU for 3 consecutive days before and 3 months after varicocelectomy were determined. RESULTS: Varicocelectomy did not cause any significant changes in the basal (pre-hCG) levels of the steroid. However, the increase in T levels achieved with hCG was significantly (P less than 0.005) higher after varicocelectomy (before T, 925 +/- 212 ng%; after T, 1,649 +/- 406 ng%). Simultaneously, the stimulated levels of E2 and A were significantly lower (P less than 0.005) after varicocelectomy (E2, 62 +/- 12 pg/mL; A, 326 ng% +/- 80 ng%) than before (E2, 106 +/- 13 pg/mL; A, 580 ng% +/- 95 ng%). CONCLUSION: The reciprocal effect on the levels of T and its immediate precursor, A, suggests an impairment of the 17-ketoreductase enzyme activity. The increased levels of E2 after hCG and its normalization after varicocelectomy suggests that varicoceles may play a pathogenetic role in the development of gynecomastia.\r"

DESIGN: Serum antisperm antibodies were assayed by an indirect immunobead test and an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Both homologous (human sperm/human zona) and heterologous (human sperm/zona-free hamster ova) sperm/egg interactions were evaluated in the presence of serum antisperm antibodies from patients with CF. SETTING: Cystic Fibrosis Clinic at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, a tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: Fifteen CF patients (10 male and 5 female), 3 non-CF antisperm antibody-positive infertile patients (2 male and 1 female), 20 fertile controls (7 males and 13 females), and 9 fertile sperm donors were used. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum antisperm antibody levels in patients with CF. In those patients with antisperm antibodies, determine effect of these sperm antibodies on sperm/egg interactions and complement-mediated events. RESULTS: Sera from 3 (30%) of 10 men with CF demonstrated immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and/or IgM antisperm antibodies, whereas sera from all 5 CF women and the 20 control sera were negative for antisperm antibodies. The maximal titers for IgG, IgA, and IgM antisperm antibody were 1:8, 192, 1:256, and 1:64, respectively. The immunobead binding, which was restricted to the sperm head and tail-tip or the midpiece and tail-tip, correlated with the indirect immunofluorescence pattern. Antisperm antibody-positive sera from men with CF impaired both the binding and penetration of human zonae and the penetration of hamster ova by human sperm. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other men with congenital or acquired obstruction of their genital tract, antisperm antibodies may occur in some men with CF. Antisperm antibodies may contribute to immune sperm dysfunction in some men with CF by activated complement-mediated events and interfering with sperm/egg interactions.\r"

DESIGN: The development of the assay is in four parts: determine optimal sperm number; demonstrate quality control; establish statistical limits for fertile population; compare results to in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. SETTING AND PATIENTS: A group of 63 patients with oligospermia and/or poor motility and a group of 17 fertile donors were compared using the optimized SPA and the micro-SPA. Sperm from a third group of 35 patients were simultaneously incubated with human ova (IVF) and hamster ova (micro-SPA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Both types of SPA scores are expressed as a sperm capacitation index (penetrations per ovum). Outcome of IVF is expressed as a percent of ova fertilized. RESULTS: Using 25,000 sperm was found to be optimal. The normal fertile range was statistically determined to have a lower limit (-2 SD) of 2.0 penetrations per ovum. When scores from 63 male factor patients were compared using the optimized SPA, only 43% had sufficient swim-up sperm. However, the micro-SPA could accurately test 100% of the samples because it requires only one tenth the number of sperm. CONCLUSION: The micro-SPA provides a valuable diagnostic test for the evaluation of the male factor patient.\r"

If pregnancy did not occur, the alternate medium was used to prepared sperm for the following cycle. SETTING: All patients were treated in our private care center. PATIENTS: Patients entering this study were normally ovulating women undergoing IUI with frozen donor sperm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pregnancy was used as our main outcome measure of success. RESULTS: After 324 cycles of treatment, the PR per cycle of IUI was 17.5% with sperm prepared in human tubal fluid which was significantly different (P = 0.05) from the PR (9.8%) after insemination with sperm prepared in Ham's F-10. There was no statistical difference in the number of motile cells inseminated in each of these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Transitory exposure of the sperm in Ham's F-10 medium to the environment during preparation for insemination may result in an alkalinization of the medium that has a lasting influence on sperm fertility.\r"

SETTING: Animals were maintained in the Center for Experimental Animal Resources, Northwestern University. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum total and unbound cortisol concentrations, serum total and unbound progesterone (P) concentrations, urinary P metabolites. RESULTS: Mean increases in serum cortisol of 56% and 77% above control levels were achieved. Mean serum P concentrations were not decreased with low-dose cortisol phosphate infusion during the 12 days preceding menses, but mean serum P levels were decreased by 69% to 2.3 ng/mL during high-dose cortisol phosphate infusion. No corresponding decrease in excretion of conjugated immunoreactive P metabolites was found in daily urine samples during cortisol phosphate infusion, suggesting that production rates of P were unaltered by the cortisol phosphate treatment. Unbound serum cortisol increased by a mean of 162% above control levels during high-dose cortisol phosphate infusion, but no increase occurred in the percentage of unbound serum P. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that elevation of serum cortisol in the range observed in chronically stressed individuals may severely decrease the available P to target organs by displacement of P from plasma proteins but does not inhibit ovarian steroidogenesis or ovulation.\r"

DESIGN: Male rats received: (1) bilateral vasectomies; (2) vasectomies followed 3 months later by vasovasostomy; or (3) sham operations. SETTING: Research laboratory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fertility was assessed by caging males with three females for 2 weeks and subsequently counting implantation sites. Antisperm antibodies were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluid flow through vas deferens segments was tested in vitro, and testicular structure was studied microscopically. RESULTS: Nearly all vasovasostomized Lewis rats were infertile (33 of 34), whereas 62% (18 of 29) Sprague-Dawley rats were fertile after vasovasostomy (P less than 0.001). In fertile Sprague-Dawley males, significant correlations existed between: (1) implantation sites or females impregnated; and (2) antisperm antibodies early after vasectomy, vas flow, and testicular morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic differences affect fertility after vasovasostomy. Fertility after vasovasostomy is also influenced in a multifactorial manner by the immune response, mechanical elements, and structural changes in the reproductive tract.\r"

In groups 3 and 4, the same solutions were used only after the injury. Postoperative adhesions were assessed at second-look laparotomy. Histologic assessment of the fresh laser injury was carried out on uteri pretreated with hyaluronic acid, PBS, or nothing.

Body fat decreased but this was significantly less in the android (upper body segment) region than in the gynoid (lower body segment) region. Danazol thus has both anabolic and androgenic effects on body composition. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry provides a new, noninvasive, and rapid means of studying body composition.\r"

In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are \"at risk for\" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders.\r"

Nonviral environmental factors peculiar to the affected populations seem to play a prominent etiologic role. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be established by epidemiologic studies alone, we have shown in all three affected population groups that individuals develop the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis variant of this disorder after heavy exposure to the raw or incompletely detoxified seed of neurotoxic cycad plants. Since long periods may elapse between cycad exposure and the appearance of neurological disease in humans, cycads may harbor a \"slow toxin\" that causes the postmitotic neuron to undergo slow irreversible degeneration. Two cycad neurotoxins are recognized, one of which (cycasin) is known to have long-latency effects (tumorigenesis) on mitotic neurons and replicating cells in other tissues. This paper explores the possible relationship between tumorigenesis and long-latency neurotoxicity, and discusses possible biologic markers of cycad exposure and subclinical neurodegenerative disease.\r"

As a number of motor and nonmotor manifestations of the disease emerge months to years before a diagnosis can be made, a battery of clinical tests might be sufficient to identify individuals at an earlier stage than is currently possible using the standard history and physical examination. A list of questions regarding possible risk factors, specific symptoms, and observations of family members could be combined in a self-administered questionnaire that might identify individuals with a high probability of early, but otherwise undiagnosable, Parkinson's disease. Identification of subtle motor features is another possible screening method. For example, handwriting and speech are commonly affected prior to diagnosis; thus, automated analysis of these motor actions might also provide detection of incipient disease.\r"

We have recently demonstrated that the odor identification and detection deficits of patients with PD are equivalent to those of patients with mild AD when subtle differences in cognitive function are statistically controlled for by analysis of covariance. In contrast, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and patients with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism evidence olfactory function much more similar to that of normal controls. In the present study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and the Picture Identification Test to 24 patients with early signs of the PDC of Guam and statistically compared their test scores to those of 24 early-stage AD and 24 early-stage PD patients of similar age and gender from the United States mainland. Although the PDC group evidenced slightly more difficulty in identifying pictures than did the other 2 groups, the odor identification deficit associated with this disorder was of the same magnitude as that observed in AD and PD, suggesting that olfactory testing cannot be used to distinguish among these 3 diseases and that the olfactory dysfunction of these disorders may reflect a common neurologic substrate.\r"

The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs.\r"

Specific enzymes implicated include several P450 enzymes, most notably P450 IID6, and cysteine dioxygenase.

Three lung hyperinflation breaths, at one of five randomly ordered volumes (tidal volume, 12 cc/kg, 14 cc/kg, 16 cc/kg, or 18 cc/kg of lean body weight) were delivered, by a ventilator (fraction of inspired oxygen 1.0), followed by 10 seconds of continuous suction. Lung hyperinflation and suctioning were repeated three times. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant increase (p = 0.000) in PaO2 immediately after the third suction pass, which was volume dependent (p = 0.009). A statistically significant (p less than 0.001) increase in heart rate from baseline occurred over the three lung hyperinflation-suctioning sequences that was not volume dependent. The mean increase in heart rate was 6.8 beats/min. The majority of rhythm changes for lung hyperinflation and suctioning were from normal sinus rhythm to sinus tachycardia. Suction was associated with a greater incidence of rhythm (53.9%) and arrhythmia (80.8%) changes. The most frequent arrhythmia was premature atrial contraction.\r"

In many patients correction of fluid and electrolyte status does not fully correct the metabolic derangement. In this study we examined the effect of 500 mg of intravenous acetazolamide, after correcting for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, on the acid-base status of 30 ventilated patients. In all patients studied there was a fall of total serum bicarbonate; the mean reduction at 24 hours was 6.4 mmol/L, with a normalization of the base excess and pH. The onset of action was rapid (within 2 hours), and the maximal effect occurred at a mean of 15.5 hours, although there was wide variation. The effect of acetazolamide was still apparent at 48 hours. No adverse effects were noted. We conclude that in patients with metabolic alkalosis, once fluid and electrolyte abnormalities have been corrected, acetazolamide is an effective and safe form of therapy with a quick onset and long duration of action.\r"

Estimates of internal consistency reliability, content validity, and concurrent and discriminant validity were moderately strong. The most problematic side effects were related to lack of sleep, vivid or active dreams, lack of energy and pep, diminished interest in sexual activity, and changes in vision. Among self-management practices used to mediate side effects were planning rest and activity periods, thinking carefully before reacting, and seeking out others for support.\r"

Simulation performance was measured by proficiency score (comparison with expert performance), patient outcome (cure or die), and amount of data collected before the first intervention. Mean proficiency scores were 51% for atrial flutter and 35% for ventricular tachycardia. Thirteen percent of the atrial flutter and 35% of the ventricular tachycardia simulations ended in patient death. Failure to recognize ventricular tachycardia and unfamiliarity with second- and third-line treatments were major sources of error. Medication errors were the cause of death in 87% of the simulations ending in patient death. These results document the need for emphasis on dysrhythmia management in the critical care curriculum.\r"

Without the a priori examination of the power of the test of significance, there is no assurance that the sample is sufficient to discern significant differences. Formulas for calculating effect size are provided for t tests, correlations, chi-square, analysis of variance, and regression. Examples of calculating the effect size by using four different statistical tests based on research studies are presented: t tests with unequal variance between groups, chi-square, an analysis of variance, and regression.

  ".U": "91373204\r", 
  ".W": "Treatment of coronary thrombosis with thrombolytic agents was first introduced in the 1950s. Clinical trials, primarily with streptokinase during the 1960s and 1970s, addressed the effects of thrombolysis on mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction, but were inconclusive and largely ignored. In 1976, Chazov et al. from the Soviet Union demonstrated that intracoronary streptokinase could produce prompt recanalization of a totally occluded infarct-related artery. In 1980, DeWood et al. demonstrated that 87% of patients with classic Q-wave myocardial infarction had total occlusion from coronary thrombosis of the infarct-related artery when studied during the first 4 hours of their infarction and that 65% of these arteries were still occluded when patients were studied between 12 and 24 hours after infarction. These observations stimulated renewed interest in thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Mortality trials have subsequently demonstrated that agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex remarkably reduce early mortality rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction when treatment is instituted within the first 6 hours of infarction. Benefit has yet to be demonstrated, however, in patients with acute myocardial infarction characterized by ST-segment depression. This whole area is currently under study by the TIMI investigators. TIMI-3B is a mortality study in which patients with either non-Q-wave myocardial infarction or unstable angina with rest pain are randomly assigned to receive either tissue plasminogen activator or placebo. Results of this trial will help us in the future to determine the appropriate role of thrombolytic therapy in treating acute ischemic syndromes other than transmural myocardial infarction.\r"

Nurses and physicians caring for patients with acute myocardial infarction must be aware of inclusion and exclusion criteria, drug preparation, dosage and administration, recommended adjunctive therapies, and potential complications associated with pharmacologic thrombolysis. All patients with acute myocardial infarction should be carefully screened for their potential for receiving thrombolytic therapy with a favorable benefit/risk ratio.\r"

Approximately 50% of patients hospitalized for suspected acute myocardial infarction do not use the emergency medical service system. Delay before treatment can be divided into several components: patient delay, emergency medical service delay, and hospital delay. Factors contributing to delay in each component and possible approaches to decreasing these delays are discussed.

The following variables are associated with increased delay: a medical history of angina, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; older age; black race; seeking advice from a family member or a physician; symptom onset on a weekday; and attempts at self-treatment. Variables associated with reduced delay times are the following: pain recognized as cardiac in origin, hemodynamic instability, severe chest pain, younger age, and consultation with a coworker. Surprisingly, patients who have already experienced a myocardial infarction are just as likely to delay as patients who have not had this experience. These findings provide direction for developing and testing patient and family interventions, establishing community education programs, and reducing patient delay in response to the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Some entry delays are due to patient decisions and interactions with others. In the United States, prehospital care is delivered by a variety of different systems, varying from public service types such as fire-department based to private types of service. These personnel vary in level of training from paramedics with a high level of training to Emergency Medical Technicians-Ambulance with basic training (first aid), even less in some areas. The training should be upgraded so that training as an emergency medical technician with the ability to defibrillate would be the minimum level for emergency ambulance personnel; wherever economically and logistically feasible, ambulance personnel should be paramedics. Although the 911 emergency telephone system exists in some areas, there is no centralized, universal system for access, causing confusion and delays in obtaining care in critical situations such as cardiac arrest. There is a need for a national emergency number--911--with the ability to identify the calling number and address. Since dispatchers have little medical dispatch training, needed instructions are not given to the caller, which can reduce the patient's chance of survival. Trained dispatchers are needed to dispatch resources efficiently and to offer assistance until trained rescuers arrive. Ambulances are inefficiently located in some areas of the United States, slowing response to the patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It has been suggested that all patients with acute myocardial infarction who might benefit from thrombolytic therapy should receive treatment within the first \"golden hour\" of arrival at the hospital ED. Busy urban medical centers, particularly public hospitals serving a large proportion of indigent patients, face special challenges in attempting to meet this goal. ED overcrowding, in part caused by patient \"dumping,\" and diminishing governmental financial support have created an environment in which rapid triage and treatment are difficult. Because only 4% to 5% of all patients who are seen in the ED with chest pain actually require thrombolytic therapy, there is negative reinforcement for the triage nursing staff. The busy urban ED environment also creates greater litigation potential for the physician and nurse. Problems created by the busy ED environment can be minimized by providing adequate nursing staff, standing orders and protocols for evaluation of the patient with chest pain, equipment for an immediate electrocardiogram, and a thrombolytic drug stock in the ED. Hospital administrators must recognize the unique problems created in the ED when inpatient beds are unavailable. The hospital must also have efficient bed turnover and a community-wide plan for dealing with patients when the ED \"closes\" to incoming ambulance traffic. Governmental entities must recognize the consequences of their actions in curtailing health care benefits for those who cannot afford care in private hospitals.\r"

The distance of this line from the centre of the knee on a long-leg radiograph provides the most accurate measure of coronal alignment. Malalignment causes abnormal forces which may lead to loosening after knee replacement. We report a series of 115 Denham knee replacements performed between 1976 and 1981 using the earliest design of components, inserted with intramedullary guide rods. Patients were assessed clinically and long-leg standing radiographs were taken before operation, soon after surgery and up to 12 years later. In two-thirds of the knees (68%) Maquet's line passed through the middle third of the prosthesis on postoperative films and the incidence of subsequent loosening was 3%. When Maquet's line was medial or lateral to this, an error of approximately +/- 3 degrees, the incidence of loosening at a median period of eight years was 24%. This difference is highly significant (p = 0.001). Accurate coronal alignment appears to be an important factor in prevention of loosening. Means of improving the accuracy of alignment and of measuring it on long-leg radiographs are discussed.\r"

Above-knee amputated limbs were fixed in different positions of rotation and of knee flexion and radiographed to study the effect on the apparent alignment of the limb. If the limb was rotated no more than 10 degrees from the neutral the effect on apparent axial alignment was minimal and radiographic measurement was reliable. This suggests that standardised positioning jigs are not needed in routine clinical practice.\r"

In seven of these knees an elongated tibial stem was also required, though the tibial shaft was replaced in only two of them. There were many complications. Fracture of the femur at the tip of the femoral stem was the most frequent. Sixteen first revisions failed and were revised a second time; 12 required replacement of the distal femoral shaft and three required replacement of the proximal tibia. The incidence of complications in knees requiring a second revision was even higher. Four required a third revision after an average interval of three years. Failure of a hinged prosthesis results in bone loss mainly in the femur. Revision of a failed hinged prosthesis with another of the same design is unlikely to be successful and may cause fracture of the femur.\r"

  ".W": "Over a 16-year period, 135 custom-made distal femoral prostheses, based on a fully constrained Stanmore-type knee replacement, were used in the treatment of primary malignant or aggressive benign tumours. Survivorship analysis showed a cumulative success rate of 72% at five years and 64% at seven years. Intact prostheses in 91% of the surviving patients gave good or excellent functional results. Deep infection was the major complication, occurring in 6.8% of cases; clinical aseptic loosening occurred in 6.0%. Revision surgery was carried out for loosening and infection, and the early results are encouraging. We conclude that prosthetic replacement of the distal femur can meet the objectives of limb salvage surgery.\r"

The areas measured were inside the lesser trochanter and 4.8 cm distal to it. The contralateral hip served as the control. Three years after arthroplasty there was 40% loss in average bone mineral content inside the lesser trochanter, and 28% loss in average bone mineral content 4.8 cm distally in the medial cortex. At seven to 14 years after operation, patients had lost 40% of bone proximally and 49% distally. The data suggest that this may progress in a proximal-to-distal fashion, and could account for a 50% decrease in bone mass seven to 14 years after surgery.\r"

In the middle and superficial zones, collagen was organised in a layered or leaf-like manner. The orientation was vertical in the intermediate zone, curving to become horizontal and parallel to the articular surface in the superficial zone. Each leaf consisted of a fine network of collagen fibrils. Adjacent leaves merged or were closely linked by bridging fibrils and were arranged according to the split-line pattern. The surface layer (lamina splendens) was morphologically distinct. Although ordered, the overall collagen structure was different in each plane (anisotropic) a property described in previous morphological and biophysical studies. As all components of the articular cartilage matrix interact closely, the three-dimensional organisation of collagen is important when considering cartilage function and the processes of cartilage growth, injury and repair.\r"

Delay in healing of the devascularised osteotomies was suggested by an in vivo monitoring system and confirmed by post-mortem mechanical testing. We suggest that the osteogenic stimulus of dynamic external fixation is dependent on the early restoration of cortical blood flow in devascularised fractures.\r"

They showed a sevenfold hypersensitivity to killing by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation and a diminished level (29%) of unscheduled DNA synthesis. Phototesting revealed delayed maximum erythema at 72 hours after UVB exposure and a lowered minimal erythema dose. Lentigo maligna developed on the patient's face, and a rapidly growing malignant schwannoma was found on the left trigeminal nerve.

Light microscopy revealed an accumulation of doubly refractile golden yellow granules in the papillary dermis, mostly scattered, with some concentration around the blood vessels but not in the endothelial cells. Electron micrographs showed numerous amorphous electron-dense inclusion bodies in histiocytes, phagocytes, fibroblasts, and dermal dendrocytes. Melanosomes were phagocytosed in the same cells but in separated locations. Imipramine is structurally related to chlorpromazine and can cause slate-gray discoloration. However, the color of the granules deposited in the papillary dermis is golden-yellow and they are not deposited in endothelial cells.\r"

We describe the clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural findings for a 30-year-old patient who had a mild form of Proteus syndrome with linear lesions characterized by a mixed pattern of hyperkeratosis and depigmentation. Light microscopy of the linear nevus showed acanthosis and hyperorthokeratosis. Electron microscopy revealed extensive vacuolation at the interface between melanocytes and keratinocytes, with large aggregations of densely packed granules in the intercellular space. Melanocytes showed only slight degenerative changes. An immunohistochemical study of the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors revealed no significant abnormalities.\r"

  ".U": "91373726\r", 
  ".W": "Endocardial mapping of electrical activity was carried out in 150 patients to guide antiarrhythmic surgery for drug-resistant ventricular tachycardia in the chronic phase of myocardial infarction. In 20 of these patients, the activation pattern of 27 distinct tachycardias was focal and diastolic potentials were recorded at three or more sites. In 26 tachycardias, the sequence of diastolic potentials progressed from the area of latest activation of one cycle toward the \"origin\" of the next cycle. In two patients, the heart was stimulated during tachycardia, resulting in entrainment of the tachycardia in both. Late potentials were recorded during entrainment at sites where diastolic potentials occurred during tachycardia. In 11 of the 20 patients, endocardial mapping was performed during sinus rhythm. In four of these, late potentials were observed during sinus rhythm at sites where diastolic potentials were recorded during tachycardia. In two patients without late potentials during sinus rhythm, late potentials were observed during stimulation and induced ectopic beats. The results support the concept that the mechanism of several of these tachycardias is based on reentry in a macrocircuit comprising a tract of surviving tissue traversing the infarct and the remaining healthy tissue. They also indicate that the absence of late potentials during sinus rhythm does not guarantee the absence of arrhythmogenic pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Although sympathetic mechanisms play a major role in buffering abrupt arterial pressure reductions, including those that occur during tachyarrhythmias, human sympathetic nervous system responses to ventricular tachycardia have not been measured. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded directly from the peroneal nerve in 16 patients during diagnostic induction of 19 episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (average rate 189 beats/min, range 130 to 250). Average systolic and diastolic pressures decreased from 149/78 to 61/49 mm Hg by 10 s and increased toward baseline levels to 88/64 mm Hg by 1 min of ventricular tachycardia. Average sympathetic nerve activity increased by 92% at 10 s in direct proportion to arterial pressure reductions and in inverse proportion to ventricular rate and remained 83% above baseline levels at 1 min. The late recovery of arterial pressure during ventricular tachycardia was related significantly to the magnitude of early sympathetic responses. Sympathetic activity tended to lose its discrete bursting pattern during ventricular tachycardia, and power spectral analysis showed that the large sympathetic peaks at the heart rate frequency present during sinus rhythm are absent during ventricular tachycardia. This study is the first to delineate human sympathetic nervous system responses to ventricular tachycardia. The results suggest that in the patients studied, large early sympathetic surges differed from those that occur during sinus rhythm and contributed to hemodynamic stability during ventricular tachycardia.\r"

As ascertained from intracardiac recordings, 86 tachycardias were ventricular and 35 were supraventricular with aberrant conduction. Early or late peaking of the predominant QRS deflection in lead MCL6 or V6 proved valuable in diagnosing wide complex tachycardia. An interval of less than or equal to 50 ms from the onset of the QRS complex to the predominant peak (or nadir) indicated supraventricular tachycardia; an interval of greater than or equal to 70 ms indicated ventricular tachycardia. The QRS complexes in leads MCL1 and MCL6 were comparable to those in leads V1 and V6 during sinus rhythm. Significant discrepancies in QRS configuration occurred between the modified and conventional precordial leads during ventricular tachycardia, especially between leads MCL1 and V1; however. these differences did not affect diagnostic accuracy. A single MCL1, V1, MCL6 or V6 lead was equally valuable in the diagnosis of wide complex tachycardia and far superior to a single lead II. A combination of leads (MCL1 + MCL6), (V1 + V6), (V1 + I + aVF) or (V1 + V6 + I + aVF) was superior to a single lead or the routinely monitored lead V1 + II combination.\r"

In all 18, discrimination of anterograde from retrograde conduction at a single atrial site was examined; in 5 of the 18, multiple sites were examined to determine if the discriminatory ability of the catheter was site dependent. The catheter was specially designed with bipoles in the x, y and z directions. A vector was computed for each electrogram during anterograde and retrograde conduction. Electrogram amplitude along the standard bipole was also compared for anterograde and retrograde conduction. Mean electrogram amplitude for the standard bipole was significantly different for anterograde than for retrograde conduction in 17 of 18 patients (mean +/- SD 4 +/- 1.9 vs. 2.7 +/- 1.3 mV; p less than 0.005), with complete separation of amplitude distributions in 4 patients. The electrogram vector during anterograde conduction was significantly different from that during retrograde conduction in all 18 patients (p less than 0.0001), with complete separation of vector distributions in 14. In some patients with multiple site recordings, the choice of site greatly affected separation based on electrogram amplitude or vector, or both. The orthogonal catheter can be used to sense directional differences in local endocardial activation. The catheter shows promise for discriminating anterograde from retrograde conduction and examining the direction of endocardial activation in the heart during an electrophysiologic examination.\r"

The basic lesion is a peculiar vasculitis that affects mainly the intima, showing the features of an endovasculitis. Vessels of every type and size are involved, affecting practically every organ. The vascular lesions begins with endothelial damage that varies from cellular swelling to cellular necrosis. It then progresses by mixed cellular inflammatory infiltration of the intima and, in some cases, of the media and adventitia. In some cases the infiltrate is rich in eosinophils and a few show foamy histiocytes. Proliferation of myointimal cells and in advanced stages fibroblastic proliferation causes narrowing or obliteration of the vascular lumen. Thromboembolic complications perpetuate the vascular lesion and compound the ischemia and parenchymal atrophy of several organs. The peripheral nerve lesions begin with an inflammatory neuropathy with lymphocytic perineuritis and progress to perineural fibrosis with secondary axonal degeneration. Skeletal muscle lesions exhibit an interstitial inflammatory myopathy at first, followed by a neurogenic muscular atrophy. A direct effect of unidentified toxic substances, possibly free radicals, may cause the endothelial lesion. Other factors, such as immunopathologic mechanisms of delayed hypersensitivity, may contribute to the progression of the vascular lesions.\r"

Five neonates had severe systemic AV valve regurgitation with severe coarctation of the aorta (n = 4) or aortic atresia (n = 1) and presented with heart failure. Four died in the neonatal period and one who had coarctation repair died 7 months postoperatively. The remaining five patients with congenitally corrected transposition and Ebstein's anomaly had mild left AV valve regurgitation; none of these had aortic arch obstruction. In neonates who have coexisting Ebstein's anomaly of the systemic AV valve and congenitally corrected transposition, obstruction to aortic arch flow is common. Severe systemic AV valve regurgitation with a morphologic systemic right ventricle may have contributed to low anterograde flow in the ascending aorta prenatally and thereby to the aortic arch abnormality.\r"

Clinical improvement with increased functional capacity occurred during treatment. Maximal work load increased by 25% (104 to 130 W; p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic data showed an increased cardiac index (3.8 to 4.6 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.02) during exercise. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased at rest (20 to 13 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and during exercise (32 to 28 mm Hg; p = NS). Stroke volume index (30 to 39 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) and stroke work index (28 to 46 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) increased during exercise and long-term metoprolol treatment. The arterial norepinephrine concentration decreased at rest (3.72 to 2.19 nmol/liter; p less than 0.02) but not during exercise (13.2 to 11.1 nmol/liter; p = NS). The arterial-coronary sinus norepinephrine difference suggested a decrease in myocardial spillover during metoprolol treatment (-0.28 to -0.13 nmol/liter; p = NS at rest and -1.13 to -0.27 nmol/liter; p less than 0.05 during exercise). Coronary sinus blood flow was unchanged during treatment. Four patients produced myocardial lactate before the study, but none produced lactate after beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). There was no obvious improvement in a subgroup of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In summary, there were signs of increased myocardial work load without higher metabolic costs after treatment with metoprolol.\r"

One treadmill test was obtained from each patient to provide baseline measurements without a preceding intravenous infusion and in the absence of all antianginal drugs including nifedipine; two additional exercise tests were preceded by an infusion and 10 mg of bite-and-swallow nifedipine. The infusions, administered in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion, consisted of either 10 ml of 10% calcium chloride (13.6 mEq) in 50 ml of 5% dextrose in water or 5% dextrose in water alone. Rest systolic blood pressure (134 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) was unchanged after placebo infusion (135 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) but decreased to 124 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) 25 min after nifedipine administration.

Despite a decrease at the time of peak nifedipine effect after either infusion, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower after administration of nifedipine alone than after administration of calcium and nifedipine (124 +/- 4.1 vs. 135 +/- 4.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although thrombolytic therapy has been shown to limit infarct size, preserve left ventricular ejection fraction and decrease mortality in most subgroups of patients, no apparent benefit has been demonstrated in patients with clinical left ventricular dysfunction. The lack of correlation between ejection fraction and other measurements of left ventricular dysfunction such as exercise time, cardiac output, filling pressures, activation of the neurohumoral system and regional perfusion bed abnormalities may partly explain this paradox. Alternatively, lower perfusion rates, higher reocclusion rates, associated mechanical complications or completed infarction may explain these findings. Preliminary data indicate that emergency coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery improves survival in selected patients with cardiogenic shock. Because these findings suggest that restoration of infarct artery patency is especially important in patients with clinical left ventricular dysfunction, additional studies are needed in these patients to investigate the potential benefit that new thrombolytic strategies, inotropic or vasodilator agents or intraaortic balloon counterpulsation might offer by augmenting coronary blood flow and improving reperfusion rates. Currently, acute mechanical revascularization should be considered for patients who present with congestive heart failure associated with hypotension or tachycardia and for patients with cardiogenic shock.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of patients with aortic regurgitation with vasodilators reduces regurgitant volume, ventricular dilation and left ventricular mass. Although these effects are presumably due to afterload reduction, it is also possible that the aortic regurgitant orifice area is not constant. To test the latter hypothesis, aortic regurgitation was created in 10 open chest sheep by partial resection of the noncoronary leaflet under direct visualization. Regurgitant flow was measured with an aortic supravalvular electromagnetic probe; aortic and left ventricular pressures were measured with catheter-tipped micromanometer pressure transducers. The effective regurgitant orifice area was calculated by a modification of the continuity equation in a manner similar to the Gorlin equation. The regurgitant orifice area was measured three times: after aortic regurgitation was created, after mean arterial pressure was increased by 15 to 25 mm Hg with intravenous dopamine and after mean arterial pressure was reduced by 15 to 25 mm Hg with intravenous sodium nitroprusside. Comparison of regurgitant volumes and areas obtained after creation of aortic regurgitation and at the conclusion of the experiment in the absence of dopamine or sodium nitroprusside demonstrated no significant change over time. Dopamine administration was associated with an 86 +/- 81% increase in regurgitant volume (p less than 0.01) and a 38 +/- 44% increase in regurgitant orifice area (p less than 0.01). Sodium nitroprusside administration resulted in a 51 +/- 14% decrease in regurgitant volume (p less than 0.001) and a 28 +/- 21% reduction in regurgitant orifice area (p = 0.007). In this model of acute aortic regurgitation, the effective regurgitant orifice area was altered by increasing or decreasing the aortic transvalvular pressure gradient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A transient decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure (from 121.3 +/- 24.5 to 94.2 +/- 18.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and wall motion abnormality were noted in dogs with direct current shock.

Cardiac responses to intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 micrograms/kg body weight epinephrine (10 normokalemic and 11 hypokalemic dogs) and to rapidly increased preload (8 dogs in each group) were evaluated. Hypokalemic dogs received a low potassium diet plus chlorthalidone. Plasma potassium levels were lower (p less than 0.001) in the hypokalemic dogs (3.2 +/- 0.1 mEq/liter [mean +/- SEM]) than in the normokalemic dogs (4.1 +/- 0.1). The inotropic response to epinephrine was lower in hypokalemic than in normokalemic dogs, the response of the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure was 20% greater (p less than 0.03) and the response of the peak rate of change of ejection power was 60% greater in the normokalemic dogs. The relaxation response to epinephrine (the maximal rate of fall of left ventricular pressure) was 33% lower (p less than 0.02) in hypokalemic dogs. Responses to rapid volume expansion were impaired by hypokalemia; maximal stroke volume index was 31% lower (p less than 0.01), maximal cardiac index was 26% lower (p less than 0.01) and the peak response to the maximal rate of filling was 51% lower (p less than 0.01). There were no differences in basal cardiac function. Therefore, modest potassium depletion within the clinical range impaired the contractile and relaxation responses to epinephrine and preload and impaired rapid filling.\r"

In three cases, three distinct mechanisms of right to left interatrial shunting in the absence of right ventricular systolic hypertension were identified: 1) transient spontaneous reversal of the left to right atrial pressure differential with each cardiac cycle; 2) sustained elevation of right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure induced by respiratory maneuvers; and 3) aberrant flow redirection across the foramen ovale due to a large right atrial mass. Any of these three mechanisms may be operative during paradoxic embolism in the absence of elevation of right ventricular pressures.\r"

Symptoms of class IV angina, vertebrobasilar insufficiency and occupational arm claudication that developed after bypass surgery were promptly relieved after balloon dilation. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery can be performed safely and provides an alternative to carotid-subclavian or axillary-axillary bypass surgery for treatment of internal mammary artery graft malfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The safety and efficacy of a 10- to 15-mg/h continuous infusion of intravenous diltiazem were evaluated in 47 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter who first responded to 20 mg or 20 mg followed by one or more 25-mg bolus doses of open label intravenous diltiazem. Of the 47 patients, 44 responded to the bolus injection and were randomized under double-blind conditions to receive either a continuous infusion of intravenous diltiazem (10 to 15 mg/h) (23 patients) or placebo (21 patients) for up to 24 h. Seventeen (74%) of the 23 patients receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 h (p less than 0.001). Over 24 h, patients receiving diltiazem infusion lost response significantly more slowly than did those receiving placebo infusion (p less than 0.001). Nonresponders to the double-blind infusion were given an additional bolus injection of open label intravenous diltiazem and administered an open label 24-h intravenous diltiazem infusion. The overall proportion of patients maintaining a response to a 24-h infusion of intravenous diltiazem under double-blind or open label conditions combined was 83% (34 of 41). Efficacy of the 24-h infusion of intravenous diltiazem was similar in elderly versus young patients, those who did versus those who did not receive digoxin and those weighing less than 84 versus greater than or equal to 84 kg. However, intravenous diltiazem appeared to be more effective in atrial fibrillation than in atrial flutter. No significant untoward effects were noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
