Assessment of the carnitine status of an individual is compromised by limited data on the number of metabolic compartments of carnitine and their interrelationship, if any. Possible compartmentalization of carnitine in the blood of healthy adults was investigated because blood is one of the more readily available samples for the assessment of carnitine status. The data suggest that blood carnitine is partitioned into a plasma carnitine compartment and a red blood cell carnitine compartment, compartments that are separate and distinct metabolic compartments.\r"

Sensory estimates of sweetness and fat content of 20 different mixtures of milk, cream, and sugar did not differ among subject groups. In contrast, relative preferences for sugar vs fat as determined by the Response Surface Method differed between patients with eating disorders and control subjects. Normal-weight bulimic patients preferred sweeter stimuli than did control subjects. Anorectic-restrictor and anorectic-bulimic patients liked sweet but disliked high-fat stimuli and showed elevated optimal sugar:fat (S:F) ratios. This pattern of response did not change following weight regain. The stability of preference profiles suggests that taste responsiveness may be independent of diagnostic categories, bulimic behaviors, or acute changes in body weight.\r"

Removal of phytic acid from and addition of Ca to navy bean flour increased the starch digestion in vitro and raised the glycemic response in vivo while readdition of phytic acid to dephytinized flour produced the opposite effect. Carbohydrate malabsorption assessed by breath H2 measurement related negatively to glycemic response but the changes observed were much lower than the changes in glycemic response. This study confirmed the role of both added and endogenous phytic acid in slowing the in vitro rate of starch digestibility and in vivo glycemic response to legumes and the ability of Ca to modify this effect.\r"

The anterior tissues contained 0.4 +/- 0.2 mg/100 g (n = 19 donors). No significant correlation with age was found. Purified bovine interstitial retinol-binding protein (IRBP) bound exogenous 3H-alpha-tocopherol, which could be displaced by unlabeled all-trans retinol (KD = 10(-6) M). Much higher concentrations of unlabeled alpha-tocopherol were required to achieve a partial displacement of bound 3H-all-trans retinol.

The ratios of tocopherol:cholesterol and tocopherol:triglyceride were similar for adipose tissue, adipocytes, oil, and interface. The bulk lipid (oil plus interface fractions) of the adipocytes contained 99% of the tocopherol, 98% of the triglyceride, and 91% of the cholesterol. The tocopherol:cholesterol ratio was nearly eightfold greater in the bulk lipid than in the bilayer membrane fraction. By use of radioactively labeled tocopherol and cholesterol, it was demonstrated that the isolation protocol did not alter the distribution of the intracellular lipids; furthermore, the tocopherol in the lipid droplet did not readily exchange. Thus, the majority of tocopherol in adipose tissue is located in the bulk-lipid stores.\r"

Diets contained 9 g nitrogen (N) per day with soy protein and synthetic L-amino acids as the N sources in PII and PIII. In PII, subjects were in negative N balance whereas, in PIII, four subjects were in positive N balance. On the last day of each period, fasting subjects ingested a dose of nicotinamide (NAM, 102 mumol/kg body wt). Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for methylated derivatives of NAM by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. Mean values of methylated metabolites in urine from the three diet periods (for four subjects in N balance during PIII) were not different (59.8, 56.7, and 59.9 mumol/(kg body wt X 24 h) for PI, PII, and PIII, respectively). Plasma values of these metabolites also were similar. Results suggest that during a 2-wk period of negative N balance due to a low-methionine intake hepatic methylation processes are not impaired. These processes appear to have a higher metabolic priority than maintenance of the net protein synthesis rate.\r"

Lower hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) counts and higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV) occurred after 13 wk in alcohol-fed monkeys, later in controls. Plasma, RBC, and liver folate declined and urinary formiminoglutamic acid (FIGLU) was elevated in both groups with FIGLU increasing more among alcohol-fed monkeys at 38 wk. After 40 wk, the bioavailability of oral 3H-folic acid was investigated and showed increased fecal and reduced urinary tritium excretion in alcohol-fed monkeys compared with controls while plasma uptake and liver and whole body tritium retention were similar in both groups. These observations demonstrate that chronic alcohol consumption impairs folate coenzymes, accelerates appearance of hematologic indices of megaloblastic anemia, and causes possible malabsorption of enterohepatically circulated folates in folate deficiency even when other essential nutrients are provided.\r"

Tryp deficiency caused classical manifestations of pellagra although niacin intake was in excess of normal requirements. At marginal Zn intakes, oral PA caused a significant increase of plasma Zn and, compared with Tryp-adequate controls, Tryp deficiency resulted in lower plasma Zn and plasma:bone Zn ratios. Extra Zn (total 24 micrograms/g) was ineffective. Subcutaneous PA showed a tendency to lower plasma Zn. PA had no effect on clinical manifestations. We conclude that a Tryp metabolite other than nicotinic acid is necessary in the prevention of pellagra. Our hypothesis links this finding with the observed Tryp and PA effect on Zn metabolism.\r"

By use of the in vivo intestinal-loop methods in rats, absorption of [3H] folic acid was significantly decreased in the presence of either drug. Kinetic studies using the influx chamber method demonstrated a pattern of competitive inhibition of folate transport. [3H] folic acid absorption from jejunal loops was determined 3-16 h after IV administration of methotrexate; this treatment abolished DHFR activity in the small intestine. In rats pretreated with methotrexate, luminal disappearance and systemic absorption of folic acid were significantly enhanced with respect to controls. Trimethoprim and pyrimethamine are weak competitive inhibitors of intestinal folate transport and folate absorption inhibition occurs at the site of membrane transport and appears to be unrelated to concurrent inhibition of DHFR activity in enterocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Four cases of sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML) from Finland were studied clinically and immunohistologically. Three patients had histologically verified extranodal manifestations that often caused the most prominent clinical symptoms. Upper respiratory tract obstruction resulting from SHML lesions was present in two cases, multiple bone lesions in one case, and skin lesions in one case. Clinical remission was observed in all cases, but the course was often protracted. Immunohistochemical studies revealed S-100 protein and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) positivity in most large pale cytoplasmic histiocyte-like cells in all cases, whereas lysozyme was not present in these cells. Sinus cells in ordinary sinus histiocytosis were constantly positive for ACT and variably positive for lysozyme and were generally negative for S-100 protein. The large histiocyte-like cells in SHML resemble interdigitating reticulum cells and Langerhans' cells in their S-100 protein positivity but differ from these cells by morphologic characteristics and the presence of alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, a marker constantly seen in ordinary histiocytes. These results suggest that SHML is a proliferative condition of histiocyte-related cells, which share some properties of histiocytes and some of interdigitating reticulum cells. Further studies are necessary to clarify the nature of the peculiar histiocyte-like cells in SHML.\r"

  ".U": "87323051\r", 
  ".W": "Vimentin has been regarded as the intermediate filament characteristic of normal and neoplastic mesenchymal cells and keratins as typical of epithelial cells and the neoplasms derived from them. However, many epithelial cells in tissue culture or in effusion, as well as cells in some solid epithelial neoplasms such as renal, endometrial, ovarian, pulmonary, and thyroid adenocarcinomas, have been shown to coexpress vimentin and keratin. The recent availability of monoclonal antibodies that work reasonably well in paraffin-embedded tissue led us to carry out a comprehensive immunohistochemical study on formalin- and alcohol-fixed specimens of neoplasms in which we used monoclonal antibodies against vimentin. These results were compared with our previous study in which the same tumor tissues were investigated using antibodies against keratin. The antigenicity of vimentin was found to be preserved in all alcohol-fixed specimens and in 63% of formalin-fixed tissues. Vimentin was the sole intermediate filament present in virtually all sarcomas, meningiomas, schwannomas, and melanomas. In addition, variable percentages (10-57%) of carcinomas, neuroendocrine carcinomas, neuroblastomas, thymomas, and mesotheliomas were positive for vimentin, which, except in the neuroblastomas, was coexpressed with keratins. Among the adenocarcinomas, more than 50% of papillary carcinomas of the thyroid, as well as renal, endometrial, ovarian, and lung carcinomas, coexpressed keratins and vimentin. A distinctive paranuclear and basal localization of vimentin was observed in the cells of many of these tumors, in contrast to the predominantly apical distribution of the keratins. The authors conclude that coexpression of vimentin and keratin is more widespread than previously reported and that antibodies to vimentin, by themselves, are of limited value for the differentiation of epithelial from mesenchymal neoplasms.\r"

In 13 of 15 cases of HD with a diagnostic (positive-A) AChE pattern, the H and E sections confirmed the diagnosis. In five cases with other AChE patterns, the H and E sections were instrumental when the diagnosis was made. Of the 76 non-HD subjects with positive-B (n = 8), equivocal (n = 6), and negative (n = 62) AChE patterns, the H and E sections eliminated the diagnosis in 62 (81%). Neuronal and nerve fiber morphologic characteristics were excellent. Rebiopsies were needed in 14 subjects (19%) when there was failure in finding neurons.

The assay uses a conventional clinical blood cell analyzer to size a patient's red blood cell neocyte population, which relates to the reticulocyte fraction in a linear fashion. Blood is layered atop Stractan (arabino-galactan polysaccharide) and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 1,500 X g. This density medium fractionation process enriches the Stractan layer with neocytes by up to 20-fold as determined by G6PD enzyme analysis. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the red blood cells partitioning in the Stractan layer and the starting whole blood is then measured. The ratio of the two MCV measurements is then related to the reticulocyte percentage by a standard curve. In 93 patients, the derived MCV ratio was linearly correlated with manual reticulocyte counts (r = 0.96/slope = 0.99). Agreement of results obtained for single samples was within 0.2%. The assay's within-run and between-run precision is excellent (coefficient of variation less than 1%). The assay provides data on the percentage of reticulocytes in whole blood with an accuracy and precision that is at least 20 times greater than conventional microscopic technics.\r"

Thirty minutes after ingestion of ethanol, WB-PIA was significantly inhibited when compared with baseline values. There was no significant inhibition when the same volunteers ingested water instead of ethanol. These observations suggest that WB-PIA is a sensitive technic for the detection of the effect of ethanol on platelets. These findings also support the view that blood ethanol levels achievable during social drinking impair platelet function, thus possibly accounting, at least in part, for the reported \"protection\" from ischemic heart disease in moderate drinkers. The sensitivity of human platelets to the inhibitory effect of ethanol suggests that continued drinking will adversely influence the incidence of initial bleeds and of rebleeding in gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with alcoholism.\r"

MRI scans were positive for MS in 48 of 51 clinically definite MS cases and in 4 of 4 not-definite MS cases. MRI scans were negative for MS in five of six cases that were not MS. These findings demonstrate that combined determinations of serum and CSF proteins by simple zone electrophoresis and commercial immunochemical tests can be useful laboratory aids in the diagnosis of MS. The MRI scans provide additional evidence to support the diagnosis of MS.\r"

The patient presented with hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal pain, and fasting chylomicronemia. A Western diet elicited a steep increase in plasma triglyceride concentration and the appearance of floating chylomicrons over a clear infranatant in fasting plasma. Postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity was moderately reduced to 38% of control values. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity was 10% of normal, whereas his muscle enzyme activity was within the reference range. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of plasma apolipoproteins revealed the presence of normal activator (apolipoprotein C-II). These results confirm the importance of the adipose tissue enzyme for the clearance of diet-derived plasma triglycerides.\r"

Transfusions may result in either serious or troublesome complications. Although the risk of transfusion-associated acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is of paramount concern in the patient population, it has been virtually eliminated because of testing of donor units for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. Serious and troublesome adverse effects of blood transfusion are listed and ranked in order of approximate frequency. About 20% of all transfusions result in some type of adverse effect. The major serious risk of blood transfusion today continues to be transfusion-associated viral hepatitis. This entity is usually subclinical but frequently results in serious chronic liver disease. Transfusions should be avoided unless patient care would be compromised if withheld.\r"

Very young maternal age is probably a marker for one or more other maternal risk factors known to adversely affect neonatal outcome. Current studies do not provide adequate data to determine which risk factors account for the less-than-optimal outcome of the neonates of very young adolescents. Risk conditions that are potentially treatable include poor nutrition, substance use, and genital infections.\r"

Unsupplemented breast milk, limited exposure to sunlight, and darkly pigmented skin were predisposing factors. Because of this occurrence, we conducted a survey of vitamin supplementation practices among pediatricians in San Diego. Twenty-nine percent of 160 respondents do not prescribe vitamin D supplements for breast-fed infants. Those in practice less than ten years were even less likely to prescribe a vitamin supplement compared with their older colleagues. The patient report, coupled with a literature review, suggest the need for vitamin D supplementation for all nursing infants.\r"

Unfortunately, direct-reacting and indirect-reacting fractions do not correspond precisely with conjugated and unconjugated pigment. Advances in analytical methods allow accurate quantitation of the individual fractions of bilirubin in serum. Three cases of hyperbilirubinemia are presented in which bilirubin fractionation by diazo methods suggested an erroneous diagnosis. Analysis of the serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography for bilirubin conjugates confirmed the correct clinical diagnosis. Diazo methods for bilirubin analysis are subject to marked discrepancies. While the new methodology utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography is not practical for routine bilirubin analysis, optimization of diazo methods utilizing rigid and meticulous protocol is suggested. Laboratories performing diazo bilirubin determinations should correlate their results with those of other laboratories and clinical data. Clinicians need to be aware of the reliability of a particular test result before embarking on a lengthy and expensive evaluation.\r"

We found that these adverse responses may be prevented by using lactose, instead of sucrose or dextrimaltose, in soy formula. We studied 40 infants diagnosed as soy intolerant. They were given soy formula with differing carbohydrate contents in a randomized, blinded prospective study. Stool output, stool sodium content, and symptoms were significantly improved in infants receiving a soy-lactose formula; no difference was seen in formulas with sucrose or maltose. Improvement occurred in three to five days in most infants. Furthermore, the characteristic frequency distribution of the favorable response to lactose suggested a specific mechanism for the inhibition of water and electrolyte losses through the bowel. The results indicate that, in the absence of lactose intolerance, a soy-lactose formula could be useful in treating chronic diarrhea and secondary protein intolerance.\r"

Although uncommon, this disorder should be suspected in infants with a maternal history of autoimmune thyroid disease, multiple siblings with congenital hypothyroidism, or a clinical course characterized by continually suppressed TSH levels, despite low doses of levothyroxine sodium replacement. Measurement of TSH-blocking antibodies may be used in the diagnosis of transient neonatal hypothyroidism at birth and is becoming more readily available from reference laboratories. Once diagnosed, the patient may then be prepared for monitored withdrawal of levothyroxine replacement therapy at 2 to 3 years of age and will not be committed to lifelong replacement therapy.\r"

We found that the triiodothyronine level took significantly longer than the thyroxine (T4) level to return to normal. Thus, based on the T4 level alone, treatment may have been stopped prematurely in some patients, causing the relapse rate to be falsely high. The response to therapy did not depend on the size of the goiter nor on the initial levels of T4 or triiodothyronine. Six patients had adverse reactions, which were serious in two patients.\r"

In one child, there was only a suspicion of general allergy. The undiluted MMR prick test gave negative reactions in 126 cases (93%). The highest rate of nonreactivity was observed in those with atopic eczema (96%) and in children with asthma (91%) or cow's-milk allergy (82%). All examinees with systemic reactions after other vaccinations also had negative prick-test reactions. A total of 122 (95%) of the 129 examinees were eventually vaccinated with MMR. No untoward reactions developed, except mild generalized urticaria or fever in two vaccinees. We conclude that at least 95% of children with common forms of systemic allergy can be vaccinated safely with MMR and, in general, that allergic diseases should not interfere with execution of the vaccination programs.\r"

During March in 1973 through 1981, 4.3% of all live births (1368) were meconium stained. After the newborn's death, which initiated a period of legal negotiations, the incidence of meconium staining increased to 14.4% among 582 live births during March of 1982 through 1985. Laryngoscopy increased to include 64.3% of meconium-stained newborns, and endotracheal suctioning was associated with laryngoscopy in 72.2% of the patients. Also, oxygen administration to newborns with and without meconium staining increased from 10.5% in March of 1973 through 1981 to 45.7% in March of 1982 through 1985. There was no improvement in outcome from the increased recognition and more aggressive management. While the issuance of medical guidelines alone had little effect on the incidence and care of the meconium-stained newborn, the combination of the legal imperative with medical guidelines had a profound and corruptive effect.\r"

Whole-body copper 64 uptake, nine hours after intubation, ranged from 14% to 31% of the dose given for the different cereal combinations. The resultant bioavailability of copper from human milk-cereal combinations (23% to 26%) was significantly lower than that from human milk alone (38%). Whole-body zinc 65 uptake, nine hours after intubation, ranged from 13% to 54% of the dose given for the different cereal combinations. These values were significantly lower than the whole-body zinc 65 uptake from milk alone (61%). Zinc availability was lower (13% to 25%) from dry cereal combinations that contained phytic acid (oatmeal and high-protein varieties) compared with the ready-to-serve cereal-fruit combinations (24% to 54%). The highest zinc uptake (37% to 54%) was from rice-fruit combinations that do not contain phytic acid. We estimated the amounts of zinc and copper that would be absorbed from these cereal products and speculated on the potential impact of these foods on the weaning infant's zinc and copper nutriture. Depending on the feeding practices employed during the weaning period, it is apparent that infant cereals may compromise utilization of zinc and copper from milk diets during weaning.\r"

Review of the 54 previously described cases indicates that postaxial polydactyly and hydrometrocolpos in female patients are the hallmark features of this entity. Other manifestations, such as malformations of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and ophthalmic structures, occur less consistently. Affected children require careful medical follow-up. Recurrence of hydrometrocolpos following surgical repair may lead to serious sequelae, such as chronic renal failure. We believe that MKS is a distinct panethnic genetic entity, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, and that the diagnosis should be made only in female patients with hydrometrocolpos and polydactyly or in male patients with polydactyly who have an affected female relative.\r"

Vessels used included 110 radial arteries (69.6%), 27 posterior tibial arteries (17.1%), and 21 temporal arteries (13.3%). There were only two major complications (1.27%), both related to infections. The technique is described in detail. In our experience, with appropriate precaution, peripheral arterial cannulation has been a safe and reliable alternative to umbilical arterial catheterization.\r"

Of the 15 infants (78.9%) with such EEG findings, nine infants (47% of the total population) had cerebral infarction documented by cranial sonograms, computed tomographic scans, or autopsy findings. In eight (89%) of the nine infants with infarction, electrical seizures were noted during periods of muscle paralysis. We recommend (1) the use of electroencephalography in this population, particularly during periods of muscle paralysis, to detect underlying cerebrovascular lesions and (2) the use of cranial computed tomography if persistent, focal EEG abnormalities are noted.\r"

Families giving apnea monitoring or Broviac catheter care as a single treatment scored 100% in all three areas. However, the scores for care givers providing gastrostomy care (54%, 100%, and 91%), tracheostomy care (80%, 70%, and 50%), or total parenteral nutrition (88%, 50%, and 100%) as single treatments were lower. Care givers providing multiple home-care treatments had the lowest scores (65%, 65%, and 76%). However, care givers of patients who were subsequently readmitted scored well (80%, 85%, and 85%), and none of the readmissions were due to a failure of home-care management. Telephone assessment 48 hours after discharge can be used to document home-care and discharge-planning outcomes for high-risk infants and toddlers.\r"

In addition, the availability of distribution curves in children based on repeated observations, and using phase V of Korotkoff sound for the diastolic blood pressures, would be particularly helpful during the transition period from childhood to adolescence. Prospective studies in children in areas of relatively stable population and from the different parts of the world will promote our understanding of pediatric hypertension.\r"

The evidence that suggests that this unusual syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion includes the following: (1) seven of the patients have come from the relatively isolated towns of San Sebastian and Aguadilla in Puerto Rico; (2) two sets of affected siblings have been described, and, in both cases, the siblings' parents were normal; and (3) one of the children described herein is the product of a consanguineous mating. Although the pathogenetic mechanism is unknown, Setleis syndrome is clearly inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\r"

When observed in interaction with the infants, the mothers showed fewer behaviors in comparison with the controls. Three months later the mothers appeared to be interacting normally with their infants, but they expressed feelings of unhappiness that persisted until the infants reached 9 months of age. The birth of an albino infant seems to cause a delay in maternal attachment and a sadness similar to that described in connection with the birth of an infant with other congenital disorders.\r"

One hundred twenty children underwent radionuclide milk scanning for three different clinical indications, namely, respiratory tract symptoms (n = 56), gastroesophageal (GO) reflux (n = 20), and near-miss sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (n = 44). Ninety-eight (82%) of the 120 patients had a GO reflux demonstrated on the radionuclide milk scan. The incidence of aspiration was high in the respiratory (23%) and near-miss SIDS groups (20%) but low in the GO reflux group (5%). Only four of the 19 patients with an aspiration-positive scan had an aspiration-positive barium swallow film. The clinical symptoms and signs of those patients with aspiration-positive results were not significantly different from those of patients in whom aspiration was not demonstrated. We conclude that radionuclide milk scanning is more sensitive than barium swallow roentgenography in detecting aspiration; however, the clinical significance of such aspiration is undetermined. In view of the high incidence of GO reflux demonstrated in the absence of aspiration by the use of radionuclide milk scanning, the sole finding of GO reflux in a child with respiratory tract symptoms should not be taken as presumptive evidence that aspiration is contributing to those symptoms.\r"

In both normals and patients, amplitude and duration of contractions were more at 5 cm than at 10 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. The patients differed significantly from normals not only in amplitude at 5 cm, but also at 10 cm and in duration at both sites. Bipeaked waves were seen more frequently in patients than in normals at either 5 or 10 cm above the sphincter. Two patients, but none of the normal subjects, had triple-peaked waves. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure was significantly elevated in patients as compared to normals. Although percent relaxation of the sphincter was the same in patients and normals, the postrelaxation residual, or nadir, sphincter pressure was higher in patients. We conclude that patients with high-amplitude peristaltic contractions may also have abnormalities in duration of contractions, percent bipeaked waves, triple-peaked waves, or in parameters of the lower esophageal sphincter.\r"

Motility parameters measured included lower esophageal sphincter pressure, amplitude, velocity, and duration of esophageal contractions. Unlike most previously reported prostaglandin E2 infusion studies, our study demonstrated that oral trimoprostil at low or high doses, when compared with placebo, had no effect on lower esophageal sphincter pressure or distal esophageal peristaltic amplitude in response to wet swallows. Therefore, oral administration of methylated prostaglandin E2 analogs would not be expected to contribute to esophageal reflux.\r"

  ".W": "Due to conflicting reports in the literature regarding the efficacy of sulfasalazine for Crohn's disease (CD) involving small bowel alone, we reviewed the treatment results of our systematic sulfasalazine treatment in CD over a 23-yr period. We identified 28 patients with CD of small bowel alone treated between 1 and 23 yr by means of sulfasalazine alone and who went into complete clinical remission. Of these, 12 also showed total regression of radiographic abnormalities, 12 showed partial regression, while four patients still await radiographic reexamination. While our data do not permit a precise estimate, it seems that about 25% of patients with small bowel CD respond to sulfasalazine alone. Reasons are discussed why our data are at variance with some and in accord with other reports. While our study of necessity could not be carried out in double-blind fashion, patients served as their own controls, having previously failed to respond to other treatment modalities or no treatment. We conclude that sulfasalazine should be tried in the treatment of CD of small bowel because of its relatively low toxicity and reasonably high efficacy.\r"

The incidence rate in the total population in 1981-85 was 5.8 per 10(5) population per yr. In European and American born subjects the incidence rate was twice as high as in Asian and African born and Israeli born subjects. The mean age of onset of ulcerative colitis was significantly lower in Israeli born persons (26.8 yr) than in the other population groups; when the total population was stratified by age, this difference was shown to be caused by the relative youthfulness of the Israeli born subpopulation. Despite these striking epidemiological differences, clinical features were similar in the three population groups.\r"

One-hundred seven (84%) of the 128 patients with diarrhea lasting at least 1 month were found to be HIV seropositive. HIV seropositive patients with persistent diarrhea more often had a generalized papular pruritic eruption (p = 0.02), a genital herpes simplex infection (p = 0.05), a history of herpes zoster (p = 0.08), and infection with cryptosporidia (p = 0.006) than HIV seronegative patients with persistent diarrhea. Bacterial enteric pathogens were found in 5 (7%) of the 76 seropositive and in none of the 14 seronegative patients in whom stool cultures were performed. Presently persistent diarrhea in adults in central Africa is strongly associated with HIV infection, but the pathophysiological mechanisms causing this diarrhea remain unclear.\r"

The correct categorization of a patient's disease is essential to avoid \"stage migration.\" Class III lupus nephritis (focal, segmental) should be divided into mild, moderate, and severe. The amount of prednisone administered was calculated, and it was found that the severity of the renal lesion was of greater prognostic significance than the choice of treatment given. While a classification that includes consideration of chronicity appears useful, this study indicates that the amount of acute inflammatory change in the glomeruli is also an important prognostic indicator.\r"

The ultrastructural abnormality is secondary to a more basic defect in the chemical structure of the glomerular basement membrane. Clues to chemical abnormalities have come from immunochemical studies, which suggest a lack of or alteration in that part of the noncollagenous portion of type 4 collagen related to Goodpasture antigen. Variability in the results of immunochemical studies suggest biochemical heterogeneity that still needs to be correlated with the known evidence of genetic heterogeneity in Alport's syndrome.\r"

Urine volume ranged from 0.91 to 4.51 L/d. Various components of urine that might affect urine output, ie, osmolar excretion, sodium excretion, urea nitrogen excretion, free water clearance, and potassium excretion, were correlated with urine volume to determine their relative effects. Total osmolar excretion correlated highly with urine output (r = .92, P less than .001), while correlation with free water clearance was weak. Of the three osmotic components, total urea nitrogen excretion correlated best with urine volume (r = .86, P less than .001), while the correlation with sodium excretion was less pronounced (r = .75, P less than .001). The relatively greater impact of urea excretion on urine volume was confirmed by multiple regression analysis. However, total cation excretion (sodium plus potassium) gave nearly as good a regression with urine volume (r = .83, P less than .001). Our findings confirm that total osmolar excretion is a major determinant of urine volume in chronic renal failure and suggest that urea excretion may play the most important role in determining output.\r"

In addition, five (7%) biopsies showed global proliferative LN in less than 80% of glomeruli and mesangial LN in the others. We assessed the renal status of these five patients at the time of renal biopsy and at outcome following prednisone treatment, with or without azathioprine. Four patients improved and later had either a normal urinalysis or only trace proteinuria. A low chronicity index was calculated on the biopsies of these patients. The fifth patient, whose condition did not improve, demonstrated a high chronicity index on renal biopsy. Overall, the renal status at outcome in the patients showing mixed mesangial and global proliferative LN more closely resembled that of patients with mesangial than diffuse global proliferative LN.\r"

  ".W": "To obtain information about predialysis characteristics and long-term outcome of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for more than 4 years, we reviewed all patients starting PD who performed continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and were at risk for more than 4 years. Sixty-two patients started; 42% were diabetic and 35% over age 60. Three recovered renal function, seven received transplants, and 12 switched to hemodialysis. Nineteen survived more than 4 years (long-term survivors, LTS), eight diabetic and 12 male. Twenty-one died on CAPD in less than 4 years (short-term survivors, STS). In comparison to STS, LTS were younger, with less prior cardiac disease, yet had higher predialysis serum creatinine values and lower hematocrits. LTS were observed for a mean of 65.3 +/- 3 months (48 to 91 months), and STS for a mean of 21 +/- 2 months. When compared to STS, LTS had fewer hospital days, hospital days for peritonitis, and a lower peritonitis rate, although the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis was greater in LTS. Cardiovascular and thromboembolic events were less frequent in LTS, but bone fractures were seen more often in the LTS diabetic patients. Weight gain, especially in males, and hernias were noted in both groups. BP improved, and vision was maintained in both groups. Non-PD-related infections causing hospitalization were low in both groups. Improved mean hematocrit and hemoglobin A, values were seen only in LTS. Mean serum cholesterol values increased with time in LTS. This study reveals that potentially high-risk patients such as diabetics and the elderly can have prolonged survival on PD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have considered the following hypotheses: (1) both diseases are caused by a common allele; (2) different alleles at the same locus predispose to the two diseases; (3) one disease is predisposed by two alleles, one of which can also lead to the second disease; and (4) different HLA-linked loci are involved in the etiology of each disease. For each hypothesis, we have derived the expected HLA haplotype-sharing distribution in sib pairs who are affected with two diseases. The comparison of the expectations indicate that, in many cases, the alternate hypotheses can be distinguished, if the sample size is appropriately large. The knowledge of the mode of inheritance of each disease is not usually necessary; however, it can greatly increase the power of the test. Analyses of data on pairwise combinations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD), and insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) suggest that (a) IDDM is predisposed by two HLA-linked alleles, one of which also predisposes to ATD, (b) one of the IDDM alleles also confers susceptibility to RA, and (c) although the HLA-linked susceptibilities to RA and ATD appear to be primarily due to distinct alleles, the ATD allele may also have a minor role in predisposition to RA.\r"

  ".W": "The alphoid DNA family is composed of tandemly repeated sequences whose organization is chromosome specific. Under stringent conditions of hybridization, subsets of these sequences localize specifically to the centromeric region of a given chromosome. The alphoid clone, 308 (D6Z1), is a 3-kb BamHI DNA fragment that is repeated at the centromere of chromosome 6. Sequences homologous to 308 are organized as 2-kb BamHI repeats on X. We used 308 to screen a 2-kb BamHI genomic library and obtained the cloned homologue, XC, which hybridizes, in situ, to the centromere of X. These probes provide a means of analyzing the centromeric region on two different human chromosomes. The complete nucleotide sequence of 308 shows that it is composed of 20 variant 173-bp repeats. The organization of the 173-bp monomers is not a repetitious but a symmetric pattern, and an inversion is present. The chromosome specificity of 308 to chromosome 6 is determined by the entire 3-kb sequence and not by an amplified 173-bp monomer, because the divergence among the 173-bp units on chromosome 6 is as great as that between monomers on chromosomes 6 and X. Therefore, the organization of monomers is specific for a chromosome, and the monomers themselves are not specific. Analysis of the sequence data from these two alphoid sequences and other published sequences shows that some chromosomes have sequences that are more homologous than others. These subsets of alphoid sequences reflect the latters' chromosomal distribution and evolution. By using probes 308 and XC, we found that alphoid repeats from specific chromosomes are similar in that there is no evidence for their transcription in lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, and we demonstrated the possibility that all of these sequences are late replicating.\r"

  ".U": "87323230\r", 
  ".W": "Leprechaunism is an inherited disorder characterized by insulin resistance and intrauterine growth restriction. In this study we analyze insulin binding and subunit structure of the insulin receptor in dermal fibroblasts cultured from three unrelated families whose probands (Ark-1, Atl, and Minn) were affected by leprechaunism. Cells cultured from all three probands had markedly reduced insulin binding at equilibrium. Fibroblasts cultured from the parents of Ark-1 and Atl had partial and differing degrees of impairment in insulin binding. The structure of the alpha subunit of insulin receptors was analyzed by cross-linking 125I-insulin to plasma membranes. A major band of 350 kilodaltons (kD) (corresponding to the heterotetrameric insulin receptor alpha 2 beta 2) was observed in control and leprechaun fibroblasts. The relative amount of radioactivity cross-linked to plasma membranes reflected the genetic variations seen in insulin binding to intact cells. In reducing gels, 125I-insulin was cross-linked equally to a 250-kD (alpha-alpha dimer) and a 125-kD (alpha monomer) protein in cells from controls, the parents of Ark-1 and Atl, and probands Atl and Minn. By contrast, cells from the Ark-1 proband had diminished cross-linking of alpha-alpha dimers. The ratio of dimer to monomer in cells from controls was 0.93 +/- 0.06, and that in cells from Ark-1 was 0.31 +/- 0.19 (P less than .01). Beta-subunit structure and function was analyzed by studying insulin-enhanced autophosphorylation. Although maximal stimulation of beta-subunit phosphorylation was reduced to 30% in proband Ark-1 fibroblasts, this reduction was quantitatively related to reduced insulin binding. These results indicate that mutations causing severe insulin resistance and defective insulin binding are transmitted with autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance and that heterogeneity exists for these mutations. The mutation in pedigree Ark-1 most likely produces conformational changes in alpha-subunit interaction.\r"

Isoelectric focusing-immunoblotting studies of ORM revealed the presence of isoprotein species that did not segregate with the predominant alleles at the ORM locus and suggested the expression of a second structural gene locus for orosomucoid (ORM2). Genetically independent variation consistent with expression of the ORM2 locus was observed in plasma samples from American blacks but was not observed in U.S. whites or sampled populations of North- and South-American Indians, Eskimos, Aleuts, or New Guinea Highlanders. The population allele frequencies for this locus were .958, .025, .006, and .011 for alleles ORM*1, ORM2*2, ORM2*3, and ORM2*4, respectively.

Skin fibroblasts of the patient converted only about half of the core protein of the small proteodermatan sulfate to a mature glycosaminoglycan chain-bearing proteoglycan. The remaining core protein, which contained complex-type asparagine-bound oligosaccharides, was secreted with almost normal kinetics. Xylosyltransferase activity and the synthesis of other proteoglycan types were normal. Normal induction of glycosaminoglycan synthesis occurred in the presence of 1 mM, but there was very little induction in the presence of 0.01 mM p-nitrophenyl-beta-xyloside. An antibody against an N-terminal pentadecapeptide of the core protein recognized the glycosaminoglycan-free core protein from the patient less well than the chain-bearing protein treated with chondroitin ABC lyase. Though these results do not define the basic defect unambiguously, they provide the first report of a disorder being due to an abnormality in small proteoglycan biosynthesis.\r"

Mortality was increased at all ages, with an overall SMR of 2.27 (95% confidence interval 1.7-3.0). Sudden death accounted for the excess deaths in those less than 4 years of age, and brain-stem compression was identified as the cause in half of these deaths. Central nervous system and respiratory causes were not significantly increased but accounted for half of the deaths in those 5-24 years of age. SMRs were not significantly increased for those greater than 34 years of age. However, deaths attributed to cardiovascular causes were increased in the 25-54-year-old age group, accounting for 10 of 17 deaths. The overall cardiovascular SMR was 5.2 (95% confidence interval 2.5-9.6). Within this group, severe disability resulting from marked spinal canal stenosis was present in a majority of individuals and may have been a contributing factor in these deaths. This study suggests that the bony abnormalities associated with achondroplasia--i.e., foramen magnum and spinal canal stenosis--may have a significant effect on mortality at all ages but particularly in children. Efforts to minimize these complications are recommended.\r"

  ".W": "At least two spontaneous abortions were karyotyped in 273 women during cytogenetic surveys in New York City and Honolulu. These pairs were analyzed using maximum-likelihood logistic-regression analysis to adjust for maternal age and location. There was a significantly increased risk for a chromosomally normal spontaneous abortion after a previous abortion with a normal karyotype. There was no increased risk for trisomy in a second spontaneous abortion following either a previous trisomic abortion or an abortion with another abnormal karyotype. This is unexpected, given the increased risk for trisomy found among live births and at prenatal diagnosis in young women with a previous trisomic birth. The most likely explanation is that the increased recurrence risk for trisomy is restricted to trisomy for only one or a few chromosomes, for reasons such as parental trisomy mosaicism. These data predict no increased risk of chromosome abnormality in future pregnancies after either (1) spontaneous abortions with trisomies of a kind that are always lethal in utero or (2) multiple early abortions in the presence of normal parental karyotypes.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that advanced paternal age (independent of maternal age) is associated with an increased incidence of trisomy. However, studies of human liveborn offspring and of data from prenatal diagnosis have yielded conflicting results. To investigate this possible paternal age effect, we have studied sperm chromosome complements from 30 normal men of proven fertility stratified by age, with five males in each of six age categories (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, and 45+ years). Sperm chromosome complements were visualized after penetration of golden-hamster oocytes. A minimum of 30 complements were analyzed for each male. The analysis was performed blindly, without knowledge of the donor's age. The mean frequency of sperm chromosomal abnormalities in the individual men was 10.4% with means of 4.7% for numerical abnormalities and 6.2% for structural abnormalities. There was no relationship between age and the frequency of numerical abnormalities in sperm. Since there was a significant difference between the frequency of hyperhaploid and hypohaploid complements, these two types of numerical abnormalities were analyzed separately. There was no correlation between the frequency of hypohaploid complements and age. There was a significant negative correlation between age and the frequency of hyperhaploid complements. For structural abnormalities, there was a highly significant positive correlation with age. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis of an increased risk of trisomy with paternal age.\r"

During a 3 1/2-year period the chromosome laboratory of Rigshospitalet has tested the Magiscan chromosome system under routine conditions and performed the first evaluation of its clinical performance. The system consists of an image processor with a light pen for manual interaction connected to a hard-copy printer and a microscope with a TV camera and a motorized scanning stage for eight slides. Automated metaphase finding takes place without operator assistance. An operator is involved in the analysis after the metaphases are located. Using two of these complete systems, we have performed a total of 4,691 chromosome analyses comprising a count of 10 metaphases, of which three were \"eyeball\" karyotyped and one was \"machine\" karyotyped. Presently, two-thirds of our prenatal analyses (amniotic-cell cultures) are carried out with these two machines. A third Magiscan system without scanning stage is used as a \"karyotyping-only\" system to produce hard-copy karyograms in those cases in which metaphases are manually located and counted in the microscope. Since the end of 1984, 4,773 additional machine karyograms have been produced with this system. With a complete system, a prenatal analysis can be carried out in an average of 35 min. The average time for a machine karyotype is 7 min. Since 1984 the productivity of the laboratory has increased 17%-20% without enlarging the staff.\r"

Urokinase and streptokinase are the two most frequently used thrombolytic agents. Both dissolve thrombi by converting circulating plasminogen, an inert precursor, into plasmin. One possible advantage of urokinase and streptokinase over new clot-specific agents is that the former have systemic fibrinolytic effects. This reduces blood viscosity and prevents other thrombi from forming. Angiography is the most objective technique for assessing reestablished arterial patency, but being invasive, it present disadvantages. Noninvasive criteria for coronary reperfusion include lowering of elevated ST-segments, shifting creatine kinase isoenzyme MB curves, and the appearance of reperfusion arrhythmias. Techniques for assessing myocardial salvage include thallium uptake, assessment of wall motion and myocardial thickening, ejection fraction, and positron emission tomography to assess infarct size. The role and appropriate timing of coronary artery repair after thrombolytic therapy are being studied.\r"

  ".W": "Regional left ventricular wall motion, about two to three weeks after acute myocardial infarction (MI), is perhaps the best clinical measure of myocardial salvage and limitation of infarct size by thrombolytic therapy. Normal or only slightly depressed wall motion at the site of infarction indicates significant limitation of infarct size, whereas markedly abnormal wall motion indicates irreversible myocardial damage. Early studies found significant improvement in regional wall motion in only 40 percent of patients undergoing successful intracoronary thrombolytic therapy after the onset of symptoms of acute MI. Why only 40 percent of these reperfused patients demonstrated salvage of ischemic myocardium could not be answered at that time. Animal experiments show that the duration of coronary occlusion is an important factor in determining myocardial salvage after reperfusion. To study whether this time dependency also exists under clinical circumstances in patients with coronary artery disease, the relationship between regional wall motion (as an index of infarct size) and the time to thrombolytic therapy after the onset of symptoms (as an index of duration of coronary occlusion) was examined. After showing that such time dependency does indeed exist in patients with acute MI, the efficacy and safety of intravenous bolus injections of urokinase were then demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Clinicians and researchers often have different perspectives: Clinicians deal with patients as individuals; researchers deal with them as members of groups whose characteristics can be defined statistically. Clinicians should be cautious and skeptical about new therapies, therefore, because the applicability of group-successful treatment to individual subjects is not always appropriate. In deciding whether to use the new thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, clinicians should consider the factors that limit as well as those that support its use. As a clinician, I ultimately favor its use because intracoronary thrombosis is almost ubiquitous in acute infarction, and thrombolytic therapy addresses this basic problem. Fortunately, acute infarction is an evolutionary process, giving us time to take action. Since the extent of necrotic myocardium determines prognosis, and reperfusion can limit infarction size, salvaging myocardium should improve the outcome. Thrombolytic therapy can usually be administered quickly, easily, and safely. It requires minimal laboratory monitoring but careful clinical monitoring. Signs of successful therapy are easily recognized clinically, as are the signs of reocclusion if it occurs. The problem of the best treatment to follow thrombolytic therapy remains unsolved. But the thrombolytic component of overall management of a patient with acute myocardial infarction is worthwhile.\r"

Urokinase was infused directly into the proximal portion of the clot at 4,000 IU/minute for two hours. Arteriography was then repeated. If a channel had been lysed in the proximal part of the clot, but the distal part remained occluded, the catheter was gently advanced into the still occluded portion of the clot and the infusion was resumed at 4,000 IU/minute until antegrade blood flow was reestablished. Then the catheter was repositioned to be proximal to all of the remaining clot. The urokinase dosage was reduced to 1,000 IU/minute and the infusion continued with reexaminations at eight-hour intervals. The infusion was continued until complete clot lysis was accomplished. A search for a flow-limiting lesion on which to perform a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was then performed. The lack of at least a 10 percent reduction in clot length after a 500,000-IU cumulative infusion dose of urokinase was an indication for termination of the regimen. Seventy-five percent of the 93 infusions resulted in complete clot lysis, even though in nine patients (10 percent) the infusion could not be completed. Eighty-one percent of the 84 completed infusions resulted in complete clot lysis, and the incidence of clinical improvement was 89 percent. The average duration of infusion was 18 hours. Major bleeding (requiring transfusion) occurred in only 4 percent of the patients. This regimen has now been applied to 150 occlusions, and the results are approximately the same. Review of our experience demonstrated that the ability to easily advance an angiographic guide wire through an occlusion has been the best predictor that a given clot would lyse irrespective of the clot's location or the duration of symptoms. Easy guide wire traversal appears to rule out the presence of either advanced changes of clot organization throughout the occlusion or a rare completely obstructing atherosclerotic lesion. A review of the published experience of 155 direct intra-thrombus infusions of 5,000 IU/hour of streptokinase demonstrated only a 45 percent incidence of complete clot lysis. Also, infusion times were quite prolonged (41 hours), and major bleeding complications were surprisingly common (13 percent). The results with urokinase thus indicate that it is preferable to streptokinase since it produces fewer complications and accomplishes more rapid recanalization and a higher incidence of total clot lysis.\r"

The interim results of this multicenter study are presented in which patients in whom euglycemia was not achieved based on fasting and two-hour postprandial plasma glucose criteria with first-generation sulfonylureas were given glipizide therapy for 24 weeks. Twenty-three percent of the patients who had only fair results with first-generation sulfonylureas (fasting plasma glucose level of more than 140 mg/dl, postprandial plasma glucose level of more than 175 mg/dl) had good to excellent results with glipizide therapy alone (fasting plasma glucose level of less than 140 mg/dl or less than 115 mg/dl, respectively). Overall, 15.4 percent of patients with fair to poor control using first-generation agents had good to excellent control using glipizide. At least a 25-mg/dl decrease in fasting plasma glucose and postprandial plasma glucose levels was also seen in 47 and 46 percent of patients given treatment with glipizide who had poor control (fasting plasma glucose level of more than 200 mg/dl, postprandial plasma glucose level of more than 235 mg/dl) with first-generation agents. Glipizide was extremely well tolerated, with no significant side effects. Preliminary data indicate that glipizide may provide a significant advantage in terms of safety and efficacy over first-generation agents.\r"

For volume of distribution, the best performance occurred with 3 or 4 levels with both methods and amounted to an error of about 15%. In conclusion, both methods of estimating vancomycin pharmacokinetics perform comparably, but the Bayesian method appears to require fewer data.\r"

Because thiol reactive agents also influence K movements in red cells and deoxygenation leads to K loss and Na gain in sickle erythrocytes, the authors investigated the possibility that deoxygenation-induced K loss could be influenced by thiol agents, independent of an effect on hemoglobin-oxygen affinity. Experiments were performed with the thiol crosslinking agent N,N'-p-phenylenedimaleimide (PMD). The authors found that PMD inhibited deoxygenation-induced K loss in sickle erythrocytes. This effect was not due to sickling inhibition as PMD-treated cells gained Na with deoxygenation, nor could the effect be explained by monofunctional PMD binding to membrane sulfhydryl groups, as a monofunctional analogue of PMD was not able to retard deoxygenation-induced K loss. These findings support a role for membrane sulfhydryl groups in deoxygenation-induced K movements in sickle red cells and suggest that this K loss may be prevented by crosslinking of certain membrane sulfhydryl groups.\r"

However, the implications for legionella contamination in a hospital without known Legionnaires' disease is unclear. Therefore, culturing for Legionella pneumophila in the environment has not been routinely recommended. The authors conducted a prospective pneumonia study in three hospitals, none of which was known to have a major problem with endemic legionellosis. The water system of Hospital 1 was colonized with L. pneumophila, serogroup 1; Hospital 2 was colonized by L. pneumophila, serogroup 5 (which is rarely associated with disease); Hospital 3 was essentially free of L. pneumophila. Sputum culture on selective legionella media, direct fluorescent antibody testing, and serology were performed for all nosocomial pneumonias regardless of clinical impression. At the end of the study the incidence of nosocomial legionnaires' disease was found to be 9%, 0%, and 0% in Hospitals 1, 2, and found to be 9%, 0%, and 0% in Hospitals 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In Hospital 1, monoclonal antibody subtyping confirmed that the patient isolates were identical to the environmental isolates. The authors conclude that environmental culturing, despite the absence of known Legionnaires' disease, is useful. Positive cultures from the hospital water supply would mandate the introduction of legionella testing into the laboratory and stimulate physicians to consider Legionnaires' disease when encountering nosocomial pneumonias.\r"

At the Medical College of Georgia, 656 patients were studied with nonstress tests used as the primary test, whereas at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, 614 patients were managed with the nipple stimulation contraction stress test used as the primary test. Both populations were comparable in regard to pregnancy complications, gestational age, birth weight, perinatal outcomes, cesarean section rates, and the incidence of positive contraction stress tests. Specificity and positive and negative predictive values were similar for both tests. The extended nonstress test had higher sensitivity but also required significantly longer mean duration of testing. The corrected perinatal mortality rate for a reactive nonstress test or negative nipple stimulation contraction stress test was zero within one week of the last test. We conclude that both tests provide excellent primary methods of fetal surveillance and that the decision to use one test rather than the other should be made on the basis of considerations of cost, convenience, time availability, and the presence of specific test contraindications or pregnancy complications.\r"

Fifty-eight patients (25%) had biopsy-proved cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Repeat Pap smears identified only 17% of these patients. Colposcopists noted atypical transformation zones in 97% of the patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervigrams identified 81% of the cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesions but had a 15% method failure (uninterpretable).

During 1985, 42.5% of all births in the region occurred in the project. During the time span examined, a downward trend was seen for rates of low birth weight births in public and private patients and for very low birth weight births in private patients. During 1985, private births in the project were significantly less likely to be low birth weight or very low birth weight than private births to women not in the project. These results suggest that regional implementation of prematurity prevention programs is feasible and that such programs are particularly appropriate for private patients.\r"

Most patients (83%) had gynecologic malignancies. Obstruction of the small intestines was more common than obstruction of the large intestines (77% versus 23%). Major causes of mechanical small bowel obstruction included extrinsic neoplasms (62%, mostly ovarian carcinomas), radiation therapy-associated strictures and adhesions (17%), postoperative adhesions (14%), and inflammatory strictures and adhesions (3%). Obstruction of the colon was caused mainly by extrinsic neoplasms (45%), strictures and adhesions associated with radiation therapy (26%), fecal impaction (9%), and intrinsic neoplasms (8%). Gastrointestinal intubation successfully relieved 81% of small bowel obstructions caused by postoperative adhesions. Tube suction alone was rarely successful when the obstruction was caused by malignant neoplasms. The prognosis was dependent on the cause of the underlying disease. The cases studied in this report were compared with a large number of cases of bowel obstruction in general surgery. It is concluded that bowel obstruction associated with gynecologic disease has unique features deserving wider recognition.\r"

Seven patients with ruptured isthmic ectopic pregnancies underwent segmental tubal resection without reanastomosis. All four patients who underwent segmental tubal resection with primary microsurgical reanastomosis had postoperative hysterosalpingograms demonstrating bilateral tubal patency. One pregnancy has occurred in this group. Nine patients underwent linear salpingostomy. In five of the six patients who had postoperative hysterosalpingography, patency of the involved fallopian tube was demonstrated. Four of these nine patients, including one patient with contralateral tubal occlusion, have conceived.

The efficacy of the fetal biophysical profile to indicate fetal acidosis was found to be superior to the 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores in sensitivity and positive predictive value. These data suggest that the biophysical profile is very accurate in the identification of the fetus with acidemia. The first manifestations of fetal acidosis are nonreactive nonstress testing and loss of fetal breathing; in advanced acidemia fetal movements and fetal tone are compromised. A new protocol of antepartum fetal evaluation is suggested based on individual biophysical components rather than the score alone.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma glucose determinations were performed 1 hour after a 50 gm oral glucose load in 30 patients receiving long-term terbutaline therapy (20 to 40 mg/day for at least 1 week) and 247 normal control patients. A total of 63% of patients receiving terbutaline had an abnormal 1-hour value (greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl), an incidence much higher than that of control subjects (17.8%) (p less than 0.0001) for a relative risk of 3.54 (95% confidence intervals of 2.29 to 5.42). Mean 1-hour values were 112.1 mg/dl for control subjects and 149.8 mg/dl in the terbutaline group (p less than 0.0001). All abnormal values were followed by a 3-hour 100 gm oral glucose tolerance test. A total of 15.9% of the glucose tolerance tests performed in the control group (2.8% overall) were abnormal as opposed to 52.6% (33.1% overall) in patients receiving terbutaline (p less than 0.01). Nine patients were studied before and after terbutaline therapy. Results obtained during administration of terbutaline were significantly higher (102.2 mg/dl before therapy versus 145.2 mg/dl during therapy). We conclude that treatment with oral terbutaline appears to be associated with impairment of glucose tolerance in pregnancy.\r"

Twenty-six patients (42%) underwent a prophylactic cerclage for a history of second-trimester loss or a hypoplastic cervix on initial clinical examination (group I). Thirty-six patients (58%) were followed expectantly (group II). Sixteen patients (44%) in group II demonstrated cervical change and required an emergency cerclage. Twenty-one patients were managed expectantly with no cerclage. The gestational age at delivery for group I was 37.7 +/- 2.80 versus 34.5 +/- 6.9 weeks for patients without a cerclage (p = 0.04). There were no perinatal deaths if a cerclage was performed, whereas there were five deaths (24%) in the group without cerclage. The five deaths occurred at a mean gestational age of 24.40 +/- 4.0 weeks and a mean birth weight of 614.00 +/- 441.73 gm. Patients with a hypoplastic cervix or prior reproductive loss had a better outcome with early cerclage than patients with a normal cervix followed expectantly. We presently lack a reliable method to detect the diethylstilbestrol-exposed patient at greatest risk for perinatal loss. Based on our experience we believe that placement of a cerclage early in pregnancy should be a strong consideration.\r"

The patients were classified into four groups according to the values of the systolic/diastolic ratios. The first group had normal ratios in both the umbilical and uterine arteries. The second group had elevated umbilical ratios and normal ratios in the uterine arteries. The third group had elevated uterine artery systolic/diastolic ratios with normal umbilical artery values, and the fourth group had elevated systolic/diastolic ratios in both vessels. Women in the group with normal ratios in both the umbilical and uterine arteries were delivered of infants with a birth weight (mean +/- SD) of 3261 +/- 522 gm and gestational age of 39 +/- 2 weeks. The values for the three groups with abnormal velocimetry were: those with elevated umbilical ratios and normal ratios in the uterine arteries: body weight = 2098 +/- 811 gm, gestational age = 35.7 +/- 3.2 weeks; those with elevated uterine artery ratios with normal umbilical artery values: 2464 +/- 722 gm, gestational age = 36.3 +/- 3 weeks; and those with elevated systolic/diastolic ratios in both vessels: body weight = 1627 +/- 697 gm, gestational age = 33.3 +/- 2.7 weeks (p less than 0.01; p less than 0.001). There were 27 small for gestational age infants delivered during this study. Doppler velocimetry studies were abnormal in 26 of them (96%). Results show that Doppler-derived vascular patterns correlate well with normal and adverse perinatal outcome. A description of the uterine and umbilical systolic/diastolic ratios should be part of the clinical evaluation of all pregnant women with hypertension. This should lead to better treatment protocols and improved clinical outcome.\r"

All mothers followed a standard study protocol and underwent overnight fasting; studies began with a 30-minute control period, followed by oral administration of 200 mg caffeine, and a 180-minute subsequent observation period with continued maternal fasting. Blood samples for glucose and caffeine were obtained every 30 minutes and continuous recording of fetal breathing and body movements were entered on a microcomputer for off-line analysis. The two groups were similar for all obstetric outcome features. Plasma glucose levels were similar and constant in both groups whereas caffeine levels increased significantly at 60 minutes after administration; mean plasma caffeine levels were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 at all intervals. Fetal breathing rates and body movement incidences were similar in both groups before and after caffeine administration. Fetal breathing movement incidence decreased significantly in group 2 but was sustained at baseline levels in group 1 throughout the study. High long-term ingestion of caffeine during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal plasma caffeine levels and fetal breathing activity when compared with low caffeine ingestion. Short-term administration of 200 mg caffeine does not appear to have a significant physiologic impact on these activities.\r"

We investigated the kinetic behavior of this enzyme in the myometrium of women who were nonpregnant, pregnant at term not in labor, and pregnant at term in active labor. Phosphodiesterase activity was measured in the 100,000 g supernatant by the two-step isotopic procedure. The Km (Michaelis constant) value remains essentially unchanged from the nonpregnant to the pregnant state and subsequent labor in both the low and the high affinity enzymes. During pregnancy the V max (maximum velocity) is 75% less than in the nonpregnant state (p less than 0.005) and remains unchanged during labor. This is true for both the high and the low affinity enzymes. These changes in the kinetic characteristics of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-phosphodiesterase are indicative of noncompetitive inhibition. We conclude that this inhibition may be interpreted as part of the mechanism for uterine smooth muscle relaxation and pregnancy maintenance.\r"

Comparison of protein binding by paired cord and maternal sera yielded a ratio of 0.99 +/- 0.13.

Characterization of metabolic control for the one abnormal oral glucose tolerance test value and the gestational diabetes mellitus groups (before treatment) showed no significant difference. After the start of treatment, however, a significant (p less than 0.01) difference between the groups in level of control was found. While no significant difference in the average birth weight between the three groups was discovered, the incidence of large infants (macrosomia and large for gestational age) was found to be significantly higher in the one abnormal oral glucose tolerance test group when compared with the normal (34% versus 9%; p less than 0.01) and gestational diabetes mellitus group (34% versus 12%; p less than 0.01). No significant difference for the incidence of an infant large for gestational age was found between the normal group and the patients with gestational diabetes mellitus after treatment.

  ".W": "Umbilical artery Doppler blood flow velocity studies were used to identify 14 fetuses with absent flow during diastole to determine the significance of absent umbilical artery diastolic flow. Outcomes of these fetuses were recorded, and the associated intracardiac Doppler changes were identified in 12 of them. Maximal and mean intracardiac flow velocities were measured, and volume flows through the right (tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve) and left (mitral valve, aortic valve) sides of the heart were compared. Ratios of intracardiac peak flow velocity in late diastole to peak flow velocity in early diastole were calculated. Eleven fetuses had intrauterine growth retardation, and four had multiple congenital anomalies. Fetuses with no diastolic flow in the umbilical artery had increased volume flow across the tricuspid and pulmonary valves compared with normal fetuses of similar weights. The ratio of right-sided to left-sided volume flow in the heart (2.15:1) was increased compared with values in normal fetuses (1.33:1, p less than 0.01). The ratio of late diastolic to early diastolic peak flow velocities across the mitral valve was decreased (p less than 0.01). Absent umbilical artery diastolic flow is associated with increased tricuspid and pulmonary valve volume flow and changes in mitral flow velocity patterns, which suggests that there are alterations in left ventricular function.\r"

Present experiments use a new type of cell-labeling technique in attempts to measure the number of M cells present in the FAE of specific pathogen-free (SPF) and normal animal house reared (AH) BALB/c mice. Results show the apparent M-cell area to increase threefold 7 days after transfer of SPF mice to an AH environment. This change takes place without significantly affecting the area of FAE occupied by goblet cells. It is suggested from these results that M-cell production can be selectively increased within the FAE through the presence of foreign antigens and that this effect could have general importance in controlling the overall GALT response to enteric infection.\r"

  ".W": "The mesothelium is a target of the toxic and carcinogenic effects of asbestos fibers. Fibers greater than 8 mu in length and less than 0.25 mu in diameter have been found to be highly tumorigenic in rodents, while shorter asbestos fibers or spherical mineral particles have not been shown to produce mesotheliomas. For investigation of early mesothelial reactions associated with the development of mesotheliomas, C57BL/6 mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 200 micrograms of short or long crocidolite asbestos fibers, toxic silica particles, or nontoxic titanium dioxide particles. At intervals between 3 hours and 21 days after a single injection, the mesothelial surface of the diaphragm was examined by stereomicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and autoradiography. Within 6 hours after injection of asbestos fibers, mesothelial cells in the lacunar regions of the diaphragm retracted opening stomata 10.7 +/- 2.3 mu in diameter leading to the submesothelial lymphatic plexus. Short asbestos fibers (90.6% less than or equal to 2 mu in length), silica, or titanium dioxide particles (less than or equal to 5 mu in diameter) were cleared through these stomata without provoking an inflammatory reaction or mesothelial injury. In contrast, long asbestos fibers (60.3% greater than or equal to 2 mu in length) were trapped at the lymphatic stomata in the lacunar regions on the peritoneal surface of the diaphragm. At these sites, an intense inflammatory reaction developed with accumulation of activated macrophages and a 5.5-fold increase in albumin recovered in the peritoneal lavage fluid after 3 days. As early as 12 hours after injection of long asbestos fibers, the adjacent mesothelial cells were unable to exclude trypan blue and lost their surface microvilli, developed blebs, and detached. Recovery of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the peritoneal lavage fluid was increased 5.8-fold after 3 days and returned to normal levels after 14 days. Regenerating mesothelial cells appeared at the periphery of asbestos fiber clusters 3 days after injection. Maximal incorporation of 3H-thymidine by mesothelial cells occurred after 7 days, followed by partial restoration of the mesothelial lining after 14-21 days. As late as 6 months after a single injection of crocidolite asbestos fibers, clusters of fibers remained in the lacunar regions, partially covered by mesothelium but surrounded by macrophages and regenerating mesothelial cells. The anatomic distribution and size of lymphatic stomata on the peritoneal surface of the diaphragm account for the selective accumulation of long asbestos fibers in these regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The activity of the Schwann cell enzyme cyclic nucleotidyl phosphohydrolase increased considerably in one condition, after induction of a predominantly flat cell phenotype. All studied NB cell lines were capable of synthesizing and expressing the extracellular matrix proteins laminin (LM), fibronectin (FN), and Type IV collagen; but a specific pattern of expression emerged after differentiation, which was proportional to normal tissue equivalents: neuronal--none; melanocytic--FN only; and Schwann cell--large amounts of FN, LM, and Type IV collagen.\r"

In this study, the authors report that a scanning electron microscopic examination of 2 cases of superficial BCEs reveals that the tumor proliferates centrifugally as a monolayer beneath the epidermis as well as over the surfaces of hair follicles, while eroding and replacing the original basal architecture. Behind the leading edge of this monolayer, the cells split away from the epidermis to form a round border resembling a carpet being rolled up. This border then develops into a mass lesion, which represents the tumor cell foci seen in routine paraffin sections. These findings have led the authors to propose a fundamentally different explanation for the pathogenesis of these tumors: BCEs are conditioned neoplasms that require contact with the epidermal or hair follicular epithelium in order to grow. This hypothesis could explain the behavior of BCEs as well as the clinical and pathologic varieties observed in clinical practice.\r"

Use of higher-energy stimuli may lengthen seizures but may also increase the risk of toxicity, and it is not possible when maximum settings are reached. The authors present the cases of six drug-free depressed inpatients whose seizure durations in ECT declined despite maximum settings on three different ECT devices. In all cases, pretreatment with caffeine lengthened seizures (mean increase = 107%), and clinical improvement followed. Caffeine was well tolerated, even in patients with cardiovascular diseases.\r"

The authors compared clinicians' recognition of the major extrapyramidal syndromes in 48 psychotic inpatients with independent blind diagnoses by clinical researchers using standardized ratings. The major finding was a high rate of clinical underrecognition of all major extrapyramidal syndromes, especially tardive dyskinesia. The authors discuss the clinical predictors of nonrecognition of extrapyramidal side effects and recommend improved training in their detection.\r"

Patients were assessed on 1) overall outcome, 2) psychotic, anxiety-neurotic, and depressive symptoms, 3) social and work functioning, and 4) rehospitalization. The delusional depressed patients showed significantly more mood-incongruent delusions at follow-up. Surprisingly, the nonpsychotic depressed patients exhibited more depressed mood and significantly more anxiety at follow-up. The findings suggest that the diagnostic distinction between delusional and nonpsychotic depression is relevant to the clinical course of major depression.\r"

Agoraphobia is a more viable label than panic disorder. Behavioral treatment consists of delineating the patient's agoraphobic avoidance and panic profile and developing a self-exposure program to produce habituation. Systematic exposure to agoraphobic situations is usually of durable efficacy, and the treatment requires little time from clinicians. Antidepressant drugs, which do not interfere with exposure, are a useful addition when dysphoria is present, but they can have troublesome side effects.\r"

Independent validation by family members and counselors was obtained for the calibration sample, and internal consistency and test-retest reliability were established. The instrument correlates well with the criteria of the revised version of DSM-III (DSM-III-R). It offers a convenient means to screen clinical populations of alcoholics and drug abusers, as well as general populations, for pathological gambling.\r"

Experiences with contract management of middle eastern hospitals in the early 1970s gave the American firms impetus to pursue ownership of health facilities in other parts of the world. US companies now operate over 95 foreign hospitals. The reasons for this involvement include the political receptivity of the government of the host nation; the potential for rapid growth and profits; the lack of indigenous competition; and the ability to occupy a distinct niche within the extant health services organization. The political and ideological implications of the growth of private medicine, particularly in the United Kingdom, in terms of its effects on the National Health Service are discussed. Questions for future research are posed.\r"

Using the California State Computer Mortality File, an algorithm was developed and a search of the death certificates was made using three factors: \"injury at work,\" injury at a work location, and pertinent external-cause-of-death codes. Only 30 per cent of the 466 homicide deaths identified were also found in the logs of the state Occupational Safety and Health agency. The average annual rate of work-related homicides was 1.5 per 100,000 workers. The male-to-female-rate ratio was 4.2:1. Police and security guards and persons in occupations having frequent public contact involving exchange of money, particularly in late afternoon or evening hours, were at highest risk. Controlling exposures of high-risk individuals and developing strict standards for reducing such exposures might greatly reduce assaults and thus prevent senseless loss of life in the workplace.\r"

Injuries from firearms caused 81 per cent of the deaths. The overall rate of workplace homicide was 2.1/100,000 male workers/year. Males employed in taxicab service had the highest rate of workplace homicide. 78.2/100,000 male workers/year. Males employed in certain retail trade industries, law enforcement, and the private-security industry also had high rates of workplace homicide. Male workers greater than or equal to 65 years old were at especially high risk, with a workplace-homicide rate 3.5 times that of younger workers. A review of medical examiners' records in five urban counties indicated that 32 per cent of victims who had worked in eating-and-drinking places and 5 per cent of other workers had blood or cerebrospinal-fluid alcohol levels greater than or equal to 0.10 g/dl. These results provide a base for designing effective strategies to prevent workplace homicides.\r"

Quitters were defined as those who had stopped smoking at least one year prior to admission. More than 80 per cent of male and female quitters had stopped more than five years prior to diagnosis. The lifetime quit rate (no. ex-smokers/no. ever smokers) X 100 was higher in males than in females, and in both sexes the quit rate increased with increasing age, education level, and occupational level. Jews had higher quit rates compared to non-Jews, and Whites had higher quit rates than Blacks. Those who were divorced or separated had lower quit rates than those who were not. In both sexes, light smokers and heavy smokers had elevated quit rates. The quit rate also increased with increasing interval between waking and smoking the first cigarette of the day. Logistic regression models were used to adjust simultaneously for the role of different variables.\r"

The states have coded their state death certificate files for industry and occupation, using the decedent's usual occupation and industry as reported on the death certificate. From these files, the SHE(O) computer program selects deaths which are likely to be work-related, based on a previously published SHE(O) list of 50 disease rubrics and associated industries and occupations. The computer program matches the SHE(O) list with the recorded industry, occupation, and underlying cause of death. The program has been tested using 1984 death certificate data from Maine, upstate New York (excluding New York City), North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Approximately 1 to 2 per cent of all deaths were selected by the program, with lung cancer and coal workers' pneumoconiosis being the most frequent cause of death. The SHE(O) program may be useful for identifying deaths which are potentially occupationally related, but its utility and its application to death certificates needs further evaluation before recommending widespread use. Limitations are discussed, as well as plans for improving the application of the SHE(O) concept to death certificates.\r"

  ".U": "87323723\r", 
  ".W": "The role of cultural assimilation in Hispanic health behavior has received little empirical examination. Prior studies have operationalized assimilation primarily in terms of language preference and have obtained weak or no effects. We interviewed 603 elderly Hispanic women residing in Los Angeles to evaluate the usefulness of cultural factors as predictors of preventive health behavior (e.g., physical examination, screening for breast cancer) more rigorously. Factor analysis of responses yielded four dimensions of cultural assimilation: \"language preference\", \"country of birth\", \"contact with homeland\", and \"attitudes about children's friends.\" After controlling for education and age, no dimension of assimilation associated strongly or consistently with health behavior. Of the four dimensions, use of English language associated most closely with increased screening, although most of the effects for language were small in magnitude. These findings, coupled with those of other studies, strongly suggest that cultural factors may have little impact on the health behavior of Hispanics. Access to and availability of services, affective reactions toward screening, and sociodemographic factors are stronger determinants of Hispanic health practices.\r"

Mean Hgb levels were higher for Whites than Blacks in both age groups. When all the dietary components (i.e., iron, zinc, copper, folacin, ascorbic acid and vitamins B12, E and B6) were considered as a group, they accounted for 8.4 per cent of the Hgb variance in 10-year-olds and 10.1 per cent of variance in 15-year-olds. However, even after controlling for the variations in dietary patterns of the adolescents and pre-adolescents, race still accounted for a notable proportion of Hgb variance in both age groups (9.1 per cent in 10-year-olds and 7.0 per cent in 15-year-olds). Within each race, gender accounted for a greater percentage of the Hgb variance in the adolescents than in the pre-adolescents. Our results indicate that in all likelihood racial differences in Hgb levels during childhood exist independent of racial differences in intake of specific \"blood building\" nutrients and maturational changes.\r"

This will ensure that filters will be placed in the infrarenal position when appropriate, thus preventing occasional inadvertent discharge, particularly into the right renal vein. Second, use of a guide wire greatly facilitates passage of the introducer and accurate intracaval positioning. Third, intraoperative technical errors must be recognized and promptly corrected. Finally, meticulous postoperative follow-up is essential, and recurrent embolism or any change in filter position requires repeat roentgenography of the vena cava to guide appropriate corrective treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Iliocaval compression syndrome is a significant disorder in a number of patients who have lower extremity venous complaints. The diagnosis may be suspected by positive findings on exercise strain gauge venous plethysmography and unilaterally increased ambulatory venous pressures. The diagnosis is confirmed by ascending and, in some instances, descending venography which demonstrates the iliocaval compression with or without intraluminal web formation. Transstenosis pressure gradients may be measured to confirm the hemodynamic significance of the lesion. We advocate direct operative repair of the iliocaval junction with rerouting of the iliac artery and excision of the iliocaval webs with cephalic vein patch angioplasty. It provided good results in the present study when coupled with an adjunctive regimen of perioperative subcutaneous heparin and warfarin. Further investigation into the exact prevalence and significance of the iliocaval compression syndrome is needed. Only an aggressive approach to patients with lower extremity venous complaints will help clarify the exact prevalence and natural history of this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Criteria for abandoning infrainguinal arterial reconstructions in favor of major amputations should include reliable predictors not only of graft patency, but more importantly, of limb salvage. To evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative outflow resistance measurements in predicting limb salvage after infrainguinal bypasses, we have reviewed 134 such operations (64 femoropopliteal and 70 femorodistal bypasses) performed for critical ischemia. Outflow resistance measurements were divided into quartiles for femoropopliteal bypasses (Group A 0.17 mm Hg/ml/min or less, Group B 0.18 to 0.24 mm Hg/ml/min, Group C 0.25 to 0.4 mm Hg/ml/min, and Group D greater than 0.4 mm Hg/ml/min) and femorodistal bypasses (Group A 0.4 mm Hg/ml/min or less, Group B 0.4 to 0.58 mm Hg/ml/min or less, Group C 0.6 to 1 mm Hg/ml/min, and Group D 1 mm Hg/ml/min or greater). One year limb salvage rates for patients who underwent femoropopliteal bypass were 95 percent, 92 percent, 87 percent, and 67 percent from the lowest to the highest quartile (difference not statistically significant), and for those who had femorodistal bypass, they were 51 percent, 75 percent, 48 percent, and 0, respectively (p less than 0.05). Interestingly, 12 month graft patency and limb salvage rates for patients who underwent femorodistal bypass with outflow resistances between 0.59 and 1 mm Hg/ml/min did not correlate well (22 percent and 48 percent, respectively), whereas for those with outflow resistance greater than 1 mm Hg/ml/min, they were 22 percent and 22 percent, respectively. Thus, measurement of intraoperative outflow resistance is a very accurate predictor of limb salvage after infrainguinal bypass operations.\r"

These benefits include inhibition of the surgical stress response, decreased cardiorespiratory depression, decreased blood loss, decreased intubation and pulmonary infection, decreased thromboembolism, decreased hyperglycemic and hypertensive response, nitrogen sparing, a stable resting metabolic rate, prevention of immunosuppression, simplification of cerebral status monitoring, and earlier ambulation and hospital discharge. The main disadvantage in patients undergoing vascular procedures is the risk of epidural hematoma. A review of the literature confirms the extreme rarity of this risk and, in view of the emerging benefits, argues for reconsideration of epidural technique in vascular patients. The addition of epidural morphine to this combined technique affords a postoperative pain-free continuum unmatched by any other method. This significantly decreased pain stress in cardiac patients increases safety and comfort. In conclusion, epidural anesthesia and postoperative epidural narcotics provide a safe and reliable method of management for patients undergoing vascular procedures.\r"

Diagnosis of vascular steal syndrome was suggested by clinical symptoms of pain and coolness of the distal part, as well as trophic changes of the hand. The diagnosis was confirmed by placing a cuffed photoplethysmograph transducer on one or more of the digits of the affected limb and recording the waveform before and during manual compression of the arterial end of the prosthesis. The findings showed essentially a flat waveform converting to pulsatile waveform when the proximal graft was compressed. Two patients underwent controlled operative banding of the arterial end of the polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis using this same method. A polytetrafluoroethylene cardiovascular patch was cut to a width of 1 cm and then cut again to form two shoelace tails each 0.5 cm in width. The band was placed around the proximal part of the prosthesis and progressively tightened until an adequate digital pulse wave returned. Preservation of flow through the prosthesis was maintained so as to allow dialysis and prevent thrombosis. The technical aspects of the procedure have been discussed. Vascular steal syndrome appears to be more common in the diabetic.\r"

In this setting, associated injury is limited, and arterial injury is uniformly suspected, deliberately sought, and expeditiously repaired. Blunt trauma and massive injuries to the soft tissue, bones, and joints of the extremities augur amputation. In a patient with blunt trauma and loss of distal pulses, liberal, early use of angiography helps to avoid amputations secondary to missed or delayed diagnosis. Deliberate local anticoagulation and effective venous drainage is recommended in the management of dual-complex popliteal injuries. Discriminate amputation merits consideration when arterial trauma is accompanied by massive soft tissue and bony injuries with extensive loss of soft tissue.\r"

Our experience with 34 patients over a 12 year period was reviewed and factors influencing outcome were analyzed. Seventeen women and 17 men had various clinical presentations, although 74 percent of the patients had the classic picture of ischemia. Preoperative assessment of left ventricular function was carried out in all but one patient with intraoperative and perioperative monitoring to guide therapy in addition to revascularization procedures. While extent of the preexisting disease and number of additional operations did influence the outcome, the predominant factor for survival was the left ventricular functional state perioperatively. Fifteen of the 16 patients with adequate left ventricular function survived, whereas 15 of the 17 patients with a failing myocardium died (88 percent). Extraanatomic operations are preferable in patients with demonstrated inadequate left ventricular function. Expeditious restoration of circulation alone does not ensure a favorable outcome. The key to successful therapy is understanding, preventing, and effectively treating the mechanical and metabolic dysfunction of the heart. Review of the literature on acute aortic thrombosis revealed only few isolated case reports except for a recent report of eight patients. Our report of 34 patients over a 12 year period represents the largest experience to date from a single institution. Detailed analysis of hemodynamic parameters and the significance of determination of left ventricular function has not been reported so far in this subset of critically ill patients.\r"

The cremaster muscle of anesthetized rats was fashioned as a single layer, splayed on a lucite chamber and suffused with bicarbonate solution at 35 degrees C. After a 1 hour period of baseline data collection, ischemia was produced by cross-clamping the cremasteric vascular pedicle for periods of 30 minutes and 2 hours in separate experiments. Macromolecular leakage was visualized after reinstitution of perfusion. Leakage occurred at postcapillary venules 15 to 50 micron in diameter and quickly spread to the interstitium. The magnitude of leakage decreased as a function of time with continuous buffer suffusion, but remained higher than in the control period. No reflow occurred in approximately 30 percent of the muscle microvasculature upon reperfusion. The no-reflow values at 30 minute and 2 hour periods of ischemia were significantly different from the control values but were not from each other. Electron micrographs demonstrated endothelial cell swelling and migration of leukocytes and normal myocytes after 1 hour of reperfusion following 2 hours of ischemia. Our results demonstrate that permeability changes, occurrence of no reflow, and leukocyte migration precede the onset of damage to skeletal muscle in ischemia and reperfusion injury.\r"

Most valves tested were competent, with the exception of those from one cadaver which were apparently congenitally incompetent. Acquired or congenital internal jugular valve incompetence may impair cerebral venous return, especially when intrathoracic pressure is increased by positive-pressure ventilation. Screening for internal jugular valve incompetence with a Doppler flowmeter before utilizing this type of mechanical ventilation may help prevent the deleterious effects of cerebral venous congestion.\r"

Results of this study indicate that survival in the younger patient is better than that in the patient over 50. Survival in the younger patient compared favorably to that in the general population through 5 years. Limb salvage rates after aortofemoral bypass and femoropopliteal bypass in both age groups were the same; however, limb salvage after femorotibial bypass in patients under 50 was not as good as in the older patient. Based on these results, the disease process in patients under 50 years of age does not appear more virulent than in those over 50 years of age. Smoking is the most significant risk factor in patients under 50 with atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease.\r"

With increasing expertise in noninvasive testing, the importance of extensive dye studies is being questioned. The data presented herein indicate that proper preangiographic evaluation of the patient population drastically reduces the possibility of missing significant intrathoracic pathologic processes. Two subsets of patients should be recommended routinely for dye studies: those patients with unequal upper-extremity blood pressures and those without pathologic neck findings on noninvasive testing to account for their symptoms. When these patients are recognized as having the potential for intrathoracic disease, dye studies can be performed in situations that will generate the highest yield. Even with the continued use of dye studies in evaluation of cerebrovascular insufficiency, elimination of the aortic arch study will drastically reduce the dye load and, thus, the associated morbidity.\r"

This has been enhanced by the emphasis in medical schools on research and the results of research, publications which are more often than not counted or weighed rather than read. Suggestions for change include (1) putting the patient first in the health care equation; (2) rewarding teaching and clinical care equally with research; (3) placing real clinicians on medical school faculties; and (4) establishing a national health service in which all medical school graduates must serve in physician-sparse areas for a period of time after graduation, preferably without a single computerized tomography scanner, magnetic resonance imaging unit, or advanced radiologic imaging device within reach.\r"

In all 52 patients, thoracoscopy averted the need for formal thoracotomy. Thoracoscopy proved valuable as (1) the ultimate diagnostic tool for determining the presence or absence of pleural malignancy in patients with recurrent pleural effusions; (2) a method for obtaining tissue in cases where cytologic study was inadequate for diagnosis; (3) a highly successful approach to chemical pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusions, multiloculated effusions, or failed tetracycline pleurodesis; (4) a means for determining whether a loculated fluid collection was intrapleural or parenchymal in location when radiologic study had failed to clarify this; (5) a way to completely drain the pleural space in patients with multiloculated empyemas not amenable to tube thoracostomy; and (6) an alternative to open lung biopsy in the immunosuppressed patient with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Thoracoscopy is a safe, effective, and relatively simple procedure which can be easily performed under regional anesthesia, even in ill or elderly patients. It is an often overlooked alternative to thoracotomy and should be used more widely.\r"

One hundred seven patients who underwent needle localized biopsy from June 1977 to September 1985 were reviewed. Eighty percent of the biopsies were benign and 20 percent were cancers (22 patients). In patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy, 80 percent of the axillary specimens were node-negative. During the same 8 year period, 570 breast cancers were diagnosed. Needle localization was responsible for only 4 percent of all cancers found. Though needle localization represents an advance in the detection of early breast cancer, the majority of cancers are found by physical examination. The importance of routine examination by a physician and self-breast examination remains paramount.\r"

Appendectomy was the most common operation preceding the obstruction. Early operation was performed in 54 cases with two deaths, and nonviable and borderline bowel was found in 30.2 percent. Continuous abdominal pain, generalized tenderness, guarding, and distension appeared to influence the attending surgeons' decisions to operate early. A trial of conservative treatment with nasogastric decompression was carried out in 267 cases with one death. Conservative treatment was successful in 126 cases, but in 140 cases, there was no improvement or the condition became worse and a delayed operation was required. There was no mortality in the delayed operation group and nonviable and borderline bowel was found in 22.8 percent of cases. The incidence of nonviable and borderline bowel did not increase with the length of delay, but was more frequent in those whose condition grew worse after conservative treatment. No preoperative factors that could reliably predict bowel strangulation were found. However, the results in this series justify a trial of conservative treatment with close observation in patients without clinical evidence of strangulation or marked abdominal distension.\r"

During this period, marked changes in anastomotic strength have been observed. A general and marked increase of collagen synthesis was found throughout the intestine already on the second day. This resulted in increased collagen content. Collagen concentration remained relatively unchanged despite an increase in collagen content as a result of concomitant increase of noncollagenous substances. The previously reported loss of anastomotic strength in the early phase of healing could not be explained by changes in collagen content or metabolism in this study. Cutting of sutures seems to be due to a local process. After 4 days, collagen content increased predominantly in the anastomotic region. It correlated well to the previously observed increase of anastomotic strength.\r"

However, in 14 of the 17 patients (80 percent), multiple surgical interventions and intensive supportive therapy failed to control the process, and they died from complications. Deaths occurred after a prolonged in-hospital course characterized by sequential failure of organ systems. If the salvage of these patients is to be optimized, as in some reports, the timing of the first surgical procedure has to be very carefully made based on the clinical and laboratory findings, and most importantly, the results of computerized tomography. Exploration is probably best carried out through an extended subcostal incision, and a determined attempt must be made to remove all of the necrotic tissue. Little reliance can be placed on the possibility that significant amounts of residual necrotic tissue can be aspirated through sump catheters or evacuated by irrigations. We believe that the poor results in this series lend strong support to those who have already advocated much more universal application of the open abdomen technique in the management of these patients with widespread anterior pararenal space necrosis.\r"

Measurements of amylase, trypsin, lipase, total protein, and DNA were obtained from the homogenated pancreatic tissue. Isolated pancreatic lobules were incubated with and without ceruletide (5 X 10(-10) g/ml) during a 60 minute period. Amylase values were determined four times in the incubation medium. Morphometry was performed by light microscopy analysis. There was a significant increase in pancreatic weight, DNA content, and trypsin concentration 2 weeks after vagotomy with and without pyloroplasty. These changes were accelerated after 4 weeks. DNA, amylase, and total protein concentrations were unchanged. Lipase concentration decreased 2 weeks after vagotomy and pyloroplasty, whereas at 4 weeks, it decreased in both experimental groups. The in vitro incubation study revealed a significantly decreased amylase discharge under basal conditions, whereas the stimulated amylase discharge was unchanged in both experimental groups compared with the control group. Morphometry did not detect differences in exocrine cellular size. We conclude that vagotomy in rats induces pancreatic hyperplasia, enzyme dissociation, and decreased basal amylase discharge in vitro.\r"

Forty-two patients underwent amputation of the toes or part of the foot, 48 underwent below-knee amputation, and 18 underwent above-knee amputation. In 24 (20.3 percent), the necrotic process advanced postoperatively and necessitated additional amputation. The average hospital stay was 33.6 days. Twenty-eight patients (23.7 percent) died during the postoperative period, and the main cause of death was sepsis. Patients who presented with extensive gangrene had a higher mortality rate. There was no correlation between mortality and the duration of conservative treatment, number of repeated operations, the treatment of diabetes before hospitalization, onset of symptoms, or status of the peripheral pulses. The solution to the problem is early and vigorous preventive treatment. This could be accomplished through highly specialized clinics within the community.\r"

  ".W": "Static and dynamic forces exerted on 6-0 polypropylene suture material after carotid arteriotomy were measured in 22 adult mongrel dogs. Force was measured in 11 normotensive animals (Group I) before and 6 weeks after carotid artery repair. Force was measured in the remaining animals during normotension and induced hypertension before and 6 weeks after operation. The tensile strength of each suture used in the study was measured by the manufacturer. The mean force required to break a 6-0 polypropylene suture measured 436.9 +/- 2 g, whereas knotting of the suture decreased the tensile strength to 316.9 +/- 3.9 g (p less than 0.001). The static and dynamic axial forces exerted on the suture after carotid arteriotomy in Group I was in the range of 26 g and decreased to 18 g at 6 weeks, whereas the 45 degree force exerted during the static dynamic phase measured in the range of 23 g and decreased to 16 g at 6 weeks (not statistically significant). The axial and 45 degree forces exerted on 6-0 polypropylene suture material in Group II under normotensive conditions were in the range of 14 g after carotid arteriotomy and ranged between 12 to 14 g at 6 weeks. Systolic hypertension did not result in a significant increase in axial or 45 degree forces during static or dynamic measurements, both in the range of 15 g after carotid arteriotomy. Measurements were similar at 6 weeks and ranged between 14 and 16 g. Our data indicate that 6-0 polypropylene suture material is an appropriate choice for repair of the carotid artery and that the suture material has sufficient inherent tensile strength to withstand forces generated in the neck region. Furthermore, our data indicate that spontaneous carotid artery suture line disruption is most likely related to damage to the suture strand during carotid artery repair rather than an inherent weakness in the suture material.\r"

This position of the balloon enables a safe reconstruction of the internal ring without injury to the epigastric vessels and prevents tightening of the cord. This technique was successfully employed on 75 adult patients who underwent repair of an indirect inguinal hernia without complications.\r"

Small intestinal transit time was measured by the appearance of radioactivity in the caecum and also of hydrogen in end tidal air. Gastric emptying was prolonged over placebo by nalbuphine 10 mg, which had more effect than nalbuphine 5 mg or morphine 5 mg; morphine 5 mg had less effect than nalbuphine 5 mg. Small intestinal transit time was prolonged over placebo by nalbuphine 10 mg more than by nalbuphine 5 mg or morphine 5 mg, which had approximately equal effects.

The mean difference between peak airway pressure calculated by the computer and directly measured peak intratracheal pressure was 0.02 kPa (SD 0.10) in 18 infants and children. The mean difference between ventilator breathing system pressure and intratracheal pressure in the same group was 0.82 kPa (SD 0.91). Bench tests established that the decrease in peak pressure displayed by the ventilator (from 1.36 to 0.38 kPa) while inspiratory time was increased from 20 to 80% of the respiratory period, concealed an increase (from 0.2 to 0.38 kPa) in intratracheal pressure which occurs during this process; and that the large increase in pressure displayed by the ventilator (from 0.3 to 6 kPa) while respiratory frequency was increased from 20 to 120 breaths/minute, concealed a small increase in peak intratracheal pressure (0.2-0.3 kPa) which occurs during this process. These changes were accurately predicted by the computer program. The increase in intratracheal pressure associated with prolonged inspiratory times explains the high incidence of barotrauma which has recently been associated with this procedure in infants.\r"

Twenty-four patients had experience of a patient-controlled analgesia apparatus which incorporated a sophisticated feedback of buzzer tones and a speech synthesizer. Of those who expressed a preference, fifteen preferred the speech synthesizer and only one preferred the buzzer tones. The speech synthesizer is a reliable, inexpensive and simple method of supplying feedback to patients when such apparatus is used.\r"

Osmotic fragility was determined by the degree of hemolysis in buffered saline solutions of decreasing osmotic strength. Halothane-induced fragility was determined in an isotonic solution containing increasing percentages of halothane saturated solution. The effects of six different incubation conditions prior to performing fragility tests were examined in an attempt to optimize discrimination of MH susceptible patients, including the following: 1) no preincubation; 2) 24-hr incubation at 4 degrees C; 3) 72-hr incubation at 4 degrees C; 4) 24-hr incubation at 37 degrees C; 5) 24-hr incubation at 22 degrees C with plasma from an MH-susceptible patient; and 6) 24-hr incubation at 22 degrees C with plasma from a normal patient. Despite examining six different incubating conditions and the two methods of hemolysis induction, no differences in erythrocyte fragility were detected between patients diagnosed as MH susceptible or normal. Erythrocyte fragility testing is not useful for diagnosing MH susceptibility.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of afferent nerves in the area of surgery is a cause for surgical pain and stress. Intravenous (IV) lidocaine has been shown to inhibit postoperative pain. In the present double-blind study, the effects of a continuous IV infusion of lidocaine (2 mg/min) on the sympathoadrenal stress response to surgery were evaluated in 38 patients scheduled for elective cholecystectomy who were randomly assigned to two groups. In one group, lidocaine infusion was started 30 min before the operation and continued for 24 hr after surgery (n = 18). In the second group (n = 20), saline was infused. The increases in heart rate and blood pressure after tracheal intubation were not significantly different between the groups, but tachycardia and hypertension associated with extubation was prevented in patients given lidocaine. Differences in blood pressure and heart rate between the two groups were otherwise not significant intra- or postoperatively, nor were differences in blood glucose or plasma catecholamine concentrations during the first 24 hr after skin incision. Urinary catecholamine concentrations did not differ significantly in the two groups during the first postoperative day, but during the second postoperative day urinary output of epinephrine and norepinephrine were significantly less in the group of patients receiving lidocaine infusion. It was concluded that the IV infusion of lidocaine during and after major abdominal surgery suppresses extubation-induced hypertension and tachycardia but does not inhibit the general sympathetic response during the first postoperative day. However, lidocaine infusion reduces urinary output of catecholamines during the second postoperative day, suggesting a more rapid decline in the sympathoadrenal response postoperatively in the experimental group.\r"
