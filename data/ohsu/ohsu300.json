  ".W": "Ten anesthetized dogs were studied in an attempt to provoke partial alterations in atrioventricular (AV) conduction by high-frequency current (HFC) transcatheter ablation. A discharge power (10 to 15 W) was used for less than 5 seconds after reaching complete AV block (CAVB). The catheter was placed within an area having an A/V ratio = 1 with His bundle deflection. If following discharge, no appreciable lengthening an AH, AV nodal block cycle length (Wenckebach point, WP), and/or functional nodal refractory period (FRPAVN) was observed, the procedure was repeated. Four dogs (group I) were killed immediately, and the other six (group II) after 2 to 4 weeks. The AH interval, WP, and FRPAVN were found to prolong significantly following HFC, without variations in HV interval. In group II, two dogs progressed to CAVB, whereas the other four maintained 1:1 AV conduction with AH, WP, and FRPAVN greater than before the power discharge. In conclusion, HFC is an efficient technique to induce partial alterations in AV conduction, since the discharge can be adjusted and the ablation can be localized to specific regions.\r"

  ".W": "The acute and chronic cellular electrophysiologic actions of ketanserin, a selective blocker of 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT2) receptor, were examined in the isolated rabbit ventricular muscle. This work was prompted by the recent observations that small numbers of patients treated with hypertension develop QTc prolongation, rarely associated with torsades de pointes. At 1.0 Hz stimulation, ketanserin, 10(-5) and 10(-4) M, prolonged the action potential duration (APD) (by 20% and 29%, respectively) and voltage-dependent refractoriness. At 10(-4) M, the maximal rate of rise of phase 0 of the action potential (Vmax) decreased 11%. Action potential amplitude and resting membrane potential were not affected by either concentration of ketanserin used (10(-6) to 10(-4) M). Trains of stimuli at rates of 1.0 Hz or higher led to an exponential decline in Vmax to a new plateau level. The time constant for the recovery of Vmax from the use-dependent block was 1.3 second. Chronic administration of ketanserin (40 mg/kg/day, intramuscularly) caused a significant prolongation of APD (106%; p less than 0.01) and voltage-dependent refractoriness without effects on the action potential amplitude, resting membrane potential, and Vmax. These data indicate that ketanserin exerts significant class I effects with mild class III effects when superfused acutely, whereas chronic administration of ketanserin exhibits marked class III effects. Both effects of the drug are likely to exert significant antiarrhythmic actions.\r"

Four-week-old male C3H/He mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10(5.5) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCD50) in 0.1 ml of coxsackievirus B3 (Nancy strain). Interferon alpha-A/D, 10(4) U/gm/day, was administered subcutaneously daily, starting 1 day before (group 1) or on the day of (group 2) infection. Animals were killed on day 7. The infectivity of myocardial virus was significantly lower in group 1 (0.7 +/- 0.1 log10TCD50/mg, p less than 0.005) and in group 2 (2.5 +/- 1.2 log10TCD50/mg, p less than 0.005) than in control mice (4.4 +/- 0.9 log10TCD50/mg). Results of histologic examination showed extensive myocardial necrosis and cellular infiltration in all mice in the untreated group, but significantly less severe necrosis and infiltration in the treated groups. Thus, interferon alpha-A/D, when given before and simultaneously with virus, effectively inhibited replication of myocardial virus and reduced the inflammatory response and myocardial damage in an experimental model of viral myocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the acute effects of nisoldipine, a new second-generation calcium channel-blocking drug, on cardiac hemodynamics and left ventricular (LV) contractility in 10 patients with grade 2 to 4 cardiac failure. Pressures were measured from an arterial line and a flow-guided catheter in the pulmonary artery, cardiac output by thermodilution, and LV ejection fraction simultaneously by radionuclide ventriculography. Ventricular loading conditions were altered by sublingual nitroglycerin to facilitate construction of LV end-systolic pressure (radial stress)-volume and stress-shortening curves. Nisoldipine, given by continuous intravenous infusion (0.12 micrograms/kg/min), reduced mean arterial pressure (p = 0.001), systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.05), and the double product, a measurement of myocardial oxygen demand (p less than 0.01). Cardiac index, stroke index, and LV ejection fraction increased in 8 of the 10 patients. LV contractility was initially greatly reduced and was unchanged or slightly decreased during the administration of nisoldipine. Emax, the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume curve, was unaltered in half of the patients and decreased in the others (NS), whereas the end-systolic stress-shortening curve did not change. In summary, nisoldipine has a potentially useful acute hemodynamic profile in patients with cardiac failure; it increases forward blood flow in most patients, decreases the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand, and produces little measurable changes in the inotropic state of the left ventricle.\r"

In normal subjects, ventricular contractility appears to be preserved following administration of beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). The inotropic state of the ventricle was assessed in seven subjects with congestive heart failure (mean ejection fraction = 23 +/- 5%) before and after administration of the ISA beta blocker, pindolol, with the use of the noninvasively derived end-systolic pressure/end-systolic dimension (ESP/ESD) relation. The mean slope of the ESP/ESD relation was 36.3 +/- 20.4 mm Hg/cm at baseline and increased to 45.0 +/- 25.2 mm Hg/cm following five consecutive 10 mg oral doses of pindolol (p = ns). Other simultaneously derived inotropic indices that included percent fractional shortening, mean delta P/delta T, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, and preejection period-to-left ventricular ejection time ratio showed directionally similar changes toward a mild increase in contractility. These results indicate that the slope of the left ventricular ESP/ESD relation is not altered following repeated dosing with pindolol in subjects with congestive heart failure. This reflects a preservation of inotropic state following administration of this ISA beta blocker in a population with severely compromised ventricular function.\r"

The purposes of this study were to: (1) determine the inducibility of pulsus alternans in a series of patients referred for routine cardiac catheterization and (2) define the clinical and hemodynamic characteristics of those who develop pulsus alternans. In 104 patients referred for right and left heart catheterization, atrial premature beats and rapid atrial pacing were used to try to provoke pulsus alternans. The 29 patients who developed pulsus alternans in response to these maneuvers were older (63 +/- 6 vs 59 +/- 10 years, p less than 0.01) and had a greater incidence of valvular heart disease (45% vs 23%, p less than 0.01) and congestive heart failure (38% vs 17%, p less than 0.05). Aortic stenosis was the most prevalent valve lesion found. Those who developed pulsus alternans in response to pacing were further characterized by higher left ventricular systolic (143 +/- 42 vs 121 +/- 23 mm Hg, p less than 0.02) and end-diastolic pressures (17 +/- 9 vs 13 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure (35 +/- 14 vs 29 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.04), and lower left ventricular ejection fractions (0.42 +/- 0.13 vs 0.53 +/- 0.14, p less than 0.001). Eight patients (28%) with inducible pulsus alternans had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (greater than 0.50) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (less than 13 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study assessed left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in three patients after two-stage anatomic repair. Two patients had a ventricular septal defect (one with coarctation), and the third patient had right ventricular dysfunction precluding atrial repair. All had pulmonary artery banding. The mean ages at the time of repair and catheterization were 2.75 and 4.9 years, respectively. The control group included 10 patients with insignificant or no cardiac disease. At cardiac catheterization the group with TGA had a higher mean end-diastolic volume index (110.9 +/- 4.74 ml/m2) compared to normal subjects (79.1 +/- 14.55; p less than 0.001), mean end-systolic volume index (37.3 +/- 3.69 vs 22.7 +/- 4.42; p less than 0.001), mass index (101.0 +/- 16.9 vs 68.2 +/- 12.34; p = 0.038), and stroke volume index (73.6 +/- 3.52 vs 56.5 +/- 12.1; p = 0.0027). The ejection fractions, end-diastolic and peak systolic pressures, and stresses were not different. There was no difference in the relationship between the mean rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and end-systolic stress for the group with TGA, but myocardial stiffness was markedly elevated (29.5 +/- 1.84 vs 10.8 +/- 2.20; p less than 0.001). Thus, this study found abnormalities of left ventricular size after two-stage anatomic repair of TGA in this group of patients with TGA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixteen patients had coronary artery aneurysms and three had dilated coronary arteries as assessed by initial two-dimensional (2D) echo and/or angiocardiographic studies. ECG findings of first and second-degree heart block and ST-T wave changes (36%) as well as M-mode echo abnormalities (45%) including pericardial effusion, decreased ventricular septal motion, and decreased left ventricular function were all normalized by 6 months, except in two infants who continued to have decreased function and flat ventricular septal motion. In four patients with single proximal coronary aneurysm and two with dilated coronary artery, resolution of lesions occurred by 1 year. Among 11 patients with multiple coronary aneurysms discovered by initial studies, the 2D echo became normal in seven and showed aneurysms in four as corroborated by angiogram. One patient with an isolated distal coronary aneurysm, not seen by initial or serial echo, had a normal follow-up angiogram. Our study suggests that in Kawasaki disease careful, serial, 2D echo is sufficient to monitor the course of coronary artery disease that tends to regress and follow a benign course. However, the long-term effects of this disease on cardiac and coronary arteries remain to be elucidated.\r"

Echophonocardiographic (M-mode and 2D) studies were performed with analysis of LA dimensions, dynamics, and mitral valve excursion at the time of M1 and MOS. LA area and length, mitral annular diameter, and mitral dome area (from anulus plane to fused valve tip) and length were measured at M1 and MOS. Significant dynamic increases in mitral dome area and length occurred from M1 to MOS, with less striking but consistent increases in LA area, LA length, and mitral annular diameter. Conversely, mitral dome area and length decreased significantly from MOS to M1, with less striking but consistent decreases in LA area, LA length, and mitral annular diameter. Frame-by-frame video tape analysis showed that dome movement was separate from anulus motion. Mitral dome descent into the left ventricle terminated at MOS and reversal of dome motion terminated at M1. The conformational and dimensional changes that terminated abruptly at MOS reversed and terminated abruptly in a reciprocal manner at the time of the delayed, accentuated M1. When considered in light of known hemodynamic, pressure pulse, and imaging correlates in mitral stenosis, these observations strengthen the hypothesis that the mechanisms involved in the production of M1 and MOS in mitral stenosis are paired or reciprocal in nature, and the delayed, accentuated M1 and the MOS of mitral stenosis are reciprocal cardiovascular sounds.\r"

Forty-one patients, aged 7 days to 20 years, underwent pulmonary valvuloplasty over a 3 1/2-year period ending in April, 1987. Balloon valvuloplasty resulted in immediate reduction in the pulmonary valvar pressure gradient from 92 +/- 45 to 30 +/- 22 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Follow-up (3 to 34 months) clinical, ECG, and echo Doppler data were available in 35 patients. Follow-up (6 to 34 months) cardiac catheterization data were available in 29 of the 35 patients. Short ejection systolic murmurs were heard in all 35, but an early diastolic decrescendo murmur was heard in only 12 patients. Based on the catheterization and Doppler data, the patients were divided into two groups: group I (30 patients) with excellent results and group II (five patients) with poor results (gradients greater than 50 mm Hg). In group I ECG right ventricular hypertrophy regressed. The echocardiographic right ventricular end-diastolic dimension (21 +/- 6 vs 15.9 +/- 4.6 mm) decreased (p less than 0.001) while the left ventricular dimension increased (p less than 0.02). Peak Doppler flow velocity in the main pulmonary artery fell from 4.0 +/- 0.8 m/sec to 2.3 +/- 0.5 m/sec (p less than 0.001). Doppler evidence for pulmonary insufficiency was present in 21 patients.

A No. 11 French guiding balloon catheter (balloon diameter 50 French) was introduced through either the right jugular vein or the right femoral vein into the right heart, and then a fiberscope (4.3 French in diameter) was introduced through the catheter into the right heart in 10 dogs. The balloon was inflated with air and gently pushed against the luminal surface, warm saline was infused through the catheter to displace the blood, and the luminal surfaces were photographed on 16 mm color cinefilms. Pulmonary angioscopy was also performed in these dogs. Similarly, the guiding catheter and fiberscope were introduced through the right common carotid artery into the left ventricle for observation of the luminal changes in the other 10 dogs. The luminal surfaces of the superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery could be observed in all dogs. The trabeculae of the left ventricle, contracting and relaxing synchronously with the cardiac beat, could also be observed in all dogs. However, observations of the tricuspid valve, aortic valve, papillary muscle, and chordae were successful in only some dogs. Postmortem examinations revealed no obvious endocardial or intimal damage. The results indicate the applicability and safety of angioscopy guided by a balloon catheter for observations of the luminal changes in the cardiac chambers and great vessels.\r"

  ".W": "The left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is known to be an independent predictor of late prognosis after acute myocardial infarction. Despite a previous report that early heart failure (evidenced only by advanced pulmonary rales in the hospital) can predict prognosis in the absence of severe depression of the LVEF at hospital discharge, the potentially strong influence of various measures of in-hospital heart failure on the predictive ability of LVEF has not been generally appreciated. Accordingly, in 972 patients with acute myocardial infarction the effect on late mortality of the presence or absence in-hospital of both clinical and radiographic signs of LV failure in subgroups of patients with normal, moderately or severely depressed LVEF was examined and measured close to hospital discharge. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to LVEF: group I LVEF less than or equal to 40, n = 265; group II LVEF 0.41 to 0.50, n = 241 and group III LVEF greater than or equal to 0.51, n = 466. When clinical signs of LV failure were present at any time during the coronary care unit period, the 1-year mortality rate after hospital discharge in groups I, II and III was 26, 19 and 8%, compared with 12% (p less than 0.01), 6% (p less than 0.01) and 3% (p less than 0.02), respectively, when signs of LV failure were absent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a series of consecutive patients admitted between 1974 and 1976 with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 2 hourly CK estimations were performed. Complete CK curves were obtained in 102 patients, all of whom have been followed for 10 years. Without reference to their clinical course or follow-up, patients were divided into those with CK curves peaking less than or equal to 15 hours (mean 11 hours; n = 41) and those with curves peaking greater than 15 hours (mean 21 hours; n = 61). There were no differences in age, Norris index, location of AMI or past history of coronary artery disease between the groups; however, the mean peak CK was higher in the late peak group (p less than 0.05) and there were more non-Q-wave infarcts in the early peak group (p less than 0.01). In the first 9 months of follow-up there were fewer cardiac deaths in the early peak group (5 vs 13%), but this difference was not significant, and at 12 months the survival curves crossed. At 10 years, survival was 42% in the early peak group and 65% in the late peak group (p less than 0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that early peaking of the CK curve was an independent marker for cardiac death overall (relative risk 2.3, p less than 0.02). In 1-year survivors the relative risk increased to 3.8 (p less than 0.008).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

New late potentials were recorded in patients with no prior acute myocardial infarction as early as 3 hours after the onset of chest pain and as late as 8 days. Late potentials appeared transiently in only 3 patients. The detection of late potentials in the initial signal-averaged ECG identified patients with clinically significant early ventricular arrhythmias with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 72%. The predictive accuracy was 38% for a positive test and 94% for a negative test. Patients with early ventricular arrhythmias had significantly lower voltage in the terminal 40 ms of the filtered QRS complex (16 +/- 8 vs 32 +/- 19 microV, p less than 0.01) than those without arrhythmias.

Reinstitution of medical therapy was required in 6 patients (4 in group 1 and 2 in group 2). Ambulatory monitoring was initiated for 36 hours on 3 occasions: before withdrawal, and again 2 and 5 days after withdrawal. The first 2 monitorings were performed in the hospital and the last during daily activity. In group 1, the frequency of total ischemia increased by 64 and 148% from monitoring occasions 1 to 2 and 1 to 3, respectively (p less than 0.01), and silent ischemia increased by 100 and 129%, respectively (p less than 0.01). However, no significant change in transient myocardial ischemia was noted in group 2. Heart rate at onset of ischemia increased significantly in group 1 (p less than 0.01), in contrast to group 2 which had significant increases only in out-of-hospital values (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that a rebound increase in ischemic activity (mainly silent) occurs after abrupt withdrawal of beta-receptor blockade in patients with chronic stable angina. This increase in ischemic activity may be caused by increased myocardial oxygen demand.\r"

Two years later, the number and complexity of cases have increased significantly. In the present study, the experience of 3 physicians (group 1) who performed greater than 100 PTCAs (143 +/- 35, mean +/- standard deviation) was compared with that of 14 physicians (group 2) who performed less than 100 PTCAs (25 +/- 16) during a recent 12-month period. Group 1 and group 2 performed 430 and 351 PTCAs, with a 91 and 84% success rate, respectively (p less than 0.01). Group 1 and group 2 attempted dilatation of 595 and 444 narrowings with an 85 and 81% success rate, respectively (p less than 0.025). The differences reflect outcomes with \"complex lesions,\" with which group 1 had a higher success rate than group 2 (81 vs 69%, p less than 0.05) and a lower complication rate (3.1 vs 7.5%, difference not significant). Outcomes with \"simple lesions\" were similar for the 2 groups (93 vs 90%). As a result, the conclusions of the previous study should be modified. The present data suggest that while low frequency operators can perform PTCA of \"simple lesions\" with quite satisfactory results in the setting of an institution in which large numbers of PTCAs are performed and in which an expert team is available for support, outcomes with \"complex lesions\" are likely to be better in more experienced hands.\r"

To evaluate the reproducibility of such ST-segment patterns over time, these changes were analyzed in patients grouped according to the time between occlusion and reocclusion. For the patients in group 1, the study required comparing their \"fingerprints\" in repeat balloon inflation during PTCA (reocclusion in less than 1 hour), for those in group 2, comparing ST \"fingerprints\" during PTCA with ST changes during spontaneous early myocardial infarction (reocclusion in 24 hours) and in group 3, comparing ST \"fingerprints\" with ST changes during repeat PTCA for restenosis greater than 1 month after the initial PTCA. The ST \"fingerprints\" among the 20 patients in group 1 were identical in 14 cases (70%) and clearly related in another 4 (20%). Of the 23 patients in group 2, 12 (52%) had the same and 8 (35%) had related patterns. Of 19 patients in group 3, 8 (42% had the same pattern and 8 (42%) had related patterns. Thus, ST fingerprints were the same or clearly related with reocclusion in the same patient from less than 1 hour to greater than 1 month after initial occlusion in 87% of patients overall, in 90% in less than 1 hour, in 87% in less than 24 hours and in 84% greater than 1 month later.

PTCA failed in 14 patients (20%); 8 underwent emergency coronary artery bypass for acute occlusion and 4 of 6 patients whose lesions could not be crossed had elective bypass surgery. There was 1 operative death. No patient sustained a Q-wave infarction. Three patients had non-Q-wave infarctions after technically successful PTCAs. Mean follow-up was 27 months (6 to 67 months). Of the 56 patients successfully dilated, 14 (25%) had 15 cardiac events during follow-up: death (1), non-Q-wave infarction (2), repeat PTCA (7), coronary bypass (4) and recurrence of severe angina (1). The cumulative mortality was 3% and the reinfarction rate was 7% (no Q-wave reinfarctions). Forty-two (60%) of the 70 patients were free of complicating events acutely and during follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The extent score was defined as the number of 5 to 75% stenosed segments in a 15-segment coding system. The extent score was higher in subgroups of patients with new onset angina at the time of the first angiogram (4.3 +/- 2.4 vs 3.3 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.01), unstable angina at the time of the second angiogram (4.0 +/- 2.0 vs 3.3 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.05) or multifocal progression from the first to the second angiogram (4.0 +/- 2.1 vs 3.3 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.01), suggesting that it is an index of active coronary artery disease. The extent score did not correlate with the number of diseased vessels (r = 0.03), the ejection fraction (r = 0.03), the Friesinger score (r = 0.04) and the Gensini score (r = -0.07) (difference not significant for each). Cox's model was fit to the survival data recorded on a prospective basis after the second angiogram. Independent predictors of survival were ejection fraction (p less than 0.001), extent score (p = 0.001), number of diseased vessels (p = 0.01) and percent of left main luminal stenosis (p less than 0.05). The extent score was also an independent predictor of myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Thus, the extent score, an index of active progressive disease, is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of cardiac conduction defects on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) and on its ability to noninvasively identify patients predisposed to ventricular tachycardia (VT), standard 12-lead ECGs and signal-averaged ECGs were obtained in 213 patients with normal conduction and 186 patients with various conduction defects. Sustained VT was induced by programmed stimulation or occurred spontaneously in 122 patients. Two-way analysis of variance showed that conduction defects and VT were associated with changes in 3 signal-averaged ECG parameters: duration of the filtered QRS, duration of the terminal QRS under 40 microV and the mean amplitude of the terminal 40 ms of the QRS. Stepwise multiple logistic regression identified 3 variables that distinguished the patient with VT with a sensitivity of 62%, a specificity of 63% and a positive predictive accuracy of 63%. These 3 variables, listed in order of importance, were conduction defect score, duration of the filtered QRS and mean amplitude of the terminal 40 ms of the QRS. These data indicate that conduction defects have systematic effects on signal-averaged ECG parameters independent of those seen in patients predisposed to VT. These effects mandate the adjustment of the definitions of late potentials in the presence of conduction defects.\r"

The patients were divided into 3 groups based on the results of programmed electrical stimulation: group 1, 22 patients with induced sustained monomorphic VT; group 2, 14 patients with induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) and group 3, 69 patients with no induced sustained VT/VF. Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40, history of syncope/presyncope and abnormal signal-averaged ECG were significantly more common in group 1 than in group 3. No significant difference was found between groups 2 and 3. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the signal-averaged ECG for the induction of sustained monomorphic VT were 64, 89 and 84%, respectively. Using stepwise discriminant function analysis, the signal-averaged ECG was found to be the single most accurate screening test to predict the inducibility of sustained VT in patients with nonsustained VT and its value was independent of the etiology of heart disease and the length of spontaneous runs. Because of the very high specificity and negative predictive accuracy, patients with normal signal-averaged ECGs may not require invasive evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Four electrocardiographic criteria for ventricular tachycardia (VT) were proposed and evaluated. These included (1) an R wave in V1 or V2 of greater than 30-ms duration; (2) any Q wave in V6; (3) a duration of greater than 60 ms from the onset of the QRS to the nadir of the S wave in V1 or V2 and (4) notching on the downstroke of the S wave in V1 or V2. The data showed that all 4 criteria had high predictive accuracy (96 to 100%) and specificity (94 to 100%). The relatively low sensitivities of the 4 criteria alone (30 to 64%) might limit their efficacy. Grouped criteria, however, could differentiate VT from supraventricular tachycardias with high sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy. The amount of tracings having either electrocardiographic criteria (1) or (2) or (3) or (4) was determined. The proposed combined criteria had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 89% and a predictive accuracy of 96%. Left axis deviation alone was of no value in distinguishing VT from supraventricular tachycardia. Characteristic patterns were present for left bundle branch block pattern VT associated with anterior and inferior myocardial infarction. In conclusion, the 12-lead electrocardiogram alone, when systematically analyzed, can be used to accurately diagnose the origin of wide complex tachycardias with left bundle branch block pattern. Attention to these criteria may lead to more rapid and effective therapy.\r"

MAP recordings were made in continuous fashion from the right ventricle in 16 patients, before and after the intravenous administration of procainamide (11 patients) or quinidine (5). Increases in the MAP duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD90) were used as indexes of drug effect and related to plasma drug level. Surface electrocardiographic (QRS duration, corrected QT interval [QTC]) and electrophysiologic (ventricular effective refractory period) measurements, in addition to MAPD90, were made at the same time as blood sampling for plasma drug level determination. Dose response curves, plotting change in MAPD90 versus plasma drug level, showed strong linear correlation for both procainamide (p less than 0.0001) and quinidine (p less than 0.0001). The variance (error of estimation) of the predictive relation, change in MAPD90 versus plasma drug level, was significantly lower than that of change in QTC (p less than 0.001), QRS duration (p less than 0.0001) or ventricular effective refractory period (p less than 0.0001) versus plasma drug level for both procainamide and quinidine. Changes in MAP duration closely correlate with plasma drug level, and as such, may serve as an immediate, quantitative indicator of myocardial drug effect during the administration of antiarrhythmic agents.\r"

The study population comprised 38 men (37 +/- 10 years) (standard deviation) and 25 women (33 +/- 9 years) with mild essential hypertension (mean blood pressure 147/90 and 147/93 mm Hg, respectively). Body mass index was slightly higher in men (25 +/- 3 kg/m2) than in women (23 +/- 2 kg/m2). Both groups received an intravenous infusion with epinephrine of 15 and 30 ng/kg/min for 8 minutes each. Despite the similar doses of epinephrine infused in both groups, the increase of venous plasma epinephrine in men was nearly twice that in women (1.04 +/- 0.09 vs 0.67 +/- 0.09 nmol/liter, p less than 0.01), suggesting that women cleared the infused epinephrine more efficiently than men. At the highest infusion dose, the increase of systolic blood pressure was larger in men than in women (5.3 +/- 1.2 vs 1.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Conversely, the decrease of diastolic blood pressure was also larger in men than in women (-8.8 +/- 1.0 vs -5.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). The heart rate increased to the same extent in both groups (11.5 +/- 0.8 and 13.7 +/- 1.2 beats/min). If the blood pressure responses were corrected for the increase of plasma epinephrine, the difference between men and women disappeared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis of heart rate (HR) variability is a noninvasive means of investigating the autonomic control of the heart. The variability of HR and respiratory signals, both derived from ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings, were analyzed with power spectral analysis to evaluate autonomic control in 25 patients with chronic stable CHF (class III or IV) and 21 normal control subjects. In the patients with CHF, HR spectral power was markedly reduced (p less than 0.0001) at all frequencies examined (0.01 to 1.0 Hz, period 1 to 100 seconds) and virtually absent at frequencies greater than 0.04 Hz. Heart rate fluctuations at very low frequencies (0.01 to 0.04 Hz) less effectively differentiated CHF patients from control subjects, due to discrete (about 65 seconds, 0.015 Hz) oscillation in HR, which was associated with a similar pattern in respiratory activity in many of the patients with CHF. These findings demonstrate a marked derangement of HR modulation in patients with severe CHF. The frequency characteristics of HR fluctuations in these patients are consistent with abnormal baroreflex responsiveness to physiologic stimuli, and suggest that there is diminished vagal, but relatively preserved sympathetic, modulation of HR.\r"

Nineteen patients had impaired LV function as defined by NYHA/WHO and a Na,K-pump concentration of 331 +/- 19 pmol/g wet weight, whereas 5 patients had normal LV function and a Na,K-pump concentration of 559 +/- 62 pmol/g wet weight (p less than 0.001). The correlation between Na,K-pump concentration and ejection fraction was highly significant n = 24, r = 0.81, p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between volume fraction of collagen tissue and Na,K-pump concentration in the biopsies (n = 24, r = -0.08, p less than 0.80), indicating that the decrease in Na,K-pump concentration with dilated cardiomyopathy is not the simple outcome of increased fibrosis in the myocardium. The results indicate that the decrease in Na,K-pump concentration may be of importance for myocardial dysfunction and suggest a simple biochemical assessment of dilated cardiomyopathy by measurement of 3H-ouabain binding.\r"

Right ventricular dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation are important determinants of late morbidity and mortality. The value of noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of cardiac function and anatomy 9 to 20 years after this procedure has been investigated, and compared with findings on echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography and angiography in 17 adult patients. Ejection fractions measured by MRI were higher compared with radionuclide ventriculography. The correlation for the left ventricle was closer (r = 0.75) than for the right ventricle (r = 0.49). Tricuspid regurgitation was assessed by Doppler echocardiography and by MRI using the right/left ventricular stroke volume ratio. The mean stroke volume ratio in those with Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation was 1.6:1 compared to 1.1:1 in those without, and this difference reached significance (p less than 0.01). The anatomy of the great arteries was clearly visible in all patients. Five patients had a residual ventricular septal defect which, with the exception of 1 small defect, was easily visualized. The intraatrial baffle was best seen in transverse slices, and the systemic venous connection showed as a relatively narrow channel lying in the posterior part of the cavity. In general, baffle anatomy was easier to assess on 2-dimensional echocardiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was hypothesized that abnormal metabolism of bioactive eicosanoids could result from or contribute to these events. Circulating plasma thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E were measured by double antibody radioimmunoassay in patients with Kawasaki disease before and after aspirin alone or aspirin and intravenous gamma globulin therapy. Plasma prostaglandin E concentrations were normal in all patient groups. Pretreatment thromboxane B2 was elevated compared with age-matched controls, fell moderately with high-dose aspirin (60 to 100 mg/kg/day) and marginally increased with low-dose aspirin (3 to 5 mg/kg/day) 6 to 8 weeks after treatment. Plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was not detected in 12 of 16 patients before therapy and remained low in all but 1 patients by 6 to 8 weeks. Thromboxane B2 correlated weakly with serum salicylate concentration but had no relation to platelet mass. The results in these patients with Kawasaki disease indicate only partial thromboxane suppression and depressed prostacyclin generation regardless of therapy. This balance favors coronary vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation capable of potentiating myocardial ischemia or infarction. The results justify consideration of higher or more frequent aspirin doses for longer duration and thromboxane receptor blockade in this disease.\r"

Animals given soluble polysaccharides had plasma EG levels significantly higher than animals given insoluble cellulose, but only those fed the most viscous gums showed evidence of increased mucosal cell proliferation in the distal ileum. It was concluded that viscous nonfermentable polysaccharide gums stimulate the release of EG in the rat by slowing the absorption of nutrient, whereas the nonviscous polysaccharide gum arabic, or its breakdown products, probably directly stimulate mucosal endocrine cells. The failure of gum arabic to stimulate CCPR despite increased plasma EG indicated that EG alone is not a sufficient stimulus for increased mucosal cell proliferation.\r"

RBP appeared to increase more in the supplemented group but did not reach statistical significance. We hypothesize that the increase in plasma retinol levels noted in the preterm infants receiving Zn supplementation may be mediated by an increased production of RBP in the liver that in turn enhances the hepatic release of retinol.\r"

Liver-wedge biopsies were obtained from adult rhesus monkeys fed for 15 mo, either a control (100 micrograms Zn/g) or a marginally Zn deficient diet (4 micrograms/g; ZD). Liver Zn and MT concentrations were lower in ZD monkeys than in controls whereas iron concentration was higher in ZD monkeys than in controls. Liver copper, manganese, and magnesium concentrations and activities of CuZnSOD and MnSOD were similar in the two groups. Data from the groups were pooled for regression analysis. Measurement of liver Zn and MT concentrations are useful in the assessment of the effects of long-term Zn deprivation in primates.\r"

Mean plasma Zn levels were 38% lower in ZD group than in controls when evaluations began. During rapid growth plasma Zn decreased in controls but not ZD animals. ZD animals had delayed onset of accelerated weight gain and linear growth; loss of subcutaneous fat typical of early adolescence did not occur. ZD monkeys required two to three times more trials for both learning and reversal a visual discrimination task. Immune function was depressed 20-30% as reflected in early reduced proliferative response of peripheral lymphocytes and later lower immunoglobulin levels. Marginal dietary Zn deprivation affects growth and function in adolescence without producing frank developmental retardation.\r"

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were tested for relationships with absolute intakes and calorie-adjusted intakes of each nutrient after adjustment for potential confounders. Diastolic pressure in boys was negatively related to energy intake and to calorie-adjusted fiber intake. Mean adjusted diastolic pressure in boys in the top fiber-intake quartile was 2.5 mm Hg lower than that in the bottom fiber-intake quartile. Systolic pressure in girls was negatively related to calorie-adjusted intakes of protein and cholesterol.

Food balance sheets and USDA household survey data were used for corroborative purposes. Dietary data were analyzed to observe trends in the per capita consumption of calories and fat; to determine the contribution of major food groups to both calories and fat; and to determine the effect of substitutions within those food groups on consumption of calories and fat. Dietary substitutions towards less-saturated fatty acids support the hypothesized relationship between dietary fat and CHD. These changes preceded CHD mortality changes by 10-20 y.\r"

The men ate (mean +/- SD) 2570 +/- 514 kcal/d: 15.6 +/- 2.6% from protein, 40.7 +/- 5.7% from fat, 37.5 +/- 6.9% from carbohydrate, and 6.2 +/- 6.0% from alcohol. Percent body fat correlated positively (p less than 0.05) with g/1000 kcal intake of total, saturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids and negatively with carbohydrates and plant protein. Total calories, number of meals, and distribution of calories were unrelated to percent body fat, total weight, or fat-free mass. The higher proportion of fat and carbohydrate in the diet may contribute to obesity in men. The modest caloric intake of these men and the lack of correlation between percent body fat and total calories suggest that calorie differences are not the major cause of the variations in obesity in these men.\r"

  ".W": "Although the nutcracker esophagus, characterized by high amplitude peristaltic contractions with mean distal amplitude greater than 180 mm Hg, is the most common esophageal motility disorder associated with noncardiac chest pain, little is known about its natural history. Therefore, we reviewed the manometric tracings of 23 patients with the nutcracker esophagus who had an average of 4.6 studies during a mean period of 32 months. Ten age-matched volunteers with normal baseline manometry who had undergone multiple studies (mean 5.8) over a mean time span of 32 months served as controls. In the 17 nutcracker patients with three or more motility studies, the variability of mean distal amplitudes between studies was 41.9% +/- 4.1 (+/- SE) compared to 27.0% +/- 3.3 for the control subjects (p less than 0.01). Highest distal pressures were noted during the first study in 11 of 17 patients (65%) compared to two of 10 controls (20%). The consistency of the diagnosis of nutcracker esophagus varied considerably: four patients always had high amplitude pressures, three patients only had the nutcracker diagnosis on the initial study, and 10 patients intermittently had pressures in the nutcracker range. Overall, these 17 patients had the diagnosis of the nutcracker esophagus confirmed on only 54% of subsequent studies. Changes in motility patterns were intermittently seen in six of 23 patients: one diffuse spasm and five nonspecific motility disorders. None of the control subjects developed high amplitude contractions or changed their motility pattern on serial testing. The possible pathophysiological implications of the changing faces of the nutcracker esophagus are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "88238504\r", 
  ".W": "In a group of 60 patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER), we carried out upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring to assess the relationship between acid reflux and esophagitis. The results of 24-h pH measurement were compared with those of 15 asymptomatic control subjects who were studied with ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring only. Thirty-two patients (53.3%) had a normal esophagus macroscopically, and 28 patients (46.7%) had some degree of esophagitis. There was no significant difference between the two groups with and without esophagitis, regarding male:female ratio, age, and duration of symptoms. The group with esophagitis was more symptomatic (p less than 0.001) than the group without, and differed significantly in relation to all pH variables, i.e., number of GER episodes per hour, duration of mucosal exposure to acid (pH less than 4), and number of GER episodes requiring more than 5 min to clear per hour for the upright, supine, and 24-h periods, compared with the control group (p less than 0.001) and the group without esophagitis (p less than 0.001). In the group with esophagitis, comparison of the above pH variables in the upright and supine periods showed significantly higher values in the upright than in the supine period for the total number of reflux episodes per hour (p less than 0.001) and the number of episodes greater than 5 min/h (p less than 0.05). We conclude that the presence of esophagitis is related to both frequency and duration of GER episodes. Our findings also stress the importance of daytime acid exposure in the pathogenesis of esophagitis.\r"

We assessed the relationship between chocolate ingestion and increased esophageal acid exposure using intraesophageal pH monitoring. Compared with ingestion of a dextrose control solution of similar volume, osmolality, and calories, postprandial ingestion of chocolate resulted in a significant increase in acid exposure in the first postprandial hour in patients with esophagitis. We conclude that this finding supports recommendations that patients with reflux esophagitis abstain from chocolate.\r"

The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the influence of age on gastroesophageal sphincter pressure, acid clearing ability, and acid gastroesophageal reflux in the same group of normal subjects. Ten healthy subjects were investigated in the period May 4, 1977, to February 18, 1978, and reinvestigated in the period August 19, 1985, to January 29, 1986. The median interval between the two investigations was 8.0 yr, range 7.7-8.5 yr. There were eight men and two women, with a median age at the second investigation of 36 yr, range 30-53 yr. Measurement of gastroesophageal sphincter pressure (GESP) and an acid perfusion test were performed, and within the same week, an acid-clearing test and a prolonged monitoring of pH in the distal part of the esophagus were carried out (5 cm proximally to the GES). pH monitoring was initiated between 7 and 8 PM and terminated between 7 and 8 AM. There were no changes in GESP between the two investigations. All had a normal acid perfusion test in both investigations. No changes in acid-clearing ability could be demonstrated. Similarly, the number of reflux episodes, as well as the duration of acid reflux, were unchanged. Integration of the pH curve for pH values less than or equal to 4 gave similar results at both occasions. In addition, the relative time with pH values less than or equal to 4 was unchanged. The acidity of the potential reflux material did not change over time, as evaluated by intragastric pH before and after monitoring. In conclusion, this study did not demonstrate any influence of age on esophageal acid defense mechanisms or spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

The chew-and-spit technique is esthetically distasteful and difficult to perform without some of the food being swallowed. Simple chewing of an inert substance does not stimulate acid secretion. We thus tested to determine whether chewing gum, a potent cholinergic stimulant of salivary secretion, also stimulates the stomach. We compared the gastric acid output stimulated by the chew-and-spit method, using a cheeseburger chewed for 15 min, with gastric acid output stimulated by chewing seven sticks of chewing gum over 15 min, in 12 patients with duodenal ulcer disease. Acid output stimulated by chewing gum was 36% +/- 5%, and by cheeseburger was 39% +/- 6% of pentagastrin maximum acid output (r = 0.97). We conclude that chewing gum is a simple, cheap, convenient method for testing vagally mediated gastric acid secretion.\r"

Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effect of phosphate restriction on the proteinuria of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in the rat. Uninephrectomy was performed in experimental and control groups to worsen the degree of diabetic nephropathy. Proteinuria was prevented in Sprague-Dawley rats treated with the intestinal phosphate binder, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate (DHAAA) (24.75 +/- 20.35 mg/d at 3 months v control, 77.45 +/- 44.72 mg/d, P less than 0.001); an effect that was independent of protein and caloric intake, plasma albumin and lipids, severity of diabetes, mean arterial pressures, cardiac output, and renal calcium accumulation. The effect of DHAAA on protein excretion and glomerular hemodynamics was examined in similarly prepared Munich-Wistar rats; these rats did not tolerate long-term studies. Three weeks of DHAAA again caused a consistent fall in proteinuria (5.98 +/- 7.28 v 34.94 +/- 24.28 mg/d) and in transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference (41.1 +/- 1.2 v 46.4 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, P less than 0.005). In conclusion, phosphate restriction significantly decreases the proteinuria of Sprague-Dawley and Munich-Wistar uninephrectomized rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus. Micropuncture of Munich-Wistar rats suggests that a reduction of intraglomerular pressure may be at least partially responsible for such an effect.\r"

At the time of diagnosis, none of the patients had evidence of active infection outside of the peritoneal cavity. Clues suggesting the diagnosis including a previous history of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, an excess number of eosinophils in the peritoneal fluid, and failure to respond to therapy directed against bacteria. C immitis in peritoneal fluid was more readily isolated on specific fungal culture media than on routine bacterial culture media. In no instances did potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparations of the fluid reveal fungi. Coccidioidal peritonitis during CAPD appears to be a localized form of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis that has a relatively benign course once the peritoneal catheter is removed.\r"

The responses were analyzed in terms of ABR thresholds, absolute latencies, and interpeak latencies. One patient had increased ABR thresholds, indicating hearing impairment. Five fra(X) subjects had prolonged I-V interpeak latencies. Comparisons between the fra(X) group (excluding one possible hard-of-hearing subject) and a control group of age-matched males with normal intelligence showed that the fra(X) group's interpeak latencies were significantly prolonged for the III-V and I-V but not for the I-III. This pattern of prolongation of interpeak latencies suggests that central, as opposed to peripheral, nervous-system dysfunction predominates in many patients having this syndrome. In addition, frequently observed prolongation of the transmission time may indicate that brain-stem white-matter functioning is also apt to be involved in this syndrome.\r"

The use of the polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) technique to preferentially amplify beta-globin DNA sequences that contain the most frequent beta-thalassemia mutations in Mediterraneans enabled us to rapidly analyze 58 beta-thalassemia alleles in a dot-blot format either by hybridization with allele-specific radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes or by direct sequence analysis of the amplification product. The Spanish population carries seven different beta-thalassemia mutations; the nonsense codon 39 is predominant (64%), whereas the IVS1 position 110 mutation, the most common cause of beta-thalassemia in the eastern part of the Mediterranean basin, is underrepresented (8.5%). The IVS1 mutation at position 6 accounts for 15% of the defects and leads to a more severe form of beta+-thalassemia than originally described in most of the patients we studied. In this study, we demonstrate further the usefulness of the dot-blot hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA in both rapid population surveys and prenatal diagnosis of beta-thalassemia.\r"

The objective of a short-term pain study is to determine whether a new treatment is effective and how it compares with a standard or reference drug for the indication being evaluated. Among the requirements for the pain model study are proper protocols and adequate, homogeneous patient populations. Problems in establishing the model include difficulty in finding adequate numbers of patients, inappropriate sites, patient resistance, and varying conditions of natural recovery. Suggestions are presented for conducting these studies: relying on global pain relief scores, keeping a home diary that is simple and objective, and extending the initial observation period in the office to generate single-dose data in a controlled environment. Sports medicine models are useful in allowing investigators the necessary numbers of patients and providing data that meaningfully address pharmacologic treatment for acute musculoskeletal disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Safe and effective therapy for acute musculoskeletal disorders would be extremely useful for competitive athletes. These injuries are common in these patients, who are usually highly motivated to return to their previous level of activity and performance. Because nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be useful in inflammation-associated conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, it was believed that their use in competitive athletes may be warranted. This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of two NSAIDs, piroxicam and naproxen, in these patients. The patients included 34 men and women who had acute symptoms including restrictions of movement and limitation of physical activity as a result of sprains to the ankle, acromioclavicular joint, and interphalangeal joint of the hand or acute soft-tissue injury to the shoulder, knee, or about the hip. In a double-blind, comparative, parallel manner, patients were randomly allocated to receive piroxicam 40 mg daily for two days and then 20 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily for two days, then 375 mg twice daily. Both drugs improved virtually all measures of physical discomfort after three and seven days of treatment (p less than 0.0001). Three days after beginning the study, the mean reduction in spontaneous pain, swelling, and tenderness was statistically superior in the piroxicam group (p less than 0.05) compared with the naproxen group. After seven days of treatment, a marginally larger reduction in swelling was associated with piroxicam (p = 0.081); however, no other statistically significant difference was seen. Although improvements in physical movement and strength were assessed, no consistent conclusion could be reached because of the small sample size; no statistically significant differences were seen between the treatment groups with respect to such improvements. Patient and investigator assessments of efficacy and tolerability were primarily excellent or good for both drugs. It was concluded that piroxicam and naproxen are effective and well-tolerated short-term treatments for acute musculoskeletal injuries in athletes.\r"

Ventricular ectopy occurred in 67 percent of patients and was strongly correlated by both univariate and multivariate analyses with total mortality and with sudden death. By multivariate analysis, ventricular ectopy was strongly associated with increasing patient age and with other evidence of cardiac and pulmonary involvement but not with clinical and laboratory measures of duration and extent of systemic sclerosis. Evidence of myocardial fibrosis thought to be secondary to microvascular alteration is common in systemic sclerosis, but the clinical implications of myocardial involvement are less well appreciated. The present data suggest the need for ambulatory electrocardiography in the clinical assessment of selected patients with systemic sclerosis, especially those with cardiac or pulmonary involvement, as well as for studies of the effects of antiarrhythmic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Existing methods for predicting creatinine clearance provide accurate estimates for normal-weight patients but not for patients who are obese. Studies into this problem began with an animal model of obesity, the obese overfed rat. Mean creatinine clearance was found to vary in direct proportion to fat-free body mass, determined in both obese and normal animals. The relevance of this observation to renal function in humans was evaluated by analyzing published studies reporting creatinine clearance and creatinine excretion rates in obese and normal persons. Measured creatinine clearance correlated well with estimated fat-free body mass (r = 0.772, p less than 0.02), and urinary excretion of creatinine normalized to fat-free mass correlated impressively with age (r = 0.960). Formulas derived from these observations allow for the prediction of creatinine clearance at steady state: (formula; see text) In initial tests of these formulas, their predictions appeared to be as accurate as existing methods for the normal-weight population and far superior to these methods when applied to the obese population. Therefore, when creatinine clearance is not measured in obese patients, the estimation of this parameter with the proposed formulas should improve the ability to select the appropriate dose for drugs that are cleared principally by renal filtration.\r"

Herein is reported the first case of Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic adrenocorticotropic production from a metastatic carcinoid tumor of the thymus that was treated with ketoconazole. Urinary cortisol excretion was totally suppressed at the initial dose and optimal control was achieved with relatively low doses of ketoconazole (200 to 400 mg per day), along with dexamethasone replacement.

Examination of the urinary sediment of three patients by polarizing microscopy showed birefringent needle-shaped crystals within leukocytes. In the most severely affected patient, a serum creatinine concentration of 8.6 mg/dl developed and the patient underwent percutaneous renal biopsy that revealed foci of interstitial inflammation without tubular necrosis. Urine, blood, and renal tissue levels of acyclovir were high. One patient was rechallenged with low-dose intravenous acyclovir and the four patients later received oral acyclovir, all without adverse effect. The combined data from these patients support crystalluria and obstructive nephropathy as a mechanism of acyclovir-induced renal failure in humans.

  ".W": "In a prospective study designed to differentiate pheochromocytoma from other forms of hypertension, urinary catecholamines were measured after sleep and clonidine administration in 12 patients with pheochromocytoma, 19 hypertensive patients in whom pheochromocytoma was suspected but later excluded, and 31 hypertensive patients in whom pheochromocytoma was never suspected. The test correctly identified all 12 patients in whom pheochromocytoma was present. Four of these had equivocal plasma levels of both norepinephrine and epinephrine, suggesting that overnight clonidine suppression may be of particular value when tumor secretion is intermittent or low. When pheochromocytoma was not present, urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were suppressed below 60 and 20 nmol/mmol creatinine, respectively, after sleep and clonidine, the two in combination giving better suppression than sleep alone. Since urinary catecholamines can be determined relatively easily by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, this test may be more widely applicable than suppression tests based on plasma measurements.\r"

In this study, turbidity measurements were used to compare the assembly and structure of clots formed from platelet-poor plasma by either the addition of thrombin or the exposure of recalcified plasma to glass. When clotted by recalcification, the lag phase before initial increase in turbidity was 10 to 25 times longer than when clotted by the addition of thrombin. Decreasing the ionic strength or increasing the calcium concentration shortened the lag phase. At high calcium concentrations (greater than 25 mM) polymerization was delayed and precipitation was noted. pH had a minimal impact over the range of 7.0 to 7.4. Fibrin fiber mass-length ratios for plasma gels formed by activation of the intrinsic cascade were virtually identical to those in gels formed by the direct addition of thrombin. These studies indicate that fluid phase coagulation events before the production of thrombin have a minimal impact on plasma fibrin structure.\r"

Six patients received two courses, two patients received three courses, and one patient received five courses. Twenty of 23 courses resulted in satisfactory improvement beginning 4.3 +/- 1.2 days after start of IVIg and becoming maximal 8.2 +/- 2.0 days, with sustained improvement lasting 106.6 +/- 49.1 days. Vital capacity increased from an average of 1845.1 +/- 489 cc to 2894 +/- 762 cc (p less than 0.01) at peak effect. Four of nine patients had a decrease in strength before improvement. There was no significant change in acetylcholine receptor antibody titers before or after therapy. Side effects were minimal. Of the three patients who had nonsatisfactory course, two responded well to additional IVIg. IVIg can produce repeated beneficial effects in patients with MG and may be useful as an adjunct in the management of MG.\r"

Four groups of animals were injected with gentamicin, 120 mg/kg daily for 5 days and were studied 2-4 days after the last injection. Electrolyte supplements were begun before the gentamicin injections and were continued throughout the study. The drinking solutions were tap water, NaCl, NaCl + KCl, or NaHCO3 + KHCO3 + diamox. At the end of the study, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine were markedly increased only in the group receiving tap water. Nevertheless, 24 hour creatinine clearance in awake rats and inulin clearance in anesthetized rats were found to be severely reduced in all gentamicin-treated animals. However, the rats receiving NaHCO3 + KHCO3 + diamox had significantly higher creatinine clearance than all other experimental groups. Proximal intratubular free-flow pressure, measured by micropuncture, and internal proximal diameters were significantly increased above normal controls in all groups, but were least abnormal in the rats receiving HCO3- and diamox. Semiquantitative histologic evaluation revealed significantly less tubular necrosis and cast formation in this group than in all the other experimental groups. The observations suggest that dietary sodium, potassium, and chloride supplements, even accompanied by large fluid intake, provide relatively little protection against gentamicin nephrotoxicity. In contrast, HCO3- and diamox supplements resulted in significant, albeit incomplete, protection of GFR and renal histology.\r"

Cellular bone marrow was re-established in two patients. A decrease of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly also occurred and was well correlated with the hematologic response. In one patient, when busulfan was discontinued for about 2 years after achieving an excellent remission, hematologic relapse was accompanied by increase of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. When busulfan treatment was resumed, hematologic response and decrease of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly reoccurred. This observation has demonstrated the beneficial effect of busulfan in chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis; therefore, the role of busulfan in the management of this disease should be further investigated.\r"

Atherosclerotic diseases, primarily myocardial infarction and stroke, are important causes of morbidity and mortality among women. Contrary to popular belief, the actual number of myocardial infarctions in men and women is similar, although women develop cardiovascular disease an average of 10 years later than do men. Total serum cholesterol level is a major indicator of risk of coronary heart disease; for every 1% increase in the total serum cholesterol level, a 2% increase in incidence of coronary heart disease is found. A high level of low-density lipoproteins is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease in both mean and women, but high triglyceride level is an independent risk factor only in women. Conversely, the higher the level of high-density lipoprotein, the lower the risk of coronary heart disease. To reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, target levels of total serum cholesterol must be lowered from 300 to 200 mg/dl. If the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio is greater than or equal to 4.5 of if the low-density lipoprotein concentration is greater than 150 mg/dl, the patient is at high risk for coronary heart disease. Clinical trials that use diet or drugs to lower serum cholesterol levels have consistently shown a 2% reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease for every 1% reduction in total serum cholesterol level.\r"

We evaluated the role of these risk factors in a 13-year follow-up study of 8935 premenopausal and 2716 postmenopausal women in the Walnut Creek Contraceptive Drug Study cohort in Northern California. Elevated cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, family history of heart disease, and diabetes were investigated for their contribution to premature death due to all causes and due to cardiovascular disease. In addition, risk factor profiles were developed separately for users and nonusers of Premarin (conjugated estrogen) in the postmenopausal cohort. The results show that the strongest predictors of cardiovascular mortality among premenopausal women were smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, with relative risks of 2.8, 10.5, and 11.6, respectively. A disparity between high cardiovascular risk factor prevalence and low rates of premature heart disease indicates that the high relative risks will not be accompanied by large attributable risks. Nevertheless, the study reconfirms the need for screening women for heart disease risk because life-style changes can improve cardiovascular risk factors and can potentially reduce the chance of premature death even further.\r"

In 34 patients with long-standing asymmetric retinopathy, no intraocular risk or protective factors were identified.\r"

Of the potential heterozygous carriers, three had normal rod-cone interactions, two had no detectable interaction, and two yielded technically unsatisfactory results. This lack of rod-cone interactions allows heterozygous individuals to be identified clinically and has implications concerning the origin of this inherited disorder.\r"

This study was conducted to determine the effect of a specific ethylene oxide sterilization procedure and freeze drying process on the initial mechanical properties of femur-ACL-tibia preparations. Twelve knees (stifle joints) from six mature goats were divided into two groups (one knee of pair to each group). Knees were cleaned of all soft tissue except for the anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, and collateral ligaments. Group 1 was sterilized with ethylene oxide (simulating clean procurement) then freeze dried. Group 2 was freeze dried only (simulating sterile procurement). The knees were rehydrated and then tested in tension to failure to determine their structural mechanical properties. The ethylene oxide-freeze dried specimens (Group 1) had a mean maximum load before failure of 2059 +/- 273 newtons (N) (+/- SE) which was not statistically different than the maximum load of the freeze dried specimens (Group 2) of 2023 +/- 214 N. The average strength of Group 1 and 2 combined was not significantly different than a third group of 12 normal femur-ACL-tibia controls which had an average maximum force of 2403 +/- 133 N. No significant differences between the groups were observed for stiffness, energy to maximum strength, or elongation to maximum force. It appears the freeze dry processing, with or without ethylene oxide sterilization, using the procedure we used, has, at most, a small effect on the initial mechanical properties of the preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The devices were placed unstressed, in an extraarticular location in the cortical-cancellous bone of the proximal femur and humerus of dogs. Six months following implantation tissue ingrowth was evaluated using high resolution radiography, routine histology, scanning electron microscopy, and biomechanical tensile tests to measure the ultimate (maximum) pull-out strength of the devices. The knitted dacron and Gore-Tex prosthesis showed marked ingrowth of trabecular bone into the interstices of the device with evidence of bone growth around individual fibers of the prosthesis. The bovine xenograft demonstrated bone immediately adjacent to the material with evidence of spicular ingrowth of bone into the natural clefts of the prosthesis. The LAD showed no evidence of bone ingrowth and demonstrated a fibrous tissue interface between the prosthesis and surrounding trabecular bone. Six months following implantation the pull-out strengths of the devices were as follows: knitted dacron, 445.7 +/- 151.0N; Gore-Tex, 438.1 +/- 131.94N; bovine xenograft, 332.8 +/- 64.2N; and LAD, 78.4 +/- 47.9N.

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to quantify the coactivation patterns of the knee flexor and extensor muscles as part of continued efforts to identify the role of the antagonist muscles in maintaining joint stability. The simultaneous EMG from the flexor and extensor muscles of the knee were recorded during maximal effort, slow isokinetic contractions (15 deg/sec) on the plane parallel to the ground to eliminate the effect of gravity. The processed EMG from the antagonist muscle was normalized with respect to its EMG as agonist at maximal effort for each joint angle. The plots of normalized antagonist EMG versus joint angle for each muscle group were shown to relate inversely to their moment arm variations over the joint range of motion. Additional calculations demonstrated that the antagonist exerts nearly constant opposing torque throughout joint range of motion. Comparison of data recorded from normal healthy subjects with that of high performance athletes with hypertrophied quadriceps demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on the hamstrings coactivations. Athletes who routinely exercise their hamstrings, however, had a coactivation response similar to that of normal subjects. We concluded that coactivation of the antagonist is necessary to aid the ligaments in maintaining joint stability, equalizing the articular surface pressure distribution, and regulating the joint's mechanical impedance. The reduced coactivation pattern of the unexercised antagonist to a hypertrophied muscle increases the risk of ligamentous damage, as well as demonstrates the adaptive properties of the antagonist muscle in response to exercise. It was also concluded that reduced risk of knee injuries in high performance athletes with muscular imbalance could result from complementary resistive exercise of the antagonist muscle.\r"

  ".W": "This study is an attempt to provide biomechanical support for the athletic practice of warming up prior to an exercise task to reduce the incidence of injury. Tears in isometrically preconditioned (stimulated before stretching) muscle were compared to tears in control (nonstimulated) muscle by examining four parameters: 1) force and 2) change of length required to tear the muscle, 3) site of failure, and 4) length-tension deformation. The tibialis anterior (TA), the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and flexor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles from both hindlimbs of rabbits comprised our experimental model. Isometrically preconditioned TA (P less than 0.001), EDL (P less than 0.005), and FDL (P less than 0.01) muscles required more force to fail than their contralateral controls. Preconditioned TA (P less than 0.05), EDL (P less than 0.001), and FDL (P less than 0.01) muscles also stretched to a greater length from rest before failing than their nonpreconditioned controls. The site of failure in all of the muscles was the musculotendinous junction; thus, the site of failure was not altered by condition. The length-tension deformation curves for all three muscle types showed that in every case the preconditioned muscles attained a lesser force at each given increase in length before failure, showing a relative increase in elasticity, although only the EDL showed a statistically significant difference. From our data, it may be inferred that physiologic warming (isometric preconditioning) is of benefit in preventing muscular injury by increasing the and length to failure and elasticity of the muscle-tendon unit.\r"

Average velocities at contact ranged from 5.9 to 8.2 m/s with peak velocities of 6.6 to 12.5 m/s reached 8 to 21 ms prior to hand/grove contact with the bag. Significant differences in shoulder and wrist velocitie, elbow angle excursions, and elbow angular velocities were seen when comparing hooks and jabs. Few differences were evident when comparing the kinematics of gloved versus bare-handed punches. Results are significant in providing kinematic data characteristic of experienced performers, which may be used in a kinetic model of punch impact and its relationship to potential injury mechanisms.\r"

Seventeen of the twenty-four patients with symptomatic anterior leg pain were diagnosed on the basis of tissue pressure studies as having chronic exertional compartment syndrome. The increased tissue pressures at rest and after exercise are most helpful in distinguishing those patients likely to benefit from a surgical fasciotomy.\r"

  ".W": "Transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation (TEMS) has been advocated as a method to rehabilitate the postoperative ACL repaired/reconstructed lower extremity. Isolated quadriceps contraction can potentially disrupt the ACL repair/reconstruction; to minimize this risk simultaneous quadriceps and hamstring stimulation has been used. This study measured the in vivo deformation of the ACL during TEMS of the quadriceps and hamstrings. Six legs in four Rhesus monkeys were immobilized in 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees of flexion in neutral rotation using a Hoffman frame and pins placed through the proximal femur and distal tibia. The hamstrings and quadriceps muscles were stimulated with a dual channel electrical stimulator individually and simultaneously at each point of flexion, and ACL deformation was measured using a Hall effect device placed on the anterior medial fibers of the ACL. The following conclusions were made: 1) Isolated quadriceps contraction produces ACL elongation at 0 degrees and 45 degrees of knee flexion and produces ACL shortening at 90 degrees of knee flexion. 2) Isolated hamstrings contraction produces ACL shortening at 45 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion and negligible effects at full knee extension. 3) It is not possible to simultaneously contract the quadriceps and hamstrings using separate stimulator pads for each muscle group. 4) At 45 degrees of knee flexion when the quadriceps muscles are stimulated before the hamstring muscles and simultaneous contraction of both is then sustained, ACL lengthening occurs. 5) When the hamstring muscles are fired before the quadriceps muscles and simultaneous contraction of both is sustained, ACL shortening occurs.\r"

Since it has not been possible to analyze relevant human tissue, an animal model was used to investigate the change in particular mechanical and morphological properties of rat tendon after a period of controlled exercise, with or without anabolic steroid supplementation. A significant difference (P less than 0.001) was found between the crimp angles and lengths of collagen fibrils and theoretical toe limit strains of the four groups under study. No other significant differences (P greater than 0.05) were observed. Controlled exercise and anabolic steroid administration produced the greatest change in crimp parameters and the largest theoretical toe limit strain. This implies that muscle contraction will be greater for a given stress and thus alter the normal biomechanics of limb movement. Further studies are required to determine more definitively the effects of anabolic steroids on a connective tissue such as tendon.\r"

Detection of these fractures is difficult by clinical and plain radiograph assessment, thus diagnosis may require acute awareness and special imaging tests.

Conduction-velocity recordings of the deep and superficial peroneal nerves were performed in 29 patients. Other investigations included radiography, plethysmography, and scintigraphy. CCS was diagnosed in 26 of the 98 patients. Other diagnoses included periostitis in 41 patients, compression of the superficial peroneal nerve in 13, and miscellaneous other diagnoses in 18.

Nineteen males and six females, mean age = 31.4 +/- 7.31 years, participated in this study. Fifteen subjects had received extraarticular and ten subjects had received intraarticular ACL reconstructions. Subjects completed a 100 point subjective functional activity questionnaire and a sports participation survey. Knee ligament stability was assessed during an objective knee examination. Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength were tested at 240 and 120 deg/sec using the Cybex II dynamometer. Anterolateral rotatory instability and positive Lachman were elicited on the operated leg for 80% of the subjects. No significant relationship was found between objective instability and the functional activity score. For the intraarticular group, a significant correlation (P less than 0.05) was found between increased quadriceps and hamstring strength on the operated leg and return to functional activities. Subjects' functional activity score was positively correlated (P less than 0.001) with their ability to participate in sports. Subjects participating in sports involving cutting and twisting motions were less successful in returning to their preinjury participation levels and reported more subjective complaints of pain, swelling, and/or instability. These results indicate that long-term progressive rehabilitation emphasizing increased quadriceps and hamstring strength to approximate the nonoperated leg may enhance successful return to functional and sports activities after ACL reconstruction.\r"

Twenty-three athletes, including six at the professional level, were evaluated an average 3.7 years after the Mumford procedure was performed for degenerative changes after a Grade I or Grade II dislocation. All athletes were evaluated with an in depth questionnaire, physical examination, and radiographic study. Seventeen performed Cybex testing of both shoulders. All but one were satisfied with the surgery. Sixteen returned to their same level of sports activity, including five of the six professional athletes. The most common complaint of all those not achieving the previous level of sports was the inability to achieve their previous maximum bench press strength. All athletes demonstrated full motion; five exhibited painless crepitation at the acromioclavicular joint. Ten of the twenty-three exhibited increased horizontal clavicular motion. Radiographs demonstrated an average of 1.9 cm of bone resection, with varying amounts of ossification present between the remaining clavicle and acromion in eight athletes. The involved limb performed significantly more work than the sound limb in flexion (P = 0.0133) and internal rotation (P = 0.0575) at 300 deg/sec. The involved limb performed significantly more repetitions at 300 deg/sec than the sound limb in the extension plane (P = 0.0373). The sound limb was significantly stronger during extension (P = 0.0759) and flexion (P = 0.0063) at 60 deg/sec compared to the involved limb.

  ".W": "Sixty sudden and unexpected lethal cardiac arrests, with entirely negative findings on autopsy, were reported among 50,314 morbidly obese patients in the care of surgeons performing operations to achieve weight loss. This represented an extrapolated overall annual mortality rate of 65 deaths per 100,000 patients, about 40 times higher than the rate of unexplained cardiac arrests in a matched nonobese population. Eight sudden deaths occurred while waiting for obesity surgery and 22 had cardiac arrest within 10 days after the operation. Late postoperative deaths (more than 4 weeks postoperatively) occurred in 30 instances. A possible marker of a predisposition for sudden, unexpected cardiac arrest was an electrocardiographic abnormality; namely, a Q-Tc interval prolonged to greater than 0.43 seconds. This feature, present in 29 of 38 tracings, denoted increased susceptibility to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The perioperative clustering of arrests implicated nonspecific stresses incident to otherwise uneventful operations as triggers of lethal dysrhythmias in the absence of organic cardiac disease. Anoxemia after abdominal surgery is an added hazard. Length of postoperative survival among the late deaths was found to be unrelated to degree of initial obesity or to magnitude of weight loss. Patients who died in the late postoperative phase were still grossly obese (mean weight 114.2 kg). Cardiac weights in patients who died within 10 postoperative days (12 patients) or after an average of 103 days (20 patients) were the same (464 and 469 g, respectively), indicating that myocardial mass had remained intact. The data do not suggest nutritional depletion or lean tissue loss as plausible explanations for the cardiac arrests. Screening and postoperative monitoring for Q-T interval prolongation is indicated. Prophylactic beta-blockade in this vulnerable subset of the morbidly obese population may be instituted in anticipation of obesity surgery. The attendant physiologic stresses should be minimized by appropriate measures.\r"

After injection of protamine sulfate, there was a decrease in mean arterial pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and an increase in the mean pulmonary pressure due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance; marked diminution of the number of circulating platelets aside from the extracorporeal circulation; a decrease in the contractility of both ventricles with augmented right ventricular work and decreased cardiac output; and right ventricular edema in Groups I, II, III, and IV.

The most frequent indications for surgery were stricture (58 percent) and fistula (29 percent). In the first 8 year period from 1971 through 1978, 13 of 14 operations were diversions (colostomy or by-pass). From 1979 through 1986, a more aggressive approach prevailed. Only 32 percent of the operations were diversions. This more aggressive strategy was accompanied by a decrease of the postoperative mortality rate from 21 percent through 1978 to 0 in the later period. The overall complication rate was 23 percent. Complications were relatively more frequent after two-layer sutured or stapled anastomoses and after resection or fistula closure without temporary colostomy. We conclude that in radiation-induced colonic and rectal lesions, diversion should be performed in patients with unproved cure of disease or tumor persistence. Resection and fistula closure can be carried out safely, and a temporary colostomy is strongly recommended.\r"

The influence of preoperative risk factors and the surgical procedure on surgical mortality was also investigated. Extrarenal atherosclerosis was present in 51 percent of the patients, and hypertensive target organ damage was present in 66 percent. Renal artery reconstruction was performed unilaterally in 92 patients and bilaterally in 20 patients. Simultaneous aortoiliac operations were performed in 25 patients. There were nine operative deaths (8 percent). The presence of extrarenal atherosclerosis was particularly associated with mortality (14 percent compared with 1.8 percent when it was absent; p = 0.02). The surgical procedure also represented a significant risk; the mortality rate was 1.4 percent if surgery was restricted to unilateral reconstruction, but otherwise it increased to 20 percent (p = 0.001). This increase in mortality rate was clearly associated with aortoiliac surgery (20 percent compared with 4.6 percent when aortoiliac surgery was not performed; p = 0.025) and could be explained by the increased blood loss during operation. We conclude that the surgical treatment of renovascular disease secondary to atherosclerosis can be safely performed, provided that extrarenal atherosclerosis is absent and that simultaneous aortoiliac surgery can be avoided.\r"

Overall, 23 percent of patients with shotgun wounds of the head and neck region had injuries of other anatomic areas that required operative treatment.

  ".W": "Endoscopic sphincterotomy has allowed us to extract relatively large stones from the common bile duct as compared with other methods utilizing a T-tube tract or the percutaneous transhepatic route. Twenty-four patients with large stones over 20 mm in diameter were selected and reviewed from a series of 469 sphincterotomy patients. Eleven stones passed into the duodenum spontaneously, the maximal size of which was 30 by 43 mm. Passage occurred within 4 days after sphincterotomy in 27 percent, 5 to 7 days after the procedure in 55 percent, and 8 to 13 days after the procedure in 18 percent and was accompanied by cholangitis in 55 percent of the patients. The small diameter of the stone and common bile duct dilatation down to the distal end seemed to be the factors favoring stone delivery. Five stones were removed using ordinary basket catheters by duodenoscopy; however, the largest one required 28 attempts. More recently, four stones were efficiently extracted after destruction by electrohydraulic or mechanical lithotripsy. Failure of removal in five patients was mainly due to a lack of space around the stone for basket manipulation or occurrence of severe cholangitis. Further refinements in technique in this regard are needed.\r"

With persistent postoperative pain, the offending nerve is usually difficult to identify. A protocol has been suggested to differentiate ilioinguinal from genitocrural causalgia. When the particular nerve is incriminated, its division will ordinarily cure the problem.\r"

Anxiety was assessed using the Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory and 10-cm linear analogue scale. A standardised explanation of an hypothetical premedication study was given and the patients' consent requested. Results were grouped for those who granted (n = 33) and those who withheld (n = 10) consent: anxiety scores for the latter were significantly higher (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that patients with high pre-operative anxiety levels are more likely to withhold consent for inclusion in premedication studies than are those who are less anxious. Seeking informed consent would introduce bias into studies of anxiolytic premedication.\r"

Sixty children between 3 and 13 years of age were randomly allocated to receive rectal diclofenac 2 mg/kg, intramuscular papaveretum 0.2 mg/kg or no medication immediately after induction of anaesthesia. Pain and appearance were assessed 1, 3 and 6 hours postoperatively, and the following morning. The assessments were double-blind and performed by the same observer. No significant differences in postoperative pain were found between the groups at any time. The use of diclofenac was associated with a significantly more rapid return to calm wakefulness and had significantly less effect upon respiratory rate. Consumption of paracetamol on the day of operation was significantly less in the diclofenac group. Diclofenac may offer advantages compared to papaveretum with regard to safety and convenience for use in the treatment of pain after tonsillectomy in children.\r"

The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and end tidal PCO2 were measured before and after the drugs were administered. A mild degree of respiratory depression occurred, which was maximal at 3-30 minutes after injection.

Morphine concentrations were generally higher in the gluteal group although the mean peak concentrations (62.8 ng/ml in the gluteal group and 52.3 ng/ml in the deltoid group) were similar. Peak morphine concentrations varied from 22.5-99.3 ng/ml in the gluteal group and 26.5-84.5 ng/ml in the deltoid group. The area under the concentration-time curve was significantly greater in the gluteal group than in the deltoid group but this difference disappeared when allowance was made for differences in body weight of the two groups.

The tracheal tube cuff was inflated by a trained assistant using a syringe and the initial cuff pressure measured; the minimum cuff pressure required to prevent respiratory gas leakage was also measured and the cuff pressure maintained above this pressure throughout the operation by means of the Cardiff Cuff Controller. Initial cuff pressure values averaged 11.9 kPa for males and 13.5 kPa for females compared with minimum cuff pressure values of 5.2 and 1.2 kPa, respectively. The differences between initial and minimum pressures were statistically highly significant (p much less than 0.001). It is concluded that the present method of inflation may lead to gross overinflation of tracheal tube cuffs and that cuff pressure monitoring may be performed simply by means of an electropneumatic controller. The difference in minimum cuff pressure between males and females suggests that the difference in tracheal size between the sexes is greater than the 9-mm to 8-mm difference in tracheal tube size.\r"

A highly significant increase in the blood flow to fingers of the blocked hand was observed throughout the period of anaesthesia but there was no overall increase in the blood flow to the arm.

To estimate dose-response relations, three subgroups of nine patients in the ISO group received mivacurium doses of 0.025, 0.03, and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively. Similarly, three subgroups of nine patients in the BAL group received mivacurium doses of 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. The ED50 and ED95 of mivacurium in each group were estimated from linear regression plots of log dose vs probit of maximum percentage depression of neuromuscular function. The estimated ED50 values for the ISO and BAL groups were 0.029 and 0.041 mg/kg, respectively. The estimated ED95 values for the ISO and BAL groups were 0.045 and 0.058 mg/kg, respectively. Recovery indexes were measured in 26 patients who received ED95 or greater doses of mivacurium in either the ISO or BAL groups. The recovery index was shorter in the BAL group (5.5 +/- 1.6 minutes [n = 10]), than in the ISO group (7.4 +/- 3.0 minutes [n = 16]). The addition of isoflurane (0.5-0.75% end-tidal concentration) to nitrous oxide-narcotic anesthesia augments the degree of neuromuscular blockade from a given dose of mivacurium and also prolongs the recovery index.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted in 33 open chest, anesthetized dogs to evaluate direct effects of hemodilution on myocardial oxygenation and contractile function. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was perfused selectively from a controlled pressure reservoir with either normal arterial blood or arterial blood diluted with lactated Ringer's solution. Systemic hemodynamic parameters were held stable. In the LAD bed, values were obtained for coronary blood flow (CBF) with an electromagnetic flowmeter, myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) using the Fick principle, and percentage segmental shortening (%SS), an index of local myocardial contractility, by sonomicrometry. Studies were conducted with LAD perfusion pressure (PP) set at control (100 mm Hg) and at 50% of that level to simulate coronary insufficiency (CI). CI abolished coronary reactive hyperemia after release of a 90-second occlusion, indicating exhausted vasodilator reserve capacity. With PP at control, reductions in LAD hematocrit to as low as 10% had no effect on MVO2 or %SS, because increases in blood flow were sufficient to offset induced falls in arteriovenous oxygen content difference. However, during CI, a more modest reduction in hematocrit to 17% caused reductions in both MVO2 and %SS, because of inadequate flow responses during hemodilution. The following conclusions can be made: 1) Extreme hemodilution is well tolerated by the normal heart with a stable work requirement and; 2) Relatively modest hemodilution may compromise myocardial oxygenation and contractile function when in the presence of exhausted or severely depleted vasodilator reserve capacity.\r"

In addition, intrathecal narcotics decrease spasticity in patients with central nervous system disease. This study of the effects of intrathecal fentanyl on posterior tibial SSEPS and the monosynaptic H-reflex arc found that intrathecal fentanyl had no effect on the latency of SSEPS, indicating the effects of narcotics on SSEPS are likely to exist at a supraspinal level. H-reflexes were not affected, confirming the lack of effect on this spinal motor reflex. In the same group of patients, intrathecal lidocaine administered 1 week later completely abolished SSEPS and H-reflexes. Complete suppression of SSEPS corresponded to full motor blockade, but sensation to pain and temperature was already many dermatomes higher than the S1 level. Return of SSEPS occurred with return of motor but not sensory function, indicating the likelihood that SSEPS are carried at least in part by large A-fibers. The study shows that spinal narcotics neither affect the transmission of SSEPS nor decrease the H-reflex, a spinal motor reflex. In addition, changes in SSEPS after intrathecal lidocaine do not correlate with the level of surgical anesthesia.\r"

We also studied the relationship between auditory amnesia and auditory evoked potentials to determine if long-latency auditory evoked potentials (LLAEPs) could be utilized as electrophysiologic predictors of memory. Amnesia was produced by administration of 0.05 mg/kg lorazepam intravenously. To separate the changes in LLAEPs due to generalized sedation from those associated with amnestic properties of a drug, a third group of subjects given 1.5 mg/kg secobarbital was included. Observed frequency and duration of amnesia to auditory stimulation after lorazepam was 58% and 3 hours, respectively (mean values), with marked diminuition of antirecall effect at 120 minutes. Administration of lorazepam increased the latency and decreased the amplitude of N1 and P3 components of LLAEPs. These changes appeared to be a result of generalized sedation rather than the amnestic properties of the drug. We failed to find a definite relationship between amnesia and changes in LLAEPs. We conclude that P3 component of LLAEPs cannot be utilized as an electrophysiologic predictor of amnesia in humans.\r"

Each anesthetic was administered for 2 hours at 1.6 MAC (inspired). Control rats were given phenobarbital but not exposed to an anesthetic. In rats pretreated with phenobarbital and exposed to I-653, fluoride ion concentrations in serum and excretion of fluoride ion and organic fluoride in the urine were almost indistinguishable from values measured in control rats. In contrast, rats pretreated with phenobarbital metabolized small but significant amounts of isoflurane. In rats pretreated with ethanol and exposed to I-653, the 24-hour excretion of urinary organic fluoride was nearly ten times greater than that observed in control rats. Marked increases in organic fluoride (as high as 1000 times control values) and/or fluoride ion were found in serum and/or urine after anesthesia of phenobarbital-pretreated rats with halothane or methoxyflurane. The relative stability of I-653 indicates that it may possess minimal toxic properties.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have proposed combining isovolemic hemodilution and controlled hypotension to limit blood loss during surgery. Before such a technique can be considered for clinical use, it must be demonstrated that it does not endanger maintenance of adequate myocardial oxygenation. Accordingly, measurements of left ventricular myocardial blood flow and oxygen consumption were obtained during isovolemic hemodilution alone and in combination with adenosine-induced controlled hypotension in ten pentobarbital-anesthetized, open chest dogs with normal coronary circulation. Hemodilution to a hematocrit of 21.7% was produced by isovolemic exchange of whole blood for 5% dextran. In the presence of hemodilution, adenosine was infused intravenously at a rate sufficient to decrease mean aortic pressure to 51 mm Hg. Myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres and used to calculate global left ventricular myocardial oxygen consumption and oxygen supply. Hemodilution alone increased aortic blood flow (+43%) but had no effect on aortic pressure, left atrial pressure, heart rate, or left ventricular dP/dtmax; an increase in myocardial blood flow (+130%) maintained oxygen supply and consumption at the baseline level. Adenosine-induced hypotension during hemodilution decreased heart rate (-35%), left ventricular dP/dt max (-28%), and aortic blood flow (-14%). These systemic responses were accompanied by reduced myocardial oxygen consumption (-29%) and increased myocardial blood flow (+54%) and myocardial oxygen supply (+72%). These latter effects resulted in reduction in the coronary arteriovenous oxygen content difference and in an attendant rise in coronary sinus Po2 (+66%), which are signs of luxuriant myocardial perfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88239038\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary baroreceptors located primarily on the low-pressure side of the circulation sense slight reductions in cardiac filling pressures and elicit sustained peripheral vasoconstriction. Because most inhalation and many intravenous anesthetics attenuate arterial baroreflex function, the low-pressure baroreflex may serve a major role in maintaining blood pressure during intraoperative hypovolemia. To activate the low-pressure baroreflex, progressive nonhypotensive reductions in central venous pressure were produced with graded applications of lower body negative pressure (LBNP, -5, -10, -15 mm Hg) in 18 ASA class I patients before elective surgery. This produced linear reductions in stroke volume as determined by impedance cardiography and cardiac output. Cardiopulmonary baroreflex-mediated increases in total and forearm vascular resistance assisted in maintaining stable blood pressure. After ten patients were anesthetized with fentanyl (12.5 micrograms/kg) and diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) and an additional eight received these agents plus supplemental N2O (70%), reflex vasoconstrictor responses to LBNP were not attenuated and, therefore, blood pressure continued to be well maintained despite substantial reductions in cardiac filling pressures. Thus, these anesthetic regimens preserved vasoconstrictor responses mediated by cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. This promoted cardiovascular stability that may be particularly beneficial in patients with cerebral, cardiovascular, or renal disease undergoing surgical procedures with potential for rapid blood loss.\r"

Postoperative evaluations included the frequency and magnitude of clinically evident respiratory depression, the adequacy of analgesia, nausea, pruritis, the ability to ambulate, and other side effects for 24 hours. Analgesia and the number of supplemental narcotic injections needed were similar in both groups. The incidence of nausea and pruritis was significantly less in the patients receiving fentanyl. No patient developed respiratory depression in either group. Patient and staff acceptance of the continuous epidural technique was excellent because there were only minor catheter-related problems associated with its use.

The median time required to achieve maximal height of the sensory blockade and the median highest level of sensory anesthesia did not differ in the two groups. Alkalinized bupivacaine increased significantly the median times for regression to the T12 and L2 segments by 15 and 25 minutes, and the duration of complete motor block by 15 minutes, as compared to the hydrochloride salt.

The only thermoregulatory responses available to anesthetized, hypothermic patients are vasoconstriction and non-shivering thermogenesis. To test anesthetic effects on thermoregulation, the authors measured skin-surface temperature gradients (forearm temperature--finger-tip temperature) as an index of cutaneous vasoconstriction in unpremedicated patients anesthetized with 1% halothane and paralyzed with vecuronium during elective, donor nephrectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo maximal warming (warm room, humidified respiratory gases, and warm intravenous fluids; n = 5) or standard temperature management (no special warming measures; n = 5). Skin-surface temperature gradients greater than or equal to 4 degrees C were prospectively defined as significant vasoconstriction. Normothermic patients [average minimum esophageal temperature = 36.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C (SD)] did not demonstrate significant vasoconstriction. However, each hypothermic patient displayed significant vasoconstriction at esophageal temperatures ranging from 34.0 to 34.8 degrees C (average temperature = 34.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C). These data indicate that active thermoregulation occurs during halothane anesthesia, but that it does not occur until core temperature is approximately equal to 2.5 degrees C lower than normal. In two additional hypothermic patients, increased skin-temperature gradients correlated with decreased perfusion as measured by a laser Doppler technique. Measuring skin-surface temperature gradients is a simple, non-invasive, and quantitative method of determining the thermoregulatory threshold during anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous post-anesthetic tremor that resembles shivering is common during recovery from anesthesia. Risks to postoperative patients include an increase in metabolic rate of up to 400%, hypoxemia, wound dehiscence, dental damage, and disruption of delicate surgical repairs. The etiology of spontaneous post-anesthetic tremor is most commonly attributed to normal thermoregulatory shivering in response to intraoperative hypothermia. However, the mechanism of this tremor remains unknown, hampering prevention and treatment. The present study was designed to determine whether mechanisms other than thermoregulation contribute to the tremor. The electromyograms (EMGs) of eight muscles were observed in nine women during recovery from isoflurane anesthesia. Signals from each muscle were compared to those of pathologic clonus induced by plantar flexion in unanesthetized patients with spinal cord transections and to those of cold-induced shivering in normal, unanesthetized subjects. Two distinct EMG patterns were identified: 1) regular, bursting signals of 5-7 Hz similar to those produced by pathologic clonus in patients with spinal cord transections; and 2) tonic, irregular signals of 5-15 Hz which had poorly defined bursts that did not demonstrate the synchronous 4-8-cycle/min waxing and waning pattern typical of normal shivering. EMG activity occurred most often at expired isoflurane concentrations of 0.1-0.19%, and was not related to rectal temperature. During the later part of recovery when isoflurane concentrations were less than or equal to 0.1%, hypothermic patients frequently demonstrated no clinical or EMG evidence of muscular activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control EMAC was determined by the tail-clamp method in 15 mongrel dogs. Each animal then received at least three incremental infusion rates of MID from among the following: 0.48, 2.4, 9.6, 19.2, 28.8, 48, or 151.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. MAC was determined during each infusion rate following a 1-h observation period, during which time MID concentration in plasma [( MID]) stabilized. [MID] was measured every 15 min beginning 45 min from the start of each new infusion rate. There was a linear relationship between MID infusion rates and the resulting [MID] (r = 0.995). In the range of [MID] from 14 to 14,118 ng/ml, there was a linear relationship between the log [MID] and the percent EMAC reduction. The slope of the line was very shallow, and the [MID] required to reduce EMAC by more than 50% exceeded the [MID] likely to be employed clinically in humans (750 ng/ml). Also, the 73 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) EMAC reduction produced by [MID] = 9,763 +/- 1213 ng/ml was not significantly greater than the 60 +/- 3% EMAC reduction achieved by [MID] = 1,464 +/- 293 ng/ml, a finding which suggests a ceiling effect to the anesthetic efficacy of midazolam. The authors conclude that, within the dose range of MID likely to be employed in humans, MID produced a concentration-dependent reduction of enflurane MAC in the dog. In doses above those likely to be employed clinically, a ceiling effect to the anesthetic efficacy of MID may become evident.\r"

The EB-ethanol(A) was found to be related directly to the serum glycine concentration (R2 = 0.75) and, inversely, to changes in the serum sodium concentration (R2 = 0.81). The cumulative absorbed volume of irrigant could be predicted from a single EB-ethanol(A) reading at the end of each 10-min interval (R2 = 0.82); the reliability was improved by taking into account the absorption time (R2 = 0.89). Extravasation of irrigating fluid was indicated by a stable or increasing EB-ethanol(A) after the ethanol-tagged irrigant had been discontinued. Ethanol monitoring is a simple and inexpensive method of testing for the presence, and measuring the degree, of irrigant absorption in transurethral prostatic surgery.\r"

The effect of fentanyl citrate infusion on single-dose verapamil pharmacokinetics was examined in six animals. The effects of verapamil infusion (3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and 6 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were examined in the conscious state and during fentanyl infusion plus pancuronium on two separate occasions in nine dogs. In addition, the effects of fentanyl citrate (500 micrograms.kg-1 followed by 1.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were examined over 1 h of infusion. Fentanyl infusion did not affect single-dose verapamil pharmacokinetics. In the conscious animals, verapamil increased heart rate and PR interval, and slightly decreased LV dP/dt. Fentanyl combined with pancuronium increased mean arterial pressure and LV dP/dt. During fentanyl infusion, verapamil decreased mean arterial pressure and LV dP/dt, increased PR interval, and did not change heart rate. The hemodynamic effects of fentanyl infusion were steady over 1 h. In contrast to the inhalational anesthetics, which alter verapamil pharmacokinetics and have mainly additive effects with verapamil on left ventricular contractility, cardiac conduction, and regional blood flows, fentanyl-pancuronium had no effect on verapamil pharmacokinetics and minimal effect on verapamil pharmacodynamics in healthy dogs.\r"

SA nodal tissue was isolated from guinea pig hearts and suffused in vitro with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution. Electrophysiologic variables measured were: amplitude of the AP, slopes of phase 4 and of phase 0 of the AP, AP duration, and spontaneous sinus rate. The authors found that 1 and 2 MAC equivalents of each anesthetic, 0.8 and 1.6 vol % halothane, 1.4 and 2.8 vol % isoflurane, and 1.7 and 3.4 vol % enflurane similarly depressed the slopes of phase 4 and 0 of the AP, prolonged AP duration, and slowed the sinus rate at 1 and 2 MAC equivalents. Isoproterenol, 0.25 microM, and epinephrine, 50 microM, maximally enhanced the slopes of phase 4 and 0 of the AP, shortened AP duration, and increased the sinus rate, but phenylephrine, 50 microM, only moderately increased the slope of phase 4 and the sinus rate. Each of the three anesthetics caused baseline depressions of phase 4 and phase 0 slopes and of automaticity of SA nodal cells; the fall in sinus rate was counteracted, but was not reversed maximally by increasing the concentrations of isoproterenol, epinephrine, or phenylephrine. Regression analyses of linearly transformed data showed that each of the anesthetics similarly depressed basal sinus rate, so that changes in rate produced with isoproterenol and epinephrine were not different from those observed with beta agonists in the absence of anesthetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The arrhythmogenic doses (ADs) of various combinations of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists were determined in dogs (N = 105) during halothane anesthesia. Isoproterenol (ISP) and phenylephrine (PHE) administered separately failed to induce arrhythmias in doses up to 4 micrograms/kg and 200 micrograms/kg, respectively. The interaction between ISP and PHE in inducing arrhythmias showed typical hyperbolic isoboles. At a systolic pressure of 140 mmHg, the AD of ISP in the presence of PHE was significantly lower than that in the presence of angiotensin II (ANG II). At a systolic pressure of 150, 160, 170, or 180 mmHg, there was no significant difference between the AD of ISP in the presence of PHE and that in the presence of ANG II. Increasing heart rate by electrical pacing did not replace ISP in the arrhythmogenic interaction between ISP and PHE. The results indicate that both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists are important for producing arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia, and that these agonists synergistically interact on the heart by different mechanisms.\r"

The force of contraction of the adductor pollicis was measured and compared with the diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG). Cumulative dose response curves were determined for pancuronium in 18 patients divided equally into three age groups: 0-1 yr, 1-3 yr, and 3-10 yr. The potency of pancuronium at both muscles decreased with increasing age (P less than 0.05), while the adductor pollicis:diaphragm potency ratio remained constant. The mean doses (+/- SEM) required to depress adductor pollicis first twitch responses by 90% (ED90) were 42 +/- 3.3 micrograms/kg in the 0-1-yr group, 47 +/- 4.2 micrograms/kg in the 1-3-yr group, and 62 +/- 4.1 micrograms/kg in the 3-10-yr group. Corresponding figures for the diaphragm were 70 +/- 4.3 micrograms/kg, 81 +/- 5.1 micrograms/kg, and 101 +/- 4.4 micrograms/kg, respectively. The ED90 ratios (diaphragm ED90/adductor pollicis ED90) in the three age groups were 1.69 +/- .07, 1.75 +/- .14, and 1.64 +/- .09, respectively. These results are consistent with similar rates of maturation of the diaphragm and the adductor pollicis muscles in infancy and childhood. Thus, train-of-four monitoring of the adductor pollicis is likely to overestimate the degree of neuromuscular blockade of the diaphragm in pediatric patients.\r"

Twenty patients had been treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs for at least 4 weeks before the study; 11 unblocked patients served as control group. The extent of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade was quantified using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. The dose of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min was defined as the CD25 (chronotropic dose 25), representing the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Geometric mean CD25/70 kg was 3.8 micrograms in the control group, and 24.5 micrograms in the patients receiving beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The authors found a significant inverse relationship between CD25 values and changes in cardiac index in response to three dobutamine infusion rates (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), the correlation coefficients being -0.78, -0.79, and -0.82, respectively. Compared to unblocked patients, almost no change, or even a decrease, of the cardiac index was observed at higher degrees of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Moreover, there was a significant linear correlation (r = 0.66 - 0.75) between CD25 values and the effects of dobutamine on systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), i.e., SVRI decreased in control patients, but increased in patients with high degrees of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade. This unmasked vasocontrictive response to dobutamine was observed despite the fact that the majority of our patients had received cardioselective adrenergic blocking drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When these liver microsomes were incubated with different concentrations of etomidate, dose-dependent inhibition of ketamine N-demethylation, a cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymatic process, was produced. Cytochrome P-450 binding spectra displayed type II binding with a UV light absorption maximum (lambda max) at a wavelength of 424 nm in the presence of etomidate. In vivo studies were conducted using ketamine and antipyrine as substrates. Evaluation of antipyrine's pharmacokinetic variables after an intravenous infusion of etomidate (0.34 +/- 0.17 mg/kg) revealed an 18% increase in its elimination half-life (P = 0.04). In addition, there were 16% and 11% decreases in the area under the curve (P = 0.05) and in the clearance rate (P = 0.07) for antipyrine, respectively. In patients administered a bolus dose of ketamine during brief outpatient operations, etomidate produced no significant changes in ketamine's pharmacokinetics compared to thiopental. The authors conclude that the etomidate-induced inhibition of hepatic drug metabolism can prolong the elimination of drugs with low hepatic clearance rates (e.g., antipyrine). However, etomidate would not be expected to alter the rate of elimination of high clearance anesthetics and analgesic drugs (e.g., ketamine, fentanyl).\r"

All patients had programmable pulse generators, CPI model number 531. The voltage in this pulse generator can be reduced from 5 to 2.5 volts. The pulse width threshold (PWT) at implantation was 0.06 ms at 5 volts in all 38 patients, and the PWT at implantation varied between 0.06 and 0.16 ms at 2.5 volts, with a mean PWT of 0.092 +/- 0.026 ms. The 38 patients were restudied six months later. The mean PWT measured at 5 volts was 0.076 +/- 0.018 ms. The PWT measured at 2.5 volts varied between 0.08 and 0.30 ms with a mean PWT of 0.178 +/- 0.067 ms. Twenty-three patients were restudied one year after lead implantation. The PWT measured at 2.5 volts varied between 0.08 and 0.30 ms with a mean PWT of 0.156 +/- 0.061 ms. All of the pulse generators were reprogrammed to 2.5 volts. This permitted a substantial prolongation of the pulse generator life (three to five years) with an improvement in the cost effectiveness of the pulse generator.\r"

  ".U": "88239127\r", 
  ".W": "The relationship between regional left ventricular (LV) motion and global pressure relaxation of the left ventricle remains unclear. To clarify the recent concept of segmental early relaxation in coronary artery disease, the authors investigated two groups of patients. In group I, all 12 patients (mean age 47 +/- 7 years) exhibited evidence of a normal heart after an extensive investigation. In group II, 25 patients (55 +/- 7 years) presented an isolated stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and they underwent a hemodynamic investigation before and after (six to nine months) a durable successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). After all conventional hemodynamic measurements had been done, a quantitative frame-by-frame analysis of left ventricular wall motion was conducted. The authors' method is derived from that of Ingels, applying to LV cineangiograms filmed in 30 degrees right anterior oblique view at a 50 frames/second rate. Thus segmental wall motion is analyzed in terms of amplitudes (%), velocities of shortening and lengthening in circumferences/second (circ/sec), and times of events (%). Statistical results took into account the reproducibility of the method. Main results regarding the control state of group II consisted of an asynergic motion of the anterior region taking place from end systole to early diastole: 1. Early end of contraction in anterior segments (% of systolic time interval: 88 +/- 14% vs 96 +/- 6% in group I, p less than 0.001) 2. Asynchronism at end systole (maximal velocity of shortening - 0.4 +/- 2.3 circ/sec in anterior segments vs 0.05 +/- 1.9 in inferior segments, p less than 0.02) 3. An early but poor outward anterior wall motion (anterior lengthening at 0.04 sec after the end of ejection 2.9 +/- 10% in group II versus 5.4 +/- 7.2% in group I, p less than 0.05) These abnormalities are strongly correlated with a significant impairment of peak negative diastolic pressure/diastolic time (dP/dt) (1500 +/- 400 mmHg. sec-1 vs 1850 +/- 410 in group I, p less than 0.02). Long-term beneficial effects of PTCA in group II were characterized by an almost complete normalization, both asynergy and relaxation taking place back within the normal range. The authors conclude that in this kind of patient, peak negative dP/dt could be an index of an asynergic segmental motion, this one being correctly analyzed and quantified on LV cineangiograms with our method.\r"

Serum cholesterol was determined in patients with hypersplenism before and after splenectomy. Meanwhile serum lipids were determined in two groups of rabbits: splenectomy group (Spx group, n = 19), and sham operation group (Sham group, n = 14) before and after the operation. Then the rabbits were divided into four subgroups: cholesterol-fed groups--Spx-C (n = 12) and Sham-C (n = (9), and normal-chow-fed groups--Spx-N (n = 7) and Sham-N (n = 5). The Spx-C and the Sham-C rabbits were fed 1% cholesterol diet and the Spx-N and Sham-N rabbits were fed normal chow for twelve weeks. In patients preoperative serum cholesterol levels were low, and significant increase in serum cholesterol was observed following splenectomy. In rabbits, the Spx-C group showed significantly higher levels of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids in contrast to lower levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, as compared with the Sham-C group. The percentage of aortic plaque area in the Spx-C group tended to be higher than that in the Sham-C group. On the other hand, the Spx-N and the Sham-N group showed no difference in serum lipids during twelve weeks. The worsening of atherosclerosis in the Spx-C group was considered to be mainly due to an enhanced hyperlipidemia. Their results suggest a possible role of the spleen in lipid metabolism, in particular the existence of a splenic factor that can cause hypocholesterolemia in hyperplenism and can suppress hyperlipidemia.\r"

In this study, 192 high-risk patients, aged forty to ninety-two, received 125I fibrinogen and had daily radioactive scans, venous Doppler, and strain gauge plethysmography. Four preventive methods were used until patients became ambulatory: graded compression stockings (GCS) in 39, elastic bandages (EB) in 33, subcutaneous administration of 5,000 USP units of heparin (HEP) bid in 39, and oral administration of 0.5 g of acetylsalicyclic acid (ASA) bid in 35. Results were compared with those in 46 patients in a control group (CG). Twelve patients in CG, none in GCS, 4 in EB, 1 in HEP, and 2 in ASA developed DVT proved by contrast venography. There was a statistically significant difference between GCS and CG (P less than 0.0003), HEP and CG (P less than 0.0022), and ASA and CG (P less than 0.0148) but not between EB and CG (P greater than 0.10); no significant differences were found between any pair of prophylaxis groups. The significant differences could not be attributed to differences in age, sex, or length of stay in bed. PE occurred in 3 patients in CG and 1 in EB. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 7 patients in HEP and 4 in ASA, requiring exclusion of 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively, from the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors assessed the value of this agent in treating myocardial ischemia in 11 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris. Maximal, symptom limited treadmill exercise stress tests were performed before and after six weeks of therapy with 1200 mg of pentoxifylline per day. Clinical symptoms proved in 9 [82%] of patients; none developed drug side effects. After therapy, mean total exercise time [7.7 +/- 1.3 vs 10.1 +/- 1.2 minutes], time to onset of angina [5.5 +/- 0.9 vs 7.9 +/- 1.0 minutes], heart rate at onset of angina [93.4 +/- 6.7 vs 112.0 +/- 10.5 beats/min] and rate at onset of ST depression [94.0 +/- 5.8 vs 115.9 +/- 7.4 beats/min] all increased significantly [p less than 0.05]. Mean maximum ST segment depression also decreased [1.6 +/- 0.3 vs 1.2 +/- 0.4mm], but the difference was not significant. Thus, pentoxifylline increases exercise performance in patients with angina pectoris and increases exercise capacity before development of of myocardial ischemia. It may, therefore, be a useful agent for treating ischemic heart disease.\r"

The mean observation period was fifty-six months (range thirty-six to sixty). On admission patients presented with increased platelet aggregation and/or impaired red cell filterability and with enhanced red cell aggregation. Five patients in the pentoxifylline group (8.6%) and 16 control patients (38%) suffered a relapse of an ischemic episode. These data support previous reports of a beneficial effect of pentoxifylline in the prevention of cerebral ischemic events.\r"

A submaximal treadmill exercise test performed before and during treatment demonstrated that nebivolol significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure from a mean value of 158 +/- 5.4 bpm to 131 +/- 4.3 bpm and from 171 +/- 4.9 mmHg to 144 +/- 4.5 mmHg respectively. The data from the STI and ERNA were calculated and analyzed independently by two observers. A highly significant (r = 0.8182, p = 0.0038) correlation was found between the changes of stroke volume (SV) and PEPc/LVETc during treatment with nebivolol. Furthermore end-diastolic volume significantly(p = 0.03) increased from a mean value of 177 +/- 10.1 ml to 198 +/- 6 ml and stroke volume significantly (p = 0.01) increased from 120 +/- 6.8 ml to 136 +/- 6.3 ml.

Nine dogs were subjected to five minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) without CPR followed by countershock and closed-chest CPR. Intravascular pressures, coronary perfusion pressure, and coronary sinus flow were measured during conventional CPR. After countershock, and before CPR, the frequencies of the following ECG variables were assessed: the presence or absence of P waves, an abnormal QRS duration (greater than 100 ms), a prolonged QTc (greater than 430 ms), and a bradyarrhythmia (QRS rate less than 60/min). Twenty-three episodes of postcountershock EMD were studied. Countershock after prolonged VF without CPR was always followed by EMD. The mean values of ECG variables were not significantly different (P greater than .05) between animals successfully resuscitated and those that were not. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of individual ECG variables in estimating successful cardiac resuscitation exhibited a wide range of values. The QTc had the highest sensitivity (1.00), but the lowest specificity (0.08). The presence or absence of P waves had the highest specificity (0.62), but a sensitivity of only 0.40. QRS rate had the greatest positive predictive value (0.48) but a negative predictive value of 0.46 for successful cardiac resuscitation. The QTc had the greatest negative predictive value (1.00) but a positive predictive value of only 0.45. Multiple regression analysis using the study ECG variables as independent variables demonstrated that ECG variables were not related to outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "ECG patterns observed during cardiac arrest were analyzed in 261 comatose cardiac arrest survivors. Forty-seven patients (18%) exhibited electromechanical dissociation (EMD) at some point before restoration of stable spontaneous circulation. These patients had a higher mortality (P = .05) and a lower rate of cerebral recovery (P = .01) during the one-year follow-up than study patients who did not exhibit EMD. Patients who developed EMD subsequent to defibrillation had better outcome than patients presenting with EMD. Multivariate analysis revealed that age more than 70 years old (P = .007), pulmonary disease (P less than .001), diabetes (P = .013, in-hospital arrests only), and prearrest hypoxemia (P = .013, outside-hospital arrests only) were independently predictive of the occurrence of EMD. Although the generalizability of these findings is limited, they may offer new clues to the pathophysiology of EMD.\r"
