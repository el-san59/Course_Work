  ".W": "Basal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as determined by a highly sensitive immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) were evaluated in 30 clinically euthyroid patients receiving levothyroxine (T4) replacement therapy for primary hypothyroidism. In each patient, the serum TSH level had been normal as determined by conventional TSH radioimmunoassay while the patient had been receiving a constant dosage of T4 for at least three months before the study. Correlation of the TSH levels by IRMA with the concurrent concentrations of serum T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) showed that basal TSH levels by IRMA were not predictable from the serum T4 and/or T3 levels. We observed a relatively high frequency of suppression of basal TSH levels (8/30, 27%), a finding compatible with, though not necessarily indicative of, overmedication with T4. In view of the reasonable suspicion that modest but protracted overmedication with T4 may be detrimental and that suppressed TSH levels are commonly observed in conventionally managed patients, and since suppression of TSH levels is now identifiable, it seems prudent to revise the guidelines of T4 replacement therapy accordingly. In addition to maintaining clinical euthyroidism, we propose that titrating the T4 dosage to establish lower normal TSH concentrations without suppression (eg, 0.1 to 3.0 microU/ml) would assure the resolution of frank hypothyroidism, reduce the likelihood of persistent goiter, and minimize the potential for subtle but chronic overmedication.\r"

In the past a number of well known dyslexics have made substantial contributions in various disciplines, including a few in medicine. Without appropriate assistance, many dyslexic students will be unable to compete successfully and to complete medical school. With appropriate assistance, however, they can complete medical school and become competent, creative professionals. Dyslexic medical students must be held to the same standards expected of other students. In our experience they require only (1) assistance with study skills, (2) limited academic tutoring in some courses, (3) extended time on written examinations, and (4) separate rooms for written examinations to avoid distractions. These special considerations on examinations are also allowed by the National Board of Medical Examiners.\r"

Concomitant examinations, such as biopsy, histologic studies, roentgenograms, scintiscanning, acid secretion, serum gastrin and review of the operative reports, were done. Duodenal ulcers (1,219) and gastric ulcers (421) were examined preoperatively. Of these, selective proximal vagotomy and pyloroplasty and excision of the ulcer were performed for 1,018 duodenal ulcers. Forty-three per cent were examined postoperatively. Selective proximal vagotomy and pyloroplasty and excision of ulcer were performed for 315 gastric ulcers. Thirty-nine per cent were examined postoperatively. Recurrence was calculated in relation with the patients examined postoperatively. Recurrence of duodenal ulcer occurred in 6.3 per cent; of these, 0.9 per cent had duodenal ulcers develop into gastric ulcers. The recurrence rate of gastric ulcer is 8.1 per cent; of these, 0.8 per cent developed into duodenal ulcers, and 0.8 per cent to carcinoma of the stomach. Data of recurrent ulcers were compared with the data for the total number of patients who underwent surgical treatment. The possible causes for a recurrence are demonstrated. In duodenal ulcers, 79 per cent of recurrences are due to technical error (inadequate vagotomy and incomplete drainage); in gastric ulcers, 90 per cent of recurrences are due to technical error. In both duodenal and gastric ulcers, causes are partly based on advanced clinical symptoms. Recurrence rates showed a tendency to increase between 1969 and 1975 and 1976 and 1983. This correlated directly with the deterioration of the clinical signs and symptoms between 1969 and 1983, shown in increased acid secretion, increase and shift of ulcers and stenoses, increase in bleeding and changed epidemiologic findings.\r"

For the 1 kilogram weight, the output from the pressure sensor, which was placed on the blade, was decreased as the thickness of the silicone elastomer was increased. Pressures loaded on central and marginal regions of the large intestine were more than seven times greater than that on the mesenteric region with use of a conventional clamp. In contrast, pressures on all of the mesenteric, central and marginal regions were relatively low and uniform with use of clamps equipped with silicone elastomer. These results indicate that the clamp equipped with the silicone elastomer damages tissues only to a small extent because of the dispersion effect of the pressure and the uniformity of the pressure distribution.\r"

Serious cardiac morbidity and death were predicted by the presence of pre-existing cardiac disease, specifically, congestive heart failure and valvular heart disease. Patients at increased risk for non-cardiac complications (infection, renal insufficiency and cerebral ischemic events) included 24 per cent of those patients with diabetic end-organ disease (retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy), 29 per cent of those with congestive heart failure or valvular heart disease and 35 per cent of those with peripheral vascular disease and infection. In patients who did not have such pre-existing conditions, serious noncardiac complications were rare (4 per cent). Neither the severity of the disease nor the degree of perioperative glucose control were associated with increased postoperative morbidity or mortality. We conclude that, among patients with diabetes mellitus who are undergoing surgical procedures, postoperative complications can be predicted by the presence of readily identifiable preoperative clinical characteristics.\r"

All patients have maintained normal platelet counts at an average follow-up period of 12.4 months (range of one to 37 months). There were no postoperative deaths. Morbidity was minimal; in two patients, wound seromas developed.

  ".W": "The clinical presentation and survival rate for 30 patients with Stage IV carcinoma of the breast in whom the M1 disease was limited exclusively to the bones were compared with those of 30 women with stage, age and menopausally matched carcinoma of the breast with M1 disease limited exclusively to nonosseous tissue. The clinical findings at presentation and the histologic grades of the cancers (70.0 per cent grade II for osseous versus only 36.7 per cent for nonosseous), relative to the mean duration of tumor presence, identify the cancer with exclusive skeletal metastases as less aggressive. Also, the median survival time of the patients with bone-only metastases was 12 months as compared with six months for the nonosseous metastatic group. It is concluded that exclusive skeletal metastases identify more slowly growing carcinoma of the breast and is, therefore, prognostically significant.\r"

  ".W": "Concern regarding the quality of surgical treatment performed within resident training programs and the need for direct, active involvement of the attending surgeon have been issues of interest to surgeons and the public. To provide specialized training in the diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease, vascular surgical fellowships have been established. In institutions with established vascular fellowships, one may question whether general surgical residents or vascular surgical fellows should perform carotid endarterectomies. The majority of carotid reconstructive procedures are performed at our institution by the chief general surgical resident under direct supervision. We elected to review our experience with surgical treatment of the carotid artery in an effort to examine the safety of this practice. The record of all patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy or reconstruction from April 1980 to July 1984 were reviewed. One hundred and twenty-nine patients who underwent 153 reconstructions of the carotid artery constituted the study group. The indication for operation was symptomatic carotid atheromatous disease in 96 and asymptomatic disease in 57. Ninety-three per cent of the procedures were performed by the chief general surgical resident under the supervision of one attending surgeon. Although the incidence of associated systemic problems (hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease) was significant in the study group, postoperative cardiovascular and cranial nerve and central neurologic deficits were 1.3 per cent, respectively, with no operative mortality. At our institution, the performance of carotid endarterectomy under close supervision provides an excellent context in which the resident in training may learn precise and careful dissection of the tissue and arterial repair. The need for formal vascular surgical fellowships to develop proficiency in judgment, technique and management of vascular disease is not questioned. However, as a learning experience for the general surgical resident, we believe this practice is both safe and effective, and a high standard of patient care is not compromised.\r"

To avoid life-threatening situations arising from pacemaker inhibition or ventricular fibrillation during cautery for transuretheral resection, three basic factors were considered: 1, appropriate type of pacemaker; 2, the proper grounding of all medical electronic equipment used during the procedure, and 3, the directing of the complete flow of the electrocautery circuits substantially below the level of the pacemaker unit.\r"

Anastomoses performed after two days of obstruction in the ileum had a higher rate of complications than operations performed upon control rats (p less than 0.05). Obstruction of the small intestine resulted in increased content of collagen of the ileal wall as a consequence of increased synthesis of collagen, but this resulted in neither increased capacity to hold suture nor in any differences in development of strength between rats operated upon for obstruction of the small intestine and control rats. Increased turnover of collagen was noted in the vicinity of the anastomoses after obstruction, which might be related to the increased rate of complications found. Rats with complications accumulated more collagen in the intestinal wall after one week compared with rats with obstruction and uncomplicated healing. These rats had persistent obstruction or formation of granuloma, or both.\r"

At the same time, the number of negative explorations could have been reduced from 13 to 7, while the number of positive explorations would remain the same. The decision tree provides a systematic approach to the use of intraoperative cholangiography, thereby saving operating time and cost. By using this approach, the surgeon can not only select those patients in whom intraoperative cholangiogram will be useful in determining the need for exploration of the common duct and finding the unexpected common duct stone, but also eliminate [corrected] its use in those patients who have no clinical indications.\r"

Of the 1763 active farmers (response rate 69%) who participated in the study, 270 were suspected of having farmer's lung and divided, on the basis of clinical and serological criteria, into probable and possible farmer's lung groups. This subgroup of 270 patients was examined in more detail with physical examination, chest radiographs, and pulmonary function tests. Probable farmer's lung was diagnosed in 77 cases (53 men and 24 women, mean age 51.7 years), a prevalence of 43.7/1000. Possible farmer's lung was present in a further 193 subjects. Fever was the most specific symptom. In the group with probable farmer's lung the frequency of crepitations, restrictive ventilatory defect, and radiological interstitial abnormalities was 21.5%, 9.5%, and 9.2% at the time of the study. Farmer's lung was more common in the middle tablelands than in the plain or mountain areas (p less than 0.01). The difference in prevalence of farmer's lung between the Mouthe mountain and Levier middle tableland districts (25.2/1000 and 60.8/1000) raises the possibility that cold may protect against the disease. Farmer's lung was more frequent in men and in the age group 51-55 years. Among possible occupational factors, only regular work connected with feeding animals was associated with a significant risk (odds ratio 2.55 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.09-5.93). The frequency of chronic bronchitis in the population studied was 14.8%. There was a close link between farmer's lung and chronic bronchitis, 50.6% of patients with probable farmer's lung having it but only 8.6% of patients without farmer's lung (p less than 0.001). In patients with probable farmer's lung chronic bronchitis was independent of smoking and age. There were fewer smokers in the probable farmer's lung than in the non-farmer's lung group (p less than 0.05).\r"

Correct prediction of location, size, and tissue density was obtained in all 60 cases. Correct identification of the nature of the tumours was achieved by computed tomography in 37 of the 54 previously undiagnosed cases. Particular attention was given to the evaluation of the relation of the tumour to adjacent mediastinal structures, to predict the feasibility of radical surgical procedures. Overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in identifying resectability were 46%, 85%, and 64%, with positive and negative predictive indices of 78% and 58%. Capsulated or highly invasive lesions were clearly distinguished, and the presence or absence of infiltration of mediastinal vessels, pericardium, and chest wall was correctly recognised in most cases. It is suggested that the evaluation of anterior mediastinal neoplasms should include computed tomography because of its accuracy in predicting size, location, and tissue density of the neoplasm. Computed tomography may suggest, often with good reliability, the histological type of the tumour and its relation to contiguous mediastinal structures, thus contributing to the choice of the appropriate surgical approach or route for biopsy.\r"

Propranolol and histamine were given by nebuliser to a maximum dose of 16 mg/ml and 32 mg/ml respectively and the response was measured as the provocative concentration of agonist causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). A PC20 histamine value of less than 32 mg/ml was obtained in 24 of the 32 children, of whom 15 had a measurable PC20 propranolol (less than 16 mg/ml). In these 24 children the geometric mean PC20 histamine was 4.5 mg/ml and 14.4 mg/ml respectively in those with and without a measurable PC20 propranolol (p = 0.023). There was a linear relationship between histamine and propranolol PC20 values (r = 0.60), and between PC20 histamine and FEV1 % predicted (r = 0.43), but not between PC20 propranolol and FEV1 % predicted (r = 0.38). In an open time course study in 12 children with asthma recovery of FEV1 after inhaled propranolol was incomplete in seven of the children after 90 minutes. When inhaled propranolol was followed by inhaled ipratropium bromide in a further 11 children FEV1 had returned to baseline in all children after 60 minutes. Thus propranolol inhalation can be used in children with asthma to assess the contribution of the beta adrenergic system to the regulation of bronchial smooth muscle tone. The test has several disadvantages in comparison with histamine provocation-long duration, the prolonged action of propranolol, and the fact that only the children with substantial hyperreactivity to histamine react to propranolol.\r"

Rhinitis induced by cold air was associated with lower FEV1 (p less than 0.01) and the association remained after adjustment for smoking, asthma, and wheezing (p = 0.06). Symptoms induced by cold air were related to circulating basophils. Neither perceived nasal nor perceived bronchial hyperresponsiveness was significantly related to the airway response to methacholine in a sample of the group (n = 324) surveyed again five years later. The result suggest that the symptom of rhinitis provoked by cold air is a possible \"new\" risk factor or marker for chronic airflow limitation.\r"

At normal hematocrit and a platelet count of 100,000 per microliter, platelet adhesion and platelet aggregate (PAG) formation on subendothelium were statistically decreased. At lower platelet counts (50,000/microliter), there was an even more marked reduction in the formation of PAGs. The critical role of RBCs was demonstrated in experiments at low hematocrit; the formation of PAGs was impaired in perfusions at 20 percent hematocrit at any platelet count tested. Platelet deposition on subendothelium was almost absent at 50,000 platelets per microliter, suggesting a negative synergistic effect for the association of low hematocrit (20%) with a low platelet count. Perfusion experiments carried out with nonanticoagulated blood drawn directly from anemic patients with mild thrombocytopenia (43,000-58,000 platelets/microliter) before and after RBC transfusion were in agreement with previous experiments that indicated that normalization of both platelet count and hematocrit is required to achieve optimum hemostasis. Our data give experimental support for the transfusional management of patients with anemia and thrombocytopenia.\r"

Characterization of their antibodies was performed by 1) use of recombinant HIV proteins; 2) determination of cross-reactivity to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HTLV-IV: 3) assessment of immune status; and 4) identification of potentially interfering autoantibodies. Nineteen of 20 donors maintained the same HIV antibody reactivity throughout the follow-up period; the other donor became fully antibody-positive. Eighteen of 20 donors' sera showed clear reactivity with HIV recombinant core proteins. Ten of 19 donor samples demonstrated cross-reactivity to HTLV-IV; 3 of these 10 also cross-reacted with HTLV-I. The immune status of all donors was normal, although the medical histories and HLA antibody screens suggested possible autoimmune reactivity in 9 of 18 donors. During follow-up interviews, three donors reported possible risk factors for HIV infection that had not been acknowledged at the time of blood donation. We conclude that exclusion of donors with these atypical serologic test results is warranted while further studies to determine significance are being conducted.\r"

This study examined the expression of multiple-RBC p80 epitopes by autosomal and X-linked recessive-type Lu(a-b-) RBCs in order to explore the relationship, if any, between expression of In(Lu)-related p80 and Lutheran antigens. Both autosomal and X-linked types of recessive Lu(a-b-) RBCs expressed near-normal to increased amounts of p80 antigens, as measured by radioimmunoassay. P80 from both types of recessive Lu(a-b-) RBCs had apparently normal molecular weight in denaturing polyacrylamide gels and showed normal sensitivity to digestion by trypsin and chymotrypsin. Thus, the absence of Lutheran antigens on recessive-type Lu(a-b-) RBCs is not associated with decreased or absent p80 antigens. Furthermore, the XS2 gene probably does not act via a mechanism similar to that of the In(Lu) gene, since the expression of p80 remains undiminished in X-linked recessive-type Lu(a-b-) RBCs.\r"

In addition, when validation of a particular result is requested, an in-line segment may be convenient for confirmatory testing. While a dilutional effect was found, the anticoagulant in the main collection bag was not shown to have affected enzyme activity. During storage the mean enzyme concentration decreased. Appropriate plasma ALT cutoffs for respective time periods during storage were calculated to compensate for downward drift. This correction prevented the use of the blood units (40% of total) that would erroneously have appeared transfusable if the serum cutoff had been used. If the Day 0 plasma cutoff was used throughout the total storage time period, 14 percent of the blood would erroneously have appeared transfusable.\r"

We studied the effects of irradiation on stored platelet concentrates and evaluated whether platelets could be stored for 5 days in the irradiated state without adverse effects on their viability. Using a pair-controlled design in which each of six normal subjects acted as his or her own control, we compared in vitro storage characteristics and in vivo kinetics of platelet concentrates exposed to 30 Gy and stored for 5 days with those of platelet concentrates simply stored for 5 days without irradiation. Irradiation had no significant effects on in vitro storage characteristics (platelet count, mean platelet volume, pH, and white cell count) or on in vivo kinetics, including initial recovery and mean platelet survival. Using the multiple-hit model, initial recovery was 49.6 +/- 10.8 percent, and mean platelet survival was 5.6 +/- 1.05 days for irradiated concentrates, compared with 51.3 +/- 13.0 percent and 5.9 +/- 0.50 days, respectively, for the unirradiated control concentrates. We conclude that irradiation of platelet concentrates with up to 30 Gy has no effect on their in vivo recovery or survival, and that irradiation administered before storage of platelet concentrates does not interfere with their clinical efficacy.\r"

The platelet count, white cell count, pH, glucose, lactate, platelet aggregation and release reaction, and serotonin uptake were not altered by the irradiation of random-donor or apheresis units with 2000 rads carried out at 0 and 24 hours and 5 days after collection. The leaching of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate from the plastic bags followed by the conversion to mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate was not increased by irradiation. Therefore, it is possible to irradiate platelet concentrates on the day of collection and subsequently store them for at least 5 days while maintaining in vitro function. This procedure could have considerable benefit for blood banks involved in the provision of many platelet products.\r"

No association was found between any HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-DR phenotype and the presence of RBC alloantibodies, either in general or when analyzed according to the specific antibody. Renal transplant patients with RBC alloantibodies were somewhat more broadly HLA-alloimmunized than were those without RBC alloantibodies. Patient gender did not affect these results. The authors concluded that the immune response to RBC alloantigens is independent of HLA type but is associated with an increased level of HLA antibody formation.\r"

Their hematologic status was determined by performing complete blood counts on a venous blood specimen and measuring ferritin as an indication of iron stores in a representative sample of approximately 10 percent. Normal blood counts were found in some donors, while others had severe degrees of anemia, and such discrepancies could be clarified only by hemoglobin determinations. Iron deficiency was very common in deferred donors, including 36 of the 88 with normal blood counts in whom ferritin assays were performed. Microcytic blood cells, a hallmark of iron deficiency, were found to be a relatively insensitive measure of low iron stores, except at low levels of hemoglobin. By a check of a venous sample, the hematologic status of most volunteers failing the copper sulfate screening test can be ascertained, and appropriate review, investigation, and treatment can be undertaken.\r"

Evidence is provided that the Inb antigen is denatured by papain, ficin, trypsin, bromelin, cystein-activated papain/dithiothreitol, 6 percent aminoethylisothiouronium, and 50 mM dithiothreitol, but not by neuraminidase. Inb antigen strength appears reduced on the In(Lu) type but not on the LuLu type of Lu(a-b-) RBCs. RBCs from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria showed normal Inb antigen strength as did Ko, Ge:-2,3, Ge:-2,-3, and Yt(a-) RBCs.

Investigation of a suspected case of cisplatin-induced hemolytic anemia in a 40-year-old man demonstrated that IgG could be adsorbed nonimmunologically by reagent red cells in vitro. This phenomenon was found to be a source of possible error in the interpretation of studies identifying specific cisplatin antibodies. Furthermore, cisplatin was found to be capable of producing a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), owing to the nonspecific adsorption of immunoglobulin and complement in vivo. Although this finding did not result in acute hemolysis, it may cause confusion in the investigation of DAT-positive hemolytic anemias. We question whether previous reports of cisplatin-induced hemolytic anemia are accurate in their assessment that such hemolysis was mediated immunologically. Future studies of suspected cases of hemolysis induced by this drug should include serologic investigation adequate to demonstrate the presence of specific cisplatin antibodies. A positive DAT in such patients should not be considered proof of drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia.\r"

  ".W": "In light of increasing public and employee concern over potential infectious hazards associated with blood and other body fluids, several government agencies (the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health Care Financing Administration and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute) cosponsored a Biosafety Workshop in April 1988. The objective of the workshop was to identify appropriate biosafety practices and standard control procedures to protect workers involved in the collection, storage, and transportation of human blood donations with the least possible disruption of the nation's blood supply. Speakers focused on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV); however, the safety principles discussed were considered equally applicable to other known (e.g., non-A, non-B hepatitis and human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) blood-transmitted infections. The resulting consensus included the need for blood establishments to develop and apply thoughtful biosafety programs to address staff training, accident prevention, HBV vaccination, handling spills, managing contaminated waste and transporting blood specimens. There was lack of agreement, however, on the usefulness of gloves during the phlebotomy of healthy blood donors.\r"

Although reduced to about half the normal control values, both alpha- and beta-LCAT activities were present in the patient's plasma. It has been shown earlier that secretion of LCAT is linked to that of VLDL, but since patients with abetalipoproteinemia cannot form either chylomicrons or VLDL, our results suggest that a secretion of these triglyceride-rich lipoproteins do not seem to be a prerequisite for a basal secretion of beta-LCAT.\r"

Fifty-four (57%) relatives answered a written questionnaire. The relatives of 70% of home dialysis patients and 27% of center dialysis answered the questionnaire. The answering relative felt most angry and uncomfortable with the decision, ascribed the least anger and most comfort to the patient and an intermediate value to the rest of the family. Staff physician and resident ranked highest in involvement in making the decision, social workers and chaplains the lowest. Once the decision was made, social workers and nurses were most caring and helpful, residents and chaplains were rated the lowest. The relatives felt that they and the patients were the ones who most often brought up the decision to stop and also made the final decision. The relatives thought that the incompetent patients were most angry and uncomfortable but that they felt that decision to be right. The family and relatives were particularly angry and uncomfortable when the patient had discontinued dialysis for the stress of the procedure alone and not any medical complications. In these cases there was most family disagreement and the staff received startling low scores, both for involvement and caring and helpfulness. In answers to open-ended questions, the relatives expressed disappointment with physicians who were unwilling to talk to them, were overly optimistic and continued too long with treatment. They wished for more openness and truthfulness. No long-term psychological harm seems to have come to the relatives and families with one exception. Our finding suggests that more meetings with families and patients and openness about problems and complications during chronic dialysis and follow-up and counseling of families after the patients have died should be helpful.\r"

In the first population screening, 1,625 of 2,000 (81%) invited individuals participated. Diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg was recorded in 19% and 9% were on drug treatment for hypertension. Median cholesterol level was 6.10 mmol/l and the frequency of hypercholesterolemia was high. A body mass index of greater than or equal to 30, indicating severe obesity, was observed in 9%, a lower proportion than in most other European populations. Among men, the total proportion of tobacco consumers was 49%, including 22% snuffers. Of the women, 31% were tobacco consumers, very few being snuffers. Women had, in general, a more favorable cardiovascular risk factor profile up to the age of 45. Thereafter, the two genders were similar. By international comparisons, the population in northern Sweden is characterized by high serum cholesterol levels, intermediate blood pressure levels, a relatively low prevalence of severe obesity and a high consumption of smokeless tobacco.\r"

The event rate in those without ischemic changes either on the exercise test or on Holter was only 8.5%. Among patients with good (greater than 40%) or reduced (less than 40%) left ventricular ejection fraction, those with transient ST depression on Holter had a significantly higher cardiac event rate compared with those without it. A similar event rate was found in patients with only silent, only symptomatic and with silent and symptomatic ischemic episodes.\r"

To better define prognosis in this population, the clinical course of 183 diabetics with AMI was studied. In-hospital mortality for all patients was 28% (52 of 183 patients). Mortality was significantly higher in patients with prior AMI than in patients without prior AMI (41 vs 18%, p less than 0.01) and was significantly higher in women than in men (37 vs 19%, p less than 0.01). The 2-fold increase in mortality among diabetic women was observed both in patients with and without prior AMI. The excess mortality among diabetic women was attributable to their increased risk for severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and cardiogenic shock. Death due to CHF occurred in 22% of all diabetic women with AMI compared with 6% of the diabetic men (p less than 0.01). Death resulting from complications other than CHF was similar for both sexes. There were no male-female differences in the history of prior AMI, systemic hypertension, obesity, nephropathy, frequency of Q-wave AMI, anterior AMI or peak creatine kinase levels to account for the high risk for CHF in diabetic women. It is therefore concluded that diabetic women with AMI are at increased risk for death due to CHF, and that this risk is not readily attributable to known conditions associated with CHF.\r"

Ninety-four AMI patients with greater than or equal to 1 VT on Holter electrocardiographic monitoring who were not taking antiarrhythmic drugs were studied. Forty-seven patients had a recent AMI (group A) and 47 an old AMI (group B). Chronobiologic analysis was made by single cosinor method. There were 157 VTs (mean 1.67 VTs/patient, range 1 to 10) in the 94 patients: 70 in group A and 87 in group B. A significant circadian rhythm of VT was found in the total population with acrophase at 2:29 P.M. The hourly distribution of VT showed a tendency to bimodality, which seemed due to a different time of peak VT occurrence in group A (significant rhythm with acrophase at 4:40 P.M.) and group B (significant rhythm with acrophase at 12:39 P.M.). Thus, the hourly VT frequency in patients with AMI has a significant circadian variation with the highest occurrence in the awake hours, similar to the rhythms described for AMI and sudden death.\r"

Two hundred eighty-six patients (33%) had in-hospital postinfarction angina. During a mean follow-up of 31 months, patients with postinfarction angina were more frequently (p less than 0.001) hospitalized for cardiac causes and underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery; however, their cardiac mortality rates at 1 year (8.4%) and at 4 years (14.3%) were not significantly different from those among patients without postinfarction angina (7.1 and 12.9%, respectively). The only anginal characteristic found to be associated with increased subsequent cardiac mortality (17.9% at 1 year, 39.2% at total follow-up) was high frequency angina (greater than or equal to 1 daily episodes). High frequency angina occurred in a small subset of 28 patients (3.2% of the study population, 9.8% of patients with postinfarction angina). Clinical variables representing higher grades of mechanical dysfunction and electrical instability after infarction were significantly more common among patients with high frequency angina than among those with low frequency angina. Cox survivorship analysis revealed that high frequency angina made a significant contribution to the risk of post-AMI cardiac death (hazard ratio 2.5, p = 0.01), which was independent of the effect of predischarge reduced radionuclide ejection fraction and Holter-recorded frequent or repetitive ventricular premature complexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At rest, myocardial uptake of fatty acids was 50% lower in CAD patients than in the control subjects (p less than 0.001), whereas uptakes of glucose and lactate were twice as high (p less than 0.01). CAD patients showed increased myocardial glutamate uptake (p less than 0.001) and alanine release (p less than 0.001). In control subjects, myocardial fatty acid uptake was directly related (r = 0.54, p less than 0.01), whereas uptakes of glucose (r = -0.42, p less than 0.05) and lactate (r = -0.46, p less than 0.05) were inversely related to arterial fatty acid levels. Citrate release was inversely related to glucose uptake (R = 0.44, p less than 0.05). These relations were absent in CAD patients. Glutamate consumption correlated only with glucose uptake in CAD patients (p less than 0.001) but did so with lactate uptake and alanine release in all individuals (p less than 0.001). Pacing caused angina in the CAD patients but not in the control subjects. Pacing induced no metabolic changes among control subjects but provoked myocardial lactate release in 40 CAD patients, including an additional decrease of fatty acid uptake (p less than 0.05) and increase of glucose uptake (p less than 0.05) compared with resting levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In such a case, ischemia is attributed to maldistribution of coronary flow during dipyridamole-induced vasodilation. The present study evaluated the potential role of dipyridamole testing in producing ischemia through a vasospastic mechanism, following rapid withdrawal of vasodilation induced by aminophylline. The possibility was tested in 36 in-hospital patients with variant angina pectoris who underwent dipyridamole infusion (up to 0.84 mg/kg over 10 minutes) with continuous 12-lead electrocardiographic and 2-dimensional echo monitoring. Medications were withdrawn from all patients. The test was pharmacologically stopped with the dipyridamole antidote (aminophylline, 80 to 240 mg intravenously over 1 to 3 minutes) in all patients. Two to 6 minutes after starting aminophylline infusion, 10 patients (28%) developed (greater than 0.10 mV) ST-segment elevation (2.9 +/- 0.8 mm from baseline), always accompanied by obvious asynergy detected by echocardiography, in the same electrocardiographic leads showing spontaneous or ergonovine-induced ST-segment elevation. Nitrates promptly resolved ischemia in all patients. At coronary angiography, 5 of these 10 patients showed significant CAD (greater than 70% lumen diameter reduction of at least 1 major coronary artery), whereas 5 had nonsignificant CAD. The rate pressure product at the onset of ST-segment elevation (after dipyridamole plus aminophylline) was considerably less than that recorded at peak exercise stress test in these patients (9,600 +/- 2,200 vs 18,400 +/- 4,900, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) were assessed in 24 patients with coronary artery disease. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed in 15 patients. PGE1 was found to produce dilation of coronary stenoses (6 +/- 12% to intravenous PGE1, difference not significant, 19 +/- 22% to intracoronary PGE1, p less than 0.05), but usually no change in the diameter of angiographically normal segments. In these patients intracoronary nitroglycerin consistently dilated the normal segments not altered with PGE1 and often led to further dilation of the stenoses. In 9 other patients who were undergoing coronary angioplasty, hemodynamics and the time to ischemia induced by coronary occlusion were measured. In both patient groups PGE1 led to decreases in aortic, pulmonary artery and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures and an increase in heart rate (all p less than 0.05). Before coronary occlusion PGE1 produced coronary vasodilation manifested by preservation in coronary sinus flow (130 +/- 41 to 126 +/- 42 ml/min, difference not significant); as aortic pressure declined coronary resistance decreased (0.9 +/- 0.3 to 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.05). During coronary occlusion residual flow to the affected region was usually similar to control occlusions (37 +/- 20 to 36 +/- 25 ml/min, difference not significant) and collateral resistance was decreased (3.2 +/- 2.9 to 2.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.05). However, time to ischemia usually remained unchanged. PGE1 shows an interesting angiographic and hemodynamic profile in patients with coronary artery disease. Although no obvious clinical benefit was seen, PGE1 was safely administered both intravenously and directly into narrowed coronary arteries.\r"

During a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, 16 new CAD cases were observed. After adjustment for age, sex, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking and body mass index, family history remained a highly significant predictor of future CAD (p = 0.0017). Only age was a more significant covariate (p = 0.0001) than family history. Sex (p = 0.00074) and serum total cholesterol (p = 0.015) also contributed significantly to CAD incidence while high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index and several interaction terms did not improve the prediction in this population. These results provide evidence for the existence of other heritable risk factors which appear to contribute strongly to the occurrence of early CAD in many high-risk families.\r"

Subjects were divided into 3 family history score groups (low, intermediate and high) and the effects of 60 potential risk variables were assessed using multiple stepwise discriminant analysis. After controlling for age effects, the variables entering the discriminant function equation (p less than 0.01) were cholesterol, years smoking cigarettes, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triceps skinfold thickness. Although normal blood pressure variation did not discriminate among family history groups, those with a positive family history of CAD were more likely to develop hypertension than those without a family history (age-adjusted relative risk 1.79, with 95% confidence limits 1.03 and 3.09). In spite of significant differences among family history score groups with regard to risk variables, the discriminant analysis classified only 39% of subjects into the correct group. It was concluded that other unknown risk variables must mediate the effects of family history of CAD. Thus, family history should be considered an independent risk factor for CAD.\r"

In the present study, detailed clinical assessments and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were performed prospectively on 100 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. HR variability was inversely correlated with HR (r = -0.38, p = 0.001), diabetes mellitus (r = -0.22, p = 0.025) and digoxin use (r = -0.29, p = 0.004), but not with left ventricular ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease or other clinical, electrocardiographic or angiographic variables. All patients were followed for 1 year. Major clinical events after initial discharge occurred in 10 patients and included 6 deaths and 4 coronary bypass operations. Left ventricular ejection fraction was the only variable that correlated with the occurrence of a clinical event (p = 0.002). Decreased HR variability and ejection fraction were the best predictors of mortality (both p less than 0.01), and the contribution of HR variability to mortality was independent of ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease and other variables. Furthermore, 11 patients with HR variability less than 50 ms had an 18-fold increase in mortality compared with patients with HR variability greater than 50 ms (36 vs 2%, p = 0.001). Thus, decreased HR variability is a potent independent predictor of mortality in the 12 months following elective coronary angiography in patients without recent myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of initially ineffective defibrillation pulses on subsequent defibrillation success is not known. Therefore, the voltage, current and energy at the defibrillation threshold were compared with the defibrillation rescue pulse voltage, current and energy that terminated ventricular fibrillation when an ineffective pulse just below the defibrillation threshold had been used initially. This lower amplitude ineffective pulse was termed a \"subdefibrillation threshold\" pulse. The pulse that restored sinus rhythm after the subdefibrillation threshold pulse was delivered was termed the \"subdefibrillation threshold rescue pulse.\" This comparison was undertaken, intraoperatively, in 14 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors using a sequential-pulse catheter-patch defibrillation system. Each of the 14 patients required higher voltage, current, delivered energy and stored energy for defibrillation with the subdefibrillation threshold rescue pulse than with the defibrillation threshold pulse. The defibrillation threshold voltage was 451 +/- 127 volts compared with a subdefibrillation threshold rescue voltage of 585 +/- 147 volts (p less than 0.00002). The defibrillation threshold current was 5.5 +/- 2.4 amps compared with a subdefibrillation threshold rescue current of 7.2 +/- 2.7 amps (p less than 0.00001). Delivered and stored energies were 10.9 +/- 7.4 and 12.3 +/- 7.2J, respectively, for the defibrillation threshold pulse and were 17.6 +/- 9.4 J (p less than 0.00002) and 20.5 +/- 9.3 J (p less than 0.00005), respectively, for the subdefibrillation threshold rescue pulse. It is concluded that the risk of requiring considerably higher energies than anticipated for defibrillation must be incurred, should defibrillation fail because of an initially insufficient defibrillation pulse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was 64% at 6 months. Age, sex, prior episodes of AF, presence of mitral valve disease or magnitude of mitral valve gradient did not predict recurrence, but duration of AF was significantly longer in the failure group (p less than 0.01). Left atrial dimension greater than or equal to 45 mm had a positive predictive value of 66%, with a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 61%. Presence or magnitude of the A wave at 4 hours did not predict long-term success of cardioversion. Percent increase of the A wave from 4 to 24 hours less than 10% had the highest positive predictive value (80%) for recurrence of AF (sensitivity 71% and specificity 71%) and can be obtained in the immediate post-cardioversion period to better establish prognosis and adjust therapeutic regimens.\r"

The mean VT rate was 155 beats/min and the endocardial catheter mapping during VT showed the earliest activation site at the left ventricular lateral wall near the apex. In all patients, rapid pacing from the right ventricular outflow tract during VT resulted in constant fusion beats except for the last entrained beat (thus VT was entrained), while pacing from the right ventricular apex and from the earliest activation site failed to demonstrate entrainment. During entrainment from the right ventricular outflow tract (mean pacing rate 168 beats/min), conduction intervals from the pacing site to the earliest activation site (St-A interval) and to the right ventricular apex (St-B interval) were measured in 3 patients. The St-A intervals were 400, 410 and 440 ms and the St-B intervals were 80, 70 and 90 ms, respectively. A small dose of verapamil (1.0 mg) was administered during VT, which resulted in a decrease of VT rate by a mean of 23 beats/min. During entrainment from the right ventricular outflow tract the St-A interval was prolonged in all 3 patients while the St-B interval remained the same. In conclusion, the mechanism of this VT was best explained by reentry with an area of slow conduction. Verapamil slowed the rate of VT by prolonging conduction within the area of slow conduction. Tachycardia entrainment makes possible a selective examination of antiarrhythmic drug effect on the area of slow conduction within the reentry circuit of VT.\r"

All patients had been demonstrated to have paroxysmal AF that was refractory to medical therapy over a long period of time (mean 9 +/- 7 years). Patients performed a symptom-limited treadmill exercise test on the day before catheter ablation and 6 weeks after hospital discharge. Quality of life was measured using the physical dimension of the McMaster Health Index Questionnaire and the Psychological General Well-Being Index before and 6 weeks after ablation. There were no serious complications related to catheter ablation or permanent pacemaker implantation. All patients remain in complete AV block with a completely paced rhythm at a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 2 months. The McMaster Health Index scores increased from a mean of 0.69 +/- 0.20 before to 0.92 +/- 0.14 after ablation (p = 0.002). The mean Psychological General Well-Being score improved from 59.8 +/- 14.8 at baseline to 84.9 +/- 13.6 6 weeks after discharge (p = 0.001). Treadmill exercise duration increased from 6.4 +/- 4.6 to 9.9 +/- 2.6 minutes (p = 0.03) and correlated strongly with changes in functional capacity measured with the McMaster Health Index (r = 0.70, p = 0.03). These results suggest that catheter ablation of the AV junction and implantation of a rate-adaptive pace-maker significantly improve the quality of life and exercise capacity of patients with paroxysmal AF refractory to medical therapy.\r"

The first 2 groups were studied only in control conditions while the third group was restudied after a 20% reduction in LV mass index induced by a long-term antihypertensive treatment and after a 3-week washout period. A significant relation between fractional shortening and end-systolic stress was found in all instances. The slope of this correlation was higher in normotensives (-0.251) and in hypertensives without LV hypertrophy (-0.232) (both p less than 0.01) than in hypertensives with ventricular hypertrophy (-0.079). In this latter group, the slope increased after the reversal of LV hypertrophy (-0.230, p less than 0.01) and remained unchanged (-0.202) at the end of the washout period. No difference was detectable between the slopes obtained in these patients after reversal of LV hypertrophy, both with the antihypertensive treatment on and off, and those of normotensives and hypertensives without LV hypertrophy. Thus, LV hypertrophy attenuates the influence of changes in afterload on LV function. Reversal of LV hypertrophy restores a fractional shortening end-systolic stress relation quite comparable to that found both in normotensives and in hypertensives before the development of LV hypertrophy.\r"

In only 1 case of anomalous origin of the LMCA was the left circumflex coronary artery dominant, and in this case the anomaly also was fatal. The RCA (25 cases) arose either from behind the left coronary sinus (8 cases), above the left coronary sinus (5 cases), from above the right-left commissure (10 cases) or as a single ostium with the LMCA above the right-left commissure and left coronary sinus (2 cases). In 8 of these 25 cases the anomaly was fatal. In 7 cases of anomalous origin of the RCA, the left circumflex coronary artery was dominant and in no case was the anomaly clinically significant. In 1 case, both the RCA and left circumflex coronary artery were hypoplastic and the anomaly was fatal. Coronary dominance, not ostial shape, was useful in separating the clinically significant from the clinically insignificant anomalies.\r"

  ".W": "Resting left ventricular (LV) function was evaluated in 29 infants with isolated right ventricular (RV) outflow obstruction. Age-corrected cardiac index was significantly inversely correlated with the degree of obstruction (r = 0.59, p = 0.0001). Right ventricular hypertension resulted in septal displacement and altered LV geometry. The magnitude of RV outflow obstruction related closely to the degree of LV distortion. Septal displacement toward the LV free wall was associated with lower values for cardiac index, indexed LV end-diastolic volume, ejection fraction, ratio of early to atrial LV diastolic inflow and with a higher RV ejection fraction. The LV end-diastolic volume index and the ratio of early to atrial LV diastolic inflow correlated with the degree of obstruction and amount of septal displacement. Four infants evaluated during the development of supravalvar pulmonary stenosis demonstrated decreasing cardiac index during development of obstruction and significant increase in cardiac index after surgical relief. These findings indicate that significant RV outflow obstruction in infants is associated with a reversible alteration in LV function related to abnormal LV geometry and impaired LV diastolic filling.\r"

Fifteen of these 26 (58%) had greater than or equal to 1 clinical cardiac abnormalities: 6 had congestive heart failure or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or both, 4 had ventricular tachycardia (VT), 10 had electrocardiographic abnormalities and 4 had pericardial abnormalities. Of the 32 patients without myocarditis, 6 (19%) had pericardial or electrocardiographic abnormalities, or both, but none had congestive heart failure, LV dysfunction or VT. Overall, clinical cardiac abnormalities were found in 21 patients (36%). Patients with myocarditis had a significantly higher incidence of clinical cardiac abnormalities than patients without myocarditis (58 vs 19%, p less than 0.01). All patients with congestive heart failure, LV dysfunction or VT had myocarditis. Thus, serious clinical cardiac abnormalities were common in patients with AIDS and were associated with myocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in left ventricular (LV) meridional and circumferential end-systolic wall stress during isometric and isotonic exercises were determined noninvasively in 12 healthy subjects using echocardiography and cuff blood pressure measurements. Isometric exercise was performed at 20 and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction using a handgrip dynamometer, and isotonic exercise was done on a cycle ergometer at 150 kpm/min increments every 3 minutes to a maximum of 600 kpm/min. Although the increase in systolic blood pressure was similar in both forms of exercise, LV systolic stress in the circumferential and meridional planes increased markedly during isometric exercise but decreased slightly during higher intensity isotonic exercise. Isometric exercise also produced a significant decrease in fractional shortening, whereas isotonic exercise significantly increased fractional shortening. Wall stress and fractional shortening were linearly and inversely related, but isometric and isotonic exercise produced divergent and significantly different linear regressions. In normal subjects isometric exercise produces a significant increase in LV afterload that leads to a decrease in LV global function. In contrast, isotonic exercise causes an increase in LV global function, most likely from an unchanged or slight decrease in afterload associated with increased LV contractility from greater catecholamine release.\r"

However, some of these patients can perform limited exercise, which, if added, may provide useful information. Treadmill exercise combined with dipyridamole-thallium imaging was performed in 100 patients and results compared with those of 100 other blindly age- and sex-matched patients who received dipyridamole alone. Exercise began after completion of the dipyridamole infusion. Mean +/- 1 standard deviation peak heart rate (109 +/- 19 vs 83 +/- 12 beats/min, p less than 0.0001) and peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure (146 +/- 28/77 +/- 14 vs 125 +/- 24/68 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001) were higher in the exercise group compared with the nonexercise group. There was no difference in the occurrence of chest pain, but more patients in the exercise group developed ST-segment depression (26 vs 12%, p less than 0.0001). The exercise group had fewer noncardiac side effects (4 vs 12%, p less than 0.01) and a higher target (heart) to background (liver) count ratio (2.1 +/- 0.7 vs 1.2 +/- 0.3; p less than 0.01), due to fewer liver counts. There were no deaths, myocardial infarctions or sustained arrhythmias in either group. Combined treadmill exercise and dipyridamole testing is safe, associated with fewer noncardiac side effects, a higher target to background ratio and a higher incidence of clinical electrocardiographic ischemia than dipyridamole alone. Therefore, it is recommended whenever possible.\r"

The dinners consisted of single foods in two experiments and mixed meals containing several foods in the third. The differences between the observed glycemic responses to low- and high-GI dinners were predicted by their GIs. The glycemic responses to breakfast were significantly lower on mornings after low-GI dinners than after high-GI dinners. Eating, at dinner, foods with different fiber contents but the same GI had no effect on postbreakfast glycemia. We conclude that the GI predicts the difference between glycemic responses of mixed dinner meals; breakfast carbohydrate tolerance is improved when low-GI foods are eaten the previous evening.\r"

A model including age, Quetelet's index, current thiazide use, and 1,25-(OH)2D explained 37% of the variability in systolic blood pressure observations, of which 7% of variability was explained by 1,25-(OH)2D.

In theory, supplementation with 2000 IU (50 micrograms) vitamin D should have increased the calculated antirachitic activity of the milk in winter to the levels of unsupplemented mothers in September; however, responses varied widely among individuals.\r"

Definite carotenodermia was observed only in the five subjects who took 30 mg of purified beta-carotene daily. Carotenodermia was first noted between 25 and 42 d after supplementation and persisted from 14 to greater than 42 d posttreatment and was observed only after plasma total carotenoid levels exceeded 4.0 mg/L. These observations may be useful to investigators planning clinical trials with beta-carotene and to clinicians assessing the significance of carotenodermia in men taking beta-carotene supplements or following diets high in carotenoid-containing foods.\r"

The significant decline (364 kJ, or 87 kcal) between these two 10-d intervals was smaller than but consistent with findings from previous studies of data from food journals. In a separate analysis with time-series techniques, two distinct periods of elevated intake were identified (during the midluteal and midfollicular phases) that were independent of illness and menstrual symptoms. This pattern of food intake is discussed with reference to normal hormonal fluctuations. These findings confirm that menstrual cycle is a potential confounding variable that should be controlled in research on human food intake.\r"

The effect was observed in lipoprotein (total cholesterol: 120.2 +/- 8.8) and lipoprotein-free (total cholesterol: 85.4 +/- 5.1) fractions with molecular weight greater than 100,000. The human milk fraction with molecular weight greater than 100,000 was also the most active in promoting [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in fetal aorta. Although milk stimulated the incorporation of [14C] oleate into triglycerides (control: 38.8 +/- 2.5%, milk: 82.1 +/- 4.2%), decreased incorporation to phospholipids (control: 55.0 +/- 3.0%, milk: 11.3 +/- 1.8%) was observed.

Cholesterol, saturated fatty acid, and monounsaturated fatty acid intake were decreased and the polyunsaturated fatty acid content was moderately increased. This kind of dietary change was achieved without changing the usual intake of meats, dairy products, fish, and eggs. As the amount of fat was decreased, carbohydrates in the form of grains, fruits, and vegetables were increased, providing an improvement in the vitamin and mineral content of the diet. Vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, B-6, B-12, and folates increased in the 25 en % diet. Potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, and copper intake also increased when the dietary fat decreased.\r"

Higher intakes of animal fats and saturated fatty acids and lower intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids and linoleic acid were documented in group A than in group B. Elderly subjects exhibited decreased 18:2 omega 6 and 20:4 omega 6 in serum phospholipids and triglycerides. Other indicators of essential fatty acid status in group A differed from group B in the direction of deficiency (double-bond index [DBI], 0.93 +/- 0.01 vs 1.13 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.001; total omega 6, 25.07 +/- 0.46% vs 32.49 +/- 0.89%, p less than 0.001).

Ileostomy effluent was collected over 24 h and the dose of lipid ingested was related to lipid output and to intestinal transit time. The coefficient of variation for mouth-to-stoma transit was less than 12%. The slopes of the least-square lines relating lipid ingested to lipid output and to mouth-to-stoma transit time were positive and significantly different (p less than 0.05) from 0. The ileostomate's small intestine absorbed linolenic acid with 98% efficiency. A delay in mouth-to-ileum transit, associated with increasing lipid loads, is one obvious mechanism that maintains the intestine's absorptive efficiency.\r"

One supplement was given during each of three 6-wk periods. Equivalent amounts of omega-3 FAs (6.8 g/d) were provided by each of the omega-3 treatments. Plasma cholesterol (C) levels were unchanged during the two omega-3 phases whereas plasma TG levels fell by 44% during both. Low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels rose significantly with both omega-3-FA treatments, as did apolipoprotein B levels.

A stable-isotope-tracer infusion study was then conducted for 5 h while subjects received an intragastric infusion of the test diet.

A final infusion study was conducted in subjects in the postabsorptive state after an additional 2 d with the 10-mg diet. Estimates were made of leucine flux and oxidation, rates of uptake and release of absorbed leucine by the splanchnic region, and leucine balance. The rate of appearance of dietary leucine in the systemic circulation (Leud) decreased (p less than 0.01) between the 40- and 10-mg diets. At the latter intake, splanchnic uptake was approximately 37% of absorbed leucine. The correlation between Leud and plasma leucine concentration was highly positive. A leucine intake of approximately 40 mg. kg-1.d-1 was close to that required to maintain leucine balance under these conditions.\r"

Since previous investigations have shown that S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is effective in antagonizing ICP, we wondered whether its administration to subjects with previous ICP could 1) protect them from a challenge with ethynylestradiol (EE) or 2) normalize the cholesterol saturation index (CSI). To test the first hypothesis, six women volunteered to receive EE (0.1 mg/day orally for 1 wk) and, after 3 months, the same EE dose plus oral SAMe (800 mg/day for 1 wk). EE significantly increased serum values of transaminases, conjugated bilirubin, and total bile acids with respect to basal values. In the rechallenge with EE plus SAMe, liver function tests did not differ from basal levels and were significantly lower than the values obtained after EE. In the second experiment, we gave oral SAMe (800 mg/day for 2 wk) to seven women with previous ICP who exhibited cholesterol supersaturation of duodenal bile. Both subjects were nonpregnant and nonobese and had cholecystograms negative for gallstones. Bile CSI decreased from a basal value of 1.35 +/- 0.07 to 0.98 +/- 0.08 after SAMe (p less than 0.01). These findings indicate that SAMe protects women with previous ICP from EE-induced liver toxicity and normalizes bile CSI in the same subjects who secrete lithogenic bile. The data support the belief that SAMe acts as a physiological antidote against estrogen hepatobiliary toxicity in susceptible women.\r"

The distinguishing light microscopic features in the first group are epithelial meganucleosis, lack of mitotic activity, and patchy fibroblastic proliferation in the lamina propria. The blood vessels appear normal. In the second group, there are severe vascular changes characterized by narrowing of the arterioles by subintimal fibrosis, telangiectasia of capillaries and post-capillary venules, endothelial degeneration, and platelet thrombi formation. These vascular changes are always associated with severe fibrosis of the lamina propria and crypt distortion.

This report describes a patient with stage IIIB Hodgkin's disease who received dexamethasone on three occasions for symptoms of spinal cord compression.

To determine how reduced renal function affects the drug's antihypertensive efficacy and safety, we studied 26 patients with hypertension associated with impaired renal function, having glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) of 60 ml/minute or less. These patients were enrolled in an open trial of 12 weeks' duration. They were given single daily doses of lisinopril, starting with 2.5 mg in patients with a GFR of less than 30 ml/minute, and 5 mg in the other patients. The dose was titrated to a maximum of 40 mg daily according to the blood pressure response. A diuretic was then added if required. Mean sitting and standing blood pressures at four, eight, and 12 weeks of treatment were significantly reduced compared with pretreatment values. The median dose of lisinopril was 10 mg daily (range, 2.5 to 40 mg), and only four patients required the addition of a diuretic. The mean GFR was unchanged during the study (36 +/- 16.4 ml/minute at baseline, 39 +/- 20.8 ml/minute after 12 weeks of treatment). Twenty-five patients completed the study. The one patient withdrew because of nausea and vomiting due to reflux esophagitis, which was probably not drug-related. Another patient had transient angioneurotic edema and continued to receive lisinopril. No clinically significant hematologic or biochemical abnormalities were observed. Sixteen patients continued to receive lisinopril for one year. Blood pressure control and GFR were well maintained throughout. Thus, in a group of patients who are often difficult to treat, lisinopril provided highly effective blood pressure control and was generally well tolerated.\r"

Mean glomerular filtration rate at entry was 61.6 +/- 3.4 ml/minute and was unchanged after 12 weeks of therapy at 62.2 +/- 3.0 ml/minute. Fourteen patients continued to receive lisinopril for a period of one year. Blood pressure remained controlled throughout and heart rate remained unchanged. There was a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure from 128.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg to 105.1 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Biochemical parameters remained unaltered. There was a significant increase in renal blood flow (p less than 0.025) and a corresponding reduction in renovascular resistance (p less than 0.001) following long-term therapy with lisinopril. Thus, lisinopril was generally well-tolerated and highly effective in lowering blood pressure in older hypertensive patients, whereas at the same time renal function was not adversely changed.\r"

Lisinopril treatment led to a significant improvement in both bicycle and treadmill exercise tolerance, New York Heart Association classification status, cardiac function assessed noninvasively, and symptomatology. There was no age differentiation; the same improvement was achieved in the 35 patients over 65 years old as in the younger patients. There was a mild decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving lisinopril, peaking at seven hours. These changes, however, were not significantly different from those seen with placebo. Apart from one patient in whom hypotension developed followed by reversible renal failure, there were no serious adverse effects, and the incidence of sudden death and biochemical abnormalities was no different from that seen with placebo. This study confirms that this agent is an effective, safe, well-tolerated agent in the treatment of congestive cardiac failure and is equally applicable to younger and older patients.\r"

All subjects were followed biweekly from the third trimester of pregnancy through delivery with uterine and umbilical artery velocimetry, nonstress, tests, and hematocrit and blood pressure measurements. An abnormal systolic/diastolic ratio was defined as a value greater than or equal to 3. The incidence of abnormal systolic/diastolic ratios for uterine or umbilical arteries was significantly higher in pregnant women with SS hemoglobin (88%) when compared with patients with AS (7%) and AA (4%) hemoglobin. In addition, the abnormal systolic/diastolic ratios for both umbilical and uterine arteries are correlated with abnormal nonstress test results. The nonstress test results became abnormal on average 3 weeks after the systolic/diastolic ratios did. The presence of abnormal systolic/diastolic ratios for umbilical and uterine arteries is predictive of fetal distress and infants small for gestational age. The high incidence of concordant uterine and umbilical artery abnormal systolic/diastolic ratios in pregnant women with SS hemoglobinopathy, which were identified earlier than were abnormal nonstress results, suggests an important parameter in the monitoring of these high-risk pregnancies.\r"

  ".U": "88338628\r", 
  ".W": "Postterm antenatal fetal surveillance has traditionally begun at 42 completed weeks of gestation. However, recent data have shown that a significant percentage of cases of perinatal asphyxia occurs between 40 and 42 weeks of gestation. We compared the perinatal outcome of fetuses with antenatal surveillance beginning at 41 weeks to those starting at 42 weeks of gestation. The study groups consisted of 908 patients who began antenatal testing at 41 weeks and 352 who began testing at 42 weeks. Antenatal testing consisted of twice-weekly amniotic fluid assessments and nonstress tests (including evaluation for late and variable decelerations). Between 41 and 42 weeks, the group whose testing started at 41 weeks had an overall incidence of intrapartum fetal distress of 2.7%, no stillbirths, and no infants with major neonatal morbidity. Patients without antenatal testing who delivered between 41 to 42 weeks did not have a significantly increased incidence of fetal distress (3.3%; p = 0.07). However, this group had a significantly increased incidence of adverse outcomes (p less than 0.05), including three stillbirths and seven cases of major neonatal morbidity. Beyond 42 weeks, the group whose testing started at 41 weeks had a 2.3% overall incidence of fetal distress. This was significantly less (p less than 0.01) than the group whose testing started at 42 weeks (5.6%). Neither of the groups had any stillbirths or infants with major neonatal morbidity. These findings suggest that starting antenatal testing at 41 weeks of gestation may result in decreased postterm perinatal mortality and morbidity as well as a decreased incidence of intrapartum fetal distress.\r"

Although some of the errors are due to biologic variability among fetuses, some may be due to variability of reading the test. The purpose of the present study was to assess the reliability and reproducibility of nonstress test readings. Fifty nonstress test monitor strips were read by five perinatologists on two occasions, for a total of 500 readings. Nonstress tests were read as reactive, equivocal, nonreactive, or technically unsatisfactory. Of the 50 tracings, only 11 had identical readings on all 10 occasions, and readers had different readings for the first and second readings 28% of the time. Estimates of interobserver and intraobserver agreement ranged from 0.41 to 0.55. These results indicate that there is considerable interobserver and intraobserver variability that can be expected to have a serious adverse effect on the sensitivity of the nonstress test.\r"

Reverse end-diastolic flow velocity during end diastole suggests extreme abnormality in waveform and resistance. We reviewed our experience of patients showing reverse end-diastolic flow velocity over a 2 1/2-year period. Out of 550 high-risk patients studied with umbilical velocimetry over this period, 12 patients showed the finding. All patients were delivered of small for gestational age fetuses and the perinatal mortality in this group was 50%. There was also significant perinatal morbidity as judged by cesarean section performed because of fetal distress, low Apgar scores, days in neonatal intensive care, prematurity, placental infarcts, and lethal anomalies. These findings suggest that reverse end-diastolic velocity on umbilical velocimetry is associated with catastrophic perinatal outcome, and aggressive perinatal management may be advised in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of 174 consecutive singleton perinatal deaths at or after term pregnancy in an inner-city hospital was undertaken to determine avoidable causes of death. Adequate material was available in 161 cases. Twenty-eight infants with major malformations were excluded. The remaining 133 infants (95 stillbirths and 38 neonatal deaths) constituted the study population. An avoidable cause was defined as departure from the recognized standards of perinatal care that contributed to the deaths. Avoidable factors were present in 69 of 95 (73%) stillbirths. Contributing maternal/social and obstetric factors were present in 40 of 69 (58%) and 29 of 69 (42%) cases, respectively. Avoidable factors were found in 34 of 38 (89%) neonatal deaths. Contributing obstetric, maternal/social, and pediatric factors were present in 20 of 34 (59%), 12 of 34 (35%), and 2 of 34 (6%) cases, respectively. These results suggest that maternal/social causes were present more often than medical causes as a contributing factor in avoidable perinatal deaths at or after term pregnancy.\r"

Analysis of the frequency distribution of instantaneous fetal heart rate values during Doppler measurements suggested that the decrease in umbilical peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratio was due to fetal tachycardia rather than a change in the placental vascular resistance. The uterine artery peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratio was not altered after vibratory acoustic stimulation.\r"

Antibiotics were administered during labor rather than after cord clamping if delivery was not imminent. Although endometritis developed more frequently in the patients receiving antibiotics after cord clamping, the difference was not statistically significant (5.6% versus 3.9%, difference not significant). There were two cases of verified sepsis in the group of infants (35 weeks) born to mothers receiving intrapartum antibiotics and there were eight cases in the no antibiotics group (p = 0.06). More importantly, in neonates greater than or equal to 35 weeks' gestational age, there was a significant difference in the frequency of positive blood cultures for group B streptococci (0/133 versus 8/140, p less than 0.05). We conclude that administration of antibiotics to the mother during labor may result in a decreased incidence of neonatal sepsis.\r"

Parturition was markedly inhibited in the diltiazem-treated group, based on the time to delivery of the first and subsequent fetuses and the number of fetuses undelivered at the end of each study. A significant decline in maternal blood pressure was observed in the diltiazem-treated group, but no significant change in maternal heart rate occurred. These findings suggest that diltiazem may provide significant tocolysis without the reflex tachycardia that has been observed with other calcium antagonists. Further evaluation of the maternal and fetal cardiovascular effects of diltiazem as well as the establishment of lower effective tocolytic doses are warranted.\r"

The first year of our trial of ambulatory tocodynamometry in 157 women at risk of preterm labor did not reveal significant differences in rates of preterm labor and preterm delivery between two groups of women randomly assigned to receive preterm labor education, frequent (5 days/week) telephone contact, and self-palpation of uterine activity (group EP), or to preterm labor education, daily telephone contact, and the Term Guard ambulatory uterine activity monitor (group EM). We report results from the second year (n = 152), yielding a total study population of 309. Forty-three subjects were later excluded, producing 266 subjects who completed the study. Comparison of preterm labor and preterm delivery rates, mean birth weight, and gestational age at delivery revealed no significant differences between the groups for the second year or for the combined data from both years of the study. Interestingly, comparison of all subjects enrolled in year 1 with all those enrolled in year 2 reveals significant decreases in the rates of both preterm labor and preterm delivery. Frequent attention to symptoms and signs of preterm labor, and improved patient and physician education and awareness, may be responsible for this decline in preterm labor and delivery in high-risk pregnancies.\r"

There was a significant rise in urine output from a mean (+/- SD) of 21 +/- 10 to 43 +/- 23 ml/hr, accompanied by a rise in cardiac output from 6.8 +/- 1.8 to 8.0 +/- 2.3 L/min (p less than or equal to 0.05). There were no significant changes in blood pressure, central venous pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The fractional excretion of sodium, negative free water clearance, and osmolar clearance tended to rise during dopamine therapy. No adverse maternal or fetal effects occurred. We conclude that low-dose dopamine produces a significant increase in urine production with resolution of oliguria in severe preeclampsia.\r"

All pregnant steroid-treated patients developing diabetes mellitus began steroid therapy after conception, whereas none of the patients receiving steroid therapy before conception developed glucose intolerance (p = 0.012). There does not appear to be an additive effect of steroid treatment and pregnancy on glucose intolerance; however, all patients receiving steroids should undergo periodic glucose screening.\r"

  ".W": "Placental culture models have been used to increase the understanding of endocrinology and pathophysiology in pregnancy. This article describes glucose and lipid metabolism in several of these models. Of special interest is the availability of arachidonic acid for the production of prostanoids. Ten placentas were collected at the time of cesarean section in term pregnancies without labor. Minced villous tissue was incubated for 48 hours in media with a glucose concentration of 100, 200, or 500 mg/dl. Tissue was dispersed in the media or was left as a single clump during the incubation. Glucose levels in the culture media were measured at 8, 20, 32, and 48 hours. Tissue lipid levels were measured before and after incubation in seven placentas. At 8 hours, glucose utilization ranged from 2.38 +/- 0.40 to 9.44 +/- 1.22 mumol/gm tissue/hr (mean +/- SEM). By 48 hours the cumulative glucose utilization ranged from 1.56 +/- 0.09 to 6.87 +/- 0.38 mumol/gm tissue/hr. Tissue lipid analysis showed most of the fatty acids to be in the phospholipids initially (4477 +/- 179 micrograms/gm tissue). Subsequent to incubation for 48 hours, phospholipid levels fell to a range of 2686 +/- 90 to 3466 +/- 157 micrograms/gm tissue in various culture conditions (p less than 0.005 compared with initial values). Whereas phospholipid levels decreased during incubation, levels of triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids increased significantly in placental tissue. Arachidonic acid, the precursor of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin, makes up about one quarter of the fatty acid in the initial placental phospholipid. Arachidonic acid follows the pattern of total fatty acids during incubation; it is released from phospholipid and is converted to nonesterified fatty acid and triglyceride. We may conclude from this study that each placenta has a unique glucose utilization rate and a unique capacity to produce triglyceride. In tissue culture, arachidonic acid is released to its nonesterified state much more quickly than it can be converted to prostanoids by cyclooxygenase. The choice of initial glucose concentration, tissue preparation (dispersed in media or left as single clump), and time of incubation all may determine the rate of glucose metabolism, the rate of phospholipid breakdown, the rate of triglyceride production, and the quantity of nonesterified arachidonic acid in placental tissue culture.\r"

A total of 103 patients had a prior cesarean section for either failure to progress or cephalopelvic disproportion. On the basis of the maximum cervical dilatation in the prior labor, the patients were categorized into three groups: 0 to 5 cm, 6 to 9 cm, and 10 cm. The success rates for vaginal delivery of 61%, 80%, and 69%, respectively, were not significantly different among groups (p = 0.31). When arrest of labor was not the indication for primary cesarean section, 78% of the patients were subsequently delivered of their infants vaginally. This was not significantly different from the 70% overall success rate achieved by the group with failure to progress or cephalopelvic disproportion (p = 0.17). Similarly, when the success rate for a trial of labor was plotted against neonatal birth weight, the trends were comparable in the groups with and without failure to progress or cephalopelvic disproportion. These data suggest that patients with a prior cesarean section for arrest of labor are good candidates for a trial of labor and that the cervical dilatation previously reached does not determine the likelihood of success.\r"

Baseline fetal heart rate, number of accelerations, and variability were assessed before and after transfusion in both groups. Whereas there were no changes after transfusion in the former group, those fetuses who received pancuronium bromide demonstrated a dramatic abolishment of accelerations and decrease in variability, with the heart rate pattern often appearing \"sinusoidal-like.\" These alterations in fetal heart rate were temporary changes that reverted to normal once the fetus \"awakened\" from the neuromuscular blockade. We speculate that these changes in fetal heart rate are secondary to the interaction of the reported hypertensive and vagolytic effects of pancuronium bromide.\r"

Patients in the labetalol group received 20 mg of labetalol intravenously followed by 10 mg increments up to a total dose of 1 mg/kg, which resulted in moderate reductions in the maternal mean arterial pressure and heart rate with attenuation of the hypertensive and tachycardiac responses to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. In the labetalol group there was no excessive reduction in the mean arterial pressure with the use of isoflurane and the usual amount of blood loss that occurred during cesarean section. The neonatal Apgar scores and umbilical arterial and venous pH and blood gas values were similar in the two groups. Side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoglycemia were not seen in the neonates in the labetalol treatment group.\r"

Amniotic fluid was retrieved from 20 women in active labor and from 20 women not in labor. Patients were matched for maternal age and gestational age. Estradiol, estriol, progesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured in amniotic fluid by radioimmunoassay. For women in active labor, the median concentrations (range) of these steroid hormones were 2.4 ng/ml (1 to 9.2 ng/ml), 1661.2 ng/ml (556.6 to 3928.1 ng/ml), 12.3 ng/ml (4.7 to 41.4 ng/ml), and 187.5 ng/ml (61.2 to 470 ng/ml), respectively. The median concentrations (range) for women not in labor were 1.6 ng/ml (0.3 to 5.7 ng/ml), 684.2 ng/ml (70.6 to 2103.1 ng/ml), 13.2 ng/ml (7.5 to 63 ng/ml), and 65.6 ng/ml (20 to 334 ng/ml), respectively. Thus spontaneous human parturition at term was associated with significantly increased amniotic fluid concentrations of estradiol, estriol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (p = 0.02, p = 0.002, p = 0.003, respectively). The progesterone/estrogen ratios (progesterone/estradiol and progesterone/estriol) were significantly lower for women in active labor compared with those not in labor (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0006, respectively). We conclude that a local change in the progesterone/estrogen ratio occurs during human parturition at term.\r"

Two hundred and thirty consecutive patients were admitted with premature rupture of the membranes to Yale-New Haven Hospital from January 1985 to July 1987. Amniotic fluid was retrieved by amniocentesis from 96% (221/230). Sixty-one patients were in labor on admission (27.6%, 61/221) and 39% of them (24/61) had a positive amniotic fluid culture. Patients in labor on admission were more likely to have a positive amniotic fluid culture than those who were not in labor on admission (24/61 versus 41/160, p = 0.049). Of the 160-patients who were not in labor on admission, 81 subsequently went into spontaneous labor; microbiologic information at the time of labor was known in 48 of these patients (59.2%). Seventy-five percent (36/48) of these patients had a positive amniotic fluid culture. The incidence of intraamniotic infection in quiescent women who subsequently went into labor was higher than that of patients admitted in active labor (75% versus 39%, p = 0.0004). These results provide a basis for the clinical impression that the onset of labor in women with preterm premature rupture of the membranes is associated with a subclinical intraamniotic infection. The mechanisms responsible for the onset of labor in women without an intraamniotic infection may be associated with an extraamniotic infection (e.g., deciduitis) or a noninfectious process.\r"

  ".W": "Our hypothesis is that systemic tocolysis of patients in premature labor is associated with a higher incidence of pulmonary edema in the presence of maternal infection. Over a 64-month period, medical records of all patients with a diagnosis at discharge of pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure were reviewed. There were 27 cases of pulmonary edema, 16 of which (59.3%) were associated with treatment of preterm labor. The incidence of pulmonary edema in patients receiving systemic tocolysis for treatment of preterm labor was significantly higher than that in our general obstetric population (3.04% versus 0.05%). Of the 527 patients receiving tocolysis, there was evidence of maternal infection in 52. The incidence of pulmonary edema was higher in the presence of maternal infection than in its absence (11/52 or 21% versus 5/475 or 1%, p = 0.0000). We conclude that there is a very strong association between the development of pulmonary edema and the presence of maternal infection in patients being treated for premature labor with systemic tocolysis.\r"

During this period a total of 55 trachelectomies were performed. Fifty-three of the 55 trachelectomies (96%) were performed by the vaginal approach. Forty-seven of the 55 patients (85%) had symptomatic genital prolapse as an indication for trachelectomy. Only seven of the patients had trachelectomy performed as a lone surgical procedure, whereas 48 of the 55 patients (87%) had additional surgical procedures performed at the time of trachelectomy. The most frequently performed concomitant operation was anterior and posterior colporrhaphy. Trachelectomy is an operation that should be performed only when clear indications exist and not on a prophylactic basis. With the use of sound surgical technique, trachelectomy can be performed with very acceptable morbidity. A technique for vaginal trachelectomy is described.\r"

Either intravenous magnesium sulfate or oral terbutaline was administered at the time of presentation. Intensive surveillance to detect signs of infection was carried out for all patients. In 29 of the patients in this treatment group who were seen at less than 34 weeks, a significantly longer prolongation of pregnancy was achieved when compared with 24 similar women treated after onset of labor in the hospital (169 hours versus 77 hours, p = 0.05). Duration of infant hospitalization was less for those mothers receiving tocolytic agents before labor. Maternal and infant infection were not different in the two groups; nor was the cesarean section rate. When this treatment group was compared with another control group of 96 women already in labor at presentation, the difference in time from admission to delivery was substantial, but it did not achieve statistical significance. In this group the rate of maternal infection was significantly higher, but newborn morbidity was not. Aggressive early treatment with tocolytic agents in pregnant women with preterm premature membrane rupture is more productive but not more dangerous than conservative management.\r"

The mean age at the time of the most recent delivery was 27 years. Cases attributable to the single risk factor of heterosexual transmission acounted for 76% of the cumulative number. Twenty-eight, or 56%, of the total sample were of Haitian ancestry. The patients in this study group did experience several complications of pregnancy. Interestingly, more than one third of the pregnancy courses (34.6%) were complicated by preterm labor. Only 15.4% of the patients had premature rupture of membranes. A higher rate of infection of the genitourinary tract and an increased incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in women known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus are suggested. Less clear is the contribution of genitourinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases to the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus transmission. Although a total of 10 patients in the study group were known to have children infected with human immunodeficiency virus, only longitudinal studies of the children of the mothers in this group will shed light on the number of children who ultimately become infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Similarly, although the majority of patients in this report remained asymptomatic during the course of their pregnancies, a matched, controlled study is necessary to confirm that pregnancy does not accelerate the progression of human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

An oral 50 gm, 1-hour glucose challenge test was done 48 hours after terbutaline dosing began. All abnormal glucose challenge test results (greater than or equal to 135 mg/dl) were followed by a standard 100 gm oral glucose tolerance test. Sixty-three percent (54 of 86) of the terbutaline group had an abnormal 1-hour screening result, which was significantly different than the 26.7% (23 of 86) observed in the control group (p less than 0.001). The mean fasting blood sugar and 1-hour postchallenge values were significantly higher in the study than in the control group (p less than 0.0001). Ten of 86 in the treated group (11.6%) and 2 of 86 in the control group (2.3%) with abnormal results met the criteria for gestational diabetes. These numbers achieve statistical significance at p less than 0.05. This study shows a significant effect of oral terbutaline therapy on glucose tolerance during pregnancy. Patients receiving oral terbutaline therapy for suppression of preterm labor should undergo screening for gestational diabetes.\r"

There were 100 neonates less than 1500 gm, equally divided between groups I and II with respect to gestational age, birth weight, race, sex, presentation, route of delivery, duration of labor, Apgar scores, and arterial umbilical cord acid-base balance. The antenatal use of vitamin K resulted in significant reduction in the prothrombin time (12.7 versus 15.2 seconds) and partial thromboplastin time (42.6 versus 58.9 seconds; p less than 0.05). Furthermore, group I experienced a lower incidence of total (16% versus 36%) and severe (0% versus 11%) grades of intraventricular hemorrhage (p less than 0.05).

Vision improved in all patients over a period ranging from nine days to nine months. In five patients, visual acuity returned to within two Snellen lines of the pretreatment level.\r"

A mean (+/- S.E.M.) of 65 +/- 3 burns (range, 50 to 115) were given during the initial laser trabeculoplasty, and 58 +/- 2 burns (range, 36 to 100) were given during the first repeat treatment. Three months after the first repeat laser trabeculoplasty, one eye (3%) had undergone filtering surgery and 30 eyes (78%) were considered successes. Of the 30 eyes that were followed up for 12 months after the first repeat laser trabeculoplasty, two (7%) had undergone filtering surgery, three (10%) had received a second repeat laser trabeculoplasty, and 22 (73%) were successes. Fifteen eyes underwent a second repeat laser trabeculoplasty at six to 47 months (mean +/- S.E.M., 21 +/- 3 months) after the first repeat laser trabeculoplasty. Seven (47%) of these eyes required filtering surgery within three to 12 months after the second repeat laser trabeculoplasty. Four of 38 (11%) of the initial, two of 38 (5%) of the first repeat, and zero of 15 of the second repeat laser trabeculoplasty treatments resulted in a one- to two-hour rise in intraocular pressure of at least 10 mm Hg.\r"

A total of 24,332 \"trees\" were completed by parents and students in 37 high schools in 14 urban and rural communities in Texas and Utah during the years 1980-86. Completed \"trees\" were obtained from 68 per cent of all enrolled students. High-risk families, included 1,796 families with early coronary disease (7.5 per cent of all student families or 3.7 per cent of their parents' families), 870 stroke families (3.6 per cent), and 415 cancer prone families (1.7 per cent). Among these 3,081 high-risk families there were 8,245 family members already reported to have been diagnosed by a physician to have the familial disease of interest and 43,269 high risk unaffected siblings and offspring of these persons. The average cost per identified high-risk unaffected person was under $10. We conclude that the \"Health Family Tree\" is a feasible and cost-effective way to find high-risk families.\r"

The overall increase throughout the month and difference in the magnitude of increase between Upstate and New York City corresponds to the timing of income maintenance benefits distribution. Distribution of most public assistance benefits occurs at the beginning of each month in Upstate, whereas it is staggered in New York City throughout the month.\r"

Using a case-control design, we compared the method of delivery of all infants with low (0-6) five-minute Apgar scores born to multiparous mothers after uncomplicated pregnancies and births to that of similar infants with a high score (7-10), frequency matched by birthweight. Of the 1,030 infants with low Apgar score, 127 (12.3 per cent) were delivered via repeat cesarean section, in contrast to 98 (9.8 per cent) of 998 controls with high Apgar score. In a regression model controlling for birthweight, gestational length, maternal age, and income the relative risk was 1.29 (95% confidence interval 0.97, 1.72). Excess risk was highest among babies of normal (2500-4000 grams) birthweight. While a number of limitations inherent in the source of data require cautious interpretation of these results, we conclude that some excess risk of low Apgar score may be associated with repeat cesarean section procedures.\r"

The present analyses extend the classes and years to 1986, and the age range to 18-28. A cohort-sequential design is employed, based on annual surveys of nationally representative samples of high school seniors, plus annual follow-up surveys of each senior class. Twelve different classes of drugs, both licit and illicit, are examined. Several different types of period, age, and cohort effects over the last decade are identified. Alcohol use (monthly and occasions of heavy use), and the use of marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, methaqualone, barbiturates, LSD, psychedelics other than LSD, and tranquilizers all showed period effects. Occasions of heavy drinking, cigarette smoking, monthly and daily use of alcohol, and annual prevalence of cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, LSD, and narcotics other than heroin showed age effects. Class effects were seen for cigarette smoking and daily marijuana use.\r"

After adjusting for age and poverty status, there were clear differences in the proportions of women 20 per cent or more overweight among Black, Hispanic and other White women (35, 26 and 20 per cent, respectively). Black women were less likely than White women to perceive themselves as overweight when categorized by actual weight relative to ideal weight; however, within categories of weight relative to other women of the same ethnic group, all women not Hispanic were equally likely to consider themselves overweight. There was no difference by ethnicity in the proportion of women trying to lose weight among those who perceived themselves as overweight. These findings have implications for programs designed to modify weight, since they suggest that women use ethnic-specific standards in assessing overweight.\r"

Four people had all their teeth extracted. Of the teeth present at baseline, 1.9 per cent subsequently were extracted. The highest incidence of tooth loss occurred among mandibular molars (3.7 per cent), followed by maxillary premolars and canines (3.1 per cent each). The best predictors of tooth loss were previous coronal and root caries.\r"

Five human plague cases were associated with five feline cases. Recommendations are presented for prevention of plague infection and transmission to humans, including restraining cats from roaming and hunting by neutering and keeping them indoors, treating them for fleas, and seeking medical care for febrile illnesses, especially when accompanied by enlarged lymph nodes.\r"

An age-adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) of 2.17 (95% CI-1.32, 3.56) was observed among workers with high demands, low control, and low social support compared to a low demand, high control, and high social support reference group. PRs of approximately 2.00 were observed in this group after consecutively controlling for the effects of age together with 11 other potential confounding factors. The magnitude of the age-adjusted PRs was greatest for blue collar males. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design, causal inferences cannot be made. The limitations of design and measurement are discussed in the context of the methodological weaknesses of the work stress field.\r"

Pseudocysts developed in 86 patients consequent to an episode of acute pancreatitis, and all 12 deaths (14 percent) were in this group. None of the remaining 14 patients whose pseudocysts were a feature of chronic pancreatitis died. Of the 81 patients in whom amylase levels were measured, 76 percent had an increased level.\r"

Although our recurrence rate after radical neck dissection was lower than that previously reported for surgery alone, it was still significantly higher than that after adjuvant radiotherapy. We conclude that histologically proved neck disease should be treated by radical neck dissection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to decrease recurrence and, it is hoped, improve survival.\r"

  ".W": "Seven men and 81 women were operated on for Graves' disease. Their median age was 33 years. Eleven patients underwent a bilateral subtotal lobectomy; 77 patients underwent a complete lobectomy with contralateral partial lobectomy. Forty-seven patients were treated before 1981. In these patients, the weight of the thyroid remnant was estimated empirically between 5 and 12 g. In the 41 patients treated since 1981, the remnant weight was estimated at 5 g by comparative weighing. There were no postoperative deaths. Functional results were established in 83 patients with an average follow-up of 50 months (range 12 to 156 months), with control of vocal cord mobility demonstrated by indirect laryngoscopy in 66 patients. Hormonal determinations were carried out in 74 patients. There were no cases of permanent hypoparathyroidism. Three patients (4.5 percent) had unilateral vocal cord dysfunction. Twelve patients (14.5 percent) had clinical and biologic hypothyroidism, which occurred within 1 year postoperatively in 11 cases. Seven patients (8.3 percent) had latent hypothyroidism only discovered by hormonal determinations. Fifteen patients (17.8 percent) had recurrent hyperthyroidism, 6 of whom were diagnosed by hormonal determinations. The actuarial recurrence rate increased progressively up to the sixth postoperative year. The only predictive factor for recurrence was the type of operation. Patients who underwent a bilateral subtotal lobectomy had more recurrences than patients who underwent a complete lobectomy with partial contralateral lobectomy (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that patients should be followed closely for many years and should undergo hormonal determinations regularly, as some recurrences can occur 5 years or more after operation with very few symptoms.\r"

The technique has been considerably modified, resulting in an operation that combines good access, sound oncologic resection with excellent cosmesis, and a low postoperative morbidity rate for conditions that have been associated hitherto with an extremely poor prognosis. A 9 year experience with 92 patients is presented. Long follow-up confirmed the initial results, suggesting an improved survival rate in patients with potentially curable disease. An increasing number of large benign tumors, which would previously have been considered inaccessible, are now being resected. Herein, the role and accuracy of preoperative investigations such as computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are evaluated, and the cosmetic implications associated with long-term survival, particularly in children, is considered. The many advantages of craniofacial resection recommend it as the treatment of choice for tumors of the nose and paranasal sinuses, and the versatility of the technique allows its application to tumors arising in adjacent areas.\r"

The effects of a medium-viscosity nutrient meal on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying were investigated. Motility was recorded with long-term implanted extraluminal strain gauge force transducers; gastric emptying was measured radiographically. Gastric emptying after Roux-Y gastrectomy was almost linear and not different from that in intact control dogs. In contrast to Roux-Y gastrectomy, emptying after Billroth I gastrectomy was initially accelerated and followed by a slow emptying phase. During the initial period, the segmenting activity of the Roux-Y limb significantly differed from the propulsive contractile pattern of the duodenum after Billroth I reconstruction. Force and frequency of gastrointestinal contractions were equivalent after both reconstruction procedures. Results indicate that after subtotal gastrectomy, the intestinal contractile patterns are important determinants of gastric emptying. They are the main causes for the different emptying patterns of viscous nutrient meals.\r"

This method of decompression has allowed us to perform colonic resection in all patients with toxic megacolon seen in recent years. It is desirable to remove the infected and inflamed colon in such a circumstance. We have not resorted to blowhole colostomies in cases of toxic megacolon, as this leaves the colon, which is the septic source, within the abdominal cavity. This technique has also been used successfully to expedite subtotal colectomy and ileosigmoid anastomosis in patients with obstructing lesions of the left side. It allows colonic decompression and on-table bowel preparation by irrigation with antiseptics such as povidone-iodine (Betadine).\r"
