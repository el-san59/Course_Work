  ".W": "It has recently been proposed that sequence variation in the gene coding for tissue kallikrein might be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. However, molecular evidence of an association between a sequence alteration in the kallikrein gene family and the transmission of increased blood pressure has never been reported. In 32 recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and the normotensive Brown Norway rat (BN), we investigated whether a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marking the kallikrein gene family cosegregated with blood pressure. In the RI strains that inherited the kallikrein RFLP from the SHR progenitor strain, the median systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were significantly greater than in the RI strains that inherited the kallikrein RFLP from the BN progenitor strain. These findings suggest that in the rat, sequence variation in the kallikrein gene family, or in closely linked genes, may have the capacity to affect blood pressure.\r"

He was one of the main early proponents of the idea that it was the raised intra-arterial pressure itself that caused many of the cardiac and vascular complications of hypertension. His training in both pharmacology and internal medicine enabled him to devise practical methods for successful treatment of hypertension with ganglion blocking drugs such as hexamethonium. The major clinical benefits that followed such drug treatment proved a great stimulus to the development of drugs with fewer disadvantages and to widespread acceptance of the beneficial effects of antihypertensive drug treatment.\r"

One patient had too extensive disease for surgery so 54 were treated by 55 spinal stabilisations; 49 obtained complete relief of pain and two had partial relief. There were three failures. Twenty-eight of the patients had clinical evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and were decompressed at the time of stabilisation. Of these, 20 had major recovery of neurological function. Patients with pre-operative evidence of extradural tumour had 'prophylactic' decompression at the time of stabilisation; none of these patients later developed signs of cord or cauda equina compression. The results suggest that alleviation of pain and restoration of mobility are best achieved by segmental spinal stabilisation; a few patients require a combined anterior and posterior stabilisation. Postoperative radiotherapy should be given whenever possible, and the causative tumour should be treated by endocrine or chemotherapy, as indicated.\r"

Intraosseous lipomatosis is a hamartomatous malformation due to hyperplasia of adipose tissue, and is fundamentally different from solitary benign intraosseous lipoma. Management involves reconstruction of any pathological fracture. Large progressive lesions should be treated by curettage and grafting in an attempt to prevent such fractures.\r"

The predicted daily personal noise exposure was calculated and the potential for hearing damage confirmed. Twenty-seven senior orthopaedic staff were then assessed by audiometry; evidence of noise-induced hearing loss was found in half the subjects. The increasing use of powered instruments in elective orthopaedics and fracture fixation may present a significant cumulative risk to the hearing of orthopaedic surgeons and theatre personnel. The use of ear defenders should be promoted, and manufacturers should be encouraged to develop instruments with lower noise emission levels.\r"

Twenty-seven patients had painful anterior atlanto-axial subluxation (AAS), nine had subaxial subluxation alone and two had severe cranial subluxation of the odontoid, one also with subaxial subluxation. One patient died from postoperative staphylococcal septicaemia and another 18 died during the follow-up period. Patients with coincident cardiac or other diseases, and those with cranial subluxation of the odontoid of more than 3 mm had an increased mortality. Neither the patients' age nor the magnitude of AAS correlated with mortality. Of the 37 patients with occipitocervical pain, 30 were relieved and all the six patients with tetraparesis were improved. Of the 24 Gallie fusions only 12 were solidly united; patients with long-term cortisone treatment were more likely to develop pseudarthrosis. There was no correlation between clinical outcome and radiological result. Four patients had further operations to treat subluxation which developed below the fused segments.\r"

In group 2, 28 patients had lumbar fusions also including most of the lower curve. The magnitude of the lower curve and the correction obtained in traction were good indicators of the correction achieved postoperatively. Forty-four patients were reviewed at a minimum of 10 years after operation. Those in group 1 showed sustained improvement of the lower curve with minimal stiffness and pain. Group 2 patients had lumbar curves of similar severity at review, but had significantly more low back pain and stiffness. The number of lumbar segments which remained mobile appeared to be a critical factor in determining the outcome. Selective fusion of the upper curve in double major scoliosis produces satisfactory results if the lumbar curve is less than 50 degrees. It may also be appropriate for flexible lumbar curves of larger angle.\r"

Five feet had sustained an injury, tumours were found in three and there was no obvious cause in nine. In most cases in need of operative treatment, there was a space-occupying lesion. Classifying the results according to causes, those with coalition or a tumour fared better, and idiopathic and traumatic cases had a worse outcome.

In each case, the growth plate was vertical, the femoral head was displaced inferiorly and there were abnormalities in the metaphysis of the femoral neck.

However, in simulated stair climbing, the cemented components were much more stable than the uncemented components (76 microns as against 280 microns). There was also greater variation in the stability of uncemented components in simulated stair climbing, with two of the seven components moving 200 microns or more. Future implant designs should aim to improve the initial stability of cementless femoral components under torsional loads; this should improve the chances of bony ingrowth.\r"

Both titanium and polyethylene particles caused migration, adherence and phagocytosis of CD11b-positive, peroxidase-negative macrophages. There were no histological signs of activation of the specific immune response; neither interleukin-2 receptor-positive activated T cells nor PCA-1 plasmablasts/plasma cells were present in the tissues. In cases of simple loosening, resident mesenchymal fibroblast-like cells were active. In aggressive granulomatosis, there were many macrophages and multinucleated giant cells but little fibroblast reaction. The clinical relevance of the findings is that the use of cementless prostheses is not a guarantee against adverse tissue reactions.\r"

Cementless total hip arthroplasty was performed in 12 dogs, six had a low elastic modulus polyacetal resin stem and six had a high modulus stainless steel stem. The components were otherwise similar. At six and 12 months after operation, radiographic and histomorphometric analysis showed that those with steel implants had more cortical porosity than did the other group (p less than 0.01). We suggest that the elastic modulus of the implant is an important factor in controlling cortical bone resorption. A low modulus femoral prosthesis can significantly decrease bone resorption which might otherwise eventually lead to implant failure.\r"

In 46 rabbits the medial collateral ligaments were excised and replaced with carbon fibre prostheses. The animals were treated postoperatively by either continuous passive motion, cast immobilisation or cage activity, termed intermittent active motion. At six weeks, the ligaments were compared histologically and biomechanically with normal (control) medial collateral ligaments and with sham-operated controls. The ligaments treated with continuous passive motion were superior to those in the other two treatment groups. There were no ligament failures in any of the groups. This study suggests that continuous passive motion, initiated immediately postoperatively, enhances the biomechanical properties of carbon fibre ligament replacement of the medial collateral ligament while preventing the harmful effects of joint immobilisation.\r"

The subjects' perception of the position was recorded on a visual analogue model and compared with the actual angle of flexion. Eighty-one normal and 45 osteoarthritic knees were examined, as were 10 knees with semi-constrained and 11 with hinged joint replacements. All were assessed with and without an elastic bandage around the knee. There was a steady decline in joint position sense with age in subjects with normal knees. Those with osteoarthritic knees had impaired joint position sense at all ages (p less than 0.001). Knee replacement improved the joint position sense slightly (p less than 0.02); semi-constrained replacement had a greater effect than hinged replacement. The effect of an elastic bandage in subjects with poor position sense was dramatic, improving accuracy by 40% (p less than 0.001). It is proposed that reduced proprioception in elderly and osteoarthritic subjects may be responsible for initiation or advancement of degeneration of the knee.\r"

The natural articular surfaces of meniscal fibrocartilage provided excellent articular surfaces at all times. Equally good articular surfaces were restored by host tissue growth covering costal cartilage grafts at six months, but by 12 months this surface had degenerated. The majority of the allografts survived and integrated with the host at six months, but many showed signs of failure at 12 months. Only three out of seven ungrafted defects healed completely at six months and the healed surfaces were degenerating at 12 months.\r"

Most patients were female (88%), elderly (mean age 66 years) and had had severe polyarticular disease for a mean duration of 16 years. Over half had taken systemic corticosteroids, nearly all were severely osteopenic but few had rheumatoid changes in the hip. Of the 20 fractures treated by internal fixation 12 had complications including nonunion (5), osteonecrosis (5), infection (1), and intertrochanteric fracture (1). Only one of the nine undisplaced fractures required reoperation, but seven of the 11 displaced fractures had revision surgery. Twenty fractures were treated by primary total hip arthroplasty with only one early complication. The other 12 fractures had been treated by hemiarthroplasty (9), hip excision (1) or non-operatively (2). Our results suggest that, in elderly rheumatoid patients, severely displaced femoral neck fractures should be treated by total hip replacement.\r"

The mean intracapsular pressure was lower in the extracapsular fractures. In these, the mean intraosseous pressure in the femoral head was unchanged by aspiration of the joint. However in the intracapsular fractures aspiration produced a significant decrease in intra-osseous pressure and an increase in pulse pressure within the femoral head.

A plaster cast is applied in the operating room, and a pylon added one week later, after which full weight-bearing is allowed. We compared these patients with 27 who had soft bandaging. The 'healing' time was reduced from 98 days to 40 days, and there were no major complications in the plaster-pylon group. The technique is simple and cheap and can be used by paramedical staff without specialised training or equipment.\r"

Fractures with skin blisters or abrasions had more than double the overall complication rate. Fracture-dislocations had three times as many major complications as simple fractures, and those not fixed within 24 hours had a 44% major complication rate compared to 5.3% in those operated upon as emergencies. Patients transferred from another medical facility had high complication rates, especially if they had fracture-dislocations. We conclude that operative treatment of ankle fractures must be delivered in a timely fashion, especially in severe fractures. We would caution against the practice of transferring patients with serious ankle fractures before completion of definitive care.\r"

The design of rocker had no effect upon the kinematics of walking. However, using new criteria for kinetic assessment of rocker function (tibial floor angular velocity and centre of pressure progression), most designs had a deleterious effect on the biomechanics of gait. Only two rockers approached the ideal kinetic criteria.\r"

Excellent or good results were achieved in 33 ankles (82.5%), three had a fair result, and four were poor. The clinical results were matched by the radiographic results which showed significant talar tilt or anterior talar translation in only three ankles. The functional result showed no positive correlation with the stress-radiographic analysis. We concluded that this modification of the Evans operation gives satisfactory long-term results, which show little change from the good results at 24 to 35 months reported in an earlier paper from our department.\r"

  ".W": "Although abolishment of ovarian cyclicity by the use of a long-acting GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) provides effective treatment for premenstrual syndrome (PMS), its use is limited by sequellae of the resultant hypoestrogenism. In this study the effects of estrogen/progestin replacement on the symptomatic improvement afforded by GnRH-a were evaluated in eight women with severe PMS. The 8-month study design included 2 months of control, 2 months of GnRH-a alone, and 4 further months in which the exogenous steroids were replaced in randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over fashion using 1 month each of 1) conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) on days 1-25, 2) 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on days 16-25, 3) CEE (days 1-25) plus MPA (days 16-25), and 4) placebo alone. Mood and physical symptoms were measured daily on a valid and reliable instrument, the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences. As expected, administration of GnRH-a alone resulted in a 75% improvement in luteal phase symptom scores (17.8 +/- 4.8 vs. 4.2 +/- 1.6; P less than 0.01). Combined sequential administration of CEE and MPA in addition to GnRH-a was effective in maintaining the reduced symptom scores seen after GnRH-a alone and was superior to the addition of CEE alone, MPA alone, or placebo. This combination of CEE and MPA resulted in a 60% improvement (P less than 0.05) compared to the luteal phase of control months in both behavioral (14.1 +/- 3.9 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.8) and total (17.8 +/- 4.8 vs. 6.5 +/- 1.8) symptoms. We conclude that the undesirable consequence of ovarian steroid deficiency in the treatment of PMS by GnRH-a can be overcome by the addition of sequential estrogen and progestogen replacements without significantly reducing the effectiveness of GnRH-a in this disorder.\r"

  ".U": "91123315\r", 
  ".W": "To explore whether possible differences in central nervous system neuromodulators contribute to the differential presentation of affective symptomatology in Cushing's disease and major depression, we examined the levels of immunoreactive CRH and ACTH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 11 patients with Cushing's disease, a patient with ectopic ACTH secretion, 34 patients with major depression, and 60 healthy subjects. We elected to measure these peptides not only because both are classically involved in pituitary-adrenal regulation, but also because their primarily arousal-producing and anorexigenic behavioral effects in experimental animals suggest that they may play a role in the symptom complex of depressive syndromes. We also explored whether the CSF levels of these peptides were more helpful in determining the often difficult differential diagnosis between major depression and Cushing's disease than the plasma ACTH response to ovine CRH, a currently used but somewhat insensitive laboratory means of distinguishing these disorders. CSF levels of immunoreactive CRH and ACTH were significantly lower in Cushing's disease patients [21.9 +/- 2.7 and 15.4 +/- 1.8 pg/mL, (mean +/- SEM), respectively] compared to patients with major depression [38.4 +/- 2.3 pg/mL (P less than 0.01) and 24.5 +/- 1.6 pg/mL (P less than 0.01), respectively] and controls [38.4 +/- 1.6 pg/mL (P less than 0.001) and 26.3 +/- 1.1 pg/mL (P less than 0.001), respectively]. The coexistence of high plasma ACTH and low CSF ACTH in Cushing's disease yielded a CSF/plasma ACTH ratio consistently less than that in depressed patients, with only 2 of 31 subjects comprising both groups showing values that overlapped. In contrast, 9 of the combined patients showed ACTH responses to ovine CRH that overlapped. These data suggest that differences in centrally directed CRH secretion may account for the differential presentation of the dysphoric syndromes seen in major depression and Cushing's disease. Hence, the classic form of major depression (melancholia), is often associated with evidence of pathological hyperarousal, such as intense anxiety, sleeplessness, and anorexia, while that of Cushing's disease is associated with evidence of pathological hyperarousal, including hyperphagia, fatigue, and inertia. Moreover, measurement of the CSF/plasma ACTH ratio may serve as a clinically useful adjunct to the ovine CRH stimulation test and other laboratory measures in determining the differential diagnosis between major depression and Cushing's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies suggest that an alteration of the neuroendocrine system may particularly occur in senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT). In the present study the reactivity of the hypophyseal-adrenocortical axis (HPA) in the elderly was assessed by hormonal stimulation of the hypophysis. Twelve young men (aged 21-24 yr), 15 mentally healthy elderly (aged 65-90 yr), and 12 patients with SDAT (aged 60-84 yr) received an iv bolus injection containing 50 micrograms CRH and 0.5 IU lysine vasopressin after a baseline period of 2 h. ACTH, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone secretion was monitored over a period of 2 h before and after the injection. The baseline ACTH concentrations were increased in both groups of elderly, the baseline cortisol levels were not different in either group. The peak ACTH and cortisol levels were significantly elevated in the mentally healthy elderly, whereas senile demented patients showed a rise comparable with that in the young subjects. Moreover, in the demented patients the post-stimulus decline in plasma ACTH levels seemed to be delayed. Dehydroepiandrosterone was significantly lowered in subjects of all ages. Our results demonstrate an enhanced reactivity of the HPA in mentally healthy elderly. This is possibly due to a diminished sensitivity of the feedback regulation to glucocorticoids. However, SDAT patients had, compared to healthy elderly subjects, an attenuated response to CRH/lysine vasopressin and a prolonged ACTH secretion, indicating alterations of the HPA in this disease.\r"

Both groups had comparable rates of glucose turnover and plasma levels of branched chain amino acids and FFA at baseline. The low as well as the high insulin dose stimulated peripheral glucose uptake much more effectively in prepubertal children (P less than 0.05). In contrast, suppression of hepatic glucose production (60% at low dose in both groups, pNS) and lowering of substrates in response to insulin was not affected by puberty at either dose. During the hyperglycemic clamp pubertal children showed enhanced insulin responses and in turn a sharper fall in amino acids (P less than 0.05 vs. prepubertals). Our data suggest that insulin resistance during puberty is restricted to peripheral glucose metabolism. Selective insulin resistance leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia may serve to amplify insulin's effect on amino acid metabolism, thereby facilitating protein anabolism during this period of rapid growth.\r"

  ".U": "91123318\r", 
  ".W": "It is generally believed that the cardioprotective benefit of long term treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen results in part from its capacity to increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) and lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations. The extent to which the various estrogens employed in replacement treatment affect the composition of lipoproteins, however, is not known. For this reason, we have examined the impact of one such preparation, the synthetic estrone estropipate (1.25 mg/day), on lipoprotein levels and composition in six postmenopausal women. After 6 months of treatment, whole plasma triglyceride (pretreatment, 135 +/- 63; posttreatment, 143 +/- 56 mg/dL), cholesterol (pretreatment, 232 +/- 14; posttreatment, 216 +/- 29 mg/dL), and HDL-C (pretreatment, 57.8 +/- 14.8; posttreatment, 55.6 +/- 13.2) were unchanged. However, plasma free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) fell (pretreatment, 73.4 +/- 6.2; posttreatment, 53.7 +/- 9.3 mg/dL; P less than 0.05) and lecithin (L) rose significantly (pretreatment, 2.12 +/- 0.29; posttreatment, 2.47 +/- 0.34 mumol/mL; P less than 0.01). The consequence of these changes was a significant decline in the plasma FC/L ratio (pretreatment, 0.91 +/- 0.17; posttreatment, 0.68 +/- 0.12; P less than 0.01) to levels observed in healthy menstruating women. The calculated lipoprotein particle size was unchanged in very low density lipoproteins and increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in LDL after estropipate therapy. Since qualitatively altered lipoproteins enriched in FC and an increased FC/L ratio in plasma are both associated with increased coronary risk, the improvement noted in these parameters after estropipate therapy indicates that its use may be beneficial despite the lack of change in whole plasma lipids.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the pulsatile nature of PRL release in the physiologically hyperprolactinemic postpartum period, we sampled blood at 10-min intervals for 24 h in each of 6 healthy lactating women at both 3 weeks and 3 months postpartum. The subsequent immunoactive PRL time series were subjected to episodic peak detection (Cluster analysis) and multiple parameter deconvolution analysis. The 24-h mean serum PRL concentrations were significantly higher at 3 weeks than at 3 months postpartum; viz. 113 +/- 12 vs. 66 +/- 15 micrograms/L (P = 0.003). Assessment of episodic PRL pulsatility revealed significantly higher maximal PRL peak heights (296 +/- 63 vs. 141 +/- 44 micrograms/L), fractional peak heights (863 +/- 150 vs. 374 +/- 58%), incremental peak amplitudes (250 +/- 60 vs. 96 +/- 3 micrograms/L), and peak areas (13 +/- 3 vs. 4 +/- 1 mg/L.min) in the earlier postpartum period. In contrast, PRL peak frequencies and interpulse intervals were not different in the early and late postpartum sessions. Deconvolution analysis revealed that the mean mass of PRL secretory bursts was significantly greater at 3 weeks (182 +/- 4.1 micrograms/L) than 3 months (15 +/- 1.6 micrograms/L). There were no changes in the calculated half-life of endogenous PRL viz. 29 +/- 2.5 min (3 weeks) vs. 26 +/- 3.0 min (3 months). We conclude that physiological postpartum hyperprolactinemia is achieved by selectively altering the endogenous secretory rate in each PRL release episode, with no change in the number of bursts of PRL discharged or the PRL half-life.\r"

GH stimulation tests in the children who were receiving LHRHa treatment were performed after 2 days of ethinyl estradiol administration. Thirty-one of 81 children (38%) who underwent GH stimulation tests had subnormal responses (less than or equal to 7 micrograms/L) to all tests administered (at least 2 stimuli), including 22 of 67 (33%) who had precocious puberty that was idiopathic or associated with hypothalamic hamartoma. Eleven of 32 children (34%) who underwent measurement of the mean nighttime spontaneous GH level had levels below the normal range for prepubertal children (less than 1.2 microgram/L). Despite the high incidence of subnormal GH levels, there appeared to be no relationship between the GH levels of these children and their growth characteristics. The height, growth velocity, bone maturation rate, predicted height, and insulin-like growth factor-I levels were not different between the children with low GH levels and the children with normal GH levels. Conversely, the GH levels were not different between the children with subnormal growth rates and the children with normal growth rates. Thus, variation in the growth rates of these LHRHa-treated children with central precocious puberty could not be explained by variation in the stimulated or spontaneous secretion of GH. In attempting to understand the high incidence of low GH levels in children with precocious puberty, we examined the relationship between GH level and body mass index (BMI). Both the stimulated (r = -0.33; P less than 0.002) and the spontaneous (r = -0.61; P less than 0.0002) GH levels were inversely related to BMI. Moreover, the children with precocious puberty as a group had significantly elevated BMI [1.2 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) SD units] compared to normal children of the same age (P less than 0.0001). Thus, increased body mass may explain the high incidence of subnormal GH levels in these patients, and normative GH levels adjusted for body mass are needed before it can be concluded that the apparently subnormal GH levels in LHRHa-treated children with precocious puberty are in fact low.\r"

Palmitate flux at the chosen euglucagonemic hormone infusion rates was similar to baseline values (1.73 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.75 +/- 0.23 and 1.35 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.16 mumol/kg.min, respectively, in IDDM and nondiabetic subjects). No significant changes in palmitate flux occurred in response to glucagon withdrawal or mild (nondiabetic volunteers) or high physiological (IDDM volunteers) hyperglucagonemia.

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids play an important role in the therapy of arthritic diseases. We sought, firstly, to identify, characterize and localize glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in normal human chondrocytes and, secondly, to determine whether glucocorticoid suppression of human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rhIL-1 beta)-stimulated metalloproteases (MPs) synthesis by chondrocytes requires GR occupancy. Radioligand binding studies with cultured chondrocytes revealed the presence of high affinity-low capacity [3H]dexamethasone (DEX) binding sites with the following kinetic parameters: Kd = 12.5 +/- 1.4 nmol/L, Nmax = 57,560 +/- 3,960 sites per cell. Competition studies indicated that the DEX binding site was glucocorticoid specific and the competitive hierarchy established was: DEX greater than RU-26988 greater than RU-486 greater than cortisol greater than progesterone much greater than testosterone greater than estradiol-17 beta. Immunocytochemical studies using a specific anti-human GR antiserum identified immunoreactive material primarily in the cytoplasm with cells cultured in the absence of glucocorticoids. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-Western immunoblotting analysis of chondrocyte cytosol detected the presence of a macromolecular species comigrating with a standard protein possessing a molecular weight of 94 kilodalton. rhIL-1 beta provoked the synthesis and secretion of the MPs stromelysin and collagenase from human chondrocytes in a saturable, coordinate, and dose-dependent fashion. DEX and cortisol inhibited the cytokine-stimulated MP synthesis in similar dose-dependent fashions: DEX, IC50 for stromelysin and collagenase suppression was 1.12 X 10(-8) mol/L and 1.26 X 10(-9) mol/L, respectively and the IC50 for cortisol was 6.3 X 10(-7) mol/L and 4.9 X 10(-8) mol/L, respectively. rhIL-1 beta failed to stimulate metalloprotease synthesis and release from chondrocytes pretreated with 10 nmol/L DEX, even after 20 days of incubation. The antiglucocorticoid, RU-486 completely reversed the DEX induced suppression of MP synthesis at 10(-7) mol/L. RU-486 alone had no effect on MP synthesis. We believe there is a biochemical rationale for the therapeutic efficacy of glucocorticoid administration in the management of arthritic diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and cytokines such as IL-1 are likely to be involved in the increase in MP synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "There is doubt about concentrations of circulating calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the value of plasma CGRP measurements in the detection and follow-up of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Thus, we developed an immunochemiluminometric sandwich assay for CGRP using antibodies purified from a polyclonal antiserum against human CGRP. The assay was sensitive (limit of detection, 0.4 pmol/L; multiply by 3.7892 to derive nanograms per L) and highly specific [no cross-reaction with human calcitonin (CT)]. Normal plasma CGRP values ranged from less than 0.4 to 4.5 pmol/L (median, 0.8; n = 31), with 61% having detectable levels. Values in samples from patients with MTC were elevated: unoperated patients (n = 10), 4.7-137 pmol/L (median, 7.1); and operated patients with gross persistent or recurrent tumor (n = 14), 4.7-171 pmol/L (median, 23.2). In contrast, CGRP values were normal in 78% of nine postoperative patients with elevated CT, but no detectable tumor (range, less than 0.4 to 6.3 pmol/L; median, 1.6). CGRP levels increased after pentagastrin injection in MTC patients, but less than did CT values. Cultured MTC cells in vitro secreted large amounts of CGRP, and rat nerve root ganglia, human osteoblasts, and microvessel endothelial cells secreted lesser amounts. We conclude that CGRP circulates in normal plasma, but at very low levels. Plasma CGRP concentrations are frequently high in patients with MTC, but primarily in those with gross tumor or metastases. Plasma CT assay is the preferable test for MTC, but CGRP assay deserves prospective study for a possible role in predicting gross metastasis.\r"

Subjects were tested before treatment and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 cyclic sequential hormone regimens for 1 yr. Groups A and C received 0.625 or 1.25 mg conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), respectively, for days 1-25 and 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate from days 15-25. Groups B and D were given 0.625 or 1.25 mg CEE, respectively, from days 1-25 and placebo from days 15-25. The higher dose of CEE induced supraphysiological levels of plasma estrone. Plasma testosterone levels were lower in group A when blood was sampled during days 18-20 at a time when they were ingesting both 0.625 mg CEE and 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (P less than 0.05), although these decreases were perhaps too trivial to have affected sexual behavior as was hypothesized. Women in group A also had more negative moods and more psychological symptomatology during treatment compared to those in group D who were receiving 1.25 mg CEE and placebo (P less than 0.01). Regardless of group, sexual desire and arousal were higher during the first 2 weeks of the treatment cycle than during week 4 when no hormones were being ingested (P less than 0.05). These findings demonstrate that the effects of progestin on the central nervous system are reflected by an increase in psychological, exclusive of sexual, symptomatology and are attenuated by a higher estrogen/progestin dose ratio.\r"

Total serum calcium and serum beta-endorphin revealed significant changes after all four administrations (P less than 0.05). After the two highest intranasal and the im doses cAMP increased 10% and 35%, respectively (P less than 0.05). All administrations except the 50 IU intranasal dose produced significant increases in plasma sCT (P less than 0.05). The areas under the concentration-time curves, calculated for the period with the maximal changes (i.e. 120-240 min), illustrated a significant dose-related response in total serum calcium, beta-endorphin, and sCT (P less than 0.01-0.001). cAMP showed a dose-related tendency, the response to the im injection being significantly higher than that to the two lowest doses of intranasal sCT (P less than 0.05). We conclude that the doses administered produce a dose-related biological response and bioavailability. In women with normal and high bone turnover, sCT 100 IU intranasally seems as optimal as 50 IU im. The response to sCT should, furthermore, be assessed on bioactivity rather than on bioavailability.\r"

Nine of the 11 had PTH concentrations within the normal range. Of these 9, 6 were found to have abnormal parathyroid function when challenged with an iv calcium infusion. The other 2 patients demonstrated significantly elevated basal PTH concentrations and elevated ionized calcium despite normal total serum calcium and albumin concentrations. In both, the PTH response to infused calcium was markedly abnormal, confirming hyperparathyroidism. The estimated renal threshold phosphate concentration was low in 4 of 9 patients with normal basal PTH concentrations and in both with elevated basal PTH. Bone mineral density, measured at the radius by single photon absorptiometry and at the spine by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, was normal in 8 of the 9 transplant recipients who had normal basal PTH concentrations.\r"

The relationship between osteoclast precursors and monocyte lineage is far from clear. We recently showed that human cord monocytes in culture, by contrast to adult monocytes, develop some features of osteoclast precursors. We therefore assessed the presence of CT receptors on monocytes. We could not demonstrate any CT receptors on adult monocytes. By contrast, we observed in cultured cord monocytes increased cAMP production in presence of CT. This cAMP response was observed after a 2-week culture and only in the presence of 10(-9) M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. After a 3-week culture, CT 10(-9) to 10(-6) M increased cAMP production dose dependently from 10(-9) M; however the curve was shallower than the one observed in a control CT receptor positive tumoral cell line, MCF7. 125I sCT bound specifically to cord monocytes cultured during 3 weeks; apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was 3.3 +/- 2.2 10(-10) M and average receptor number was 5.1 +/- 0.4 10(4)/cell. On autoradiography all the cells, whether mono or multinucleated, were labeled with 125sCT. One or 2-h exposure to salmon CT did not induce cell contraction. In conclusion, CT receptors can be induced on newborn cord monocytes in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This observation shows that osteoclasts and fetal monocytes share a common membrane determinant.\r"

Steady state levels of 3 beta HSD mRNA were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) from corpora lutea removed during the midluteal phase (days 7-8 of the luteal phase) than those in newly formed corpora lutea and declined to 10% of early luteal phase values by days 13-15 of the luteal phase. 3 beta HSD mRNA levels fell to nondetectable values upon luteal regression. These results reveal a paradoxical relationship between the steroidogenic activity of the primate corpus luteum in vivo and the steady state levels of the mRNAs that encode for the major enzymes involved in progesterone biosynthesis. Unlike serum progesterone concentrations, which are very low immediately after ovulation and then rise during the midluteal phase, the steady stale levels of P450SCC mRNA and 3 beta HSD appeared to be maximal or near maximal shortly after ovulation and declined throughout the remainder of the luteal phase. These findings are consistent with the notion that luteal lifespan is set at the time of ovulation and luteinization, and the decline in luteal function may be due in part to decay of specialized luteal cell mRNAs with finite half-lives.\r"

  ".W": "Pyridinoline (Pyr) and deoxypyridinoline (D-Pyr) are two cross-links of collagen molecules that are present in the extracellular matrix and released during its degradation. In contrast to the wide distribution of collagen, Pyr is present in bone and cartilage, but not in significant amounts in other connective tissues, and D-Pyr appears to be specific for bone tissue. Therefore, the urinary excretion of Pyr and D-Pyr might be a sensitive marker of bone matrix degradation. Using a specific high pressure liquid chromatography assay we have measured Pyr and D-Pyr cross-links in a 24-h and a fasting urine sample in 60 early postmenopausal women and 19 premenopausal women matched for age. Menopause induced a 62% increase in Fu Pyr (49.8 +/- 18.7 vs. 30.8 +/- 8.0 pmol/mumol creatinine; P less than 0.001) and an 82% increase in Fu D-Pyr (8.2 +/- 3.4 vs. 4.5 +/- 1.4 pmol/mumol creatinine; P less than 0.001). In 20 postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy, urinary Pyr and D-Pyr returned to premenopausal levels within 6 months, contrasting with unchanged levels during placebo treatment. The 24-h excretion of Pyr and D-Pyr was significantly lower than the fasting excretion, but was similarly decreased after hormone replacement therapy. Pyr and D-Pyr excretion measured in the same urinary sample were highly correlated (r = 0.85 for fasting and 0.83 for 24-h sampling), but correlations between fasting and 24-h values were weak (D-Pyr, r = 0.30; Pyr, r = 0.29; P less than 0.05 for both). Correlations between urinary cross-links and other markers of bone turnover (Fu hydroxyproline/creatinine and plasma osteocalcin) were significant but low (Pyr vs. osteocalcin, r = 0.29, P less than 0.05; Pyr vs. hydroxyproline, r = 0/.34; P less than 0.01; D-Pyr vs. osteocalcin, r = 0.39; P less than 0.01), except for D-Pyr vs. hydroxyproline (r = 0.24; P = 0.07), suggesting that these markers reflect different events of bone metabolism. Finally, a single measurement of the fasting excretion, but not of the 24-h excretion, of cross-links was significantly correlated (Pyr, r = 0.34; P less than 0.05; D-Pyr, r = -0.46; P less than 0.01), with the subsequent spontaneous rate of bone loss assessed by repeated measurements of the radial bone mineral content in 37 postmenopausal women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen deficiency may account for lower circulating GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations in the menopause. Since the liver is the major source of circulating IGF-I and oral estrogens have nonphysiological effects on hepatic function, we have compared GH secretion over 24 h from 20 min sampling and serum IGF-I levels in premenopausal women (n = 7, follicular phase) and postmenopausal women before and after 2 months of cyclical replacement therapy with either oral ethinyl estradiol (EE, 20 micrograms daily; n = 7) or transdermal 17 beta-estradiol (E2, 100 micrograms patches applied twice weekly; n = 7). The extent of GH binding to its serum binding protein was also examined by measuring the percent specific binding of [125I] GH in serum. Mean 24-h serum GH and serum IGF-I were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women. Oral and transdermal estrogen therapy resulted in a comparable degree of gonadotropin suppression. Oral EE treatment increased mean 24-h serum GH (2.0 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.6 mIU/L, P less than 0.0005) and mean pulse amplitude (5.3 +/- 1.2 to 11.2 +/- 2.5 mIU/L, P less than 0.01) but significantly reduced circulating IGF-I (0.70 +/- 0.09 to 0.47 +/- 0.04 U/mL, P less than 0.02) levels. Oral EE increased the percent specific binding of [125I]GH (22.0 +/- 1.6 to 32.0 +/- 1.9%, P less than 0.0005), however the derived mean 24-h free serum GH concentrations were significantly higher (P less than 0.0005) after treatment. By contrast, transdermal E2 administration, which restored circulating E2 concentrations to the midfollicular range, increased circulating IGF-I (0.86 +/- 0.15 to 1.10 +/- 0.14 U/mL, P less than 0.005) to levels that were not significantly different from those of premenopausal women (1.41 +/- 0.21 U/mL). This was not accompanied by changes in 24-h GH secretion or the percent specific binding of [125I]GH in serum. The route of administration is a major determinant of the effects of exogenous estrogens on the GH/IGF-I axis. Oral estrogen administration inhibits hepatic IGF-I synthesis and increases GH secretion through reduced feedback inhibition. Reduced GH secretion in the menopause is not explained by estrogen deficiency since GH secretion is not restored by the attainment of physiological E2 concentrations using the transdermal route. The contrasting route dependent IGF-I responses have important implications for the long-term benefit of hormone replacement therapy in the menopause.\r"

It is generally accepted that bone formation is depressed during corticosteroid treatment, but the cause of the ongoing bone resorption is less clear. Secondary hyperparathyroidism and changes in vitamin D metabolism are thought to play a role. This is based mostly on data from cross-sectional studies in heterogeneous patient groups. We, therefore, studied longitudinally the course of biochemical parameters and the hormones influencing bone turnover in a homogeneous group of 10 euthyroid patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, all euthyroid for at least 1 yr before, during, and after a 12-week course of prednisone. Bone formation was depressed as reflected by a fall in serum osteocalcin (3.0 +/- 2.1, 1.7 +/- 1.1, and 2.4 +/- 1.9 micrograms/L at weeks 0, 4, and 12, respectively; P = 0.02) and in total alkaline phosphatase (1.15 +/- 0.33, 0.83 +/- 0.22, and 0.88 +/- 0.40 mukat/L; P = 0.001). Parameters of bone resorption (urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio, serum acid phosphatase) and the levels of vitamin D metabolites remained unchanged. Serum intact PTH seemed to decrease slightly. Our findings suggest that glucocorticoid induced osteopenia is caused by a depressed bone formation in the presence of an unaltered but ongoing bone resorption. Secondary hyperparathyroidism and changes in vitamin D metabolism are apparently not involved.\r"

  ".W": "GH-binding proteins (GH-BPs) in human blood theoretically may interfere with measurements of immunoreactive GH by forming complexes with GH and competing with antibody reagents for ligand. Indeed, results of serum GH obtained by immunoassays are known to differ markedly depending on the assay employed. To assess the potential role of circulating GH-BPs in this phenomenon, we systematically examined their effect on GH measurement in four RIAs and two immunoradiometric assays. In all except one RIA, the effect of the BPs on tracer binding to antibody was mildly inhibitory. In both immunoradiometric assays, BPs increased the nonspecific association of the tracer with the solid phase reagent. However, these effects were minor at the BP concentrations realistically encountered in practice. Furthermore, the impact of BPs on GH standard curves and final results was negligible because BP effects fall into the category of nonspecific or zero dose counts, which are subtracted during data reduction. We conclude that GH-BPs are only a minor disturbance in GH immunoassays, which is completely compensated for by conventional assay design. Disparities among results yielded by different assays are probably not due to BP interference.\r"

The total ultrafiltrable calcium was significantly higher in the postmenopausal group, mainly due to their higher complexed calcium fraction, due in turn to their higher bicarbonate and anion gap concentrations. Urinary calcium was also significantly higher in the postmenopausal group even after correcting for sodium. After matching for total calcium and each of the calcium fractions in turn, the urinary calcium remained significantly higher in the post- than in the premenopausal sets even after correction for sodium. The implication is that the rise in urinary calcium at the menopause is due to reduced tubular reabsorption of calcium rather than to an increase in filtered load. We suggest that estrogens promote tubular reabsorption of calcium and that the rise in bone resorption at the menopause could be accounted for, at least in part, by the effect of estrogen deficiency on the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "To gain insight into early reproductive processes we have prospectively designed ovum donation protocols to elucidate several phenomena relating to embryo implantation and pregnancy sustenance. Artificial endometrial cycles with variable follicular phases were induced in 60 recipients by sequential estrogen and progesterone. A total of 964 oocytes were retrieved throughout 43 ovum donation attempts, for an average of 22.4 (range, 16-41) eggs/retrieval. The overall delivery rate per egg retrieval (donors and recipients combined) was 72.1% (31 of 43). The shortest estrogen stimulation (short follicular phase) resulting in ongoing pregnancies was 5 days in duration, while the longest (long follicular phase) was 35 days in duration before progesterone initiation. Utilization of variable length follicular phases, artificially extended the stage of endometrial receptivity to over 4 weeks. To assess the window of implantation, same age embryos were transferred onto endometrium of different maturational stages. Pregnancies were documented with embryo transfers between luteal day 1 (day 15) to luteal day 6 (day 20), extending the window of implantation in the human to at least 6 consecutive days. To evaluate the relative contribution of oocyte quality and endometrial receptivity to pregnancy outcome, common source ova were transferred onto endometrium with variable hormonal exposure. Despite the drastically different follicular phase estradiol levels and periods of exposure, similar delivery rates were attained in donor cycles (29.4%) and recipient cycles during short follicular phases (29.6%). Slightly higher delivery rates (39.4%) were observed with long follicular phases. The comparable pregnancy rates in donors and recipients are attributed to the common source oocytes regardless of endometrial stimulation.\r"

The high carbohydrate diet was more than 50% (of energy intake) carbohydrate and less than 30% fat; the high fat diet was more than 45% fat (predominantly saturated) and less than 40% carbohydrate. The diets were consumed over consecutive 3-week periods in random sequence. The mean whole body glucose uptake during the glucose clamps was similar after the high carbohydrate (48.3 mumol/kg.min) and high fat diets (47.0 mumol/kg.min; P = 0.5; 95% confidence interval for the difference, -3.4 to 5.9 mumol/kg.min). Fasting blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations were also unchanged. In contrast, there were substantial effects on lipoprotein metabolism. During the high carbohydrate diet, fasting serum cholesterol decreased by 17% (P = 0.06), low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 20% (P = 0.05), high density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 24% (P less than 0.005), and triglyceride increased by 33% (P = 0.06) compared with levels during the high fat diet. These results suggest that practically achievable high carbohydrate diets do not enhance insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic subjects and have net effects on lipoprotein metabolism that may be unfavorable.\r"

  ".W": "Although levels of serum osteocalcin are thought to be an indicator of osteoblastic activity and bone formation, there is little information regarding the acute effects of changes in calcium or PTH levels on circulating osteocalcin concentrations. To study the effect of stepwise decreases in ionized calcium (CaI) on osteocalcin levels, we infused six normal subjects with citrate for four 30-min intervals using two different protocols. One protocol (pulse infusion) used alternating rates of infusion and resulted in rapid stepwise decrements in serum CaI. The second protocol (continuous infusion) used constant intermediate rates of citrate infusion and produced slower decrements in CaI, but with similar changes in magnitude. We monitored serum CaI, intact PTH, and osteocalcin concentrations during the course of these infusions. During each step of the pulse infusion the osteocalcin responses to changes in CaI in general were parallel to the changes in PTH (r = 0.462; P = 0.02) and were inversely correlated to CaI (r = -0.562; P = 0.003). The osteocalcin concentrations at the end of each 30-min period were higher than at the beginning of that period; over the total 120 min, osteocalcin levels rose from 3.46 +/- 0.63 to 6.88 +/- 1.08 micrograms/L (P less than 0.05). In contrast, during the first two periods of the continuous infusion, osteocalcin concentrations changed slightly. Only during the last two periods of the continuous infusion did osteocalcin respond in a manner characteristic of that observed with the pulse infusion. These data indicate that osteocalcin concentrations in the circulation may be acutely regulated by calcium and/or PTH.\r"

  ".U": "91123343\r", 
  ".W": "To define the spontaneous diurnal variations in glucose regulation during fasting in noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), we measured circulating levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GH, cortisol, and glucagon at 15-min intervals in 11 patients with untreated diabetes and 7 matched control subjects studied during a 24-h period. The rates of insulin secretion were derived from the concentrations of C-peptide by deconvolution using a two-compartment mathematical model for C-peptide distribution and metabolism. In both groups of subjects, despite continued fasting, glucose levels stopped declining in the evening and subsequently rose throughout the night to reach a morning maximum. Elevated levels persisted until noon. The morning glucose maximum corresponded to a relative increase of 23.8 +/- 5.5% above the evening nadir in NIDDM patients and 13.2 +/- 4.6% in nondiabetic subjects (P less than 0.05). In NIDDM patients, insulin levels and insulin secretion rates did not parallel the nocturnal glucose changes. In contrast, in control subjects, this nocturnal glucose rise coincided with a similar increase in insulin secretion rates. Cortisol concentrations in patients with NIDDM were higher than those in control subjects throughout the study period (P less than 0.001) and rose earlier in the evening than in control subjects, thus failing to demonstrate the normal nocturnal suppression. In both groups of subjects, the nighttime glucose elevation was temporally and quantitatively correlated with the circadian cortisol rise. GH secretion was increased in the evening and nighttime periods compared to the daytime values, and in NIDDM patients, but not in control subjects, the size of the morning glucose elevation was directly related to the magnitude of this increase in GH secretion (r = 0.88; P less than 0.01). Glucagon concentrations were similar in both groups of subjects and remained essentially constant throughout the study period. We hypothesize that the nocturnal glucose rise that occurs during fasting represents a normal diurnal variation in the set-point of glucose regulation amplified by counterregulatory mechanisms activated by the fasting condition.\r"

Seven of these patients had bone and soft tissue metastases, 4 had only soft metastases, and 4 had only bone metastases. The follow-up period ranged from 6-54 months; the number of doses ranged from 2-11, with 2.9 (78.4 mCi) to 9.25 gigabequerel (GBq) (250 mCi)/administration and a cumulative activity from 11.1-85.90 GBq (300-2322 mCi). The absorbed cumulative dose in tumors ranged from 12-155 Gy. A beneficial effect of the treatment was observed in 9 patients (60%). No complete remission of the disease was observed. Seven patients died during the study, among whom 4 never responded to the treatment. Seven had hormonal responses (4 complete and 3 partial), with a duration ranging from 5-48 months. Among these patients, 4 relapsed, and 3 died within 3 months. Five patients had partial tumoral responses mainly located in soft tissues and for a duration ranging from 29-54 months. All patients with a hormonal response had objective improvement in clinical status and blood pressure. There was no clear-cut relationship between the cumulative dose and the responses. The main side-effect observed in 1 patient with widespread bone metastases after three doses (12.9 GBq) was a pancytopenia, which resolved after treatment was discontinued. This study suggests that repeated [131I]MIBG treatment could be effective in patients with advanced malignant pheochromocytoma.\r"

We measured serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-(OH)2D, 24,25-(OH)2D, alkaline phosphatase (sAP), and the urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio (UOH prol/creat) in 19 patients with Paget's disease of bone and 16 age- and sex-matched controls. As expected, sAP, UOH prol/creat, and sBGP levels were significantly elevated, and there was a tendency to a decrease in serum levels of 24,25-(OH)2D in Pagetic patients with respect to the control group. There was no significant difference between patients and controls in serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-(OH)2D. The Pagetic patients were subdivided into two subgroups; subgroup A had normal sBGP levels (less than 5 ng/mL), and subgroup B had increased sBGP levels (greater than 5 ng/mL). Serum 24,25-(OH)2D levels in subgroup B were significantly lower than those in controls, while subgroup A showed levels similar to those in the control group. We also found a positive linear correlation between sAP and sBGP and between sAP and UOH prol/creat as well as a negative linear correlation between sBGP and 24,25-(OH)2D and between 24,25-(OH)2D and UOH prol/creat in Pagetic patients. These results point to a possible role of 24,25-(OH)2D in disease activity.\r"

The aim of our study was to verify in two groups of children with idiopathic short stature the effect of intranasal administration of neostigmine (inNS; 3 mg), a cholinesterase inhibitor, on basal GH levels as well as on the somatotroph response to GHRH when the peptide was administered either iv (ivGHRH; 1 microgram/kg) or intranasally (inGHRH; 10 micrograms/kg). In group A (n = 6; age, 10.6-16.0 yr) inNS induced a significant GH increase [inNS vs. saline, area under the curve (AUC; mean +/- SEM), 263.7 +/- 60.2 vs. 73.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/L.h; P less than 0.03] and potentiated the somatotroph response to ivGHRH (inNS with ivGHRH vs. ivGHRH, 1316 +/- 183.0 vs. 644.9 +/- 154.5 micrograms/L.h; P less than 0.03). In group B (n = 6; age, 11.5-15.9 yr) ivGHRH induced a GH rise clearly higher than that induced by inGHRH (604.2 +/- 154.3 vs. 137.1 +/- 28.2 micrograms/L.h; P less than 0.03). Administration of inNS induced a GH rise similar to that occurring after inGHRH (AUC, 239.2 +/- 69.5 micrograms/L.h) and markedly increased the inGHRH-induced GH response (482.4 +/- 103.6 micrograms/L.h; P less than 0.05 and 0.03 vs. inNS and inGHRH, respectively), so that it overlapped with that induced by ivGHRH alone. In conclusion, cholinergic agonists such as neostigmine are able to increase both basal and GHRH-induced GH secretion in short children even when given intranasally. Combined intranasal administration of neostigmine and GHRH (10 micrograms/kg) is able to induce a GH rise similar to that induced by ivGHRH alone (1 microgram/kg), suggesting the potential usefulness of this combination cocktail and route of administration for the treatment of short stature.\r"

Met-GH infusions induce lipolysis with a rise of plasma FFA that are known to suppress GH release, but the met-GH inhibition of the GH response to GHRH occurs also when lipolysis is pharmacologically blocked by acipimox. In addition, the inhibition of GH release might be due to an enhanced release of hypothalamic somatostatin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a met-GH infusion on the GH response to GHRH when lipolysis and hypothalamic somatostatin release are pharmacologically blocked. Twelve normal subjects, randomly allocated to two groups (A and B), received GHRH (50 micrograms, iv) at 1300 h after a 4-h saline infusion or met-GH infusion (80 ng/kg.min). To block lipolysis and hypothalamic somatostatin release, subjects in group B received acipimox, an antilipolytic agent (500 mg), and pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (60 mg), during the 6 h before iv GHRH. GHRH induced a clear GH release during saline infusion in both groups, significantly higher in group B (43.6 +/- 4.8 micrograms/L) than in group A (20.1 +/- 6.1 micrograms/L; P less than 0.02 vs. A), and only a slight increase during met-GH infusions (10.4 +/- 4.1 micrograms/L in group A; 16.7 +/- 4.2 micrograms/L in group B; P = NS). These data indicate that the GH response to GHRH is inhibited by met-GH infusions when peripheral lipolysis and hypothalamic somatostatin release are pharmacologically blocked, suggesting the possibility of autoinhibition of GH at the pituitary level.\r"

An acute iv GHRH test (2 micrograms/kg BW) was performed before and after 2 and 6 months of treatment.

The mean growth velocity (GV) during treatment was only 2.99 +/- 1.67 cm/yr and only two patients increased their GV by more than 2 cm/yr. A correlation was found between GV during treatment and the peak serum GH response to GHRH acute test before treatment (r = 0.68, P less than 0.005) as well as between GH response to the acute test and patient's bone age (r = -0.46, P less than 0.05). The results indicate that in some severely GHD patients with no response to GHRH even after a 2-month priming period, 6 months of treatment with GHRH can evoke pituitary responsiveness. We speculate that the duration of the GHRH deficiency and its severity plays a role in the ability of somatotrophs to respond to this stimulus.\r"

Serum osteocalcin levels are negatively correlated with bone density in patients with overt hyperthyroidism. Osteocalcin levels are also elevated in patients with multinodular goiter and subclinical hyperthyroidism. We therefore measured serum osteocalcin levels in patients taking T4 to determine if they correlated with the degree of TSH suppression. Despite an upward trend in serum osteocalcin measurements with decreasing TSH concentrations, there was no significant difference in serum osteocalcin among groups of patients with normal (0.5-5.0 mu/L), mildly reduced (0.1-0.5 mU/L), or undetectable serum TSH (less than 0.01 mU/L). However, a weak negative correlation was seen between serum TSH and osteocalcin concentrations (r = 0.29, slope = -0.28, P less than 0.05). Osteocalcin did not correlate with either serum free T4 or free T3 concentrations. Serum PTH concentrations were not different among the three patient groups. Our data suggest that osteocalcin is not a useful clinical marker for increased bone turnover in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism due to T4 therapy. However, the trend towards higher osteocalcin levels in patients with suppressed serum TSH values, and the weak negative correlation between serum TSH and osteocalcin are consistent with findings of reduced bone density in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) between women with endometriosis and age-similar controls. Eighty-five women from nine North American centers (mean age, 30.7 yr) with laparoscopically proven endometriosis (study patients) were enrolled in a study of the efficacy of nafarelin, a GnRH agonist. Fifty-two women (mean age, 32 yr) from the Palo Alto area, with regular menstrual cycles and no major medical problems, served as age-similar controls. Both groups were predominantly (greater than 92%) white. The mean BMD of the lumbar spine was 1.1 g/cm2 in both the study subjects and the controls. Study patients were 104.8% and controls were 104.8% of normal values for age. BMD was not significantly different in the two groups. BMD was not correlated with severity or time from diagnosis of endometriosis. BMD was positively correlated with weight (r = 0.28; P less than 0.05) in both groups, with height (r = 0.30; P less than 0.01) in study patients, and marginally with height (r = 0.26; P less than 0.07) in controls. This study showed no difference in BMD between endometriosis patients and age-similar controls; both groups had normal BMD.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the temporal relationship between changes in contractile performance and flux through the citric acid cycle in hearts oxidizing acetoacetate, we perfused isolated working rat hearts with either glucose or acetoacetate (both 5 mM) and freeze-clamped the tissue at defined times. After 60 min of perfusion, hearts utilizing acetoacetate exhibited lower systolic and diastolic pressures and lower cardiac outputs. The oxidation of acetoacetate increased the tissue content of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate and decreased the content of succinyl-CoA suggesting inhibition of citric acid cycle flux through 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. Whereas hearts perfused with either acetoacetate or glucose were similar with respect to their function for the first 20 min, changes in tissue metabolites were already observed within 5 min of perfusion at near-physiological workloads. The addition of lactate or propionate, but not acetate, to hearts oxidizing acetoacetate improved contractile performance, although inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was probably not diminished. If lactate or propionate were added, malate and citrate accumulated indicating utilization of anaplerotic pathways for the citric acid cycle. We conclude that a decreased rate of flux through 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase in hearts oxidizing acetoacetate precedes, and may be responsible for, contractile failure and is not the result of decreased cardiac work. Further, anaplerosis play an important role in the maintenance of contractile function in hearts utilizing acetoacetate.\r"

Whereas the growth of normal blood BFU-E in vitro rapidly declined by 40 and 60% after 24 and 48 h of incubation without 50 U/ml of rIL-3, the growth of PV BFU-E declined by only 10 and 30% under the same conditions, demonstrating a reduced dependence on rIL-3. A reduced dependence of PV BFU-E on recombinant human erythropoietin (rEP) was also present. Dose-response experiments showed a 117-fold increase in PV BFU-E sensitivity to rIL-3, and a 6.5-fold increase in sensitivity to rEP, compared to normal BFU-E, whereas blood BFU-E from patients with secondary polycythemia responded like normal BFU-E. Endogenous erythroid colony (EEC) formation, which is independent of the addition of rEP, was reduced by 50% after erythroid colony-forming cells were generated from PV BFU-E in vitro without rIL-3 for 3 d, whereas rEP-stimulated erythroid colonies were unaffected. These studies demonstrate a striking hypersensitivity of PV blood BFU-E to rIL-3, which may be the major factor in the pathogenesis of increased erythropoiesis without increased EP concentrations.\r"

In GSH-depleted and -repleted hepatocytes, the increase of specific activity of mitochondrial GSH lagged behind cytosol, reaching nearly the same specific activity by 1-2 h. However, in hepatocytes from ethanol-fed rats, the rate of increase of total GSH specific radioactivity in mitochondria was markedly suppressed. In in vivo steady-state experiments, the mass transport of GSH from cytosol to mitochondria and vice versa was 18 nmol/min per g liver, indicating that the half-life of mitochondrial GSH was approximately 18 min in controls. The fractional transport rate of GSH from cytosol to mitochondria, but not mitochondria to cytosol, was significantly reduced in the livers of ethanol-fed rats. Thus, ethanol-fed rats exhibit a decreased mitochondrial GSH pool size due to an impaired entry of cytosol GSH into mitochondria. Hepatocytes from ethanol-fed rats exhibited a greater susceptibility to the oxidant stress-induced cell death from tert-butylhydroperoxide. Incubation with glutathione monoethyl ester normalized the mitochondrial GSH and protected against the increased susceptibility to t-butylhydroperoxide, which was directly related to the lowered mitochondrial GSH pool size in ethanol-fed cells.\r"

  ".U": "91123433\r", 
  ".W": "In a baboon graft model of arterial intimal thickening, smooth muscle cells (SMC) have been observed to proliferate underneath an intact monolayer of endothelium and in the absence of platelet adherence. Because platelets are not present and therefore cannot be a major source of growth stimulus, we have proposed that the vascular wall cells in the graft intima express mitogens and regulate SMC proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the grafts for mitogenic activity and expression of growth factor genes. Segments of healing graft and of normal artery, when perfused ex vivo, released mitogenic activity into the perfusate. The graft released more mitogen than the normal arterial segment, and some of the activity was inhibitable with an antibody to human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In addition, Northern analysis of total RNA demonstrated higher expression of PDGF-A chain mRNA in the graft intima compared to normal artery. PDGF-B chain mRNA was barely detectable in both tissues. PDGF mRNA levels within the graft interstices were not measured. In situ hybridization of 7.5- or 12-wk grafts indicated that some luminal endothelial cells and adjacent intimal SMC contained PDGF-A chain mRNA. By thymidine autoradiography, intimal SMC were observed to be proliferating in the inner third of the intima. These data demonstrate a difference in the pattern of PDGF transcript expression and luminal perfusate activity in graft as compared with control arteries. The association of intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation with intimal PDGF mRNA expression and release of PDGF-like protein supports the hypothesis that factors from cells that have grown into the graft or populated its surface rather than platelets may regulate intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation in this model.\r"

In the fasting state the glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) immunoreactivity was significantly elevated in the NIDDM group compared with the control group. Both after intravenous arginine and after an oral glucose load a rise in the plasma concentrations of all immunoreactive moieties measured was seen. All integrated incremental responses after intravenous arginine were identical in the two groups. After oral glucose the insulin concentrations in plasma were lower and the concentrations of all proglucagon products were higher in the NIDDM group compared to the control group. The gel filtration analysis showed that arginine stimulated the secretion of pancreatic glucagon (PG 33-61), major proglucagon fragment (PG 72-158) and probably GLP-1 (PG 72-107 amide) in both groups, whereas oral glucose stimulated the secretion of glicentin (PG 1-69) and intestinal GLP-1 (PG 78-107 amide), an insulinotropic hormone. The elevated levels of immunoreactive GLP-1 in diabetics in the fasting state were mainly due to an increased concentration of major proglucagon fragment.\r"

  ".W": "It has been widely proposed that conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) to its free radical-producing form, xanthine oxidase (XOD), underlies ischemic/reperfusion injury, although the relationship of this conversion to hypoxia and its physiologic control have not been defined. This study details the time course and control of this enzymatic interconversion. In a functionally intact, isolated perfused rat liver model, mean % XOD activity increased as a function of both the duration (25 to 45% in 3 h) and degree (r = 0.97) of hypoxia. This process was markedly accelerated in ischemic liver by an overnight fast (45 vs. 30% at 2 h), and by imposing a short period of in vivo ischemia (cardiopulmonary arrest 72%). Moreover, only under these conditions was there a significant rise in the XOD activity due to the conformationally altered XDH molecule (XODc, 18%), as well as concomitant morphologic injury. Neither circulating white blood cells nor thrombosis appeared to contribute to the effects of in vivo ischemia on enzyme conversion. Thus, it is apparent that conversion to the free radical-producing state, with high levels of XOD activity and concurrent cellular injury, can be achieved during a relatively short period of hypoxia under certain well-defined physiologic conditions, in a time course consistent with its purported role in modulating reperfusion injury. These data also suggest that the premorbid condition of organ donors (e.g., nutritional status and relative state of hypoxia) is important in achieving optimal organ preservation.\r"

Advanced glycosylation end products, the glucose-derived moieties that form nonenzymatically and accumulate on long-lived tissue proteins, have been implicated in many of the complications of diabetes and normal aging. We demonstrate that advanced glycosylation products quench nitric oxide activity in vitro and in vivo. Acceleration of the advanced glycosylation process in vivo results in a time-dependent impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation. Inhibition of advanced glycosylation with aminoguanidine prevents nitric oxide quenching, and ameliorates the vasodilatory impairment. These results implicate advanced glycosylation products as important modulators of nitric oxide activity and endothelium-dependent relaxation.\r"

It is not known whether glucose plays an active role in generating these oscillations, or if an intrapancreatic pacemaker generates oscillations in insulin secretion that entrain glucose passively. To determine if the frequency of pulses of insulin secretion could be modified by oscillatory glucose infusion, seven normal men were studied on three separate occasions. The first study involved a constant glucose infusion administered at a rate of 6 mg/kg per min for 28 h. During the two subsequent studies, the subjects received an oscillatory glucose infusion for 28 h with the same mean rate, an amplitude of 33% above and below the mean infusion rate, a sinusoidal waveshape and a period either 20% longer (\"slow oscillatory infusion\") or 20% shorter (\"rapid oscillatory infusion\") than the periodicity observed during constant glucose infusion. Samples for insulin, C-peptide, and glucose were drawn at 10-min intervals during the last 24 h of each study. Insulin secretion rates were calculated by deconvolution of C-peptide levels. During constant glucose infusion, the respective periods of oscillation of glucose and insulin secretion averaged 126 +/- 5 min and 118 +/- 3 min (mean +/- SEM). During the slow oscillatory infusion, the period of infusion was 155 +/- 7 min and the periods of insulin secretion and glucose were, respectively, 155 +/- 7 min and 150 +/- 5 min. During rapid oscillatory infusion, the period of infusion was 103 +/- 5 min and the period of both insulin secretion and glucose was 105 +/- 5 min. Thus the periodicity of both insulin secretion and plasma glucose changed in parallel with the exogenous periodicity, indicating complete entrainment of the secretory oscillations. These results suggest that the ultradian oscillations of insulin secretion are caused by the feedback loop linking glucose and insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Much of the clinically important pathology associated with IgE-dependent disorders is thought to reflect the actions of the blood-borne leukocytes recruited during these responses. To evaluate the extent to which mast cells are responsible for the leukocyte infiltration associated with IgE-dependent cutaneous reactions, we attempted to elicit these responses in normal mice, genetically mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice, and in W/Wv mice selectively repaired of their mast cell deficiency by the intradermal injection of cultured mast cells derived from the congenic normal (+/+) mice. We found that the tissue swelling associated with IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions developed rapidly and diminished markedly from 2 to 4 h after antigen challenge, but remained detectable for at least 24 h after elicitation of the responses. Infiltration of leukocytes (predominantly neutrophils) also occurred at these sites, but reached maximal levels 6-12 h after antigen challenge, persisted at high levels for 24 h, and largely waned by 48 h. Virtually all of the tissue swelling and leukocyte infiltration associated with IgE-dependent cutaneous reactions was mast cell dependent. Intradermal injection of 40 U of recombinant murine TNF-alpha (rmTNF-alpha) elicited neutrophil infiltration similar in magnitude and kinetics to that observed after IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation. A rabbit anti-rmTNF-alpha (R anti-rmTNF-alpha) antiserum, which was able to inhibit 84% of the neutrophil infiltration observed after i.d. injection of rmTNF-alpha, inhibited IgE-, and mast cell-dependent leukocyte infiltration by 47 +/- 7% in three separate experiments. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha contributes to mast cell-dependent recruitment of leukocytes during IgE-dependent cutaneous late phase reactions, but suggest that other mast cell-associated mediators probably also contribute to this response.\r"

Here we report that in response to the essential amino acid L-tryptophan at lumenal concentrations likely to be supraphysiological (1 mM or greater), these responses are so exaggerated as to induce disruption of tight junctions and transepithelial macromolecular leaks. Since these effects of L-tryptophan are energy and Na+ dependent and occur with mucosal but not serosal exposure to L-tryptophan, it appears they are triggered by activation of a Na(+)-nutrient cotransporter in the apical membrane of absorptive cells rather than by the presence of an unidentified trace contaminant. Our findings suggest the possibility that dietary supplementation by L-tryptophan may result in loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier to dietary antigens. We speculate that such a response to supraphysiologic tryptophan may contribute, in part, to the recently recognized curious tryptophan-induced eosinophilia myalgia syndrome.\r"

Since the nephrotic syndrome has been associated with an increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that macrophages from nephrotic rats would accumulate cholesterol and undergo transformation into foam cells, with a concomitant increase in apoE biosynthesis. The nephrotic syndrome was induced in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside. Peritoneal macrophages exposed in vivo for 7-21 d to ascites fluid derived from plasma containing sixfold elevations of lipoproteins did not accumulate unesterified or esterified cholesterol. Nevertheless, immunoprecipitation assays after incubation of the isolated cells with [35S]methionine, or immunoblot analysis of the incubation medium demonstrated a 2.6-fold increase in apoE secretion compared with normal macrophages. This increase was accompanied by 5- to 10-fold increases in cellular apoE messenger RNA as determined by quantitative solution hybridization assay. Peritoneal macrophages cultured from nephrotic rats during the period of hypercholesterolemia also showed distinct and highly reproducible morphologic changes. The dissociation between apoE biosynthesis and macrophage cholesterol content provides new insight into the response of peritoneal macrophages in vivo to endogenous hyperlipemia.\r"

The molar concentrations of SLPI in total respiratory tract epithelial lining fluid (ELF) were 56 +/- 10% that of alpha 1-antitrypsin, suggesting SLPI may be more important for the anti-NE protection of the pulmonary epithelial surface than previously thought. However, evaluation demonstrated that SLPI in respiratory ELF was only one-third functional. Studies aerosolizing recombinant SLPI (rSLPI) to sheep demonstrated that in the short term, neither aerosolization and alveolar deposition nor the lavage procedure inactivated the SLPI molecule. In vitro studies with rSLPI demonstrated that exposure to oxidants did not modify the form of the molecule, while exposure to oxidants and NE caused the molecule to be cleaved from 12 to 8 kD. Consistent with this, evaluation of SLPI in lavage fluid of individuals with cystic fibrosis (a condition with oxidants and NE on the respiratory epithelium) showed that the SLPI was degraded. However, evaluation of SLPI in normal ELF by molecular sieve analysis and Western analysis demonstrated an intact 12-kD molecule, suggesting that the partial inactivation of SLPI in normals in vivo is not because it is complexed to NE or exposed to oxidants + NE. Together, these observations demonstrate that SLPI is present in large amounts in respiratory ELF, but since the majority of the SLPI is inactive, it likely does not play a significant role in protecting the normal respiratory epithelium, except perhaps in the upper airways where the levels of SLPI are the highest.\r"

To probe for the presence of the Mf and Mh defect in 19 unrelated families with GRTH, we applied separate polymerase chain reactions using allele-specific oligonucleotide primers containing the normal and each of the two mutant nucleotides at the 3'-position. A total of 24 affected subjects and 13 normal family members were studied. The mode of inheritance was dominant in 13 families, was unknown in 5 families, and was clearly recessive in 1 family in which only the consanguineous subjects were affected. Primers containing the substitutions specific for Mf and Mh amplified exons 7 and 8, respectively, only in affected members of each of the two index families. Primers containing the normal sequences amplified exons 7 and 8 of the TR beta gene in all subjects except affected members of one family. In this family with recessively inherited GRTH, neither exon could be amplified using any combinations of primers and DNA blot revealed absence of all coding exons. These results indicate a major deletion of the TR beta gene, including both DNA and hormone binding domains. Since heterozygous members of this family are not affected, the presence of a single normal allele is sufficient for normal function of the TR beta. These data also support the hypothesis that in the dominant mode of GRTH inheritance the presence of an abnormal TR beta interferes with the function of the normal TR beta. Distinct mutations are probably responsible for GRTH in unrelated families.\r"

Human brain aggregates were prepared from nine different brain specimens, and were treated with supernatants from in vitro HIV-infected macrophages (SI), uninfected macrophages (SU), infected T cells, or macrophage-conditioned media from four AIDS patients. Seven of nine treated brains exposed to SI showed peripheral rarefaction after 1 wk of incubation that by ultrastructural analysis showed cytoplasmic vacuolation. Aggregates from two of three brain cultures treated with SI for 3 wk became smaller, an approximately 50% decrease in size. The degree of apparent toxicity in brains exposed to patient-derived macrophage supernatants paralleled the proportion of macrophages found to be expressing HIV p24. Ultrastructural abnormalities were not observed in brains treated with supernatants from HIV-infected T cells, uninfected macrophages, or LPS-activated macrophages. Levels of five neurotransmitter amino acids were decreased in comparison to the structural amino acid leucine. These findings suggest that HIV-infected macrophages, infected both in vitro as well as derived from AIDS patients' peripheral blood, produce factors that cause reproducible histochemical, ultrastructural, and functional abnormalities in human brain aggregates.\r"

In this study we have investigated the possible applicability of mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated enzyme replacement therapy to correct the enzyme deficiency in the most affected tissues. Bovine testes acid alpha-glucosidase containing phosphorylated mannose residues was intravenously administered to mice and found to be taken up by heart (70% increase of activity) and skeletal muscle (43% increase); the major target organs. The uptake of nonphosphorylated human placenta acid alpha-glucosidase by heart and skeletal muscle appeared to be significantly less efficient, whereas uptake of dephosphorylated bovine testes enzyme was not detectable. The phosphorylated bovine testes acid alpha-glucosidase remained present in mouse skeletal muscle up to 9-15 d after administration, with a half-life of 2-4 d. Besides being measured in skeletal muscle and heart, uptake of phosphorylated bovine testes and nonphosphorylated human placenta acid alpha-glucosidase was measured in several other organs, but not in brain. The increase of acid alpha-glucosidase activity was highest in liver and spleen. We concluded that application of mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated enzyme replacement therapy may offer new perspectives for treatment of glycogenesis type II.\r"

  ".W": "Human cancers have an apparent low growth fraction, the bulk of cells presumed to being out of cycle in a G0 quiescent state due to the inability in the past to distinguish G0 from G1 cells. The allosteric M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (M1-RR) is constitutively expressed by cycling cells (i.e., G1, S, G2-M). It is acquired during transition from G0 to G1, lost during exit to G0 and thus distinguishes G0 from G1 cells. To estimate the proportion of G0 and G1 cells in primary human breast (n = 5) and colorectal (n = 12) adenocarcinomas, we used both analytical DNA flow cytometry (ADFC) and immunoperoxidase staining of sections with the monoclonal antibody to M1-RR (MAb M1-RR). ADFC of fresh tumors revealed a low percentage of cells in the S phase (4.0 +/- 3.4%) but immunoperoxidase staining for M1-RR revealed an unexpectedly high proportion of positive cells (52.4 +/- 12.7%) in the G1, S, G2-M phases indicating a high G1 content of primary human tumors. Thus, human cancers are blocked in transition in G1 and are not predominantly in a G0 or quiescent differentiated state. This block was interpreted to mean that human cancers are responding to putative regulatory events at a restriction point in the G1 phase, such as relative growth factor deficiency, density inhibition, antiproliferative cytokines, or gene products. Using flow cytometry for both DNA and M1-RR content we found that human colon cancer cell lines arrest in the G1 but not G0 phase upon serum deprivation or density inhibition. Similarly, human breast cancer cell lines are arrested in G1 but not G0 phase by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or tamoxifen exposure. These findings match our in situ observations, and support the concept of a restriction point block in primary human tumors.\r"

Both strains required opsonization with complement components in normal human serum in order for binding to occur. Binding of the acapsular, but not the encapsulated, strain led to phagocytosis. MAb directed against any of the three defined complement receptors (CR) on MO-M phi (CR1, CR3, and CR4) profoundly inhibited binding of serum-opsonized encapsulated (and to a lesser extent acapsular) organisms to MO-M phi. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated migration of CR to the area of the cryptococcal binding site. Trypsin and elastase inhibited binding of encapsulated and, to a lesser extent, acapsular yeasts to MO-M phi. Binding of encapsulated C. neoformans was profoundly inhibited by incubation in the cold or by inhibitors of receptor capping and actin microfilaments. Thus, multiple CR appear to contribute to binding of serum-opsonized encapsulated C. neoformans by MO-M phi. Binding is an energy-dependent process that requires conformational changes in actin yet does not lead to phagocytosis of the organism. In contrast, energy is not required for binding of acapsular yeasts by MO-M phi and binding triggers phagocytosis.\r"

In this system, T cells activated by immobilized anti-CD3 provide a potent stimulus for Ig production by adult lymphocytes. By contrast, anti-CD3 stimulation of cord blood lymphocytes generated minimal numbers of Ig-secreting cells. Ig production by neonatal lymphocytes was enhanced by the addition of Staphylococcus aureus or secreted factors from mitogen-stimulated adult T cells. Supplementation with IL-2 resulted in the production of large amounts of IgM and small amounts of IgG and IgA, with less Ig produced than by comparable cultures of adult lymphocytes. Neonatal T cells proliferated and produced IL-2 in response to immobilized anti-CD3, and supported B cell proliferation and Ig secretion by adult B cells, although not as effectively as adult T cells. Supernatants from activated neonatal T cells were markedly limited in their capacity to support Ig production by adult B cells. Neonatal B cells could be induced to differentiate in response to anti-CD3-stimulated adult T cells. However, the amounts of IgG and IgA secreted were small compared to adult levels. These studies indicate a relative, but not absolute, functional deficiency of both neonatal B and T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of protein metabolism in the human heart has not previously been studied. In 10 postabsorptive patients with coronary artery disease, heart protein synthesis and degradation were estimated simultaneously from the extraction of intravenously infused L-[ring-2,6-3H]phenylalanine (PHE) and the dilution of its specific activity across the heart at isotopic steady state. We subsequently examined the effect of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) infusion on heart protein turnover and on the myocardial balance of amino acids and branched chain ketoacids (BCKA) in these patients. In the postabsorptive state, there was a net release of phenylalanine (arterial-cardiac venous [PHE] = -1.71 +/- 0.32 nmol/ml, P less than 0.001; balance = -116 +/- 21 nmol PHE/min, P less than 0.001), reflecting protein degradation (142 +/- 40 nmol PHE/min) in excess of synthesis (24 +/- 42 nmol PHE/min) and net myocardial protein catabolism. During BCAA infusion, protein synthesis increased to equal the degradation rate (106 +/- 24 and 106 +/- 28 nmol PHE/min, respectively) and the phenylalanine balance shifted (P = 0.01) from negative to neutral (arterial-cardiac venous [PHE] = 0.07 +/- 0.36 nmol/ml; balance = 2 +/- 25 nmol PHE/min). BCAA infusion stimulated the myocardial uptake of both BCAA (P less than 0.005) and their ketoacid conjugates (P less than 0.001) in proportion to their circulating concentrations. Net uptake of the BCAA greatly exceeded that of other essential amino acids suggesting a role for BCAA and BCKA as metabolic fuels. Plasma insulin levels, cardiac double product, coronary blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were unchanged. These results demonstrate that the myocardium of postabsorptive humans is in negative protein balance and indicate a primary anabolic effect of BCAA on the human heart.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence is emerging for a direct role of glucose, independent of changes in insulin, in the regulation of cellular glucose transport and glucose utilization in vivo. In this study we investigate potential cellular and molecular mechanisms for this regulatory effect of glucose by determining how normalization of glycemia without insulin therapy in diabetic rats influences 3-O-methylglucose transport and the expression and translocation of two genetically distinct species of glucose transporters (GTs) in adipose cells. These results are compared with alterations in glucose disposal in vivo measured by euglycemic clamp. In rats rendered diabetic by 90% pancreatectomy, insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipose cells is decreased 50% in parallel with reduced insulin-mediated glucose disposal in vivo. Levels of adipose/muscle GTs measured by immunoblotting are decreased in adipose cell subcellular membrane fractions, as are the corresponding mRNA levels assessed by Northern blotting of total adipose cell RNA. Normalization of blood glucose in diabetic rats with phlorizin, which impairs renal tubular glucose reabsorption and thus enhances glucose excretion, restores insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipose cells and insulin-mediated glucose disposal in vivo. Importantly, levels of the adipose/muscle GT protein remain 43% reduced in the low-density microsomes in the basal state and 46% reduced in the plasma membranes in the insulin-stimulated state. Adipose/muscle GT mRNA levels remain approximately 50% depressed. Levels of the HepG2/brain GT protein and mRNA are unaltered by diabetes or phlorizin treatment. Thus, changes in ambient glucose independent of changes in ambient insulin can regulate the glucose transport response to insulin in isolated adipose cells and changes in responsiveness parallel alterations in glucose uptake in vivo. Since this effect can occur without alteration in the expression of the two species of glucose transporters present in adipose cells or in their translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin, it may result from changes in GT functional activity.\r"

We now demonstrate that intact erythrocytes modulate biochemical and functional responsiveness of activated platelets. A two-stage procedure, permitting studies of cell-cell interactions and independently evaluating platelet activation and recruitment within 1 min of stimulation, was developed. Erythrocytes increased platelet serotonin release despite aspirin treatment, enzymatic adenosine diphosphate removal, protease inhibition, or combinations thereof. The data suggested that erythrocyte enhancement of platelet reactivity can reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of aspirin. Erythrocytes metabolically modified platelet arachidonate or eicosapentaenoate release and eicosanoid formation. They promoted significant increases in cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites upon platelet stimulation with collagen or thrombin. However, with ionophore, erythrocytes strongly reduced platelet lipoxygenation. These erythrocyte modulatory effects were stimulus-specific. Activated platelet-erythrocyte mixtures, with or without aspirin, promoted 3-10-fold increases in extracellular free fatty acid, which would be available for transcellular metabolism. Erythrocyte-induced increases in free eicosapentaenoate may contribute to antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of this fish oil derivative. These results provide biochemical insight into erythrocyte contributions to thrombosis and hemostasis, and support the concept of thrombus formation as a multicellular event.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of increased cytosolic free calcium (Caf) in the pathogenesis of acute proximal tubule cell injury and the protection afforded by exposure to reduced medium pH or treatment with glycine, fura-2-loaded tubules were studied in suspension and singly in a superfusion system. The Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, increased Caf to micromolar levels and rapidly produced lethal cell injury as indicated by loss of lactate dehydrogenase to the medium by suspended tubules and accelerated leak of fura and failure to exclude Trypan blue by superfused tubules. Decreasing medium Ca2+ to 100 nM prevented the ionomycin-induced increases of Caf and the injury. Reducing medium pH from 7.4 to 6.9 or adding 2 mM glycine to the medium also prevented the cell death, but did not prevent the increase of Caf to micromolar levels. Cells treated with 1799, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation which produced severe adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, did not develop increases of Caf until just before loss of viability. Preventing these increases of Caf with 100 nM Ca2+ medium did not protect 1799-treated cells. Reduced pH and glycine protected 1799-treated cells without ameliorating the increases of Caf. These data demonstrate the toxic potential of increased Caf in the proximal tubule and show that Caf does sharply increase prior to loss of viability in an ATP depletion model of injury, but this increase does not necessarily contribute to the outcome. The potent protective actions of decreased pH and glycine allow the cells to sustain increases of Caf to micromolar levels in spite of severe, accompanying cellular ATP depletion without developing lethal cell injury.\r"

To clarify the mechanism of this change, we studied the kinetics of autologous 125I-LDL apolipoprotein B (apo B) in 41 normolipidemic, nonobese healthy males. For comparison, they were divided into three age groups: young, 21-39 yr (n = 18), middle-aged, 40-59 yr (n = 11), and old, 60-80 yr (n = 12). The levels of plasma LDL cholesterol and LDL apo B increased from respectively 3.4 +/- 0.1 (SEM) mmol/liter and 86 +/- 2 mg/dl in the young to 4.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter and 95 +/- 3 mg/dl in the old (P less than 0.01), and this increase was linked to a progressively decreased (r = -0.38, P less than 0.02) fractional catabolic rate of LDL apo B (0.348 +/- 0.010 pools per day in the young vs. 0.296 +/- 0.009 pools per day in the old, P less than 0.01). The production rate of LDL apo B did not differ significantly between the groups. The reduced fractional catabolic rate of LDL apo B in the old was not associated with a decrease in binding affinity of the LDL particle to its receptor, as judged from its ability to compete for 125I-LDL fibroblast binding. When hepatic LDL receptor expression was stimulated by cholestyramine treatment in six old males, their LDL apo B fractional catabolic rate increased to the levels observed in the young subjects. We conclude that the increase in LDL which normally occurs with age is explained by a reduced capacity for its removal, and hypothesize that this is mediated via a reduced hepatic LDL receptor expression.\r"

Ascorbate is an important water-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant in humans. Probucol, a lipid-soluble antioxidant drug has been shown to retard the progression of atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of probucol and physiologic levels of ascorbate on the oxidative modification of LDL in both a cell-free (2.5 microM Cu++ in phosphate-buffered saline) and cellular system (human monocyte macrophages in Ham's F-10 medium). Both ascorbate and probucol inhibited the oxidative modification of LDL in both systems to a similar degree as evidenced by the thiobarbituric acid-reacting substance activity, electrophoretic mobility, and degradation by macrophages. However, whereas co-incubation with physiologic levels of ascorbate resulted in a substantial preservation of the alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, and beta-carotene of the LDL, probucol in concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 microM failed to protect these antioxidants. Thus, in addition to being as potent as probucol in inhibiting the oxidation of LDL, ascorbate in contrast preserves the endogenous antioxidants in the LDL.\r"

The present study tested whether IL-1 activates guanylate cyclase by inducing prolonged production of nitric oxide in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). IL-1 induced a marked time-dependent increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in VSMC which was significant at 6 h, and increased progressively for up to 36 h. This effect of IL-1 was abolished when protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide or actinomycin D, suggesting that the effect of IL-1 involves new protein synthesis. IL-1-induced cGMP accumulation was inhibited by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitors, methylene blue, LY83583, and hemoglobin and by the L-arginine analogue NGmonomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). The inhibitory effect of L-NMMA was reversed by a 10-fold excess of L-arginine, but not by D-arginine. Nitrite, an oxidation product of nitric oxide, accumulated in the media of VSMC incubated with IL-1 for 24 h in the presence of L-arginine, whereas both IL-1-induced cGMP accumulation and nitrite production were attenuated in VSMC incubated in L-arginine-deficient medium. In L-arginine-depleted VSMC, IL-1-induced cGMP accumulation was restored to control levels by a 15-min incubation with L-arginine. These results demonstrate that IL-1 activates guanylate cyclase in rat VSMC by inducing production of nitric oxide via a pathway dependent on extracellular L-arginine.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD18, CD11a, CD11b, and neutrophil lectin adhesion molecule 1 (LECAM-1), i.e., the human homologue of the murine MEL-14 antigen, were used to assess the relative contribution of these glycoproteins to neutrophil-endothelial adhesion. Under static conditions, the adhesion of neutrophils to IL-1-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers was inhibited by antibodies to CD18, CD11a, and the neutrophil LECAM-1, and the effect of combining anti-LECAM-1 and anti-CD11a was almost additive. Under flow at a wall shear stress 1.85 dyn/cm2, a condition where CD18-dependent adhesion is minimal, anti-LECAM-1 inhibited adhesion by greater than 50%. Chemotactic stimulation of neutrophils induced a rapid loss of LECAM-1 from the neutrophil surface, and the level of neutrophil surface LECAM-1 was closely correlated with adhesion under flow. Neutrophils contacting the activated endothelial cells for 30 min lost much of their surface LECAM-1, a phenomenon induced by a soluble factor or factors released into the medium by the stimulated monolayers, and a high percentage migrated through the HUVEC monolayer. This migration was almost completely inhibited by anti-CD18, but was unaffected by antibodies to neutrophil LECAM-1. These results support the concept that LECAM-1 is a neutrophil adhesion molecule that participates in the adherence of unstimulated neutrophils to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells under conditions of flow, and is then lost from the neutrophil surface coincident with the engagement of CD18-dependent mechanisms leading to transendothelial migration.\r"

Although mast cells are known to both release and generate proinflammatory molecules in response to inflammatory stimuli, little is known about their normal biologic function. Here we demonstrate that IL-3-dependent mouse PT18 mast cells, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, and rat basophilic leukemia cells express large amounts of mRNA for collagen IV, laminin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Western blot analysis confirmed that mast cells synthesize and secrete significant amounts collagen IV and laminin B1 and B2 chains. These data suggest that mast cells may contribute to normal tissue repair and/or the early overproduction of basement membrane components seen in a variety of fibrotic conditions.\r"

Rats were injected weekly with diluent or DMH at 20 mg/kg body wt for 5, 10, 15, or 25 wk, killed, and their colons dissected. DNA was extracted from diluent-injected control animals, histologically normal colonic mucosa from carcinogen-treated animals, and from carcinomas. Ras mutations were characterized by differential hybridization using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes to polymerase chain reaction--amplified DNA, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. While no H-ras mutations were detectable in any group, K-ras (G to A) mutations were found in 66% of DMH-induced colon carcinomas. These mutations were at the second nucleotide of codons 12 or 13 or the first nucleotide of codon 59 of the K-ras gene. The same type of K-ras mutations were observed in premalignant colonic mucosa from 2 out of 11 rats as early as 15 wk after beginning carcinogen injections when no dysplasia, adenomas, or carcinomas were histologically evident, suggesting that ras mutation may be an early event in colon carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "In the intact rat kidney, bicarbonate reabsorption in the early proximal tubule (EP) is strongly dependent on delivery. Independent of delivery, metabolic acidosis stimulates EP bicarbonate reabsorption. In this study, we investigated whether systemic pH changes induced by acute or chronic respiratory acid-base disorders also affect EP HCO3- reabsorption, independent of delivery (FLHCO3, filtered load of bicarbonate). Hypercapnia was induced in rats acutely (1-3 h) and chronically (4-5 d) by increasing inspired PCO2. Hypocapnia was induced acutely (1-3 h) by mechanical hyperventilation, and chronically (4-5 d) using hypoxemia to stimulate ventilation. When compared with normocapneic rats with similar FLHCO3, no stimulation of EP or overall proximal HCO3 reabsorption was found with either acute hypercapnia (PaCO2 = 74 mmHg, pH = 7.23) or chronic hypercapnia (PaCO2 = 84 mmHg, pH = 7.31). Acute hypocapnia (PaCO2 = 29 mmHg, pH = 7.56) did not suppress EP or overall HCO3 reabsorption. Chronic hypocapnia (PaCO2 = 26 mmHg, pH = 7.54) reduced proximal HCO3 reabsorption, but this effect was reversed when FLHCO3 was increased to levels comparable to euvolemic normocapneic rats. Thus, when delivery is accounted for, we could find no additional stimulation of proximal bicarbonate reabsorption in respiratory acidosis and, except at low delivery rates, no reduction in bicarbonate reabsorption in respiratory alkalosis.\r"

Due to its low solubility and oxygen affinity, Hb S Antilles has a greater propensity to cause red cell sickling than Hb S. To make transgenic animals that express a high level of Hb S Antilles, the erythroid-specific DNAse I hypersensitive site II from the human beta-globin cluster was linked independently to the human alpha 2-globin gene and to the beta S Antilles gene. Embryos were injected with both constructs simultaneously and seven transgenic mice were obtained, three of which contained both the human alpha and the human beta S Antilles transgene. After crossing the human transgenes into the mouse beta-thalassemic background a transgenic mouse line was derived in which approximately half the beta-globin chains in the murine red cells were human beta S Antilles. Deoxygenation of the transgenic red cells in vitro resulted in extensive sickling. An increase of in vivo sickling was achieved by placing these transgenic mice in a low oxygen environment. This murine model for red cell sickling should help to advance our understanding of sickle cell disease and may provide a model to test therapeutic interventions.\r"

IGF-II mRNA is expressed at high levels in the adrenal cortex before birth but it is not detectable until after birth in the adrenal medulla. Neuroblastoma cell lines corresponding to early adrenal medullary precursors did not express IGF-II, although all three cell lines we tested were growth stimulated by IGF-II. Cell lines corresponding to more mature adrenal medullary cells expressed IGF-II, and one, SK-N-AS, grows by an IGF-II autocrine mechanism (J. Clin. Invest. 84:829-839) El-Badry, Romanus, Helman, Cooper, Rechler, and Israel. 1989. An examination of human neuroblastoma tumor tissues for IGF-II gene expression using in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that IGF-II is expressed by tumor cells in only 5 of 21 neuroblastomas, but is detectable in cells of nonmalignant tissues including adrenal cortical cells, stromal fibroblasts, and eosinophils in all 21 tumors. These findings indicate that IGF-II may function as an autocrine growth factor for some neuroblastomas and as a paracrine growth factor for others. They suggest that the growth regulatory pathways utilized by neuroblastoma mimic those used in the precursor cell type from which individual tumors arise.\r"

We demonstrate that SCID mice reconstituted with PBMC support the growth and differentiation of a restricted set of B cells. Human IgG levels of 1-2 mg/ml (10-20% of normal human serum levels) were routinely achieved in spite of a serum half life of only 12 d. Ig levels peaked around 50 d and Ig production was maintained for greater than 100 d. The Ig was greater than 85% IgG though some IgM, IgA, IgD, and even IgE could be detected. However, the human IgG produced in hu-PBL-SCID mice was pauci-clonal when analyzed by isoelectric focusing and by kappa/lambda light chain usage. Using a new polymerase chain reaction based analysis capable of monitoring individual VH family utilization, we found that the engrafted B cells showed skewed and restricted human VH subfamily utilization. These parameters were markedly variable among hu-PBL-SCID mice reconstituted from the same donor cell population at both early (21-50 d) and late stages (greater than 100 d). Hu-PBL/CVI-SCID mice constructed with cells from patients with common variable immunodeficiency with an in vitro block in terminal B cell differentiation produced human Ig responses that were quantitatively the same as those produced by hu-PBL-SCID mice from normal donors. The hu-PBL-SCID system using PBMC appears to lead to growth and Ig production by a small number of B cells and results in a restricted B cell repertoire.\r"

There were 22 cases of alpha beta, 5 cases of gamma delta, and 10 cases of silent TCR expressing neither the alpha beta nor gamma delta TCR. 5 different probes were used to examine the delta locus. The 22 cases of alpha beta PTCL displayed biallelic and monoallelic deletions; a monoallelic V delta 1 J delta 1 rearrangement was observed in 1 case and a monoallelic germ line configuration in 7 cases. The 5 cases of gamma delta PTCL displayed biallelic rearrangements: the productive rearrangements could be ascribed to V delta 1J delta 1 joining in 3 cases and VJ delta 1 joining in 2 cases according to the combined pattern of DNA hybridization with the appropriate probes and of cell reactivity with the TCR delta-1, delta TCS-1, and anti-V delta 2 monoclonal antibodies. In the VJ delta 1 joining, the rearranged V segments were located between V delta 1 and V delta 2. Interestingly, in the third group of 10 cases of silent PTCL, 5 cases were found to have a TCR gene configuration identical to that in the TCR alpha beta PTCL, as demonstrated by biallelic delta gene deletion. These 5 cases were CD3 positive. The 5 remaining cases showed a monoallelic delta gene rearrangement with a monoallelic germ line configuration in 4 and a monoallelic deletion in 1. Four of these cases were CD3 negative, which was consistent with an immature genotype the TCR commitent of which could not be ascertained. Finally, TCR gamma delta PTCL consisted of a distinct clinical morphological and molecular entity whereas TCR alpha beta and silent PTCL had a similar presentation.\r"

Our previous studies of the first reported kindred showed a two- to threefold reduction in glucocorticoid receptor-ligand binding affinity in the propositus, and a lesser reduction in affinity in his mildly affected son and nephew. Glucocorticoid receptor cDNA from these three patients was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The cDNA nucleotide sequence was normal, except for nucleotide 2054, which substituted valine for aspartic acid at amino acid residue 641. The propositus was homozygous while the other relatives were heterozygous for the mutation. COS-7 monkey kidney cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for either wild type or Val 641-mutant receptors, together with the reporter plasmid pMMTV-CAT. Dexamethasone increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in cells expressing wild type receptor, but had no effect in cells expressing Val 641-mutant receptors, despite similar receptor concentrations, as indicated by Western blotting. The binding affinity for dexamethasone of the Val 641-mutant receptor was threefold lower than that of the wild type receptor. These results suggest that glucocorticoid resistance in this family is due to a point mutation in the steroid-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of mast cells in transport abnormalities during intestinal anaphylaxis, we examined responses to antigen in isolated intestinal preparations from ovalbumin-sensitized genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv (W/Wv) mice and congenic normal WBBGF1(-)+/+ (+/+) mice. Changes in ion transport (primarily secretion of chloride ions) were indicated by increases in short-circuit current (Isc). In tissues from +/+ mice, antigen caused increases in Isc which were significantly inhibited by antagonists to histamine (diphenhydramine) and serotonin (ketanserin), by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (piroxicam) and by a neurotoxin (tetrodotoxin). In preparations from W/Wv mice, antigen-stimulated responses were approximately 30% of that in +/+ mice and were inhibited only by piroxicam. Responses to electrical transmural stimulation of nerves were approximately 50% in W/Wv versus +/+ mice, and were inhibited by antagonists of mast cell mediators in +/+ but not W/Wv mice. Reconstitution of mast cells in W/Wv mice by intravenous injection of +/+ bone marrow cells restored the normal responses to both antigen and nerve stimulation. Our results indicate that mast cell-dependent mechanisms are primarily responsible for the ion secretion associated with intestinal anaphylaxis, but that other cells are also involved. In addition, our data provide evidence for the functional importance of bidirectional communication between nerves and mast cells in the regulation of ion transport in the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

We investigated the influence of four growth factors on the rates of healing of a novel full thickness dermal ulcer placed on an avascular base in the rabbit ear. The wound model precludes significant wound contraction and requires new granulation tissue and epithelial cells for healing to originate centripetally. 5 micrograms (7-31 pmol/mm2) of platelet-derived growth factor-B chain (PDGF-BB), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) applied locally at the time of wounding resulted in a twofold increase in complete reepithelialization of treated wounds (PDGF-BB, P = 0.02 chi square analysis; bFGF, P = 0.04; EGF, P = 0.05); transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 significantly inhibited reepithelialization (P = 0.05). Both PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 uniquely increased the depth and area of new granulation tissue (P less than 0.005), the influx of fibroblasts, and the deposition of new matrix into wounds. Explants from 7-d old PDGF-BB-treated wounds remained metabolically far more active than controls, incorporating 473% more [3H]thymidine into DNA (P = 0.05) and significantly more [3H]leucine and [3H]proline into collagenase-sensitive protein (P = 0.04). The results establish that polypeptide growth factors have significant and selective positive influences on healing of full thickness ulcers in the rabbit.\r"

A control dog treated with recombinant canine G-CSF (rcG-CSF) showed persistent neutrophilia over 3 mo. Serum from dogs during neutropenia contained an antibody to rhG-CSF, which neutralized the stimulatory effects of both rhG-CSF and rcG-CSF on dog marrow neutrophilic progenitor cell growth and on NFS-60 cell proliferation. 4 mo after discontinuation of rhG-CSF, the dogs' neutrophil counts returned to the normal range. Rechallenge with the rhG-CSF re-induced severe neutropenia in 1 wk. Neutropenia was transferred by plasma infusion from a neutropenic dog to a previously normal dog. These data suggest that human rhG-CSF immunizes normal dogs and thereby induces neutralization of endogenous canine G-CSF and neutropenia. This model system should allow more precise definition of the in vivo role of G-CSF.\r"

Heat shock of human islet cells in vitro markedly increased the synthesis of proteins of 72,000, 75,000, and 90,000 Mr. No autoantibodies reactive to these hsp, nor to the constituently expressed islet cell hsp 65 protein (identified as 60,000 Mr) were observed in IDD patients.

The AVP-NPII gene, locating on chromosome 20, consists of three exons that encode putative signal peptide, AVP, NPII, and glycoprotein. Using polymerase chain reaction, fragments including the promoter region and all coding regions were amplified from genomic DNA and subjected to direct sequencing. Sequences of 10 patients with IDI were identical with those of normals, while in 2 patients with FDI, a single base substitution was detected in one of two alleles of the AVP-NPII gene, indicating they were heterozygotes for this mutation. It was a G----A transition at nucleotide position 1859 in the second exon, resulting in a substitution of Gly for Ser at amino acid position 57 in the NPII moiety.

  ".U": "91123476\r", 
  ".W": "Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by subepidermal vesicles and the presence of autoantibodies directed against the epidermal basement membrane zone. Previous studies have identified two protein components of the hemidesmosome, BP180 and BP230, as the primary antigenic targets of BP autoantibodies. We have recently reported the isolation of a 1.0-kb BP180 cDNA. Sequence analysis presented in this report reveals that this partial BP180 cDNA encodes two protein domains which have primary structures that are characteristic of the triple helical domains of collagens, i.e., glycine appears at every third position and over one-third of the remaining residues are proline. The two collagen domains have lengths of 242 and 30 amino acids and are separated by a noncollagen stretch of 12 amino acids. Collagenase digestion of the BP180 cDNA-encoded fusion protein generated a peptide fragment with a size that was consistent with the predicted locations of the collagenase digestion sites. A possible physiological function for the collagen domains of the BP180 hemidesmosomal protein may be to form stable interactions with constituents of the extracellular matrix of the cutaneous basement membrane zone. Such interactions may provide the molecular framework for the adhesion between the basal keratinocyte and the basal lamina.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the mechanism of action of an intestinal secretagogue, serotonin, we have isolated crypt and villus cells and demonstrated Na:H and Cl:HCO3 exchange activity using the intracellular pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2,7-bis (carboxy-ethyl)-5,6-carboxy-fluorescein. Serotonin alkalinized both crypt and villus cells. Alkalinization in villus cells was HCO3 dependent and Na independent. In contrast, alkalinization in crypt cells was HCO3 independent and Na dependent. In villus cells, recovery from an alkaline load induced by Cl removal, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid or propionate pulse, known to occur via the Cl:HCO3 exchange, is inhibited by serotonin. In contrast, in crypt cells, recovery from an acid load induced by Na removal, amiloride and NH4Cl pulse, known to occur via Na:H exchange, is stimulated by serotonin. These data suggest that serotonin is inhibiting Cl:HCO3 exchange in villus cells and stimulating Na:H exchange in crypt cells. These effects of serotonin would be expected to inhibit coupled Na and Cl absorption by villus cells and stimulate HCO3 secretion by crypt cells in the intact ileum.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian proximal tubule is an important mediator of the renal adaptive response to systemic acidosis. In chronic metabolic and respiratory acidosis the bicarbonate reabsorptive (or proton secretory) capacity is increased. This increase is mediated, at least in part, by an increase in Vmax of the luminal Na/H antiporter. To determine whether this adaptation involves increased mRNA expression, Na/H antiporter mRNA levels were measured by Northern analysis in renal cortex of rats with metabolic (6 mmol/kg body wt NH4Cl for 2 or 5 d) and respiratory (10% CO2/air balanced for 2 or 5 d) acidosis and of normal, pair-fed rats. Na/H antiporter mRNA levels were unchanged after 2 d of both metabolic and respiratory acidosis. After 5 d, however, Na/H antiporter mRNA expression was increased 1.76 +/- 0.12-fold in response to metabolic acidosis (P less than 0.005, n = 8), but was not different from normal in response to respiratory acidosis: 1.1 +/- 0.2 (NS, n = 8). Thus, the renal adaptive response to metabolic acidosis involves increased cortical Na/H antiporter mRNA levels. In contrast, the enhanced proximal tubule Na/H antiporter activity and bicarbonate reabsorption in respiratory acidosis seem to involve mechanisms other than increased Na/H antiporter gene expression.\r"

Mean tumor size was 2.1 cm. Of the tumors, 70.4% arose in the mid-face region, 55.6% had undergone multiple previous treatment modalities. The present recurrence rate is 7.4% (mean follow-up: 25 months). Basal cell carcinoma recurring following radiotherapy deserves special subclassification among recurrent BCC. It is very difficult to eradicate, with high recurrence rates following standard surgical excision or further radiotherapy. Tumors are usually large, aggressive, and invasive. Most arise in the cosmetically crucial mid-face region, where extension into subcutaneous tissue planes is common. Mohs surgery, with its inherent abilities to examine all margins, map tumor extension, and conserve tissue, is uniquely suited to treatment of these difficult tumors.\r"

Seventeen patients (4.8%) developed malignant melanomas during an average follow-up period of 49 months. One patient developed two malignant melanomas. Eight of the malignant melanomas detected were in situ and ten were invasive melanomas (less than 0.86 mm in Breslow thickness), implying an excellent prognosis. The number of malignant melanomas detected in these patients exceeded significantly the number expected to occur in age- and sex-matched white controls. All groups were shown to have an increased risk for the development of malignant melanomas. Total-body photographs were helpful in detecting changes in size, shape, and color that led to the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. These data support the concept that patients with this readily regionalized clinical presentation of classic atypical-mole syndrome are at an increased risk for malignant melanomas and, therefore, should be examined regularly.\r"

During a mean follow-up period of 35 months, 14 patients died of causes attributed to aortic stenosis and 21 underwent aortic valve replacement. The estimated probability for remaining free of any complication of aortic stenosis at the end of the first 4 years was 59%. Symptomatic patients with decreased ejection fraction or hemodynamic evidence of left ventricular decompensation were at greater risk for these complications. It is concluded that patients with moderate aortic stenosis are at significant risk for the development of complications.\r"

Thirty-two patients (Group I) had sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias 8 to 60 days (mean 13 +/- 9) after acute myocardial infarction. The remaining 76 patients (Group II), who served as a control group, had no sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias less than or equal to 60 days after infarction. The most significant independent determinants of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias late after infarction were the presence of late potentials (chi square = 16.07, p = 0.0001), defined as an abnormal signal-averaged QRS complex in association with an abnormal root-mean-square voltage in the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex, and an abnormal ejection fraction of less than 40% (chi square = 10.09, p = 0.001). Sustained ventricular tachycardia was induced in 27 (96%) of 28 Group I patients. Among the 32 patients in Group I, antitachycardia therapy included antiarrhythmic drug therapy as the sole preventive measure in 14 (44%); map-guided surgery or coronary artery bypass surgery, or both, in 14 (44%) and the automatic cardioverter-defibrillator in 4 (12%). The arrhythmias were rendered noninducible in 83% of patients after map-guided surgery and in 41% after drug therapy. During a follow-up period of 20 +/- 14 months, five Group I patients (15%) had an arrhythmic event and four (9.3%) had a cardiac-related death. All five patients who had an arrhythmic event were receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

H1 receptor stimulation of the coronary artery was performed with a selective intracoronary infusion of histamine (2 micrograms/min) in 21 patients with variant angina after blockade of the H2 receptor with cimetidine (25 mg/kg) and its effect on the coronary artery diameter was examined. Intracoronary injection of acetylcholine was also performed in 19 of the 21 patients. Ergonovine (0.2 mg) was intravenously administered in one patient. The coronary artery diameter was measured with cinevideodensitometric analysis. A mean plasma histamine concentration in the coronary sinus increased from 4 x 10(-9) to 7 x 10(-8) M 5 min after histamine infusion into the left coronary artery (n = 18). Coronary spasm was induced in 6 patients (29%) with histamine, in 18 (95%) with acetylcholine and in 1 with ergonovine. The effect of histamine on the luminal diameter was analyzed at the site of spasm in the 26 coronary arteries in which spasm was induced by acetylcholine or ergonovine. Of the 20 coronary arteries with a normal arteriogram or a fixed stenosis less than or equal to 50% of luminal diameter, histamine decreased the diameter in 4, increased it in 14 (70%) and caused no change in 2; of the 6 coronary arteries with a fixed stenosis greater than or equal to 75%, histamine decreased the diameter in 5 and increased it in 1. In the coronary arteries in which spasm was not induced by either acetylcholine or ergonovine, histamine increased the diameter, especially in those without advanced atherosclerosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the extent of jeopardized myocardium in patients with single vessel coronary artery disease of variable severity and location, quantitative exercise thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography was performed in 158 consecutive patients with angiographically proved single vessel coronary artery disease. The extent of abnormal left ventricular perfusion was quantified from computer-generated polar maps of three-dimensional myocardial radioactivity. Patients with only a moderate (51% to 69%) stenosis tended to have a small perfusion defect irrespective of the coronary artery involved. Whereas a perfusion defect measuring greater than or equal to 10% of the left ventricle was found in 78% of patients with no prior infarction and severe (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis, this was observed in only 24% of patients with moderate stenosis. Perfusion defect size increased with increasing severity of stenosis for the entire group without infarction and for those with left anterior descending, right and circumflex coronary artery stenosis. However, the correlation between stenosis severity and perfusion defect size was at best only modest (r = 0.38, p = 0.0001). The left anterior descending artery was shown to be the most important of the three coronary arteries for providing left ventricular perfusion. Proximal stenosis of this artery produced a perfusion defect approximately twice as large as that found in patients with a proximal right or circumflex artery stenosis. However, marked heterogeneity in perfusion defect size existed among all three vessels despite comparable stenosis severity. This was most apparent for the left anterior descending coronary artery, where mid vessel stenosis commonly produced a perfusion defect similar in size to that found in proximally stenosed vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Its kinetics, especially its lack of redistribution after intravenous administration, permits the assessment of changes in myocardial perfusion without delay of therapy. Tomographic images at rest were obtained immediately and 6 to 10 days later in 17 consecutive patients undergoing successful primary angioplasty during their first transmural myocardial infarction. Thirteen patients had anterior infarction. The initial (acute) defect size before angioplasty of 48 +/- 17% of the left ventricle decreased significantly (p less than 0.0001) to 29 +/- 19% on the late scans. There was no correlation between the time to therapy and the reduction in defect size. Twelve of the 17 patients, including 7 of the 11 patients treated after 4 h, demonstrated a definite reduction in the initial defect size. Eight patients with angiographically proved persistent coronary occlusion underwent a similar imaging sequence. The initial defect size in this group remained unchanged on the late scans (24 +/- 16% versus 26 +/- 18%, p = NS). Primary angioplasty is an effective approach toward salvaging myocardium; comparison with thrombolytic drug therapy must await the results of controlled clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if imaging of blood flow (using N-13 ammonia) and glucose metabolism (using F-18 2-deoxyglucose) with positron emission tomography can distinguish cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease from nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, 21 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction who were evaluated for cardiac transplantation were studied. The origin of left ventricular dysfunction had been previously determined by coronary angiography to be ischemic (11 patients) or nonischemic (10 patients). Images were visually analyzed by three observers on a graded scale in seven left ventricular segments and revealed fewer defects in dilated cardiomyopathy compared with ischemic cardiomyopathy for N-13 ammonia (2.7 +/- 1.6 versus 5 +/- 0.6; p less than 0.03) and F-18 deoxyglucose (2.8 +/- 2.1 versus 4.6 +/- 1.1; p less than 0.03). An index incorporating extent and severity of defects revealed more homogeneity with fewer and less severe defects in subjects with nonischemic than in those with ischemic cardiomyopathy as assessed by imaging of flow (2.8 +/- 1.8 versus 9.2 +/- 3; p less than 0.001) and metabolism (3.8 +/- 3.3 versus 8.5 +/- 3.6; p less than 0.005). Diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing the two subgroups by visual image analysis was 85%. Using previously published circumferential count profile criteria, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy had fewer ischemic segments (0.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.5 +/- 2 per patient; p less than 0.01) and infarcted segments (0.1 +/- 0.3 versus 2.4 +/- 1.4 per patient; p less than 0.001) than did patients with cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease. The sensitivity for differentiating the two clinical subgroups using circumferential profile analysis was 100% and the specificity 80%. An index incorporating both number and severity of defects derived from circumferential profile analysis was significantly lower in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy than in ischemic cardiomyopathy (0.3 +/- 0.8 versus 2.7 +/- 2.4; p less than 0.005). Thus, noninvasive positron emission tomographic imaging with N-13 ammonia and F-18 deoxyglucose is helpful in distinguishing patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease from those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and a semiquantitative index such as circumferential profile analysis is superior to that of visual analysis alone.\r"

Baseline clinical and angiographic variables were similar in the iopamidol (n = 155) and diatrizoate (n = 152) groups. Change in renal function after angiography was less pronounced with iopamidol compared with diatrizoate as measured by mean ( +/- SD) increase in 24 h serum creatinine (0.11 +/- 0.2 versus 0.22 +/- 0.26 mg/dl, p less than 0.001), mean maximal increase in serum creatinine (0.2 +/- 0.44 versus 0.38 +/- 0.73 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001) and percent of patients with a maximal increase in serum creatinine greater than 0.5 mg/dl (8% versus 19%, p less than 0.01). Such differences could not be documented in diabetic patients using insulin. There was no significant difference between agents in the number of patients developing clinically severe acute renal dysfunction. It is concluded that iopamidol is less nephrotoxic than diatrizoate in high risk patients at cardiac angiography. However, the difference in nephrotoxicity is small, of no major clinical significance in the majority of high risk patients and could not be documented in insulin-using diabetic patients. Iopamidol may be the preferred agent in certain patients with advanced renal impairment, but further study is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "To determine how many electropharmacologic drug trials should be performed to select therapy for patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the outcome of 150 consecutive patients with inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias undergoing serial electropharmacologic testing was examined. The probability of identifying predicted effective therapy (inductive of fewer than five ventricular responses with three ventricular extrastimuli at three pacing cycle lengths) and the probability of that therapy preventing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia recurrences were determined as a function of the number of preceding trials. The probability ( +/- SE) of identifying predicted effective therapy by the first trial (0.23 +/- 0.03) was significantly higher than that of the second (0.09 +/- 0.04), third (0.08 +/- 0.04) and fourth (0.05 +/- 0.04) trials (p = 0.001). No patient had predicted effective therapy identified by subsequent trials. The 2 year actuarial probability of freedom from sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias on predicted effective therapy was higher for the first (0.79 +/- 0.08), second (0.73 +/- 0.13) and third (0.86 +/- 0.13) trials than for the fourth (0.33 +/- 0.27) trial (p = 0.02). Thus, the probability of selecting therapy with long-term efficacy was highest for the first trial (0.18), intermediate for the second (0.07) and third (0.07) trials and lowest for the fourth (0.02) and subsequent (0.00) trials. Accordingly, the electropharmacologic approach to therapy selection should be abandoned after three unsuccessful trials.\r"

It has therefore been suggested that the tachycardia circuit involves retrograde conduction up an accessory pathway located in perinodal tissue. If the mechanism of surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is interruption of this accessory pathway, postoperative changes in retrograde conduction would be expected. Thirteen patients with drug-refractory AV node reentrant tachycardia underwent surgery. Preoperatively, H2A2 intervals were short and constant. During AV node reentrant tachycardia, earliest atrial activation was seen near the His bundle and was 0 to 25 ms before ventricular activation in all patients except one. Surgery consisted of dissection of right atrial septal and anterior inputs to the AV node and central fibrous body. Postoperatively, the H2A2 interval remained short and constant compared with preoperative values although it was slightly prolonged (74 +/- 18 versus 61 +/- 21 ms, p less than 0.005). Twelve of the 13 patients are free of tachycardia after 28 +/- 13 months and no patient has had evidence of AV node block. Thus, surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is highly successful; however, there is no reason to postulate an accessory pathway or use of perinodal tissue as part of the tachycardia circuit and the mechanism of surgical success remains obscure.\r"

The criteria for an abnormal atrial electrogram were defined as a duration of greater than or equal to 100 ms or eight or more fragmented deflections, or both.

Variations in cycle length, time to stable cycle length and the range of RR intervals during ventricular tachycardia were analyzed in 74 episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in patients not taking antiarrhythmic medication. Linear regression demonstrated cycle length variability to decrease over time (41 +/- 24 to 17 +/- 19 ms, p less than 0.001). Slower ventricular tachycardia had more cycle length variability than faster ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Ventricular tachycardia that was initially more variable tended to remain more variable (p less than 0.001). Fifty-four percent of episodes stabilized within the first 15 beats, 75% by 30 beats and 93% by 50 beats. The number of beats to stable cycle length was independent of ventricular tachycardia rate. The average range in cycle length per episode was 127 +/- 72 ms; 12% of ventricular tachycardia episodes varied by less than 50 ms and 45% by less than 150 ms. The maximal range in RR intervals from a single episode of ventricular tachycardia was 290 ms. Therefore, ventricular tachycardia demonstrates a wide range of cycle lengths and has time-dependent changes in variability and stability. These cycle length changes should be considered in the algorithms for ventricular tachycardia detection and termination by automatic antitachycardia devices.\r"

Ten patients requiring a cardioverter-defibrillator for recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (five patients) or aborted sudden cardiac death (five patients) were evaluated for implantation of this lead system. A lead configuration with a bidirectional defibrillating current pathway was implanted in nine patients. The defibrillation threshold with this lead configuration was 15 J in five patients, 20 J in three and 30 to 35 J in one patient. In the remaining patient the lead system had a 40 J defibrillation threshold and was not implanted. No perioperative complications occurred. Induced ventricular fibrillation was successfully terminated at the predischarge and intermediate follow-up (8 to 12 weeks) electrophysiologic studies. During the follow-up period, there were three deaths (one sudden, two due to heart failure) and two lead system failures (oversensing with inappropriate shocks in one patient and patch lead fracture in another). Implantation of the cardioverter-defibrillator lead system by a nonthoracotomy approach is feasible, has no significant perioperative complications and is well tolerated by patients. Effective defibrillation was demonstrated immediately as well as at intermediate follow-up study. The occurrence of patch lead fracture and oversensing requires improvement in the present (nonthoracotomy) lead system technology.\r"

Thirty-four lesions were dilated and the interval between coronary angioplasty and death ranged from several hours to 4 years. Intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cells, as a major cause of restenosis, was observed in 83% to 100% of 28 lesions examined 11 days to 2 years after coronary angioplasty. In 20 lesions examined within 6 months, proliferating smooth muscle cells were predominantly of the synthetic type and there was abundant extracellular matrix substance chiefly composed of proteoglycans. In eight lesions examined between 6 months and 2 years, contractile type smooth muscle cells were dominant and extracellular matrix was composed chiefly of collagen. In three lesions examined after 2 years, evidence of antemortem coronary angioplasty was hardly identifiable and these lesions were almost indistinguishable from conventional atherosclerotic plaque. These temporal changes in histologic pattern provide a pathologic background for clinical reports that restenosis is predominantly found within 6 months after coronary angioplasty. Morphometric analysis revealed that the extent of intimal proliferation was significantly greater in lesions with evidence of medial or adventitial tears than in lesions with no or only intimal tears.\r"

Tissue was obtained from coronary arteries without prior instrumentation (primary lesions, n = 31), aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass grafts with primary lesions (n = 8), coronary arteries with lesions developing after prior balloon angioplasty or mechanical atherectomy (restenotic lesions, n = 30) and vein bypass grafts with restenotic lesions (n = 4). Primary lesions were characterized by dense intimal fibrosis with necrotic debris (83% of intimal tissue) and foam cells typical of atherosclerosis. These lesions frequently contained cholesterol crystals (45% of coronary arteries, 50% of vein grafts) and calcium deposits (65% of coronary arteries, 38% of vein grafts). Restenotic lesions were characterized by an increased proportion of loose fibroproliferative tissue (45% of coronary artery intima, 35% of vein graft intima). Immunohistochemical stains confirmed this proliferative tissue to be primarily smooth muscle cells. Thrombus was rarely observed. Comparison of resected tissues indicated that dense fibrosis and necrosis are significantly more common in primary than in restenotic lesions (83% versus 56% of intimal tissue, p = 0.0005), whereas smooth muscle cell hyperplasia is more common in restenotic than in primary lesions (44% versus 17% of intimal tissue, p less than 0.0005). Partial-thickness resection of medial tissue or full-thickness resection of media with associated adventitial tissue occurred in 27 (56%) of 39 primary atheromatous lesions and 16 (47%) of 34 restenotic lesions; subintimal tissue obtained from primary lesions appeared identical to that obtained from restenotic lesions. These data indicate that the histopathologic characteristics of the neointimal layer of restenotic lesions differ from those of the intimal layer of primary atherosclerotic lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten patients who died or underwent retransplantation within 2 months of coronary angiography had direct correlation of angiographic (normal discrete lesions, diffuse concentric narrowing) with histologic appearance of coronary arteries. Of the 26 angiographically normal segments, 73% showed mild to moderate fibrous intimal thickening by light microscopy. The remainder had intermediate lesions or atheromatous plaques. Discrete stenoses usually corresponded to lipid-rich intermediate or atheromatous disease. In contrast, angiographically diffuse, concentrically narrowed lesions usually were areas of severe fibrous intimal thickening. Fresh or organizing thrombus was most often associated with discrete lesions and accounted for all complete occlusions. Histologic and angiographic comparisons of the degree of luminal narrowing showed generally good correlation for high grade stenoses. Lesions graded as having less than 25% diameter narrowing were often underestimated angiographically as compared with histologic determinations. Transplant coronary artery disease has a heterogeneous histologic and angiographic appearance, with angiographic underestimation of disease in some patients.\r"

The mean age at repair was 8.1 +/- 2.1 years; age at the time of study ranged from 15 to 37 years (mean follow-up time after repair 18 +/- 5 years). Exercise duration was 92 +/- 17% of predicted. Maximal heart rate was 94 +/- 7% of predicted. No exercise test was stopped because of an arrhythmia. Thirty patients had oxygen consumption and ventilation measured during their final minute of exercise. Peak oxygen consumption was 31 +/- 8 ml/kg per min (86 +/- 18% of predicted). Twenty-five patients (45%) had low vital capacity at rest (less than 80% of predicted). Pulmonary regurgitation was identified in 42 (75%) of the patients and judged to be moderate in 10 (18%). Mild tricuspid valve regurgitation was identified in 64%. Doppler estimated right ventricular outflow gradient was greater than 15 mm Hg in 15% of the patients (mean gradient 24 mm Hg [range 16 to 56]). Age at repair, duration of follow-up and type of repair did not correlate with echocardiographic variables, ventilatory data, exercise performance or arrhythmias. Moderate pulmonary regurgitation was associated with increased right ventricular diastolic area and both were inversely related to exercise duration and vital capacity. Decreased breathing reserve during maximal exercise was associated with moderate pulmonary regurgitation and decreased vital capacity. The results indicate that exercise capacity in these patients is in general good; however, right ventricular volume loading and ventilatory dysfunction may produce exercise limitation.\r"

The predictive accuracy of heart period variability may be reduced by drugs used to treat patients after myocardial infarction. Accordingly, a randomized, three period, placebo-controlled, crossover (Latin square) design was used to determine the effect of atenolol and diltiazem on time and frequency measures of heart period variability calculated from 24 h continuous electrocardiographic recordings during treatment with atenolol, diltiazem and placebo in 18 normal volunteers. During atenolol treatment, the 24 h average normal RR (NN) interval increased 24% (p less than 0.001). The three measures of tonic vagal activity were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) during atenolol treatment: percent of successive normal RR intervals greater than 50 ms = 69%, root mean square successive difference of normal RR intervals = 61% and high frequency power in the heart period power spectrum = 84%. Low frequency power also increased 45% (p less than 0.01), indicating that this variable also is an indicator of tonic vagal activity over 24 h. Diltiazem had no significant effect on the 24 h average NN interval or on any measure of heart period variability. The decreased mortality rate after myocardial infarction associated with beta-adrenergic blocker but not calcium channel blocker therapy may be attributed in part to an increase in vagal tone caused by beta-blockers.\r"

All procedures were performed from a femoral approach (92%), brachial approach (6%) or transseptal approach (2%) and utilized either a single balloon technique (72%) or a double balloon technique (28%). Valvuloplasty resulted in a significant improvement in aortic valve area (0.50 +/- 0.18 cm2 to 0.82 +/- 0.30 cm2), mean aortic valve gradient (60 +/- 23 mm Hg to 30 +/- 13 mm Hg) and cardiac output (3.86 +/- 1.26 to 4.05 +/- 1.31 liters/min). Serial aortography demonstrated a moderate or severe increase in aortic insufficiency in only 2.1% of patients. Statistical analysis of the procedural factors affecting acute valvuloplasty results demonstrated significant correlations of single versus double balloon technique, total number of balloon inflations and total number of balloon exchanges with respect to the absolute change in mean aortic valve gradient occurring during the valvuloplasty procedure. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the maximal time of valvuloplasty balloon inflation with aortic valve area measured after valvuloplasty, and there were significant correlations of the total number of balloon inflations and total number of balloon exchanges with the aortic valve mean gradient measured after valvuloplasty. The overall complication rate for the procedure was 20.5%, including vascular injury in 11%, embolic phenomenon in 2.2%, ventricular perforation resulting in tamponade in 1.8%, massive aortic insufficiency in 1%, nonfatal arrhythmia in 0.8% and myocardial infarction in 0.2%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was no gender predilection and the average age at diagnosis was 41 years. Liver cirrhosis was the most frequent cause of hypertension (82%) and a surgical portosystemic shunt was present in 29%. Almost invariably, portal hypertension either preceded or was diagnosed concurrently with pulmonary hypertension, favoring the hypothesis that in portal hypertension, the pulmonary vasculature may be exposed to vasoactive substances normally metabolized or produced by the diseased liver, possibly inducing vasoconstriction or direct toxic damage to the pulmonary arteries. Clinically, exertional dyspnea was the most frequent presenting symptom (81%); other symptoms, such as syncope, chest pain and fatigue, were present in less than 33%. An accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound (82%) and a systolic murmur (69%) were the most common physical findings. At least 75% of these patients had evidence of pulmonary hypertension on electrocardiography (right ventricular hypertrophy) or roentgenography (cardiomegaly or dilated main pulmonary arteries, or both). Hemodynamic findings included severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure 59 +/- 19 mm Hg) with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output. Treatment was basically palliative and the mean and median survival times were 15 and 6 months, respectively. In brief, on the basis of clinical presentation and laboratory features, patients with combined primary pulmonary hypertension and portal hypertension seldom represent a diagnostic challenge. Further research is needed on treatment, which remains palliative. The survival rate is poor and worse than that seen in isolated primary pulmonary hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Stable atrial flutter induced in both conscious and open chest states was studied in 30 mongrel dogs after production of sterile pericarditis. During the conscious state studies, induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 128 +/- 15 ms) was always sustained greater than 15 min and was stable. Three types of flutter wave polarity were noted in electrocardiogram (ECG) lead II: positive in 16 dogs, negative in 3 and flat or slightly positive in 11. Sequential site atrial mapping during atrial flutter (mean cycle length 133 +/- 18 ms) in the open chest state showed either clockwise (18 dogs) or counterclockwise (12 dogs) circus movement in the right atrium. In 19 of 30 dogs, the circus movement clearly did not require any naturally existing anatomic obstacle; in 11, the orifice of the superior vena cava probably was also involved. Double potentials were recorded from the center of the reentrant circuit during atrial flutter, and fractionated electrograms were recorded from a pivot point of the reentrant wave front. A positive flutter wave in ECG lead II (12 dogs with counterclockwise circus movement) was associated with early activation of the Bachmann's bundle region compared with the posteroinferior left atrium and activation of the left atrium mainly in a superoinferior direction. A negative flutter was associated with the early activation of the posteroinferior left atrium compared with Bachmann's bundle and activation of a considerable portion of the left atrium in an inferosuperior direction. A flat or slightly positive flutter wave (14 of 18 with clockwise circus movement) was associated with activation of the left atrium almost simultaneously by two wave fronts coming from both these sites. In conclusion, atrial flutter in this dog model is due to circus movement in the right atrium, the center of which does not necessarily require an anatomic obstacle. Although atrial flutter is generated by circus movement in the right atrium, the flutter wave polarity in the ECG is determined primarily by the activation sequence of the left atrium.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the relations among hypertrophy, fibrosis and diastolic performance in early experimental hypertension, 18 control dogs and 12 dogs with experimental left ventricular hypertrophy were studied. Diastolic function was impaired in dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy, with decreased Doppler early to atrial inflow velocity ratio (E/A) (1.35 versus 1.72), increased atrial filling fraction (35% versus 29%), decreased sonomicrometric peak rates of wall thinning (-2.01 versus -3.37 liters/s) and filling (4.33 versus 6.64 liters/s) and prolonged time constant of isovolumetric relaxation (tau; 34.3 versus 28.1 ms). Neither chamber stiffness (k; P = AekV) nor passive elastic stiffness (E; E = k sigma, where sigma = stress) was increased. At postmortem examination, the hypertensive left ventricle weighed significantly more than normal (116 versus 80 g; p less than 0.01) and had greater muscle fiber diameter at endocardial and epicardial sampling sites in the apical free wall, basal free wall and septum (mean diameter 50 +/- 8 microns in hypertensive dogs, 37 +/- 8 microns in normal dogs; p less than 0.01). In contrast, neither percent fibrosis (1.2 +/- 0.8 versus 0.9 +/- 0.6 in normal dogs) nor fibrotic volume (1.21 +/- 0.63 versus 0.72 +/- 0.42%/g in normal dogs) was significantly increased. Peak volumetric filling rate was inversely related to fiber diameter (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001), although no variable of left ventricular function was significantly related to percent or volume fibrosis (all r less than 0.60, all p greater than 0.05). Thus, diastolic dysfunction may exist in the setting of hypertrophy without significant fibrosis. Increased myocyte size was associated with early diastolic filling abnormalities characteristic of the hypertensive left ventricle. Fibrosis appears to be a less important determinant of diastolic performance.\r"

Forty-one adult patients with the clinical diagnosis of atrial septal defect were studied by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (30 women, 11 men; 18 to 81 years of age). Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated the atrial septal defect in 33 patients (secundum type in 28, primum type in 3 and sinus venosus type in 2). Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated the defect in all 41 patients. Thus, in 8 (20%) of 41 patients the atrial septal defect was demonstrated by transesophageal and not by transthoracic echocardiography. Six of the eight had a sinus venosus type atrial septal defect; the other two patients had a secundum atrial septal defect (one of these two had a technically poor transthoracic echocardiogram and the other had a small atrial septal defect). Transthoracic echocardiography, therefore, failed to demonstrate the sinus venosus defect in six (75%) of eight patients. An anomalous venous connection associated with the sinus venosus defect was visualized by transesophageal echocardiography in seven of the eight patients but was not seen on transthoracic echocardiography in any patient. Sinus venosus type atrial septal defects are frequently not visualized in adults by conventional transthoracic echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography is recommended when an atrial septal defect is clinically suspected but cannot be visualized by transthoracic echocardiography.\r"

All 12 cultures were incubated at 75% relative humidity, 25 degrees C, and observed during 8 weeks. Live mites were then counted under a stereoscope, cultures were extracted, and supernatants were analyzed for Der p I and Der f I allergen content with a two-site monoclonal RIA. Live mite counts in untreated cultures varied from 146 to 274 (215 +/- 47.1), and in caffeine-treated cultures from 0 to 3 (1 +/- 1.2; p less than or equal to 0.0001).

  ".W": "Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to various stimuli is one of the major clinical features of bronchial asthma. In this study, the effect of a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist, AA-2414, on BHR to methacholine was evaluated in 15 patients with asthma. The methacholine inhalation test was performed before and after oral administration of AA-2414 for 4 days (20 or 40 mg/day). The provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was measured as an index of BHR. There was a significant increase in PC20 (p less than 0.01) from 0.43 (geometric SEM, 1.42) mg/ml to 0.93 (geometric SEM, 1.43) mg/ml after 40 mg/day of AA-2414, whereas baseline values of FVC and FEV1 were not changed by the treatment. Twenty milligrams per day of AA-2414 did not alter the PC20 value nor the parameter of baseline pulmonary functions. These findings might support our hypothesis that the subthreshold concentration of TXA2 in the bronchial tissues, which has no effect on bronchomotor tone per se, may be involved in BHR in asthma. Further studies with more potent and specific TXA2 receptor antagonists are needed to confirm the conclusion.\r"

Granulocytes were stimulated with serum-opsonized Sephadex particles, and the released amount of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil protein X (EPX), and myeloperoxidase was measured by means of specific radioimmunoassays. Eosinophils from patients with asthma released significantly more (p less than 0.001) ECP and EPX after 20 minutes of incubation than cells from control subjects without asthma. The release of myeloperoxidase from neutrophils was also somewhat higher (p less than 0.03). The serum concentrations of ECP and EPX were also significantly increased (p less than 0.001) in the group with asthma. No significant relationships were found between clinical variables and the secretory activity of either eosinophils or neutrophils. We conclude that eosinophils and, to some extent, neutrophils from subjects with asthma have an increased propensity to release their granule proteins, which we suggest is a consequence of priming of these cells.\r"

Their anaphylactic symptoms were all clearly distinguished from cholinergic urticaria by history. Patients who developed anaphylactic symptoms before 20 years of age (N = 7) were atopic themselves or had atopic first-degree relatives. Six patients had increased serum IgE levels, and IgE antibodies against the causative food allergens were detected by the skin prick test or RAST in four cases. In contrast, patients who developed the symptoms after 30 years of age (N = 4) appeared to have a less atopic background, and IgE levels were within normal range except in one case. Three of four patients in the latter group developed symptoms after ingesting food made of wheat followed by exercise. All patients were sensitive to wheat as determined by the skin prick test. In six of 11 patients, a considerable rise in plasma histamine concentration was observed after exercise challenge with treadmill alone, and food intake followed by exercise induced a further increase in one patient.\r"

Der p I and Der f I were determined by a sandwich-type ELISA with monoclonal noncross-reacting antibodies to Der p I and polyclonal monospecific antibodies to Der f I. There was a significant reduction of mite allergens in mattresses and carpets within both bb-treated and control groups, but only the results on carpets of the bb-treated group were significantly different from results of the control group on days 30 and 60 (p less than 0.05).\r"

The study population included cohorts exposed to F in the workplace, smokers, and normal subjects. IgE antibody specific for F-HSA was detected by ELISA in three subjects; immediate-type skin testing was negative in two of these subjects, and not interpretable because of dermatographism in one subject. One of these subjects had a history of respiratory symptoms when the subject was working in a histology laboratory that contained ambient F and xylene; a respiratory challenge with F at concentrations of up to 2 ppm failed to produce respiratory symptoms or significant changes in pulmonary function. Serum from the three subjects with IgE to F-HSA by ELISA failed to passively transfer skin reactivity to F-HSA to rhesus monkey recipients. These three subjects and two other subjects had IgG to F-HSA by ELISA, although this was of generally low titer. We could not define a relationship between the presence of antibodies and (1) a history of F exposure or (2) a history of adverse respiratory or conjunctival symptoms from F. This study is a continuum of 5 years of study in our laboratory attempting to define allergy to gaseous F, and the current study does not support an immunologic basis for respiratory or conjunctival symptoms from gaseous F exposure. Based on the findings of this and our other studies, it is possible that clinical IgE-mediated allergy to gaseous F does not exist, or if it does exist, it is extremely rare.\r"

  ".U": "91123605\r", 
  ".W": "Because glucocorticoids are a mainstay in the treatment of asthma and other allergic diseases, we tested the effect of various steroid hormones on secretory IgA- and IgG-induced eosinophil degranulation in vitro. Human normodense eosinophils were purified by discontinuous Percoll density gradient, and hypodense eosinophils were obtained by culture of normodense cells with recombinant human interleukin (rIL)-5. Eosinophils were incubated with various steroids, including dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, estradiol, or dihydrotestosterone at concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-4) mol/L. Sepharose 4B beads coupled to ovalbumin, secretory IgA, or IgG were added as targets of degranulation and incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 hours. In some experiments, rIL-5 was added to eosinophils before addition of beads to activate the cells. The release of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin was measured by radioimmunoassay as an index of degranulation. Dexamethasone (10(-9) to 10(-4) mol/L), hydrocortisone (10(-9) to 10(-4) mol/L), estradiol (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L), and dihydrotestosterone (10(-9) to 10(-4) mol/L) had no effect on normodense eosinophil degranulation. Methylprednisolone, 10(-5) mol/L, inhibited degranulation of normodense eosinophils up to 20%, whereas 10(-4) mol/L inhibited degranulation of hypodense eosinophils, up to 30%. Overall, no difference in inhibition by steroids was observed between normodense and hypodense eosinophils. rIL-5 enhanced immunoglobulin-induced eosinophil degranulation, but this effect of rIL-5 was not blocked by any of the steroids tested. These results suggest that eosinophil degranulation and rIL-5-mediated eosinophil activation are not direct targets of glucocorticoids and that the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids on allergic inflammation in vivo are not likely due to direct effects on eosinophil degranulation.\r"

Skin tests (STs) with penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL), penicillin minor determinant mixture, and antipseudomonal BLA were positive in 19 patients (90%). The BLA causing the most recent allergic reaction, minor determinant mixture, or PPL, was positive in 89%, 53%, and 32% of ST-positive patients, respectively. Serum PPL-specific IgE antibodies were not detectable, although PPL-specific IgG antibodies were found in 64% of patients tested. STs to aztreonam reagents were performed and were initially negative in 20 patients. One patient was ST positive to the polylysine conjugate of hydrolyzed aztreonam (SQ 27629), despite no prior exposure to aztreonam, and was not treated. Of 20 patients treated with aztreonam, four were demonstrated to be sensitized by exposure (one had an SR during initial treatment course, two had SRs on reexposure, and one patient was asymptomatic after intravenous desensitization) by positive aztreonam reagent skin responses on repeat testing. Aztreonyl-specific IgE and IgG serum antibodies were not detected in any patients, including patients with allergic reactions to aztreonam. Thus, aztreonam is generally well tolerated in high-risk patients with CF allergic to other BLAs and appears to have reduced immunogenicity by serologic testing. However, caution should be exercised with aztreonam in BLA-allergic patients with CF in light of 5% preexisting ST cross-reactivity and 20% sensitization rates found in this study.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that neural transmitters, including neuropeptides, may modulate the release of mast cell mediators. Because neuropeptide Y (NPY) has recently been recognized as a putative cotransmitter in noradrenergic neurons, we studied the effect of NPY on purified rat peritoneal mast cells. NPY induced mast cell degranulation, as assessed by a dose-dependent increase in net release of beta-hexosaminidase. The concentration that produced 50% of the maximal effect, approximately 10 mumol/L, evoked a 40% +/- 3% release. As previously reported for other neuropeptides, release was fast with maximal release already achieved at 60 seconds. Release was at 4 degrees C. In contrast to its effects on mast cell degranulation, NPY had no effect on the generation of prostaglandin D2, the major mast cell cyclooxygenase product. By comparison, the calcium ionophore A23187, at doses (4 mumol/L) that evoked comparable release of beta-hexosaminidase, stimulated a net release of 37 +/- 9 ng of PGD2 per 10(6) mast cells. These results raise the possibility that NPY may act as a modulator between the autonomic nervous system and mast cells. The results also imply that with neuropeptide stimulation, the release of preformed and newly formed mast cell mediators are mediated through independent pathways.\r"

Skin testing for leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and histamine was performed at three different time intervals after receiving ICI 204,219 or placebo. The LTD4 threshold dose responses were recorded in duplicate to verify reproducibility. These data confirm known remarkable dose-response variation of cutaneous vascular reactions to LTD4 since some subjects reacted to a dose as low as 0.001 fmol. Twelve subjects (67%) demonstrated a more than one-half log increase in their threshold response after receiving ICI 204,219. Five of these 12 subjects (28%) had greater than 1 log-dose response after ICI 204,219. Two of these subjects (11.1%) had a 5 or 10 log increase in their threshold response after receiving ICI 204,219. Given the role of leukotrienes as potentially important mediators in immediate-type reactions, our results raise the possibility for additional investigation of the antagonistic effect of ICI 204,219 in nonallergic and allergic cutaneous diseases.\r"

An incidental sample of 241 respondents was drawn from four grocery stores of a local chain in Utah. Data were collected using a computerized interviewing system. The results suggested that consumers with higher education levels had a better understanding of diet-disease-related messages and a more positive attitude toward health messages on food labels. Knowledge of fiber was significantly correlated with positive attitudes toward health messages and understanding of health messages. Overall, attitudes toward placing diet-disease-related messages on food labels were positive. On a scale of 1 through 250, the mean score was 182.5 +/- 37.5 standard deviation (73%). Consumer knowledge of fiber was low. Out of 15 possible points, the mean score for fiber knowledge questions was 8.8 +/- 2.1 (59%). Consumers were more familiar with the role fiber may play in the prevention or treatment of certain diseases or conditions than with sources, classifications, and recommended intakes of fiber. Understanding of health messages was relatively low (45%). Whereas consumer attitudes toward health messages on food labels were positive, consumers (especially less-educated consumers) did not appear to understand the messages well. These results reiterate the concern for public policymakers to exercise caution and ensure that health messages on food labels are responsible and accurate. The results should also remind dietetic practitioners, who are the nutrition experts, of their continual role in providing and ensuring accurate nutrition education to the public.\r"

  ".W": "Contributions of specific foods and supplements to absolute intake and between-person variance in consumption of 19 macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals were examined using dietary records of all foods consumed over 4 weeks by 194 US nurses aged 34 to 59 years. To measure their contribution to absolute nutrient intake, we ranked foods by the percentage of the population's total nutrient intake that they provided. To assess the degree to which differences in consumption of specific foods explain between-person variability in nutrient intake, we re-ranked the 20 foods contributing most to absolute intake of each nutrient as independent variables in stepwise multiple regression analyses predicting total intake of that nutrient. The increase in percentage of the variance in nutrient intake explained by the addition of a food to the progressively larger list of food items (expressed as the cumulative R2) served as the measure of contribution to variation in intake. Some nutrients had only a few major sources and were assessed relatively well by a small number of foods. For preformed vitamin A without supplements, 10 foods accounted for 82% of the absolute intake and 98% of total variance. The corresponding percentages for absolute intake and total variance, respectively, were 66% and 94% for beta-carotene; 77% and 92% for cholesterol; and 71% and 95% for vitamin C without supplements. In contrast, 20 foods accounted for only 54% of the absolute intake and 73% of the variance for total energy intake; 58% and 89%, respectively, for total carbohydrates; and 59% and 84%, respectively, for potassium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On-site preparation was limited to rethermalization of frozen entrees and portioning of bulk-delivered items. Time spent was assigned or allocated to either congregate or home-delivered meal service on the basis of number of meals served. Time in each component of direct work, indirect work, and delay was divided by meals served to provide the productivity ratio, labor minutes per meal. Comparisons were also made on the basis of number of meals served. An average of 12.78 minutes per meal was used to serve congregate meals and 21.05 minutes per meal for home-delivered meals. Two of the eight centers differed significantly in time used for direct work and total work to serve congregate-meal participants. There was no difference between centers in time used to serve homebound clients. The number of meals served did not influence productivity for either meal service site. These findings establish baseline data for the amount of time needed in one production system to serve meals to center participants and homebound clients. Managers of senior centers can use information about this food production and delivery system to make decisions about the most cost-effective method to provide meals.\r"

  ".W": "In early spring of 1988, questionnaires were mailed to 4,000 Midwestern physicians to survey their attitudes and practices regarding elevated serum cholesterol and their use of referrals for nutrition counseling; 633 physicians responded. Sixty-eight percent of the physicians thought that reducing high serum cholesterol levels would substantially affect heart disease; however, physicians attributed considerably less preventive value to reducing the cholesterol level than to reducing blood pressure (80.3%) or ceasing smoking (90.0%). The range of serum cholesterol for which diet therapy was most frequently initiated was 5.70 to 6.20 mmol/L. The most frequent range for initiation of drug therapy was 7.80 to 8.25 mmol/L. The physicians reported that although their medical school training did not prepare them adequately for providing diet counseling, they did feel prepared to provide, and were successful in, counseling on diet modifications for reducing serum cholesterol. Few (10%) of the total sample reported having registered dietitians available for dietary counseling, and most (88.8%) believed that it is the physician's responsibility to provide such counseling. Although the low response rate limits the conclusions of the survey, it is likely that those physicians most interested in the topic responded. We conclude that registered dietitians should explore the need for their special services further. More aggressive marketing of dietetic services could benefit both physicians and patients in the campaign to reduce serum cholesterol.\r"

  ".W": "Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), or Type II diabetes, is characterized by two primary defects: insulin resistance and insulin secretion. The two major goals of management of NIDDM are to achieve near normal metabolic control and to prevent/delay the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Nutrition, exercise, and, if necessary, medication are the three primary treatment modalities used in NIDDM. Treatment regimens need to be individualized and developed with consideration for diabetes management goals and quality-of-life issues. Lean individuals with NIDDM should be encouraged to maintain their body weight and modify food composition and eating pattern to minimize glucose excursions. The primary treatment goal for an obese individual with NIDDM is weight loss. The process of teaching nutrition and meal planning involves developing a cooperative alliance, gathering information, setting realistic goals, intervention, and maintaining change. Nutrition intervention involves providing information in stages, beginning with \"survival skill\" information and progressing to in-depth information. The dietitian's responsibility is to promote continuity of learning by introducing new ideas and concepts and altering the learning environment. Dietitians can expand their role in the 1990s to that of a diabetes educator taking a leadership role to ensure that the individual with NIDDM receives comprehensive and individualized care.\r"

  ".W": "A parent-child autotutorial dietary education program for 4- to 10-year-old, hypercholesterolemic children and their families was developed and pilot tested. The 10-lesson program, designed for weekly use at home, uses a \"talking-book\" approach (audiotapes with accompanying picture booklet) for the child. Parents are provided with information on ways to make recommended dietary changes, along with hands-on activities to do with the children. To help match the instructional approach to the wide developmental range within the children's age span, materials are divided into three program levels that use different story characters and concept presentations. During program development, evaluation by two children (and their parents) for each of the program levels guided the design and refinement of the lessons. A pilot test among 22 hypercholesterolemic children (whose treatment was limited to diet modification) revealed that children within the 4- to 10-year age range liked the \"talking-book\" approach and identified positively with the story characters. Parents indicated that their materials were clear and helpful. Between the baseline and 3-month follow-up visits, the children exhibited a significant increase in knowledge of heart healthy foods, a decrease in total fat consumption that approached significance, and a significant decrease in plasma low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol values.\r"

This study examined the relationship between keeping food records and subsequent weight loss in a large-scale, conservative weight loss program. Keeping food records was a better predictor of weight loss than were baseline body mass index, exercise, and age. Monthly as well as cumulative weight loss was directly related to the number of days in which food records were kept. The strong, linear relationship between food record patterns and weight loss suggests that in spite of legitimate concern about the accuracy and representativeness of self-reported food records, they have considerable power as a predictor of success in achieving weight loss.\r"

However, it is believed that this model does not accurately define many illness presentations in elderly patients. The frequency with which the medical model is diagnostically accurate, and the other models that might more effectively diagnose geriatric illness, are unknown. This study was designed to ascertain the frequency with which the medical model of diagnosis pertains in a clinical population of older adults and to develop and validate alternative models for diagnosis of illness presentation in this population. Using a retrospective chart review (n = 86) and a prospective validation in a second sample (n = 56) of geriatric assessment clinic patients, it was found that the medical model of illness fit less than half of the patients. To describe the illness presentations of the remaining patients, four new diagnostic models of illness presentation were identified which incorporate comorbidity, functional, and psychosocial factors. Use of these new models along with the medical model of illness diagnosis may assist in more accurate and complete diagnosis in elderly patients and enhance teaching of effective diagnosis in geriatric medicine.\r"

Twenty-two subjects over 65 years old with serum creatinine less than 180 mumols/L and confined indoors for more than 6 months were chosen from the community and a nursing home in Southeast Baltimore. Three-day food records were obtained along with serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2 D), and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH). The mean daily vitamin D intake was over twofold greater than the adult Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of 200 IU. The mean 25-OHD level was 40 nmol/L (normal 25-138 nmol/L) with seven patients less than 25 nmol/L. Of these participants with 25-OHD values less than 25 nmol/L, the mean vitamin D intake was 467 IU (range 36-1096 IU). We conclude that the current RDA seems inadequate for many older individuals who do not get sun exposure. This particular population of elderly is at risk to develop vitamin D deficiency and the associated complications.\r"

These data suggest that the timed \"Up & Go\" test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time. The test is quick, requires no special equipment or training, and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination.\r"

In order to more clearly define these relationships, a prospective longitudinal study was devised to answer two questions: (1) whether race or level of education affects scores on the Mini-Mental State (MMS) exam in non-demented people and (2) what numerical cutpoints maximize the sensitivity and specificity of utilizing the MMS to help diagnose dementia in blacks of varying educational attainment. A total of 100 white and 258 black individuals, recruited from two city hospital primary care geriatric clinics, were evaluated and subsequently followed longitudinally over a 2 1/2 year period in order to assess accurately the presence or absence of dementia. In the non-demented, total MMS scores and performance on each item of the MMS were analyzed, revealing that people with an 8th grade or less education consistently had significantly (P less than .01) worse results than the better educated (9th grade or better) on borough, attention items, recall of table and dog, copying, sentence writing, phrase repeating, and total score. Furthermore, a total of 25% of the lower education group had an MMS score in the 18-23 range, traditionally thought to suggest dementia. There were no consistently significant differences between blacks and whites of equal education. In the better educated groups, using a score of 23 or less to define dementia maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of using the MMS in this diagnosis at 93% and 100%, respectively. In the lower education group, using 17 or less to define dementia maximizes sensitivity and specificity at 81% and 100%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was undertaken to assess physician practices with regard to the diagnosis of dementing disorders. Data from 53 physicians (a response rate of 48%) in several specialties were obtained from a self-administered mail questionnaire. Results indicate that the majority of physicians provided history taking, physical examination, and neurological examination. Physicians were more likely to refer patients for psychiatric and neuropsychological examinations than to provide these services themselves. The results also point to deficiencies in two key areas: the use of formal, published diagnostic criteria, and the use of mental status and cognitive function tests. Over 75% of physicians surveyed did not use either DSM-III or NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria, and 42% of physicians did not provide any mental status tests themselves. The need for continuing education to close knowledge gaps is emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "Identifying patients who will need long-term care may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of acute hospital care. This prospective study evaluated clinicians' ability to identify patients requiring nursing home care. The study had two principal objectives. The first objective was to measure whether registered nurses, physicians, and social workers made similar estimates of the probability of nursing home placement early in an acute care hospitalization. The second objective was to identify the clinical characteristics of patients for whom the clinicians incorrectly predicted that they would return home. The study subjects were 342 patients older than age 55 who were admitted to the medicine, surgery, and neurology services of two university-affiliated Veterans Affairs hospitals. Fifteen percent were discharged to nursing homes. The nurses, physicians, and social workers had high agreement in their estimates of the probability of nursing home placement for each patient. However, each of the provider groups assigned low probability estimates to more than 20% of the patients discharged to nursing homes. Examination of the characteristics of patients assigned low probability estimates revealed that mental impairment and functional disability were higher in those patients who ultimately were discharged to nursing homes than in those patients who returned to their homes. These findings suggest that better assessment and interpretation of patient characteristics early in the hospital stay may improve discharge planning. Some clinicians appear to underestimate mental and functional impairment as risk factors for long-term care needs.\r"

In addition, the effect of the temperature of a meal on postprandial BP is unknown. However, it has been suggested that vasoactive gastrointestinal peptides are involved in the etiology of postprandial BP reduction. Therefore, we studied the effects of a cold and a warm glucose solution on BP, heart rate, plasma glucose, insulin, and substance-P levels in 15 healthy elderly subjects with a mean age of 74 +/- 3 (SD) years. With an interval of at least 2 days, a warm (50 degrees C) and a cold (5 degrees C) solution (75 g glucose/300 mL water) were given in random order. After the cold glucose loading mean arterial pressure increased by a maximum of 3.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg (P less than 0.01). In contrast, BP decreased after the warm solution by a maximum of 8.0 +/- 1.1 mmHg (P less than 0.001). Neither test had an influence on plasma substance-P levels. Our data suggest that postprandial blood pressure reduction in the elderly is dependent on food temperature. Substance-P does not seem to play a role in this phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "The age of onset of the post-poliomyelitis syndrome (PPS) coincides with the tendency for declining activity of the growth hormone/somatomedin C (GH/SmC) axis. The normal plasma SmC range in men before the age of 40 is 0.50 to 1.50 units/mL. After age 40 about 30% of men have a plasma SmC level below 0.35 units/mL, signifying no detectable spontaneous GH secretory pulses. Because the GH/SmC axis stimulates DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in muscle cells and increases their size and number, a deficiency of the GH/SmC axis could theoretically contribute as a secondary factor to the occurrence or severity of the PPS. Accordingly, the authors measured the plasma SmC level in 10 men with PPS, ages 35 to 63, and in 94 healthy men of similar age. In the PPS men, 100% of the values were less than or equal to 0.40 units/mL, and 90% were less than or equal to 0.35 units/mL. The corresponding proportions in the healthy men were 40% and 27%. Analysis of variance including age as a factor showed SmC to be significantly lower in the PPS men than in the healthy men. In an additional comparison, totally immobile nursing home men did not have lowered SmC values. In fact their SmC values were slightly higher than those of healthy men of similar age. The data revealed a new biochemical feature of PPS, hyposomatomedinemia, which might play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome.\r"

Calcium carbonate (1.2 grams elemental calcium/day) or placebo was administered for 6 months to a group of 42 healthy, ambulatory men and women with a mean age of 71. Fasting blood samples and 2-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and at 1 and 6 months. The decline in serum PTH levels from baseline in the calcium-supplemented group was significant in comparison with the placebo group changes (for the calcium group: 40.9 pg/mL at baseline to 34.0 pg/mL at 1 month and 33.2 at 6 months). This drop in PTH was associated with a decline in 1,25 OH-Vitamin D levels from a mean of 38.3 pg/mL to 30.4 pg/mL at 1 month and 31.9 at 6 months. During calcium supplementation, no changes were observed in serum bone Gla protein values. A decline in urinary hydroxyproline excretion was observed at 6 months, but this did not reach significant levels. The present study demonstrates suppression of PTH levels with calcium supplementation, an effect which lasts at least 6 months. This change was accompanied by a decrease in serum 1,25 OH-Vitamin D. The lack of significant changes in either serum bone gla protein or urine hydroxyproline excretion fails to support any significant change in bone turnover occurring with this decrease in PTH.\r"

Due partly to the lack of operational definitions and the absence of information on reliability, no consensus on classification has been reached. Consequently, in a 3-year prospective study of falls occurring in a probability sample of community-dwelling elderly (n = 1,358), a fall classification system was developed and tested for interrater reliability. The 366 falls in the first year of the study were independently classified by two reviewers on the basis of a narrative description and structured interview. The falls in the four major categories of the classification system included: falls related to extrinsic factors (55%), falls related to intrinsic factors (39%), falls from a non-bipedal stance (8%) and unclassified falls (7%). The interrater reliability for the four major categories was 89.9% with a kappa of 0.828. The system provides operational definitions for types of falls and a reliable and flexible method for classifying falls in the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the well known interrelationship between the CD2- and CD3-mediated signal transduction pathways, it is not well established whether the CD2 surface expression can be regulated by triggering of TCR/CD3 complex. In this study we show that the stimulation of human PBMC with the Cris-7 (CD3) mAb, both in soluble and particulate form, results in hyperexpression of the CD2 surface Ag, as assessed by immunofluorescence and semi-quantitative immunoprecipitation assays. Similar effects on CD2 surface expression were obtained when different CD3 mAb (OKT3, RW2-8C8 and Leu-4) were tested. The CD3-mediated CD2 up-regulation was suppressed by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, indicating that it requires de novo protein and RNA synthesis. In agreement with this, increased CD2 RNA levels were observed after 3 h of stimulation, reaching a plateau at 24 h that was maintained for 72 h. The CD2 up-regulation was concomitant to other CD3-induced activation-related events such as induction of surface CD25 and CD71 and high RNA levels for c-myc, IL-2R alpha- and beta-chains, CD71, and IFN-gamma. CD2 up-regulation appeared to be elicited by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism because it was abrogated by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor. Moreover, IL-2-dependent events may also help in enhancing CD2 hyper-expression because it was only partially inhibitable by cyclosporine, dexamethasone, or Mar-108 (CD25) mAb. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD2 up-regulation can be a relevant event in T cell activation triggered by the physiologic engagement of the TCR/CD3 complex.\r"

To further address the role of PKC in T cell activation, the effects of high level expression of the PKC-gamma isoenzyme in murine CTL clones were examined. Unlike the parental cells that required periodic Ag stimulation for cell activation and growth, cells expressing a retrovirally transduced PKC-gamma gene propagated in culture independent of the need for Ag stimulation, although maintaining identical functional specificity to the parental CTL. Constitutive PKC-gamma expression may therefore mimic physiologic PKC activation, thereby abrogating the requirement for TCR-Ag interaction in T cell activation.\r"

Thus lymphoid cells derived from the injected mice were greatly reduced in their ability to proliferate and to produce IL-2 in response to (C57BL/6XDBA/2)F1 stimulator cells in vitro, whereas third party responses were unaffected. This appears to be due to a reduction in the precursor frequency of IL-2-producing T lymphocytes specific for the injected cells as measured by limiting dilution analysis. Similar donor-specific reduction in the frequency of precursors of IL-2-producing cells was seen after i.v. injection of A.TL lymphocytes into A.TH recipients (differing at class II determinants I-A and I-E, but identical at K and D). Here there also appeared to be a functional clonal deletion of precursors of IL-2-producing Th cells, shown directly to be class II MHC reactive and CD4+. There is strong evidence that the reduction of class I-specific cytotoxic responses in the injected mice is a manifestation of donor cells that function as veto cells, i.e., that function as deletional APC that inactivate class I-reactive CTL precursors that recognize them. Our data in this study show that class II-specific Th responses are similarly reduced in the injected mice and suggest that CD4+ class II-reactive precursors of Th cells may be functionally inactivated in vivo by donor cells via a veto-like mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Th physically interact with B cells and produce lymphokines that influence B cell growth and differentiation. The respective contribution of cell contact and lymphokines to induction of B cell growth and differentiation was addressed using purified plasma membranes (PM) from resting Th (PMrest) and anti-CD3-activated Th (PMCD3) together with lymphokines. Results show that PMCD3, but not PMrest, induce 10% of resting B cells to enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle, with few B cells entering G1b and S/G2. The inclusion of IL-4, but not IL-2, IL-5, or IFN-gamma, amplifies the B cell response to PMCD3 by increasing the total percentage of activatable B cells to greater than 40% and inducing B cell progression into G1b, S, and G2. Direct comparison between PMrest and PMCD3 purified from Th1 and Th2 indicate that both Th1 and Th2 induce similar levels of B cell proliferation in the presence of IL-4. Further, the lymphokine requirements for B cell proliferation induced by PMCD3 from Th1 and Th2 is indistinguishable. B cell differentiation to IgM, IgG1, and IgG2a synthesis by PMCD3 required IL-4 and IL-5. Using lymphokine conditions that supported B cell differentiation, PMCD3 purified from Th1 and Th2 induced similar levels of IgM, and IgG1. Given the functional data on PMCD3 from Th1 and Th2, the data indicate that there are no substantive differences between Th1- and Th2-derived PMCD3, and that the major differences in the ability of viable Th1 and Th2 to activate B cells is the lymphokines produced by the cells.\r"

TCR occupancy alone results in unresponsiveness (anergy) to antigenic stimulation, a phenomenon that may be important for self-tolerance in vivo. Inasmuch as inositol phosphate production occurs during the induction of anergy other biochemical signals must be necessary for IL-2 production. Here we assess the role of tyrosine-specific protein kinases using the specific inhibitor, genistein. IL-2 secretion and responsiveness were very dependent on tyrosine-specific protein kinase activation and could be completely blocked under conditions where inositol phosphate generation occurred normally. Although anergy induction could also be blocked by inhibition of tyrosine-specific protein kinase activation this probably occurred indirectly via inhibition of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. The differential susceptibility of IL-2 secretion and anergy induction to inhibition by genistein indicates that positive and negative outcomes of TCR occupancy may be mediated by distinct biochemical pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that the zeta-subunit of the TCR complex plays a critical role in transducing signals initiated by the Ag receptor heterodimer. Because thymic maturation involves specific interactions between the TCR complex and thymic stromal cells, the zeta-subunit has been postulated to also play a role in this process. To assess the potential for zeta to contribute to thymocyte maturation, we have used an anti-zeta mAb (TIA-2) to quantitate its expression in mature (CD3bright) and immature (CD3dim and CD3-) populations of human thymocytes. Using both flow cytometric and immunoblotting analysis, we found that the relative expression of TCR-zeta varied directly with the surface expression of CD3. Importantly, TCR-zeta was detected in the majority of CD3- thymocytes, indicating that its expression precedes the surface appearance of CD3:TCR. In thymocytes, TCR-zeta was found to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The relative expression of phospho-zeta varied directly with the maturational stage of the thymocyte, with the mature (CD3bright), single positive cells accounting for most of the phospho-zeta found in the human thymus. The expression of phospho-zeta could be significantly increased by activating thymocytes with mAb reactive with either CD3 or CD2. These results suggest that TCR-zeta is functionally linked to the major thymocyte activation receptors.\r"

TGF-beta inhibited lymphocyte attachment to resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells and also to endothelial monolayers stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Our investigations also show that the ability of endothelial cells to respond to TGF-beta by altering their adhesiveness is lost with prolonged culture of the cells. However, this loss is selective as TGF-beta inhibits cell proliferation in both early and late passage endothelial cells. These results suggest that in vivo TGF-beta may inhibit the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells and also may limit the immunologic response occurring at the endothelial cell barrier.\r"

  ".W": "Although the humoral response to human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-I) has been well characterized in patients with HTLV-I-associated neurologic disease (HAM/TSP), little is known about a functional HTLV-I-specific human T cell response, such as CTL, in these patients. To define both the phenotype of the responding CTL and the fine specificity of this response, long term T cell lines were generated from two HAM/TSP patients who were from two different countries. Patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes were repeatedly stimulated in vitro with an HTLV-I expressing autologous T cell line. The resultant long term T cell culture was shown to be CD4+ and cytotoxic for targets expressing HTLV-I Ag. Using a panel of synthetic peptides that span hydrophilic regions of the HTLV-I gp46 envelope glycoprotein, the CTL lines generated from both patients were shown to recognize the same region of the HTLV-I envelope between amino acids 196-209 as defined by the synthetic peptide sp4a1. Interestingly, this sequence overlaps a region of HTLV-I envelope that had also been shown to elicit a strong B cell response in HAM/TSP patients (amino acids 190-203). One CTL line recognized this HTLV-I epitope in the context of HLA DQ5 whereas the other CTL line was restricted by HLA DRw16. The generation of two independent CTL lines from two HAM/TSP patients from different geographic areas that recognize the same region of the HTLV-I envelope glycoprotein highlights the immunogenic nature of this envelope region.\r"

  ".W": "The hamster mAb 145-2C11 specific for the CD3 complex of murine T lymphocytes shares many properties with OKT3, including the induction of T cell activation. In vivo, the injection of 145-2C11 entails a variety of pathologic changes in relation to the systemic release of cytokines. We tested the effects on this cytokine release syndrome of different doses of methylprednisolone (m-PDS) given at various intervals of time before the 145-2C11 mAb. The administration of high doses of m-PDS (50 mg/kg) 2 to 3 h before the mAb resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the systemic release of TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-6. As far as the pathologic changes are concerned, the hypothermia, the acute renal tubular necrosis, and the fatty infiltration of the liver were completely prevented whereas the hypoglycemia was only partially attenuated. The protective effect of m-PDS on the toxicity of 145-2C11 was confirmed by the reduction of the mortality rate among galactosamine-sensitized mice. The inhibition of the release of cytokines by m-PDS did not affect the immunosuppression triggered by 145-2C11 as assessed by the CTL activity against alloantigens measured 48 h after the injection of the mAb. We conclude that the administration of very high doses of glucocorticoids 2 to 3 h before 145-2C11 prevents the release of cytokines and attenuates the acute toxicity of the mAb. Similar protocols could allow mitigation of the cytokine-release syndrome induced by the OKT3 mAb in man.\r"

We examined the effects of a potent anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone (DXS), on the production of this factor. Over a wide range of concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-8) M), DXS inhibited the production of MCAF at the mRNA and protein level in a human fibrosarcoma cell line, which was stimulated with either IL-1 or TNF-alpha. We examined the turn-over of synthesized MCAF mRNA that showed DXS decreased the stability of MCAF mRNA. Furthermore, the addition of actinomycin D and cycloheximide abolished this effect of DXS, indicating that de novo mRNA and protein synthesis were required for this process. In addition, a nuclear run-off analysis revealed that DXS also inhibited the transcription of IL-1- or TNF-activated MCAF genes. Therefore, both the destabilization of MCAF mRNA and the inhibition of transcription of the gene contribute to the decrease in the MCAF mRNA steady state level by DXS.\r"

Although several VH and V kappa genes are used to generate antibodies of this specificity, two combinations account for more than 80% of the repertoire from the spleen: VH11/V kappa 9 and VH12/V kappa 4. Antibodies representing these two predominant groups were found to correspond to two previously reported distinct cross-reactive Id families accounting for most of the anti-BrMRBC reactivity in several strains of mice. mAb of the VH11/V kappa 9 type bound the haptens trimethyl-ammonium and phosphorylcholine much more avidly (approximately 1000 fold) than did the VH12/V kappa 4 type antibodies. Both of these haptens represent constituents of phosphatidylcholine, which BrMRBC-specific antibodies are reported to bind. Despite this differential reactivity, members of both the VH11/V kappa 9 and VH12/V kappa 4 antibody groups lysed BrMRBC with similar efficiencies. These data suggest that the two major classes of BrMRBC-specific antibodies have at least partially different specificities and imply that the events that lead to their high frequencies in the CD5+ repertoire may result from different selective forces.\r"

CRP binding to several substrates, including phosphocholine, individual denatured histones, and chromatin, has been demonstrated. We previously demonstrated that CRP binding to chromatin is dependent on the presence of histone H1, despite the fact that CRP binds to purified individual histones H2A and H2B, as well as to H1. In this report we examined the binding of CRP to native sub-nucleosomal chromatin fragments. CRP binding to the H2A-H2B dimer and (H3-H4)2 tetramer was demonstrated and these reactions were inhibited by phosphocholine. However, no binding to the subnucleosome complexes (H2A-H2B)-DNA and (H3-H4)2-DNA was seen. Similarly, CRP binding to H1 was eliminated when H1 was reconstituted with DNA. The reconstitution of H1-depleted chromatin with H1 restored CRP binding. CRP binding to nucleosome core particles, as previously demonstrated by others, was confirmed. Therefore, the interaction of CRP with individual core histones does not appear to be responsible for the binding of CRP to native chromatin. However, binding to core particles could be mediated by differentially exposed determinants on H2A and H2B.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that in transgenic mice expressing human class I MHC molecules, it is difficult to demonstrate a significant CTL response to a viral Ag in the context of the transgenic molecule. In this paper, a procedure is reported for the isolation of influenza-specific murine CTL restricted by the human class I molecule HLA-A2.1. The principal specificity of such CTL is for a fragment of the influenza M1 protein that has been previously shown to be immunodominant for human HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL. CTL of this specificity were also established through the use of peptide-pulsed rather than virus-infected stimulators. The dependence of murine CTL recognition upon peptide length and HLA-A2 structure was established to be similar to that previously reported for human CTL. However, the fine specificity of CTL maintained on virus-infected stimulators was somewhat different from that of CTL maintained with M1 peptide. This suggests that differences in surface density or peptide structure between peptide-pulsed and virus-infected stimulators may result in the outgrowth of T cells with different receptor structures. The immunodominance of the M1 peptide determinant in both mice and humans suggests that species-specific differences in TCR structure, Ag-processing systems, and self-tolerance are of less importance than limitations on the ability of antigenic peptides to bind to appropriate class I molecules. These results thus establish the utility of the transgenic system for the identification of human class I MHC-restricted T cell epitopes.\r"

  ".U": "91123695\r", 
  ".W": "Studies originally designed to assess the putative role of endogenous C5 in macrophage activation for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) yielded unanticipated results. Resident and inflammatory peritoneal macrophages from C5-deficient AKR mice were found to have significantly lower capacity for FcR-dependent ADCC activation and phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized SRBC targets than did C5-competent C3HeB/FeJ (C3H) mice. Reconstitution of the ADCC response of AKR macrophages was accomplished initially with C5-sufficient C3H mouse serum, which suggested that endogenous C5 may be required for ADCC activation. However, further investigation largely eliminated C5 involvement in that a heat-labile component of C5-deficient AKR serum was shown to be active in the reconstitution of ADCC activation of AKR macrophages. Macrophages from AKR mice were found to have significantly lower levels of C1q mRNA synthesis, endogenous C1q levels, and C1q secretion than did C3H mouse macrophages as determined by Northern blot, Western blot, and presynthetic radiolabeling analysis, respectively. The addition of purified exogenous C1q to IgG-opsonized SRBC targets fully reconstituted ADCC activation for AKR inflammatory peritoneal macrophages to levels of normally FcR-responsive C3H macrophages. Similarly, exogenous C1q augmented FcR-dependent phagocytosis of AKR macrophages but had no effect on macrophages from responsive C3H mice. Our results indicate that AKR mice have a deficiency for FcR-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis that is related to their low potential for C1q synthesis and secretion rather than to their established genetic deficiency for C5 synthesis. We tentatively conclude that endogenous C1q is required as an accessory molecule for macrophage FcR-dependent effector functions and that C5 is not a prerequisite for ADCC activation.\r"

It was found that in most cases, different DR alleles recognize almost identical, albeit distinct, core regions, suggesting that different DR alleles may recognize similar structures on their peptide ligands. Furthermore, it was found that these core regions, notwithstanding their derivation from unrelated sequences, share a common structural pattern. When the sequences of several other unrelated determinants were scrutinized, the structural motif identified was present in some, but absent in other good DR binders, suggesting that good DR binding capacity of peptide molecules may be compatible with more than one single sequence pattern.\r"

The results obtained demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in the expression of type II IgG-binding proteins among and within group A isolates. Extraction and analysis of type II IgG-binding proteins from selected strains demonstrate the existence of five functionally distinct IgG-binding proteins. The type IIo IgG binding protein displayed the greatest range of reactivities, binding to all four human IgG subclasses, and rabbit, pig, and horse IgG. A variant of this protein, designated type II'o, bound all four human subclasses and rabbit IgG, but failed to react with pig or horse IgG. A type IIa protein was recovered from certain group A strains which bound human IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, as well as reacting with rabbit, pig, and horse IgG. A functionally related type IIc activity that displayed all of the reactivities of the type IIa protein but did not bind with human IgG2 was also identified. The final functional form of group A IgG-binding protein, the type IIb protein, bound exclusively to human IgG3. Comparison of these functionally different type II IgG-binding proteins demonstrated no simple structure-function relationship. These studies underscore the heterogeneity of type II Ig-binding proteins expressed by different group A streptococci and document that a single strain can change its pattern of expression of type II IgG-binding protein both quantitatively and qualitatively.\r"

Twelve mAb were selected from a large number of anti-nuclease mAb and characterized for affinity and isotype, by their ability to block enzyme activity, and by complementation and competitive inhibition assays for the relative location of epitopes. The mAb were placed in complementation groups based on their distinct binding patterns. These groups define a series of eight overlapping epitopes that are estimated to cover a large portion of the nuclease surface. Four mAb blocked the enzyme activity of nuclease. The epitopes defined by two of these four mAb were localized on the surface of nuclease using single amino acid variant Ag generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned nuclease coding sequence. mAb-25 maps to residue 46 which is located at the edge of the enzyme active site consistent with its ability to inhibit enzyme activity. mAb-19, which also blocks enzyme activity and belongs to the same complementation group as mAb-25, was unaffected by the substitution at position 46. This suggests that mAb-19 and mAb-25, if they do react with the same epitope, have differences in fine specificity. mAb-22 blocks enzyme activity and belongs to an overlapping complementation group. The fourth mAb, mAb-1, which belongs to a distinct, nonoverlapping, complementation group, does not blocks enzyme activity, and is directed to a region of nuclease that includes the amino acid at position 133. This residue is located a short distance from the active site in a region that has been suggested to participate in binding of DNA, a substrate for nuclease. Therefore, the four epitopes defined by these mAb are localized at or near the enzyme active site.\r"

Using site-directed mutagenesis of the nuclease coding sequences we were able to map the nonoverlapping epitopes recognized by two members of this panel. In the study reported here, we report the generation and analysis of a number of single amino acid substitutions for seven surface residues predicted to lie within one of these two epitopes. Immunochemical analysis showed that one or more substitutions at each of these seven positions had a major effect on mAb binding, whereas other substitutions had none. Based on the nature of these substitutions and the chemical and physical properties of the variant molecules, we believe that any structural effects induced by these substitutions are local and do not result in long-range structural alterations that indirectly influence antibody reactivity. Therefore, we conclude that disruption of mAb binding can be directly attributed to changes in amino acid side chains and that not only are all seven of the residues studied part of the epitope but all seven make contact with the antibody combining site. These studies demonstrate the advantages of using site-directed mutagenesis to study antigen structure and emphasize the importance of constructing the examining multiple substitutions for any given amino acid.\r"

Sequence comparisons indicated that they both correspond to a 1.4-kb mRNA recently cloned from human liver cDNA. The serum concentration of the two glycoproteins together was estimated to be approximately 40 mg/liter. They were found not to exert factor H-like regulatory functions in the alternative pathway. Thus, the 42-kDa glycoprotein described here appears to be distinct from the previously characterized factor H-related protein of similar size, suggesting that human serum contains two factor-H related molecules which both have a molecular mass of 41 to 43 kDa but which differ largely in structure.\r"

  ".W": "We studied neutrophil responses to LPS using three methodologic refinements: Teflon bags or serum-coated glass tubes that did not directly trigger neutrophils, LPS-free cytochrome c to measure O2- release, and heat-inactivated serum to inhibit inactivation of LPS by neutrophils. Neutrophils incubated in uncoated glass or plastic tubes adhered to the glass and released O2-, but were not primed for enhanced release of O2- in response to triggering by FMLP. Triggering by the glass or plastic surface did not occur if the neutrophils were stirred to prevent adherence. Adherence to glass or plastic and O2- release were not affected by a mAb (IB4) directed against the beta-chain of the leukocyte adhesion family of surface glycoproteins (CD11/CD18). Neutrophils incubated in glass or plastic did not show enhanced expression of alkaline phosphatase on their surface. When neutrophils were incubated in serum-coated glass tubes or in Teflon bags, there was no O2- release. However, adherence, expression of alkaline phosphatase, and release of O2- were triggered by adding 1 ng/ml LPS plus 1% serum, but not by either LPS or serum alone. In the presence of LPS and serum, O2- release was much higher when the cells were unstirred (adherent) rather than stirred. However, both unstirred and stirred cells expressed a similar elevated level of alkaline phosphatase. LPS-triggered O2- release and adherence were inhibited by antibody IB4. In contrast, priming by LPS for enhanced FMLP-triggered O2- release was greater in stirred cells than in unstirred cells. The antibody enhanced priming of unstirred neutrophils. These results suggested that uncoated glass or plastic triggered O2- release without involvement of leukocyte adhesion glycoproteins. However, neutrophils incubated with LPS and serum expressed alkaline phosphatase and IB4-inhibitable adherence glycoproteins that allowed neutrophils to interact with serum-coated glass or Teflon to trigger O2- release. Priming by LPS for enhanced response to FMLP was suppressed in adherent neutrophils, and this suppression was partly released by IB4. Thus, triggering and priming were reciprocally regulated by neutrophil glycoproteins interacting with surfaces.\r"

We have studied the effects of in vivo and in vitro differentiation upon cellular content or secretion of a spectrum of neutral proteinases, along with a counter-regulatory metalloproteinase inhibitor (TIMP). We found 1) matrix-degradative serine proteinases (leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G) were lost during cellular maturation and/or differentiation; 2) the 92-kDa type IV/type V collagenase and TIMP were secreted earliest in mononuclear phagocyte differentiation, whereas stromelysin secretion was observed only by LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages; 3) exposure of alveolar macrophages, but not monocytes, to phorbol esters and LPS resulted in markedly augmented secretion of all studied metalloproteinases and TIMP; 4) monocyte-derived macrophages partially (but not completely) mimicked the metalloproteinase secretory phenotype of alveolar macrophages; and 5) the secretory phenotype of alveolar macrophages for interstitial collagenase (but not TIMP) was largely lost during in vitro culture. These results underscore the complexity of the process of differentiation in human mononuclear phagocytes, and provide insights into the variable capacity of mononuclear phagocytes to degrade extracellular matrix components. Moreover, we anticipate that human mononuclear phagocytes at various stages of differentiation will provide a useful model system for study of the variable regulation of secretion of human matrix-degrading metalloproteinases.\r"

  ".W": "Murine macrophage oxidation of L-arginine guanidino nitrogen to nitrite/nitrate yields an intermediate effector, possibly nitric oxide, with antimicrobial activity. Total body nitrogen oxidation metabolism (NOM) was measured in vivo by determining the urinary nitrate excretion of mice ingesting a chemically defined nitrite/nitrate-free diet. As reported previously, mycobacterial infection with bacillus Calmette-Guerin led to a large increase in urinary nitrate excretion. This increase was temporally related to macrophage activation in vivo. The substrate for macrophage nitrogen oxidation metabolism in vitro, L-arginine, was deleted from the diet without ameliorating the urinary nitrate excretion response induced by BCG. This suggested that L-arginine was synthesized endogenously because there are no other known natural substrates for NOM. A competitive inhibitor of NOM, the L-arginine analog, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine was fed to mice in their drinking water. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine ingestion blocked both basal and bacillus Calmette-Guerin-induced urinary nitrate excretion over a 2-4 week time span. These experimental conditions should prove useful for further investigation on the role of macrophage NOM in host defense against intracellular microorganisms.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanisms involved in regulation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by human monocytes, 51Cr-labeled sheep red blood cells (RBC) were used as target cells in vitro. Monocytes incubated overnight at 37 degrees C before addition of SRBC and antibody exhibited a significant decrease in ADCC activity compared with freshly isolated cells. This pattern was observed with monocytes from all donors tested, regardless of the media used for culture. Supernatants from monocyte cultures did not inhibit the cytotoxic ability of fresh monocytes and cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, could not reverse ADCC suppression in cultured monocytes, indicating that the alteration in ADCC is probably not due to inhibitory molecules secreted or synthesized during incubation. A correlation between the decrease in the number of surface FcRI and loss in ADCC ability of cultured monocytes was found. One mechanism for the reduced FcRI expression of 1-day-old monocytes may be rapid internalization that exceeds the rate of reexpression, because cytochalasin-D or monensin, each of which inhibits receptor internalization, maintained FcR expression as well as ADCC ability of cultured monocytes. These data illustrate mechanisms whereby alteration in the number of receptors may underlie loss of receptor-mediated functions, or be involved in augmentation of their biologic activity. The findings that important monocyte functions change under conditions of storage or culture have relevance to in vitro testing of various immune functions of monocytes performed clinically to monitor or guide therapy.\r"

Highly purified monocytes (greater than 90%) were isolated from the leukapheresed blood of normal volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation followed by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation and cultured 7 days in DMEM supplemented with 1000 U/ml macrophage CSF in 10% human serum. Whereas MOLT/4 cells consistently bound freshly prepared 125I-rgp120 at 80% specificity with 5100 +/- 700 mol/cell, MCSF cultured monocytes bound rgp120 at only 0 to 20% specificity and 420 +/- 200 mol/cell. Most of the radioactivity bound by these cells could not be blocked by the addition of unlabeled rgp120. In contrast, the U937 myeloid cell line bound rgp120 with 50% specificity and about 2500 mol/cell. Whereas the antibody OKT4a (anti-CD4) blocked 80% of the binding on MOLT/4 cells and 50% on U937 cells, binding was only inhibited on the average of 6% on cultured monocytes. When soluble rCD4 was used as an inhibitor, binding to MOLT/4 cells was blocked by 80%. In contrast, binding to cultured monocytes was inhibited by 28%. HIV infectivity was blocked by similar concentrations of OKT4a. These observations suggest that although most binding of gp120 to cultured monocytes is not to the CD4 determinant, several hundred molecules do bind to a CD4-like molecule which promotes virus entry and replication.\r"

The data obtained allow us to distinguish three different patterns of response, influenced both by H-2 (class II) and non-H-2 genes. Mice of the C57BL/10 (B10) background carrying H-2 haplotypes b,q, and r were found to be high responders; those carrying H-2 haplotypes d, j, v, and z were low responders; and those with H-2a, H-2f, H-2k, H-2p, and H-2u haplotypes were intermediate responders. Studies with H-2 recombinant strains indicated that the high responsiveness on the B10 background was determined by the Ab allele and the low responsiveness influenced by the Ad allele. Other genes besides H-2 appear to have a role in the immune response as shown by the fact that some strains with BALB, DBA, or C3H background differed in their pattern of responsiveness from B10 background strains carrying the corresponding H-2 haplotypes. By using recombinant protein, the influence of the leishmanial surface lipophosphoglycan that might co-purify with gp63, on the MHC restriction of the response to gp63 was excluded. The immune response to gp63 did not correlate with susceptibility of mouse strains to cutaneous infection with L. mexicana promastigotes.\r"

In this report, we demonstrate that a -143 to -123 bp region that lacks P is sufficient to mediate the W elements function and to bind the W proteins W-B1 and W-B2 in the Raji B-lymphoblastoid cell line. In contrast to previous reports, we find that W/P is not a B cell-specific element; rather that its promoter activity parallels active transcription of the endogenous DRA gene. In addition, we show that tissue-restricted regulation by W/P is not correlated with the ubiquitous (W-B1) and lymphoid-specific (W-B2) distribution of the W binding proteins. We suggest that mechanisms in addition to binding to W may account for W/P-dependent transcriptional activation in DR+ cells.\r"

This putative gene, referred to as ll (long-lived), causes a significant delay in expression of autoimmune serology (total serum IgG and anti-nuclear antibodies levels), monocytosis, and of immune complex-mediated histopathologic changes such as glomerulonephritis, arteritis, and myocardial infarction. Presumably as a consequence of the delayed immunopathology male BXSB/MpJScr-ll/ll mice live three to four times longer than regular BXSB/MpJScr.

Neither IL-2 nor IL-6 increased LGL cytotoxic potential in a parallel estimation of heteroconjugated antibody (anti-CD16 x anti-nitrophenyl mAb)-dependent cytotoxicity against nitrophenyl-modified YAC. Unlike IL-2, IL-6 did not significantly induce LGL lymphokine-activated killer activity, LGL proliferation, or LGL lymphokine production. In particular, IL-6 did not stimulate detectable LGL IL-2 production or IL-2R modulation, and mAb to the p75 IL-2R had no effect on IL-6 induction of LGL NK activity. Therefore, in the absence of T cells, IL-6 provided an IL-2-independent signal to LGL that resulted in augmentation of their NK activity without stimulating their proliferation or other LGL functions.\r"

The four promoters were functional only in epithelial cells. Although the promoter for the basal cell-specific, acidic-type K14 gene was active in all epithelial cells tested, its basic-type partner, K5, and the promoter for the hyper-proliferation-associated K6 were active only in primary cultures of stratified epithelia. The promoter for the epidermal differentiation-specific K10 keratin gene was active at a low level in primary cultures of stratified epithelial cells on non-epidermal origin. Thus, the K14 gene promoter is functional in all epithelial cells, but the upstream regions of the K5 and K6 keratin genes restrict their expression to stratified epithelia, whereas the epidermal determinants of the K10 gene are not in the proximal upstream sequences.\r"

A reasonable match of donor age and gender, site, and passage number was achieved. Contrary to an earlier report, the lines from the Pasini group were unexceptional in the amount of GAG they secreted and the proportions of sulfated and nonsulfated GAG showed no consistent difference from the Cockayne-Touraine or control lines. The Pasini lines secreted 77 +/- 18 (SEM) microgram GAG-uronic acid per 10(7) cells and the Cockayne-Touraine lines 81 +/- 12 micrograms at equivalent cells densities.

This device, when placed against the skin, allows collection and quantitation of chemicals that diffuse directly through the skin from within the body. The relationship of the amount of drug collected in the TCD to the amount in the body available for collection (as represented by the area under the plasma-concentration time curve, AUC) and the effects of sweating, a potential confounding factor, on collection of drug in a TCD were studied, using caffeine as a model compound. TCD were placed on the skin of normal male volunteers. Twenty-four hours later subjects took caffeine by mouth. Blood samples were collected and TCD were removed at various times after drug intake and analyzed by HPLC for caffeine. Studies of the sweating effect were carried out in a similar manner, except that one arm of each subject was maintained at 40 degrees C to induce local sweating, the other arm acted as a non-sweating control. The amount of caffeine collected was linearly related to the AUC. Sweating seemed to have a large (40%) contribution to transdermal collection in the early period (5.5 h) of the study, but this difference was much less (14%) at longer collection times (10 h).\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have linked epidermal cholesterol synthesis with maintenance of the permeability barrier. To assess directly the importance of cholesterol synthesis, we applied lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, to hairless mouse skin. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) began to increase after four to six daily applications. Co-application of cholesterol blocked the expected increase in TEWL, demonstrating the importance of cholesterol for development of the lesion. The histology of lovastatin-treated skin revealed epidermal hyperplasia, accompanied by accelerated DNA synthesis. Whereas cholesterol synthesis initially was reduced in lovastatin-treated epidermis, with further treatment cholesterol synthesis normalized, while fatty acid synthesis accelerated greatly. Although the total free sterol content of lovastatin-treated epidermis remained normal, the fatty acid content increased coincident with barrier disruption. Finally, morphologic abnormalities of both lamellar body structure and their deposited, intercellular contents occurred coincident with the emerging biochemical abnormalities. Thus, the abnormal barrier function in this model can be ascribed to an initial inhibition of epidermal sterol synthesis followed by an alteration in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to an imbalance in stratum corneum lipid composition and abnormal membrane bilayer structure.\r"

In the present study, we employed dopa and indirect immunoperoxidase techniques in epidermal sheets to determine the fate of melanocytes and LC of aged versus young donors after skin transplantations onto nude mice. The detection of positive homologous leucocytic antibody reaction of degeneration (HLA-DR) of LC indicates an age-associated reduction in sun-protected thigh skin in aged versus young subjects (263 +/- 63 versus 589.25 +/- 142.643, p less than 0.001). The mean number of LC four weeks after transplantation remained almost constant. Prior to skin engraftment, a decreased number of melanocytes was found in aged versus young epidermis (160.77 +/- 51.7 versus 255.83 +/- 81.2, respectively, p less than 0.05). A significantly increased number of melanocytes was noted four weeks following engraftment in epidermis from aged (307.44 +/- 174, p less than 0.05) and young human donors (402.16 +/- 139, p less than 0.02). The marked increase in density of dopa-positive melanocytes following engraftment onto nude mice may indicate the existence of circulating factors in nude mice that perhaps both stimulates and enhances proliferation and activity of these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the importance of intercellular lamellar bilayers for stratum corneum (SC) barrier function, knowledge about the structure of these bilayers is limited due to their poor visualization and/or retention. Whereas substitution of ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4) for osmium tetroxide fixation provides clear images of these bilayers, the usefulness of RuO4 has been limited by its slow penetration and cytotoxicity. Utilizing a new fixation protocol for RuO4, we obtained clear images of lamellar domains at all levels of murine SC. Computer-aided image reconstructions demonstrated a lamellar spacing of 129 +/- 2 A, which agreed with x-ray diffraction data from parallel, unfixed samples (131 +/- 2 A), a spacing not affected by hydration. Furthermore, novel structures were seen in the intercellular spaces of normal SC. Finally, in murine essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), the overall lamellar spacing is comparable to normal [127 +/- 7 A by computer transform vs. 131.9 +/- 2 A (hydrated) and 129.6 +/- 2.2 A (dry) by x-ray diffraction]. Yet, these domains are structurally abnormal, displaying regions with either an excess or absence of lamellae. The new RuO4 protocol provides quantitative information about SC lamellar dimensions and morphologic abnormalities in bilayer distribution and substructure in EFAD stratum corneum that are not detected by either x-ray diffraction or computer-aided image reconstruction. Thus, the barrier abnormality in EFAD stratum corneum can be ascribed either to focal depletion of lamellae or abnormalities in lamellar substructure.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular Ca++ ([Ca++]i) is one of the most important second messengers of extracellular signals that induce cellular responses. In epidermal keratinocytes, both extracellular and intracellular Ca++ are reported to be important to cell differentiation and proliferation. Several mechanisms that increase [Ca++]i have been elicited in various tissues; however, in epidermal keratinocytes they remain unknown. Thus, we investigated the [Ca++]i modulation in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes and the stimulation that increases the concentration. The [Ca++]i concentration of keratinocytes was increased immediately and transiently by epinephrine. Methoxamine hydrochloride and clonidine (alpha-1- and 2-adrenergic agonists) did not induce an increase in [Ca++]i. The beta-antagonist, propranolol, inhibited the [Ca++]i increase induced by epinephrine and salbutamol (a beta-2-agonist). These results reveal that the beta-adrenergic stimulation induces an immediate and transient [Ca++]i increase in human keratinocytes. Beta-adrenergic stimulation is known to induce adenylate cyclase activation, which results in cyclic AMP accumulation through stimulatory guanosine 5-triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins in the keratinocytes. Also, epinephrine is reported to inhibit cultured epidermal cell proliferation. The effect of epinephrine has been demonstrated by cyclic AMP accumulation; however, beta-adrenergic stimulation revealed a [Ca++]i increase in keratinocytes in our study. One of epinephrine's regulatory effects on epidermal cell proliferation is assumed to occur through the [Ca++]i increase as well.\r"

We looked for TNF-alpha/cachectin in three tumor cell lines derived from human malignant melanomas and six co-cultivated malignant melanomas derived, in vitro, from these three cell lines plus angioma fibroblasts. Immunohistochemistry with an anti-TNF-alpha/cachectin monoclonal antibody showed that TNF-alpha/cachectin was produced by two of the three parent melanoma cell lines. All the tumor cells in both the co-cultivated malignant melanomas and their in vitro tumorous nodules produced TNF-alpha/cachectin, even those derived from the melanoma cell line, which originally did not. The results clearly show that TNF-alpha/cachectin can be produced by non-hematopoietic tumor cells. A co-cultivated tumor model prepared from other types of human tumor cell lines promises to provide a useful tool for exploring the relationship between TNF-alpha/cachectin and oncogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of recombinant human Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on collagen biosynthesis were studied in vitro using dermal fibroblast cultures. Both forms of IL-1 and TNF-alpha induced a dose-dependent inhibition of both types I and III collagen synthesis, as measured by radioimmunoassay, gel electrophoresis, or collagenase-sensitive material. This effect was accompanied by a significant release of prostaglandin E2 into the culture medium. However, indomethacin, a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, could not prevent the inhibitory effect of the three cytokines on collagen synthesis. Measurement of type I and type III procollagen mRNA levels in IL-1 treated cells revealed that both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were potent enhancers of procollagen gene expression at pretranslational level. On the other hand, TNF-alpha was found to reduce the steady-state levels of type I and III procollagen mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha transcripts following TNF-alpha treatment of fibroblasts indicated that this cytokine can induce IL-1 beta gene expression in these cells. By contrast, TNF-alpha mRNA remained at a constant level after TNF-alpha exposure. These data suggest that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, two cytokines that share several biologic activities, modulate collagen deposition in dermal fibroblasts by mechanisms that are clearly different: TNF-alpha appears to act at a transcriptional level to inhibit collagen synthesis, whereas IL-1 inhibitory action involves important translational regulation, still unknown, that counterbalances its stimulatory effect on procollagen mRNA levels. Moreover, our data suggest the existence of local fibroblastic cytokine production that may be involved in the modulation of extracellular matrix deposition.\r"

Four had the cytologic characteristics of Bowen's disease (SCC-BD) and 16 did not have them (SCC-NB). Tumors were studied immunohistochemically by double immunofluorescent staining by using mouse monoclonal antibodies to the core protein of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and chondroitin 6-sulfate glycosaminoglycan (Ch6S) as well as rabbit antiserum to laminin (LN) and type IV collagen (C-4). In well-differentiated and highly keratinized SCC-NB, LN, C-4, and HSPG could be detected in the tumor nest BM and showed no loss of continuity, but they were largely lost in poorly differentiated and poorly keratinized SCC-NB. This suggests that poorly differentiated SCC-NB cause greater enzymatic degradation of BM components than well-differentiated SCC-NB. Ch6S was detected in parts of the BM of SCC-BD, but it was absent in all SCC-NB examined. It appears that SCC-NB have lost the ability to synthesize Ch6S, and that SCC-BD degrade Ch6S although they continue to produce it. Thus, it appears that in SCC the BM is qualitatively different from that of normal epidermis, and that SCC-BD can be distinguished from SCC-NB by the Ch6S content of the BM.\r"

Lipid peroxidation, activities of antioxidant enzymes, and percentage amounts of 14C-arachidonic acid in various cellular lipid subclasses and in the culture medium were measured. Both UVA irradiation and PUVA treatment induced significant changes in the distribution of arachidonic acid and increased the liberation of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. At 24 h after either UVA irradiation or PUVA treatment the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive material was significantly increased, whereas the amount of conjugated dienes was unaffected. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase, were already significantly decreased at 0.5 h after UVA irradiation or PUVA treatment. The enzyme activities were partially restored during the following 24 h incubation. From the present study, we suggest that in keratinocytes both plain UVA irradiation and PUVA treatment induce changes in the distribution of membrane fatty acids and cause an impairment in the enzymic defense system against oxidative stress.\r"

Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the 190-kd polypeptide was secreted into the culture medium in 2 h and processed to the 120-kd collagen component within 4 h. This process was inhibited by EDTA. The 120-kd polypeptide was sensitive to pepsin, and a 50-kd fragment was produced by a mild pepsin treatment at 4 degrees C. A cyanogen bromide peptide map of the 120-kd polypeptide was distinct from that of types I, II, III, IV, and V collagens. These properties indicate similarities to the type VIII-related collagen produced by human astrocytoma cells. The secretion of the collagen rapidly reached a maximum level on the first day of culture and subsequently declined with cell proliferation. An accelerated processing to the 120-kd polypeptide was observed under culture conditions of high cell density. Similar collagens were also found to be produced by normal human keratinocytes. These results indicate that the 120-kd polypeptide is a potentially functional protein that may participate in the formation of the extracellular matrix of keratinocytes.\r"

The two variants, pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris, can be distinguished at the molecular level by immunochemical studies. The large majority of patients with pemphigus develop the disease spontaneously; however, there is a small group of patients who develop pemphigus after treatment with certain medications, of which penicillamine and captopril are the best documented. Most patients with drug-induced pemphigus have circulating and/or tissue bound epidermal cell surface autoantibodies; however, the molecular specificity of these autoantibodies has not been studied. We performed immunoprecipitation studies utilizing extracts of 125I-labeled suction blister epidermis and the sera of three patients with drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus (two due to penicillamine and one due to captopril) and one patient with captopril-induced pemphigus vulgaris. We found that the three patients with drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus had circulating autoantibodies that are directed against the pemphigus foliaceus antigen complex and that the one patient with drug-induced pemphigus vulgaris had circulating autoantibodies that are directed against the pemphigus vulgaris antigen complex. This study demonstrates that autoantibodies from drug-induced pemphigus patients have the same antigenic specificity, on a molecular level, as do autoantibodies from other pemphigus patients.\r"

PTHRP is present throughout the viable portion of the epidermis, in adnexal epithelial cells, and in all cultivated keratinocytes.

Type I transglutaminase activity is responsible for cell envelope formation in terminally differentiating cultured keratinocytes. Transglutaminase enzymatic activity has been associated with several proteins that are differentially expressed in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the relationship between the epidermally expressed transglutaminases, cDNA for type I transglutaminase was cloned from a human high-calcium keratinocyte lambda gt11 library. cDNA fragments, generated by PCR primed with a mixture of oligonucleotides coding for five invariant amino acids in the active site, were used as a screening probe. Based on the sequence analysis of 1653 nt contained in the lambda 1-126a clone and on the pattern of expression of a complementary approximately 3-kb transcript, we report cloning of the epidermal type I transglutaminase gene. The expression of this gene is regulated by calcium ions and retinoic acid in cultured human keratinocytes. There are highly conserved regions near the active site cysteine residues that may be important for the enzyme's specialized functions.\r"

In Northern and dot-blot analysis, the TPA-induced increase in ODC mRNA was shown to be markedly reduced by the same dose of BHA (the inhibition rate at 4 h was about 60%).

  ".W": "Traumatic head injury is the principal cause of death and serious physical disability in adolescents and young adult. Hearing loss is a common sequela of head trauma. The results of pure tone and auditory brain-stem response (ABR) assessment of minor head injury revealed that 20 per cent of these cases showed impairment of hearing including both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss mostly in the high frequencies loss. ABR findings showed a significant difference of absolute wave V latency and interwave (III-V) latencies at repetition rate 11.1 click/sec., and a highly significant difference at a repetition rate of 51.1 click/sec., compared with the control group. In severe head injury, conductive hearing loss was found in only one case, in which a longitudinal fracture of the temporal bone was identified radiologically. No ABR could be recorded at a repetition rate of 11.1 click/sec. in either ear of this case; this patient died a few days later. Three cases were found with a mixed sensorineural hearing loss; one of them showed a longitudinal fracture radiologically. ABR findings in two cases showed prolongation of wave V and I-V interwave latencies, and the third case showed absence of ABR recording. In comatose patients, an ABR grading system is a more sensitive index of brainstem dysfunction than the simple division of normal versus abnormal ABR waves and interwave latencies. Presence or prolongation of wave V and interwave latency I-V even in one ear is of good prognostic value in the comatosed patient.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies on daily tympanometric screening using an automatic impedance tympanoscope indicated relatively high incidences of type B tympanograms of one day's duration, which is contrary to our conceptions of the pathogenesis and pathology of otitis media with effusion. We therefore repeated the study in 51 otherwise healthy children (100 ears) attending kindergarten. Tympanometry was performed daily for one month using both the conventional impedance apparatus AZ7 and the automatic impedance tympanoscope ZS 331. The impedance apparatus did not indicate any one-day type B tympanograms and only a few short-lasting episodes occurring either in the beginning or end of the study period. Several ears had type B tympanograms on all days examined. The point prevalence was 15 per cent and the period prevalence 17 per cent, which accord well with findings of previous epidemiological studies of secretory otitis. The impedance tympanoscope indicated 16 cases of B-curves lasting only one day and considerably higher point and period prevalences, which make the impedance tympanoscope unsuited for both scientific and clinical purposes.\r"

In this series done during the last four years, of 576 tympanoplasties, 240 cases needed type III tympanoplasty. In 145 cases, myringostapediopexy was carried out using temporalis fascia grafting over the head of the stapes. Tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy was performed in the other 95 cases by using tragal cartilage and perichondrium over the stapes. A comparison between the results of both methods of grafting is discussed. Improvement in hearing was achieved after tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy. This method proved to be suitable for those cases which need open technique tympanoplasty.\r"

A number of reports in the literature have cited both patients who had preservation of hearing despite widespread erosion of the labyrinth by cholesteatoma and patients who had retained auditory function despite surgical removal of the matrix from the labyrinth. In most cases the vestibular portion of the inner ear was invaded but cases of cochlear involvement have been described as well. Twelve cases with pre-operative auditory function preservation despite extensive labyrinthine destruction treated at our Institution are reported. Seven cases retained cochlear function post-operatively. Possible explanations of this occurrence and implications of related with hearing preservation in the presence of widespread inner ear destruction by chronic inflammatory disease are discussed.\r"

Lack of familiarity with this condition amongst present day otologists may lead to late diagnosis and treatment. We review three cases that we have managed recently and compare their clinical courses with the classic description of the disease.\r"

This relationship was previously studied by Parahy and Linthicum. It was found that the larger the amount of hyalinization, the greater the hearing loss. This hyalinization is a measure of the amount of toxic enzymes being excreted into the inner ear fluid. These enzymes are suspected to affect the metabolic function of the hair cells.\r"

Sodium supplement was necessary to maintain normal sodium balance. The salivary sodium concentrations were markedly elevated, with sweat sodium levels being in the upper normal range. Urinary sodium concentration and renal epithelial exchange between sodium and potassium were normal. This was felt to be due to an autosomal recessive disorder. Both siblings were later diagnosed as having a bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss with intermittent conductive overlay due to middle ear fluid. The sensorineural loss was also felt to be autosomal recessive in origin, but the possibility of a disturbance of sodium balance in the inner ear has been questioned.\r"

Degeneration and regeneration of the olfactory mucosa were examined, histopathologically and immunohistochemically. We used antisera to olfactory marker protein (OMP) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) as a marker of the mature olfactory receptor neurons. Following rapid degeneration after bulbectomy, the olfactory receptor neurons regenerated. OMP and NSE containing cells re-appeared 49 days later. However, the cell population of the neuroepithelium did not revert to the numbers observed in the non-operated neuroepithelium, even three months later. The lack of a connection between regenerated axons and the olfactory bulb may result in immature neuronal replacement and reduce the number of olfactory receptor neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Adenoid enlargement is uncommon in adults and because examination of the nasopharynx by indirect posterior rhinoscopy is inadequate, many cases of enlarged adenoid in adults are misdiagnosed and accordingly maltreated. This study was conducted on 35 cases of enlarged adenoid aged between 20 and 42 years. The nasal endoscope was utilized to identify the adenoid mass. Adenoidectomy under transnasal endoscopic control was performed and all the excised material was sent for histopathological examination. Adenoidectomy resulted in marked improvement in 94 per cent of cases without major complications. Histopathological examination revealed non-specific inflammatory reaction in 15 cases (43 per cent), pure reactive changes, predominantly follicular hyperplasia, in two cases (6 per cent) and mixed pattern in 18 cases (51 per cent). Endoscopic follow-up for an average 17 months identified recurrence in only two patients. It was concluded that enlarged adenoid tissue in adults has some histopathological differences from that in children and adenoidectomy under transnasal endoscopic control is safe and reliable.\r"

Clinical, radiological and scintigraphic features have been compared with the detailed histology of the bone. This study confirms the usefulness of superior marginal resections in lesions which are close to but not involving the mandible, as well as for superficial lesions which are actually seen to involve the mandible but their CT and bone scans are negative for tumour invasion.\r"
