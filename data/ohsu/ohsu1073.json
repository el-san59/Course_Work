Although the origins of amylase in dust are unclear, enzyme activity correlated with mite counts (n = 40; r = 0.35; p less than 0.05) and Der p I concentrations (r = 0.41; p less than 0.01). Mite amylase was purified from spent growth medium by affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and chromatofocusing. It was physicochemically similar to mammalian amylase with regard to molecular weight (60,000), charge heterogeneity (isoelectric point, 5 to 7) and the capacity to bind to an organomercurial affinity matrix. The optimum pH for enzymatic activity was revealed to be 6.4. IgE immunoblot studies demonstrated that the enzyme was allergenic and that its expression was dependent on the integrity of intrachain disulfide bonds. Sera from 25% of mite-allergic children and 46% of mite-allergic adults contained specific IgE to mite amylase. IgE to amylase was associated (p less than 0.01) with increased concentrations of total mite-specific IgE determined with a direct RAST assay.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on ion transport function of airway epithelial cells, we studied bioelectric properties of cultured tracheal and bronchial epithelia from dogs under short-circuit conditions in vitro. Addition of PAF (10(-5) mol/L) to mucosal solution of Ussing chamber increased short-circuit current of tracheal epithelium from 3.3 +/- 0.7 to 8.5 +/- 1.2 microA/cm2 (p less than 0.001). This effect was dose dependent, and there was a corresponding increase in transepithelial potential difference. In contrast, PAF was without effect when it was added to the submucosal side. Electrical properties of bronchial epithelium remained unchanged by PAF. The PAF-induced increase in short-circuit current was not affected by amiloride but abolished by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, bumetanide, or Cl-free medium. The effects of PAF were not altered by AA-861 or U-60257, but attenuated by indomethacin and piroxicam, and dose-dependently blocked by CV 6209 and WEB 2086. Mucosal, but not submucosal, addition of PAF increased the rate of prostaglandin release from tracheal epithelium. These results suggest that PAF selectively stimulates Cl secretion across tracheal epithelium, probably through activation of its specific receptors and the subsequent production of prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism(s) underlying mucus hypersecretion (bronchorrhea) and the treatment of this condition are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that erythromycin inhibited mucus secretion from human airways and from secretory epithelial cells in vitro. We encountered a patient with airway obstruction marked by severe bronchorrhea, who previously had responded only to inhaled bronchodilators and high-dose prednisone. Many attempts to wean him from prednisone had failed. During the course of his disease, he had developed an IgG antibody to vasoactive intestinal peptide, had increased amounts of mucus secreted by his respiratory epithelial cells, and demonstrated hyperreactive airways as measured by methacholine challenge provocation test. Erythromycin was added to his therapy. The effect of erythromycin treatment was quite dramatic and included clinical and laboratory improvement. After a short trial of erythromycin, the patient tolerated low, every-other-day doses of prednisone. there was a significant reduction in the volume of his bronchorrhea, a major decrease in the epithelial mucins in his total expectorated mucus, complete inhibition of his airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine, and significant reduction in the level of IgG antibody to vasoactive intestinal peptide. This response was specific for erythromycin since other antibiotics did not have any clinical, biochemical, or physiologic effects. We conclude that erythromycin may play a role in the treatment of patients with bronchorrhea and may have a steroid-sparing effect. Additional studies with larger numbers of patients are indicated.\r"

We affinity purified the allergens, Can f I and \"dog allergen 2\" with Cf-1a and Cf-2 ascites, respectively, and house dust-rich dog dander. Comparison of purified Can f I with dog saliva in RAST demonstrated that Can f I is a potent allergen for most dog-allergic patients (average response, 70%). After depletion of dog saliva of Can f I, a slightly lower contribution for Can f I was found, but the overall results supported the conclusion that Can f I is a major allergen in dog saliva. Comparison of purified dog allergen 2 with dog dander in RAST demonstrated that dog allergen 2 is less important for dog-allergic patients (average response, 23%). We radiolabeled the purified allergens and developed assays to measure Can f I and dog allergen 2 in allergen extracts and dust samples. Dog saliva was a strong allergen source, dog urine and feces contained very little of the allergens, and both allergens were found to a variable degree in the nine dog breeds tested.\r"

Histamine hydrochloride (10 and 100 mg/ml) and codeine phosphate (9%) were tested by prick test. Substance P (50 and 500 ng per injection site), phentolamine (20 micrograms per injection site), and carbachol (1 microgram per injection site) were tested by intradermal skin tests. Skin mast cells were also microscopically examined in 10 patients with lung cancer, five with breast cancer, and 10 normal subjects. The mean wheal sizes induced by all the tested substances were similar in patients with cancer and chronic bronchitis and in normal individuals. The flare to histamine, codeine phosphate, and substance P was completely abolished in 7/22 patients with lung cancer, but the lack of flare was not related to the age of the patients, nor to the staging of cancer, nor to metastasis. The mean numbers of alcian blue-stained or toluidine blue-stained positive mast cells were similar in normal subjects and in subjects with cancer. This study does not confirm the skin hyporeactivity of patients with cancer.\r"

Sera of cockroach-allergic patients with asthma, 10 from Chicago, Ill. (C group) and six patients from Lexington, Ky. (L group), were used; results were then compared with sera of control subjects with asthma. Qualitative differences in protein bands were noted among CRa-A, CRa-G, and CRa-O by crossed immunoelectrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Allergen bands on Western blot were analyzed for distribution by molecular weight (MW) with relative intensity scores. Results were compared by species and by geography. Two to 12 allergenic bands of variable MW (14 kd to greater than 116 kd) were identified by 13 of 16 individual sera from cockroach-allergic patients from all three extracts. CRa-A demonstrated 55 bands with an intensity score of 125; CRa-G, 58 bands with an intensity score of 100; and CRa-O, 51 bands with an intensity score of 108. Allergenic bands of CRa-A were identified by six sera of the C group and one sera of the L group, whereas bands of both CRa-G and CRa-O were noted by nine sera of the C group and four sera of the L group. All three species had an allergen band in MW range of 40 to 45 kd that reacted to most sera from cockroach-allergic patients with asthma.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effective sites of airway response to atropine and fenoterol aerosols and to the intravenous injection of aminophylline in patients with stable and spontaneous asthma, by the simultaneous assessment of respiratory resistance (Rrs) and anatomic dead space (VD). Central airway response was determined by VD, and overall response was determined by Rrs. Peripheral airway response was inferred from Rrs when the change in VD was slight. Atropine (4 mg/ml) or fenoterol (0.4 mg/ml) was continuously inhaled during tidal breathing for 5 minutes. Inhalation of both atropine and fenoterol increased Grs (reciprocal of Rrs) (p less than 0.01) with a simultaneous increase in VD (p less than 0.01) in the patients with stable and spontaneous asthma. Fenoterol increased Grs more than did atropine at an equivalent increase in VD in patients with spontaneous asthma (p less than 0.05). Intravenous injection of aminophylline (250 mg) had no effect on either Grs or VD in patients with stable asthma, but it significantly increased Grs (p less than 0.01) without change in VD in patients with spontaneous asthma. These results suggest that the predominant sites of bronchodilation induced by inhaled atropine are the central airways, that those sites induced by intravenous injection of aminophylline are the peripheral airways, and that inhaled fenoterol dilates both the central and peripheral airways in subjects with asthma. Differences among clinically used bronchodilators on the effective sites may be considered in the treatment of bronchial asthma.\r"

The FP was demonstrated to bind to the IgE antibodies (Abs) of greater than or equal to 95% of 55 individual sera examined. A positive correlation (r = 0.90) was observed between the levels of IgE Abs corresponding to the FP and the grass-pollen extract(s). With sera of five allergic patients, the IgE binding of three different protein preparations were compared, namely, KBG pollen proteins, 27 to 35 kd gel-purified pollen proteins, and the FP. Results indicated that about 50% of the total IgE binding of KBG pollen proteins was due to the IgE Abs specific to FP. Comparison of the above protein preparations with respect to their abilities to specifically stimulate murine popliteal lymph node cells in vitro indicated that the total pollen proteins stimulated the highest proliferation of lymph node cells. Interestingly, the FP supported higher proliferation of lymph node cells than the gel-purified proteins. Collectively, these results suggest that the recombinant peptide constitutes a major allergenic constituent of grass pollens and may be of diagnostic and therapeutic value.\r"

In the present study, we assessed the cytotoxicity of human EOSs from peripheral blood of patients with eosinophilia and from peritoneal fluid of patients undergoing continuous peritoneal dialysis and compared them to normal neutrophils. Cytotoxicity was measured by the release of 51chromium from cultured tumor cells and chicken erythrocytes. Both EOSs and neutrophils were separated on discontinuous Percoll gradients with greater than 95% purity. The granulocytes were activated by preincubation in an ice bath with phorbol myristate acetate and washed before incubation with the target cells. The EOSs lysed significantly more tumor cells (K562, Raji, and CEM lines) in an 18-hour assay than did neutrophils, and no significant difference was found between the peritoneal and blood EOSs. The EOSs were also much more efficient than neutrophils in lysing chicken erythrocytes when they were activated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor instead of phorbol myristate acetate. Cytolysis by EOSs is mediated by both oxidative and nonoxidative mechanisms, as indicated by experiments with cells from patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Thus, EOSs are much more cytotoxic than neutrophils and potentially much more damaging to patients with eosinophilia.\r"

Attempts to hyposensitize this response in allergic individuals have depended on the administration of extracts of specific allergen. However, the ability of peptides derived from unrelated antigens to inhibit specific immune responses offers an alternative approach to therapy. We have addressed this question by examining the ability of a nonstimulatory peptide analogue derived from influenza virus hemagglutinin to modulate T cell recognition of house dust mite. The peptide inhibited the response of mite-specific CD4+ T cell clones restricted by either the HLA-DRAB1 or DRAB3 gene products. Furthermore, mite-induced polyclonal T cell responses were negatively modulated by the peptide, whereas recognition of common recall antigens remained intact. The inhibitory effects were mediated at the level of the antigen-presenting cell, since no inhibition of mitogen or anti-CD3 antibody-driven T cell proliferation was observed. In direct binding assays, the peptide analogue bound to selected HLA-DR molecules expressed on the membrane of antigen-presenting cells, with specificity predominantly for those class II proteins capable of restricting house dust mite-allergen T cell recognition.\r"

Eighty-three hospitalized patients with asthma were challenged with exercise. The patients were examined according to a standardized protocol that comprised 8 minutes of bicycling at 90% of predicted heart rate. An LAR after EC was considered to have occurred when there was a fall in peak expiratory flow rate greater than or equal to 20% on three or more time points on the exercise day compared to corresponding clock time on a control day. According to these criteria, 11 patients (13.3%) experienced an LAR. Those patients were rechallenged 21 to 150 days after the first EC, without changing the therapy regimen of the patients, to study its reproducibility. Eight patients (73%) demonstrated a reproducible LAR after EC based on the criteria for a positive LAR. Although the LAR after EC was reproducible, the time points at which the LAR took place after the second EC differed from LARs after the first EC. Our results indicate that the LAR after EC occurs in a considerable number of patients with bronchial asthma and is quite reproducible.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) generally fail to produce antigen-specific IgG. We have identified a lymphokine called high molecular weight B cell growth factor (HMW BCGF) that expands an IgG-producing subpopulation of B cells. The B cells from 15 of 16 patients with CVI evaluated in this study failed to proliferate to HMW BCGF, although they proliferated normally to another BCGF, low molecular weight BCGF (LMW BCGF). Nevertheless, 11 patients had more than normal numbers of B cells expressing HMW BCGF receptors. The HMW BCGF receptors on the B cells of three patients with CVI studied were the same molecular weight as the normal HMW BCGF receptor. Examination of B cells from four patients with CVI for intracellular signals produced in normal B cells after stimulation with HMW BCGF revealed that B cells from patients with CVI failed to developed significant increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate or phosphoinositides after HMW BCGF stimulation. However, cytoplasmic phosphoinositides in the B cells from all four patients with CVI were already increased above what is observed in normal B cells before stimulation with HMW BCGF (either freshly isolated or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I-activated B cell). Thus, the failure of B cells from patients with CVI to respond to HMW BCGF may be related to their abnormal activation in vivo. Since HMW BCGF expands a subpopulation of memory B cells, the inability of CVI B cells to respond to HMW BCGF may contribute to their abnormal secondary responses to antigens.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported differences in mediator release during equivalent levels of antigen (Ag)-induced smooth muscle contraction of guinea pig pulmonary tissues after passive sensitization with IgG1 versus IgE antibodies (Abs). In the present study, we have examined the influence of indomethacin (5 x 10(-6) mol/L) and L-cysteine (3 or 10 mmol/L) on mediator release from superfused trachea taken from guinea pigs passively sensitized with IgG1 or IgE Ab 1 day before in vitro studies. Tissues were challenged with Ag (oxazolone-human serum albumin conjugate), and contractions and superfusate histamine and peptidoleukotrienes were monitored at discrete time intervals thereafter. Superfusate mediator contents were determined by spectrophotofluorimetry (histamine) and RAST (peptidoleukotrienes). The profiles of peptidoleukotrienes were examined with high-pressure liquid chromatography. At equivalent levels of contraction, significantly less histamine and peptidoleukotrienes were found in superfusate samples after sensitization with IgE Abs. None of the drug pretreatments significantly altered Ag-induced histamine release after IgG1 or IgE sensitization. Indomethacin resulted in an increase in total measurable peptidoleukotrienes found only after IgG1 receptor activation, but it did prolong tracheal contractions with both Abs. L-cysteine, 10 mmol/L, resulted in an increase in total measurable superfusate peptidoleukotriene content under all experimental conditions. The percentage increase in peptidoleukotriene content from that found without drug pretreatment was larger in the case of IgE compared to IgG1 sensitization. During early time periods, after Ag challenge, measurable peptidoleukotriene levels in superfusate samples were similar for both Abs in the presence of L-cysteine, 10 mmol/L. These data suggest that there is a differential pattern of peptidoleukotriene metabolism after activation of IgG1 versus IgE receptors in guinea pig trachea.\r"

Subjects with asthma between the ages of 6 and 59 years presenting for acute ER care for asthma were systematically assigned by alternating, consecutively, the day of their ER visit to receive either (1) facilitated referral to an asthma specialist within the allergy department and concomitant comprehensive ongoing asthma care (intervention group, n = 149) or (2) continued outpatient management from generalist physicians (control group, n = 160). The course of their asthma was evaluated blindly during the subsequent 6 months by review of medical records, initial and follow-up questionnaires, and spirometry. Compared to the control group, the intervention group noted (1) a 75% reduction in the number of, and percent of, subjects with asthma awakenings per night (p less than or equal to 0.0001), (2) an almost 50% reduction in asthma ER relapses (p = 0.017) resulting from a reduction in the frequency of multiple relapse (p = 0.005), and (3) a greater use of inhaled corticosteroids (p less than 0.00001) and cromolyn (p = 0.002). Thus, facilitated referral of subjects with asthma to specialists in asthma therapy after acute ER therapy appears to reduce asthma ER relapses and to improve asthma outcome.\r"

For both cord blood cotinine and maternal urine continine creatinine ratio (CCR), significantly higher levels were observed for smokers compared to nonsmokers. Furthermore, among nonsmokers, passive smokers had significantly higher cotinine levels than true nonsmokers, which demonstrates that cord blood may be used to assess active as well as passive maternal smoking. No association was observed in this study between cord blood IgE and maternal smoking assessed by questionnaire (geometric means of cord blood IgE levels were 0.11 IU/ml for newborn infants of smoking mothers and 0.12 IU/ml for newborn infants of nonsmoking mothers). The same observations were drawn from the analysis of cord blood IgE and cotinine levels, with correlation coefficients of -0.005 for cord blood CCR and 0.003 for maternal CCR. Additional studies are needed to determine whether maternal smoking is causally related to cord blood IgE and by which mechanisms.\r"

Some highly touted and routinely used devices for intravenous (IV) infusion have recently been shown to be, at least in part, defective. A tubing with an in-line 150 mu filter (150 mu High-Flow Blood Filter; Saftifilter Blood Administration Sets; Cutter Biological, Berkeley, CA 94710) has recently been introduced to facilitate rapid blood transfusion. It is claimed that at least 8.5 units of blood can be rapidly run through each set before replacement is necessary. To test this under simulated clinical conditions, four sets of ten random units of outdated erythrocytes at 4 to 9 degrees C were each admixed with 250 mL 70 degrees C 0.9 NaCl and infused through the system under a constant 300 mmHg pressure. Two sets infused through unmodified tubing flowed at an average of 25 mL/sec (1500 mL/min) before there was an appreciable slowing of the flow rate. Two sets with 8 Fr catheters attached infused at an average of 22 mL/sec (1320 mL/min) before there was an appreciable slowing of the flow rate. Even after the flow slowed, the 9th and 10th units infused at an average greater than 10 mL/sec (600 mL/min). The tubing/filter exceeded the manufacturer's published claims. This tubing/filter appears to be one element that could be an effective component of a high-flow infusion system.\r"

This retrospective study was done to determine if a statistically significant relationship existed between the degree of calculus-related ureteral obstruction, proven by IVP, and the presence or absence of microscopic hematuria. Urine red blood cells were recorded as less than 3 rbc/hpf (negative) or greater than or equal to 3 rbc/hpf (positive). IVPs were recorded as nonsevere or severe. IVP criteria were based on the presence or absence of extravasation, greater than 2-hour ureteral filling times, and a numerical scoring system of 1 to 4 for ureteral or calyceal dilatation and nephrogenic effect. Eighty-nine men (72%) had non-severe obstructions and 34 (28%) had severe obstructions. Twenty-five women (68%) had nonsevere obstructions and 12 (32%) had severe obstructions. Of the 28 patients with normal UAs, 11 had severe ureteral obstructions and 17 had nonsevere ureteral obstructions. There were no statistically significant differences between the presence or absence of significant microscopic hematuria and the presence or absence of severe ureteral obstruction. Microscopic hematuria is neither sensitive nor specific in determining the degree of calculus-related ureteral obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Overcrowding of emergency departments in New York City is the most apparent symptom of a crumbling health care system. There is a growing need for the care of a largely impoverished population suffering from an increasing prevalence of AIDS, substance abuse, and psychiatric disease. Institutions crippled by critical shortages of inpatient beds and nurses lack the resources to meet this rising demand. Although the epidemic of medical gridlock began in New York City, it is spreading rapidly to involve other areas of the country. Short-term efforts to resolve this crisis have thus far been unsuccessful. Long-range solutions are likely to be costly and may require a reconfiguration of societal health care priorities.\r"

Residents training in emergency medicine have a need for a defined curriculum in emergency medical services. Residency training should provide a basic foundation in EMS including on- and off-line medical control, medicolegal aspects, communications, disaster management, and EMS history, structure, and function. The resident must gain experience through on-scene observation, EMT/Paramedic education, medical direction, and quality assurance activities. This paper is one in a continuing series of goals and objectives to direct resident training in off-service rotations. Specific resources, learning objectives, and experiences are suggested.\r"

Tissue damage was evaluated by double-blind histopathologic examination: tissue edema was determined by measuring tissue water content. A total of 10 intermittent exposures to oxygen over a period of 4 days at 2 and 2.75 ATA did not influence the resolution of venom-induced tissue edema, whereas tissue damage was significantly ameliorated as compared to air-treated envenomated controls. HBOT also promoted healing in the venom-injected mice as evidenced by the presence of regenerating muscle cells. It is concluded that HBOT may limit rattlesnake venom-induced myonecrosis and promote healing in a dose-response relationship without reducing venom-induced edema.\r"

By examining rates of ETI in childhood SE after intravenous diazepam or lorazepam, when administered alone or in combination with phenytoin, the influence of anticonvulsants on the frequency of ETI during SE was determined. The medical records of 142 consecutive children younger than 16 years of age admitted from a university hospital ED with seizures during a 28-month period were retrospectively reviewed. SE was identified in 38 (27%) of cases. Records of children with SE were reviewed for demographic, seizure severity, and management variables. Twelve patients were excluded, ten of whom received concomitant phenobarbital. Patients receiving lorazepam had ETI rate of 27% (4/15), compared to 73% (8/11) in the diazepam group (P = 0.026, Fisher's exact). The groups were not significantly different in age, weight, sex, seizure type, seizure duration, and appropriate anticonvulsant dosage. A prospective, randomized trial comparing lorazepam and diazepam is warranted to confirm the apparent advantage of lorazepam in reducing respiratory depression.\r"

While paramedics have a strong fear of contracting AIDS, we note that they underestimate their risk of acquiring hepatitis B. Only 17% of paramedics surveyed had received the hepatitis vaccine, despite attending an infectious disease seminar addressing the occupational risks of acquiring hepatitis B infections during the previous year. Further educational efforts to address the paramedics' attitudes about AIDS, as well as to encourage paramedics to recognize hepatitis B exposure as a significant personal health risk, are currently being pursued.\r"

A very low level of expression was observed in monocultures of normal human fibroblasts or keratinocytes, but the expression was greatly stimulated when fibroblasts and keratinocytes were co-cultured. Primary skin explants under culture conditions supporting growth of both cell types, or mixed co-cultures of purified fibroblasts and keratinocytes, exhibited clearly enhanced synthesis of collagen VII, and the intact tissue form of this collagen could be extracted from small co-cultures. Three-dimensional skin equivalents were constructed with fibroblasts embedded in a contracted gel of collagen I and III, with an overlying stratified keratinocyte epithelium. In these equivalents, expression of collagen VII was observed primarily in the lowest epithelial cells, indicating that these cells are the main manufacturers of collagen VII. Laminin and collagen IV were deposited in a linear fashion onto the epithelial-mesenchymal interface. The results suggest that epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, either through physical interactions and/or through soluble mediators, are necessary for efficient synthesis of collagen VII and biogenesis of the anchoring fibrils.\r"

AntiId 3-17 is specific for an idiotype expressed on antiBMZ IgG in the serum of a patient with BP, and not expressed on pooled normal human IgG or IgG from patients with other autoimmune skin diseases. AntiId 3-17 binds to non-reduced, but not reduced, antiBMZ IgG on immunoblot, suggesting that the idiotype is composed of a conformational epitope expressed on native antibody. By a competitive inhibition ELISA, antiId 3-17 detects a cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) expressed in 18 of 50 (36%) of the sera of patients with BP, but in the sera of only 1 of 50 (2%) normal blood bank controls (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test) and 1 of 12 (8%) patients with pemphigus (p = 0.005).

  ".W": "Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) and its endemic form, Fogo Selvagem (FS), are characterized by subcorneal vesicles and pathogenic IgG autoantibodies directed against keratinocyte surface antigens. A major pool of FS antigen(s) remains bound to the insoluble epidermal envelope fraction. In this paper we demonstrate that this antigen(s) can be released from the envelope fraction by sonication. By immune precipitation four components can be detected, having molecular weights (MW) of 260, 80, 62, and 45 kD. The 260-kD component is lost by boiling or extraction with glycine HCl at pH 2.8. The major components appear to be the 80- and 62-kD poly-peptides. They chromatograph as a unit by gel filtration in 0.1% SDS, in the MW range of 115-120 kD. The FS antigen(s) appears to be cationic, forming insoluble complexes at low pH with SDS, and is labile to ammonium sulfate and freezing and thawing. It is unaffected by positive pressure concentration, 50% acetone precipitation, and reduction/alkylation. The FS antigen(s) is precipitated by all FS and nonendemic PF sera except those in complete clinical and serologic remission. The FS antigen(s) is also precipitated by 50% of pemphigus vulgaris but none of the bullous pemphigoid sera tested. All FS antigenic components are immunoprecipitated by IgG4 autoantibodies, but the IgG1 subclass from the same patients appear to immunoprecipitate only the 62-kD polypeptide. The FS antigen(s) is able to adsorb human autoantibodies against human desmoglein 1 (DG1), but not rabbit antisera against bovine DG1 or 2. This paper shows that physical stress, i.e., sonication, may be able to solubilize sufficient FS antigen(s) from the epidermal envelope fractions for further chemical characterization. The relationship of these FS antigen(s) to other reported FS antigens is presently unknown.\r"

Permeation of these compounds increased systematically with increasing NDMS concentration up to a limiting value for the permeability coefficient of about 0.1 cm/h. Permeability coefficients obtained with stripped skin indicated that, where NDMS has its maximal effect, the compounds diffuse through the skin as if there were no stratum corneum. Diffusion lag times of the test compounds through skin sections exposed to NDMS were far shorter than lag times in control experiments. The kinetics of NDMS action were assessed by pretreating skin sections for various periods of time with the enhancer and then assessing permeability. When applied as a 10 mM aqueous solution, the full effect of NDMS was obtained in 3 h of exposure and the effect lasted for at least 24 h. Treating the skin with ethanol/water (2:1) to elute NDMS after the pretreatment did not diminish its effect. Propranolol and phenyl propanolamine solubilized NDMS, presumably through the formation of mixed micelles, which had a profound effect on the permeation rates of both drug and enhancer.\r"

The present study focuses on the effects of TGF-beta 1 on expression of Ia antigen by Langerhans cells. Although TGF-beta 1, in concentrations from 0.001 to 100 micrograms/ml, has no effect on constitutive expression of Ia antigen on these cells, the in vitro up-regulation of Ia antigen on the surface of LC by interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, IL-3, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor is inhibited by the concomitant addition of 1 microgram/ml TGF-beta 1. In contrast, TGF-beta 1 has no effect on the up-regulation induced by IL-2 or IL-6. In this report, the activity of TGF-beta closely resembles that of Cyclosporine A (CsA). Similar results are seen in vivo when either TGF-beta 1 (5 micrograms, intraperitoneally [ip], daily on days 0-3) or CsA (1 mg, subcutaneously [sc], twice daily on days 0-3) are given together with IL-2 (500 U, intraperitoneally [ip], twice daily on days 1-3) or interferon-gamma (4,000 U, ip, twice daily on days 1-3). Given the important role of Ia expression in cell-mediated immune reactions, the effect of TGF-beta on contact sensitivity was next investigated. In doses of 5 micrograms, ip, daily on days 6-8, TGF-beta inhibits the expression of contact reactivity in animals sensitized on day 0 and challenged on day 7. In contrast, no effect is observed on the induction of contact sensitivity in mice given TGF-beta 1 on days--1 to 2, sensitized on day 0, and challenged on day 7. The possible importance of antagonism between TGF-beta and other cytokines, especially IFN-gamma, involved in the elicitation of contact hypersensitivity reactions is discussed.\r"

Cellular GSH exerts antioxidant effects and recent studies have suggested a role for oxygen radicals in the production of SBC. Hairless mice (Skh/h 1) received oral treatment with buthionine S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, to deplete cutaneous GSH; 4 d later their ears were exposed to UVB radiation. BSO treatment significantly reduced GSH levels in the epidermis to 10-15% of control levels. Twenty-four hours after UVB exposure, SBC counts in the ears of animals with and without BSO treatment were measured, and those exposed to UVB were found to have increased. Greater numbers of SBC were found in the ears of BSO-treated mice exposed to 15 or 20 mJ/cm2 UVB, than in non-BSO-treated mice exposed to the same UVB doses. At higher UVB doses, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. The results show that endogenous GSH provides the epidermis with measurable protection against injury by low or moderate UVB doses.\r"

  ".W": "Stratum corneum lipids have been found to be an important determinant involved in the water-holding function of the stratum corneum. In order to further elucidate the significance of stratum corneum lipids in the water-holding properties, the hydration behavior of the stratum corneum following depletion and replenishment of the lipids has been studied, using an isolated human forearm stratum corneum sheet, by differential scanning calorimetry parallel to ultrastructural changes of intercellular lipids in the stratum corneum. Extraction of the stratum corneum sheet with acetone/ether (1/1) decreased the bound-water content from 33.3% to 19.7%, where the melting temperature of ice remained constant. Further extraction with water, which released a large amount of water-soluble materials such as amino acids, did not change the bound-water content, but definitely raised the melting temperature of ice. The application of the stratum corneum lipids, which were solubilized in squalane containing 1% alpha-monomethyl heptadecyl glyceryl ether to the lipid-depleted stratum corneum sheet, caused a significant recovery of bound-water content to the previous, almost normal level. In accordance with the hydration behavior, electron microscopic analysis of the acetone/ether-treated stratum corneum sheet revealed selective depletion of lipids from the intercellular spaces, accompanied by a marked disruption of multiple lamellar structures. In contrast, the application of stratum corneum lipids into the lipid-depleted stratum corneum sheet resulted in the restoration of the lamellar structure between the stratum corneum cells. These findings strongly suggest that stratum corneum lipids serve a water-holding function through the formation of lamellar structures within the stratum corneum.\r"

  ".W": "gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (gamma-MSH)-like immunoreactivity has been found by indirect immunofluorescence in nerve fibers and terminals as well as in neutrophilic granulocytes of normal human skin. A preferential localization to sensory nerves was seen; abundant nerve fibers displaying gamma-MSH immunoreactivity were observed as free nerve endings in the basal layer of the epidermis and in the upper dermis, close to the Merkel cells, in Meissner's corpuscles, around the external root sheath of the lower part of the hair follicles, and in nerve bundles of the deeper parts of the dermis. Very few fibers were seen to be associated with sweat glands and most blood vessels, although arterioles were densely innervated. Thus, gamma-MSH should be considered for possible role as a sensory or axon-reflex chemical messenger. Furthermore, the presence of gamma-MSH in neutrophilic granulocytes raises the possibility that gamma-MSH may play a role in the genesis of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, nevi, and melanomas.\r"

To determine whether this event is associated with structural evidence of granule externalization, we studied the sequential evolution of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity in vivo, as well as mast cell degranulation provoked by a variety of stimuli in cultured explants of human skin. By 1 min after intradermal antigen challenge with ragweed extract, mast cell degranulation was associated with apparent extrusion of intragranule constituents into the pericellular connective tissue. Similar features typified cultured skin explants exposed for 45 min to anti-IgE and other mast cell secretagogues (morphine sulfate, calcium ionophore A23187, compound 48/80, and substance P). Once externalized, granule constituents could be identified within the dermal matrix by their rounded contour and structural similarity to solubilized granule matrices remaining within actively secreting cells. These data indicate that externalization of connective tissue mast cell granule contents occurs early after secretagogue exposure, potentially accounting for infrequent documentation of this event in naturally occurring dermatoses. The ability to recognize externalized granule products at a morphologic level should facilitate the understanding of interactions between mast cell-derived mediators and target structures of the dermal microvasculature.\r"

  ".W": "12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and its analogs were surveyed for their abilities to modify contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses in SENCAR mice. Sensitization of dorsal skin with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and subsequent challenge of the ear 5 d later resulted within 24 h in ear swelling and increased vascular permeability (as measured by the extravasation of Evans Blue dye). Treatment of dorsal or ventral skin with TPA 4 times (application made every 3 or 4 d) prior to sensitization on the dorsum inhibited subsequent induction of CHS by DNFB challenge. Maximum suppression of CHS required sensitization at the site of TPA treatment. Suppression occurred over a narrow dose range of TPA (0.1-1.0 micrograms), and qualitatively correlated with the tumor incidences scored in an initiation-promotion multistage skin carcinogenesis experiment. Multiple applications (4x) of the promoters phorbol-12,13-dibenzoate (10 micrograms) and mezerein (2 micrograms) also suppressed CHS, whereas the non-promoter phorbol (20 micrograms) and the first stage tumor promoter 4-O-methyl TPA (20 micrograms) had no effect. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes isolated from mice pre-treated with TPA prior to DNFB sensitization inhibited the development of CHS in recipient mice that were sensitized and challenged with DNFB, but not oxazolone. Splenocyte preparations depleted of T lymphocytes prior to transfer could not suppress CHS in recipient mice. Conversely, suppressive activity was concentrated in splenocyte preparations depleted of adherent cells/monocytes. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that TPA treatment of murine epidermis prior to sensitization with hapten can inhibit subsequent hapten-dependent elicitation of CHS. This suppression is mediated in part by antigen-specific suppressor T cells. Furthermore, there is a qualitative correlation between the complete and second stage in vivo tumor-promoting activities of TPA and its analogs, and their abilities to inhibit CHS.\r"

Topical application of CsA (1.7 mumol) to the dorsal skin irradiated with 50 mJ/cm2 UV-B did not remarkably change ODC activity. On the other hand, if CsA was applied simultaneously with 3 J/cm2 UV-A 1 h after treatment with 0.3% 8-methoxypsoralen, PUVA-induced ODC activity was suppressed by about 60% at 12 and 24 h after UV-A irradiation. In the dot blotting analysis of ODC-specific mRNA level, a significant but slight decrease in ODC mRNA level (about 20% inhibition) was observed in the PUVA-treated group compared with the control group (vehicle and UV-A). The inhibition of PUVA-induced ODC activity by CsA may have been caused in part by the decrease in ODC mRNA level and in part by a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism.\r"

In this study we have shown that the hair follicle exhibits aerobic glycolysis, in that of the total glucose utilized by the hair follicle, only 10% is oxidized to CO2. We have also shown that, in the absence of glucose, the hair follicle is capable of utilizing other fuels such as palmitate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. However, neither palmitate or beta-hydroxybutyrate had any effect on the rate of glucose utilization or on [U-14C] glucose oxidation, showing that glucose sparing via the glucose fatty acid cycle does not operate in the hair follicle. Measurements of glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway accounted for only 3% of the total glucose utilized by the hair follicle, although this value represented 32% of the total glucose oxidized. Both palmitate and beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine whether epidermal cells (EC) from psoriasis lesions and uninvolved skin could stimulate autologous T lymphocytes in the in vitro autologous mixed epidermal cell-T lymphocyte reaction (autologous MECLR). The functional role of antigen-presenting cell (APC) subsets was concurrently determined in this reaction. Mononuclear cells and purified T lymphocytes from peripheral blood of psoriasis patients showed a clear proliferative response to autologous unpurified epidermal cells from involved as well as uninvolved skin. The autologous mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) was not elevated in psoriasis patients. In healthy controls and contact allergy patients, T-lymphocyte proliferation was not observed either in the autologous MECLR or in the autologous MLR. The level of proliferation in the autologous MECLR from psoriasis patients correlated to the number of epidermal cells that were added. To exclude the possibility that the observed proliferation in the autologous MECLR in psoriasis was due to the presence of epidermal T lymphocytes that were being stimulated and expanded in vitro, the stimulator EC were gamma irradiated (30 Gy) in some experiments. Preincubation of EC with cyclosporin A (CsA) significantly inhibited the autologous MECLR. The CsA-induced inhibition could be neutralized by the addition of fresh untreated EC to these cultures. This indicated that one of the modes of action of CsA in resolving psoriasis is, as some investigators have already shown, via inhibition of epidermal accessory cell function. In the autologous MECLR, APC from psoriasis skin could initiate this reaction, whereas APC from peripheral blood could not. This occurred in an MHC class II restricted fashion. Depletion experiments showed that Langerhans cells (HLA-DR+/CD1a+) were not the principal stimulators of autologous T lymphocytes in the MECLR. These results indicated that mainly HLA-DR+/CD1a- epidermal cells from psoriasis patients could stimulate autologous peripheral blood T lymphocytes in an MHC class II-restricted fashion.\r"

Organ culture of full-thickness skin explants enables us to do so, because injury to the skin can be made in vitro, eliminating the rapid leakage of serum and infiltration of leukocytes that occur in vivo. In our studies, the military vesicant sulfur mustard (SM) (10 microliters of a 0.01 to 1.0% dilution) was topically applied to injure the epidermis of the explant. Then, the explants were cultured in small Petri dishes, usually for 18 h at 36 degrees C, and the organ-culture fluids were assayed for various inflammatory mediators. We found that the culture fluids from SM-exposed and control explants contained similar amounts of angiotensin-converting enzyme, trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases, acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, lysozyme, deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, interleukin 1, and lactic dehydrogenase. However, the culture fluids from SM-exposed explants contained increased amounts of histamine and plasminogen-activating activity, and often prostaglandin E2, when compared to culture fluids from control explants. After 3 to 4 d in culture, full-thickness human skin explants, when exposed to 0.2% SM (but not when exposed to 1.0% SM), sometimes showed separation of the epidermis and increased collagenase activity (i.e., hydroxyproline release). Thus, histamine (from local mast cells), and prostaglandin E2 and plasminogen-activating activity (probably from both mast cells and epidermal cells) are apparently involved in early mediation of the inflammatory response.\r"

In contrast to 248 nm, treatments with the 193-nm laser radiation below 70 J/m2 did not cause significant pyrimidine dimer formation in the skin cells. This was indicated by the lack of excision repair activities (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay), and further demonstrated by direct analysis of pyrimidine dimers in DNA from irradiated cells. However, a low level of unscheduled DNA synthesis could be detected following irradiation at 193 nm with 70 J/m2. Both the 193-nm and 248-nm radiation were able to induce chromosomal aberrations, as indicated by a micronucleus assay. A dose-dependent increase in micronuclei frequency was observed 48 and 72 h after laser irradiation. These results indicate that exposure of actively replicating human skin fibroblasts to sublethal doses of either 193- or 248-nm laser radiation can result in genotoxicity.\r"

Dimers were assayed in skin sections by immunofluorescence microscopy with a monoclonal antibody against the cyclobutyl thymine dimer. The dimer-specific fluorescence from epidermal cell nuclei, identified by counterstaining with propidium iodide, was quantified through computer-mediated image processing and analysis. After a single UV exposure (2-3 MED), significant dimer-specific fluorescence was measured, but no difference could be detected between skin kept in the dark after UV-irradiation and that exposed to visible light. In three other experiments, the UV dose was split into 3 parts (1 MED each), given at 2.5-h intervals. Half of the skin area was exposed to visible light following each dose fraction. After the second and third dose fractions, skin areas treated with visible light clearly showed lower levels of dimers (i.e., about 40% reduced) than skin kept in the dark. The results provide evidence that photorepair of dimers does occur in human skin, but not immediately after a first UV exposure of naive skin.\r"

The screen yielded five clones, the largest one, pcBPA-4, being 2.3 kb in size. The pcBPA-4 cDNA hybridized in Northern analyses with an approximately 9-kb mRNA from cultured keratinocytes, whereas no hybridization signal was detected with RNA from human skin fibroblast, fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells, or amniotic epithelial WISH cell cultures. Nucleotide sequencing of pcBPA-4 revealed an open reading frame encoding a putative polypeptide of 447 amino acids. This polypeptide showed 88% homology with corresponding mouse BP antigen sequences, and a region of it was identical to a segment in previously published human BP antigen sequences. The 2.3-kb cDNA isolated here was different from a previously published human BP antigen cDNA, in that the open reading frame coded for 264 additional amino acids at the carboxyl end of the putative polypeptide. Known human BP antigen amino acid sequences, compared with mouse sequences, were predicted to be moderately divergent with a unit of evolutionary period (UEP) of 4.5 millions of years (MY). Southern hybridizations suggested that the BP antigen gene (BPAG1) is present as a single copy in the human genome. Southern analyses also revealed the presence of a StuI restriction fragment length polymorphism that can be used for linkage analyses to study the inheritance of a particular BPAG1 allele and a heritable cutaneous disorder affecting the basement membrane zone, such as epidermolysis bullosa.\r"

Keratinocytes as well as melanocytes were derived from human foreskin, grown as a monolayer in petri dishes, covered with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% glucose, and irradiated. UV irradiation was carried out at 254, 297, and 302 nm as well as with a light source emitting predominantly 312 nm.

We found a slightly higher response for dimer induction in melanocytes at 254, 297, and 302 nm; this difference was only significant at the 297-nm wavelength. Action spectra for pyrimidine dimer induction were derived from the exposure-response data obtained. The action spectra mimic to a large degree the action spectra for dimer induction in other cultured mammalian cells. The repair rate during a post-irradiation period lasting up to 24 h was substantially the same for the two cell types. The percentage of T4 endonuclease V-sensitive sites (ESS) remaining 9 and 24 h after irradiation was 45% and 30%, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Flank organs of hamster are useful for studying androgen-dependent growth of hair follicles and sebaceous glands. To elucidate the mechanism of gene expression regulated by androgen, we constructed a cDNA library from flank organs of male hamsters and screened by a differential hybridization method using cDNA probes from normal and castrated males. We isolated a cDNA clone, termed FAR-17a, whose expression was found to be highly sensitive to androgen. FAR-17a mRNA of 1.8 kb was reduced after castration and reappeared after testosterone treatments. Among several tissues examined, FAR-17a gene was expressed at a high level in flank organ and a low level in testis and earlobe. FAR-17a probe detected a few fragments in genomic DNA of hamster, mouse, suncus, pig, and human, suggesting that this gene is phylogenetically conserved. The sequence of FAR-17a cDNA predicts a protein of 231 amino acids (27,216 daltons) having basic properties. The deduced protein has no significant homologies to proteins previously described.\r"

As epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) are bone-marrow-derived cells, we were interested to see whether they are altered in patients with MDS. Epidermal sheets were prepared from biopsies taken from the thighs of nine patients with MDS and five control persons and processed for immunoperoxidase staining of CD1a antigens. The density and morphology of CD1a+ cells (i.e., LC) was evaluated by visual assessment as well as automatic image analysis. The density of LC was reduced in seven of nine patients (range, 30-75% of normal), whereas the morphology of LC appeared to be altered in all MDS patients in that the LC displayed large and bizarre cell bodies with only a few and often abnormally long dendrites. The HLA-DR expression by LC was not altered, as shown by double immunofluorescence staining of CD1a and HLA-DR antigens. Ultrastructurally, LC again appeared enlarged and often presented with bizarre nuclei, yet displayed no other abnormalities. Our findings suggest that LC are abnormal in MDS and might even indicate a more wide-spread involvement of the dendritic cell lineage in this syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "91258878\r", 
  ".W": "8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP)-DNA photoadducts were quantified in freshly isolated human and murine keratinocytes and cultured keratinocyte cell lines after in vitro treatment with 8-MOP (1-200 ng/ml) and ultraviolet A (UVA; 0.2-24.0 J/cm2). Greater doses of 8-MOP and UVA led to proportionately greater numbers of photoadducts, with a dose reciprocity relationship between the amounts of 8-MOP and UVA. No significant difference in photoadduct formation was observed between basal and differentiated cells. However, the transformed keratinocyte cell lines showed fewer photoadducts than did normal keratinocytes, which appeared to be correlated with the finding that the adduct formation was inhibited in normal keratinocytes cultured with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, because this agent leads to epidermal hyperproliferation. In viable keratinocytes that were treated with a sublethal dose of 8-MOP and UVA (15 ng/ml and 1 J/cm2, respectively), 54% of photoadducts formed were removed over a 20-h period. Adduct removal depended on the calcium concentration in the media; cells cultured in standard high calcium levels showed a higher removal rate than those cultured in low-calcium media. The addition of retinoids (etretinate, acitretin, and 13-cis retinoic acid) to the culture induced 55 to 80% of suppression of the adduct removal. The calcium ionophore A23187 partially restored the suppression of photoadduct removal induced by retinoids. The present studies suggest that calcium performs an important role in the photoadduct removal and raise the possibility that the synergism of systemic retinoids and psoralen plus UVA photochemotherapy relates to the former's inhibition of repair of 8-MOP photoadducts in DNA.\r"

  ".U": "91258879\r", 
  ".W": "Essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) is a useful model for studying the role of (n-6) fatty acid metabolism in normal physiology. Because cutaneous manifestations are among the earliest signs of EFAD and because abnormalities in the distribution and function of tissue macrophages have been documented in EFAD rodents, we studied the distribution and function of Class II MHC (Ia) antigen-bearing cells in EFAD C57B1/6 mouse epidermis. Immunofluorescence studies revealed 1.9-9.6 (mean +/- SEM = 5.2 +/- 2.6) times more class II MHC (Ia) antigen-bearing epidermal cells in suspensions prepared from EFAD as compared to normal skin. Analysis of epidermal sheets demonstrated similar numbers of dendritic Ia+ and NLDC145+ cells in EFAD and normal epidermis, however. This discrepancy occurred because some keratinocytes in EFAD epidermal sheets expressed class II MHC (Ia) antigens, whereas keratinocytes in normal mouse epidermis did not. Two-color flow cytometry confirmed that all Ia+ cells in normal epidermis are Langerhans (Ia+ NLDC145+) cells, whereas Ia+ cells in EFAD epidermis are comprised of Langerhans cells and a subpopulation of keratinocytes (Ia+ NLDC145-). Similar levels of Ia antigens were expressed on EFAD and normal Langerhans cells. EFAD and normal epidermal cells were also compared in several in vitro assays of accessory cell function. Epidermal cells prepared from EFAD C57B1/6 mice present the protein antigen DNP-Ova to primed helper T cells more effectively than epidermal cells prepared from normal animals. EFAD epidermal cells are also more potent stimulators of T cells in primary and secondary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte-epidermal cell reactions than normal epidermal cells. The functional differences between EFAD and normal epidermal cells do not appear to result from increased cytokine release or decreased prostaglandin production by EFAD epidermal cells. In view of these findings and the observation that the antigen-presenting cell activity of EFAD epidermal cells correlates with the number of Ia+ keratinocytes in epidermal cell preparations, Ia+ keratinocytes (in the presence of Langerhans cells) may potentiate cutaneous immune responses in vitro and perhaps in vivo as well. These results also suggest that (n-6) fatty acids or metabolites of (n-6) fatty acids are involved in regulating the expression of class II MHC (Ia) antigens by keratinocytes in vivo.\r"

Hairless guinea pigs were pretreated in vivo for 24 h with either 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) to induce irritant contact dermatitis or with water (controls). Twenty-four hours after pretreatment animals were sacrificed. Percutaneous penetration was then measured using in vitro diffusion cells and the removed (pretreated) skin. The following parameters were determined: cumulative amount of compound penetrated, steady state flux, lag time, and permeability coefficient, skin concentration per unit area, and the relative amount of drug remaining in the skin (as a percentage of the cumulative amount of compound penetrated through the skin). SLS pretreatment resulted in moderate irritant dermatitis in all animals and increased in vivo transepidermal water loss 4.5 times. Flux was increased in SLS-pretreated skin as compared with controls for all four compounds, with the greatest enhancement for hydrocortisone (HC) (5.9 times), followed by indomethacin (IM) (4.6 times), ibuprofen (IB) (3.9 times), and acitretin (AC) (3.4 times). Skin concentrations increased to a smaller degree from 1.6 times (IB) and 2.6 times (HC) to 3.4 times (IM). However, AC skin concentrations were not different between the two groups. Thus, percutaneous penetration parameters were equivocally influenced by SLS-induced irritation. Increased skin concentrations were paralleled by even higher increases in flux.\r"

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of RA treatment on collagen synthesis using biochemical and immunochemical techniques. Albino hairless mice were irradiated three times a week for 10 weeks with four minimal erythema doses of UVB from Westinghouse FS-40 bulbs. In the post-UV period, mice were either nontreated or treated with 0.05% RA or the ethanol-propylene glycol vehicle for up to 10 weeks. Antibodies against the aminopropeptide (AP) of type III procollagen were used in immunofluorescence microscopy and radioimmunoassay techniques. The AP of type III collagen is normally present throughout the dermis and in areas of active collagen synthesis (i.e., the dermal-epidermal junction). In this study, a similar distribution was seen in all untreated and vehicle-treated mice, and in mice treated with RA for 2, 4, and 6 weeks. However, increased staining, in a subepidermal band, was detected in the 8-week RA-treated skin. This region became intensely fluorescent to a depth of 100 mu in the 10-week RA-treated skins. As determined by radioimmunoassay, the content of the AP of type III procollagen increased twofold with 10-week RA treatment. Because the ratio of type I to type III collagens remained constant in treated and untreated skins, it is reasonable to assume that the content of type I collagen increased in proportion to type III collagen in RA-treated skins.\r"

Within resident epidermal cells (EC), LC are the only cells expressing the CD4 antigen and are, therefore, a possible target for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To date, conflicting results have been reported on the in vivo infection of LC by HIV. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of HIV-1 proviral DNA in epidermal LC of HIV-1-infected patients. EC suspensions were prepared from clinically normal skin of nine seropositive patients. Purified LC and LC-depleted EC were obtained by immunomagnetic separation and analyzed for the presence of HIV-1 proviral DNA by the polymerase chain reaction using primer pairs from different conserved regions (env and gag) of the HIV-1 genome. HIV-1 proviral DNA was detected in LC from seven of nine patients. LC-depleted EC fractions from the same nine patients were all negative, with the exception of one case. Altogether these results demonstrate that epidermal LC are infected by HIV-1 and constitute the only resident cell type in the epidermis harboring the virus. Further studies are, however, needed to demonstrate HIV replication in LC and to elucidate the functional role of LC in this infection.\r"

PDGF receptors were expressed at low levels in normal skin, with only occasional staining of dermal connective tissue cells. In contrast, PDGF receptor expression was greatly elevated in the dermis of growth-activated skin from 15 chronic wounds and 10 psoriatic lesions. PDGF receptors were increased in dermal fibroblasts and in dermal blood vessels in both conditions. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the increased expression of beta-subtype PDGF receptors in psoriatic lesional tissue. PDGF receptors were not detected in normal or growth-activated epidermis. Differential expression of PDGF receptors could regulate increased proliferation of vascular and connective tissue cells observed in psoriasis and chronic wounds.\r"

Structure/activity studies on tigliane class phorbol compounds, which lack an oxygen at the 12 position, have shown that tumor-promoting activity can be diminished or abolished though retaining other biologic activities of phorbol compounds, including the ability to activate PKC. In this study, two tigliane class phorbol derivates [12 deoxyphorbol, 13 isobutyrate (DPIB) and 12 deoxyphorbol, 13 phenylacetate (DPPA)] were studied for their ability to stimulate melanocyte proliferation in a serum-free culture system based on MCDB 153 medium. Compared to the activity of phorbol 12-O-myristate, 13 acetate (PMA), a widely used tumor-promoting phorbol derivative, DPIB and DPPA were effective mitogens for human melanocytes. The importance of PKC activation in mitogenic modulation of human melanocytes is further supported by the stereospecific mitogenic activity of (-)Indolactam V, a PKC-activating compound structurally unrelated to phorbols. The use of the tigliane type phorbols DPIB and DPPA to stimulate growth of human melanocytes may provide safer compounds for laboratory or patient studies and may also provide further insights into the role of PKC activation in human melanocyte biology.\r"

However, the possible contribution of these compounds to lung inflammation in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) has yet to be reported. We performed 11 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) studies in six patients with HP and compared the results with results from studies in 21 healthy normal volunteers. In patients with HP, spontaneous and stimulated measures of ROS metabolism by air space cells were significantly higher than those seen in normal volunteers. When alveolar macrophages were purified by depleting neutrophils and eosinophils on density gradients of Percoll (specific gravity 1.075 gm/ml), ROS metabolism remained elevated when compared with that in cells obtained from healthy controls, confirming that alveolar macrophage ROS metabolism is enhanced in patients with HP. Further, we found significant elevations in BAL total protein, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils in patients with HP when they were compared with normal volunteers, with an increased proportion of BAL T lymphocytes expressing CD8 and natural killer surface antigens, consistent with previous work. Lavage samples from patients with HP with clinically active disease had higher proportions of BAL eosinophils and concentrations of total protein, lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second, lower forced vital capacity, and lower arterial oxygen tensions, and higher indices of ROS metabolism than samples from patients with HP with inactive disease. HP is associated with evidence of air space inflammation, to which alveolar macrophage-derived ROS may contribute.\r"

  ".W": "Serum proteins act as weak acids and participate in acid-base balance. Their effects are imprecisely quantified; in particular, the roles of albumin and globulins need reevaluation. We approached the problem in three steps. First, in artificial solutions resembling serum but with human serum albumin as the only protein moiety, we varied the strong ion difference (SID), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco2) and the concentration of albumin [( Alb]) and fixed the concentration of inorganic phosphate [( Pi]). We measured pH and derived the charges on albumin. Second, extending the work of Stewart (Stewart PA. How to understand acid-base. A quantitative acid-base primer for biology and medicine. New York: Elsevier, 1981:1-286), we developed a mathematical model that solves for pH and for the charges on albumin as functions of SID, Pco2, [Pi], and [Alb]. The calculated values fit the observed values well; that is, the model describes well the behavior of these solutions over a wide range of simulated complex acid-base disturbances. Finally, in human serum samples containing both albumin and globulins, we varied SID, Pco2, and total protein concentration [( TP]); we fixed [Pi] and then measured pH and derived the charges on proteins as above. When we applied to these data the computer model developed for albumin alone, the calculated pH and derived charges on albumin values agreed well with the observed pH and derived charges on proteins. We conclude first that human serum globulins play a negligible role in acid-base equilibria, and second, that in normal human serum at pH 7.40 with [TP] = 7 and [Alb] = 4.3 gm/dl, the charges attributed to proteins are approximately 12 mEq/L; this is substantially less than the value of approximately 17 mEq/L given by many contemporary texts, based on work of van Slyke et al. (van Slyke DD, Hastings AB, Hiller A, Sendroy J Jr. Studies of gas and electrolyte equilibria in blood. XIV. Amounts of alkali bound by serum albumin and globulin. J Biol Chem 1928;79:769-80). These findings should be considered when evaluating acid-base balance in patients with abnormal serum albumin concentration, for example, when interpreting values of the anion gap.\r"

  ".W": "Although efficacy and toxicity of primaquine (PQ) depend on bioconversion, the process is poorly understood, even for carboxyprimaquine (CPQ), the major plasma metabolite. Earlier work to clarify drug metabolism showed that PQ could be converted quantitatively into CPQ, in vitro, with human erythroleukemic K562 cells or nonleukemic bone marrow supplemented with calf serum. We have now found--using systems with serum only, as well as with K562, bone marrow, and adult or embryonic liver cells--that the bioconversion of the side chain of PQ involves a branched pathway with at least three separate enzymes and two derivatives other than CPQ. An oxidase activity in serum converted PQ first into a novel side chain aldehyde (Y). Aldehyde dehydrogenase transformed PQ-aldehyde into CPQ in cell-free systems and in K562, bone marrow, and adult liver cells. Embryonic hepatocytes or bone marrow treated with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea did not produce CPQ; instead, they made a metabolite (Xc) that we could synthetize via PQ-aldehyde and identify as PQ-alcohol. PQ-alcohol replaced CPQ as the final product whenever alcohol-dehydrogenase prevailed over aldehyde dehydrogenase. These enzymes operated in intact cells and controlled the biotransformation of PQ absolutely. Unless both dehydrogenase were absent, inhibited, or deprived of coenzyme, potentially cytotoxic PQ-aldehyde intermediate did not accumulate. Some of the unique tissues schizonticidal and gametocidal effects of PQ may depend on the distribution pattern and relative activities of PQ oxidase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase in human subjects and in parasites.\r"

  ".U": "91258955\r", 
  ".W": "A fundamental difficulty in the study of red cell senescence has been that of isolating a population of cells that have been aged in vivo. It has been proposed that the induction of Heinz body formation through the use of oxidizing agents, including phenylhydrazine, can provide a model for elucidating mechanisms of normal red cell aging. In an effort to evaluate the applicability of this model, we examined the nature of autologous antibody binding to phenylhydrazine-treated cells. Using both radioisotopic and immunofluorescent probes, we confirmed the previous observation of increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding to phenylhydrazine-treated cells. However, further analysis of the cell population indicated that the majority of the IgG bound to cells that had suffered severe membrane lesions, allowing access to intracellular consituents. Elution and analysis of the bound autologous IgG confirmed that it showed specificity for some of these intracellular constituents as well as for the surface epitopes available on intact cells. We conclude that phenylhydrazine treatment is a problematic model for study of red blood cell aging mechanisms, because the binding of autologous IgG appears to be limited to a small population of severely damaged cells.\r"

  ".W": "Dipyridamole (Persantin), a commonly used coronary vasodilator and antithrombotic drug, has been intensively studied for its potential use in combination chemotherapy for cancer, and, recently, for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. However, the strong binding of dipyridamole to proteins in human plasma complicates quantitative extrapolations from in vitro data to the clinic. To aid in such extrapolations, we incubated dipyridamole in human plasma and in tissue culture media containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and determined the equilibrium levels of free drug. In human plasma, after addition of 2 to 10 mumol/L dipyridamole (i.e., in the therapeutically relevant concentration range), the fraction of free drug averaged between 1.9% and 3.5%. In 10% FCS, after addition of 0.08 to 5 mumol/L dipyridamole (i.e., the experimentally relevant concentration range), mean free fractions were in the 75% to 100% range. Relating various total dipyridamole levels in the therapeutically relevant range in human plasma to those in 10% FCS that provided identical fractions of free drug gave ratios in the 24 to 55 range. Thus, a multiplication factor in the above range is suggested for the interconversion of in vitro and in vivo dipyridamole concentrations that provide equivalent levels of free drug.\r"

  ".W": "Iron, by catalyzing the generation of the hydroxyl radical via the Haber-Weiss reaction, may participate in oxidant tissue injury. To determine whether iron might contribute to cigarette smoke-induced lung injury, we estimated the iron content of the lower respiratory tract by measuring intracellular iron content of pulmonary macrophages and extracellular iron content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by using methods that allow for recovery of samples enriched for bronchial and alveolar contents. The intracellular iron content of the alveolar macrophages was determined by staining cytocentrifuged, air-dried pulmonary macrophages with a modified Prussian blue stain and assigning a score of 0 to 3 (0 = no stain, 3 = dense staining throughout the cytoplasm) to 100 macrophages. The extracellular iron level of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined by using modifications of the Ferrozine method of Carter. Macrophage intracellular iron content was measured in a group of cigarette smokers with chronic bronchitis (n = 17), in smokers without chronic bronchitis (n = 15), and in normal volunteers (n = 15). Extracellular iron concentration was determined in a subset of the subjects with chronic bronchitis (n = 12) and in a separate group of normal volunteers (n = 5). The intracellular iron score was elevated in the bronchial sample lavage fluid in both the smokers with chronic bronchitis (45.3 +/- 13.9) and the asymptomatic smokers (26.6 +/- 8.0) compared with the normal individuals (8.1 +/- 1.7, p less than 0.03, both comparisons), but did not differ between the two groups of cigarette-smoking subjects (p = 0.68).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There is considerable evidence that blood viscosity is greater than normal in diabetes, and decreased red blood cell deformability has been suggested as the cause. However, viscosity can be influenced by changes in the properties of blood proteins in addition to red cells. Direct interpretation of red cell filtrometry data in terms of deformability has been complicated by the interfering effect of white cells and platelets and clogging of micropores. We have thus used the cell transit time analyzer, a new filtrometric procedure that eliminates these complications and produces an individual red cell micropore transit time profile, to reassess diabetic red cell deformability. Samples from 26 patients with diabetes and an equal number of subjects without diabetes who served as controls were assayed by the cell transit time analyzer at 2 and at 4 cm hydrostatic pressure. Samples from patients with diabetes and controls were sex and age matched for daily runs. At 2 cm H2O, red blood cell transit time for the patients with diabetes was 2.73 +/- 0.05 milliseconds as compared with 2.67 +/- 0.05 milliseconds for controls (p not significant). The ratio of transit time for patients with diabetes to that of controls (Td/Tnd) was 1.03 +/- 0.01 (p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon) at 2 cm H2O and 1.02 +/- 0.01 (p not significant) at 4 cm H2O.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Reactive oxygen species, including superoxide anion, have attracted increasing attention for their possible role in promoting inflammation in a variety of pulmonary diseases including asthma. However, reactive oxygen species metabolism of phagocytic cells may be substantially modified by therapeutic agents used for asthma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and alveolar macrophages from 15 normal subjects, and blood mononuclear cells from an additional 17 normal subjects, were studied to assess the effects of beta-receptor agonists and theophylline on phagocytic cell superoxide release. Isoproterenol produced a biphasic effect on spontaneous and phorbol ester stimulated alveolar macrophage and mononuclear cell superoxide production, augmenting release at 10(-5)M, and inhibiting release at 10(-4)M. These effects on spontaneous function in mononuclear cells were inhibited by 10(-5)M propranolol. Under conditions of phorbol ester-stimulation the enhancing effect of 10(-5)M isoproterenol on blood mononuclear cells was blocked by propranolol, but the inhibitory effect of 10(-4)M isoproterenol was not. Albuterol at equimolar concentrations with isoproterenol was not associated with altered spontaneous or stimulated superoxide release by alveolar macrophages or mononuclear cells. Further, spontaneous superoxide release by alveolar macrophages and mononuclear cells was significantly reduced by therapeutically achievable concentrations of theophylline (greater than 5 micrograms/ml). We conclude that the medication history must be controlled in studies of cell function in asthma, and that albuterol may be preferable to isoproterenol as a premedication for bronchoscopy when superoxide production of airspace cells is studied.\r"

Collagen types III, IV, and V did not appear to activate Hageman factor under the conditions tested. To the contrary, these collagen species inhibited activation of Hageman factor by glass or ellagic acid. These studies suggest that some types of collagen may play an inhibitory role in blood coagulation.\r"

There were significant reductions in recurrent non-fatal and fatal CHD, with a downward trend in total mortality. Mechanisms underlying the relationship between cholesterol lowering and secondary prevention are reviewed. The implication of this analysis of trials for clinical practice is that hypercholesterolaemia should be sought and effectively treated in patients with CHD, unless contraindications are present.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in diabetic patients is unknown, since no noninvasive and valid screening procedures are available. We have therefore evaluated 5194 consecutive autopsy protocols from patients who died between 1980 and 1988. In addition, all available clinical records for patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) and a random sample were evaluated. It was found that 73% of patients with RAS were hypertensive, and 53% had diabetes, all but one being Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent). Renal artery stenosis was present in 225 (4.3%) of all patients [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.8-4.9], and was not reported in the patients' clinical records in 93% of cases. RAS was present in 8.3% of all diabetic patients (95% CI, 6.8-9.8%), the odds ratio being 3.5 (95% CI, 2.6-4.6). The frequency of renal artery stenosis in diabetic patients with hypertension was 10.1%. Bilateral renal artery stenosis was found in 43% of patients with RAS and diabetes, and in 30% of non-diabetic patients with RAS (P = 0.059). Our results indicate that renal artery stenosis often goes undetected before autopsy. The presence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus increases the risk of renal artery stenosis. The risk of bilateral renal artery stenosis is greater in diabetic patients. These results may be of significance with regard to the diagnostic evaluation and choice of antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients.\r"

The positive predictive values for a risk intake of 30 g d-1 in men increased from 0.49 to 0.88, with increasing values for gamma-glutamyltransferase activity and increasing frequency of alcohol intake. The corresponding values for a risk intake of 40 g d-1 were 0.34-0.75. In women, increasing gamma-glutamyltransferase activity gave no increase in positive predictive values.

Twenty-two consecutive male patients with TIA and 18 patients with minor strokes from the carotid artery territory were examined by perimetry, cerebral computerised tomography and regional cerebral blood flow. Asymptomatic visual field defects were found in many TIA and minor stroke patients, 29% (5/17) and 57% (8/14), respectively (NS). Eighty-five per cent (11/13) of the scotomas were solely or predominantly located in the upper part of the visual field (P = 0.008 for absolute defects and P = 0.03 for relative defects). We conclude that both carotid territory TIA and minor stroke patients have a high frequency of asymptomatic visual field defects, predominantly located in the upper part of the visual field.\r"

Fractional shortening and the maximal velocity of cirumferential fibre shortening did not differ significantly between the two groups. Furthermore, no differences were found in the diastolic functional parameter of velocity of circumferential fibre extension. Posterior wall thickness was significantly increased in the diabetic patients compared to the controls (9.5 +/- 1.8 mm vs. 8.4 +/- 1.3 mm. P less than 0.01). As the thickness of the interventricular septum was also moderately increased (9.2 +/- 2.2 mm vs. 8.9 +/- 1.7 mm, NS), these findings provide evidence for an early structural change of the myocardium in young diabetic patients without clinically relevant functional consequences.\r"

Antihypertensive drugs were gradually discontinued. Felodipine Er, 10 mg, was given once daily for 2 weeks, and after another wash-out period of 1 week, patients were switched to 25 mg HCTZ, once daily, and vice versa. Whole blood viscosity (BV) at three different shear stresses, haematocrit (Hct), plasma viscosity (PV), red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, RBC deformability, and fibrinogen were measured under standardized conditions 2.5 h after medication, and after 2 week of treatment (24 h post-dosing). Felodipine ER improved BV acutely, but not during treatment over a 2-week period. By contrast, HCTZ did not affect BV, but decreased RBC deformability 2.5 h after medication intake. After 2 weeks of treatment, the negative effect on RBC deformability had increased slightly. Furthermore, fibrinogen and PV were significantly elevated at this stage. In summary, felodipine ER did not improve blood rheology over a 2-week treatment period in this study. HCTZ exhibited marginal but significant negative effects on fibrinogen, PV and indices of RBC deformability, but not on RBC aggregation.\r"

Neurogenic inflammation (vasodilatation and neurogenic plasma extravasation) is one explanation for the development of headaches and the blood flow changes which occur during migraine headache. Numerous studies have recently been carried out on rats and guinea-pigs into the effects of antimigraine agents, including ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), on neurogenic plasma protein extravasation in the dura mater induced by electrical stimulation of trigeminal ganglia or systemic administration of capsaicin. It is known that the dura mater is able to produce headaches in man. Ergot alkaloids have been shown to block neurogenic inflammation via a C-fibre dependent neuronal mechanism. Sumatriptan appears to act fairly similarly although, whereas the ergot alkaloids are non-selective for either 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) receptors or 5-HT1, sumatriptan is selective for 5-HT1 receptors. The antimigraine action of NSAIDs may be via either an effect on blood vessels or an effect on the nerve fibre. The antimigraine effects of ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan and NSAIDs are discussed in the light of the common vasoconstrictor actions of these agents and knowledge that vasodilatation is apparently not responsible for migraine headache pain in most cases.\r"

  ".W": "Theories of migraine pathophysiology have evolved from the realms of the supernatural into the scientific arena but their further evolution seems delayed by unproductive controversy about whether or not migraine is primarily a vascular or a neurological dysfunction. This conceptual deadlock needs to be transcended by thinking beyond the neural and vascular systems, and by identifying mechanisms that could affect both to produce the characteristic clinical phenomena of migraine. One theoretical model envisages 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT) as a link between the neural and vascular systems, with global alteration of serotonergic neurotransmission affecting not only these systems, but the gastrointestinal tract as well, with incidental reverberations on platelet function. Such altered serotonergic transmission might originate from altered 5-HT receptor dynamics, a molecular change in turn produced by genetic mechanisms. Recognition of the importance of 5-HT receptor function in migraine, most notably that agonists of 5-HT1 receptors abort acute migraine and that antagonists of 5-HT2 receptors prevent migraine, may lead to significant therapeutic advances. The possibility that the \"trigeminovascular system\" might be the end-stage mechanism that these serotonergic changes detonate to produce the painful reverberations of migraine headache is also important. Seeking ways to muffle these reverberations, or to insulate the system itself from the action of external influences (likely through further study of peptidergic transmission and receptors) might result in more drugs that will abort or prevent migraine.\r"

(b) Symptomatic treatment of individual attacks. This includes various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin and paracetamol, and ergotamine, dihydroergotamine and phenothiazines. Morphinomimetics, which are often given for migraine, should really be avoided. (c) Prophylactic treatment which is particularly recommended for patients averaging two or more severe migraine attacks per month. Useful drugs include: beta-adrenergic receptor blockers as first choice, e.g. propranolol, timolol, nadolol and metoprolol; 5-hydroxytryptamine blockers, e.g. pizotifen and methysergide; calcium channel blockers; dihydroergotamine; and NSAIDs. (d) Non-drug treatment which is best combined with identification and elimination of trigger factors, and the use of various relaxation techniques. These four treatment types are covered in some detail, however it is clear that none of them is ideal and side-effects present a problem. Clearly, the continued research and development of novel and specific drugs for migraine is vital.\r"

  ".W": "The drugs used in migraine therapy can be divided into two groups: agents that abort an established migraine attack and agents used prophylactically to reduce the number of migraine attacks. Both groups have drugs that are specific for migrainous headaches and that are non-specific, and are used to treat the accompanying headache (analgesics), vomiting (anti-emetics), anxiety (sedatives and anxiolytics), or depression (antidepressants). The main drugs with specific action on migraine include ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine), agonists (sumatriptan) or partial agonists (methysergide) at a specific subtype of 5-HT1-like receptors, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol, metoprolol), calcium antagonists (flunarizine) and anti-inflammatory agents (indomethacin). The pharmacological basis of therapeutic action of several of these drugs is not well understood. In the case of the ergot alkaloids and 5-HT1-like receptor agonists, however, it is likely that the antimigraine effect is related to the potent and rather selective constriction of the large arteries and arteriovenous anastomoses in the scalp and dural regions. In addition, these drugs inhibit plasma extravasation into the dura in response to trigeminal ganglion stimulation, but it is possible that this effect is related to the selective vasoconstriction in the extracerebral vascular bed. The selectivity of the pharmacological effects of these antimigraine drugs (constriction of the extracerebral arteries and arteriovenous anastomoses, poor penetration into the central nervous system and the absence of an antinociceptive effect even after intrathecal administration) strongly suggests that excessive dilatation in the extracerebral cranial vasculature, probably initiated by a neuronal event, is an integral part of the pathophysiology of migraine.\r"

  ".W": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) has long been implicated in the aetiology of migraine but the evidence remains circumstantial and certainly not definitive. Numerous papers have reviewed the background which is briefly outlined here. Although the continued belief in the primary involvement of 5-HT in the genesis of a migraine attack has recently been questioned, many antimigraine drugs undeniably interact potently with 5-HT receptors. It can be argued, however, that their modest clinical benefit results from their pharmacological effects, be they mediated through 5-HT receptors or otherwise, independently of any pathophysiological involvement of endogenous 5-HT. Nevertheless, there seems convincing evidence that central release of 5-HT by various drug mechanisms causes migraine-like headache in migraineurs. It remains to be seen whether these drugs mimic the pathological event initiating the spontaneous migraine attack. Regardless of these considerations, the focus of research on 5-HT and migraine has proved to be enormously profitable over several decades, culminating recently in the identification of a novel, potentially important, antimigraine drug for the treatment of the acute attack. This drug, sumatriptan, is a selective cranial vasoconstrictor which mediates this effect by specifically activating a particular 5-HT1 receptor subtype. Undoubtedly a precise understanding of its clinical mechanism of action, which is currently being studied by a number of groups, will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of migraine. Perhaps this in turn will help in finally determining whether migraine is a vascular disease and whether or not a disturbance of 5-HT is just epiphenomenal or is truly the primary initiating pathological event.\r"

Pizotifen is the most widely used 5-HT2 receptor antagonist in migraine prophylaxis, because of its superior efficacy compared with cyproheptadine, and because the incidence and severity of adverse effects with pizotifen is lower compared with methysergide and mianserin. These agents have additional antagonistic effects at histamine H1, muscarinic cholinergic, alpha 1-adrenergic, alpha 2-adrenergic and dopamine receptors, but drugs which are selective for these non-5-HT receptors appear to be of no benefit in migraine. Actions mediated by 5-HT2 receptors which could be of relevance to migraine comprise cranial vasoconstriction, increased cranial capillary permeability and platelet aggregation, and some central nervous system effects and neuroendocrine functions. Although pizotifen, cyproheptadine and mianserin are considered to be relatively specific for 5-HT2 receptors, these agents and methysergide all share a high affinity for 5-HT1C binding sites; ketanserin, however, has little affinity for these sites, thus activation of 5-HT1C receptors may be an important step in the pathogenesis of migraine. It is not yet known which 5-HT1C receptor-mediated actions of 5-HT are relevant to migraine, but some behavioural actions and cranial vasodilatation via release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor may be involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They are located in pain- and nausea-modulating areas in the central nervous system and on C-fibre primary afferents in the peripheral nervous system. Consequently, these receptors mediate the painful and emetic effects of 5-HT. Selective and potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been shown to block inflammatory and 5-HT induced and potentiated \"vascular pain\". Based on the hypothesis that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may block neurogenic dural inflammation in the distribution area of the trigeminal nerve and, thus, could potentially prevent migraine (pain), four highly selective and potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been tested in both the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine. Unfortunately, except for a clear anti-emetic effect, none of these drugs has shown unequivocal efficacy in the treatment of migraine. This may be partly due to the complex (bell-shaped) dose-response relationship of these compounds, making exact titration of the correct dose difficult. Moreover, most 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have proved to be toxic in man on chronic administration thereby preventing further trials in migraine with adjusted doses. Short-term treatment for cytotoxic drug-induced emesis so far appears to be the only proven indication for 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.\r"

Sumatriptan is a highly selective 5-HT1-like receptor agonist which selectively constricts cranial blood vessels (including those in the dura mater). It also inhibits neurogenically-mediated plasma protein extravasation in the dura mater. Haemodynamic studies in anaesthetized animals have shown that sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arterial circulation and this effect appears to be restricted to an effect on carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. Sumatriptan has a much more selective pharmacological profile than ergot preparations which are also used in the acute treatment of migraine. The development of sumatriptan has been based on a vascular theory of migraine and its high degree of efficacy in the treatment of migraine strengthens the argument that dilatation of cranial blood vessels is the cause of vascular headache.\r"

If migraine is complicated by an additional headache, the analysis becomes more difficult, but the diagnosis still has to be accurate. This, however, is not always possible at the initial interview. A successful consultation should be more than just diagnostic; it is the beginning of treatment.\r"

A total of 1130 patients were recruited from 51 centres in eight countries and the efficacy results are presented from an interim analysis of 538 cases. Tolerability was evaluated in 227 patients. At 2 h, an improvement in headache severity from moderate or severe to mild or none was reported by 67% of patients who received 100 mg sumatriptan, 75% receiving 200 mg and 69% of patients receiving 300 mg sumatriptan, compared with 22% of patients who received placebo (P less than 0.001 all doses sumatriptan vs placebo). Adverse events were generally mild and transient, and appeared to be dose-related; the adverse event profile of 100 mg sumatriptan was similar to that of placebo. Overall, nausea/vomiting and \"bitter taste\" were the most common complaints. The proportion of patients withdrawn due to adverse events was similar in the placebo and 100 mg sumatriptan treatment groups (2% and 3%, respectively). It is concluded that 100 mg sumatriptan given orally is well tolerated with an anti-migraine efficacy comparable to that provided by the two higher doses.\r"

Sumatriptan was well tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild and transient. The most frequent complaint was irritation and pain at the site of injection. No changes in laboratory values were noted and ECG readings were unaltered by treatment. On the basis of these results, the 6 mg subcutaneous dose has been selected for further evaluation in large-scale studies.\r"

  ".W": "The health situation in Nigeria is typical of tropical Africa. It is characterised by high childhood and maternal mortality and a relatively short life expectancy. Mortality in childhood in due mainly to diseases like malaria, measles, poliomyelitis, tetanus, diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections. Diseases like filariasis, schistosomiasis and leprosy which are now readily controlled by drugs cause considerable morbidity in later life. Although the technology and tools (particularly vaccines and drugs) for the control of most of these diseases are now available, it has not been possible to make optimal use of them in Nigeria and other tropical African countries because of unfavourable social and economic conditions. The non-availability of drugs most needed for healthcare and disease control has been found to be due not only to insufficient funds but also to the use of the limited funds on expensive drugs that have little bearing on the disease pattern. The Essential Drug Programme initiated by the World Health Organisation, now adopted by Nigeria and about 100 other countries mostly in the Third World, aims to correct this unsatisfactory drug supply situation by ensuring that the available funds are used to provide those drugs needed by the large majority of the people and are made available at all times at prices that most people can afford. The Bamako Initiative in the African Region of the World Health Organization is also designed to ensure regular availability of drugs particularly to primary healthcare facilities. Seed drugs are provided to the health institutions either by the National Government or through external aid. These are sold to patients at a small profit margin. The proceeds are then used to replenish stocks and the small profit used to improve services in the health centre. The introduction of these programmes in Nigeria has improved drug availability considerably in the past couple of years and should soon start yielding further dividend in the form of measurable improvement in the health situation.\r"

Earlier studies found that multinational and national drug companies often grossly exaggerated the indications for the drugs and minimized or ignored the hazards. In the latest study, initiated in 1987, considerable improvement in promotional practices of the multinational corporations has been found, but little or no improvement on the part of the national companies. As a result, physicians are still provided with grossly exaggerated claims and the hazards of prescription drugs are covered up or glossed over. A very serious problem--the marketing of fraudulent drug products--has been identified in a number of Third World countries. Drug products are shaped and colored to resemble the original multinational company product, but contain only a small percentage of the active ingredient stated on the label, or perhaps none at all. In Indonesia fraudulent drug products may represent 20-30% of all drug products in the market. Similar fraudulent products have been reported in Brazil, Thailand, Bangladesh and Malaysia.\r"

Proposed interventions should reflect the behavioral basis for current drug use, target priority public health areas, and be feasible in developing country contexts. Most importantly, they must be critically assessed for cost and effectiveness in well-controlled field trials. The International Network for Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD) is a cooperative organization of health professionals and researchers in developing countries whose aim is to promote improved quality of care through more clinically effective and economically efficient use of pharmaceuticals. To accomplish this, INRUD will strengthen regional and national capacities to develop and scientifically evaluate programs to improve drug use and disseminate information on practical strategies shown to be cost-effective.\r"

The consumers are influenced by their beliefs about benefits, safety and cost; opinions of their social group; and emotions associated with taking the medication itself. Similar considerations apply to the prescribers or dispensers of the drugs, who are also influenced by the marketing and regulatory practices of their countries. A model of drug use which takes these factors into account can suggest various strategies to increase optimal pharmaceutical utilization. To date, these efforts have focused almost exclusively on the prescriber or manufacturer, and have had limited success. However, other, more effective techniques exist, which can modify the behavior of both of these groups, and of the consumers. A strategy of research in this area is outlined.\r"

The ability of these agents to cure infections, with little if any harm to the host, has helped to propagate their designation as \"miracle drugs\". This idea has continued throughout the past four decades and into the present one. To a large extent, this concept has led to the inappropriate use of these agents. The consequence of this misuse affects not only the individuals taking antibiotics, but indirectly others who may subsequently need antibiotics, but find that the infecting pathogen is resistant. This phenomenon results from the strong selective environmental effect of these drugs for resistant bacteria. Resistant pathogens have emerged and spread worldwide. In response to this global health problem, the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics was established. This international network of concerned prescribers and users aims to improve antibiotic use and eliminate inappropriate use worldwide. Prudent use of antibiotics will not only curtail health care costs and the potential side effects to the individual taking these drugs, but also diminish the wide ecologic effects leading to selection of antibiotic resistant forms of common disease-causing agents.\r"

Elements of a NDP include: identification of therapeutic needs; objective selection of essential drugs; drug supply and distribution system; effective legislation and regulation; quality assurance; manpower development; and dissemination of drug-related information. Drug availability does not ensure their rational prescribing or dispensing or appropriate patient use. It is proposed that a flexible multi-disciplinary curriculum be established for healthcare professionals and students and public policy formulators to provide instruction in NDP elements and the principles of rational drug use. Such courses may stimulate multi-disciplinary drug-related scholarly activities.\r"

One hundred fifty-six patients were enrolled from 15 institutions. Six patients were subsequently excluded. One hundred fifty patients underwent surgery and are evaluable for analysis (median follow-up time, 3.1 years; range, 4 months to 5.1 years). Curative resection could be performed on 46% of patients (69 of 150), noncurative resection on 12% (18 of 150), while 42% were found to be unresectable (63 of 150). Thirty-day surgical mortality and morbidity rates in patients with attempted resection were 2.7% and 13%, respectively. The curative resection group was observed to have an improved median survival (37.1 months) compared with the noncurative resection group (21.2 months) and the unresectable group (16.5 months) (P less than .01). Computed tomographic (CT) scan was a poor predictor for resectability, and age was not a contraindication to curative resection. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values were also a poor predictor for resectability. However, the median CEA value 61 to 180 days postsurgery was significantly higher in unresectable patients compared with median CEA levels in noncuratively and curatively resected groups (P less than .01). Our results imply that curative resection leads to an increase in median survival. Noncurative resection provides no benefit to asymptomatic patients, since unresectable and noncurative resection groups have similar life expectancies. Longer follow-up will be needed to demonstrate the ultimate impact of curative resection on survival.\r"

  ".U": "91259160\r", 
  ".W": "Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (DF3, F36/22, CU18) were used to monitor expression of distinct epitopes present within a family of mucin-like, breast carcinoma-associated molecules. Primary tumor specimens from more than 190 stage II breast cancer patients were evaluated for expression of the high molecular weight antigens. With a median follow-up of 6 years, patients whose tumors exhibited high immunoperoxidase staining scores (greater than 50% positive cells) with MAb DF3 had a superior disease-free survival ([DFS] 56% +/- 6% v 37% +/- 5% at 6 years; P = .0088) and overall survival ([OS] 72% +/- 5% v 59% +/- 5% at 6 years; P = .025). Staining scores with the other two antibodies did not correlate with improved prognosis. For MAbs DF3 and CU18, patients whose tumors exhibited predominantly apical cellular reactivity patterns had improved DFS, although differences reached conventional levels of statistical significance only with MAb CU18. In multivariate analyses, the prognostic value of MAb DF3 staining was independent of other identified prognostic factors. Furthermore, the concordance between primary and axillary lymph node metastases staining with each MAb was 73%, 80%, and 85% for MAbs DF3, F36/22, and CU18, respectively. These results suggest that staining with MAb DF3 identifies a group of node-positive women with a relatively favorable prognosis. Expression of the DF3 mucin-like glycoprotein is related to better differentiation, and staining with MAb DF3 provides an accurate and objective estimate of clinical outcome independent of histopathologic evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "In the attempt to improve current adjuvant results in patients with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes, in November 1981 we activated a prospective randomized study to assess the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) for 12 courses versus CMF for eight courses followed by Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) for four courses. The 5-year results were evaluated in a total of 486 patients entered into the study up to December 1987. CMF chemotherapy was delivered IV for a total of 12 courses when given alone and for eight courses when followed by four courses of Adriamycin. All drugs were recycled every 3 weeks. Rather than temporarily reducing doses, drug administration was delayed for 1 to 2 weeks in the face of myelosuppression on the planned day of treatment. After a median follow-up of 61 months, no significant differences were evident between the treatment groups in terms of relapse-free (CMF 74% v CMF followed by Adriamycin 72%) and total survival (CMF 89% v CMF followed by Adriamycin 86%). Drug treatments were fairly well tolerated and devoid of life-threatening toxicity. Present results, which were not influenced by menopausal status, indicate that Adriamycin given after CMF failed to improve treatment outcome over CMF alone. However, the role of Adriamycin in an adjuvant setting remains to be further clarified. Considering the good 5-year results achieved in this study at the expense of minimal toxicity, full-dose CMF remains, at present, the adjuvant chemotherapy of choice for patients with one to three positive nodes.\r"

Stratification was made according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and according to size of residual disease after surgery. Response was evaluated after six courses when patients were restaged, with laparoscopy or laparotomy in clinical complete responders or those with no assessable disease. Treatment was then stopped in surgically proven complete responders. Patients with partial (PR) or minor response (MR) received a further six courses of their original drug at a reduced dose (carboplatin 300 mg/m2, iproplatin 225 mg/m2). Patients with stable (SD), progressive (PD), or recurrent disease were treated with cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2). The response rates were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 74%) for carboplatin and 38% (95% CI, 26% to 51%) for iproplatin. Fifteen patients were not assessable for response. The median survival was 114 weeks (95% CI, 82 to 233 weeks) for carboplatin patients and 68 weeks (95% CI, 48 to 82 weeks) for iproplatin patients (P = .008). The amount of residual disease after initial laparotomy was a prognostic factor for survival. Myelosuppression was the main toxicity and was greater with iproplatin. This study shows carboplatin to be more active than iproplatin in the treatment of ovarian cancer and less toxic. Few responses to cyclophosphamide occurred following either drug, implying resistance to the alkylating agent.\r"

Hershey Medical Center, 48 patients; Southeastern Cancer Study Group [SECSG], 162 patients). As the criteria for patient selection and drugs used were similar, we have pooled the data to analyze the effects of these two treatments. Both studies used BCG (Tice, Chicago, IL) 3 x 10(8) live organisms per treatment by Tine technique and C parvum (Burroughs-Wellcome, Triangle Park, NC) subcutaneous at a dose of 4 mg/m2 (SECSG) or 5 micrograms/m2 (Hershey) per treatment. The only difference in these studies was the frequency of immunization, with patients in Hershey receiving 22 doses and the SECSG patients receiving 55 doses during the 2-year period of treatment. Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis for the 210 patients shows a prolonged disease-free interval for patients treated with C parvum (P = .02, two-sided Mantel procedure). In similar fashion, patients treated with C parvum had an improved survival rate (from all causes) when compared with BCG-treated patients (P = .012). An analysis of the results for the 170 patients for which the number of positive nodes was available was performed using Cox's model, with nodes as a stratification variable and with covariates of place, treatment, age, and sex. In this analysis, an observed benefit for C parvum on the disease-free interval had a P value of .37 while the benefit of C parvum on the survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .04. When the same analysis was performed using only patients aged younger than 60 years, the observed benefit of C parvum on disease-free interval had a P value of .08 and the benefit of C parvum on survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .008.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1984 and 1989, 159 patients presenting with advanced germ cell cancer were entered on a randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and toxicity of etoposide and bleomycin and either standard-dose cisplatin (20 mg/m2 daily for 5 days) or high-dose cisplatin (40 mg/m2 daily for 5 days). Of the 159 patients, 153 were assessable for toxicity and response. As expected, patients receiving the high-dose cisplatin regimen experienced significantly more neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting, and myelo-suppression. Four patients (3%) died related to therapy. Despite the toxicity encountered, dose intensity was maintained. Overall, 84% of patients in the high-dose arm received 80% or more of the projected dose of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin; and 90% of patients on the standard-dose arm received 80% or more of the projected dose. Of the 76 eligible patients randomized to receive the high-dose cisplatin regimen, 52 (68%) became disease-free with chemotherapy alone or with subsequent resection of residual teratoma or cancer. Of the 77 patients randomized to the standard-dose arm, 56 (73%) became disease-free with chemotherapy alone or with surgery. Median follow-up is now 24 months. Eleven patients (three high-dose and eight standard-dose) relapsed from disease-free status. Overall, 74% of patients receiving the high-dose cisplatin regimen are alive, and 63% are continuously free of disease. Of the patients receiving the standard-dose cisplatin regimen, 74% are alive, and 61% are continuously free of disease. This randomized prospective trial in advanced germ cell cancer achieved dose intensity of the most active single agent in this disease. This dose intensity did not translate into an improved survival or cure. We conclude that dose escalation of cisplatin beyond standard doses results in excess toxicity with no accompanying therapeutic benefit.\r"

  ".W": "The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) evaluated in a prospective study the hypothesis that patients who had localized, visible residual neuroblastoma without regional lymph node involvement after surgery (POG stage B) have a favorable prognosis when treated with moderate intensive chemotherapy. Eligible patients were initially treated with five courses of Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Evansville, IN) and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) followed by surgery (CY/AD +/- surgery). Those patients not achieving a complete remission (CR) crossed over to five courses of cisplatin and teniposide (PL/VM) +/- surgery. Radiation therapy (XRT) was given to selected patients who still were not in CR after the crossover therapy. Of the 61 eligible patients, 38 (62%) patients achieved CR after CY/AD proven by clinical (31) or surgical (seven) evaluation. One (2%) patient in clinical partial remission (PR-C) entered CR without further therapy. Nineteen (31%) patients achieved CR with the following salvage therapies: surgery (five), PL/VM +/- surgery (five) followed by XRT (three) or autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) (one) and further courses of CY/AD +/- PL/VM instead of courses of PL/VM (five). The overall CR rate was 95% (58 of 61). Four patients had recurrence of the disease. The probability of being disease-free at 3 years after initial or salvage therapy was estimated at 84% (SE, 5%). The overall prognosis of children older than 1 year and younger than 1 year was similar (P = .26). If, however, the three remission deaths (all younger than 1 year) were censored, there was only one other failure in 32 children younger than one versus seven of 29 children older than 1 year (P = .018). These results confirm the excellent prognosis for patients with POG stage B neuroblastoma and indicate that most patients are curable with CY/AD +/- surgery, and those not achieving CR with this therapy are curable with alternate therapy.\r"

Duration of treatment was 2 years for stages I, II, and III and 3 years for stage IV disease. Of the 93 patients entered onto the study, 47 had diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma (DSNCL), 38 had diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL), and eight had other histologies. Localized disease (stages I and II) was present in 51 patients, and 42 had advanced (stages III and IV) disease. The study confirmed previously reported importance of stage with a 4-year event-free survival (EFS) of 78% (SE +/- 7%) for patients with localized disease as compared with 44% (SE +/- 9%) in patients with advanced disease (P less than or equal to .001). In localized disease, seven of 11 adverse events occurred in patients who were off therapy and more than 30 months after the initial diagnosis (relapse, three; second malignancy, two; death in remission, two). Large-cell histology proved to be an important prognostic factor in patients with stages III and IV disease with EFS at 4 years of 67% (SE +/- 11%) for DLCL versus 17% (SE +/- 11%) for DSNCL (P less than or equal to .001). We conclude that it is important to distinguish histologically between small noncleaved-cell and large-cell types of NLBL as a basis for further controlled clinical trials.\r"

To determine whether current follow-up procedures are effective in identifying preclinical disease, we analyzed patterns of relapse in 139 LCL patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) with high/moderate-dose methotrexate with leucovorin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (M/m-BACOD). The timing and results of all posttreatment follow-up tests were examined in the 36 patients who relapsed from complete remission (CR) and 46 controls who remain in CR. Despite conscientious posttreatment follow-up, only two of the 36 relapses (6%) were detected before the development of symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of patients relapsed in new disease sites (42% in new and old sites, and 25% in new sites only). Consistent with this observation, the tests most sensitive to clinical relapse were those not targeted to specific sites of disease: gallium scan (sensitivity, 90%), physical examination (80%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (65%). Of screening tests performed, only LDH was successful in detecting preclinical relapse, with a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 85% for impending symptomatic relapse. These results indicate that conventional screening was ineffective in detecting preclinical relapse in LCL patients. We recommend prospective evaluation of a strategy that (1) screens with a frequency appropriate to a patient's risk of relapse, (2) uses sensitive test(s) not targeted to specific sites, and (3) limits aggressive screening to those high-risk patients eligible for potentially curative salvage therapy.\r"

Esorubicin was administered at two dose levels: 25 mg/m2 for patients at risk for excessive myelosuppression, and at 30 mg/m2 for all others at 21-day intervals. Overall, 33 of 88 patients (38%) responded to treatment including three complete remissions (CRs; 3%) and 30 partial remissions (PRs; 34%), with the median duration of response lasting 6.2 months.

Twelve of 33 responding patients (36%) had relatively durable remissions lasting from 1 to more than 4 years. Leukopenia (less than 3,000 cells per microliter) was seen in 65 of 88 patients (74%) and was severe (less than 1,000 cells per microliter) in 20 of 88 patients (23%). Clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure were not seen and the ejection fraction (EF) fell 10% to 20% in three patients. Esorubicin is an active agent in patients with NHL or HD at the time of first relapse.\r"

Eighteen patients were primarily resistant to conventional daunorubicin and Ara-C induction treatment; eight patients had relapsed within 6 months from initial remission; six patients had relapsed after a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) procedure. Overall, 21 patients (66%) achieved a complete remission (CR), two (6%) died of infection during induction, and nine (28%) had resistant disease. Age greater than 50 years was the only factor predictive for a significantly lower response rate (P = .03). The median remission duration was 16 weeks; the overall median survival was 36 weeks. Severe myelosuppression was observed in all patients resulting in fever or documented infections in 91% of patients. Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. We conclude that the MEC regimen has significant antileukemic activity and acceptable toxicity in salvage AML. Its benefit in front-line AML therapy is being investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclophosphamide (CY) cardiotoxicity may be a lethal complication of bone marrow transplantation. Previous echocardiographic studies have reported that left ventricular dysfunction due to CY occurs in over 50% of patients undergoing transplantation. To evaluate the cardiotoxicity of new dosing protocols that included twice-daily rather than once-daily CY, 44 bone marrow transplantation patients were prospectively evaluated with serial ECGs and echocardiograms. Twenty-six patients received a once-daily lower-dose protocol (mean total 87 +/- 11 mg/kg), and 18 patients received a twice-daily higher-dose (mean total 174 +/- 34 mg/kg) CY regimen. In the higher-dose CY group, significant reductions in summed ECG voltage (-20%) (P less than .01) and increases in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (+10%) (P less than .05) were detected in the first week following therapy. These changes resolved by the third week following CY and were significantly greater than the changes noted in the lower-dose group. However, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) did not change significantly in either group. Five patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity (four, pericarditis; one, congestive heart failure); four of the five patients were in the higher-dose group (P = .14). Only a prior history of congestive heart failure or a baseline EF less than 50% was an independent correlate of clinical cardiotoxicity (P less than .05). Thus, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity following the use of CY for bone marrow transplantation is evident as reversible decreases in ECG voltage and increases in left ventricular mass, possibly reflecting myocardial edema or hemorrhage. However, systolic dysfunction is much less common with these new twice-daily dosing regimens when compared with earlier studies of high-dose once-daily CY.\r"

Patients were given toxicity gradings retrospectively in each of eight organ systems (cardiac, bladder, renal, pulmonary, hepatic, CNS, stomatic, and gastrointestinal) according to a recently developed RRT scale. A set of patient, disease, and treatment parameters (age, sex, diagnosis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score, preconditioning liver function tests [LFT], prior chemotherapy exposure, disease status, graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] prophylaxis, antimicrobial agent use, hematologic recovery, and severity of acute GVHD) was statistically analyzed to determine significant predictors of RRT. The most common significant organ toxicities were stomatic (87% of patients; 63% grades II to IV) and hepatic (83% of patients; 44% grades II to IV). Renal and gastrointestinal toxicities were not uncommon (35% and 27%, respectively) but were rarely serious (9% and 1% grades II to IV, respectively). Twelve patients developed grade III toxicities of the following systems: hepatic (seven), pulmonary (two), bladder (two), and CNS (one). Females had more frequent stomatitis (P = .04) and hepatic RRT (P = .004). Patients receiving methotrexate in their GVHD prophylactic regimen experienced more grade II to IV stomatitis (P = .04) and hepatic RRT (P = .04). The use of amphotericin B (P = .01) or prolonged antibiotic courses (P = .04) was associated with more grades II to IV hepatic RRT. In a multivariate analysis, only amphotericin B administration predicted grades II to IV hepatic RRT (P = .01). The incidence of acute GVHD was 49%, with 31% having grades II to IV GVHD. The estimated 2-year event-free survival (EFS) for the entire study group was 44%. The estimated 2-year EFS was 63% for standard-risk patients (acute leukemia in first remission and chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] in first stable phase) and 24% for all others (high-risk patients). High-risk patients were at increased risk of disease recurrence and RRT. BuCy is an efficacious bone marrow transplant conditioning regimen for standard-risk patients with leukemia but has significant associated hepatic RRT.\r"

Patients had advanced cancer, measurable disease, and a good performance level. Treatment included a 5-day continuous infusion of 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d of rIL-2 followed by 1 day of rest, 4 days of leukapheresis to collect cells for in vitro augmentation of cellular cytotoxicity, and 5 more days of rIL-2 infusion with reinfusion of LAK cells for 3 successive days. Therapy was repeated after 2 weeks. There were 117 patients enrolled: 63% were males, with a median age of 51 years. Eighty-two percent were managed in oncology units, and 18% were in intensive care units. Six patients died within 1 month of initiating therapy. In renal cell carcinoma, the response rate was one of 31 patients (3%), with a median survival of 10.7 months. In melanoma, the response rate was four of 33 patients (12%), with a median survival of 6.1 months. For all other histologies, response rate was three of 53 patients (5%), with a median survival of 7.4 months. All responders were asymptomatic when therapy was initiated. This trial confirms the feasibility of administering continuous rIL-2 and LAK cells outside the intensive care unit environment. Antitumor activity in melanoma was similar to that seen in multicenter trials of bolus rIL-2 and LAK cells. Activity in renal cell cancer was disappointing.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a T-cell-derived colony-stimulating factor (CSF) whose primary targets include relatively early, multipotential, hematopoietic progenitor cells. In this trial, we treated 24 patients with recombinant human IL-3 given by a daily 4-hour intravenous infusion for 28 days. The dose levels were 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 micrograms/m2/d. At least three patients were entered at every dose level. Each participant suffered from bone marrow failure, with the underlying diagnosis being myelodysplastic syndrome (13 patients), aplastic anemia (eight patients), or aplasia after prolonged high-dose chemotherapy (three patients) for multiple myeloma, breast cancer, or acute myelogenous leukemia. Most patients tolerated therapy well, with the most frequent side effects being low-grade fever and headaches. Hematopoietic changes included modest increases in neutrophil counts (eight patients), eosinophil counts (six patients), platelet counts (three patients), and reticulocyte counts (two patients). An increase in blasts occurred in one patient who had refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation and was reversible once IL-3 was discontinued. In addition, one patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia showed an increase in monocytes (and granulocytes). Progression to acute leukemia did not occur. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed a rapid clearance with a mean half-life of 18.8 minutes at the 60 micrograms/m2/d dose, and 52.9 minutes at the 250 micrograms/m2/d dose. Serum concentrations of 10 to 20 ng/mL of IL-3 were achievable at the 250 micrograms/m2/d dose. Our observations indicate that recombinant human IL-3 can be given safely at doses of 1,000 micrograms/m2/d or less. In addition, on the basis of preclinical data and the biologic activity observed in this study, further trials of this molecule, alone and in combination with other growth factors, are warranted in patients with pancytopenia.\r"

Blood monocytes were collected by leukapheresis and then purified by counterflow elutriation (up to 10(9) cells, with a purity of greater than 90%). Ex vivo activation was obtained by incubating these cells with 1 micrograms liposomal MTP-PE/10(6) monocytes for 18 hours in hydrophobic culture bags at 37 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide humidified air. The activated monocytes were then infused in the peritoneal cavity once a week for 5 consecutive weeks through an implanted peritoneal infusion system, Port-A-Cath (Pharmacia Deltec, St Paul, MN), on an intrapatient dose-escalating schedule (10(7) to 10(9) monocytes). No severe adverse reactions occurred. Toxicity was mild, the chief acute reactions being fever (27%), chills (13%), and abdominal pain (25%). None of the side effects led to dose reduction. No consistent change in hemostatic function, liver function, or renal function was observed. Significant increases in granulocyte counts, neopterine, and acute phase reactants (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein) occurred in the peripheral blood. In vitro monocyte activation was demonstrated by the relapse of procoagulant activity and monokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha]) in the supernatants of cultured monocytes. Evidence for in vivo monocyte activation was provided by the increase of these monokines in the peritoneal fluids. Kinetic studies with indium-111 (111In)-labeled activated autologous monocytes in five patients suggest that these infused monocytes may remain in the peritoneal cavity for up to 7 days. This locoregional immunotherapeutic approach seems to be encouraging in view of adjuvant therapeutic modality in ovarian cancer patients with minimal residual intraabdominal disease following second-look laparotomy.\r"

  ".W": "Taxol is a unique mitotic inhibitor that has entered phase II investigation. Phase I studies demonstrated hypersensitivity reactions that were related to the cremophor vehicle and to the rate of drug infusion. As a result, the time span of intravenous (IV) infusion of taxol was routinely prolonged to 6 hours or beyond, and premedication with diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and cimetidine was initiated. Early studies showed antitumor activity, especially against malignant melanoma and ovarian carcinoma. This phase I trial was performed giving taxol, as a 6-hour IV infusion every 21 days, without premedication. The purpose was to study the necessity of premedication and its impact on toxicity and pharmacokinetics. Thirty-one patients received 64 assessable courses of taxol. One patient had a hypersensitivity reaction, which was easily controlled using routine measures. Myelosuppression was dose-limiting, but sporadic, with two fatalities due to sepsis. Nonhematologic toxicity was of grade 1 and 2 except for one patient with grade 3 mucositis and two patients with grade 3 neuropathy. The neuropathy consisted of reversible painful paresthesias, requiring discontinuation of drug in two patients. Four partial responses were seen (three in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, one in a patient with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary). Pharmacokinetic values were consistent with those previously reported. The occurrence of myelosuppression or neurotoxicity appeared to be associated with the area under the concentration x time curve (AUC) of taxol. The recommended phase II starting dose on this schedule is 225 mg/m2. Taxol merits broad investigation at the phase II level.\r"

Patients received oral doses of 8 mg, 4 mg, or 1 mg of ondansetron three times daily for 2 days, with the first dose given 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide infusion. We then evaluated the efficacy of a conventional antiemetic regimen of intravenous lorazepam, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine given before chemotherapy and 10 mg prochlorperazine given orally twice on study day 1 and three times on study day 2 in a fourth series of 20 patients with comparable characteristics. The number of emetic episodes, assessment of nausea and appetite, and adverse events were recorded throughout the 2-day study period. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical laboratory data were also collected. No emesis was observed during the 2-day study period in 17 (85%), 13 (65%), and 11 (55%) patients treated with 8-mg, 4-mg, and 1-mg ondansetron doses, respectively, and in seven (35%) patients who received conventional therapy. The incidence and intensity of nausea were lower with increasing doses of ondansetron and were lower than in the conventional group. Ondansetron-related side effects were generally mild and reversible and did not appear to increase in a dose-dependent manner. These effects included headache, stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated serum transaminase concentrations. One patient who received three 1 mg doses of ondansetron experienced tremors and muscle twitching. Oral ondansetron is an effective and safe antiemetic for patients receiving noncisplatin cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and its antiemetic activity appears to be dose-related.\r"

  ".U": "91259181\r", 
  ".W": "The antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used hormonal therapy for breast cancer. The drug exerts its antiproliferative effects primarily through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated mechanisms, although other cellular actions may augment tumor inhibition. Clinically, tamoxifen has been less well studied in premenopausal than in postmenopausal patients. The drug has complex endocrine effects that are dependent on the treatment duration and dose, menopausal status, and target organ. In postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, serum estrogen levels remain low, and the normally elevated gonadotropin levels decrease. In contrast, serum estrogen levels are strikingly elevated in many premenopausal women, and gonadotropin concentrations are either unchanged or slightly increased. Large systematic trials in metastatic breast cancer have established tamoxifen as the recommended hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumors. Tamoxifen is also an active agent for premenopausal metastatic disease, and response rates are comparable to those reported for oophorectomy. Clinical experience with tamoxifen in this younger age group, however, is more limited. Few premenopausal women (less than 400) have been included in phase II and phase III trials. Two randomized trials (total of 160 patients) comparing oophorectomy with tamoxifen do not definitively establish therapeutic equivalence, and a survival advantage for either treatment cannot be excluded. Many questions remain concerning the appropriate role for tamoxifen in premenopausal patients. Still, tamoxifen has an attractive toxicity profile, and it offers a favorable therapeutic alternative for premenopausal women with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer who wish to avoid surgical or radiation castration.\r"

These disorders are becoming more common, and the patients are frequently being referred to medical oncologists for assistance in management. The development of advanced laboratory techniques, such as molecular genetics and cell-surface phenotyping, has greatly enhanced our understanding of their pathogenesis and may lead to identification of responsible etiologic factors. A myriad of treatment options have been investigated including topical approaches, systemic chemotherapy, and external radiation. Currently, extensive trials are underway examining the potential benefits of agents such as the interferons, interleukin-2, monoclonal antibodies, the retinoids, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and other novel biologic response modifiers or chemotherapeutics. Although all these therapies have benefit in phase II trials, few randomized comparative trials have been performed to identify optimal therapies. Performance of such trials should now become a priority.\r"

  ".W": "A random-sample, anonymous survey of the members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) was conducted in spring 1990 measuring the attitudes and experiences of American oncologists concerning the antiemetic use of marijuana in cancer chemotherapy patients. The survey was mailed to about one third (N = 2,430) of all United States-based ASCO members and yielded a response rate of 43% (1,035). More than 44% of the respondents report recommending the (illegal) use of marijuana for the control of emesis to at least one cancer chemotherapy patient. Almost one half (48%) would prescribe marijuana to some of their patients if it were legal. As a group, respondents considered smoked marijuana to be somewhat more effective than the legally available oral synthetic dronabinol ([THC] Marinol; Unimed, Somerville, NJ) and roughly as safe. Of the respondents who expressed an opinion, a majority (54%) thought marijuana should be available by prescription. These results bear on the question of whether marijuana has a \"currently accepted medical use,\" at issue in an ongoing administrative and legal dispute concerning whether marijuana in smoked form should be available by prescription along with synthetic THC in oral form. This survey demonstrates that oncologists' experience with the medical use of marijuana is more extensive, and their opinions of it are more favorable, than the regulatory authorities appear to have believed.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven experimental saccular aneurysms were created on the common carotid artery of swine. Between 3 and 15 days after creation of these aneurysms, they were thrombosed via an endovascular approach, using a very soft detachable platinum coil delivered through a microcatheter positioned within the aneurysm. This detachable platinum coil was soldered to a stainless steel delivery guidewire. Intra-aneurysmal thrombosis was then initiated by applying a low positive direct electric current to the delivery guidewire. Thrombosis occurred because of the attraction of negatively charged white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, and fibrinogen to the positively charged platinum coil positioned within the aneurysm. The passage of electric current detached the platinum coil within the clotted aneurysm in 4 to 12 minutes. This detachment was elicited by electrolysis of the stainless steel wire nearest to the thrombus-covered platinum coil. Control angiograms obtained 2 to 6 months postembolization confirmed permanent aneurysm occlusion as well as patency of the parent artery in all cases. No angiographic manifestation of untoward distal embolization was noted. Due to the encouraging results of this research, this technique has been applied in selected clinical cases which are described in Part 2 of this study.\r"

The CBF was determined by the hydrogen clearance method; the EEG was recorded continuously and a power spectrum analysis was performed. Cerebral ischemia was produced by occlusion of both common carotid arteries and induction of hypotension (approximately 50 mm Hg). The flat EEG reversibility was investigated for 3 hours after reperfusion. As parameters of brain development, the neuronal density and the time at which the S-100 protein appeared in the brain were examined. Normal CBF was highest in neonatal pigs and decreased with age. The critical CBF at a flat EEG was lowest in newborn pigs and was elevated with development of the brain. Tolerance against cerebral ischemia was greatest in newborn pigs.\r"

  ".W": "The loss of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) was investigated in a feline model of intracranial hypertension. Threshold values of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) required for maintenance of SSEP's are defined using a mathematical model. The model describes loss of amplitude of SSEP's using the form of a dose-response curve. Amplitude of the SSEP's declined to 50% of control values at a CBF of 15 ml/100 gm/min and a CPP of 20 mm Hg in the normoxic animal; in the presence of mild hypoxia (8 to 9 kPa), a significant increase in these values to 18 ml/100 gm/min and 32 mm Hg, respectively, occurred. No reliable changes in latency or central conduction time were demonstrated. It is concluded that given adequate oxygenation, evoked electrical activity is lost at too low a level of CPP for this parameter to be useful in clinical monitoring. However, even mild hypoxia, when combined with intracranial hypertension, produces a major risk to neuronal integrity.\r"

  ".W": "A new computerized bipolar coagulator is described in which tissue heating is switched off automatically when adequate vessel occlusion has been achieved, thus preventing overheating, undue tissue damage, cutting, and sticking of the forceps. Experiments with radiofrequency (rf) heating of albumin or arteries revealed an impedance minimum at the moment of coagulation. The attainment of this impedance minimum is transmitted electronically via a microprocessor to the coagulator, which automatically shuts off the rf energy supply. In experiments, adequate artery strength and avoidance of the drawbacks of conventional coagulation methods were achieved when rf heating was shut off soon after the impedance minimum was reached. Neither irrigation for cooling nor cleaning of the forceps tips was necessary. Electronic feedback through the same cables as used for coagulation enabled the use of conventional bipolar cables and forceps. The bipolar coagulator described can also be used for conventional bipolar coagulation under visual control. The microcomputer enables: 1) automatic coagulation cycles that start when tissue is picked up in the forceps and stop automatically on completion of the seal; 2) the change of power setting from a pedal and activation of automatic cycles by the pedal as described above or surgeon-controlled coagulation, which facilitates the use of alternative debridement with inactive forceps; 3) cable testing; and 4) negligible disturbance of the intraoperative monitoring equipment.\r"

  ".U": "91259235\r", 
  ".W": "In patients with spinal cord injury, the primary or mechanical trauma seldom causes total transection, even though the functional loss may be complete. In addition, biochemical and pathological changes in the cord may worsen after injury. To explain these phenomena, the concept of the secondary injury has evolved for which numerous pathophysiological mechanisms have been postulated. This paper reviews the concept of secondary injury with special emphasis on vascular mechanisms. Evidence is presented to support the theory of secondary injury and the hypothesis that a key mechanism is posttraumatic ischemia with resultant infarction of the spinal cord. Evidence for the role of vascular mechanisms has been obtained from a variety of models of acute spinal cord injury in several species. Many different angiographic methods have been used for assessing microcirculation of the cord and for measuring spinal cord blood flow after trauma. With these techniques, the major systemic and local vascular effects of acute spinal cord injury have been identified and implicated in the etiology of secondary injury. The systemic effects of acute spinal cord injury include hypotension and reduced cardiac output. The local effects include loss of autoregulation in the injured segment of the spinal cord and a marked reduction of the microcirculation in both gray and white matter, especially in hemorrhagic regions and in adjacent zones. The microcirculatory loss extends for a considerable distance proximal and distal to the site of injury. Many studies have shown a dose-dependent reduction of spinal cord blood flow varying with the severity of injury, and a reduction of spinal cord blood flow which worsens with time after injury. The functional deficits due to acute spinal cord injury have been measured electrophysiologically with techniques such as motor and somatosensory evoked potentials and have been found proportional to the degree of posttraumatic ischemia. The histological effects include early hemorrhagic necrosis leading to major infarction at the injury site. These posttraumatic vascular effects can be treated. Systemic normotension can be restored with volume expansion or vasopressors, and spinal cord blood flow can be improved with dopamine, steroids, nimodipine, or volume expansion. The combination of nimodipine and volume expansion improves posttraumatic spinal cord blood flow and spinal cord function measured by evoked potentials. These results provide strong evidence that posttraumatic ischemia is an important secondary mechanism of injury, and that it can be counteracted.\r"

Best known for his work on cerebral cortical localization and speech mechanisms, Broca also carefully worked out skull and scalp localization for underlying cortical regions. In 1871, Broca treated a man who had sustained a scalp laceration from a blow to the head without loss of consciousness or skull fracture. The patient exhibited a nonfluent aphasia about 1 month after injury and became progressively obtunded and eventually comatose. Suspecting an intracranial abscess, Broca trephined at the region of the left third frontal convolution and drained an epidural abscess. The patient improved transiently but died a few days later. Autopsy showed a left-sided, predominantly frontal purulent meningoencephalitis. Broca's other neurosurgical contributions included various surgical cases, methods for scalp localization of the cerebral convolutions, extensive studies of skull and brain abnormalities, thermoencephalography, and the stimulation of younger surgical colleagues and neurologists to make practical use of cerebral localization.\r"

After baseline measurements were recorded, hetastarch or plasmanate was infused intravenously at 300 cc/hr. Thermal output determination and pressures were measured every 15 minutes. The PAWP did not correlate in a statistically significant fashion with the CVP in the ranges recorded; however, a statistically significant correlation did exist between PAWP increases and increases in CI, SVI, and LVSWI (p less than 0.01). There was no statistical correlation between PAWP increases above 14 mm Hg and improvement in cardiac performance as evidenced by CI, SVI, and LVSWI measurements. It is concluded that CVP is an unreliable index of cardiac performance during hypervolemic therapy and that, in previously healthy individuals, a PAWP of 14 mm Hg is associated with maximum cardiac performance.\r"

  ".W": "Once they become symptomatic, cavernous malformations of the brain stem appear to cause progressive morbidity from repetitive hemorrhage, and can even be fatal. Twenty-four patients with long-tract and/or cranial nerve findings from their cavernous malformations of the brain stem were seen for initial evaluation or surgical consultation and thereafter received either surgical or continued conservative treatment. The decision to operate was based on the proximity of the cavernous malformation to the pial surface of the brain stem, the patient's neurological status, and the number of symptomatic episodes. Sixteen patients were treated by definitive surgery directed at excision of their malformation. In four patients, associated venous malformations influenced the surgical approach and their recognition avoided the risk of inappropriate excision of the venous malformation. Although some of the 16 patients had transient, immediate, postoperative worsening of their neurological deficits, the outcome of all except one was the same or improved. Only one patient developed recurrent symptoms: a new deficit 2 1/2 years after surgery required reoperation after regrowth of the cavernous malformation. She has been neurologically stable since the second surgery. One patient died 6 months postoperatively from a shunt infection and sepsis. The eight conservatively treated patients are followed with annual magnetic resonance imaging studies. One has a dramatic associated venous malformation. Seven patients have either minor intermittent or no symptoms, and the eighth died from a hemorrhage 1 year after his initial presentation. Based on these results, surgical extirpation of symptomatic cavernous malformations of the brain stem appears to be the treatment of choice when a patient is symptomatic, the lesion is located superficially, and an operative approach can spare eloquent tissue. When cavernous malformations of the brain stem are completely excised, cure appears permanent.\r"

  ".U": "91259249\r", 
  ".W": "Surgical resection of 10 obscure arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) was accomplished with craniotomy guided by computerized tomography (CT) or angiography and the use of the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame. Stereotactic craniotomy was invaluable for resection of the following types of AVM's: 1) AVM's with a nidus less than 2 cm in diameter, 2) AVM's located in an eloquent area of the brain, and 3) AVM's located deep in the brain. Stereotactic localization of these AVM's on preoperative radiological studies provides a precise route to the nidus, often avoiding important areas of the brain. This series included six male and four female patients with a mean age of 32 years. All patients presented with an intracerebral hemorrhage, from which eight made a complete neurological recovery prior to surgery. Two AVM's were located on the cortex, three were found subcortically, and five were situated near the ventricles or in the deep white matter. As a guide, angiography was used in six cases and CT in four cases. In each instance, the study providing the best image of the AVM nidus was employed. Postoperatively, no neurological deficits were found in eight patients and, in the two patients with preoperative deficits, neurological improvement was observed after recovery from surgery. Postoperative studies revealed complete removal of the AVM in all patients, and all lesions were confirmed histologically. The authors conclude that stereotactic craniotomy provides the optimum operative approach for the localization and microsurgical resection of AVM's that are either obscure or located deep in the brain.\r"

  ".U": "91259250\r", 
  ".W": "Stereotactic aspiration is a valuable surgical alternative for colloid cysts when used alone or in conjunction with microsurgical resection. Since 1981, the authors have performed computerized tomography (CT)-guided stereotactic aspiration as the initial procedure in 22 patients with colloid cysts; stereotactic aspiration alone was successful in 11 patients (50%). Of the 11 patients in whom aspiration failed, stereotactic endoscopic resection was attempted in three and was successful in one. Seven patients required a craniotomy and microsurgical removal of the cyst performed via a transcortical approach. The preoperative CT appearance in eight cases of a hypodense or isodense cyst correlated favorably with successful aspiration of the cyst in six patients. A hyperdense appearance on the preoperative CT scan in 14 cases was associated with subtotal aspiration in 13 patients; five required craniotomy for removal. Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in eight patients provided excellent anatomical definition of the cyst and its relationship to other structures of the third ventricle, but it was not possible to correlate successful aspiration with cyst appearance on MR images with short or long relaxation time sequences. The authors' 9-year experience suggests that preoperative CT studies accurately determine size, predict viscosity, and help to define a group of colloid cyst patients for whom stereotactic cyst aspiration will likely be successful. Unsuccessful stereotactic aspiration was related to two features: the high viscosity of the intracystic colloid material (nine patients), or deviation of the cyst away from the aspiration needle due to small cyst volume (two patients). Because of its simplicity and low risk, stereotactic surgery can be offered to selected patients as the initial procedure of choice. Craniotomy can be reserved for those whose imaging studies predict failure or for those whose cyst cannot be aspirated.\r"

The aneurysms ranged from 4 to 16 mm in diameter. There were no complications associated with the coronary angiography nor with the additional intracranial IA-DSA, which required less than 5 minutes to perform in all cases. The value of performing intracranial IA-DSA in patients undergoing coronary angiography to screen for unruptured asymptomatic aneurysm is discussed, as is the possible racial differences in the frequency of aneurysms.\r"

  ".W": "A consecutive series of 145 patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were operated on within 7 days of SAH and were prospectively evaluated over a 4-year period to determine if the timing of aneurysm surgery influenced the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. All patients were managed with a standardized policy of urgent surgical clipping and treatment with aggressive prophylactic postoperative volume expansion. Patients with delayed ischemic symptoms were additionally treated with induced hypertension. Forty-nine patients underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 (Group 1) post-SAH, 60 patients on Day 2 or 3 (Group 2), and 36 patients on Days 4 through 7 (Group 3). Postoperative delayed cerebral ischemia developed in 16% of (Group 1) patients, in 22% of Group 2 patients, and in 28% of Group 3 patients. Cerebral infarction resulting from delayed cerebral ischemia developed in only 4% of Group 1 patients, 10% of Group 2 patients, and 11% of Group 3 patients. A bad clinical outcome as a result of delayed cerebral ischemia occurred in one Group 1 patient (2%), two Group 2 patients (3%), and one Group 3 patient (3%). Preoperative grade was not significantly correlated with the incidence or severity of delayed cerebral ischemia at any time interval except that patients in modified Hunt and Hess Grade I or II who underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 after SAH had no strokes or bad outcomes from delayed cerebral ischemia. This study demonstrates that there is no rationale for delaying aneurysm surgery based on the time interval between SAH and patient evaluation.\r"

The functional significance of this area has been somewhat unclear, and information regarding its influence on motor output has largely been based on evoked responses to direct stimulation in primates and humans. In this series of patients with primary and metastatic tumors involving the dominant hemisphere SMA, a distinct pattern of postoperative deficits and recovery has emerged which emphasizes the role of this critical area in the initiation of motor activity, including speech. Based upon this analysis, ablation of this region after first identifying the primary motor cortex may be accomplished without risk of permanent loss of motor activity or speech function, despite the initial severe deficits.\r"

Although temporary neurological deterioration due to the technique was recorded in one patient, no permanent neurological deficit was observed in this series and there were no deaths. It is believed that this new technology is a viable alternative in the management of patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms.

This system proved useful for observing the contraction and ultrastructural changes of the living cells. Hemolysate-treated cells showed augmented responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine and leukotriene C4, but not to KCl. This augmented response diminished gradually during the culture period. Both a phospholipase C blocking agent, 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl-n,n-diphenylcarbamate (NCDC), and a myosin light chain kinase blocking agent, 1-(5-chloronaphthalenesulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine (ML-9), suppressed this augmented response. Protein kinase C activity of the cells, as measured by Western blot analysis, did not increase during the period of culture with hemolysate. The results obtained suggest that hemolysate had the following effects on the cells: 1) acute but gradual contraction of the cells; 2) augmentation of cellular responses to vasoactive agents; and 3) progressive contraction and morphological alteration of the cells. Possible mechanisms by which hemolysate exerts these effects are discussed, taking into consideration the interrelationship between these effects.\r"

  ".W": "The technology of visible light-curing resin has recently been developed for use in removable prosthodontics. A quartz halogen lamp producing a 400- to 500-nanometer wave-length spectrum of visible light is used to polymerize high-molecular-weight acrylic resin monomers. While several in vitro and in vivo studies of visible light-curing resin are found in the dental literature, no studies have yet been performed to evaluate it as an intracorporeal implant in surgery. The authors have designed a rat model of microcervical corpectomy to assess vertebral body replacement with visible light-curing resin in comparison to conventional autopolymerizing methyl methacrylate. Spinal cord function tests, spinal-implant stability assessments, and histological evaluations were made in a total of 41 rats at 2, 4, or 6 months postimplant. No animal developed a neurological deficit or radiographic instability, and at sacrifice there was no evidence of implant fracture-extrusion. In addition, there were no signs of adverse reaction in the surrounding tissues. Morphological investigation of the resin/bone interface at 6 months revealed very good implant anchorage. Visible light-curing resin was found to be far superior to methyl methacrylate for construction of spinal implants. Its waxy consistency makes it easy to handle. It remains pliable until light is applied, allowing adjustments in shape for a well-fitted implant without time constraints. Applied in layers, adjustments can be made even after polymerization of a previous layer. This new implantable resin will allow safer, immediate stabilization in patients with neoplastic destruction of the spine, and may also be advantageous for other neurosurgical applications, such as cranioplasty.\r"

Fourteen (88%) of the malignant gliomas and one (17%) of the benign gliomas were found to be positive for TGF-alpha, and 14 (88%) of the malignant gliomas and two (33%) of the benign gliomas expressed EGF receptor. The proliferation index with Ki-67 was 18.8% +/- 8.1% (mean +/- standard deviation) in malignant gliomas and 1.9% +/- 1.8% in benign gliomas. In general, cells positive for EGF receptor and Ki-67 were randomly distributed throughout the tumor tissue, and cells positive for TGF-alpha tended to be clustered without obvious relationship to areas of necrosis or blood vessels. In some tumors, cells positive for TGF-alpha, EGF receptor, and Ki-67 were associated in a focal distribution. The more frequent expression of TGF-alpha and EGF receptor in the highly proliferative malignant gliomas is compatible with a role for TGF-alpha and EGF receptor in the induction or stimulation of malignant gliomas.\r"

Bones with significantly increased QBS values indicating increased bone metabolism were identified in the two patient groups. Fifty-one percent of the bones in patients with HPT and 78% in patients with TTX showed significantly increased QBS values. Increase in bone metabolism was highest in the femoral shaft. Seven patients with HPT and five with TTX were successfully treated. Six patients with HPT and four patients with TTX showed significant decrease of bone metabolism with normal QBS values after three months. The results indicate that QBS can be used to evaluate bone metabolism and its response to treatment in individual bones in patients with endocrine abnormalities.\r"

The half-life of total-body radioactivity was 58 +/- 7 hr by whole-body counts and 64 +/- 13 hr by urine measurements. Whole-body and bone marrow dose estimates ranged from 0.75-1.03 and 0.76-1.05 rad/mCi, respectively. These studies confirm the prolonged circulation and reduced immunogenicity of chimeric 17-1A versus murine 17-1A. Marrow radiation exposure using antibodies with prolonged circulation is a critical factor in planning for radioimmunotherapeutic applications.\r"

  ".W": "Technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA) is a synthetic ligand to the hepatocyte receptor, hepatic binding protein (HBP). A five-state mathematical model containing a bimolecular chemical reaction was utilized for quantitative estimation of the following physiologic and biochemical parameters: extrahepatic plasma volume Ve; hepatic plasma flow F and volume Vh; receptor-ligand forward-binding rate constant kb and reaction volume Vr; and receptor concentration [R]o. Nine normal subjects were studied. Given (a) liver and heart time-activity data, (b) the patient's weight, height, and hematocrit, (c) the fraction of injected dose in a 3-min blood sample, and (d) the amount and galactose density of the NGA dose, a computer program executed a curve-fit to the kinetic model. Systematic error, as measured by reduced chi-square, ranged from 1.43 to 2.56. Based on the nine imaging studies, the mean and relative error of each parameter were: [R]o, 0.813 +/- (0.11) microM; kb, 2.25 +/- (0.15) microM-1 min-1; F, 0.896 +/- (0.20) liter/min; Ve, 1.67 +/- (0.27) liter; and Vh, 0.228 +/- (0.22) liter. Two unique features of 99mTc-NGA radiopharmacokinetic systems permit the simultaneous estimates of receptor quantity, ligand affinity, and hepatic plasma flow. The first is the ability to administer a quantity of ligand capable of occupying a significant fraction of receptor; and the second is a simple model structure that conserves mass.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic binding protein (HBP) is a hepatocyte-specific receptor for serum asialoglycoproteins. The receptor also recognizes a synthetic glycoprotein that has been developed as a radiopharmaceutical, technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA). This report describes the correlation between receptor parameters measured in vivo via kinetic modeling of 99mTc-NGA and those measured by in vitro radioassay of biopsied liver tissue. Eleven patients with diffuse hepatic disease underwent percutaneous liver biopsy followed by a 99mTc-NGA functional imaging study. In vivo measurements of HBP quantity Ro and forward binding rate constant kb obtained from the kinetic analysis of 99mTc-NGA liver and blood time-activity data were compared to total receptor quantity and the HBP-99mTc-NGA association constant KA as measured by Scatchard binding assay of the biopsied tissue. The correlation coefficients between in vivo and in vitro measurements were 0.73 (df = 8, p = 0.015) and 0.98 (df = 8, p less than 0.01) for Ro and kb, respectively. The in vivo measurements of HBP biochemistry via kinetic analysis of the radiopharmaceutical time-activity data reflect the average concentration and affinity of the receptor. This study further substantiates the validity of 99mTc-NGA as a quantitative probe for the HBP receptor.\r"

We investigated the application in man of a radioiodinated analogue of somatostatin, 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide, which has similar biologic characteristics as the native peptide. The radiopharmaceutical is cleared rapidly from the circulation (up to 85% of the dose after 10 min) mainly by the liver. Liver radioactivity is rapidly excreted into the biliary system. Until 3 hr after injection, radioactivity in the circulation is mainly in the form of 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide. Thereafter, plasma samples contain increasing proportions of free iodide. Similarly, during the first hours after injection, radioactivity in the urine exists mainly in the form of the unchanged peptide. Thereafter, a progressive increase in radioiodide excretion is observed, indicating degradation of the radiopharmaceutical in vivo. Fecal excretion of radioactivity amounts to only a few percent of the dose. The calculated median effective dose equivalent is comparable with values for applications of other 123I-radiopharmaceuticals (0.019 mSv/MBq).\r"

The amount of 14CO2 excreted at 10 min was independent of the rate of gastric emptying and was not quantitatively influenced by the buccal urease activity. The 10-min 14CO2 values discriminated well between Helicobacter pylori positive and negative patients (94% sensitivity, 89% specificity) and correlated with the number of organisms assessed by histology. The test was a good predictor of chronic gastritis (95% sensitivity and 96% specificity), and a quantitative relationship was observed between 14CO2 values and the severity and activity of the gastritis. In H. pylori positive patients, breath 14CO2 was found to be similar in patients with and without ulcer disease, suggesting that the number of bacteria is not a determining factor for the onset of ulceration.\r"

All patients underwent cardiac characterization. Compared to thallium-201 images, visualization of the right ventricle was superior for sestamibi in all cases. After computer masking of the left ventricle, count profiles for each 6-mm right ventricular short-axis slice were extracted and plotted in a bull's-eye type polar map with images normalized to maximal right ventricular counts. On sestamibi right ventricular polar maps, 7 of 11 patients (64%) with right coronary stenosis had fixed or reversible inferior right ventricular defects. None of the 25 volunteers or patients without right coronary stenosis had right ventricular defects (true-negative rate = 100%). We conclude that sestamibi SPECT provides an accurate means to assess right ventricular regional perfusion, with data presentation and interpretation facilitated by the polar map display.\r"

We studied a group of cocaine-dependent polydrug users with 99mTc-HMPAO and high-resolution SPECT and compared their perfusion pattern to cerebral perfusion in a group of older control subjects. Sixteen of 18 cocaine-dependent polydrug users had abnormal perfusion characterized primarily as small focal defects involving inferoparietal, temporal, and anterofrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Psychometric testing was abnormal in all 18 cocaine-dependent subjects. No relation was found between the severity of SPECT abnormalities and mode of administration or frequency or length of cocaine use. All 15 older normal subjects had normal cerebral perfusion. While the focal perfusion abnormalities to the cortex and basal ganglia could be explained by the profound vasoconstrictor effects of cocaine, the combinational use of multiple substances including cannabis and alcohol may play a contributory role. This study documents the high incidence of functional brain abnormalities in cocaine-dependent chronic polydrug users without corresponding abnormalities on imaging studies of cerebral anatomy and morphology.\r"

The low molecular weight fraction of venous plasma separated by fast gel filtration was used as the input function for 11C-methionine studies, and tracer accumulation was analyzed according to Patlak and Gjedde. The average uptake rate of 11C-methionine was 0.0775 +/- 0.0245 min-1 (s.d.) and of FDG 0.0355 +/- 0.0293 min-1, 11C-methionine uptake rate being significantly higher than that of FDG (p less than 0.01). Carbon-11-methionine accumulated strongly in all but one of the lymphomas. FDG accumulated clearly in lymphomas of high-grade malignancy, whereas two intermediate- and three low-grade malignant lymphomas had a poor uptake rate. The tumor/plasma ratio of both 11C-methionine and FDG increased faster in high and intermediate-grade lymphomas than in low-grade lymphomas, but there was considerable overlap between the histologic grades. Carbon-11-methionine seems to be preferable in detecting tumors, while FDG was superior to 11C-methionine in distinguishing the high-grade malignant lymphomas from the other grades.\r"

An uptake index (UI) was calculated by dividing tissue count rates by the integral of plasma count rates. The UI decreased by 45.6% +/- 15.4% (n = 10, p less than 0.001) for normal brain and by 53.2% +/- 14.1% for gliomas (n = 5, p less than 0.01) during AA load compared to basal conditions, while two meningiomas and a metastasis showed only a minor decrease (23.9 +/- 5.7%, n.s.). Two pituitary adenomas could not be delineated on the SPECT scans. These data indicate that IMT competes with naturally-occurring L-amino acids for transport into normal brain and gliomas. Transport characteristics of IMT into tumors of nonglial origin appear to be different from those of gliomas. For both types of tumors, it is advisable to perform IMT-SPECT under fasting conditions.\r"

A final diagnosis was estimated in 51 postoperative patients histologically, the remainder having their final diagnosis gleaned from their medical records. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of morphine-augmented cholescintigraphy in detecting acute cholecystitis was 94.6, 99.1, 97.2, and 98.3%, respectively.

Biodistribution was assessed after intravenous injection of radiolabeled LDL by quantitative analysis of scintigrams, counting of excreta, and counting of tissues at necropsy. Both rabbits and monkeys showed lower renal uptake (123I:99mTc approximately 1:3, as regional percent injected activity corrected for physical decay) and excretion (1:2 to 1:4), but higher hepatic (1.5:1 to 2:1) and cardiac (1.7:1 to 4:1) uptake of 123I than of 99mTc. Adrenals were visualized in normolipemic animals with 123I-tyramine cellobiose-LDL but not with 99mTc-LDL. Hyperlipemic animals showed increased cardiac (up to six-fold) and decreased hepatic activity (by 50%-60%) of both radionuclides.

Uptake of 111In-64C5 and 125I-control-DIG26-11 were compared in 10 clots (7 barium-thrombin and 3 copper-coil) identified in the lungs. There was no difference in the blood clearance of 111In-64C5 and 125I-DIG26-11. Uptake of 111In-64C5 (0.183 +/- 0.105, mean %ID/g) was greater than 125I-DIG26-11 (0.024 +/- 0.025) in pulmonary clots (p less than 0.001). Mean thrombus to blood ratios at 24 hr were 6.78:1 for 64C5 and 0.57:1 for DIG26-11. The clots visualized in vivo were larger (0.315 +/- 0.381 g) than clots not visualized (0.089 +/- 0.098). Negative images were recorded in three dogs with pulmonary emboli, injected with 111In-labeled control monoclonal antibody 3H3. These data suggest that 111In-labeled antifibrin can detect large pulmonary emboli in vivo.\r"

The present case of anaplastic giant-cell carcinoma in an 81-yr-old woman arose in a Hurthle cell tumor. This case illustrates the propensity of Hurthle cell tumor to undergo \"malignant transformation\" and argues for a more aggressive approach to such tumors.\r"

This pharmacologic effect has been applied to hepatobiliary scintigraphy in patients with chronic cholecystitis or cholestasis to reducing the time required for a diagnostic study. However, this feature of narcotics could result in delayed or nonvisualization of the small bowel, simulating a distal common bile duct obstruction, in patients requiring parenteral narcotic analgesics who must undergo hepatobiliary scintigraphy. We report on three patients where administration of intravenous naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan), a narcotic antagonist, was helpful in distinguishing narcotic-induced spasm of the sphincter of Oddi from true obstruction of the common bile duct.\r"

  ".W": "A method for SPECT data acquisition, \"continuous repetitive rotation acquisition,\" was developed with a high-sensitivity three-headed SPECT system. The method was applied to the dynamic imaging of 99mTc-SQ30217, a new myocardial imaging agent. After acquisition and reconstruction of SPECT data every minute, projection images at arbitrary intervals were used for tomographic reconstruction to determine the best timing of SPECT imaging in 99mTc-SQ30217. Based on a comparison of several possible acquisition intervals, SPECT data acquisition within 9 min after injection is recommended because of high myocardial uptake (myocardium-to-lung ratio, 2.83 +/- 0.42 (mean +/- s.e.m.) at 3-6 min) and relatively low hepatic uptake (myocardium-to-liver ratio, 0.85 +/- 0.13 at 3-6 min). The rate constant of the clearance of 99mTc-SQ30217 from the myocardium obtained by SPECT was: k1 = 0.249 +/- 0.050 per min (average half-life = 2.8 min) and k2 = 0.012 +/- 0.004/min (average half-life = 58 min). The continuous repetitive rotation acquisition SPECT study appears useful for imaging SQ30217 with its rapidly changing myocardial distribution.\r"

Approximations such as constant attenuation and mono-exponential scatter functions will not be valid for non-homogeneous regions. A correction method is described where non-uniform density-maps are used in the attenuation correction. Correction for non-uniform scatter is made by a convolution technique based on scatter line-spread functions (SLSF) calculated for different locations inside a clinically realistic, nonhomogeneous, computer phantom. Calculations have been made for a myocardiac source, a uniform source in the lungs and a tumor located in the lungs. Projections were simulated for photon energies corresponding to 201Tl, 99mTc, and 111In. The results show that quantitative images can be obtained in nonhomogeneous regions. An increased contrast has also been demonstrated in the SLSF-corrected images. Comparison with measurements have been made to validate the Monte Carlo code and the scatter and attenuation method.\r"

Matrices are generated using a Monte Carlo code that realistically models a SPECT imaging system. For cold lesions having true contrasts of one, thirty-six combinations of three lesion sizes, three lesion locations, and four projection-data count levels are considered. Both hot and cold, 2-cm-radius lesions having various values of true contrast are studied at a few count levels and lesion locations. With scatter in the matrix, scatter effects are completely removed from the central regions of lesions whose radius is greater than the full width at half maximum of the spatial resolution. Resolution recovery is initially slower but eventually superior. Percent improvements in contrast are greater for lower-contrast cold lesions and higher-contrast hot lesions. In most cases, signal-to-noise ratios are comparable or better. Correct absolute activity levels are obtained.\r"

The prevalence of marijuana use is highest of the illicit drugs being tested. Highly prevalent drugs can be reliably tested. Although it is prudent to rid the workplace of drug use, there is little scientific study on the relationship of drug use and workplace outcomes, such as productivity and safety. Probable-cause testing and preemployment testing are the most common applications. Random testing has been less accepted owing to its higher costs, unresolved legal issues, and predictably poor test reliability. Legal issues have focused on the right to privacy, policy agreements, discrimination, and the lack of due process. The legal cornerstone of a good program is a policy that is planned and agreed on by both labor and management, which serves both as a contract and as a procedure in which expectations and consequences are known. Moreover, NIDA is certifying laboratories doing employee drug testing. Testing methods, when done correctly, are less prone to error than in the past, but screening tests can be defeated by adulterants. Although the incidence of false-positive results is low, such tests are less reliable when the prevalence of drug abuse is also low.\r"

Of course, should workers accept employment in workplaces with prior existent drug-free rules, they have voluntarily submitted those rules, possibly including drug testing, and the explicit sanctions attached to them.\r"

Initial receptor binding studies in dog brain demonstrated that CPA and CGS 21680A were selective for the A1 and A2 adenosine receptor, respectively, whereas NECA displayed slightly greater affinity for A1 than A2 adenosine receptors in the canine brain. Intravenous infusion of CGS 21680A (0.25 and 2.5 micrograms/kg/min) decreased blood pressure (BP) and increased heart rate (HR). CGS 21680A transiently increased renal blood flow (RBF) and either did not change or, at the highest dose infused, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Both urine volume (UV) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) also were decreased by CGS 21680A. At the lowest infusion rate (0.025 micrograms/kg/min) CGS 21680A produced a slowly developing increase in RBF, no change in GFR and a significant decrease in sodium excretion. Intravenous infusion of CPA (15 micrograms/kg/min) lowered BP and HR RBF and GFR. UNaV, UV and renin release also were inhibited by CPA. At a lower infusion rate (2.5 micrograms/kg/min), CPA markedly inhibited UNaV in the absence of a significant change in either BP or renal hemodynamic parameters. Infusion of NECA (0.01 and 0.1 micrograms/kg/min) lowered BP but did not change HR. Furthermore, RBF was increased by NECA, whereas UV and UNaV were inhibited in the absence of a change in GFR. These results may be explained by the relative selectivity of each analog for A1 or A2 adenosine receptors.\r"

CGS 21680A was infused into the left renal artery, while simultaneously measuring blood pressure (BP) and parameters of renal function from both the left and right kidneys. At doses higher than 0.05 micrograms/kg/min, CGS 21680A appeared to leak from the circulation of the infused kidney in pharmacologically significant quantities, inasmuch as BP fell and renal blood flow was increased and renal vascular resistance decreased in the noninfused contralateral kidney. At doses of 0.025 to 0.05 micrograms/kg/min, CGS 21680A appeared localized to the renal circulation, because neither BP nor any measured parameter of contralateral renal function was altered. Intrarenal infusion of 0.025 to 0.05 micrograms/kg/min of CGS 21680A increased renal blood flow but not glomerular filtration rate leading to a fall in the filtration fraction. Urine volume and urinary sodium excretion were unaffected by selective intrarenal infusion of CGS 21680A. Plasma renin activity and renin secretion rate were also not altered significantly by intrarenal infusion of 0.05 micrograms/kg/min of CGS 21680A. In contrast plasma renin activity increased significantly in response to the intrarenal infusion of 0.075 micrograms/kg/min of CGS 21680A, a dose which leaked from the kidney and lowered BP. The results presented suggest that the new adenosine agonist CGS 21680A exerts a direct intrarenal effect on renal hemodynamics, but does not affect urine volume or sodium excretion or directly influence renin release.\r"

CGRP produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of spontaneous tone developed by the arterioles with an EC50 value of 3.9 x 10(-9) M. Calcitonin, as well as substance P, which is frequently colocalized with CGRP, had no effect on arteriolar tone. CGRP also relaxed arterioles contracted with the thromboxane mimetic, U-44619, yielding an EC50 value of 3 x 10(-9) M. The CGRP fragment, human CGRP(8-37), antagonized CGRP-induced relaxation in a noncompetitive manner. Adenylate cyclase activity in single arterioles was stimulated by CGRP, but not by substance P, in a concentration-dependent fashion. Half maximal stimulation occurred at 8 x 10(-9) M, whereas maximum stimulation (2.5-fold over basal) occurred at 10(-7) M. CGRP(8-37) inhibited CGRP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity over a concentration range of 10(-9) to 10(-5) M. The results demonstrate that CGRP stimulates adenylate cyclase activity and is a potent vasodilator of small parenchymal cerebral arterioles in vitro and may play an important role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow.\r"

High K+ (15-50 mM) increased the release of ME-i.r. in a concentration-dependent manner in both regions, the release response in the globus pallidus being consistently greater than in the striatum. This release was highly Ca(++)-dependent and was significantly enhanced in the absence of external Mg++. D-2-Amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (0.5 mM), a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, did not alter this enhanced action of K+, suggesting that the activation of NMDA receptors by an endogenous agonist did not contribute to the enhancement. Exposure of pallidal or striatal slices to four EAA receptor agonists, NMDA, L-glutamate, kainate (KA) and quisqualate, increased the release of ME-i.r. above the base line, an effect that was Ca(++)-dependent. Both L-glutamate and NMDA, at concentrations of 1 and 5 mM, produced a graded increase in the ME-i.r. release, but a higher concentration (10 mM) produced a lower release. In both regions the NMDA (5 mM)-evoked release was effectively inhibited by Mg++ (1.2 mM), 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) (5 microM), a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist and thienylcyclohexylpiperidine (10 microM), a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. Tetrodotoxin (0.3 microM), a Na+ channel blocker, did not affect the NMDA-evoked release of ME-i.r. in the striatum, but decreased it by 52% in the globus pallidus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandins (PG) modulate hepatocyte glucose and lipid metabolism. Hepatocytes rapidly metabolize PG via beta-oxidation, terminating PG action. Clofibrate induces hepatic peroxisomal beta-oxidative activity, for which PG are substrates. To determine the effect of clofibrate-treatment on liver PG metabolism and action, hepatocytes were isolated from rats maintained on a control or clofibrate-supplemented (0.5%) diet for 7 to 9 days. Rates of PG catabolism were determined by high performance liquid chromatography resolution of [3H]PG from [3H]metabolites. Clofibrate treatment enhanced the rates of PGE2, PGF2, and PGD2 degradation by 85%, 278% and 137%, respectively. Rates of PG degradation were correlated with hepatocyte carnitine acetyltransferase activity, a marker of peroxisomal proliferation. Further evidence of enhanced hepatocyte peroxisomal beta-oxidation of PG after clofibrate-treatment was obtained by confirming loss of the 1-position carbon from [1-14C]PGE2 during PGE2 metabolism and failure of the carnitine acyltransferase inhibitor acetyl-DL-aminocarnitine to inhibit PGE2 metabolism. Associated with the faster degradation of PGE2 by hepatocytes from clofibrate-treated rats was loss of inhibition of hepatocyte glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis by exogenous PGE2. Thus, clofibrate's induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation is associated with accelerated catabolism of PG and decreased PG action. Alterations in PG breakdown provide a mechanism for modulating hepatic PG effects.\r"

Within 24 hr, neutrophils and mononuclear cell counts returned to control values, whereas the eosinophilia peaked and persisted up to 96 hr. Treatment with the PAF antagonist BN 52021 [3-(1,1-dimethylethyl)hexahydro-1,4,7b-trihydroxy-8-alpha-methyl-9H-1,7- alpha-(epoxymethanol)1H,6aH-cyclopenta (c) furo (2,3-5) (3',2':3,4) cyclopenta (1,2-d) furan-5,9,12(4H)trione)] (5-20 micrograms/cavity) or with dexamethasone (1-50 micrograms/cavity) inhibited the early (6 hr) and late (24 hr) pleural eosinophil accumulation induced by PAF. Dexamethasone, but not BN 52021, was still effective in inhibiting the late eosinophilia if administered 5 hr after the lipid, suggesting that the delayed eosinophilia may involve a secondary mechanism, still responsive to the glucocorticoid, but independent of PAF itself. The coinjection of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or of the inhibitor of mRNA synthesis DNA-dependent actinomycin D selectively suppressed the eosinophil mobilization at 24 hr. Transfer of the cell-free 6-hr PAF pleural washing from donor to normal recipient rats led to a selective and delayed pleural eosinophilia. This activity was destroyed by heating (+100 degrees C) or freezing (-20 degrees C) the material recovered from the donor pleural fluid. Treatment of donors, but not recipients, with either BN 25021, dexamethasone, actinomycin D or cycloheximide inhibited the late eosinophil accumulation triggered by transferred PAF pleural washing, indicating that the generation of this eosinophilotactic activity, but not its effects, is suppressed by those agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91259429\r", 
  ".W": "The contractile response of the rat caudal artery to field stimulation occurred in two phases; an initial rapidly developing contraction (phasic) and a subsequent more slowly developing contraction (tonic). Phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible antagonist, and prazosin, a competitive antagonist at the alpha-1 adrenoceptor, nonselectively inhibited both contractile phases. Ryanodine, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium release, selectively inhibited the phasic component, whereas nifedipine, a membrane calcium channel blocker, selectively inhibited the tonic component. These data demonstrate that both contractile phases are mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptors and the phases are distinguished by the calcium source mobilized; intracellular stores of calcium are mobilized during the phasic component and extracellular calcium is mobilized during the tonic component. Inasmuch as alpha-1 adrenoceptors on nonvascular smooth muscle may be divided into alpha-1A and alpha-1B subtypes based on ability to open membrane calcium channels or ability to stimulate intracellular calcium release, respectively, we characterized the alpha-1 adrenoceptor mediating the contraction to determine whether a specific subtype was coupled to each phase. WB4101, a marginally alpha-1A adrenoceptor selective antagonist, 5-methyl-urapidil, a highly alpha-1A adrenoceptor selective antagonist and chloroethylclonidine, a highly alpha-1B adrenoceptor selective antagonist, all inhibited both contractile phases. These findings indicate that endogenous norepinephrine contracts the rat caudal artery via alpha-1 adrenoceptors that mobilize both the release of intracellular calcium and the influx of calcium through membrane channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The PI response elicited by ET-1 was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca++, but was not reduced by organic (nisoldipine, nimodipine) or inorganic (Co++, Mn++) calcium channel blockers. Pretreatment of granule cells with tetrodotoxin or amiloride failed to affect the response to ET-1. Extracellular sodium depletion resulted in a marked increase in basal PI turnover; however, the net increase of PI turnover induced by ET-1 was unchanged. ET-induced PI breakdown could be partially inhibited by short or long term treatment with phorbol dibutyrate but was unaffected by pertussis toxin. ET- and S6b-induced PI turnover were dependent on the culturing time of granule cells, with the maximal response in a 4-day culture. The ET- and S6b-induced PI turnover appeared to be additive to that induced by carbachol, histamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate and maitotoxin. However, the responses induced by ET and S6b were nonadditive. Prestimulation of cells with ET or S6b for 30 sec to 24 hr resulted in dramatic loss of the ability of ET and S6b to stimulate PI hydrolysis, without affecting subsequent responsiveness induced by other stimuli, indicating homologous desensitization for ET- and S6b-induced responses. Moreover, our results further support the notion that ET and S6b act on the same population of receptors in cerebellar granule cells.\r"

  ".W": "With the use of the shock-induced suppression of water drinking in thirsty rats (Vogel's conflict paradigm) and the pentylenetetrazole-enhanced shock-induced suppression of drinking (proconflict paradigm) as animal models to test anxiolytic and antipanic agents, it was possible to distinguish two major classes of benzodiazepines (BZDs) and congeners on the basis of their antiproconflict index (ratio of anticonflict/antiproconflict potencies). Thus, typical low potency BZDs and congeners (diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem, alpidem) with anxiolytic/hypnotic properties have a low antiproconflict index (close to 1), whereas typical high potency BZDs (clonazepam, alprazolam, bretazenil) with reported antipanic properties have an antiproconflict index approximately 10-fold higher. The anticonflict and antiproconflict actions of BZDs with low or high antiproconflict indices are blocked by flumazenil but are potentiated differentially by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake blocker 1-2-[bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-methoxyethyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3- pyridine-carboxylic acid. Protracted administration of antianxiety and antipanic antidepressant drugs that do not act on GABAA receptors, directly, resulted in anticonflict and antiproconflict effects. However, the efficacy of these drugs is clearly inferior (20-30%) to that of BZDs. These data suggest that specific GABAA receptor subtypes mediate the pharmacological action of BZDs possessing low and high antiproconflict indices.\r"

  ".W": "The present study has investigated the direct opioid delta receptor-mediated antinociception produced by i.c.v. administration of the highly selective delta agonists, [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) and [D-Ala2]deltorphin II, as well as that of the less delta-selective [D-Ser2,Leu5,Thr6]enkephalin (DSLET), by using two novel nonequilibrium opioid antagonists, [D-Ala2,Leu5,Cys6] enkephalin (DALCE) and naltrindole 5'-isothiocyanate (5'-NTII). At times ranging from 8 to 48 hr after a single i.c.v. pretreatment of mice with 5'-NTII, the antinociceptive effects of [D-Ala2] deltorphin II were significantly antagonized. In contrast, 5'-NTII pretreatment at times between 10 min and 24 hr failed to antagonize the antinociceptive effects of DPDPE. Previous studies have shown that pretreatment with i.c.v. DALCE produces a dose- and time-related antagonism of DPDPE, but not morphine, antinociception. However, pretreatment with i.c.v. DALCE failed to antagonize the antinociceptive effects of [D-Ala2]deltorphin II. Similarly, i.c.v. administration of DSLET produced time- and dose-related antinociception which was partially antagonized by either beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA) or by ICI 174,864 (N,N-dialyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH), suggesting mixed activity at mu and delta receptors. ICI 174,864 produced essentially complete antagonism of DSLET antinociception in beta-FNA-pretreated mice. Pretreatment with 5'-NTII (at -8 to -48 hr), blocked the antinociception produced by DSLET in control or in beta-FNA-pretreated mice. In contrast, pretreatment with DALCE failed to antagonize the antinociception produced by i.c.v. DSLET in either control or in beta-FNA-pretreated mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

BC 264, a highly selective CCK-B receptor agonist, did not decrease consumption of a palatable meal when administered either i.p. or into the lateral ventricles of the brain, whereas CCK decreased feeding when administered i.p. at the same doses. CCK decreased feeding when administered i.v.t. at a high dose, 5 micrograms.

To estimate the quantity of i.v.t. administered CCK which reached the periphery, a tracer of radiolabeled [3H]p-CCK8 ([3H]CCK octapeptide sulfate), combined with unlabeled pCCK8 (5 micrograms) was administered i.c.t. Thirty minutes after administration, intact radiolabeled pCCK8 was extracted from the plasma and measured in the blood in nanomolar concentrations, exceeding the amounts of CCK octapeptide sulfate reported previously to be present in the plasma after a meal. Intraventricularly administered CCK thus appears to reduce feeding in the rat through a mechanism involving a CCK-A receptor subtype in the periphery.\r"

These receptors were: 1) the postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors which signal the suppressant effect of microiontophoretically applied NE on the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons; 2) the postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors which mediate the short-latency suppressant effect of endogenous NE, released by the electrical stimulation of the locus ceruleus (LC), on the firing activity of these same neurons; 3) the postsynaptic beta adrenoceptors which mediate the long-latency excitatory effect of LC stimulation on hippocampus pyramidal neurons; 4) the alpha-2 autoreceptors located on NE terminals in the hippocampus; and 5) the alpha-2 autoreceptors located on the cell body of LC NE neurons. The suppressant effect of microiontophoretic applications of NE on dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons was not changed by the long-term DMI treatments. The recovery time of the firing activity of these neurons after microiontophoretic application of NE, an index of the activity of the NE reuptake process, was the same in control and DMI-treated rats. However, the prolongation of this recovery time by the acute i.v. administration of DMI reached a plateau at a lower cumulative dose in long-term DMI-treated than in control rats. These results thus suggest that long-term administration of DMI did not affect the function of the NE transporter but reduced the number of DMI binding sites. The effectiveness of the 1 Hz stimulation of the LC in suppressing of the firing activity of pyramidal neurons was unchanged by either long-term DMI treatment (5 or 10 mg/kg/day), whereas that of the 5 Hz stimulation was enhanced only in rats on the 10-mg/kg regimen. This suggests that the function of terminal alpha-2 autoreceptors was decreased after this latter DMI regimen, because the reduction of the efficacy of the stimulation obtained by increasing the frequency from 1 to 5 Hz has been shown to be due to the activation of terminal alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptors. In keeping with this interpretation, the reduction of the effectiveness of the stimulation of the LC by the systemic administration of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was attenuated in rats treated with the 10-mg/kg/day regimen of DMI, but not in those with the 5-mg/kg/day regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Concurrent administration of morphine sulfate i.c.v. and i.t. produces a multiplicative interaction for analgesia in the tail flick response in mice. This interaction decreases to an additive interaction in mice which are tolerant to s.c. morphine. To test the responses of opioids selective for mu or delta receptors, the present study examined the interactions between fentanyl citrate (mu agonist) and D-Ala2-D-Leu5 enkephalin (DADLE, a relatively selective delta agonist) administered i.c.v. and i.t. using the tail flick test in control and morphine pellet-implanted mice. A method was developed for assigning statistical significance to the resulting ED50 values when analyzed isobolographically. When fentanyl or DADLE was administered i.c.v. plus i.t., an additive interaction between sites occurred in control animals, which changed to an antagonistic interaction for fentanyl and a multiplicative interaction for DADLE after morphine pellet treatment. When morphine was given i.c.v. along with i.t. fentanyl or DADLE in control animals, multiplicative interactions occurred when equipotent doses were given. Thus, opioids which were more receptor-selective than morphine did not produce multiplicative interactions, but were multiplicative when given with morphine. These results suggest that activation of combinations of receptors (by morphine) was required for the multiplicative interaction. The supraspinal site involved mu receptors (which are not self-sufficient and require an additional component) and the spinal site involved mu or delta receptors. The use of isobolographic analysis required that the drugs, when administered concurrently at two sites, be given in a constant dose ratio.\r"

The maximum contractile responses (Emax) to norepinephrine, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline and UK 14,304 were of similar magnitude and were significantly greater than the contractile responses to clonidine. The rank order of the ED50 values for these drugs was: oxymetazoline less than UK 14,304 much less than clonidine = norepinephrine = phenylephrine. Prazosin (10(-8) M) shifted the concentration-response curves to phenylephrine and UK 14,304 to the right, but did not shift the concentration-response curves to clonidine and oxymetazoline. Yohimbine (10(-7) M) shifted the concentration-response curves to clonidine, oxymetazoline and UK 14,304 to the right, but did not shift the concentration-response curve to phenylephrine. The ED50 values for phenylephrine and clonidine were smaller in the older than in the younger age group. There were no other age-dependent differences in the response to agonists. Pretreatment with chlorethylclonidine, which selectively alkylates the alpha-1B subtype, did not affect the Emax value of phenylephrine-induced contractions, but significantly shifted the curve to the right. The ratios of the Emax values in Ca++ free buffer to that in normal Ca++ buffer for phenylephrine, UK 14,304, clonidine, oxymetazoline and KCl were 0.30, 0.38, 0.08, 0.07 and 0, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The potency of Sn-diiododeuteroporphyrin inhibition of bilirubin production in vivo is similar to that of Sn-protoporphyrin, but in vitro tests demonstrate that, when in solution with human serum albumin, Sn-diiododeuteroporphyrin is significantly (3-10 times, depending upon conditions) less photosensitizing than are Sn-protoporphyrin or Sn-mesoporphyrin.

Both 246- and 90-pS channels are Ca++ sensitive, but the 90-pS channel was more sensitive at a membrane potential near the resting state. In whole cell recordings, spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) were observed. The STOCs arose from opening of Ca(++)-activated K+ channels. Removal of extracellular Ca++ did not eliminate STOCs. Decreasing intracellular free Ca++ with 10 mM EGTA markedly reduced STOC amplitudes. Single channel currents with a conductance similar to that of the large conductance Ca(++)-activated K+ channel were observed in whole cell recordings. The amplitude distribution for STOCs provides evidence that two populations of STOC events occur. The small STOC events were present at all membrane voltages. The large STOC events became more evident at more depolarized potentials (0 mV). We conclude that near the resting membrane potential, the small STOCs arise from opening of smaller conductance Ca(++)-activated K+ channels. As the cell is depolarized, the large STOCs arise due to opening of large conductance Ca(++)-activated K+ channels.\r"

  ".W": "We previously showed that M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors in dissociated cells of the adult rat cortex couple to phosphoinositide (Pl) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) metabolism, respectively. To further classify these receptors according to probable subtype, we have employed a group of selective muscarinic antagonists to obtain pharmacological profiles of the cortical M1 and M2 receptors, and to compare them with the muscarinic receptors in N1E-115 cells, which contain M1 receptors mediating cyclic GMP elevation and M4 receptors inhibiting cAMP levels. The M2-mediated inhibition of cAMP levels in cortex was blocked by 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) with higher potency (0.29 nM) than for reported potency in cardiac tissue (approximately 10 nM), indicating that this cortical response is probably not mediated by the m2 gene product. Similarly, the potency of hexahydrosiladiphenidol (HSD) at the cortical M2 receptor (159 nM) was somewhat greater than the reported potency in cardiac tissue (295 nM). The cardioselective drugs AF-DX 116 and methoctramine blocked the cortical M2 response less potently (135 nM and 229 nM, respectively) than would be expected for involvement of the m2 gene product. Thus, the potencies of AF-DX 116, methoctramine, 4-DAMP and HSD suggest that the cortical M2 response, like the striatal M2 receptor, is mediated by a noncardiac M2 receptor, perhaps by the m4 gene product. This postulate was supported by the significant correlations between cortical and striatal M2 receptors as compared to the M4 receptor in N1E-115 cells (r = 0.92 and 0.99, respectively, P less than .025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous reports implicate L-arginine or N alpha-substituted arginine compounds as precursors of EDRF. Employing a microassay for the measurement of O2- production by rabbit aortic rings, which is based on the established method of reduction of cytochrome c by O2-, we studied the interaction between O2- and EDRF using L-arginine, an N-substituted arginine compound, namely, N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE), sodium nitroprusside and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), a putative specific inhibitor of EDRF synthesis. Measurements of O2- production were made under basal conditions and upon stimulation with alloxan, the diabetogenic, O(2-)-generating compound. Both BAEE, an EDRF-generating agent (0.3 and 3.0 mM) and sodium nitroprusside, an NO-generating compound (1.7 and 3.4 microM), significantly reduced alloxan-stimulated O2- production, but L-arginine (0.6-3.0 mM) paradoxically increased O2- generation. NMMA (1.0 mM) blocked the inhibitory effect of BAEE on O2- production in an endothelium-dependent manner. Because NMMA is an inhibitor of EDRF, these results suggest that BAEE, but not L-arginine, reduces O2- produced by the endothelium of the rabbit aorta through a mechanism involving EDRF generation.\r"

  ".W": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reportedly can scavenge superoxide anion (O2-), a property attributed to its sulfhydryl group. The present investigation, using rabbit aortic rings precontracted with either norepinephrine or clonidine, was designed to determine whether captopril possesses an endothelium-dependent component of vasodilation related to its ability to protect endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from superoxide-mediated destruction. Also studied were enalaprilat, a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor, superoxide dismutase, and the sulfhydryl compounds glutathione (GSH), N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Captopril, but not enalaprilat, caused dose-dependent relaxations in preconstricted aortic rings containing an intact endothelium. Rings denuded of endothelium were unresponsive to any dose of captopril. Captopril's vasodilation was not related to prostaglandin influence but was associated with an increase in cyclic GMP. Superoxide dismutase, GSH, MPG and NAC also produced endothelium-dependent relaxations similar to captopril. It was also demonstrated that endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were enhanced by captopril, GSH, MPG and NAC but not by enalaprilat. In another set of experiments, the ability of captopril to inhibit superoxide-mediated inactivation of EDRF was examined. Pyrogallol, a potent generator of O2-, and superoxide dismutase, a scavenger of O2-, were used as a basis for comparing a possible scavenging effect of captopril. In preconstricted rings, pyrogallol elicited endothelium-dependent contractions that were attenuated by both captopril and superoxide dismutase. Similar effects were found with GSH, MPG and NAC but not with enalaprilat. These results suggest that captopril's endothelium-dependent vasodilation is due to its sulfhydryl group and the ability of the latter to scavenge O2-, thereby protecting EDRF.\r"

  ".W": "The novel competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (CGP 37849) was found to produce a phencyclidine (PCP)-like behavioral syndrome (ataxia, locomotion, stereotypies) in amygdala-kindled rats, whereas the amphetamine-like behavioral alterations of the syndrome (locomotion, stereotypies) were only infrequently seen in nonkindled rats. In dose-response experiments in kindled and nonkindled rats, behavioral effects were scored using a ranked intensity scale, and the behaviors and behavioural scores determined after CGP 37849 were compared with those determined after i.p. administration of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (MK-801). In kindled rats, 20 mg/kg of CGP 37849 produced about the same scores for hyperlocomotion and head weaving as 0.1 mg/kg of MK-801. Kindled rats exhibited higher behavioral scores than nonkindled rats, especially in the case of CGP 37849. The behavioral effects produced by CGP 37849 in kindled rats were almost indistinguishable from the PCP-like behavioral effects induced by MK-801, indicating that CGP 37849 indeed produces a PCP-like pattern of behavior in kindled rats. Hyperlocomotion and head weaving induced by CGP 37849 in kindled rats could be attenuated or totally prevented by pretreatment with ipsapirone, a partial agonist/antagonist at postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors of the 5-HT1A subtype. Furthermore, these behavioural effects were attenuated or blocked by the dopamine antagonist haloperidol and the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. The data demonstrate that kindling induces a hypersensitivity to PCP-like behavioral effects of competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, which could relate to the recent finding of increased function of NMDA receptors following kindling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both U69,593 and bremazocine produced antinociception in the warm water tail-flick test after i.c.v. administration. Pretreatment with the kappa antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine, at doses shown not to affect [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin- (mu-agonist) or [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (delta-agonist)-induced antinociception, significantly attenuated the effects of U69,593 and bremazocine, suggesting actions of these agonists at kappa receptors. Furthermore, beta-funaltrxamine (mu antagonist) and ICI 174,864 [N,N,-diallyl-Tyr-(alpha-aminoisobutyric acid)2-Phe-Leu-OH] (delta antagonist), had no effect on U69,593 or bremazocine in this test providing further evidence of kappa receptor-mediated activity. Pretreatment with (-)-UPHIT produced no effect alone and a long-lasting (up to 48 hr) antagonism of U69,593, but not bremazocine, antinociception. The antagonist actions of (-)-UPHIT did not alter the antinociceptive effects of [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin or [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin. These data suggest that (-)-UPHIT is a selective, long-lasting kappa antagonist which can differentially antagonize the antinociception produced by these two kappa agonists.

MEN 10,207 exhibited antagonism only at doses which produced agonist effects.

At these NK-2-selective blocking doses, MEN 10,376: 1) did not affect urodynamic parameters at cystometry in normal rats but reduced amplitude of micturition contractions following induction of chemical (intravesical xylene) cystitis and 2) reduced by a maximum of 50% the noncholinergic bronchoconstrictor response to vagal nerve stimulation.

  ".U": "91259447\r", 
  ".W": "In rat cerebellar slices, depolarization with 35 mM KCl caused increase of cyclic GMP (cGMP) production. This increase was Ca(++)-dependent, similar to the K(+)-evoked release of glutamate and aspartate in the same preparation. The K(+)-induced cGMP formation was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (maximal inhibition 60-70%; IC50 = 0.019 microM) indicating the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors probably activated by excitatory amino acids (EAAs) released by K(+)-depolarization. The cGMP production evoked by high-K+ was also potently inhibited by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; IC50 = 0.42 nM) or by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; IC50 = 1 nM). Methiothepin prevented the action of both 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT. These data suggest the involvement of 5-HT1-like receptors. When added alone to the depolarized slices, methiothepin (0.03-3 microM) produced a concentration-dependent increase of cGMP suggesting that the 5-HT1-like receptors may be physiologically activated by the endogenous transmitter. Endogenous 5-HT released by (+)-fenfluramine (1 microM) or remaining in the biophase due to reuptake inhibition by citalopram (1 microM) caused reduction of cGMP compatible with a close apposition between 5-HT and EAA terminals. It can be concluded that activation (either direct or indirect) or blockade of presynaptic 5-HT1-like receptors previously found to be sited on EAA terminals in rat cerebellum where they mediate decrease of EAA release may profoundly affect the postsynaptic response elicited by EAA receptors coupled to guanylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "The relative effects of drugs which elevate cytosolic cyclic AMP on inotropy and diastolic relaxation (lusitropy) of guinea pig atria were quantified in vitro. There was a temporal difference between these responses in that inotropy reached peak response considerably faster than lusitropy. Also, although the relaxation response was sustained to an elevated steady state, the inotropic responses to beta adrenoceptor agonists were transient and returned to base line over 90 min. However, the inotropic responses to forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP) were sustained. For all of the drugs tested, the lusitropic response was at least 4 times more sensitive than the inotropic response (i.e., the concentration response curve for relaxation was shifted to the left of the curve for inotropy). In the case of beta adrenoceptor agonists, these differences were greater, presumably because of the fading inotropic response over 90 min. It was found that although high efficacy beta adrenoceptor agonists such as isoproterenol (and the direct activator of adenylate cyclase forskolin) produced both inotropy and lusitropy, lower efficacy agonists produced predominant lusitropy. The low efficacy agonist prenalterol produced insignificant inotropy but 60% maximal lusitropy. These data were modeled mathematically by a \"differential coupling model\" which assumed that a uniform cytosolic level of elevated cAMP activated two biochemical processes of differing sensitivity. Thus, the lusitropic response (phosphorylation of phospholamban) was coupled more efficiently to the cAMP response than the inotropic response (phosphorylation of calcium channels). A second model (\"differential messenger concentration model\") which calculated the effects of a compartmentalization of cAMP concentration within the cardiac cell by restricted diffusion and/or selective degradation by phosphodiesterases also was used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both morphine and DTLET depressed the neuronal responses in a dose-related fashion, with the former requiring lower doses. Although dibencozide alone was devoid of any effect, it significantly enhanced the depressive effects of all doses of morphine tested and of the lower two doses of DTLET. It is concluded that dibencozide enhances the spinal depression of nociceptive information elicited by mu and delta opioid agonists. This drug could provide a useful tool for the study of interactions between opioids and opioids receptors. It is also suggested that dibencozide could be useful in clinical practice for reducing the dosage of opioids.\r"

The tumor Pt levels after ThLip administration were increased in response to HT. The targeting index was approximately 3. The antitumor activity of ThLip + HT, as measured by tumor growth delay or tumor weight inhibition, was larger than that of ThLip without HT or a solution with or without HT. The CDDP dose in ThLip + HT to give equivalent tumor growth delay in solution (40 micrograms/mouse) + HT was about 10 micrograms/mouse, and therefore the targeted drug delivery enhancement ratio was about 4. The ratio correlates with the targeting index. The blood urea nitrogen level, as an indicator of CDDP nephrotoxicity, was increased 7 days after the administration of ThLip (40 micrograms CDDP/mouse) with HT. However, this blood urea nitrogen level rise was independent of the activity enhancement by the liposome. These findings suggest that the HT combined CDDP delivery system using ThLip can decrease the effective CDDP dose, thereby increasing its therapeutic index.\r"

  ".W": "The relative potencies of the argininolytic agents NG-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMA), NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and NG-amino-L-arginine (L-NAA) were assayed by their inhibitory effect on both basal and stimulated release of endothelium-derived NO in vitro and in vivo. Basal NO release was indirectly assessed by the ability of the analogs to contract phenylephrine-preconstricted rat aortic rings and their ability to produce a hypertensive response in awake, unanesthetized normotensive rats. In aortic rings, the three analogs induced vasocontraction and inhibited the vasorelaxation mediated by ACh-stimulated endothelial NO release. In this latter assay, L-NNA was 30 times more potent than either L-NMA or L-NAA. In free-moving rats, the agents caused dose-dependent increases in arterial pressure due to the blockade of endogenous NO formation. Dose-response analysis indicated that L-NNA was 87 and 230 times more potent than L-NMA and L-NAA, respectively. Pretreatment with L-NNA was also found to selectively inhibit, but not abolish, the depressor effects of acetylcholine in unanesthetized and phenylephrine- or vasopressin-infused normotensive-pithed rats. These studies indicate that L-NNA is a potent antagonist of endothelium-derived relaxing factor formation in vitro and in vivo. The contractile and hypertensive effects of the argininolytic agents clearly demonstrates that a continuous basal release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/NO occurs in both isolated vascular rings and whole animals.\r"

Of the antibodies tested, two (422F11 and 420G11) were found that recognized a class of high affinity [3H]nicotine binding sites present on neuronal cells, but not on glia. The binding properties and pharmacological specificity of these sites compared well with those determined previously for putative nicotinic cholinergic receptors in adult rat brain. The binding of [3H]nicotine to neuronal receptors was effectively inhibited by both antibodies. Receptor-bearing cells were identified using indirect immunofluorescence. Approximately 20 to 30% of the cells were labeled specifically by the anti-idiotypes. Labeling was blocked by L-nicotine and other nicotinic agonists, but not by antagonists or by alpha and neuronal bungarotoxins. The majority of cells which were labeled had either bipolar or pyramidal morphology. Fluorescent labeling was associated with cell bodies as well as with axonal and dendritic processes, consistent with the proposed roles of neuronal nicotinic receptors in neuromodulation and synaptic transmission. The results suggest that anti-idiotypic antibodies may provide a new tool suitable for studying the locations, structure and functional significance of high affinity neuronal nicotinic receptors at the cellular level.\r"

  ".W": "The imidazobenzodiazepinone Ro 15-4513 has been shown previously to bind to central benzodiazepine receptors as well as to a second, uncharacterized class of sites that do not bind diazepam, differentiating them from the normal benzodiazepine-binding site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A (GABAA) receptor. This study describes the characterization of these unique diazepam-insensitive (DZ-IS) sites. Ro 15-4513 binding to DZ-IS sites was abundant in cerebellum from cow, rat and human and detectable in cortex, hippocampus and striatum by autoradiography on rat brain sections. These sites represented approximately 20% of the total binding in bovine cerebellar membranes, but only 2 to 3% of the total in cortex. Ro 15-4513 binds with the same affinity (Kd approximately 4.5 nM) to both diazepam-sensitive and DZ-IS sites in the cerebellum. A number of compounds which bind to the classical benzodiazepine receptors also bind to the DZ-IS sites. These compounds include: the pyrazoloquinoline CGS 8216, the beta-carbolines methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, ZK 95962, ZK 94326 and ZK 93126, as well as the classical benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788. Besides binding diazepam poorly, the DZ-IS sites demonstrate a very low affinity for other benzodiazepines. Ligands which bind to the various drug receptor sites on the GABA receptor complex do not directly modulate the binding of Ro 15-4513 to DZ-IS sites nor does ethanol. However, antagonism of Ro 15-4513 binding to the DZ-IS sites by methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and by CGS 8216 is modulated by the presence of GABA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SK&F R-105058 is an N-ethyl carbamate ester prodrug of the selective DA1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam, which, on oral administration to dogs, results in sustained plasma levels of the renal vasodilator, fenoldopam. Treatment of 6 dogs with SK&F R-105058 (10 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) resulted in a significant attenuation of the amphotericin B-induced reductions in creatinine clearance observed on days 2 and 3 after initiation of amphotericin treatment. However, the increase in urine flow and fractional sodium excretion induced by amphotericin B was not altered by SK&F R-105058 treatment. Subsequent histological analysis of the kidneys demonstrated lesions consisting of multifocal tubular degeneration, necrosis and mineralization of mostly distal tubules. Quantitation of tubular lesions indicated that SK&F R-105058 significantly reduced the morphological changes induced by amphotericin B. The data indicate that administration of a fenoldopam prodrug can delay amphotericin B-induced reductions in glomerular filtration rate in the dog.\r"

Longitudinal muscle contractions, evoked by single transmural electrical stimuli, were inhibited by EM (10-300 microM) with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 161 microM (EC50). EM-induced inhibition of longitudinal muscle contractions was not affected by the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine (0.3 microM), by the adrenergic neuronal blocker, guanethidine (10 microM), or the opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone (1.0 microM). Bethanechol-induced longitudinal muscle contractions were also reduced by EM. Noncholinergic longitudinal muscle contractions (1 microM scopolamine present), induced by trains of transmural stimuli, were reduced by EM (EC50, 142 microM); substance P (a mediator of noncholinergic contractions)-induced contractions were also reduced by EM. Circular muscle contractions, evoked by brief trains of transmural stimulation, were inhibited by EM but bethanechol- and substance P-induced contractions of the circular muscle were not altered by EM. Segments (2 cm) of small intestine were used to study reflex circular muscle contractions evoked by distention of the segment aboral to the recording point. Reflex contractions were inhibited by EM (EC50, 84 microM). These data indicate that, in the guinea pig small intestine, EM inhibits nerve-mediated contractions by actions on enteric nerves and on longitudinal but not circular muscle.\r"

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 252: 1108-1116, 1990), is described in human brain. Saturation analysis of the binding of [125I]epidepride to membranes derived from striatum and regions of cortex demonstrated similar Kd values (34 and 28-33 pM, respectively) but differing maximum density of binding site values (152 and 3-8 fmol/mg of protein, respectively). The pharmacological profile of binding in cortex was also similar to striatum (epidepride greater than spiperone greater than butaclamol = flupenthixol greater than clozapine) except that an additional low-affinity site, blocked by the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist idazoxan, was present in cortex. Quantification by autoradiography also demonstrated the greatest binding in the basal ganglia, with the striatum exhibiting greater binding than the pallidal complex or midbrain regions. For the pallidum, binding in the external segment was higher than the internal segment. Within the midbrain the binding of [125I]epidepride correlated well with the known distribution of DA-containing cell bodies, with the substantia nigra (pars compacta and pars lateralis) and ventral tegmental area (A10) higher than area A8 and central gray. Binding in frontal and parietal cortex was highest in the internal layers (layers V and VI). Temporal cortex showed a 2-fold higher density of binding than other cortical regions and a trilaminar pattern; binding was greater in the external (layers I and II) and internal layers than in the middle layers (III and IV). This pattern changed in the parahippocampal complex. Within the lateral occipitotemporal cortex, binding was densest in layers I to III and very low in layers IV to VI, but binding was almost nonexistent in the adjacent entorhinal cortex. Within the hippocampal complex, binding was evident in the subiculum, CA3 and dentate gyrus and almost nonexistent in the presubiculum or other fields of the hippocampus. This pattern of binding in the parahippocampal gyrus is unique to human brain and represents sites of action for DA in limbic cortex.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the relationship between cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and anti-ischemic efficacy of several structurally different ACE inhibitors or their prodrug esters perfused through the isolated rat heart. Seven ACE inhibitors inhibited cardiac ACE to varying degrees due to differences in uptake during perfusion through nonischemic rat hearts. Zofenopril-sulfhydryl and fosinoprilic acid were the most effective of the free inhibitors. Among the prodrugs, zofenopril and S-benzoylcaptopril, hydrolyzed rapidly by cardiac esterase, were more effective than their component ACE-inhibitors, whereas fosinopril, ramipril and enalapril were poorly active. For studies in ischemic rat hearts, vehicle or drug treatment was initiated 10 min before a 25-min period of global ischemia and during a 30-min reperfusion period. Of five unesterified ACE inhibitors studied for anti-ischemic activity, only captopril and zofenopril-sulfhydryl were found to improve postischemic contractile function and reduce cell death in the isolated rat hearts. Fosinoprilic acid, ramiprilat and enalaprilat were not cardioprotective at high perfusion concentrations, despite the fact that nearly complete inhibition of cardiac ACE was achieved with all of the compounds studied. The S-benzoyl prodrugs of zofenopril-sulfhydryl and captopril were at least as potent as their component ACE inhibitors in reducing ischemic-reperfusion damage in the same model. Neither zofenopril nor captopril, however, had any effect on coronary flow before or after ischemia. Thus, it appears that the cardioprotective effects of zofenopril and captopril are independent of cardiac ACE inhibition or, at least, that ACE inhibition alone is not sufficient. Both captopril and zofenopril are sulfhydryl-containing compounds whereas the inactive compounds are not; and, thus, this group appears to be important in mediating their cardioprotective actions.\r"
