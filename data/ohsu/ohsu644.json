Comparison of IM to nitrocellulose (NC) has shown the following advantages: (a) better retention of total HIV antigens, (b) improved detection of antibodies to glycosylated envelope antigens, and (c) ease of membrane handling. As a direct result of these improvements, less HIV antigen is required for detection of HIV antibodies in immunoblotting using the IM. Additionally, in some cases, HIV infection can be confirmed earlier due to enhanced detectability of the envelope antigens. Sera from 444 subjects including 4 seroconversions and 4 AIDS patients were investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one episodes of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were treated with corticosteroids in the form of intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone. A standard dose of 80 mg/day x 5 days was given for 15 episodes, whereas 6 patients received variable doses of 20-120 mg/day x 4-20 days. All were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Comparison was made with 12 AIDS patients with PCP who were not treated with steroids. The steroid group was more severely ill than the controls as measured by alveolar-arterial oxygen difference but were otherwise comparable. Mortality from the pneumonia in the steroid group was 2/21 (10%) vs. 3/12 (25%) in the control group. Significant differences were seen in the following parameters: time to defervescence (1 day vs. greater than 9.3 days), the proportion of patients with pO2 greater than 70 mm Hg at day 5 [12/21 (57%) vs. 1/12 (9%)] and at day 10 [19/21 (90%) vs. 7/12 (58%)], and number of adverse drug reactions [4/21 (19%) vs. 9/12 (75%)]. There were fewer late relapses [1/19 (5%) vs. 2/9 (22%)] after a 5.5 month (mean) follow-up. All patients had improvements in their clinical status when initially given corticosteroid therapy but early relapses occurred when steroids were discontinued in five patients (24%). No other complications could be attributed to steroid therapy in this study. A brief course of high-dose corticosteroids appears to be beneficial in severely ill AIDS patients with pneumocystis pneumonia. This suggests the need for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to confirm these findings.\r"

Seventeen patients had glioblastoma, two had high-grade oligodendroglioma, and one patient had two metastatic sarcoma lesions. LAK cells were produced from blood mononuclear cells (MNC) obtained by 2 to 3 leukapheresis procedures and cultured (2.5 x 10(6) MNC/ml) 3 to 5 days with 1000 units rIL-2/ml. Although LAK cells could be produced from MNC of all patients, those taking steroids or with a low Karnofsky functional status generated, on average, suboptimal LAK cell activity. Age, sex, and serum anticonvulsant levels do not seem to influence a patient's ability to produce LAK cells in vitro. For therapy, cultured MNC (1-15 x 10(9] containing LAK cells were suspended in saline containing 10(6) units rIL-2 and injected into tissue surrounding the tumor cavity during craniotomy. For 3 days after their operations, patients received 10(6) units rIL-2 into the tumor cavity through an Ommaya reservoir. The treatment protocol was tolerated well by all patients, although they all experienced some degree of headache, fever, or lethargy that cleared within a few days of the last rIL-2 injection. When computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained soon after treatment, areas of low density suggested a greater-than-normal extent of edema around the operative site. At the present time, CT scans indicate that the tumors of seven patients have recurred with an average disease-free interval of 25 +/- 6 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 16 of 23 (70%) procedures, the heart rate fell abruptly to 60 or less, by a mean of 38%. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased transiently by 31% during 12 of 23 (55%) procedures. Our findings of transient bradycardia and hypotension upon mechanical stimulation or compression of the mandibular nerve or trigeminal ganglion show for the first time the presence of a trigeminal depressor response in humans. We recommend that heart rate and arterial blood pressure be monitored continuously during percutaneous microcompression of the trigeminal ganglion. Intravenous atropine should be available for immediate use, and an external pacemaker should be fitted preoperatively.\r"

We present two cases which emphasize the serious complications of Herpes zoster ophthalmicus in such patients. Since systemically administered acyclovir may shorten the disease course and reduce the complications of Herpes zoster in immunocompromised individuals, the authors favor treatment of all such patients who have Herpes zoster ophthalmicus with a seven-day course of high-dose (30 mg/kg/day) intravenous acyclovir. To minimize serious neurologic complications in such patients, treatment should be instituted immediately before the results of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing are known.\r"

During 30 months of follow-up the mean CD4+ cell number (x 10(9) per liter) was stable in 134 at entry HIV-1 antibody (HIV-1-Ab) seropositives, who remained HIV-1-Ag negative (from 0.59 to 0.62) and declined in 38 at entry HIV-1-Ab seropositives who were persistently HIV-1-Ag positive (from 0.43 to 0.34). In sera of 9 of 65 HIV-1-Ab seroconverters HIV-1-Ag was detected only once, 3 months before or concomitantly with antibody seroconversion. Another 11 men became persistently HIV-1-Ag positive with antibody seroconversion or 2-6 weeks thereafter. A decline in CD4+ cell numbers was seen between 6 months before and the moment of HIV-1-Ab seroconversion, independently of duration and level of antigen expression. This indicates initial HIV-1 replication in both HIV-1-Ag negatives and positives. Following antibody seroconversion, HIV-1-Ag negatives had higher CD4+ cell numbers than HIV-1-Ag positives. Similarly to those who were HIV antigenemic from entry of the study, the HIV-1-Ab seroconverters who concomitantly with seroconversion or shortly thereafter became HIV-1 antigenemic showed a steady and significant (p = 0.01) decline in CD4+ cell numbers. In those who remained HIV-1-Ag negative after antibody seroconversion, CD4+ cell numbers were stable during follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To date, however, no-one has succeeded in demonstrating a cerebral or spinal cord lesion in vivo following a decompression incident, despite the presence of definitive clinical signs and symptoms of central nervous system involvement. This paper describes the use of 99Tcm-labelled hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO) with single photon emission tomography in a study of three individuals involved in driving accidents. All three suffered cerebral barotrauma during decompression and all exhibited clinical signs and symptoms of dysbarism to a varying degree. Imaging was performed at time intervals ranging from 2 h to several days following the incidents. The results showed well defined cerebral ischaemic lesions in all three subjects. We conclude that 99Tcm-HMPAO imaging provides a significant advance in locating and demonstrating cerebral lesions following barotrauma and will contribute greatly to our understanding of the pathophysiological processes involved.\r"

In an attempt to prevent the suppression of host-antitumour immune mechanisms following surgery we have studied the immunological effects of low-dose perioperative interferon-alpha (r-HuIFN alpha). Patients were randomly allocated pre-operatively to the control (n = 15) or treatment group (n = 15). Patients in the treatment arm received a 1-week course of subcutaneous recombinant human interferon-alpha 2a (Roferon-A) at a dose of 2 megaunits daily starting on the evening before surgery. Natural killer cell, lymphokine activated killer cell cytotoxicities and endogenous interleukin 2 production were measured 1 day before surgery and on the first, third, fifth and tenth postoperative days. Treatment with r-HuIFN alpha did not prevent the postoperative impairment of interleukin 2 production or lymphokine activated killer cell cytotoxicity. However it prevented the fall in natural killer cell activity normally observed following surgery. This may have important consequences in controlling metastatic dissemination of tumour in this vulnerable period.\r"

Raised concentrations of circulating IgG antibodies to alpha gliadin were found in 41/99 sarcoid patients whereas antibody levels to casein, beta lactoglobulin and ovalbumin were similar to normal controls. Subsequently, a group of 26 sarcoid patients were selected for small intestinal biopsy; 11 had raised and 15 normal alpha gliadin antibody (AGA) levels. One AGA positive patient had villous atrophy consistent with coeliac disease. Intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) counts were raised in AGA positive (median 30; 95% confidence limits 22-46) and AGA negative (median 24; 95% confidence limits 19-32) sarcoid patients when compared with a control group (median 13.5; 95% confidence limits 10-18) p less than 0.01. Serum IgG concentrations were raised in 11/52 patients tested but there was no correlation between IgG levels and the presence of IgG antigliadin antibodies. HLA Dr typing was done in 21 of the 26 biopsied patients. The coeliac disease associated antigen Dr3 was present in eight of 21 (38%) which is very similar to the prevalence in unselected blood donors (34%). There was no significant difference in IEL counts between Dr3 positive and Dr3 negative sarcoid patients. These findings suggest that in patients with sarcoidosis, there is an altered gastrointestinal mucosal immune response, accompanied in about 40% of patients by specific sensitisation to wheat protein.\r"

  ".W": "The present study shows that the distribution of T lymphocytes in gastrointestinal carcinomas and their metastases mimic the distribution of T lymphocytes in normal intestine. The composition of the peritumoral reaction resembled that of normal lamina propria with a predominance of CD3 + CD4 + T cells. In contrast, lymphocytes located between carcinomatous cells showed phenotypical features similar to those of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in normal intestine; in particular they expressed the antigen defined by HML-1, a monoclonal antibody raised against normal human intestinal IEL which reveals 95% IEL but very few cells in lymphoid organs and blood. As normal intestinal IEL, the majority of intratumoral lymphocytes had the CD3+ CD8+ phenotype. A panel of monoclonal antibodies and double immunostaining techniques permitted a better characterisation of minor subsets of IEL. Two subsets of HML1 + CD3 + CD4- CD8- and of HML1+ CD3- cells, representing 2% and 3% of normal intestinal IEL respectively, did not significantly increase in carcinomatous epithelium. In contrast, in carcinomatous epithelium, but not in normal intestinal epithelium, we observed the appearance of a few lymphocytes displaying the phenotype of activated T cells (CD25+) or of natural killer cells (NKHI+) or of suppressor cells (CD11+). Such cells may participate in antitumoral defence. Although a similar population of HML1+ lymphocytes is associated with normal and carcinomatous intestinal epithelium, some interactions between lymphocytes and epithelial cells may not be maintained in tumoral epithelium. It has previously been shown that HLA-DR expression by enterocytes is modulated by intraepithelial lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A negative test result does not exclude the diagnosis, as has recently been demonstrated with more sensitive techniques. The association between HLA-DR2 and a positive IFA suggests that the IFA selects a subgroup of patients with Bannwarth's syndrome and a different immune response. We could not demonstrate differences in the clinical spectrum and outcome between the two groups.\r"

We have shown that native envelope glycoproteins (gp120) of HIV-1 inhibit antigen-specific and anti-CD3 induced lymphoproliferation of normal lymphocytes. We have demonstrated that gp120 binds to CD4 positive T lymphocytes and is internalized. These studies suggest that interaction of gp120 with the CD4 receptor may be sufficient to inhibit antigen-specific T cell responses that are mediated via the CD3-Ti receptor complex. Such an event could represent another mechanism by which the overall immune function of the CD4 positive T lymphocyte is depressed and may be relevant in planning investigations on the ongoing vaccine trial involving envelope glycoproteins.\r"

The experiments described here show that expression of virion proteins is dependent upon a small region located in the envelope gene called the cis-acting antirepression sequence (CAR). The CAR region of the envelope sequence is both necessary and sufficient for rev-dependent capsid protein expression. The experiments also show that a defect in either rev or CAR results in a dramatic decrease in the accumulation of the genomic and envelope mRNAs and an overproduction of more extensively spliced viral mRNA species.\r"

At a concentration of 0.2 microM, complete protection was achieved. Even at a 50-fold higher concentration, this lectin is not toxic for the cells. Moreover, the lectin inhibits syncytium formation in the HTLV-IIIB/H9-Jurkat cell system to 100% at 0.2 microM. This effect was abolished by coaddition of D-mannose at a stoichiometric ratio of lectin to sugar of 1:500. The lectin-caused inhibition of syncytia formation was observed also in the HIV-1/human lymphocyte system. Perhaps more importantly, it is shown that the lectin reacts with the oligosaccharide side chains of the HIV-1 gp120 env molecule, which very likely can be classified to the high-mannose oligosaccharides. These data provide the basis for a rational screening for compounds interfering with gp120-CD4 interactions.\r"

Interdigitating cells were identified by antibody to S100 protein, and these varied in number between different tumours. Clustering of interdigitating reticulum cells occurred in association with foci of mature lymphocytes which were shown by staining of the leucocyte common antigen (CD45). The extent to which this occurred was used to assess the degree of medullary differentiation within the thymomas and this was correlated with the histological and clinical features. The lymphocyte population of six of the thymomas was studied using a range of antibodies to T and B cells; this showed the presence of B lymphocytes in thymomas.\r"

A determinate survival rate of 70 per cent disease free at three years was obtained and 74 per cent achieved quality relief of all symptoms. Two patients declined local treatment and survived three years disease free after chemotherapy alone. No recurrence has occurred to date in seven patients achieving apparent complete histological regression (ACHR) in their surgical specimens. Although ACCR does not automatically improve prognosis it is likely that it does enhance the complete remission rate, especially for those also achieving ACHR.

The most common and earliest symptom was difficulty in swallowing in 50 per cent of cases. In 44 per cent of patients the symptoms persisted over six months before diagnosis. Upper and middle thoracic portions of the oesophagus were the sites of origin of the carcinoma in 57 per cent of the patients. The macroscopic picture obtained by oesophagoscopy was regarded as malignant in 83 per cent of patients and extraoesophageal spread of the tumour was estimated to be present in 48 per cent of patients by the time of diagnosis. Histological studies showed the tumour to be squamous cell carcinoma in 62 per cent of patients and in 24 per cent well differentiated. Squamous cell carcinoma was seen more often in men than in women. In patients with carcinoma in situ, alcohol and tobacco were regarded as aetiological factors in 53 per cent of cases.

Clinical and radiographic data from 62 patients were analyzed to determine their relationship to the severity of steal measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The ipsilateral steal index [ISteal(i)] was determined by dividing regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) values within hand-drawn regions of hypoperfusion in the ipsilateral hemisphere by total brain flow, which was calculated as the average rCBF of each hemisphere. Of the patients, 40% were less than 30 years of age, 45% were 30 to 50 years old, and 15% were over 50. Forty-eight per cent presented with hemorrhage and 34% presented with progressive deficits. There was angiographic steal in 37%, and postoperative hyperemic complications developed in 21%. All patients had ipsilateral regions of hypoperfusion. The ISteal(i) was less than 0.7 in 23 (37%), 0.7 to 0.8 in 20 (32%), and greater than 0.8 in 19 (31%). The ISteal(i) was significantly less severe in the patients over 50; 78% of these patients had an ISteal(i) of greater than 0.8 (P less than 0.01). A history of hemorrhage was associated with less severe steal than that in patients who had not bled (P = 0.088). Patients presenting with a history of progressive deficits had increased severity of steal compared with those without progressive deficits (P less than 0.05). A trend toward decreased severity of steal was noted in patients with unfavorable outcomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors suspected a change in the expected sensitivity of coagulase-negative staphylococci when three cases of endophthalmitis due to multiply resistant organisms failed to respond to intravitreal cefazolin and gentamicin. The authors reviewed 48 cases from 1982 to 1986, compared these with 28 cases from 1973 to 1981, they found increased resistance to gentamicin (35 versus 0%, P less than 0.05) and increased resistance to methicillin (27 versus 19%). Eight cases were resistant to both antibiotics, including the three clinical failures. Final vision was unrelated to antimicrobial resistance. Since cephalosporins may be ineffective clinically against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, concomitant gentamicin resistance may render intravitreal cefazolin and gentamicin inadequate for their treatment. No isolates were resistant to vancomycin. Vancomycin and aminoglycoside, used intravitreally in the initial management of endophthalmitis, would be anticipated to provide better coverage than cefazolin and aminoglycoside for endophthalmitis due to the staphylococci, as well as for infections due to streptococcal and bacillus species.\r"

A survey of all ophthalmology residency programs in the United States found that most programs require that residents receive training in low vision aids and devices, but they do not require training in seven other topics concerning the rehabilitation of visually impaired and blind patients. Those programs that do offer training in rehabilitation rely heavily on clinical training. Since practicing ophthalmologists themselves have an incomplete knowledge of the rehabilitation system, it is unlikely that the clinical model will provide residents with sufficient information about rehabilitation. Ophthalmologists need formal training about the rehabilitation process in order to ensure that their patients receive adequate referrals.\r"

There was a predilection for involvement of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and for mid-thoracic dermatomes. The pain descriptors chosen reflected both steady and brief paroxysmal components in most patients. Scarring, sensory loss and the exaggerated sensations of hyperesthesia, dysesthesia and allodynia were common findings. Hyperalgesia and hyperpathia were less common. From these open-label, uncontrolled data, antidepressants (amitriptyline and nortriptyline) appeared useful in about 60% of patients. Topical capsaicin seemed to be a promising new approach. A variety of other pharmacological agents and treatment approaches were less successful. Many patients with PHN even of long standing continued to improve with time.\r"

There were 6 operative deaths (17%). All occurred amongst those (16) undergoing LV plication procedures with no deaths amongst those (19) undergoing aneurysm resection (p less than 0.01). Operative mortality was not influenced by preoperative functional status, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, completeness of revascularisation, endarterectomy (13 patients) or whether cold crystalloid cardioplegia or intermittent aortic cross clamp with ventricular fibrillation was used. Overall 5-year actuarial survival was 70% with survival beyond surgery being 84% to 5 years and independent of the type of aneurysm procedure. Of the survivors, 16 were improved by 1-3 functional classes, 3 were unchanged and one was worse. Surgery in this group of patients offers the prospect of good symptomatic improvement and survival figures which at least equal the results of less complex ventricular aneurysm surgery and exceed those reported for medical management.\r"

At the end of the cold ischaemic cardioplegia, the endothelial cells showed reduced numbers of pinocytotic vesicles, moderate intracellular oedema and slight nuclear changes. During reperfusion the endothelial changes became more pronounced and interstitial oedema developed. These changes persisted, or even increased in the first 60 min of reperfusion, in contrast to the myocytic changes, which tended to regress. The endothelial cells of the myocardial microvasculature thus appeared to be more vulnerable than the myocytes to cold ischaemic cardioplegia and reperfusion. Focally reduced blood reperfusion due to endothelial swelling and interstitial oedema did not seem to be the main cause of the focal postischaemic myocytic damage.\r"

Interstitial fluid was collected via subcutaneously implanted double nylon wicks and Pif was measured with the 'wick-in-needle' technique. Measurements were made preoperatively and 1 1/2 to 8 hours (mean 4 hours) after termination of extracorporeal circulation. Pif rose to 2.3 mmHg above the pre-bypass level. COPpl concomitantly fell from 22.2 to 14.4 and COPif from 12.4 to 10.1 mmHg. These changes were statistically significant. Although the relatively large COPpl drop resulted in a net rise of 3.2 mmHg in filtration pressure, the incidence of pulmonary complications was low and no subcutaneous edema was discernible. The fall in COPif and rise in Pif may be regarded as important edema-preventing mechanisms.\r"

Hookworm, Giardia, Strongyloides, and Hymenolepis nana were most commonly found. In comparison to studies done at the time of immigration, all parasites had decreased in frequency, but Giardia, hookworm, and H nana remain common. Although initial screening efforts may have failed to identify substantial numbers of infected refugees, poor compliance with treatment may also explain the persistence of intestinal parasites in our patients. The continued presence of Giardia and H nana, especially among children, may be explained by person-to-person transmission or autoinfection.\r"

The incidence of intraluminal thrombotic occlusion of surgically excised, failed aortocoronary vein grafts was 42 (66%) in 64 patients with nonfibrotic, patent grafts. Most of these vessels were severely atherosclerotic. The presence of intraluminal thrombi in about half of patients who died of acute myocardial infarction and in two thirds of excised, nonfibrotic, previously patent vein grafts indicates how many patients may benefit from thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Eight with pneumonia who died had a mean value of 926 IU: all had values higher than 520 IU. The mean LDH values for 20 patients with AIDS (35 admissions) who survived and 4 who died of non-Pneumocystis disease were 240 IU and 350 IU, respectively; these patients were the control population. The positive and negative predictive values for survival using 520 IU as the threshold are 61% and 100%. Thus, LDH measurements in the first days of admission for P carinii pneumonia predict mortality and are useful in guiding future management.\r"

Pathological changes in this disorder are generally restricted to subcortical structures, yet the type and range of cognitive deficits suggest the involvement of many cerebral regions. We examined the extent of functional impairment to cerebral cortical and subcortical structures as measured by the level of glucose metabolic activity at rest. Fourteen patients with PSP were compared to 21 normal volunteers of similar age using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography. Glucose metabolism was reduced in the caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, pons, and cerebral cortex, but not in the cerebellum in the patients with PSP as compared to the normal subjects. Analysis of individual brain regions revealed significant declines in cerebral glucose utilization in most regions throughout the cerebral cortex, particularly those in the superior half of the frontal lobe. Declines in the most affected regions of cerebral cortex were greater than those in any single subcortical structure. Although using conventional neuropathological techniques the cerebral cortex appears to be unaffected in PSP, significant and pervasive functional impairments in both cortical and subcortical structures are present. These observations help to account for the constellation of cognitive symptoms in individual patients with PSP and the difficulty encountered in identifying a characteristic psychometric profile for this group of patients.\r"

We devised a scale to quantitate the degree of ataxia in the neurological examinations. lCMRGlc was measured with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography (PET). Tissue atrophy was assessed by visual rating of computed tomographic scans. PET studies revealed marked hypometabolism in the cerebellar vermis, cerebellar hemispheres, and brainstem of OPCA patients compared with 30 control subjects. A significant correlation was found between severity of motor impairment and lCMRGlc within the cerebellar vermis, both cerebellar hemispheres, and the brainstem. A significant but weaker relationship was noted between the degree of tissue atrophy in these regions and clinical severity. Partial correlation analysis revealed that motor dysfunction in OPCA correlated more strongly with lCMRGlc than with the amount of tissue atrophy. These results suggest that the clinical manifestations of OPCA are more closely related to the metabolic state of the tissue than to the structural changes in the cerebellum.\r"

The drug was effective in lowering rectal temperature on most (80 per cent) occasions; failure to elicit a response was not restricted to particular patients or patterns of injury. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis to the antipyretic effects of acetaminophen.

The rats were burned over 30 per cent of their body surface area and then inoculated intraperitoneally with 40 units of tetanus toxoid. Complement fixation and acid phosphatase tests were carried out on the days 15 and 21 postburn. On day 21, the rats were killed and the spleens removed and weighted. In the groups that received vitamin E, the spleen weight and complement fixation test increased significantly while the acid phosphatase in serum decreased. In the clinical study, 17 burned patients with over 20 per cent deep partial or full skin thickness burns and eight healthy persons were studied. Nine of the 17 burned patients received vitamin E on 3 consecutive days, on day 4 blood was taken for analysis. The results showed that the number of T-cells decreased significantly in burn patients (P less than 0.05) whereas they increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in burn patients who received vitamin E. It is concluded from these experimental and clinical studies that vitamin E stimulates both cellular and humoral immunity. Therefore, the use of vitamin E in combination with conventional therapy in burn patients can be recommended.\r"

Except for slight bleeding from a temporary ileostomy, the bleeding and need for transfusion terminated promptly. This experience confirms that estrogen-progesterone therapy may promote cessation of bleeding gastrointestinal telangiectasias and indicates the need for controlled investigations.\r"

We briefly review the spectrum and pathogenesis of atheromicroembolic injury to the gastrointestinal tract. Atheromicroemboli, which occlude vessels too small to be visualized by angiography, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who have undergone aortic instrumentation.\r"

The monthly prevalence declined from a range of 30-40% during the initial 6 months to about 10% for patients treated for 18-24 months. Most diarrhea was intermittent and mild; only 11 patients (8%) discontinued treatment because of diarrheal symptoms. No intervention was required in 46 of the 101 patients affected. In 44 others, loose stools were successfully managed with antidiarrheal medications, a reduction in dosage, or both. Although diarrhea is a common event during AF administration, particularly early in therapy, for most patients it usually does not significantly interfere with treatment.\r"

Sixteen (7%) ocular injuries were associated with BB gun pellets and six of these children (42%) were blinded in the injured eye as a result. Two other cases of blindness resulted from ocular penetration by homemade \"Jinsang Stars,\" underscoring the adverse influence of media on children's games. Adult supervision could have potentially prevented most cases of permanent visual deficit. The authors suggest that legislation restricting the use of BB guns be passed and that a program of adult and child eye safety education including \"eye watch\" warnings on potentially hazardous toys be developed.\r"

The authors studied 54 members of a family with dominantly inherited retinitis pigmentosa in five generations. In addition to the typical clinical findings of retinitis pigmentosa, eight persons also had a bull's eye maculopathy, and four persons had uni- or bilateral optic nerve drusen. When the authors determined the plasma fatty acid and lipid contents, they saw the expected age-related effect on cholesterol and triglycerides, but an unexpected, significant reduction in fatty acids in the unaffected controls as compared with persons with retinitis pigmentosa. The authors' results emphasize the heterogeneity of phenotypic expression of retinitis pigmentosa within a single family.\r"

Because of the controversial nature of many of these reports, the authors undertook a detailed investigation of cellular and humoral immunity in a well-characterized group of 47 persons with retinitis pigmentosa of various heritability patterns and a similar number of age- and sex-matched controls. The authors found two changes in lymphocyte subsets. Retinitis pigmentosa patients had significantly elevated Leu 3A-positive lymphocytes (CD4 or T-helper cells) and significantly fewer Leu 2A-positive lymphocytes (CD8 or T-suppressor cells) than controls, although the total numbers of T cells did not differ between the two groups. A small but significant number of retinitis pigmentosa patients expressed interleukin 2 (IL-2) antigens on their lymphocytes as compared with none of the controls. The authors saw no differences between the retinitis pigmentosa and control groups in the inducibility and secretion of gamma-interferon or IL-2. Concentrations of immunoglobulins G, A, and M did not differ between the two groups. The link between immune system alterations and the retinitis pigmentosa process remains tenuous.\r"

A survey was undertaken of all botulinum toxin investigators to determine the incidence of imaged mass lesions causing HFS. Responders contributed information on 1676 patients with HFS. Of this group, nine tumors were reported for an incidence of 0.54% of patients. However, of this group only 52.5% underwent computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) scanning so the incidence of tumor causing HFS could be as high as 1.0%. No one tumor type was predominant, and most patients were women older than 50 years of age. The incidence compares with another large series of HFS patients in which one tumor was found in 367 patients. The authors also report as an illustrative case a 26-year-old man with HFS due to a presumed lipoma of the cerebellopontine angle. This diagnosis can be made with increased certainty with MR scanning. If the incidence of unsuspected diagnostically significant mass lesions is 1 in 200 patients with HFS referred for botulinum toxin injection, the cost of detecting one such lesion would be $100,000 at an average imaging cost of $500 per MR imaging or CT examination. Although mass lesions are uncommon, any patient with HFS whose general clinical course could justify intervention should be considered for imaging studies to rule out treatable conditions other than vascular compression.\r"

Only 7 of 26 (27%) 2-month-olds had an increase in H. influenzae b capsular polysaccharide antibody after a single dose of HbOC, a proportion similar to that of saline controls (9 of 25, 36%). After a second HbOC dose at 4 months 88% had antibody concentrations of 0.15 microgram or more, and after a third dose at 6 months all had antibody levels greater than or equal to 0.15 microgram/ml. The group receiving both HbOC and bacterial polysaccharide immunoglobulin at 2 months uniformly had H. influenzae b CP antibody concentrations of greater than or equal to 0.15 microgram/ml at 4 months (P less than 0.001 relative to \"HbOC alone\" group) and subsequently responded similarly to second and third doses of HbOC vaccine as did also the \"HbOC alone\" group. We conclude that combined passive/active immunization with bacterial polysaccharide immunoglobulin and HbOC at 2 months maintains antibody at concentrations thought to be protective (greater than or equal to 0.15 microgram/ml) without interfering with the active antibody response to second and third doses of HbOC at 4 and 6 months of age.\r"

Serum, urine and either sputum or nasopharyngeal secretions were collected during the first 5 days of therapy for antigen detection. Blood culture was positive in 6 of 52 (11.5%) of cases. Antigens were detected by counterimmunoelectrophoresis and/or LA in 13 of 60 (21.7%) serum samples, 2 of 16 (12.5%) unconcentrated urine samples, 19 of 42 (45.2%) urine samples concentrated 25-fold and 21 of 45 (46.7%) sputum or nasopharyngeal secretions. Antibiotic treatment for 5 days did not affect the antigen detection rate. Counter-immunoelectrophoresis was more sensitive than LA in serum and urine but not in sputum. However, because false positive reactions were frequently obtained with LA on nasopharyngeal secretions of an age-matched control group, this test appears unreliable.\r"

This low molecular weight IgM moiety contributed up to 33% of the total circulating IgM and was strongly associated with raised serum concentrations of IgM and the presence of antinuclear antibodies, extractable antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor. Immunoblot analysis of positive serum samples showed small quantities of other low molecular weight oligomers of IgM in addition to monomeric IgM. It is postulated that the presence of low molecular weight IgM in the serum of patients with juvenile chronic arthritis reflects a disorder of the intracellular assembly of IgM subunits during a stimulated IgM immune response. The pathogenetic role of low molecular weight IgM remains uncertain.\r"

The PC scale had a high degree of internal reliability and a greater correlation with patient satisfaction than two commonly used provider continuity measures, even after controlling for demographic variables. The cost of ambulatory primary medical care was not significantly related to any of the continuity measures. The measurement of patient attitudes to define continuity provided information distinct from provider continuity formulas.\r"

The study population was defined as those people who were registered with one of 50 collaborating general practitioners (GPs). Referrals to the study were primarily from the GPs though, to ensure complete case ascertainment, hospital casualty and admission registers, death certificates and special data from the Oxford Record Linkage Study were also scrutinized. Six hundred and seventy five cases of clinically definite first-ever in a lifetime stroke were registered in four years yielding a crude annual incidence of 1.60/1,000 or 2.00/1,000 when adjusted to the 1981 population of England and Wales. The age and sex specific incidence rates for first stroke showed a steep rise with age for both sexes. The odds of a male sustaining a first stroke were 26% greater than those of a female. Ninety one per cent of patients were examined in a median time of four days after the event by a study neurologist and 88% had cerebral CT or necropsy.\r"

In parallel with this, there was a 2-fold increase in the serum free concentrations of diflunisal in the arthritic rats. Thus, the increase in diflunisal analgesic response in arthritis may be attributed to pharmacokinetic perturbations, resulting from alterations in serum protein binding and not to changes in drug pharmacodynamics. Endogenous binding inhibitors in adjuvant arthritis may contribute to the observed decreased in diflunisal protein binding.\r"

Two hundred and twenty-nine consecutive patients referred with chronic upper limb pain which had been labelled \"repetitive strain injury\" or \"overuse syndrome\" were assessed according to a protocol designed to give insight into the questions: Is the pain genuine or falsely reported, i.e., malingering? If genuine is it due to a physical injury, a pain syndrome, or a mixture of both? Twenty-nine patients fulfilled criteria for specific rheumatological diagnoses (fibrositis 15, rotator cuff syndrome 3, rheumatoid arthritis 3, cervical referred pain 3, lateral epicondylitis 2, de Quervain's tenosynovitis 1, carpal tunnel syndrome 1, and psoriatic monoarthritis 1). In the remaining 200 (mean age 37 years, range 19-58, 91.5% female) many different pain patterns and nonspecific associated symptoms were recorded. Eighty-nine percent had greater than or equal to 2 Smythe tender points, 1.5% had 1 tender point, and 9.5% had no tender point. Diffuse pain and greater than 7 tender points is sufficient to diagnose fibrositis, and localized pain and a smaller number of tender points strongly suggests a genuine chronic rheumatic pain syndrome. Stress, personal susceptibility and poor motivation appeared important in some cases. The liberal workers' compensation system, early labeling as repetitive strain injury, and social acceptability appeared important in the development of the epidemic.\r"

The alcoholics had somewhat longer drug histories and more vivid memories of their first drinking experiences; polydrug abuse, however, was no more common in this group. Finally, the first-degree relatives of the alcoholics had significantly more alcoholism than the first-degree relatives of the nonalcoholic patients. Implications regarding the relationship of alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse are discussed.\r"

The effect of exogenous recombinant interleukin-2 was studied on the proliferative and cytotoxic responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 39 patients with sarcoidosis and 14 healthy control subjects. The proliferative response to purified protein derivative was smaller in patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.001) whereas the response to 80 U interleukin-2 alone and to purified protein derivative and interleukin-2 did not differ significantly between the two groups. In addition, in eight patients but no control subjects tritiated thymidine incorporation induced by the combination of purified protein derivative and interleukin-2 was more than twice the sum of that induced by purified protein derivative and interleukin separately. Cytotoxic activity occurring spontaneously and induced by purified protein derivative and interleukin-2 in blood mononuclear cells was significantly less for patients with sarcoidosis than for control subjects (p less than 0.05 spontaneous, less than 0.001 purified protein derivative induced, less than 0.02 interleukin induced). Synergism between antigen and interleukin did not occur with respect to the cytotoxic response in either patients or controls. Defective interleukin-2 production may contribute to, but does not entirely explain, the functional abnormalities of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with sarcoidosis.\r"

To more adequately address broader epidemiologic questions concerning this skin infection, we surveyed members of four southeastern college wrestling teams, sampled high school and college athletic trainers nationwide, and obtained serum specimens from members of one college wrestling team for HSV antibody studies. Nine of 48 (18.8%) college wrestlers in the southeastern athletic conference reported histories of herpes gladiatorum. Wrestlers with a prior history of oral HSV infection (cold sores) were less likely to report HSV skin infection than wrestlers without cold sores (RR = 0.25; 95% C.I. 0.03 to 1.8), while wrestlers with exposure to opponents with cutaneous HSV lesions were at high risk to develop herpes gladiatorum (RR = 9.4; 95% C.I. 2.2 to 40.0). The national survey of athletic trainers indicated that 7.6% of college wrestlers and 2.6% of high school wrestlers had HSV skin infection during the 1984-85 season. Herpes gladiatorum is a common problem among college wrestlers, and morbidity associated with this skin disease can be significant.\r"

Phenotypic analysis of CSF cells demonstrated that the majority were T cells (CD3+) of the helper/inducer subset (CD4+). These T cells were directly expanded from the CSF by limiting dilution. A total of 505 T-cell lines were tested for Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb)-specific proliferation and also partly tested for reactivity to a panel of central and peripheral nervous system antigens. Proliferative assays revealed 33 of them to be Bb specific, 16 to be specific for myelin basic protein, 16 to be specific for peripheral myelin, 1 to be specific for cardiolipin, and 2 to be specific for galactocerebrosides. The antigen-specific proliferation was restricted by autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules. The majority of CSF-derived T-cell lines stained positively for CD3, CD4, and HLA class II antigens and negatively for CD8 (cytotoxic/suppressor subset). One T-cell line provided help for the production of specific IgG by autologous B cells and secreted gamma-interferon upon stimulation with Bb antigen in the presence of autologous antigen-presenting cells. These data show that in patients with severe neurological manifestations of late Lyme disease, not only Bb-specific T-cell lines but also T cells reactive to central or peripheral nervous system autoantigens can be found.\r"

We now report the following. (1) The predominant T-cell phenotype within MS lesions is CD2,3,8. This phenotype marks the suppressor-cytotoxic subset. (2) These cells do not express the natural killer cell marker NKH-1, which is present on a subset of CD8-positive cells in peripheral blood. (3) The infiltrating cell expresses class I (HLA A, B, C), but not class II (DR and DQ), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. (4) Other T-cell surface molecules, including the activation antigens interleukin-2 receptor, Ta1, and T11-3, as well as the marker 2H4, are largely not expressed. (5) Endothelial cells express both class I and class II MHC molecules and the 4B4 molecule in both MS and control tissue. (6) Astrocytes within the vicinity of MS lesions are predominantly class II MHC-negative. These results demonstrate that the T-cell infiltrate present in MS tissue on autopsy has a restricted phenotypic profile, but they also raise the possibility that, within this population, few activated effector cells are present.\r"

Following a previous shunt replacement, he developed florid parkinsonism which was associated with Parinaud syndrome. The initial single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain using 99mTc-hexamethylpropylenamine oxime demonstrated decreased cerebral blood flow in the regions of the left caudate and putamen. The patient underwent shunt revision with minimal improvement and therefore levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet 100/25) was administered. Subsequently, he experienced almost complete recovery which may have been correlated with probable improvement of the basal ganglia regional cerebral blood flow. Parkinsonism associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt obstruction is a rare but reversible disorder that is responsive to shunt replacement and antiparkinsonian drug administration. Cerebral perfusion studies may prove to be of value in delineating the pathophysiology of this complication.\r"

Twenty-four IgA nephritic patients, 12 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (non-IgA nephropathy), and 17 healthy controls were studied in an infection-free interval. T-cell subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and activated T-lymphocyte subsets expressing IL-2R were determined by double immunofluorescence staining with fluorochromes conjugated to monoclonal antibodies against T-helper/inducer (CD4+) cell, T-suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8+) cell, B (CD20+) lymphocytes, and IL-2R. The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, CD4/CD8 ratio, and total activated lymphocytes (with IL-2R/CD25 antigen) did not differ between the IgA nephritic patients, patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, and healthy controls in freshly isolated, unstimulated lymphocytes or PBMC cultured with pokeweed mitogen. Following pokeweed mitogen stimulation for 5 days, 17.3 +/- 10.3%, 16.6 +/- 8.4%, and 16.7 +/- 9.4% of PBMC from IgA nephritic patients, patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, and controls respectively expressed IL-2R (p greater than 0.05). However, the individual T-cell subsets bearing IL-2R were distinctly different between the IgA nephritic patients and patients with chronic glomerulonephritis or healthy controls. IgA nephritic patients had increased activated CD4+ lymphocytes (with IL-2R) (p less than 0.025) and reduced activated CD8+ lymphocytes (p less than 0.025). Our study suggests a defective immunoregulation in IgA nephropathy with enhanced T-helper/inducer and reduced T-suppressor/cytotoxic activity when stimulated with mitogen and probably, during clinical exacerbation.\r"

MICs and MBCs of oxacillin and penicillin with and without clavulanic acid or sulbactam (4 or 16 micrograms/ml, respectively) were determined for 11 Staphylococcus aureus and 2 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates for which oxacillin MICs were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility studies were done with incubation at 35 and 30 degrees C, and the MICs were read at 24 and 48 h. Of the 13 isolates, 4 became resistant when longer incubation or 30 degrees C incubation was used, and the MICs for 9 remained in the intermediate range. Only three of these strains were susceptible to penicillin, and beta-lactamase was not detected. For 6 of 10 beta-lactamase-positive strains, there was a greater-than-twofold-dilution reduction in oxacillin MICs with the addition of clavulanic acid or sulbactam. Of the four strains that became resistant with incubation at the lower temperature, a clavulanic acid effect was observed in three but only at 35 degrees C. The oxacillin MIC for one of the beta-lactamase-negative strains was also reduced with clavulanic acid; however, this strain was inhibited by 1 microgram of clavulanic acid per ml alone. Bactericidal activity was observed with two or four times the oxacillin MIC in eight strains tested at both temperatures, and the combination with clavulanic acid was bactericidal at higher than four times the MIC in five of the strains at 30 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

More than one-third of the samples contained resistant organisms comprising 50% or more of the total flora examined. Organisms with coresistance to multiple drugs were found frequently. Individuals taking antibiotics produced more samples with a higher proportion (greater than 50%) of resistant bacteria, and these samples also had a significantly greater number of different resistance determinants.

Cefoperazone showed the highest antibacterial activity, followed by ceftezole, cefazolin, cefamandole, and cephalothin. There were two groups of resistant strains: one group (ca. 15%), of which B. fragilis G-232 was a typical sample, was resistant to ceftezole (MIC, 100 micrograms/ml), cefazolin (MIC, 100 micrograms/ml), and cephalothin (MIC, 200 micrograms/ml) but not cefoperazone (MIC, 6.25 micrograms/ml) or cefamandole (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml). On the basis of studies of stability to beta-lactamase, outer membrane permeation, and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), we conclude that decreased affinity for PBP 3 may play an important role in the resistance to ceftezole, cefazolin, and cephalothin in B. fragilis G-232. Another group (also ca. 15%), of which B. fragilis G-242 was a representative, was resistant to all five cephalosporins (MIC, 100 to 400 micrograms/ml) and produced a high amount of beta-lactamase. Similar broad-spectrum resistance was seen in a mutant of strain G-232 that had a greater-than-30-fold increase in beta-lactamase production.\r"

We reviewed the records of 44 patients treated with ganciclovir for culture-confirmed cytomegalovirus retinal (31 patients) or gastrointestinal disease (17 patients) or both (four patients) in 1986. Retinitis stabilized or improved during initial treatment with ganciclovir in 22 of 27 (81.5 per cent) patients. Following a median 10-day induction course, 16 patients with retinitis continued to have serial ophthalmologic assessments: eight patients were maintained on treatment and eight had maintenance treatment deferred. Before treatment, the two groups were comparable in age, Karnofsky scores, hematologic assessment, visual acuity, and history with respect to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Retinitis did not progress for a median 53.8 days in the immediate maintenance group compared to 18.8 days for the deferred maintenance group (p = 0.01). In 17 patients with CMV gastrointestinal disease, nine of 14 (64 per cent) had resolution of pain and eight of 11 (73 per cent) had resolution of diarrhea when treated initially with ganciclovir. In both retinitis and gastrointestinal disease patients, ganciclovir decreased recovery of CMV from urine and blood markedly. Ganciclovir also caused a decrease in mean absolute neutrophil counts to about half of baseline values; decreases in mean platelet count and hemoglobin were also noted but were less than 25 per cent. Neutropenia severe enough to require dose adjustment (less than 800 cells/microliters) occurred in 31 per cent of patients receiving maintenance ganciclovir.\r"

We suggest that they may be imperfect homeostatic mechanisms attempting to maintain systemic arterial pressure in response to chronic vasodilatation and that small, endogenous opioid peptides may play a part in this vasodilatation. As initial investigation of this hypothesis, we measured noradrenaline (an indicator of sympathetic tone), adrenaline and methionine enkephalin in the plasma of patients with cirrhosis with oesophageal varices which had or had not bled previously, patients with cirrhosis without varices, patients with acute liver disease and controls. In patients with cirrhosis, noradrenaline, adrenaline and methionine enkephalin were all greatest in those with oesophageal varices which had previously bled. In this group, noradrenaline correlated strongly with the widely used prognostic guide, Pugh's modification of Child's classification. In patients with acute liver disease, methionine enkephalin and adrenaline were increased six- and four-fold respectively. However, noradrenaline was normal, suggesting that increased sympathetic tone in cirrhosis may develop gradually. The use of opioid antagonists may enable determination of whether elevated plasma opioid peptides in cirrhosis stimulate the increase in sympathetic tone and plasma adrenaline, and promote bleeding oesophageal varices.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-sectional associations of social stressors, social supports, and coping strategies with health status were explored in a self-selected sample of 157 white adults. Using a mailed questionnaire, stressful life changes were assessed by a 40-item version of the Social Readjustment Rating Scale, social supports were measured by a 13-item index, and health status was assessed by the 63-item Duke-UNC Health Profile (DUHP). Responses to a recent stressful event were categorized by method of coping and by focus of coping. In a multivariate analysis controlling for the effects of age, gender, and education level, higher 12 month life change score was related to lower composite DUHP score. The use of active-cognitive coping was directly associated and the use of avoidance-coping was inversely associated with health status. When interaction terms were included in the multivariate analysis, avoidance-coping potentiated the adverse health effect of stressors and weak social supports potentiated the harmful effect of avoidance-coping on health. The findings suggest that the propensity to engage in avoidant behavior in response to a stressful experience is associated with health impairment, particularly when social supports are weak.\r"

MBC and kill kinetics tests were both performed using Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), with and without 2% NaCl supplementation, and incubation at 30 and 35 degrees C. When MBC testing was performed with salt-supplemented MHB, the oxacillin MBC/MIC ratio was greater than 8 for 17 and 16 of 17 S. aureus isolates at 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively. With unsupplemented MHB, the MBC/MIC ratio was greater than 8 for nine and six strains at 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively. Five representative strains were selected for kill kinetics studies under the four different test conditions. Oxacillin appeared more bactericidal by the kill kinetics method than by MBC testing. Moreover, salt supplementation did not affect the results of kill kinetics studies as dramatically as it did the MBC results. Thus, bactericidal testing results are markedly influenced by the technique employed, and further in vivo studies are necessary to fully evaluate the efficiency of oxacillin against beta-lactamase-hyperproducing strains of S. aureus.\r"

  ".W": "Since beta-lactam resistance is a feature of Pseudomonas cepacia isolates causing pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis (CF), this study was undertaken to determine whether alterations in beta-lactam permeability mediate drug resistance in this species. A beta-lactam-susceptible non-CF isolate (strain 75-26), a resistant mutant derived from 75-26 by selection for cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime, and two resistant CF isolates of P. cepacia were used. Permeability constants were calculated from the rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis in intact bacterial cells. Qualitative changes in outer membrane proteins were determined electrophoretically. The permeability constants of the mutant and the resistant CF isolates were lower than the value for the reference strain, 75-26. Whereas the lipopolysaccharide side chains were present in the test and reference strains, the resistant mutant and the CF isolates contained reduced amounts of the 36-kilodalton (kDa) outer membrane protein and failed to express the 27-kDa outer membrane protein. These observations suggest that the 27-kDa outer membrane protein may be a major porin or a major protein component of the porin complex in P. cepacia and that decreased expression of the 36-kDa outer membrane and loss of the 27-kDa porin are associated with high-level beta-lactam resistance in some CF isolates of P. cepacia.\r"

The antiherpesvirus mechanism of B-220 was sought. The compound inhibited replication of herpes simplex virus type 1, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus in tissue culture at concentrations of 1 to 5 microM, depending on the cell type used for assay and the amount of virus. Cellular toxicity was seen at a concentration of 10 to 30 microM, and antiviral activity in the human bladder cancer and human embryonic lung fibroblast cell lines tested was found at concentrations 3 to 15 times lower than the concentrations causing cellular toxicity. Viral DNA synthesis, as well as production of early and late viral proteins, was inhibited at 0.5 to 4.5 microM B-220, but viral DNA polymerases tested in vitro were not inhibited at these concentrations. There was no interaction with the pyrophosphate analog foscarnet, and no reversal of the antiviral activity of B-220 occurred with naturally occurring nucleosides. We conclude that the antiviral effect depends on the multiplicity of infection and may occur at the level of viral DNA synthesis and that no interference occurs with pyrophosphate analogs or nucleosides. The more potent activity against viral DNA than against cellular DNA may be caused by a true selectivity for herpesvirus DNA or by the higher metabolism of viral DNA in infected cells.\r"

Each subject exercised five times weekly for 10 weeks during the first regimen and 32 weeks during the second regimen. 2. Whole-body protein turnover determined by L-[1-13C]leucine during feeding remained constant during both exercise regimens, when expressed either in terms of body weight or fat-free mass derived from measurements of total body potassium. 3. Quadriceps muscle protein synthetic rate increased during the study, from 0.0712 to 0.0985%/h (P less than 0.05), as did quadriceps muscle area assessed by computed tomography. 4. Bone mineral content for lumbar vertebrae was normal in all four patients, but for the femoral mid-shaft bone mineral content averaged only 66% of normal for three of the patients. Trabecular bone density in the distal tibia ranged from normal to 2% of normal for the men with the shortest and longest periods of disability, respectively. No changes in bone mineral content or bone density occurred during the exercise period.\r"

Whether these conditions are malignant lymphoproliferative disorders remains controversial. Here we report the results of studies carried out in a patient with coeliac disease, who developed recurrent self-healing subcutaneous nodules with the histological changes of lymphomatoid granulomatosis and an invasive nasal tumour with the histological features of lethal midline granuloma. The patient subsequently also developed an erythrophagocytic syndrome. Immunocytochemical labelling of both cutaneous and nasal lesions demonstrated a predominant population of T cells with a CD4-negative CD8-positive phenotype. Analysis of DNA from cutaneous tissue revealed a discrete rearrangement of the beta and gamma T-cell receptor genes. These findings suggest that lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a clonal T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder and its association with lethal midline granuloma indicates that both conditions may have a common histogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "89042144\r", 
  ".W": "The antigen receptor of the T lymphocyte consists of two variable T-cell receptor chains (either TCR-alpha, TCR-beta or TCR-gamma, TCR-delta) noncovalently linked to four different invariant membrane proteins (CD3-gamma, CD3-delta, CD3-epsilon, and the CD3-zeta homodimer). The CD3 genes are expressed early in thymocyte development, preceding the rearrangement and expression of the T-cell receptor genes. Here we report the isolation and structural analysis of the human CD3-epsilon gene. The gene consisted of nine exons. Three exons, encoding the junction of leader peptide and mature protein, were extremely small (21, 15, and 18 base pairs, respectively). The murine gene contained only two such miniexons, the sequences of which were not homologous to those of the three human miniexons. But from comparisons of intron sequences the regions surrounding the human miniexons III and IV appeared to be closely related to those surrounding the murine miniexons III and IV. The most-3' miniexon in the human gene (IVa) had no murine counterpart and appeared not to duplicate any of the other miniexons. Sequence analysis of CD3-epsilon cDNA clones isolated from four independent libraries gave no evidence for alternative use of these miniexons. Like CD3-delta, the CD3-epsilon gene was transcribed from a weak, nontissue-specific, TATA-less promoter. Pulsed-field electrophoresis showed that the human CD3-epsilon gene was separated from the CD3-gamma, CD3-delta gene pair by at least 30 kilobases, but by no more than 300 kilobases.\r"

Of the 410 rheumatoid arthritis patients who were originally administered the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS), 299 completed a follow-up five years later. Data were analyzed using nine health status scales, three components of health status, and an overall arthritis impact item. Results for survivors indicated that there were no clinically important deteriorations in any of these measures. In fact, small improvements on most measures were found. The health status changes were similar for patients originally in a clinical trial and for those receiving routine specialty care. Age was found to positively relate to improvements in psychological status and overall arthritis impact, but we were unable to demonstrate any consistent effects of sex, marital status, education, or disease duration. Our results contrast with other studies that have noted major declines over time in the health status of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, level of education was not a major determinant of morbidity in this group. These results suggest that health status in certain patients with rheumatoid arthritis is more stable than previously thought. This has implications for both clinical practice and clinical research in rheumatology.\r"

  ".U": "89056353\r", 
  ".W": "In type A aortic dissection, the intimal disruption is located on or extends to the transverse arch in about 20% of patients. Replacement of the arch may then be necessary to avoid leaving an unresected, acutely dissected aorta and to prevent bleeding, progression of aneurysm, rupture, and ultimately reoperation or death. From 1970 to September 1987, 119 patients were operated on for type A acute dissection. Starting in January 1977, gelatin-resorcin-formaldehyde biologic glue was used in 91 patients to reinforce the dissected tissues at the suture sites. Among these 119 patients, 26 (ages 32 to 76 years) underwent replacement of the transverse aortic arch in addition to replacement of the ascending aorta. In 20 patients cerebral protection was achieved by profound hypothermia (16 degrees to 20 degrees C) associated with circulatory arrest (15 to 40 minutes, mean 27 minutes) during the distal anastomosis. In six patients the carotid arteries were selectively perfused with cold blood (6 degrees C) during moderate core hypothermia (28 degrees C) while cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued (19 to 34 minutes, mean 25 minutes) to allow the prosthesis to be sutured without the distal aorta being cross-clamped. Moderate hypothermia avoided the long rewarming time necessitated by profound hypothermia. The hospital mortality rate was 34% (9/26). Two of the 20 patients subjected to profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest died during the operation and seven patients died of postoperative complications. No deaths or major complication were observed in the other six patients. Follow-up of the 17 survivors ranges from 3 to 90 months (mean 39). One patient died 6 months after the operation of cerebral hemorrhage. One patient is disabled by neurologic sequelae. Fifteen patients are in good clinical condition (New York Heart Association class I or II). Postoperative aortograms in 12 patients, and computed tomographic scans in all, have shown a stable repair of the transverse arch in all survivors but a persisting dissection of the descending aorta in 11 (70%). Growing experience and improving results in emergency operations for type A aortic dissection have led us to extend the replacement of the aorta to the transverse arch whenever necessary. The gelatin-resorcin-formaldehyde glue has proved to be an efficient adjunct. The best cerebral protection was obtained in our experience by carotid perfusion with cold blood during circulatory arrest at moderate core hypothermia.\r"

Asthma was diagnosed on the basis of self reporting of asthma diagnosed by a physician and by record linkage to a national register of hospital admissions to all general and tuberculosis hospitals during 1972 and 1983. The prevalence of diagnosed asthma in 1975 was significantly higher among male smokers than among male non-smokers (relative risk (RR) = 1.73); no significant difference was observed for women (RR = 1.33). People with asthma were slightly but not significantly more likely to stop smoking during the six year follow up period (RR = 1.23). The incidence of asthma among those who had neither reported asthma in 1975 nor been admitted to hospital for asthma before the 1975 questionnaire study was not significantly higher among smokers than among non-smokers during follow up. Although possible mechanisms exist to explain how smoking could have a role in the aetiology of asthma, this study suggests that smoking is not a strong risk factor for asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Iodinated glycerol is used as a mucolytic expectorant in the treatment of respiratory disorders. Iodine can inhibit the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone and induce hypothyroidism, particularly in patients with a history of thyroid disease. Such effects have not been reported in individuals without known thyroid disease who are being treated with organically bound iodine in the form of iodinated glycerol. In the course of a thyroid screening program for nursing home residents, eight subjects were identified who were being treated with iodinated glycerol. Five of these were found to have thyrotropin elevations; one showed a low serum thyroxine level and a decreased free thyroxine index. None of these residents had a history of thyroid disease. Abnormalities of thyroid function improved or resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Elderly nursing home residents without known thyroid disease are at risk of thyroid suppression when given iodinated glycerol.\r"

In a phase I clinical trial, 19 patients were treated with the two drugs at one of three dose levels. The dose-limiting toxic effect was myelosuppression.

This interview independently evaluates the lifetime prevalence of 15 major psychiatric disorders. In addition to alcoholism, the most frequently occurring coexisting disorders were depression, antisocial personality and drug abuse. After 1 year, the number of positive syndromes declined slightly (chi = 2.0 to 1.8). However, the absolute and relative number of additional psychiatric syndromes remained stable over 1 year for the entire sample. Across individuals, the overall rates of agreement for the 15 syndromes ranged from a high of 100% to a low of 85%. Similarly, the agreement for the current and lifetime diagnoses ranged from 86 to 99%. These data indicate that a substantial portion of male alcoholics experience symptoms that are common to other psychiatric disorders. They also suggest that the endorsement of multiple psychiatric symptoms is not due simply to the acute emotional and physical distress that often accompanies a recent hospitalization for alcoholism treatment. Instead, for many male alcoholics, the symptom patterns appear to reflect additional psychiatric disorders that are stable over time and a potential target of treatment.\r"

Measurements of solid-phase gastric emptying rates were obtained by a gamma camera. Subjects were studied in the lying, sitting, standing, or combined sitting-standing postures. The results demonstrated that the lying position significantly slowed gastric emptying compared to all other positions. Conversely, a decrease in emptying times of 51% and 35% occurred in the combined sitting-standing position compared to the lying and sitting position. These results support a marked effect of body posture on the radionuclide measurement of gastric emptying.\r"

PCHE activity in the presence of metoclopramide, at concentrations of 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 micrograms.ml-1, was reduced to 0.78 +/- 0.02, 0.69 +/- 0.04, 0.50 +/- 0.03, 0.39 +/- 0.02, 0.24 +/- 0.01 and 0.15 +/- 0.01 unit.ml-1, respectively. Our data demonstrated that PCHE activity was significantly depressed by metoclopramide at all concentrations studied (p less than 0.001). Our data also show that the concentration of metoclopramide required to inhibit 50 per cent of PCHE activity (I50) was 0.8 micrograms.ml-1 (2.4 x 10(-6) M).

In order to analyze Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) recommendations for site of drug administration, we studied dye circulation times after central, femoral, and peripheral venous injection during both closed and open chest CPR using a canine arrest model. Measurements of circulation times were made after injection of indocyanine green dye at femoral, central, and peripheral venous sites. Circulation times during closed chest CPR were 62.7 +/- 19.6 sec after central injection, 86.6 +/- 23.5 sec after femoral injection, and 93.6 +/- 17.9 sec after peripheral injection (p less than .001). During closed chest CPR, peak dye concentration after central injection was significantly higher than that after peripheral injection (4.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.8 mg/L, p less than .01). Circulation times were significantly shorter during open chest CPR with times again shortest after central injection. This animal model suggests that prompt drug delivery during CPR is enhanced by central venous injection of medication. There appears to be no advantage in femoral over peripheral injection.\r"

Of the five living siblings, four were treated with etretinate for a period of at least 21 consecutive months. Clinical follow-up showed that the course of recurrent infections in susceptible PLS patients, although usually more severe in childhood, can be variable and unpredictable. The etretinate therapy resulted in marked improvement of the keratodermas, and was associated with complete remission of the pyodermas on both keratotic and non-keratotic skin. It is, therefore, suggested that etretinate may have a primary role in the prevention of recurrent pyogenic infections in susceptible PLS patients.\r"

Survival without the need for supplemental oxygen was chosen as a reflection of infants surviving without chronic lung disease. There were 1,776 live-born infants delivered during the 2-year study period. Of these infants, 85% (1,512) survived 28 days, a range of 80% to 92% at the individual centers. A total of 60% (1,056) of the infants were alive without supplemental oxygen on day 28, a range of 51% to 70% at the individual centers. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both survival on day 28 (chi 2 = 23.9, P less than .01) and survival without supplemental oxygen on day 28 (chi 2 = 44.2, P less than .0001) varied significantly among centers after the effects of birth weight, gender, and race were taken into account. Female gender, nonwhite race, and increased birth weight were factors associated with improved rates of survival and survival without supplemental oxygen. The magnitude of outcome variation among centers was estimated by using the logistic regression models to predict what the outcomes would be if each center were to treat a standardized population consisting of all 1,776 study infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty women and eight men underwent 16 unilateral fenestrations and 12 bilateral operations. Papilledema disappeared or was strikingly reduced in 24 of 28 patients. The other four patients had gliotic discs (two patients) or were followed up for only a short time. Visual acuity improved in 12 of 40 eyes and remained the same in 22 of 40 eyes. Seventeen eyes had preoperative visual acuity of 20/30 or better. In six eyes visual acuity decreased. Of eight eyes operated on that had visual acuity of 20/200 or worse, only three showed improvement. Visual fields improved in 21 of 40 eyes and remained the same in ten eyes. Five of the ten eyes that did not change had poor vision before surgery. Eight eyes in five patients continued to lose acuity postoperatively. Each of these eight eyes had a concomitant loss of visual field. An additional two eyes developed visual field loss with preserved visual acuity. The indications for surgery are early evidence of progressive loss of visual field or acuity in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri. Severe vision loss presents little opportunity for improvement but fenestration may be used in a last effort to preserve or restore vision.\r"

Rats in both groups were then allowed free access to feed and subdivided into exercise or non-exercise groups. Eight wk of treadmill exercise (speed, 24 m/min; duration, 75 min/d; frequency, 5 d/sk) reduced weight gain in both normal-fed and underfed rats, but had a greater effect on underfed rats. Underfed rats that were exercised gained 76% as much weight (carcass: 54% as much fat; 92% as much lean mass), and tended to have lighter tissues than underfed rats that were not exercised. Data suggest that treadmill exercise following a postweaning period of undernutrition reduces \"catch-up\" growth in rats.\r"

Results from these studies demonstrated that blood flow increased progressively up to VO2max in the gracilis, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles of the dog; however, blood flow to the gastrocnemius leveled off during submaximal exercise. These studies have also shown that the magnitude of the blood flow response to maximal exercise in the different muscles examined is extremely varied and that some muscle blood flows exceeded 300 ml.100 g-1.min-1. Whether or not these high blood flows were the consequence of microsphere streaming effects was evaluated, and results from both studies suggest that these effects were minimal. Also, the high muscle blood flows appeared to be reasonable with respect to the maximal cardiac outputs generated by the dogs in both studies. Based on the data presented we conclude that the radioactive microsphere technique appears to be a reliable technique for measuring muscle blood flow in the exercising dog. Moreover, the skeletal muscle blood flow response to exercise in the dog is variable and highly dependent on the individual muscle(s) studied.\r"

A multiple logistic regression model found each of these variables except duration of operation to to be independently associated with unplanned admission with admission included age, present or past medical conditions, use of medications, blood pressure, hematocrit, serum sodium or potassium, and ASA Class. Identification and modification of these factors may help anticipate and/or reduced the incidence of unplanned admission to the hospital in patients undergoing planned outpatient surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1983, we have conducted national surveillance of health care workers exposed to blood or body fluids from persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), to assess the risk of HIV transmission by such exposures. As of July 31, 1988, 1201 health care workers with blood exposures had been examined, including 751 nurses (63 percent), 164 physicians and medical students (14 percent), 134 laboratory workers (11 percent), and 90 phlebotomists (7 percent). The exposures resulted from needle-stick injuries (80 percent), cuts with sharp objects (8 percent), open-wound contamination (7 percent), and mucous-membrane exposure (5 percent). We concluded that 37 percent of the exposures might have been prevented. Of 963 health care workers whose serum has been tested for HIV antibody at least 180 days after exposure, 4 were positive, yielding a seroprevalence rate of 0.42 percent (upper limit of 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 percent). Three subjects experienced an acute retroviral syndrome associated with documented seroconversion; serum collected within 30 days of exposure was not available from the fourth person. Two exposures that resulted in seroconversion were caused by coworkers during resuscitation procedures. We conclude that the risk of HIV infection after exposure to the blood of a patient infected with HIV is low, but at least six months of follow-up is recommended. Many exposures can be prevented by careful adherence to existing infection-control precautions, even during emergencies.\r"

Seventy one patients with overt rectal bleeding had prospectively flexible sigmoidoscopy, double contrast barium enema and colonoscopy completed independently. Against the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of colonoscopy were 0.69 and 0.78 respectively for a spectrum of colonic lesions, while for combined flexible sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium enema these values were 0.80 and 0.56, respectively. When assessing adenoma or carcinoma, colonoscopy was more sensitive at 0.82 v 0.73, while flexible sigmoidoscopy plus double contrast barium enema was superior for detecting diverticular disease. The positive predictive value for colonoscopy was 0.87 against 0.81 for flexible sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium enema. This study confirms that colonoscopy should be a first line investigation in subjects likely to require biopsy or therapeutic intervention.\r"

Many surgeons have favored a pharyngeal flap as primary treatment of the velopharyngeal incompetence associated with this disorder. The increasing number of case reports of sleep apnea and airway compromise associated with pharyngeal flaps prompted the use of levator muscle repositioning with palatal lengthening as initial therapy in 15 patients in an attempt to correct the pathologic anatomy while avoiding the postoperative sequelae. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (N = 8) had surgery before age 2 (11.8 +/- 5.7 months), and group B (N = 7) had surgery after 2 years of age (64.3 +/- 24.2 months). No patient in group A required a secondary operative procedure for velopharyngeal incompetence. Normal speech was obtained in 75 percent (N = 6), and slight velopharyngeal incompetence not requiring secondary correction was obtained in 25 percent (N = 2). Group B obtained less dramatic speech results: normal in 14 percent (N = 1), slight velopharyngeal incompetence in 58 percent (N = 4), and no improvement or severe velopharyngeal incompetence requiring a secondary procedure in 28 percent (N = 2). Patients with preoperative otologic disorders (N = 10) obtained significant improvement in 90 percent of cases (p = 0.002). Early surgical intervention in patients with abnormal speech prior to age 2 appears to result in normal speech in the majority of instances. Late repair with levator repositioning and palatal lengthening provided improved speech in 72 percent of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone that inhibits rat uterine contractions. To test the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of this effect may involve shifts in calcium ions, the biologic action of relaxin on isolated rat uterine horns was directly correlated with measurements of 45Ca2+ efflux from and uptake into the tissues. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that the efflux of 45Ca2+ from rat uterine horns was significantly faster when tissue was incubated with 25 ng/ml relaxin as compared with control tissues incubated with no relaxin. In addition, at the end of the efflux experiments, control uteri contained 3.9% of the starting 45Ca2+, whereas the relaxin-treated uteri contained only 2.55%, indicating greater total Ca2+ efflux from the relaxin-treated horns (p less than 0.05). The effect of relaxin on 45Ca2+ uptake by uterine tissue was also studied. Analysis of uptake curves by linear regression demonstrated that relaxin treatment leads to less total uptake of 45Ca2+ in the uterine tissue, although the differences are not statistically significant. These experiments demonstrate that relaxin inhibition of rat uterine contractions in vitro is associated with a decrease in intracellular free Ca2+, caused, at least in part, by the promotion of Ca2+ efflux. These results represent the first step in defining the mechanism of action of this hormone.\r"

The number of OH prescriptions dispensed peaked in 1973, decreased through 1980, and has been increasing since that year. In 1986, OH agents accounted for 21.5 million prescriptions: 1% of all prescriptions dispensed that year. Chlorpropamide is currently the most frequently ingested OH agent; it is used by 33% of the market. The two OH agents introduced in 1984, glyburide and glipizide, had acquired 41% of the OH market by the end of 1986. The rate of OH use per 1000 diabetes mellitus visits increases with patient's age. Patients aged 60 yr and older received OH prescriptions at a rate of 478 per 1000 diabetes mellitus visits in 1986. Data estimating both the number of patients diagnosed with diabetes and the number of diabetic patients taking OH agents indicate that the percentage receiving OH treatment has increased over the past 5 yr, with approximately 35% of all diabetic patients taking OH agents in 1986.\r"

In the baseline period the home diet provided on average 6.28 MJ (1500 kcal) (SD 2.1 MJ (499 kcal] and 41 g (SD 13 g) of protein. The mean birthweight was 2835 g and the rate of low birthweight 12.2%. In the experimental period the home diet was better. The average intake ranged from 6.45 to 7.19 MJ (1541-1717 kcal) and 41.4-44.2 g per day, depending on the degree of compliance. Mean birthweight increased by 100 g and the rate of low birthweight dropped to 9.5%. There was no difference between the high and low energy supplemented group as a whole, probably due to the masking effect of the better home diet in the experimental period. It is likely that a positive effect of energy supplementation on birthweight was restricted to the group of pregnant women with the lowest home dietary intake and/or a low prepregnant weight. In this community targeting of supplementation to lean seasons and/or to women with a low prepregnant weight may be cost-effective.\r"

The right ovary was present in 98.9% of subjects and the left in 99.1%. The mean (SD; range) of right and left ovarian volumes were 3.58 (1.40; 1.00-14.01) and 3.57 (1.37; 0.88-10.9) ml respectively. Significant predictors of ovarian volume were years since the menopause, weight, parity, age at menopause, a history of hormone replacement therapy, and previously diagnosed breast cancer. Abnormal ovarian volumes were assessed from a score equal to the (observed mean log volume (MLV) minus the predicted MLV)/0.327. A simplified nomogram has been prepared for routine clinical use. The relative abnormality of one ovary was assessed from a ratio score equal to loge (larger ovarian volume/smaller ovarian volume)/0.211 compared with the 99th centile for the Gaussian distribution.\r"

Overall, heavy inflammatory infiltration correlated with a good prognosis and light infiltration with a poor one, independent of other indices such as differentiation, tumour size and nodal status. IgA-containing cell infiltration also correlated with a good prognosis but the presence of IgA-containing cells did not alone account for all the inflammation in the good prognosis group. An immunological response to the tumour may be influencing prognosis. At a practical level, the extent of inflammation appears, at least in this material, to be as useful a prognostic index as many more conventional ones.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo administration of murine recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) was evaluated for effects on survival and engraftment in an allogeneic murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model involving T-cell depletion of donor marrow. The model provides a high incidence of graft failure/rejection. Recipients of continuous subcutaneous infusions of rGM-CSF had a significant survival advantage when compared with untreated controls. However, a significantly lower incidence of donor cell engraftment was noted. Hematological parameters were not substantially affected. When rGM-CSF was administered intraperitoneally (IP), twice daily injections closely approximated the effects of continuous infusion on survival. Single IP injections were without significant effects on survival or engraftment. These results demonstrate that prolonged frequent in vivo exposure to rGM-CSF can significantly improve survival but significantly decreases donor cell repopulation in recipients of T-cell-depleted histoincompatible marrow grafts.\r"

Little is known about the mechanism of transformation of myeloma cells, although the clinical characteristics of the disease suggest a multi-step process. Recently, a myeloma cell line, NCI-H929, was isolated from a patient with aggressive preterminal disease and found to have a rearranged myc allele. This myeloma cell line has been further characterized in a focus formation assay to determine whether its unusual growth characteristics were associated with a second activated transforming gene. We now report that the NCI-H929 myeloma cell line has an activated rasn allele in addition to a rearranged myc allele. This is the first identification of an activated transforming gene in a multiple myeloma cell line; furthermore, the characterization of two independently activated oncogenes in this B cell malignancy has implications for both the pathogenesis and evolution of the disease.\r"

Thirty-eight patients received lymphocyte-depleted allografts from HLA-identical, MLR-nonreactive sibling donors. The patients entered onto the study were either at high risk on the basis of age (median, 39 years) or disease status (acute leukemia in early relapse [ER], chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] in accelerated phase [AP], or therapy resistant [RES] lymphoma). All patients received a standard lymphocyte dose of 1 x 10(6) morphologic lymphocytes per kilogram ideal body weight (BW) and were maintained on cyclosporine A (CsA) for 170 days after BMT. Prompt engraftment occurred in 37 of 38 patients with a median time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 500/microL of 18 days. Although acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD; clinical stage I or greater) was observed in 45%, it was limited to the skin in all but five patients. Survival was related to disease status at the time of BMT. Among patients with acute leukemia in first or second remission, CML in chronic phase (CP) or lymphoma in partial remission (PR), 64% are currently alive, in contrast to 31% of patients with acute leukemia in third remission or early relapse, CML in second CP or AP, or RES lymphoma. Median follow-up for all patients was 351 days (range, 105 to 711 days). We conclude that this procedure is safe and warrants further evaluation in a randomized efficacy trial.\r"

  ".W": "A technique of irradiating the entire mouse except for one hind limb was developed to provide repeated proliferative demand on the stem cell pool. Animals received 200 cGY weekly for a total dose of 3,400 to 4,000 cGy. During irradiation, shielded bone marrow cellularity was similar to that of unirradiated controls. Shielded marrow colony-forming unit (CFUs) content increased while marrow CFUs self renewal capacity decreased as compared with unirradiated age-matched controls. Following irradiation experimental animals were monitored monthly for 10 to 12 months for marrow cellularity, CFUs content, and self renewal capacity. Shielded marrow cellularity and CFUs content remained elevated over age-matched controls throughout the period of observation. These findings are compatible with the requirement of the shielded hind limb to provide hematopoietic support for the remainder of the animal. Shielded marrow self renewal capacity, a measurement reflecting primitive hematopoietic stem cell function, remained depressed and did not recover with time. These experiments provide evidence for there being limitations on the self renewal capacity of the stem cell compartment. While the small amount of shielded marrow had sufficient capacity to support the animal its average self renewal capacity was permanently reduced.\r"

  ".W": "Supernatants of cultured human thymic nonlymphoid cells were assayed for granulopoietic factors using cultures of low density bone marrow mononuclear cells (LD-BMMC). Thymic nonlymphoid cell-conditioned medium (TNLC-CM) supported vigorous myeloid colony growth of LD-BMMC, and of LD-BMMC depleted of T lymphocytes and/or monocytes. Colony stimulating activity (CSA) in TNLC-CM was abrogated by a highly specific neutralizing antiserum against recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). TNLC-CM also enhanced colony growth in LD-BMMC stimulated by colony stimulating activity from a giant cell tumor culture (GCT). The enhancing activity of TNLC-CM, unlike its CSA activity, required the presence of adherent cells in the marrow cell culture. The addition of anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) antibody to TNLC-CM inhibited the GCT-enhancing activity, but not the CSA. When the anti-IL-1 immunoglobulin was added directly to cultures of thymic nonlymphoid cells, GM-CSF production was completely inhibited, and the GCT enhancing activity was neutralized. We conclude that an intercellular regulatory network exists in cultured thymic explants in which GM-CSF expression is induced by IL-1. In this system, the granulopoietic effect of IL-1 derives not from a direct effect on myeloid progenitors, but from its ability to recruit CSA production by other cells.\r"

Both cell lines expressed the same IgM, kappa phenotype as the original lymphoma. The karyotype of Es I was 46, XY, t(8;14), 2 p+, inv (6p), 17p-, and the cells of Es III had an additional i(7q). Immunoglobulin gene studies demonstrated the identical monoclonal rearrangements in both cell lines. Neither EBV nor HIV sequences were detectable in the malignant B cells at the genomic level, leading to the conclusion that mechanisms other than transformation by EBV or HIV may have contributed to the B-cell lymphoma in this patient and possibly also to the generally increased frequency in patients with AIDS.\r"

MR-87 cells grew in single cell suspensions with a doubling time of 120 to 144 hours. Both MR-87 and original leukemia cells were positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and myeloid antigen CD13. These cells exhibited the early B-cell phenotype, ie, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase+, Ia+, CD19+, and CD10+. Rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain was confirmed in both. Approximately 80% of MR-87 cells coexpressed CD13 and lymphoid antigens CD10 or CD19, as confirmed by a two-color analysis. Simultaneous expression of MPO and CD19 on a single MR-87 cell was demonstrated at ultrastructural level. Thus, MR-87 is a Ph+ leukemia cell line exhibiting a hybrid phenotype. The breakpoint cluster region (bcr) was not rearranged in the MR-87 cells and subsequent analysis using antisera revealed that these cells expressed a novel protein, P190c-abl, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-abl and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The MR-87 line will be most useful for investigating the biology and pathogenesis of Ph+ bcr- acute leukemia.\r"

  ".U": "89001190\r", 
  ".W": "In view of reported attempts at marrow grafting after nuclear accidents with a broad range of radiation exposures, the present study explored the total-body irradiation (TBI) conditions needed for engraftment in a canine model by using marrow from DLA-identical littermates. Previous studies have shown that such grafts are consistently successful when recipients are exposed to 920 cGy of TBI delivered at a rate of 7 cGy/min from opposing dual cobalt sources. The present TBI doses were all in the lethal range. Five dogs were administered 450 cGy; seven dogs, 600 cGy; five dogs, 700 cGy; and five dogs, 800 cGy of TBI administered at 7 cGy/min. They received a median of 3.3 x 10(8) marrow cells/kg intravenously after completion of radiation. Results showed transient allogeneic marrow engraftment in all dogs administered the lowest dose of TBI studied (450 cGy). Importantly, transient grafts permitted four of five dogs to live long enough for autologous marrow recovery to occur. At increasing radiation doses, 600, 700, and 800 cGy, the risk of graft failure lessened, with 3 of 7, 2 of 5, and 1 of 5 dogs, respectively, showing graft rejection. Fewer dogs survived with autologous marrow recovery, and more showed sustained allogeneic engraftment (4 of 7, 3 of 5, and 4 of 5 dogs, respectively). We conclude that DLA-identical littermate marrow grafts are beneficial in the setting of otherwise lethal radiation exposures, with most dogs either experiencing sustained allogeneic engraftment or surviving with autologous marrow recovery due to the extended support provided by a transient allogeneic graft.\r"

However, we found that leukocyte counts declined rapidly after discontinuation of rHuGM-CSF therapy, which suggests possible growth factor effects on leukocyte margination and migration. For these reasons we studied granulocyte margination by using 111In-labeled autologous granulocytes and found similar granulocyte margination before (21.5% +/- 13.4%) and during continuous IV rHuGM-CSF infusion (23.3% +/- 9.6%). Phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans and granulocyte hydrogen peroxide production was similar before and during rHuGM-CSF infusion and similar to patients treated with the same high-dose chemotherapy and ABMS but not receiving growth factor. However, migration of granulocytes to a sterile inflammatory site was markedly reduced during continuous rHuGM-CSF infusion (1.2 +/- 0.9 WBCs/cm2, 24 hr) as compared with baseline (39.6 +/- 17.7 WBCs/cm2/24 hr; P less than .0008). These findings may be of relevance when extravascular granulocytes are required for host defense.\r"

  ".W": "Although the genes for four hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) have been cloned, neither the mechanism of the regulation of their production nor their cellular origins have been established with certainty. Monocytes are known to produce colony-stimulating and burst-promoting activities, as well as several monokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These monokines indirectly stimulate other mesenchymal cells to produce certain colony-stimulating factors such as granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). To determine whether monocytes produce other CSFs and if so, to compare the mechanism of regulation of production with that of endothelial cells and fibroblasts, we investigated the synthesis of CSFs by monocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. We used total cellular RNA blot analysis to determine interleukin-3 (IL-3), GM-CSF, granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), and monocyte CSF (M-CSF) messenger RNA (mRNA) content and immunoprecipitation or bioassay to confirm the presence of the specific secreted proteins. The results indicate that M-CSF mRNA and protein are produced constitutively by all three cell types and their level of expression does not increase after induction. In contrast, GM-CSF and G-CSF mRNAs are barely detectable in uninduced monocytes and show an increase in expression after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Retrovirus-immortalized endothelial cells, unlike primary endothelial cells or both primary and immortalized fibroblasts, produce IL-1 constitutively; this correlates with their constitutive production of GM-CSF and G-CSF. IL-3 mRNA was not detectable in any of these cells either before or after induction. The results indicate that these mesenchymal cells can produce three CSFs: GM-CSF, G-CSF, and M-CSF; furthermore, the data suggest that the mechanism of regulation of M-CSF production is different from that of GM-CSF and G-CSF, and that the latter two inducible CSFs are regulated by different factors in monocytes compared with the other mesenchymal cells.\r"

  ".W": "Canine cyclic hematopoiesis (CH) is an autosomal recessive disease of gray collie dogs that is characterized by neutropenic episodes at 14-day intervals. The biochemical basis for CH is not known but may involve a regulatory defect of the response to or production of a hematopoietic growth factor. Administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) to two CH and one normal dog caused a marked leukocytosis (greater than 50,000 WBCs) in all three dogs. The leukocytosis was due largely to a greater than tenfold increase in neutrophils. Less pronounced but significant elevations in monocytes occurred during G-CSF treatment. The elevated WBC count was maintained for more than 20 days in all three dogs, and two predicted neutropenic episodes were prevented in both CH dogs during rhG-CSF treatment. A decline in the WBC count occurred simultaneously in all three dogs during the last five treatment days and was presumably associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies to the heterologous rhG-CSF protein. Bone marrow evaluation indicated that the swings in the myeloid/erythroid progenitor cells that are characteristic of CH were eliminated by rhG-CSF treatment in both CH dogs. These results suggest that the regulatory defect in canine CH can be temporarily alleviated by treatment with rhG-CSF and point to the potential treatment of human cyclic neutropenia with this agent.\r"

GM-CSF messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected in the freshly obtained mononuclear cells of only one of 48 cases of AML, in contrast with recent reports that GM-CSF mRNA might be detected in half of the cases of AML when RNA is prepared from T-cell- and monocyte-depleted leukemic cells. We did find, however, that expression of the GM-CSF gene was detectable in five of ten cases after in vitro T-cell and monocyte depletion steps. Additional studies suggest that expression of GM-CSF in the bone marrow of the one positive case, rather than being autonomous, was under exogenous control, possibly by a paracrine factor secreted by marrow stromal cells. These studies emphasize the potential for altering in vivo patterns of gene expression by in vitro cell manipulation.\r"

The assay is quantitative between 100 pg/mL and 2.5 ng/mL for bacterially synthesized hGM-CSF in human serum and is more sensitive and specific than the semisolid agar bioassay. As part of a phase I study, the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) bolus injection and subcutaneous (SC) administration of hGM-CSF were studied. Following a single IV dose, an initial high blood level of hGM-CSF occurred, followed by a rapid decrease occurring in two apparent phases with a half-life (t1/2)alpha of less than five minutes and a t1/2 beta of 150 minutes. After an SC injection, detectable serum levels occurred within 15 to 30 minutes, and serum levels were sustained for a variable time depending on the dose. At the highest SC dose (10 micrograms/kg), a serum level of greater than 1 ng/mL (65 pmol/L) was maintained for greater than 12 hours after a single injection. This corresponds to the concentration of hGM-CSF supporting near-maximum proliferation in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells to elaborate heterogeneous hematopoietic growth factors, including granulocyte-macrophage and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF and G-CSF, respectively). Because erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) is also elaborated by endothelial cells exposed to IL-1, we sought to determine whether the BPA released by IL-1-induced endothelial cells simply reflects the known erythropoietic activity of GM-CSF or whether other uncharacterized factors might be involved. Media conditioned by multiply passaged endothelial cells cultured for three days with recombinant IL-1 alpha (ECMIL-1) stimulated erythroid burst and GM colony formation in cultures of human nonadherent T-lymphocyte-depleted marrow mononuclear cells. Pretreatment with an anti-GM-CSF antiserum neutralized all the BPA and 56% of the GM colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA) in ECMIL-1. The antiserum used in these studies did not inhibit IL-3 or G-CSF activity and did not inhibit ECMIL-1-induced murine GM colony growth (a measure of human G-CSF). To examine whether GM-CSF induces BPA release by accessory cells, media conditioned by marrow cells cultured for three days with GM-CSF were tested in the colony growth assays. Pretreatment with anti-GM-CSF antiserum completely neutralized the BPA and GM-CSA of the marrow cell-conditioned medium. We conclude that GM-CSF is the BPA elaborated by IL-1-induced endothelial cells. The in vitro erythropoietic activity of GM-CSF is not dependent on induced BPA release by accessory cells and therefore likely results from a direct effect of GM-CSF on progenitor cells.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) of recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and Interleukin-3 (IL-3) with two experimental approaches. First we studied the effects of polyclonal antisera prepared against human GM-CSF and gibbon IL-3 on colony formation from 1,000 bone marrow null cells/dish in serum-containing culture. Both GM-CSF and IL-3 independently enhanced erythroid burst formation; however, IL-3 showed more BPA activity than GM-CSF. These data are in agreement with an emerging view that the primary targets of IL-3 are primitive progenitors and that the targets of GM-CSF are intermediate progenitors, including erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E). The proliferation of one population of BFU-E was independent of GM-CSF or IL-3. To characterize this population of BFU-E further, we developed a serum-free culture assay for the purified progenitors by incorporating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to the serum-free medium. The development of erythroid bursts was supported by IL-3, IGF-1, and erythropoietin (Ep) in a serum-free culture system and to a lesser extent by the combination of GM-CSF, IGF-1, and Ep. Although the burst-promoting ability of GM-CSF and IL-3 was again demonstrated in this system, unlike serum-containing culture Ep alone did not support burst formation. These results indicate that when fetal calf serum (FCS) is present, the culture system contains BPA that is not GM-CSF or IL-3.\r"

The source of progenitor cells was normal human marrow depleted of T lymphocytes and/or adherent cells. When adherent cell-depleted marrow was cultured without growth factors, the number of progenitor cells was relatively constant for periods up to eight days. In contrast, a progressive decline in the number of progenitor cells was detected in cultures of nonadherent, T-cell-depleted marrow cells. In both cases, the addition of IL-3 increased by two- to fourfold over input the number of erythroid burst-forming cells (BFU-E) per culture. The number of BFU-E peaked either at day 4 or 8. G-CSF had no effect on the number of progenitor cells per culture. GM-CSF and Ep had no effect in cultures of nonadherent marrow cells but maintained the number of BFU-E in cultures of nonadherent, T-cell-depleted marrow cells. The addition of a neutralizing anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, but not anti-IL-3 neutralizing antiserum, decreased the number of BFU-E in cultures of nonadherent marrow cells. None of the growth factors investigated enhanced the number of GM progenitors to the same degree as the number of BFU-E. However, in cultures of nonadherent, T-cell-depleted marrow cells, IL-3 and GM-CSF maintained the number of GM progenitors up to eight days. These results indicate that IL-3 alone is capable of increasing the number of BFU-E and of maintaining the number of GM progenitors in liquid culture, whereas GM-CSF and Ep are capable of maintaining, but not increasing, BFU-E in this system.\r"

We found that NHLs and LLs differentially express LFA-1 molecules according to their lineage derivation, degree of clinical aggressiveness, and anatomic site of involvement. Specifically, (a) T-cell neoplasms nearly always express these molecules; (b) diffuse aggressive B-cell NHLs and mature LLs often lack LFA-1 alpha molecules; and (c) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is often LFA-1 alpha-negative while B-cell small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLLs) are nearly always LFA-1 alpha-positive. Furthermore, the low expression of LFA-1 alpha in CLL is related to the low degree of homotypic lymphocyte adhesion after tumor promoter antigen stimulation that does not modulate the expression of LFA-1 alpha in vitro. The differential expression of LFA-1 by B-cell CLL and SLL and their degree of homotypic lymphocyte adhesion may account for the distinct anatomic compartmentalization and characteristic clinical behavior of these two morphologically and immunologically similar lymphoid malignancies.\r"

This technique involves scanning the entire length of the graft but allows even minor stenoses to be detected and progression of stenoses can be determined. At a mean follow-up of 12 months (3-18 months), four (7 per cent) of the fifty-six grafts without stenoses occluded. Eight (42 per cent) of the nineteen stenosed grafts either occluded or developed symptoms. None of the occluded grafts in this series could be salvaged.

The rate of control of acute bleeding was 100 per cent (6/6) in the ethanolamine group and 75 per cent (3/4) in the STD group.

The disappearance rate of red colour signs 1 week after the initial session of sclerotherapy in the ethanolamine group was 100 per cent and 62 per cent in the STD group. Early oesophageal ulcers developed less frequently in the ethanolamine group (0 and 9 per cent) than in the STD group (24 per cent and 43 per cent both after the initial (P less than 0.05) and the second session of sclerotherapy (P less than 0.01]. Early bleeding from an oesophageal ulcer occurred only in the STD group (5/21, 24 per cent) before the third session of sclerotherapy (P less than 0.05). The rate of early mortality did not differ between the two groups. We conclude that ethanolamine seems to be safer and more efficacious than STD for sclerosing oesophageal varices.\r"

Of 157 patients with early breast cancer (stage I and II) and 199 patients with advanced breast cancer (stage III and IV), 73 per cent and 87 per cent respectively had elevated MSA levels (i.e. greater than 300 inhibition units (IU). Furthermore, 40 of 44 patients (91 per cent) had a significant fall of MSA levels with reduction in tumour load by mastectomy. In addition, there was a correlation of MSA levels with the clinical course: changes in MSA levels correlated with changes in disease status (progressive disease, stable disease, disease regression) in 54 of 61 patients and antedated disease progression or recurrence by up to 8 months in some patients; and in 32 of 36 patients (89 per cent) with no clinical evidence of recurrence MSA levels did not vary by more than 25 per cent of the original MSA value over a period of 2-15 months. MSA is therefore a useful tumour marker in the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer. There is also evidence that serial estimations of MSA levels may be used to detect subclinical recurrence and the fluctuations in MSA levels might be useful in assessing response to therapy. Furthermore, it was also noted that surgical procedures such as fine needle aspiration biopsy or incisional biopsy could lead to a rise in MSA levels.\r"

Transfer by air has many advantages for the seriously burned patient provided that all potential risk factors are taken into account. There is a need to consider infection, the respiratory condition and the cardiovascular status of the patient. The possibility of other injuries should also be borne in mind. Early transfer requires careful but urgent planning if it is to be achieved, as is desirable, by days 3 or 4 postburn. Transfer during or at the end of the resuscitation phase, or in the convalescent phase when skin cover is well established, poses least problems. Plenty of sterile paraffin gauze, wool and crepe bandages will be needed. Appropriate monitoring equipment and full cardiovascular and respiratory resuscitation facilities should be carried. Care should be taken in the selection of the medical and nursing personnel to accompany the patient, who should whenever possible have experience of burns as well as aviation medicine.\r"

Nearly all these complications occur during the first week after the burn. For patients in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with burns above 50 per cent BSA the prognosis is usually poor unless the pregnancy is terminated within 24-48 h after the burn.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary considerations play an important role in the diagnosis, treatment and management of immunologic and nonimmunologic reactions to foods. Food diaries and trial elimination diets may prove helpful in identifying the responsible foods. Elimination diets must be monitored carefully for nutritional adequacy and should be used no longer than absolutely necessary; in some instances appropriate vitamin and mineral supplementation may be necessary. Ideally the identification of foods that provoke symptoms should be confirmed by means of double-blind challenge testing. Avoidance of some problem foods is unlikely to cause nutritional problems, but the practical and nutritional implications of allergies to staple foods such as cow's milk, eggs and wheat are far greater. Nonimmunologic adverse reactions that may mimic food allergic reactions include gastrointestinal disorders, sensitivity to food additives and psychologically based adverse reactions. There may be some degree of tolerance in metabolic disorders, which makes dietary management easier. Sensitivity to food additives necessitates careful scrutiny of food labels. In psychologic adverse reactions to foods, several foods are often involved, which increases the risk of nutritional problems.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied 11 pediatric intrathoracic neoplasms that share clinicopathologic features and constitute a specific tumor in children. These neoplasms were intrapulmonary, mediastinal, or pleural-based masses. A common histologic feature was the presence of small, primitive cells with blastematous qualities separated by an uncommitted stroma. Focal rhabdomyosarcomatous, chondrosarcomatous, and liposarcomatous differentiation was observed. Epithelial components had bland cytologic features and probably represented entrapped benign epithelium and/or mesothelium. The prognosis for these patients was grave; seven patients died of their disease 5 months to 2 years after diagnosis. Two patients have survived disease-free for 10 and 12 years after diagnosis. Two recent cases are alive 14 and 32 months after diagnosis. This neoplasm constitutes a distinct entity which has been reported in the literature as pulmonary blastoma in children. It differs from pulmonary blastoma in adults because of its variable anatomic location, primitive embryonic-like blastema and stroma, absence of a carcinomatous component, and potential for sarcomatous differentiation. The designation of pleuropulmonary blastoma is suggested by the authors for these intrathoracic neoplasms of childhood rather than pulmonary blastoma for histogenetic and anatomic reasons. The clinicopathologic features, immunophenotypic and ultrastructural characteristics, possible histogenesis, and differential diagnosis of these neoplasms from other thoracopulmonary tumors in children serve as the basis for this report.\r"

Median follow-up was 41 months (range, 33 to 48 months). Three of the 13 tumors (23%) had an identifiable aneuploid peak. Of the four tumors that recurred or metastasized, only one was aneuploid. Nuclear antigen analysis of all diploid tumors showed enhanced p105 expression in G2M phase cells compared to G0G1 cells. The G2M/G0G1 fluorescence ratio for p105 was consistently higher (P less than 0.05) for the three diploid tumors that recurred (median, 1.32 arbitrary fluorescence units; range, 1.27 to 1.80) than for the seven nonrecurrent diploid tumors (median, 1.20 arbitrary fluorescent units; range 1.14 to 1.22). These findings indicate a low incidence of DNA aneuploidy among pituitary tumors and suggest that for diploid adenomas, measurement of p105 may provide information useful in predicting prognosis and directing postoperative adjuvant therapy.\r"

In an attempt to characterize some of these mechanisms, we report controlled studies of humoral immune responses and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses in lung cancer patients with Stage I and Stage II adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer receiving pure tumor-associated antigen (TAA) specific active immunotherapy or combination immunochemotherapy. At 5 to 6 months postimmunotherapy, the humoral immune response measurements are predictive of response to therapy/survival in early lung cancer patients, permitting decisions as to whether to continue therapy. Patients with adenocarcinoma respond to combination chemoimmunotherapy by showing stronger or earlier responses to tests of immunity. Cell-mediated immunity to TAA at 17 to 24 months was far greater in patients receiving immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy compared with control patients, and also correlated with early humoral immune response and with 5-year survival. Here we report a further subset analysis of Stage I and Stage II lung cancer patients in a successful Phase III US specific active immunotherapy trial as substantiating the experience with Stage I patients in a successful Phase II Canadian trial. We analyze failures and suggest additional therapies, especially a chemoimmunotherapy trial indicated by our analyses of humorocellular immune variables reported here.\r"

The term \"interim\" implies that these recommendations should be regarded as temporary, pending more definitive findings from additional scientific research. This article reviews findings relevant to the connections between diet and cancer that have emerged from nutritional epidemiology subsequent to the 1982 the NRC report. Some recent research has supported the earlier work which served as a basis for the interim recommendations, some has not, and additional hypotheses have emerged. There continues to be evidence, although it is inconsistent, that dietary fat may be an important factor in colon cancer, and that something related to fruits and vegetables, perhaps carotene, may lower the risk of lung cancer. However, the hypothesized relationships between dietary fat and breast cancer and between dietary fiber and colon cancer have been less consistently supported by new findings. Meanwhile, a new hypothesis has emerged relating alcohol intake to breast cancer risk, although many important questions remain regarding the age at which alcohol use may affect risk, and the dose above which risk is increased. The last 5 years seem to have been characterized by only slow progress in our understanding of the relationship between diet and cancer. It is clear that in 1988 we are still very much in the interim. Critical methodologic assessments of the reasons for the discrepancies in findings among the various studies, and meta analytic approaches may be helpful in increasing our understanding of the set of epidemiologic research conducted to date. More important, however, are the many types of studies now underway, including more rigorously designed observational studies and chemo-preventive and dietary-preventive trials. These studies will likely provide more definitive future answers to the questions we still face in the interim.\r"

  ".U": "89002644\r", 
  ".W": "The various types of electromagnetic radiation differ considerably in their ability to induce cancer. The potential of radiofrequency or microwave radiation and low-frequency electromagnetic radiation to alter DNA is very limited, because their energy is too low to produce substantial ionizations. They are therefore unlikely to be carcinogenic by any direct mechanism. Epidemiologic studies of the carcinogenicity of microwave radiation are basically negative. Studies of workers with relatively high exposures to low-frequency electromagnetic fields have suggested that such persons may be at somewhat elevated risk for leukemia, especially of the acute myeloid type, but the studies have had methodologic weaknesses and mixed results. The association is not proven at this point, but neither can it be ruled out. For ionizing radiation, which is clearly carcinogenic, major questions pertain to how to define the magnitude of risk from low doses and low dose rates, how to identify subgroups of people who are especially susceptible to the effects of ionizing radiation, and how to minimize radiation exposure. When fortuitous radiation exposure from manmade sources, such as radioactive releases from nuclear power plants, are examined in the context of the total exposure people receive from natural sources, medical irradiation, etc., they are almost always found to be small by comparison. Quantitatively, two sources of radiation provide the greatest opportunities for exposure reduction: abatement of radon levels in homes, and reduction in medical radiation exposures.\r"

Liver cancers have been reported in users of androgenic anabolic steroids, and both hepatic cell adenomas and carcinomas have been associated with use of combined oral contraceptives.

  ".W": "The purpose of this paper is to clarify the short-term and long-term objectives of screening for various cancers, and to indicate the kinds of data that are needed to determine whether or not the objectives are met. Cancers at various sites differ with respect to their innate suitability for screening. Criteria that enhance screening suitability include the potential for serious complications and a high rate of mortality (applicable to most cancers), a prolonged preclinical phase, and an existing therapy that is simpler and more effective in reducing the mortality rate when applied to preclinical disease than to clinically evident cancer. Tests and procedures suitable for screening are simple to perform, inexpensive, acceptable to patients and physicians, safe, relatively painless, and accurate, as measured by the test's sensitivity and specificity. The actual yield of previously undiagnosed cancer arising from a screening program will depend heavily on prevalence of disease in the screened population, specificity of the screening test, and successful follow-up of screen-positive patients with diagnosis and treatment. These issues are discussed in the context of four cancers and their respective screening modalities: cervical cancer and cytologic studies, breast cancer and mammography, colon cancer and fecal occult blood tests, and lung cancer and sputum cytologic studies. The quality of data on which screening decisions have been made for each of these cancers and tests varies. The cancers vary in terms of their relevant biologic characteristics and treatment effectiveness. Similarly, each screening procedure has its own particular advantages and disadvantages. Current American Cancer Society Guidelines for early detection of three of the cancers are presented.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer prevention and risk reduction in patients with carcinomas of the urinary tract are most easily identified by smoking cessation. Recent assessments of patients with bladder carcinomas show a high percentage of active smokers. Urologic surgeons and those dealing with cancers of the genitourinary tract should recognize such an important factor. In other lifestyle guidelines, the American Cancer Society suggests that those who significantly reduce the fat content of their diet with weight reduction will generally reduce risk factors in a number of cancers, including prostate cancer. Many new diagnostic tests have been introduced since the 1980 conference. Transrectal ultrasonography as a preoperative staging technique has been received with some enthusiasm. Currently, a national program for the testing of the detection of prostate cancer by ultrasound compared with other physical examinations and marker antigens, such as prostate antigen, is underway. The evaluation of renal masses continues to be improved by the use of ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scanning. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are believed to have added some improved assessment for particularly large tumors and the question of their vascular extension. Occasionally observed lesions of the adrenal gland without hormonal expression in patients continue to be noticed during evaluations for frequently unrelated diagnoses. The management of such lesions less than 3.5 cm in diameter is believed to be conservative based on their size. Preoperative staging of the bladder has improved with transurethral ultrasonography use and the follow-up with patients has developed more frequently with the widely available urinary cytology. Fine needle aspiration of the prostate gland, lymph nodes, and other urinary tumor masses is increasing in diagnostic use. Flow cytometry has been applied to all lesions of the urinary tract and continues to be a field of clinical investigation. The field of biologic markers in diagnosis, detection, and follow-up evaluation of patients with carcinomas of the urinary tract is a most interesting and progressive one. Currently, the most widely accepted new innovation is the prostate antigen, which was developed by members of the National Prostatic Cancer Project between 1975 and 1986. Other markers offer potential added value in more accurate and earlier diagnosis and detection and correlation with prognostic factors concerning individual groups of patients. Progress in the detection, diagnosis, and management of genitourinary cancer is being achieved, and prevention, although perhaps simplistic in design, can be more readily applied.\r"

Some 24 clinical trials are ongoing in chemoprevention to assess the role of specific chemicals (natural and synthetic) in preventing, inhibiting, or reversing carcinogenesis. In diet and nutrition, several macronutrient trials are underway. The most significant of these is examining the relationship between dietary fat and breast cancer. In 1982, the NCI initiated a broad intervention research effort in smoking and tobacco use which has resulted in 46 prevention and clinical trials covering 25 states and more than 200 cities. More recently, a North American community-based intervention trial was begun to test cessation strategies for heavy smokers in 22 different sites. All of these intervention research efforts are testing strategies which later can be applied to large target population thereby supporting NCI's ambitious goal to reduce cancer mortality in this nation 50% by the year 2000.\r"

In a previous trial DDP produced 15% of responders and 5% of high-level toxic manifestations. The eligible patients with an advanced head and neck cancer were paired off successively on the basis of the tumour site and the UICC stage. DDP (100 mg/m2; day 1) was administered with hyperhydration, alone in the first protocol and followed by a 5-day continuous infusion of 5-FU (1 g/m2) in the second one. Courses were repeated every three weeks. Assessment was carried out after three courses or two, in cases of toxic manifestations. Seventy-four patients, who were paired off, entered the trial. The median age was 55 years and the median Karnofsky index was 90. The tumor site was as follows: 28 hypopharynx, 28 oropharynx, 8 oral cavity, and 10 multiple primary cancers. According to the UICC stage, there were 14 T1/T2 N3, 60 T3/T4 with among them 45 N3, and they were all MO. Comparisons were made through sequential closed plans. The combination chemotherapy was more efficacious than DDP with a difference that could be appreciated by the sequential analysis as high as 60% (95% confidence interval, 38% to 82%). The high-level toxicity appeared more significant (+25%) for the association. After radiation therapy 11 of 37 patients (30%) achieved a complete response in the arm with DDP versus 18 of 37 (49%) in that with DDP + FU. The median survival times were 9 and 11.5 months, respectively, and were not statistically different.\r"

Thirty-two patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and 85 were treated by local methods alone. The chemotherapy protocols featured doxorubicin (25 patients) or VAC (seven patients). The no chemotherapy patients were controls matched for tumor grade and size and were treated over approximately the same period. The two groups were not well matched for age: median age of 38.5 and 54 years for the treated and control groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival. However, the time to first metastasis was longer in the treated group, P = 0.04. Furthermore, the local failure rate appeared to be lower in the treated group, P = 0.06.\r"

  ".W": "Interrelationships of immunologic and enzymatic markers of histiocytes have been studied in malignant neoplasms of histiocytic/monocytic origin and in differential diagnostically relevant, large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Cryostat sections required for demonstrating cell surface antigens by monoclonal antibodies are inadequate for studying cellular detail, enzymatic maturation by alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), and demonstrating the classical cytoplasmic markers of histiocytes like lysozyme, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AT), and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT). These markers have been compared in gently fixed and vacuum paraffin-embedded material. The reactivity for monoclonal anti-human monocyte 1 (Mo 1) has also been preserved by this method. Malignant histiocytosis (MH) is characterized by a heterogeneous cell population. The mature, ANAE-positive cells with macrophage morphology usually show a diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for AT and ACT. Lysozyme is moderately positive to negative in these cells, but it is more efficient than these markers in revealing smaller cells resembling monocytes by focal positivity in the cytoplasm. The expression of Factor XIIIa (F-XIIIa) is connected with the phagocytic activation of histiocytic cells. F-XIIIa positive cells usually form a minority of the neoplastic population in MH, but the large cytophagocytic marcophages are invariably positive. Reactive macrophages in large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are characterized by a coexpression of ANAE, AT, ACT, lysozyme, F-XIIIa and Mo 1. Typical cases of true histiocytic lymphoma (THL) are made up of a homogeneous population showing the above mature, phagocytizing phenotype. In MH, Mo 1 and ANAE recognize different subpopulations. The reciprocal relation of these markers is an abnormal phenotypic feature. The results presented in this article prove the diagnostic value of ANAE and lysozyme in confirming the histiocytic differentiation of malignant cells. Monoclonal anti-human monocyte 1 is useful for identifying the immature component in MH. Factor XIIIa can be considered a functional marker of mature phagocytic histiocytes and an aid in the diagnosis of THL.\r"

AFP was present in 17% of the hepatocellular carcinomas, in 7% of the metastatic carcinomas, and in none of the cholangiocarcinomas. AAT was present in 41% of the hepatocellular carcinomas, in 37% of the cholangiocarcinomas, and in 50% to 70% of the metastatic carcinomas of the liver. Intracytoplasmic CEA was found in 75% of the cholangiocarcinomas, in 92% to 100% of the metastatic carcinomas, and in only one of the mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas. ERY-1 was present in 89% of the hepatocellular carcinomas, whereas none of the cholangiocarcinomas or metastatic carcinomas stained for this marker. We conclude that immunohistochemical assays for AFP and AAT are of limited value in the differential diagnosis of hepatic tumors. However, immunohistochemical stains for ERY-1 and CEA can be valuable in differentiating hepatocellular carcinomas from metastatic tumors.\r"

The EST component showed the classic histologic features of this tumor. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was not determined. Tumor stains were negative for AFP but positive for alpha-1-antitrypsin. The malignant germ cell component was intimately associated with the benign mucinous component. Focal production of epithelial mucin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the EST component suggested a probable association between the two tumor types. The tumor was confined to one ovary, and the patient is disease-free 2 years after surgical therapy. This neoplasm is unique not only for the malignant germ cell component occurring in an 82-year-old woman, but for the unusual combination of tumor types. The pathogenesis is unknown.\r"

With few exceptions, the evaluation of patients with end-stage heart failure is the same, regardless of the etiology. In those with cardiomyopathy not as a result of CAD, special attention must be given to exclude secondary causes of cardiomyopathy such as amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and sarcoidosis, as well as generalized systemic illnesses that may also involve the heart, either secondary or hereditary, because special consideration must be given to these patients on a case-by-case basis to determine that there is no general systemic involvement of the illness that would preclude satisfactory rehabilitation after transplantation. Before cardiac transplantation becomes widely available, there must be a greater number of donor hearts, the lack of which now severely limits the number of transplants performed in comparison with the estimated need.66 Additionally, more effective and specific immunosuppressive agents must be identified in order to reduce the incidence of rejection, infection, and accelerated atherosclerosis that now limits the longevity of transplant recipients. Furthermore, the ideal immunosuppressive agent should be associated with fewer side effects than those currently available. The emotional and economic burdens placed on the patient, the family, and society must be balanced against the benefits generated by the procedure. Despite these limitations, cardiac transplantation continues to offer hope for the terminally ill patient, which must be tempered by an understanding of the real limitations of transplantation.\r"

Heart failure is characterized by exertional dyspnea and fatigue, but the precise mechanisms that produce these symptoms are still not clear. Sodium retention occurs early in heart failure, but this disturbance is dynamic in nature and is not always present in the patient. The mechanism of early salt and water retention in heart failure is not defined. Gross edema and ascites occur much later, undoubtedly owing to the convergence of a number of factors. The peripheral adaptations to heart failure include activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system, and the release of AVP. The result is an increase in preload with a resultant increase in stroke volume for some patients, but the price is paid in the form of heightened impedance to ejection and circulatory congestion. The sympathetic nervous system disturbances in heart failure are striking, as disturbances in both circulating and myocardial NE levels are consistently found. Vasorelaxant and natriuretic hormones, as well as certain prostaglandins, may be released in an attempt to offset excessive \"compensatory\" pressor-sodium retentive mechanisms, but the net result seems to be excessive peripheral vasoconstriction and a downward spiral of deterioration in many patients. One would hope that an unraveling of the complex pathophysiology of heart failure would lead to therapy that would change the natural history of the disease. The results of the first V-HeFT trial give room for cautious optimism in this regard.\r"

This study investigated the effect of pH adjustment of 0.5 per cent bupivacaine immediately prior to epidural anaesthesia for Caesarean section. Addition of 0.1 ml of 8.4 per cent sodium bicarbonate to 20 ml of 0.5 per cent bupivacaine consistently raised the pH of the local anaesthetic from 5.49 to 7.04 (mean values). One hundred patients, presenting for elective Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia participated in the study. Forty patients received epidural anaesthesia, using pH-adjusted 0.5 per cent bupivacaine, in a dosage adequate to produce block to the T4 level. A control group of 40 patients received the standard commercial preparation of 0.5 per cent bupivacaine. A further ten patients in each group received epidural anaesthesia using 0.5 per cent bupivacaine with the addition of 1:400,000 epinephrine, to study the effect of epinephrine on pH adjustment of the local anaesthetic. Elevation of the pH of the local anaesthetic significantly increased the speed of onset of action from 6.4 minutes to 3.2 minutes and the time to peak effect from 24.8 minutes to 18.1 minutes, while the duration of anaesthesia was increased from 124.8 minutes to 147.3 minutes. The time to S2 segment blockade was also shortened from 13.5 to 8.6 minutes. Addition of 1:400,000 epinephrine to the local anaesthetic did not influence the effect of pH adjustment. Maternal and umbilical cord plasma levels of bupivacaine were not affected by pH adjustment of the local anaesthetic, while MV/UV and UA/UV ratios were unaltered.\r"

Human studies constituted 63 per cent of the total, with case reports and case series constituting over half. Study designs classes as descriptive in nature were remarkably rare in the anaesthesia literature, with prevalence and case-control studies constituting 0.8 and 3.3 per cent of the total respectively. Cohort studies (7.8 per cent), non-randomized intervention studies (12.8 per cent), and randomized controlled trials (17.8 per cent) were more numerous, but many suffered major contamination of experimental design. Frequently identified concerns in assessing the applicability of a given study to general anaesthetic practice were a bias induced by selection of the study subjects, application of the results from tertiary care hospitals to community hospitals, and contamination of the study protocol. These factors were identified as present in the majority of articles. The results suggest that growth of the specialty of anaesthesia is constrained by the narrow spectrum of study designs, as well as major problems affecting generalizability of the published results.\r"

During transport to the recovery room (a less than 30 second trip), the endotracheal tube in the spontaneously breathing infant became obstructed, possibly due to impaction of the tip in the right main bronchus. Restoration of the airway was followed by fulminant pulmonary oedema. Several days of vigorous respiratory and pharmacologic therapy were required for resolution of the infant's respiratory distress. We review other reported cases of acute airway obstruction associated with pulmonary oedema in children and briefly describe the proposed mechanisms. The difficulties of gauging proper endotracheal tube depth in the infant are noted. This case report demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring during patient transport to the recovery room.\r"

This iodinated fatty acid analogue, 15-(para-iodophenyl)-3-methyl pentadecanoic acid, was given intravenously at 3 hours of reperfusion following 15 minutes (Group 1, n = 5 dogs) or 60 minutes (Group 2, n = 5 dogs) of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured during occlusion and reperfusion with radiolabeled microspheres administered via the left atrium. Paired ultrasonic subendocardial crystals were placed in the ischemic perfusion bed to assess regional left ventricular systolic function at baseline, during ischemia and reperfusion. Electron microscopic analysis and staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was performed. Groups 1 and 2 dogs had similar (p = NS) myocardial blood flows during occlusion. TTC positive 1 g endocardial segments from Group 1 (n = 98) and Group 2 (n = 71) had 37% greater fatty acid analogue activity (0.26 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.09 percent injected dose per gram; p less than 0.05) compared with TTC negative segments from Group 2 dogs (n = 37). When fatty acid analogue activity was related to near simultaneous reperfusion blood flow, this ratio was 27% greater (p less than 0.05) in TTC positive segments (0.38 +/- 0.1) compared with TTC negative (0.30 +/- 0.16) segments, and 9% greater than normal (0.35 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.05). While ischemic regions from both Groups 1 and 2 dogs became similarly dyskinetic during occlusion (systolic shortening, -11 +/- 6 vs. -11 +/- 2%; p = NS), TTC negative segments remained akinetic (= 1 +/- 7%) at 3 hours of reperfusion while TTC positive zones had recovered partial systolic function (8 +/- 22%). Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of reversible ultrastructural changes in TTC positive regions. A 60-minute occlusion, 3-hour reperfusion model adapted for in vivo single photon emission computed tomography showed a similar excess of 123I fatty acid activity over flow when compared to perfusion (as measured with 201Tl) in the ischemic border zone of 4/4 canine myocardial infarcts. We conclude that the accumulation of this non-beta-oxidized fatty acid analogue noninvasively identifies zones of discordance between fatty acid and flow distribution that are characteristic of ischemically \"stunned\" but viable myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "Xenon, despite its lack of chemical reactivity, associates preferentially with red cells in blood. To characterize the effect of this and the nature of xenon-tissue interaction in the liver, multiple indicator dilution studies were performed in the anesthetized normal dog through portal vein injection and hepatic vein collection of anaerobic blood samples. Two experimental runs were carried out in each animal, one at the prevailing hematocrit and the other at reduced hematocrit after bleeding and replacement with dextran. For comparison, the injection mixtures contained labeled red blood cells (a vascular reference), sucrose (an interstitial space reference), and labeled water (which freely enters liver cells), as well as labeled xenon. At the higher hematocrit, the labeled xenon curves generally rose earlier, peaked higher, and decayed more quickly than the labeled water curve; at the lower hematocrit, the xenon curve was delayed and diminished in magnitude in relation to the labeled water curves. Analysis of the curve shapes indicated that xenon, like labeled sucrose and water, underwent delayed wave flow-limited distribution. With knowledge of the red cell plasma partition coefficient (2.89 ml/ml), it was possible to both account for the change in form of the xenon curves with hematocrit and to use the data to estimate the liver cell tissue plasma xenon partition coefficient. Values averaged 1.93 ml/ml liver space, or 1.79 ml/g, and did not change significantly from first to second runs. Theoretical analysis indicated that flow cannot be estimated from xenon downslopes.\r"

In a single-blind study versus placebo, it was shown that perindopril significantly reduced blood pressure (p less than 0.01), whereas there was an increase in brachial blood flow (p less than 0.01) because of a simultaneous increase in blood flow velocity (p less than 0.01) and arterial diameter (p less than 0.01). During a 5-minute period of wrist occlusion, blood flow velocity was reduced to a greater extent with perindopril than with placebo (p less than 0.001), whereas corresponding reductions in arterial diameter were equivalent, indicating that the increase in diameter after perindopril could not be explained simply on the basis of flow-dependent dilatation. During active treatment, brachial artery compliance increased (p less than 0.01) and pulse wave velocity decreased (p less than 0.01), whereas there was no change in the tangential tension of the arterial wall, defined as the product of mean arterial pressure and arterial diameter. Four weeks after treatment was stopped, blood pressure and forearm arterial hemodynamics returned toward baseline values. Cardiac mass was significantly decreased after perindopril (p less than 0.01) and remained decreased 4 weeks after cessation of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Comparison of the hemodynamic and hormonal effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with different ancillary properties may help to clarify the antihypertensive mechanism of these drugs. Under strict basal conditions, the effects of acebutolol (400 mg b.i.d.), atenolol (100 mg b.i.d.), pindolol (10 mg b.i.d.), and propranolol (80 mg t.i.d.), were studied for the first 24 hours in 40 hypertensive patients. With pindolol, mean arterial pressure was reduced (p less than 0.05) 1 hour after administration, whereas the cardiac index and the systemic vascular resistance index did not change. With the other three drugs, the fall in mean arterial pressure was delayed 2-3 hours. With these drugs, the fall in mean arterial pressure was preceded by a rise in the resistance index, which compensated for the initial fall in cardiac index. With each drug, the decrements in mean arterial pressure were associated with parallel decrements in the resistance index, and percent changes in mean arterial pressure and the resistance index were always significantly (p less than 0.001) correlated. At the end of the 24-hour period, the four drugs shared an equal antihypertensive effect, which varied 14-17%. This was associated with a return of the cardiac index toward control values by acebutolol, atenolol, and propranolol treatment and a moderately increased cardiac index above pretreatment values (13%, p less than 0.01) with pindolol. The secondary rise in the cardiac index was inversely correlated (p less than 0.001) with the fall in mean arterial pressure with all four drugs. Plasma renin was maximally suppressed 2 hours after treatment, thus before any change in mean arterial pressure had occurred with acebutolol, atenolol, and propranolol. Pretreatment values of active renin and the reduction of mean arterial pressure 24 hours after administration were not correlated in any of the four groups. Despite the \"vasodilator\" action of the four drugs, plasma norepinephrine did not rise. Our data show that the main hemodynamic change that occurs at the time blood pressure falls after beta-adrenoceptor antagonism is vasodilation. Neither autoregulation of blood flow nor renin suppression can explain this vasodilator action. The absence of an increase in norepinephrine, despite vasodilation, suggests that beta-adrenoceptor antagonism interferes with sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity. This effect may explain the vasodilator and antihypertensive potential of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.\r"

One child may have experienced this several times. The clinical features associated with a benign outcome in this syndrome include: pediatric age group, mild head trauma, brief or no LOC, onset of blindness occurring within hours of the head injury, absent optokinetic nystagmus, duration of blindness less than 24 hours, agitation and restlessness, absence of skull fracture or visible cerebral injury on CT scan, absence of other neurological deficits, and EEG findings that initially show posterior slowing with subsequent normalization. Transiently fixed and dilated pupils have been described in these patients but should be viewed cautiously by clinicians in making this diagnosis, since cortical blindness is defined by sparing of the pupils. This syndrome may be underdiagnosed, since it may not be obvious that the child is blind unless the diagnosis is considered.\r"

In nine twin pairs PRA was higher in the smoker both at rest and during exercise. The mean PRA was 99% higher at rest and 84% higher during exercise than in nonsmokers. Plasma aldosterone levels were higher at rest in seven smokers and during exercise in eight smokers compared with the respective nonsmokers. The mean aldosterone level at rest was 23% and during exercise 40% higher in the smokers than in the nonsmokers. Chronic smoking induces increased PRA, which results in increased aldosterone formation, presumably via enhanced generation of angiotensin II. This may partly explain the greater vasoconstrictive reactivity typical of the arteries of chronic smokers.\r"

It is a most fascinating history for it mirrored that of the history of medicine itself. The recognition of the importance of urine in diagnosis was made over 6000 years ago by several of the earliest civilizations, and a few of their clay tablets have been found that give us some insight into their observations and conclusions. However, the progress in analysis and its clinical significance was often slow and frequently littered with charlatanism. Visual inspection alone, and prognostication therefrom, was shown to be inadequate as a single means of diagnosis, and over 600 years ago Paracelsus, as well as others, began to reject ancient dogma and searched for new approaches to the analysis of urine by using chemical distillation techniques. Progress in anatomy and physiology, coupled with the understanding of organ function, provided a fertile field for the investigation of the composition of the urine and associating its chemical constituents with specific disease states. The advent of the microscope caused scientists to examine all body fluids, especially the urine, and to record their observations as an aid to diagnosis--the beginnings of medical microscopy. This century has also seen remarkable advances in the field of urinalysis: dipstick testing, the application of modern chemical and microscopic techniques to constituent analysis, automation, and, most recently, monoclonal antibody and recombinant gene technology to enhance and improve urine examination. In short, urinalysis, the first of all laboratory tests, began as and still remains a most valuable and highly important means of diagnosis in clinical medicine.\r"

The monoclonal antibody technique allowed for the identification of granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, glomerular epithelial, proximal tubular, loop of Henle, distal tubule/collecting duct, and urothelial cells in urine, and by quantifying these cells it was possible to determine the urine cell profiles in various renal diseases as well as in allograft rejection and early post-transplant acute tubular necrosis in renal allograft recipients. The cell profiles are useful in aiding the diagnosis of these conditions.\r"

Because of this, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of assays to satisfy these needs. Three approaches include measurement in the urine of low-molecular-weight plasma proteins such as beta 2-microglobulin; a variety of kidney-derived enzymes, such as L-alanine aminopeptidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase; and specific renal antigens using immunologic detection. The first two of these have not proved to be adequately sensitive or specific, complicated by the frequent loss of activity associated with the physicochemical characteristics of the urine or the presence of pyuria. Despite this, useful information has been obtained. In particular, assays of beta 2-microglobulin urinary excretion and retinol binding protein appear to have clinical utility that should be pursued. Recent experience with a monoclonal antibody-based assay for a unique proximal tubular antigen, the adenosine deaminase binding protein, suggests that a battery of such assays, each directed against an antigen localized to a particular segment of the nephron, may be particularly useful.\r"

It allows for improved detection of the eosinophiluria when compared with conventional Wright's stain. The mechanism underlying the superiority of the Hansel's stain remains to be elucidated. Eosinophiluria demonstrated by Hansel's stain appears to be a sensitive marker for drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis and probably allows differentiation from acute tubular necrosis. However, the spectrum of eosinophiluria also includes acute glomerulonephritis, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, prostatitis, and urinary tract obstruction. Therefore, the finding of eosinophiluria on Hansel's stain clearly cannot be considered diagnostic of acute interstitial nephritis. In the absence of renal biopsy or other clinical clues to suggest the diagnosis, eosinophiluria should not be used as the sole criterion for the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis or a a justification for empiric steroid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary tract infection is the commonest human bacterial infection. Bacteriuria alone does not appear to produce progressive renal damage or hypertension. However, it can produce considerable morbidity. Urinalysis is a simple, relatively sensitive, and reliable way of diagnosing urinary tract infection. It is not clear that routine screening should be performed in all patients, but pregnant females, patients with known anatomic abnormalities, and patients with recent genitourinary instrumentation should be screened. The major determinant of therapeutic success in patients with urinary tract infections is the anatomic site of infection. Superficial mucosal infection of the bladder is well treated with a single dose of an appropriate antibiotic, whereas deep tissue infection of the kidney or prostate should be treated with a prolonged and intensive course of therapy. Urinalysis is an insensitive tool in the localization of infection. However, the presence of white cell casts on the examination of the urinary sediment is pathognomonic of upper tract infection and would lead one to pursue an aggressive course of therapy. Examination of the concentrating ability is of limited help in this regard because of the wide range of overlap of concentrating ability in patients with upper and lower tract infections. In selected instances, urinalysis is of help in guiding therapy of urinary tract infections. This is particularly true of the patients with acute urethral syndrome where therapy is guided by the presence or absence of pyuria. Urinalysis, a simple front-line test, is of paramount importance in the evaluation and management of the patient with urinary tract infection.\r"

The development of diabetic nephropathy is preceded for many years by minor increases in urine albumin excretion (microalbuminuria), and some diabetologists believe that by reducing or reversing this early abnormality, possibly by more rigorous control of hyperglycemia or by correcting glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities, the later development of frank nephropathy might be delayed or prevented. Once frank nephropathy has developed, its progress to renal failure is little, if at all, influenced by therapy. The early detection of microalbuminuria is therefore important for the management of diabetic patients, and its measurement should be available to all diabetologists. Sensitive, precise, and accurate methods are readily available to most laboratories. The preferred specimen is a 24-hour collection of urine or a timed overnight collection. A quantitation corrected for creatinine on a first-morning specimen may be a sufficiently sensitive test to detect those patients who should be subjected to a more extensive collection. Whether random samples taken at other times of the day are also suitable for screening remains to be proved.\r"

Drug efficacy should be evaluated by a 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording and by a treadmill exercise stress test. Blood drug levels should be measured at appropriate times. Maintenance doses of the various antiarrhythmic drugs are listed. Electrophysiologic testing with induction of ventricular tachycardia by extrastimulation may predict the clinical efficacy of the antiarrhythmic drug or combination of drugs needed for the long-term treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Electrophysiologic testing must be used for selecting antiarrhythmic drugs in patients who have experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation but who are free of VPCs during ambulatory ECG monitoring and exercise stress testing. If patients have life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs, surgical intervention is indicated. Complex VPCs in asymptomatic patients without heart disease should not be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

Death rates rose steeply with age among the elderly. Men had higher death rates than women, but the male-to-female ratio declined with increasing age. Considerable geographic variation in CHD mortality in the elderly was noted. Since 1968, CHD death rates have declined in persons greater than or equal to 65 years of age in each age, sex, and race group. However, prevalence of self-reported CHD in the elderly population has increased. Prevalence rates increased with age except for a slight decrease above age 75 in men. In 1985, 436,000 persons aged greater than or equal to 65 years were discharged with a principal diagnosis of acute MI. The hospital case fatality rate was 21.8%. Since 1970, hospitalization rates for acute MI have generally increased, while hospital fatality rates have decreased for persons greater than or equal to 65 years of age. Since 1979, utilization of coronary artery bypass surgery and coronary arteriography have dramatically increased among the elderly. In 1980 and 1981, elderly persons made six million visits to physicians' offices for chronic CHD. CHD contributed importantly to the 1980 expenditures of 3.3 billion dollars in men and 4.8 billion dollars in women greater than or equal to 65 years of age for heart disease care. Although mortality rates from CHD in the elderly have decreased since 1968, increasing hospitalization rates and utilization of other health care services emphasize the need for more vigorous efforts at prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In response, many conferences, editorials, and planning activities for medical and premedical curricula have been devoted to the subject of restoring the elements of compassion and personal involvement to the relationship between physician and patient. Nonetheless, the change in the doctor-patient relationship might merely reflect the growing indifference to people as individuals that seems to pervade our society in all service-related areas. Although the loss is particularly objectionable for the sick, some may claim it is compensated by scientifically superior care in present-day medical practice. This paper will reflect briefly on past and present views of medical care and its evaluation. It will conclude that a scientifically sound evaluation of treatment might also offer a solution for restoration of human elements in the delivery of medical care.\r"

It is likely that some patients who require prolonged life support will need replacement organs or, should their brains fail to survive resuscitation, become organ donors.

With it followed an abundance of legal controversies and ethical dilemmas. Optimal use of viable organs necessitated precise definition of brain death in heart-beating cadavers with artificially maintained ventilation and circulation. Viable organs must remain well perfused to be suitable for procurement and transplantation into carefully selected recipients on an equal-opportunity basis. Due consideration must be given to both medical and social indications. At present, homografts dominate the field of organ transplantation; however, because of the shortage of human organs, both artificial organs (especially hearts) and xenografts are expected to become increasingly common in the near future. No doubt, the use of such modern technology will introduce additional ethical problems.\r"

This system was initiated by research that started in the 1950s. Present community-wide results are encouraging, but suboptimal. Maximal benefit from CPCR will be achievable: a) by minimizing response times; and b) by extending reversible arrest times--the topic of this symposium. For reperfusion, closed chest CPR is more readily available than, but physiologically inferior to, open chest CPR and emergency cardiopulmonary bypass. To optimize outcome, four components of the postresuscitation syndrome are being investigated: a) perfusion failure; b) reoxygenation injury cascades; c) self-intoxication; and d) blood derangements. Results from animal outcome studies so far suggest significant but still inconsistent benefit from several special postarrest treatments. The longest normothermic no-flow time yet reversed to good functional survival of heart, brain and the entire organism appears to be not 5 min, but between 10 and 20 min. The following is recommended and in part has been initiated: a) simultaneous investigation of pathophysiologic limits, therapeutic potentials, and prognosticating measurements; b) simultaneous basic research at cellular, organ, and organism levels; c) increased communication and consensus on research models between research centers; d) use of short-term and long-term animal models for systematic mechanism-oriented and empirical outcome-oriented studies; e) development of etiology-specific combination treatments; and f) community-wide case registries combined with epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical treatment trials.\r"

Primary effects of oxygen radicals result in lipid peroxidation, which is believed to be initiated by a perferryl radical. Secondary effects are believed to be due to a disturbance in cellular calcium homeostasis. Reactions and treatment potentials are highly complex and their effects on cells, tissues, and organism are difficult to predict. Treatment potentials include superoxide dismutase, catalase, calcium entry blockers, iron chelators, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and agents to prevent leukocyte adhesion. Reoxygenation injury mechanisms during resuscitation from clinical death can be studied in animals by evaluating the effects of antireoxygenation injury therapies and by monitoring free radical reactions.\r"

It is suggested that selective neuronal vulnerability, observed after brief periods of ischemia and after hypoglycemic coma, qualifies as an excitotoxic lesion, which causes postsynaptic damage to neurons innervated by excitatory amino acids by enhancing calcium influx. However, ischemic damage often involves glial and vascular cells as well, and causes infarction. It is hypothesized that this type of brain damage is related to acidosis and that enhanced acidosis is detrimental because it accelerates delocalization of protein-bound iron, with an ensuing free-radical damage to membrane lipids and proteins.\r"

Children can withstand brain ischemic insults that are usually lethal to older patients. Other modifying factors of ischemia, such as barbiturates and serum glucose, remain poorly defined in humans. Once a cerebral ischemic event occurs, for example, after cardiac arrest and resuscitation, secondary events (such as alterations in the perfusability and reactivity of the microcirculation) may aggravate the original ischemic injury at discrete sites of the brain. A more exact definition of a) the limits of reversibility of ischemic injury, b) the histologic features of sublethally injured tissues, and c) the effects of various therapeutic interventions, awaits the development of relatively inexpensive and reproducible animal models of ischemia in which objective comparisons can be made between the nature of the local circulatory conditions and the accompanying histologic abnormalities.\r"

These processes continue until the myocardium dies. The products of anaerobic metabolism, chiefly glycolytic intermediates, inorganic phosphate, H+, and creatine, are produced intracellularly and accumulate in the tissue. Because the demand for high-energy phosphates (HEP) in the tissue exceeds the supply available from anaerobic glycolysis and HEP reserves, net ATP level declines, approaching zero after 100 min of ischemia at 37 degrees C. At this time, the changes in totally ischemic tissue in vitro are equivalent to those seen in myocytes irreversibly injured by severe ischemia in vivo. During reoxygenation after total ischemia, the resumption of effective contractile activity depends partly on the metabolic changes and degree of myocyte injury sustained during ischemia.\r"

Stepwise increase in PEEP resulted in both a) a progressive increase in PaO2 and transcutaneous oxyhemoglobin saturation, and b) a depression of pulsed Doppler-measured cardiac output that was statistically significant at 9 cm H2O PEEP. Thus, averaged systemic oxygen delivery (DO2) was maintained with improved arterial oxygenation up to 6 cm H2O PEEP. Further increase in PEEP induced a significant fall in DO2. No variation was observed in heart rate and mean arterial pressure. The combined use of oximetry and pulsed Doppler echocardiography enables noninvasive optimization of mechanical ventilation and PEEP during the clinical course.\r"

The resulting PRISM score consists of 14 routinely measured, physiologic variables, and 23 variable ranges. The performance of a logistic function estimating PICU mortality risk from the PRISM score, age, and operative status was tested in a different sample from six PICUs (1,227 patients, 105 deaths), each PICU separately, and in diagnostic groups using chi-square goodness-of-fit tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. In all groups, the number and distribution of survivors and nonsurvivors in adjacent mortality risk intervals were accurately predicted: total validation group (chi 2(5) = 0.80; p greater than .95), each PICU separately (chi 2(5) range 0.83 to 7.38; all p greater than .10), operative patients (chi 2(5) = 2.03; p greater than .75), nonoperative patients (chi 2(5) = 2.80, p greater than .50), cardiovascular disease patients (chi 2(5) = 4.72; p greater than .25), respiratory disease patients (chi 2(5) = 5.82; p greater than .25), and neurologic disease patients (chi 2(5) = 7.15; p greater than .10).

  ".W": "The dose response of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, was evaluated in order to determine the most efficacious dose in the treatment of canine endotoxin shock. Fifteen minutes after an infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin, four groups of dogs were given a single iv dose of 1, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen. These groups were compared to endotoxin only and saline control groups. All ibuprofen doses significantly improved the systolic, diastolic, and mean systemic arterial BP. The improvement in systemic BP was accompanied by an increase in the systemic vascular resistance. Pulmonary vascular pressures and resistance also increased after ibuprofen administration. The lack of a dose response and the demonstrated beneficial effect of low dose ibuprofen in the reversal of the hypotension associated with experimental canine endotoxin shock lead us to recommend the use of low dose ibuprofen for future endotoxin and sepsis studies. Use of low dose ibuprofen might have less of an effect on renal perfusion and would therefore be more likely to produce the beneficial hemodynamic response without compromising renal function.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind randomized trial, 40 patients with acute severe asthma were given either nebulized salbutamol, 5 mg, or salbutamol, 5 mg mixed with ipratropium bromide 500 micrograms, on admission to hospital and again two hours later. There was no significant difference between the mean peak flows of the two treatment groups at any time. However, two hours after each treatment, there were fewer subjects in the ipratropium and salbutamol group whose peak flow rates had fallen back toward baseline levels than in the salbutamol only treatment group. Thus, although ipratropium did not improve the overall maximal bronchodilator response, it may have prolonged the duration of the response, which would be a clinically useful effect.\r"
