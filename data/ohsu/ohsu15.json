The opacified posterior capsule was punctiformly opened and the retrolenticular space widened with sodium hyaluronate, too. The isolated posterior capsule could be excised with microscissors without damaging the corneal endothelium or the anterior vitreous face. Integrity of the vitreous was preserved in 94% of the operated eyes. The described technique can be regarded as the method of choice for management of solid capsular opacities in infants and may be also helpful in some cases of membranous capsular changes in adults.\r"

The haptics of intraocular lenses may erode into the pars plicata, and we were therefore prompted to study the effects of ultrasound energy on intraocular lenses. The energy is highly absorbed by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), resulting in partial melting, vacuolization, and opacification of this material at intensities much lower than those used in the glaucoma treatment. Polypropylene absorbed much less of the energy, resulting in relatively minor morphologic changes with this material. We recommend caution in using this device in eyes with anterior chamber intraocular lenses and eyes with posterior chamber intraocular lenses having PMMA haptics.\r"

A group of non-angulated, non-ridged lenses placed out of the capsular bag had an adequate space in 82% of cases, and a group of non-angulated, non-ridged lenses placed in the capsular bag had only 44% adequate spaces.

Following injury, a precise anatomic reduction of the tarsometatarsal joint is critical if long-term disability is to be avoided. There appears to be a direct correlation between achieving an accurate reduction and a satisfactory clinical result. In our experience, surgical reduction offers the most effective and reliable means of achieving this goal. We have presented an approach for the management of these lesions, which we believe offers advantages over previously described techniques. Our experience has shown that accurate anatomic operative reduction and rigid internal fixation provide an increased assurance of a pain-free, durable, and functional foot in the great majority of cases.\r"

This must be completed within a 6 to 8-hour period after injury for optimal results. Peroneal nerve injuries are common, and permanent neurologic damage may result. The neurovascular injury should be well documented both at the time of injury and in the preinjury state. After all problems affecting limb survival are solved, open repair of all ligamentous injuries is recommended to provide ligamentous stability and congruity of the joint. Prior to performing the procedure, a surgeon must have a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the knee. Rehabilitation techniques and early postoperative motion are important for guiding the injured patient through the immediate and late postoperative period.\r"

The lasting effects, however, of attempts at aggressive fixation of the pelvic fracture will be the principles of management that are being established. This begins with the recognition of pelvic instability. It is in these unstable injuries that obtaining and maintaining an anatomic reduction is the best way to alter the natural history of the untreated pelvic fracture and to maximize the probability of obtaining a good long-term result. While the actual methods of internal and external fixation will continue to change, this principle is unlikely to alter. Therefore, if effective treatment can be achieved by closed means alone, that is an acceptable method. Similarly, external, internal, and combined operative and traction treatment methods that achieve this goal would also be acceptable. The question remains: Which method achieves the goal of obtaining and maintaining an anatomic reduction yet minimizes the early and late morbidity? This question is best answered by appropriate preoperative evaluation, subsequent planning, and precise, technically skillful surgery done by an experienced surgeon.\r"

It should be remembered, however, that this surgery is among the most demanding in orthopedics. Extensive study of general principles and techniques is necessary, and individual case preparation must be exhaustive. Early experience is probably best restricted to elemental fracture patterns.

Management of the femoral shaft should not interfere with these goals because of the risk of post-traumatic necrosis of the femoral head.

Fracture of the plafond occurs when the talus is driven into the tibia from axial compression. The type of fracture that occurs will depend on the position and rotation of the foot at the time of impact. Historically, these fractures have been treated in a number of manners, but the best results have occurred when stable internal fixation is accomplished using plates and screws. Basic steps in reconstruction are restoration of anatomic length of the fibula with plate fixation, reconstruction of the tibial articular surface, cancellous bone grafting of the metaphyseal defect, and buttress plating either anteriorly or medially of the distal tibia. If anatomic reconstruction of the joint surface can be restored and stable fixation achieved, early motion of the ankle is made possible. This early motion reduces stiffness of the ankle and will yield the most satisfying results.\r"

The 147 cases of malignant salivary gland tumors were reviewed according to presenting characteristics and stage, histology, and outcome. Treatment for each type is summarized. The battery of diagnostic aids and prognostic indicators available to the physician are also reviewed. The newer and more controversial procedures of CT scanning, nuclear magnetic resonance scanning, and fine-needle aspiration are discussed in detail. In the past, salivary gland tumors have been classified by histology alone. Current trends employ the TNM staging system in planning treatment and predicting end results. We have found a far better survival rate in patients with various tumor types presenting with stage I or II disease, but point out that patients with high-grade tumors often present with advanced disease. All major salivary gland tumors should be approached according to the principles of cancer surgery. The minimum procedure is thus superficial or total parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. In low-grade malignancies, the diagnostic procedure will have accomplished this definitive treatment. Salivary gland tumors are rare in the pediatric population. Such malignancies often defy radical treatment. Although cure rates in many categories of high-grade tumors are low, the only hope for survival is an initial aggressive surgical approach. Although radiation was used for recurrent disease only during the years of this study, it is currently being used as adjuvant therapy in almost all malignancies except low-grade mucoepidermoid. Recurrences are almost always fatal.\r"

  ".W": "The type A behavior pattern is characterized by excessive competitive drive, a sense of time urgency, enhanced aggressiveness, hostility and a persistent desire for recognition. Type A behaviour is widely recognized as a risk factor in coronary heart disease. This study investigated whether type As and Bs differ in their experience of pain and pain coping efforts. A group of type A (n = 35) and a group of type B (n = 19) cardiac disease patients served as subjects. All subjects underwent diagnostic treadmill testing and were compared on a variety of pain measures. There were no differences between type As and Bs in age, sex, presence of state or trait anxiety or severity of cardiac disease. Type A patients, however, were much more likely than type Bs to be classified on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional angina scale as having more severe pain and functional limitation. Type As were also less likely to use pain coping strategies to deal with their pain. Those who assess pain and functional impairment in cardiac patients using the NYHA scale should be aware that type A personality characteristics may affect their assessments. Type A patients who tend to make little use of pain coping strategies may benefit from systematic training in pain control methods. Additional research is needed to examine whether type A-B differences in pain and pain coping strategies may affect risks of coronary morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the likely involvement of central convergence of afferent inputs in mechanisms underlying referred pain, the activity of single neurones was recorded in the cat's trigeminal (V) subnucleus caudalis (medullary dorsal horn) to test for the presence and extent of convergent inputs to the neurones. In chloralose-anaesthetized or decerebrate unanaesthetized cats, electrical stimuli were applied to afferents supplying facial skin, oral mucosa, canine and premolar tooth pulp, laryngeal mucosa, cervical skin and muscle, and jaw and tongue muscles, and tactile and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli were applied to skin and mucosa. Considerable proportions of caudalis neurones which could be functionally classified on the basis of their cutaneous receptive field properties as low-threshold mechanoreceptive (LTM), wide-dynamic-range (WDR), or nociceptive-specific (NS) neurones, could be excited by electrical stimulation of several of these afferent inputs. Extensive convergence of afferent inputs, including inputs from skin or mucosal areas outside the neuronal oral-facial receptive field delineated by natural stimuli, was a particular feature of the units classified as cutaneous nociceptive neurones (i.e., WDR and NS). On the basis of antidromic activation, 15% of these WDR and NS neurones were shown to have a direct projection to the contralateral thalamus. The findings question the use of terminology and classifications of somatosensory neurones based only on the cutaneous receptive field properties of the neurones since distinctions between the different neuronal populations become less obvious when properties other than those related to cutaneous afferent inputs are taken into account. Moreover, the observations of extensive convergence of different types of afferents, which was especially apparent in cutaneous nociceptive neurones, also suggest a role for these neurones in mediating deep pain and in spread and referral of pain.\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine the sensitivity of the nociceptive system of birds to capsaicin, the algesic potency of the drug was compared with that of veratridine and mustard oil by instillation into the eye of conscious pigeons and guinea-pigs. In guinea-pigs, 10(-6) g/ml capsaicin provoked severe protective reactions, but even high concentrations of 10(-2) g/ml were insufficient in pigeons. Veratridine and mustard oil induced similar reactions in both species. Close arterial injections of algesic substances revealed that the threshold dose of capsaicin for cardiovascular and nocifensive reactions was 10,000-fold higher in pigeons (200 micrograms) than in guinea-pigs (0.02 micrograms). All other algesic substances tested (bradykinin, 5-HT, veratridine and KCl) had similar thresholds in both species. Slow infusion of a total dose of 600 mg/kg capsaicin into the radial artery of pigeons did not alter the sensitivity to any of the algesic substances tested, which demonstrates that even high concentrations of capsaicin have no desensitizing effect. The demonstrated insensitivity of pigeons to the algesic effect of capsaicin is discussed in the context of the inability of the drug to deplete substance P (SP) from afferent terminals in the spinal cord of the pigeon.\r"

The addition of monetary reinforcement of quota achievement did not enhance performance, while the addition of a placebo decreased the effectiveness of quota setting. Self-efficacy expectancies were significantly correlated with pain tolerance times and were better predictors of tolerance than pain ratings. Self-efficacy expectancies and pain tolerance times at treatment were both found to predict 1 week follow-up performance.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the proven safety value of wearing vehicle safety restraints, people continue to travel without this protection. Legislation requiring the use of safety restraints has been implemented in several countries, including Australia, in an attempt to improve rates of restraint use. In Australia, legislation dramatically increased rates of adult restraint use, yet the rate of restraint use by children remains comparatively low. One of the main reasons for parents not restraining their child is the child's dislike of wearing a restraint, with resultant disruptive behavior. This study compared two interventions implemented within preschools: a coercive intervention aimed at parents and an educational intervention aimed at preschool children. Measures of restraint use were made by direct observation at preschools prior to intervention and again immediately following the 2-week interventions. The safety restraint use of children in the control and coercive intervention groups did not change significantly as a result of intervention. Restraint use of children in the educational intervention group increased 15 percentage points from 60.6% to 75.0%: a significant increase of 25%. This novel intervention approach holds promise as a means of increasing preschool children's use of safety restraints.\r"

Depression among mothers occurs frequently, is persistent, and is related to other factors such as low social class and marital disharmony. Studies demonstrate an association between a mother's depression and adverse outcomes for her child including low birth weight, behavior problems, somatic complaints, poor growth, accidents, and affective illness. Affect and child-rearing characteristics of depressed mothers seem to be important factors in mediating these poor outcomes. Pediatricians have a special role in helping depressed mothers and their children.\r"

In this study the specific health care needs of 80 Indochinese refugee teenagers, evaluated during a 4-year period, were determined. The Centers for Disease Control's suggested screening measures were used, and it was found that 52% had positive purified protein derivative skin tests, 38% lacked immunizations, 35% had stool specimens positive for parasites (prevalence and number of parasites greatest among Cambodians), 14% had blood tests positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, and 10% were anemic. Additional evaluations showed that 19% had hemoglobinopathies, 14% were in or below the fifth percentile for height and weight, 12% had goiters, 12% had skin disorders, 8% had positive hepatitis B surface antigen, 5% had visual defects, 5% had hearing loss, 5% had psychosomatic illness, and 4% had idiopathic scoliosis. Although suggested Centers for Disease Control screening measures may be adequate for younger Indochinese children, these data suggest that additional studies are necessary for teenagers. For the sexually active adolescent, identification of and counseling for hepatitis antigenemia and hemoglobinopathies are crucial. In addition, early identification of emotional and physical problems during screening may enhance assimilation into a new society and facilitate completion of the psychosocial tasks of adolescence.\r"

These included both symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings. The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux in asymptomatic siblings, however, has not been studied extensively. Sixty asymptomatic siblings of patients known to have vesicoureteral reflux were studied with radionuclide voiding cystography. Their ages ranged from 2 months to 15 years (mean, 4.2 years). Vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 27 of 60 (45%) of the siblings. Vesicoureteral reflux was unilateral in 15 and bilateral in 12 of the siblings. Radionuclide cystography is more sensitive than radiographic cystography and results in a very low radiation dose to the patient. The gonadal dose with radionuclide cystography is only 1.0 to 2.0 mrads. Because of these features, radionuclide cystography is a nearly ideal technique for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in siblings of patients with known vesicoureteral reflux. All siblings (symptomatic or asymptomatic) of patients with known vesicoureteral reflux should have a screening radionuclide cystography.\r"

The survey included 1,625 infants with birth weights of 700 to 1,500 g. We confirmed the relationship of risk to low birth weight, white race, and male sex. Significant differences in the incidence of chronic lung disease were found between institutions even when birth weight, race, and sex were taken into consideration through a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Columbia had one of the best outcomes for low birth weight infants and the lowest incidence of chronic lung disease.\r"

There are significant differences between these two warming techniques, and no definitive data exist to aid the clinical specialist in governing radiant warmer control. Eighteen low birth weight premature infants less than 2 weeks of age were studied under powerful overhead radiant warmers to determine the optimal skin temperature for servocontrol of radiant heater output. Anterior abdominal wall temperature was servocontrolled at 35.5 degrees, 36.5 degrees, and 37.5 degrees C in a randomized fashion for three periods of 90 minutes each after thermal equilibrium was established. Oxygen consumption was measured during the entire 90-min sample period at each temperature by a computerized metabolic apparatus to determine the optimal thermal neutral control temperature defined as minimal oxygen consumption with normal body temperature. Skin, deep rectal, and environmental temperature measurements, as well as behavior assessments, were made concurrently. Oxygen consumption was significantly elevated at 35.5 degrees C (8.62 +/- 0.73 mL/kg/min, mean +/- SEM) compared with 36.5 degrees C (7.30 +/- 0.55 mL/kg/min). Changing servocontrol temperature to 37.5 degrees C produced no further significant decrease in oxygen consumption (7.41 +/- 0.70 mL/kg/min), and nine infants manifested supranormal deep rectal temperatures (greater than 37.5 degrees C). Optimal abdominal skin temperature control at 36.5 degrees C (slightly warmer than previously reported but less than 37.5 degrees C) is recommended for premature neonates nursed on radiant warmer beds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mothers from 449 households containing 575 children less than 5 years of age were selected by random-digit dialing and questioned about upper respiratory tract infection and ear infection occurring in their children during the preceding 2 weeks. Household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, maternal smoking history and child day-care attendance and breast-feeding information were also obtained. For children less than 5 years of age, the reported incidence of upper respiratory tract infection was 24%, and of ear infection, 6%. Controlling for the other variables measured, day-care attendance was associated with a significantly increased risk of both illnesses. For upper respiratory tract infection, increased risk was present for all children attending day care (P = .02, odds ratio = 1.6), whereas for ear infection, risk could be demonstrated only for full-time attendees (P = .005, odds ratio = 3.8). Maternal smoking was a second independent risk factor for a child's having upper respiratory tract infection (odds ratio = 1.7, P = .01). Thirty-one percent of all upper respiratory tract infection among day-care attendees and 66% of all ear infections among full-time day-care attendees were attributable to day-care attendance. Given the proportion of children in day care, 9% to 14% of the total burden of upper respiratory tract disease in this population was day care related.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Overall, 3,009 injuries were reported (2.82/100 students per year). Elementary school students had only a slightly higher rate (2.85) than secondary school students (2.78). However, the cause, nature, school location of injury, and body area injured formed distinct patterns in these two groups. Playgrounds were responsible for the highest overall and elementary school rates, whereas sports areas and classrooms had the highest rates among secondary school students. Falls were the most frequent cause of injury in elementary schools whereas, as expected, sports injuries were the most frequent cause among secondary school students. Contusions and abrasions of the head were the most frequent type of injury for both groups, although more common among elementary school students, whereas fractures, sprains, strains, and dislocations were more frequent among secondary school students. Although the proportion of severe injuries to secondary school students was slightly higher (39 v 35%), the rate of referral of students to a hospital or physicians among secondary school students (1.21 per 100 student-hours) was almost twice the rate of elementary school students (0.65 per 100 student-hours). Problems with definition of injury severity and the need to explore the social aspects of schools as a factor in injuries emerged as important considerations for future research.\r"

Cases illustrating the following concepts are presented. Intravenous verapamil therapy in babies may cause apnea, hypotension, and bradycardia; continued episodes of atrial flutter in a child may cause sudden death; quinidine may be related to the death; children with \"familial seizure disorders\" may in fact have the long QT interval syndrome. The QT interval must be measured on the ECG in patients with unexplained seizures; \"supraventricular tachycardia with aberration\" is uncommon in children. Rapid heart rates with QRS complexes that are different from the sinus complexes are likely to be ventricular tachycardia. These situations must be recognized as potential problems and must be treated appropriately.\r"

The research is based on identically drawn stratified random samples of children from the elementary school special education populations of five large metropolitan school systems. It was found that health insurance coverage was a predictor of whether a disabled child had seen a doctor in the past year even after adjustment for site, family background characteristics, type and severity of childhood disability, and structural access factors (adjusted odds ratio, 1.76, P less than .05); Hispanic children with disabilities were more likely than white children to be without any health insurance (adjusted odds ratio, 3.63; P less than .001), but there was no similar statistically significant difference between blacks and whites; and wide variations persist in scope of insurance payment for care, such that parents of publicly insured children paid out of pocket for only 5% of all physician visits as compared to 30% of visits for the privately insured. Even for children with various low-prevalence disabilities, when privately insured, parents paid out of pocket for 23% of all physician visits. These data help clarify the extent of health insurance coverage among children with disabilities and indicate that insurance remains an important predictor of physician use even though it continues to pay for only certain elements of care.\r"

The incidence of pulmonary vascular lipid deposits was greater in the group that received intravenous fat emulsion (P less than .02). Both the amount (grams per kilogram per day) and duration (days) of intravenous fat emulsion infusion were correlated positively with severity (P less than .05) in infants who had pulmonary vascular lipid deposits. No relationship was seen between peak serum triglyceride levels, the frequency of elevated triglycerides, and pulmonary vascular lipid deposits.

Of the three who died, none was rapidly warmed, and two of them had severe underlying central nervous system infection. Hypothermia of infancy and the associated disturbances are treatable today, on condition that modern medical facilities are available. It appears that the warming method has been overly stressed.\r"

We found that abnormalities in arterial blood gases were correlated with closed head injury, intubation in the field, and sex of the patient, while abnormalities on chest x-ray correlated with closed head trauma and intubation in the field. Abnormalities in clotting studies correlated only with intubation in the field. Obtaining a chest x-ray on a pediatric trauma victim with an Injury Severity Score of less than 10 will yield little information. The utility of routine laboratory tests in pediatric trauma victims may vary significantly from that of laboratory tests in adult trauma victims.\r"

In this study the 35 PL-1, P1-2, and PL-3 pediatric house staff of a university-affiliated hospital were surveyed by written questionnaire regarding their practices in dealing with children of less than two years with rectal temperature above 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C). Uniform replies were received from all house staff concerning the significance of patient age, degree of fever, and laboratory data, although there were some differences of opinion regarding the importance of specific data. All three resident levels tended to reduce the number of laboratory tests obtained as patient age increased, with emphasis placed on clinical impression of illness in assessing the older febrile child. Although the house staff indicated that they were satisfied with their handling of the febrile child, the PL-3s were only marginally more satisfied than the PL-1s and PL-2s. In general, the house staff had most confidence in handling the patient under three months of age, for whom it was generally felt that extensive laboratory evaluations and active management were indicated. The perception of the need for a formal protocol was also greatest for this youngest age group and decreased in importance with age.\r"

Those practices that attempt to provide care in a continuous way often encounter difficulty in attempting to change their patients' patterns of emergency department utilization. This study attempts to define the relationship between patient characteristics such as access to a telephone and inappropriate utilization of the emergency department. A university hospital database was reviewed to identify all patients of the pediatric group practice. Emergency department records over a six-month period were reviewed to identify all visits of group practice patients to the emergency department. Patients without access to a telephone were more likely to inappropriately access care in the emergency department than were patients with phone access. However, within the cohort of emergency department utilizers, phone access was not a predictor of use. Of those who used the emergency department, babies and young children and those of indigent status were more likely to inappropriately access care than were older children and those at a higher socioeconomic level. We conclude that the demographic information of clients in a pediatric group practice can be utilized to predict inappropriate utilization of emergency department services and that this information can be used to implement programs to help foster continuity of care.\r"

  ".W": "Venous access in children can be difficult and, in rare cases, impossible to achieve in a timely fashion. The three methods normally utilized to gain access, peripheral and central venipuncture and venous cutdowns, all require different skill levels for use. However, venous cutdowns, the last resort in intravenous line placement, have no performance standards by which to gauge competence. Therefore, a survey was conducted of the members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association to assess the frequency with which the pediatric cutdown is performed, the amount of time needed for the procedure, and the usual anatomic location where it is performed. Three age groups were included: neonate, one month to five years, and six to 16 years. The performance of five physician groups was also surveyed: pediatric surgeon, pediatric resident, pediatrician, surgical resident, and general surgeon. Results showed that, on the average, 56 cutdowns are done per pediatric surgeon per year. They reported that it took them an average of 11 minutes (range, one to 90 minutes) to complete the procedure in the neonate, eight minutes (range, one to 60 minutes) in the one month to five year group, and six minutes (range, one to 30 minutes) for the six to 16 year olds. The cutdown was found to be rarely used by other physician groups. The time required to complete the procedure, even by experts, makes its use as a first choice in an emergency unrealistic for most clinicians. Utilization of the pediatric venous cutdown, in emergency situations, should be done only by those clinicians familiar with the technique, and only while other methods for venous access are being simultaneously attempted.\r"

Notably absent were the behavioral aberrations such as aggression, which are usually seen with PCP intoxication in older children and adults. The possibility of drug intoxication was denied by most of the parents or surrogate parents accompanying these small children and infants for treatment. It is suggested that a systematic investigation for possible PCP exposure, including a urine toxicology screen for PCP (preferably by immunoassay methods), be conducted whenever an infant or child is brought for emergency treatment of unresponsiveness, bizarre behavior, dyskinesis, dystonic posturing, atypical oculomotor and pupil findings, or evidence of hallucinations.\r"

Torque was measured during an initial and 40 subsequent maximal knee extensions at 180 degrees/sec. Gravity-corrected peak torques of the initial repetition and every fifth subsequent repetition were compared between groups, as were the percentages of decrease in torque (calculated relative to the initial torque) using two-way analysis of variance procedures. The results of these procedures demonstrated that the healthy subjects were significantly stronger than the patients with paresis (p less than .01) but that the patients had significantly better relative muscular endurance (ie, smaller percentages of decrease in torque) than the healthy subjects (p less than .05). These findings suggest that, for the patients tested, the relative muscular endurance of patients with paresis is not compromised. This finding does not preclude patients with paresis being unable to complete multiple repetitions of specific functional tasks requiring some critical level of muscular strength.\r"

In this study, muscle lengthening procedures were evaluated in the ankle plantar flexors. Four soleus muscle stretching procedures--static stretch (SS), hold relax (HR) (isometric plantar flexor contraction before stretch), agonist contract (AC) (dorsiflexor contraction assisting stretch), and hold relax-agonist contraction (HR-AC)--were performed in the sagittal plane by 12 physically active adults. The dorsiflexion angle, soleus muscle electromyogram, and soleus muscle motoneuron excitability as determined by the Hoffmann-reflex (H-reflex) amplitude were measured throughout the duration of each stretch. The range of dorsiflexion achieved at the end of the stretch did not differ significantly between stretching procedures, although in 8 of the 12 subjects and in the subject group as a whole, the AC and HR-AC procedures were associated with higher levels of soleus muscle EMG than the levels in the SS and HR procedures (p less than .01). The H-reflex amplitudes during the AC and HR-AC procedures were smaller than the amplitudes during the SS and HR procedures (p less than .001), suggesting the possibility of reciprocal inhibition during the agonist contraction. Increased tonic EMG levels produced by input from other neural pathways affecting alpha motoneurons in the AC and HR-AC procedures may have masked this inhibitory reflex. In healthy adults, a complicated procedure, involving muscle contractions for decreasing active resistance to stretch, may be unnecessary because active resistance to stretch is minimal and muscle relaxation during stretch appears to have little or no direct effect on the ROM achieved.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the isometric knee extension torques of male and female subjects during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs), electrical stimulation only, and electrical stimulation superimposed onto MVCs at electrical stimulation current frequencies of 20, 50, and 100 Hz. An asymmetrical, bidirectional, nonionizing waveform of 1-msec pulse duration was delivered through the femoral nerve and the superficial quadriceps femoris muscles at maximally tolerated intensity for each subject. The male subjects (n = 20) demonstrated significantly greater absolute torques under all contraction conditions than did the female subjects (n = 20) (p less than .01); when the torques were expressed as a percentage of each subject's MVC torque, however, no significant differences were observed between the sexes. Overall, the superimposed contractions at 50 and 100 Hz and the MVCs had similar torque values, all being significantly greater than the torque values produced by electrical stimulation only at frequencies of 20, 50, and 100 Hz and by the superimposed contractions at 20 Hz. Superimposing electrical stimulation onto MVCs did not result in greater torques than those produced by the MVCs alone. The three most effective contraction conditions, in terms of subject comfort (minimal discomfort) and increased torque, were the superimposed contractions at 50 and 100 Hz and MVCs alone, all of which involved a voluntary component.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of adding three 1-hour sessions of continuous passive motion (CPM) each day to the entire postoperative program of patients who received a total knee replacement (TKR). A retrospective chart review was completed for 55 patients (8 with bilateral involvement, totaling 63 knees) who received a TKR between 1981 and 1984. The data analysis compared the following variables for 32 patients who received CPM and 23 patients who received no CPM: the length of hospital stay (LOS), the number of postoperative days (PODs) before discharge, the frequency of postoperative complications, and the knee range of motion at discharge. The CPM Group showed significant decreases in the frequency of complications (p less than .05), the LOS (p less than .01), and in the number of PODs (p less than .001). No difference was demonstrated in the ROM of the two groups. These results support the use of postoperative applications of CPM, but not as strongly as those reported from studies that used longer periods of CPM. Further research is indicated to delineate the minimum dosage of CPM needed to obtain the maximum beneficial effects.\r"

  ".W": "The reliability of a computerized analysis system (CAS) for determining muscle burst onset was compared with the subjective assessments of three trained examiners. A sample of 154 randomly selected, full-wave rectified and filtered electromyographic recordings was evaluated using a test-retest paradigm. Percentages of agreement, Pearson product-moment correlations, analyses of variance (ANOVAs), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to measure the reliability. The between-rater agreement, which included the computerized EMG assessments, was only 23%. Within-rater agreement and Pearson correlation coefficients were perfect for CAS. The trained examiners' within-rater assessments averaged only 51% agreement, but test-retest correlations were high (r = .78 - r = .82). All ICCs were statistically significant, ranged from .46 to .60, and tended to be higher when the CAS onset determinations were deleted from the analysis. The ANOVAs revealed that trained examiners were more consistent among each other than when their assessments were compared with CAS assessments of EMG recordings. This finding, however, may be facility-specific in that any generalization to other examiners was limited. In contrast to trained examiners, the CAS was free of variations in judgment, ensured perfect reproducibility of trial assessments, and was highly useful for analyzing multi-channel EMG recordings. Although the CAS ensures perfect reliability, validity determinations require visual inspection of trial data.\r"

Chi-square tests (p less than .05) determined significant relationships between the participants' intentions to work with elderly people and their answers to 10 of the questions (1 biographical, 3 experiential, and 6 attitudinal). The answers to 1 of these experiential questions and 4 of these attitudinal questions were significant at the .001 level. No perceived socioeconomic questions were significant.

In an effort to define the physiology responsible for the efficacy of perfusion, the method of \"labeling\" hyperpermeable blood vessels with Monastral blue B in rat epigastric vascular island flaps was utilized. Results confirmed that capillary and venular hyperpermeability is an early and progressive pathophysiologic event in ischemic flap tissue and one which is reversible prior to a critical ischemic period. Perfusion washout with a physiologic, acellular plasma substitute delays the onset of vascular hyperpermeability. This may be a mechanism responsible for improving tissue survival following extended periods of warm ischemia (12 hours). It is implied that stagnant blood and products of hemolysis in the microcirculation may be detrimental to the functional and anatomic integrity of the endothelial wall.\r"

The miniplates provided stable fixation and, compared with other techniques, improved airway safety. The complication rate was low: there were no infections, but two plates (1 percent) became exposed in the buccal sulcus. Although application of miniplates lengthened surgery and increased the cost of the procedure, the savings in intensive care monitoring more than offset these costs. The stability of fixation minimizes the opportunity to reposition the fragments postoperatively with training elastics. Therefore, meticulous technique is mandatory, with particular emphasis on passive fitting of the plates and precise drilling of screw holes.\r"

A large clinical experience with long-term treatment results has never been reported for any substance used in orbital floor reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to review our long-term treatment results using Teflon for orbital floor reconstruction following blunt trauma, with emphasis on the incidence of infection, extrusion, and implant displacement. This report presents a 20-year review of 230 Teflon implants for reconstruction of traumatic orbital floor defects. With a mean follow-up period of 30 months, there was only one implant infection and no complications of extrusion or implant displacement. These findings support the use of Teflon as a safe and effective material for the reconstruction of orbital floor defects following blunt facial trauma.\r"

Five subjects were eliminated from both tasks and another four from connected-speech testing because of inability to complete the experimental tasks. Statistical analyses of ratings for words in 18 subjects and connected speech in 14 of them revealed no significant difference in acoustic speech intelligibility preoperatively and postoperatively. The findings suggest that a wedge-excision partial glossectomy in children with Down's syndrome does not result in significant improvement in acoustic speech intelligibility; in some patients, however, there may be an aesthetic improvement during speech.\r"

The poor results were all due to major complications and are analyzed in detail. Significant complications affecting the end result occurred in 14.5 percent of patients, and nonsignificant and minor complications occurred in 33 percent. Flap volume is shown to be fairly accurately predictable. Seventy percent of flaps had a volume in excess of 400 cc. The reconstructed volume, cosmetic results, and complication rates are compared with those of other reported series.

The radioactive microsphere technique demonstrated that after 4 weeks beneath a musculocutaneous flap, isolated bone segments had significant blood flow, whereas bone beneath a cutaneous flap did not. The muscle flap bone had a blood flow approximately half that of normal control bone. The muscle of the musculocutaneous flap had a blood flow three times that of the skin of the cutaneous flap. The bipedicle cutaneous flap used was designed to have a healthy blood supply, and at 4 weeks it had a blood flow twice that of control skin. Despite this, there was essentially no demonstrable blood flow in the cutaneous flap bone segments at 4 weeks. Only 3 of 17 bone segments underneath cutaneous flaps showed medullary vascularization, whereas 10 of 11 muscle flap bones did. All bone segments underneath muscle flaps showed osteoblasts and osteoclasts at 4 weeks; neither were seen in the cutaneous bone segments. The process of revascularization occurred through an intact cortex and penetrated into the cancellous bone. Because the bone segments were surrounded by an impervious barrier except for one cortical surface, the cellular activity seen is attributed to revascularization by the overlying flap. In this model, a muscle flap was superior to a cutaneous flap in revascularizing isolated bone segments at 4 weeks. This was documented by blood flow measured by the radioactive microsphere technique and by bone histology.\r"

  ".W": "In traumatic injuries to the extremities, with a circulatory insufficiency, the resultant ischemia leads to decreasing levels of the energy-rich compounds adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) and increasing levels of lactate in muscle. A tourniquet model for temporary ischemia was used to determine if hyperbaric oxygen treatment could enhance the cellular metabolic restitution when the circulation was restored. The circulation of the rat hindlimb was interrupted for 1.5 and 3 hours. After 1.5 hours of ischemia, the levels of adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, and lactate were restored to normal in muscle biopsies taken 5 hours after the ischemia. After 3 hours of ischemia, there were marked reductions of adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine and elevated lactate values in the postischemic muscle, indicating severe ischemic damage. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment at 2.5 atm for 45 minutes reduced these changes significantly. A certain number of hyperbaric oxygen treatments were necessary to maintain this effect. It is concluded that repeated hyperbaric oxygen treatments in the postischemic phase stimulate aerobic metabolism.\r"

Group 1 rats served as controls, group 2 rats were hemodiluted with Ringer's lactate, and group 3 rats were hemodiluted with Fluosol-DA (20%). All groups were kept in a high (80%) oxygen environment for 48 hours. Areas of necrosis were measured using a computer system. Necrosis in control flaps averaged 14.96 percent; in flaps hemodiluted with Ringer's lactate, 10.12 percent; in flaps hemodiluted with Fluosol, 4.76 percent. These differences were statistically significant. We conclude that fluorocarbons significantly enhance flap survival in rats.\r"

Specifically, the study assessed possible motion of the IUD in the magnetic field, potential of the IUD to heat up during two spin-echo imaging sequences commonly used in MR imaging of the pelvis (2,000/30 and 60 [repetition time, msec/echo time, msec], and 500/30), and the appearance on MR images of the IUD devices. A retrospective review of MR images of the pelvis in six women who had an IUD in place was also performed. Results show that an IUD does not move under the influence of the magnetic field, does not heat during spin-echo sequences commonly used for pelvic imaging, and does not produce artifacts in vitro or in vivo. Patients with either type of IUD can be safely imaged with MR, and MR images of the pelvis are not degraded by the presence of an IUD.\r"

However, when transverse T1- and T2-weighted images supplemented by additional T2-weighted coronal or sagittal images were studied, accuracy increased to 83%. At present, MR imaging is the most accurate diagnostic modality for the local staging of carcinoma of the prostate, but for optimal results, multiple sequences and two orthogonal planes of imaging are needed.\r"

The most frequent presenting symptom was an abdominal mass or pain. All 14 patients underwent CT, and 11 underwent selective renal angiography. The diagnosis of renal sarcoma should be suspected when CT findings suggest that the tumor arises from the renal capsule or renal sinus and when the tumor is hypovascular or avascular on angiograms. The characteristic negative attenuation values for liposarcomas permit a specific diagnosis. Sarcomas that originate in the renal parenchyma and SRCC cannot be easily differentiated from renal cell carcinoma; however, renal sarcomas do not appear to have a propensity for extension into the renal vein or the inferior vena cava.\r"

Urinalysis was normal in nine patients and showed microscopic hematuria in nine, gross hematuria in four, and proteinuria in four. Radiologically, metastases were usually multifocal; however, metastases arising from colon, lung, and breast carcinoma were sometimes large, solitary, and otherwise indistinguishable from primary renal cell carcinoma. Three of four melanoma metastases and three of seven lung metastases infiltrated the perinephric space. Computed tomography was the most sensitive modality, depicting renal metastases in all 24 cases in which it was employed, followed by ultrasound and intravenous urography. In patients with a history of malignancy, renal metastases outnumbered renal cell carcinomas by approximately 4:1. This study indicates that a new renal lesion in a patient with advanced, noncurable cancer is more likely metastatic than primary and that biopsy in this setting is unlikely to be of aid.\r"

In all patients, thin sections showed an increase in the number of peripheral lines (1-2 cm in length) that were diffuse in generalized disease and localized in focal disease. Normal peripheral arcades were not increased in number, but the limbs forming the arcades were thickened in all patients. A diffuse increase in linear and curvilinear structures (reticular pattern) was seen toward the center of the lung. Polygonal structures 1-2 cm in diameter were seen in seven patients with LS but not in healthy subjects. Fissures were thickened in nine patients. Selected 1.5-mm-thick CT sections are recommended through abnormal areas (seen at CT or on chest radiographs) or if these are normal at three levels (midapex, hilus, and 3 cm above the diaphragm) when scanning patients with tumors known to cause LS.\r"

A significant correlation was found between the extent of disease as assessed with CT and the severity of dyspnea (r = .62, P less than .001), as well as between CT and impairment in gas exchange as assessed by the diffusing capacity (r = .64, P less than .001).

The mediastinal portion of the bronchial artery was successfully outlined as nodular or linear densities on all dynamic CT scans. The right bronchial artery was confirmed to arise from the medial wall of the thoracic aorta, whereas the left arises from the anterior wall. Because of its retroesophageal location, the enlarged right bronchial artery can compress the posterior wall of the esophagus.

On five of the T2-weighted images, the fibroadenomas gave a signal equal to or slightly greater than that of normal fibroglandular tissue; five showed a marked increase in intensity, and two gave a low signal intensity. Four fibroadenomas were inhomogeneous on both T1- and T2-weighted images, and two additional lesions became inhomogeneous on T2-weighted images. No consistent correlations were found between MR appearances and histopathologic findings in the fibroadenomas.

Of 110 patients with US or surgical evidence of cholelithiasis, gallstones were demonstrated on CT images of 87 (79.1% sensitivity). Overall accuracy was 89.8%, while specificity was 100%. On CT images stones could appear densely (48.3%) or slightly (11.5%) calcified, as an area with a rim of increased density (21.8%), as an area of soft-tissue density (14.9%), or as an area of low density (3.4%). Stone size, stone density, section incrementation, and the pericholecystic anatomy affected the detection rate.

  ".W": "The value of a recently reported grading system of early abdominal computed tomography (CT) for predicting development of pancreatic abscess in patients with acute pancreatitis was reassessed. When the previously described CT grading system was used in another patient population, it did not demonstrate the same degree of prognostic value of baseline CT. In this series pancreatic abscess occurred in only eight of 29 patients (28%) with grade E CT scans (with grade E representing the most severe involvement), compared with 60% in the previous series. Of 44 patients with either grade D or E baseline CT scans, abscesses developed in only 30%, with a minimum clinical follow-up of 3 months. A second grading system, which used a semiquantitative analysis of the degree of peripancreatic inflammation (a \"CT severity score\"), also did not strongly correlate with the future risk of abscess, The authors conclude that early abdominal CT should be performed selectively in patients with acute pancreatitis and reserved for patients who are either diagnostic dilemmas or who fail to respond to supportive treatment and have clinically suspected surgical complications such as pancreatic abscess.\r"

Using technetium-99m sulfur colloid, one can evaluate the completeness of peritoneal fluid distribution. Forty-eight planar IP scans from 26 patients with gastrointestinal malignancies were reviewed and scan findings were correlated with the site of primary tumor, surgical findings, and the location of any residual disease. Of the 26 patients, 22 had undergone resection of the primary lesion prior to scanning. Scans typically demonstrated more activity in the upper and lower portions of the abdomen than in the midabdomen. Diminished uptake in the pelvis, right lower quadrant, and right upper quadrant was generally due to metastases. A tumor mass was identified as responsible in only one of eight patients with diminished or absent left upper quadrant activity. Knowledge of variability in patterns seen on IP scans is essential to rational guidance of IP chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\r"

Particular attention was given to bowel found posterior to the kidneys (retrorenal colon): its frequency of occurrence on 500 scans of supine patients was 1.9%, but 10.0% in the 90 prone patients. Because most invasive renal procedures would not intersect with retrorenal colon located behind the lateral one-third of the kidney, the data were reevaluated after deletion of these patients, giving a frequency in prone patients of 4.7%. This was found exclusively at the level of the lower renal poles, and the involved colon was extensively distended with gas. Attention should be given at fluoroscopy to detect this unusual, posteriorly positioned, air-filled colon before any invasive renal procedure.\r"

The findings include equal density of the superior mediastinal nodule and the thymic lobes anterior to the ascending aorta, no displacement or narrowing of adjacent arteries, absence of a fat plane between the nodule and the thymic lobes, and parallel reduction in size of the nodule and the rest of the thymus. Two patients were examined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Sagittal MR images demonstrated continuity of the superior mediastinal nodule with the more caudal portion of the thymus. Recognition of this normal variant in children is important in order to avoid unnecessary mediastinal biopsies or overstaging of malignancies.\r"

Of these 25 injuries, angiographic examination revealed significant vascular damage in 11. In 36 injuries physical findings indicated minor injury, with proximity to major vessels or nonexpanding hematoma being the only indication for arteriography. None of these patients had significant vascular injuries. Physical examination was found to be 100% sensitive in screening for significant vascular injuries. These results indicate that arteriography is unwarranted in stab wounds to the extremities if the only indications are proximity to major vessels or nonexpanding hematoma.\r"

Seven (54%) of the 3-mm stents remained patent. Stent wires were completely covered by a proliferation of the intima. No stent migration, occlusion of side branches, or vessel wall perforation was observed. A stent/artery ratio (SAR) was computed using stent and recipient vessel diameters. Good vascular patency was observed when the SAR was less than or equal to 1.2. An SAR greater than 1.2 was associated with immediate spasm, immediate or delayed thrombosis, or excessive intimal proliferation. Selection of correct stent size is a major determinant of patency in small arteries.\r"

A stent with a 2.5-cm-long body and wire skirts on both ends was most suitable for EIPCA creation. Well-positioned stents shunted most of the portal blood in the inferior vena cava circulation and remained patent for 4-6 weeks. Ingrowth of liver parenchyma and abundant proliferation of the intima and connective tissue inside the stent lumen in these rapidly growing animals gradually decreased EIPCA patency, and thrombus formation with diminished blood flow closed them completely.\r"

These examinations reliably demonstrated the changes in anatomy caused by removal of the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and false vocal cords. Fourteen patients had documented recurrence of cancer; five mucosal, nine extramucosal. Three of five macroscopic mucosal recurrences in the larynx/pharynx were detected on the barium pharyngograms; the two mucosal lesions not seen were in the base of the tongue and tonsillar fossa. CT enabled detection of five of five recurrences and was superior to pharyngography in demonstrating the soft-tissue extent of disease.

Small white-matter lesions were found in 12. In these 12, zones of atrophic perivascular demyelination were present in eight brains. These are not the familiar thrombotic, embolic, or ischemic vascular lesions that produce acute necrosis. This mild vascular insufficiency produces atrophy, which has been recognized in the pathology literature but whose clinical significance remains unknown. Other lesions seen were small vascular malformations in the centrum ovale in four brains, diverticula of the lateral ventricle extending into the white matter in three, and an isolated central white-matter infarction in one. All of these lesions are probably the basis of the patchy white-matter lesions seen on MR imaging studies in the neurologically healthy elderly population.\r"

This time savings occurs because repetition time (TR) is reduced when imaging is performed with partial flips. Partial flip MR imaging can also improve signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in fast body imaging. For this study, analytical tools were used to predict image contrast and S/N for short TR, partial flip sequences. Experimental implementation of the short TR, partial flip sequences that analytical work had predicted would be optimal supported the analytical predictions and demonstrated their validity. Partial flip MR imaging is applicable to reducing imaging time only when the ratio of signal differences to noise exceeds threshold values in conventional MR images. Partial flip sequences can be used to advantage in MR imaging of both the head and the body, and the observed effects are predictable through theoretical analysis.\r"

In two cases MR imaging depicted bone infarcts not seen on both radionuclide bone scans and standard radiographs. The highly detailed depiction of the articular cartilage was of particular importance in predicting arthroscopic findings in cases of osteochondritis dissecans. In two cases, a soft-tissue mass (pigmented villonodular synovitis) and a large osteochondral fragment undetected at arthroscopy were accurately localized with MR imaging.

  ".W": "Forty-three professional and amateur athletes with persistent shoulder pain that interfered with their sports activities were evaluated by computed tomographic (CT) arthrography. In 19 patients, glenohumeral instability (14 anterior, two posterior, three multidirectional) was diagnosed with CT arthrography based on the simultaneous presence of labral and capsular lesions. The findings were crucial in establishing the diagnosis of instability in six patients in whom the condition was not suggested or could not be confirmed clinically. Another significant injury consisted of labral lesions not associated with glenohumeral instability. These tears often involved the anterior and parasuperior segments of this structure. Other, less frequently detected lesions included segmental labral enlargement and several labra with abnormal orientation (everted labrum). Early onset of degenerative disease was present in many athletes, especially those with a long history of sports activity. CT arthrographic findings were correlated with arthroscopic or surgical results in 19 patients.\r"

MR imaging was found to be superior to CT without contrast material and equal to CT with contrast material in delineating the anatomic relationships of the tumors, including bone involvement, spinal canal invasion, paraspinal soft-tissue extension, and vascular involvement. Since MR imaging can provide most of the anatomic information necessary for treatment planning, intrathecal injection of contrast material can be avoided in most instances when evaluating tumor involvement of the osseous spine. However, CT without contrast medium was superior to MR imaging in showing critical cortical bone destruction and calcified tumor matrix.\r"

The growth of children with cataract was obviously retarded (in terms of both height and body weight) when compared with that of other CRS children; the growth of the latter group (height and weight) was almost the same as that of the general healthy population by school age, although all CRS children were small in the preschool years. All children with CRS had smaller head circumferences than control children, with the smallest for the cataract group. The data indicate that children supposedly exposed to maternal clinical rubella before the 60th day of gestation grew poorly at least until the age of 17 years, whereas those supposedly infected after the 60th day began to return to a normal growth pattern from early school age.\r"

Outbreaks have occurred in all of the northern provinces and in some of the southern provinces of China. The toxin found most frequently in the northwest region of China was type A; in north China, type B; and in the northeast, type E. The most frequently offending food was home-made strong-smelling preserved bean curd, which was implicated in 74% of the outbreaks. The complex clinical manifestations of botulism can be grouped into those affecting the eyes, the mouth, the pharynx, and the skeletal muscles. Following the institution of effective methods of prevention and treatment, epidemics of botulism in China have been controlled and the mortality rate reduced from 41% (1950s) to 7.6% (1983).\r"

Noncompartmental and compartmental calculations resulted in similar pharmacokinetic parameters. Linear pharmacokinetics were found in the concentration range studied. The mean terminal-phase half-life was 1.75 hr, the mean total plasma clearance was 180 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and the mean apparent volume of distribution was 340 ml/kg. Approximately 70%-80% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. In children with cystic fibrosis, both total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution were significantly increased. The data support the intravenous administration of 12.5-25 mg of sulbactam/kg every 6 to 8 hr for assessing the adequacy of this drug as an adjunct to beta-lactam therapy for various bacterial infections in children.\r"

The results show that the sulbactam/ampicillin preparation for parenteral administration is compatible with all diluents recommended for ampicillin sodium. In all diluents sulbactam was more stable than ampicillin. At the end of the reported use periods, the average retention value for sulbactam in the combination solutions was 96% (range, 91%-101%), whereas the average retention value for ampicillin in the same solutions was 90% (range, 84%-95%).

The peak serum level from a 15-min infusion of 1 g/2 g of sulbactam/ampicillin is more than seven times this 90% end point. Excellent bactericidal activity was demonstrated against ampicillin-resistant isolates. Ampicillin-resistant strains did not develop resistance to sulbactam/ampicillin when they were serially transferred in the presence of sublethal concentrations of the combination. In mice the combination was active against a variety of acute, fatal infections produced by ampicillin-resistant bacterial isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and mixed anaerobes.

Mean peak concentrations of sulbactam (19.4 micrograms/ml) and ampicillin (471 micrograms/ml) in the bile occurred 0.5-1 hr after administration. Biliary excretion was estimated to account for approximately 0.24% of the sulbactam dose and 2.8% of the ampicillin dose. Fourteen other patients received the same dose of sulbactam/ampicillin immediately before elective cholecystectomy. Respective mean concentrations of sulbactam and ampicillin at the time of gallbladder removal were 4.3 micrograms/ml and 15.9 micrograms/ml in gallbladder bile and 6.3 micrograms/g and 7.7 micrograms/g in gallbladder wall tissue.

The groups were comparable in terms of sex and degree of illness; however, more patients treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin than patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin were younger than 12 months of age (78% vs. 56%). Pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 65 (80%) of the 81 patients. In the sulbactam/ampicillin group, there were 18 Haemophilus influenzae isolates (one resistant to ampicillin), five Streptococcus pneumoniae, five Neisseria meningitidis, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one Listeria. In the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group, there were 19 H. influenzae isolates, 10 S. pneumoniae, three N. meningitidis, one Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and one Citrobacter. Of 63 patients with assessable CSF pathogens, one (3%) of 29 treated with sulbactam/ampicillin died (S. pneumoniae) and six (18%) of 34 treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin died (two, H. influenzae; three, S. pneumoniae; and one, Citrobacter). Twelve percent in the sulbactam/ampicillin group and 18% in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group had neurologic sequelae. No clinically significant reactions or toxicities were noted. Sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as chloramphenicol/ampicillin in the treatment of meningitis.\r"

In a single-blind, randomized trial, the efficacy of sulbactam plus ampicillin was compared with that of metronidazole plus cefotaxime. Thirty-five children undergoing appendectomy received intravenous sulbactam and ampicillin, while 38 children received metronidazole and cefotaxime. Single doses were given unless the appendix was considered gangrenous or perforated, in which case the drugs were administered for 72 hr. There were three wound infections in the group given sulbactam and ampicillin and five in the group given metronidazole and cefotaxime. The combination of sulbactam and ampicillin was well tolerated and appeared to be at least as effective as that of metronidazole and cefotaxime in the prevention of sepsis following appendectomy.\r"

Treatment resulted in the rapid degeneration of the striatonigral pathway including projections containing the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and delayed transneuronal death of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The distribution of nigral cell loss corresponded to the loss of GABAergic terminals. Neuronal death was prevented by long-term intraventricular infusion of the GABA agonist muscimol. Delayed transneuronal degeneration may be produced by neuronal disinhibition consequent to loss of inhibitory inputs. Replacement of inhibitory transmitters by suitable drugs may prevent some forms of delayed neuronal death.\r"

This type of intercellular communication can restore the activity of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in mammalian cells that are deficient in the enzyme UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase. Pure cultures of the 4-epimerase mutant are unable to synthesize normal carbohydrate chains on LDL receptors and many other glycoproteins and therefore do not express LDL receptor activity. When these cells are cocultivated with cells expressing normal 4-epimerase activity, the structure and function of LDL receptors are restored to normal by the transfer of this enzyme's products through intercellular junctions. The formation of functional junctions does not require normal glycosylation of membrane proteins. Because many convenient assays and selections for LDL receptor activity are available, this mutant can provide a powerful new tool for biochemical and genetic studies of intercellular junctional communication.\r"

The amplitude of the anomalous rectifier conductance was increased by adding serotonin, but the shapes of the conductance-voltage curve and the power spectrum were not altered. Calculation of the number of functional channels and of the single-channel conductance from the power spectra indicates that the serotonin-induced increase in conductance resulted from an increase in the number of functional channels, while the single-channel conductance and the open-channel probability were unchanged.\r"

This gene has been shown to be amplified in human breast cancer cell lines. In the current study, alterations of the gene in 189 primary human breast cancers were investigated. HER-2/neu was found to be amplified from 2- to greater than 20-fold in 30% of the tumors. Correlation of gene amplification with several disease parameters was evaluated. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in patients with breast cancer. It retained its significance even when adjustments were made for other known prognostic factors. Moreover, HER-2/neu amplification had greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic factors, including hormonal-receptor status, in lymph node-positive disease. These data indicate that this gene may play a role in the biologic behavior and/or pathogenesis of human breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The structure of Mengo virus, a representative member of the cardio picornaviruses, is substantially different from the structures of rhino- and polioviruses. The structure of Mengo virus was solved with the use of human rhinovirus 14 as an 8 A resolution structural approximation. Phase information was then extended to 3 A resolution by use of the icosahedral symmetry. This procedure gives promise that many other virus structures also can be determined without the use of the isomorphous replacement technique. Although the organization of the major capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 of Mengo virus is essentially the same as in rhino- and polioviruses, large insertions and deletions, mostly in VP1, radically alter the surface features. In particular, the putative receptor binding \"canyon\" of human rhinovirus 14 becomes a deep \"pit\" in Mengo virus because of polypeptide insertions in VP1 that fill part of the canyon. The minor capsid peptide, VP4, is completely internal in Mengo virus, but its association with the other capsid proteins is substantially different from that in rhino- or poliovirus. However, its carboxyl terminus is located at a position similar to that in human rhinovirus 14 and poliovirus, suggesting the same autocatalytic cleavage of VP0 to VP4 and VP2 takes place during assembly in all these picornaviruses.\r"

After DNA sequences responsible for negative autoregulation were removed, the 16-kilodalton protein was overproduced and purified to more than 90 percent homogeneity by a salt extraction procedure that yields about 5 milligrams of protein per gram of cells. Complementation data, amino terminal analysis, gel filtration, and deoxyribonuclease I protection studies demonstrate that the purified merR gene product is a dimer under nondenaturing conditions and that it binds specifically to DNA, in the presence and absence of mercury, at a palindromic site which is directly between the -10 and -35 regions of the structural genes and adjacent to its own promoter. These initial results indicate that MerR is a DNA-binding metalloregulatory protein that plays a central role in this heavy metal responsive system and they delineate an operator site in the mer operon.\r"

After 2 weeks of NGF treatment, identification of cholinergic neurons by the presence of the biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase revealed a dramatic increase (350%) in the survival of the axotomized septal cholinergic neurons. Thus, NGF or an NGF-like molecule can act as a neurotrophic factor for these neurons.\r"

This is expected to have important consequences for the interpretation of the activity of transport proteins and enzymes. Different minima correspond to changes in the relative orientation of the helices coupled with side-chain rearrangements that preserve the close packing of the protein interior. The conformational space sampled by the simulation is similar to that found in the evolutionary development of the globins. Glasslike behavior is expected at low temperatures.

The magnetic direction toward which nudibranchs spontaneously oriented in the geomagnetic field showed recurring patterns of variation correlated with lunar phase, suggesting that the behavioral response to magnetism is modulated by a circa-lunar rhythm. The discovery of a magnetic sense in a mollusk with giant, reidentifiable neurons provides a unique opportunity to study the cellular mechanisms underlying magnetic field detection.\r"

In these cells, as in peripheral axons, tubulin is transported in coherent, nondiffusing waves at two different slow rates that are within the range of the slow components a and b of axonal transport measured in vivo. Finally, it appears that most, if not all, of the tubulin analog is moving out these processes. Thus, slow neuroplasmic transport in cultured neuron-like cells is a good model of axonal transport, in which experimental manipulations of the system can be performed that would be difficult in the whole animal.\r"

  ".U": "87094212\r", 
  ".W": "The inflammatory reaction of human neutrophils consists of two successive phases. In the first, designated chemotaxis, the cells home in on a foreign intruder. In the second, the cells attempt to eliminate the intruder by secreting lysosomal enzymes and superoxide anions. The initiation of chemotaxis involves prompt morphological changes that are manifested by a sharp biphasic drop in light scattering, accompanied by a transient cytosolic acidification. In a search for a causal relation between these two events, the neutrophil cytoplasm was abruptly acidified by the application of sodium propionate. This evoked a pulse of decreasing light-scattering, the time course and amplitude of which were practically identical to the rapid response induced by chemoattractants such as N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP). Both fMLP- and sodium propionate-induced responses were unaffected by amiloride, but were inhibited with a similar dose-dependence by a series of proton uncouplers. The initial phase of the cytosolic acidification seems, therefore, to fulfill the criteria for a second messenger for the initiation of chemotaxis.\r"

The effects of activators of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C on resting membrane properties, action potentials, and currents recorded from mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons and cerebral hemisphere neurons grown in primary dissociated cell culture were investigated. Neither forskolin (FOR) nor phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) altered resting membrane properties but both increased the duration of calcium-dependent action potentials in both central and peripheral neurons. By means of the single-electrode voltage clamp technique, FOR and PDBu were shown to decrease the same voltage-dependent potassium conductance. This suggests that two independent second messenger systems may affect the same potassium conductance.\r"

The antidepressant response to morning light was accompanied by an advance (shift to an earlier time) in the onset of nighttime melatonin production. These results suggest that timing may be critical for the antidepressant effects of bright light.\r"

This RNA species has now been purified and identified as transfer RNA (tRNA). The three tRNA's for the basic amino acids accounted for about 78% of the total amino acid-accepting activity [arginine (52%), lysine (17%), and histidine (9%)], while the remaining 22% was represented by six other tRNA species. This tRNA-binding activity of the glucocorticoid receptor may reflect post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulating gene expression, such as alterations in the translational efficiency of or the modulation of the stability of hormone-induced proteins.\r"

An L-arginine-dependent biochemical pathway synthesizing L-citrulline and nitrite, coupled to an effector mechanism, is now shown to cause this pattern of metabolic inhibition. Murine cytotoxic activated macrophages synthesize L-citrulline and nitrite in the presence of L-arginine but not D-arginine. L-Citrulline and nitrite biosynthesis by cytotoxic activated macrophages is inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, which also inhibits this cytotoxic effector mechanism. This activated macrophage cytotoxic effector system is associated with L-arginine deiminase activity, and the imino nitrogen removed from the guanido group of L-arginine by the deiminase reaction subsequently undergoes oxidation to nitrite. L-Homoarginine, an alternative substrate for this deiminase, is converted to L-homocitrulline with concurrent nitrite synthesis and similar biologic effects.\r"

The wounds were confined to the chest in 24 patients (31%) and involved both the chest and abdomen in seven cases (9%). Of the 53 abdominal wounds, 21 necessitated celiotomy; in 20 of them, an intra-abdominal organ was found injured, and one patient died (1.9%). Of the 24 injuries confined to the chest, only one patient required emergency thoracotomy due to massive hemorrhage; all 24 patients survived. All of the seven thoracoabdominal injuries, two produced by gunshot and five by stabbing, necessitated celiotomy. Most patients with gunshot wounds to the back and flanks require celiotomy, but a selective therapy can be safely used in patients with stab wounds. The rate of negative exploratory celiotomy was less than 5%; the mortality was 1.3%.\r"

A policy of selective exploration based on clinical presentation, anatomic location, and results of diagnostic studies has been followed at The Cooper Green Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, for the past 13 years. We report a study of penetrating neck wounds in 136 consecutive patients admitted to The Cooper Green Hospital from 1972 to 1984. Seventy-seven patients (57%) had exploration immediately, with one death, while the remaining 59 (43%) were admitted and observed. Of these 59 patients, ten had arch aortography and nine had esophagography, all of which yielded normal results. The remainder of the patients observed had no clinical signs or symptoms to suggest a major injury. There were no deaths or complications related to the neck wounds in the 59 patients observed. Results of 27 explorations (35%) were negative. We conclude that selective exploration of penetrating neck wounds is both safe and reasonable.\r"

The presence of a mass lesion on mammography with or without microcalcifications was associated with malignancy more frequently than microcalcifications alone. In 15 cases (12.4%), biopsy showed malignancy; 13 patients had modified radical mastectomy, with 11 (85%) having no histologic evidence of axillary metastases. Evaluation of risk factors associated with breast cancer in those patients with positive biopsy results showed that advanced age and a past history of a breast cancer were present in a significant number of patients. Four patients (3.5%) had complications; a hematoma developed in one (0.8%), and three (2.7%) required a second biopsy to remove the suggestive mammographic lesion. We conclude that needle-localized breast biopsy is a reliable tool in detecting early breast carcinoma. The procedure causes only minimal morbidity and we believe it should be done in all patients with mammographically suggestive, nonpalpable breast lesions.\r"

When bacteriologic confirmation was attained, the diagnosis suggested by skin testing was correct. Treatment regimens for non-M tuberculosis (atypical) mycobacterial disease varied: a two- to three-drug regimen in the treatment of M avium or M intracellulare disease was ineffective and inappropriate, whereas a five-drug regimen without surgical excision of residual disease produced good results. Combining surgical resection with the five-drug regimen before and after operation produced the best results, however, with all patients showing apparent cure.\r"

All patients underwent preprocedural cystoscopy for stone manipulation and 27 of the patients had the stones dislodged proximally. The stone-free success rate for this group of dislodged stones was 93 per cent. Of 39 ureteral stones treated in situ (impacted), 33 patients were rendered stone-free at three months. Three stones in this group failed to disintegrate and required surgical treatment. Complications of ESWL were minimal. ESWL of upper ureteral stones is an effective noninvasive, noncontact method of treatment. Successful stone manipulation increased the stone-free rate, yet impacted stones disintegrated and passed in 85 per cent of treatments. Lithotripsy of small renal stones prior to migration and proximal ureteral stones early in the symptomatic course may significantly alter the incidence of distal ureteral calculi requiring hospitalization, cystoscopy or ureteroscopy.\r"

Only those instances when the injury was due to blunt trauma and resulted in complete occlusion of the renal artery, documented by roentgenographic means, were included in this review. Avulsion injuries, incomplete occlusion or branch artery injuries were also excluded. In order to be classified as a surgical success, postoperative documentation of renal function and a patent renal artery were required. Only nine successfully performed vascularization procedures were identified. There were four instances of bilateral obstruction with postoperative serum creatinine levels ranging from 1.77 to 7.1 milligrams per deciliter. All required postoperative dialysis ranging from three days to three months in duration. Thirty-five patients with an unilaterally obstructed renal artery underwent attempted revascularization. Five patients, all with a presumed ischemic time of less than 12 hours, had a successful outcome. Postoperatively, four patients demonstrated either a decrease in size or function of the injured kidney. Thirteen eventually required nephrectomy.\r"

The age at onset of symptoms, the interval between onset of symptoms and operation, the site of disease, operations performed, the type and frequency of repeat operations and the morbidity, mortality and follow-up period were studied. The small intestine only was involved in 55 per cent of the patients, the large intestine only in 16 per cent, and both the small and large intestine in 29 per cent. The most frequent indication for operation was obstruction (29 per cent); the next was perianal disease (18 per cent). The most common procedure was resection of the lowest segment of the small intestine with adjacent colon (37 per cent). The second most common operation was perianal operation (19 per cent). There were three deaths (2 per cent mortality rate). One hundred and thirty patients (93 per cent) have been examined within the past three years.

The fistulas were colovesical in 18, ileovesical in four and rectovesical and appendicovesical in one each. Fifteen of the 23 patients in whom this information was available had pneumaturia and four had fecaluria. The standard battery of diagnostic tests for enterovesical fistulas was performed. Thirteen patients with colovesical fistulas had small intestinal series; the fistula was demonstrated in only five patients. Sixteen patients had an intravenous pyelogram and the fistula was demonstrated in none. Cystoscopy was performed upon 15 patients and the fistula was demonstrated in one. A cystogram was performed upon ten patients and the fistula was demonstrated in four. In contrast, all patients had positive computed tomographic findings. The pathognomonic finding of air within the bladder was demonstrated in 20 of 23 patients without recent transurethral instrumentation. All 24 computed tomographic scans demonstrated an abnormally thickened segment of intestine in intimate contact with a thickened bladder wall at the site of the fistula. This was associated with a paravesical mass in 23 of the patients. Two of the four patients in whom bladder air was not seen had a vesical fistula of the small intestine. All 24 fistulas were confirmed by operation (22 patients) or subsequent clinical course (two patients). These findings suggest that computed tomography is the most accurate diagnostic tool available for demonstrating enterovesical fistulas. Computed tomography should supplant the use of other less sensitive diagnostic test currently included in the evaluation of patients with a suspected enterovesical fistula.\r"

The shock group was compared with a group of dogs not given endotoxin and infused with a similar dose of Ringer's lactate solution and a with control group of dogs. Prenodal lymph was collected from both hindpaws and three to four hours before ending an increase of 20 to 28 millimeters of mercury in venous pressure of the hindpaw was produced in one limb by tightening a tourniquet. This maneuver produced an increase in lymph flow associated with an increase in lymph protein flux that was similar in all three groups. The wet to dry tissue weight ratio of skin samples did not increase in the endotoxin group. Skin microvascular membrane permeability did not increase. The safety factors that helped to prevent edema after infusion of Ringer's lactate solution included an increase in lymph flow and sieving by the intact microvascular membrane which diluted the interstitial protein concentration.\r"

Not included were early complications after the initial operation or endoscopic manipulation. The indications for reoperations were obstructive jaundice, recurrent colic and asymptomatic biliary fistula in 57, 18 and three patients, respectively. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was found to be the preoperative diagnostic method of choice. Intraoperative examination demonstrated cholangiolithiasis in 48 patients (five patients with stenosis), stenosis of the bile duct in eight, sump syndrome after choledochoduodenostomy in six and cholangitis without any further pathology in three. In three patients, the revision was negative. Several reinterventions were carried out: exploration of the bile ducts (12 per cent with papillotomy), removal of a biliodigestive anastomosis and a biliary enteric anastomosis in 52, 12 and 14 patients, respectively. The postoperative cholangiogram showed residual stones in 12 patients. Two-thirds of the stones disappeared spontaneously and one-third were removed endoscopically. There were local complications in 12 of the patients. The mortality rate was 6.4 per cent. All of these patients were more than 70 years old and were considered at high risk. In spite of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, the number of operative reinterventions upon the biliary duct system has hardly declined over the last few years. This is partly due to new specific complications in connection with endoscopic retrograde endoscopy (perforation, hemorrhage or pancreatitis).\r"

In our series, carcinoma developed in eight of 82 patients with choledochal cyst and three of the eight had secondary carcinoma occurring several years after enteric drainage. Forty-two similar instances and 235 instances of primary carcinoma have been reported in Japan. The mean age at detection of carcinoma in enteric drainage was 35 years old, 15 years less than that of primary carcinoma. The mean interval between drainage and detection of carcinoma was ten years. Carcinoma mainly arose from the retained cyst in drainage, while primary carcinoma developed in either the cyst or gallbladder. The prognosis was very poor. Almost all patients undergoing enteric drainage died soon after the detection of carcinoma. This is possibly due to the delay in diagnosis. Pancreatic juice can easily regurgitate into the choledochus through an anomalous junction of the pancreatobiliary ductal system, and enteric drainage causes pancreatic juice in the cyst to become activated due to the influx of intestinal juice. Therefore, inflammatory changes of the cyst are accelerated and probably result in carcinoma. Early excision of the choledocus should be recommended in patients with choledochal cyst retained after enteric drainage.\r"

Four types of hepatectomies n which the IRHV was preserved were proposed and three of the four procedures were performed upon five patients. In these five operations, the hepatectomies were successfully performed and blood losses were from 1,020 to 3,200 milliliters. These operative procedures, which have not been described before, could widen the indication of hepatectomy in patients with reduced liver function and tumor involving the right hepatic vein.

  ".W": "Management of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (Wermer's syndrome) who have concurrent hypercalcemia and hypergastrinemia is controversial. The usual therapeutic approach has been to perform parathyroidectomy first before surgery for ulcer disease in an effort to decrease serum calcium concentration and presumably remove one of the stimuli for both gastrin and gastric acid secretion. We present the history of a 48-year-old man with primary hyperparathyroidism and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome who underwent acid secretory studies and secretin stimulation tests before and after parathyroidectomy. We also studied the effect of calcium channel blockade on gastrin and gastric acid secretion, since calcium influx into endocrine cells, such as the gastrinoma cell, is thought to be critical in hormone secretion. Although parathyroidectomy reduced serum calcium and parathormone levels to normal, basal serum gastrin concentration and basal acid output remained unchanged. The peak rise in serum gastrin concentration after secretin injection was less after parathyroidectomy than before parathyroidectomy but was still abnormal. During administration of verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist, no change was seen in the serum gastrin concentration, secretin test response, or acid secretion. Basal acid output was 45.4 mmol/hr before parathyroidectomy or verapamil and 54.0 and 50.4 mmol/hr after parathyroidectomy or verapamil, respectively. In contrast, a small but significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in serum parathormone concentration occurred during treatment with verapamil, an observation that to the best of our knowledge has not been previously reported in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Gastric emptying was studied in 18 symptomatic and 16 asymptomatic patients after Billroth II (BII) resection (without vagotomy) and the possible relationships between emptying and postprandial symptoms in these patients were assessed. The BII patients were compared with 20 nonoperated patients who had duodenal ulcer disease and 16 healthy subjects. Gastric emptying of two test meals (a semisolid porridge meal and a solid pancake meal) was measured with a radionuclide technique. The major difference between the BII patients and control subjects and duodenal ulcer patients was an increased rate of emptying of the semisolid meal in the first 5 minutes after meal consumption. The percentage of the meal remaining in the stomach at 5 minutes after completion was significantly less in the symptomatic (45.3% +/- 4.3%) than in the asymptomatic BII patients (79.4% +/- 2.6%). A positive correlation was demonstrated between the initial emptying rate of semisolids and the intensity of postprandial nausea (p less than 0.01), vomiting (p less than 0.05), and vasomotor symptoms (p less than 0.001). The duration of the lag phase for solid and semisolid meals was shorter in BII patients than in healthy subjects but was as short in nonoperated duodenal ulcer patients. The duration of the lag phase for solid food in the BII patients correlated positively with the score for postprandial epigastric pain (p less than 0.001). The rate of emptying of the solid meal was lower in symptomatic BII patients (28.1% +/- 3.6% per hour) than in asymptomatic patients (47.8% +/- 7.2% per hour) and correlated with the severity of postprandial fullness and nausea. The emptying of the solid meal was inversely related to the initial emptying rate of the semisolid meal (p less than 0.05). Therefore, the results of this study support the assumption that many of the postprandial symptoms occurring after BII resection reflect alterations in gastric emptying. Some of the emptying abnormalities present after BII resection may be related to duodenal ulcer disease rather than to the surgical procedure.\r"

The use of a fixed percentage of cardiac output as a measure of extremity flow was not indicative of the measured flow by either capacitance or strain-gauge plethysmography. Capacitance and strain-gauge plethysmography are comparable, noninvasive indicators of change in extremity blood flow in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Although silver sulfadiazine has been used extensively as an effective topical antimicrobial agent in thermal injury patients, little is known about the cutaneous absorption of the silver moiety in these patients. Therefore, we longitudinally evaluated both serum silver concentration and 24-hour urinary excretion of silver in 23 patients with second- and third-degree thermal burns. Mean serum silver concentrations were modestly elevated throughout the patients' hospital course. Urinary excretion of silver was markedly elevated, especially in those patients with more severe burns. Indeed, in patients who had burns covering more than 60% of the total body surface area mean peak silver excretion was 1100 micrograms/24 hr (normal, less than 1 micrograms/24 hr). Thus, silver ion is absorbed across the burn wound in thermal injury patients treated with silver sulfadiazine. The 24-hour urinary excretion of silver appears to be a very sensitive indicator of cutaneous absorption in these patients. Possible implications of this cutaneous silver absorption warrant further evaluation.\r"

  ".U": "87094612\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary dysfunction is a well-recognized complication of burn wound excision. It remains unclear whether this is caused by bacteria or inflammatory mediators released during excision of the wound. We produced a 15% full-thickness burn in 18 sheep, and between days 5 and 7 completely excised the wound under general anesthesia. Pulmonary parameters of static and dynamic lung compliance (CSTAT and CDYN), PaO2/FiO2, and pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) were measured, as well as burn lymph, venous and aortic thromboxane B2 (TxB2), chemotactic index (chemotaxis/chemikinesis), and oxygen radical activity reflected in the level of lipid peroxidation in lung tissue. We noted a transient increase in burn lymph and venous TxB2 during excision, increasing from a preburn value of 200 and 220 +/- 50 pg/ml to 950 +/- 210 and 980 +/- 280 pg/ml, respectively. In 13 of 18 sheep, chemotactic activity and lung tissue lipid peroxidation, measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) content, were not increased. In this group only a very transient decrease in CDYN, PaO2/FiO2, and a 3 mm Hg increase in mean Ppa was seen with excision, with these parameters returning rapidly to baseline. Five of the 13 sheep had wound biopsy specimens that were greater than 10(6) organisms/gm tissue. In the remaining five sheep, plasma chemotactic index was also significantly increased with excision, as was lung MDA content, while decreases in CDYN, CSTAT, and PaO2/FiO2 and an increase in Ppa were more protracted. Three of these five sheep had wound biopsy specimens greater than 10(6) organisms/gm. We conclude that a release of thromboxane occurs during excision, which corresponds in time to transient lung dysfunction. If there is also a release of chemotactic factors, a more protracted pulmonary response occurs with evidence of O2 radical-induced lung changes.\r"

  ".U": "87094613\r", 
  ".W": "We measured ankle systolic blood pressure (ABP) and limb transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) before and after 53 vascular procedures performed to relieve limb-threatening ischemia. We compared changes in ABP and TcPO2 and also compared these measurements of limb hemodynamics with the clinical outcome of the vascular procedures. For the procedures performed on patients without diabetes, both ABP and TcPO2 registered similar changes after surgery. Furthermore, those nondiabetic patients who had a postoperative ABP greater than 75 mm Hg or TcPO2 greater than 20 mm Hg showed resolution of the clinical symptoms within 60 days after surgery. All patients falling below these levels underwent a subsequent limb amputation. The results differed somewhat for procedures performed on patients with diabetes. First, a number of diabetic patients showed high ABP in conjunction with low TcPO2. We attribute these observations to the high incidence in diabetic patients of calcific medial stenosis leading to artificially elevated ABP measurements. Second, the clinical outcome among diabetic patients was uncorrelated with the postoperative ABP and was poorly correlated with postoperative TcPO2. Those diabetic patients with postoperative TcPO2 below 20 mm Hg showed unfavorable clinical outcomes, but many patients with postoperative TcPO2 greater than 20 mm Hg and postoperative ABP greater than 75 mm Hg also showed unfavorable clinical outcome (slow healing of ulcers, persistence of rest pain, and/or an amputation on the limb). These data suggest that among our patients with diabetes, simple relief of limb ischemia was not sufficient to result in a trouble-free clinical course. We conclude that TcPO2 is a useful replacement or adjunct to ABP measurements for evaluating the hemodynamic outcome of vascular surgery. Our results also suggest that it is extremely important to evaluate the outcome of such surgeries separately in patients with and without diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "The effectiveness of chemotherapy is limited by drugs' resistance and toxicity to normal host cells. Verapamil increases the cytotoxicity of the Vinca alkaloids and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin) in tissue culture. In this experiment the effect of verapamil (VER) on the cytotoxicity of vincristine sulfate (VCR) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was studied with the use of an intravenous lung colonization model. After receiving 5 X 10(4) B16 F10 cells intravenously, mice were randomized into six groups and treated with intraperitoneal injections of saline solution, VER, VCR, VCR plus VER, 5-FU, or 5-FU plus VER. In the first experiment, mice were killed on day 22 and lung colonies counted. In subsequent experiments, animals were monitored until death. The addition of VER to VCR significantly decreased pulmonary tumor formation (14 versus 47 colonies; p = 0.05). This was associated with an increase in mean survival from 40.4 to 53.7 days (p = 0.05). Although the addition of VER to 5-FU also decreased pulmonary tumor colony formation (26 versus 73 colonies; p = 0.001), there was no significant prolongation of survival with this treatment. A quantitative clonal culture of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GM-CFC) was used to assess the effect of VER on bone marrow toxicity. The addition of 5 mumol VER to 5-FU (5 X 10(-3) to 5 X 10(-7) mol/L) or VCR (5 X 10(-5) to 5 X 10(-9) mol/L) did not significantly reduce GM-CFC growth compared with treatment with either drug alone. In vivo marrow toxicity assessed 18 hours after a single drug injection was also not increased by the addition of VER to VCR or 5-FU. In this model, VER enhances the oncolytic effect of both VCR and 5-FU without a concomitant increase in toxicity to normal host marrow progenitor cells.\r"

All patients were judged to be in the hyperdynamic phase of the stress response. In both patient groups 27% to 28% of the cardiac index was directed to the splanchnic circulation. However, in sepsis the splanchnic region consumed a significantly larger fraction (p less than 0.05) of the total body oxygen (43.8%) compared with that consumed in injury (30.2%). After injury, the regional splanchnic flow and oxygen consumption appeared to be well matched whereas in sepsis, a disproportionately higher oxygen consumption is found, which must be supplied by increasing blood oxygen extraction. This regional hypermetabolism of the splanchnic area probably results from the increased metabolic demand imposed by the various synthetic processes of this region. In addition, it is proposed that excessive discrepancy between splanchnic flow and oxygen demand may precipitate regional ischemia.\r"

In this investigation, the effects of three inhalation anesthetic agents, halothane, enflurane, and nitrous oxide, on contractile function of the right and left colon were investigated in monkeys. Enflurane and halothane administration caused cessation of contractions in both the left and right colon; suppression of motor activity continued throughout the period of anesthetic administration. Recovery of normal contractile function occurred relatively promptly after cessation of anesthesia with these drugs. Return of normal contractions was more prompt in the right than in the left colon. Administration of nitrous oxide was not associated with significant suppression of contractile function of either the the right or left colon. None of the three agents studied appear to have any role in typical postoperative ileus.\r"

These criteria were used subsequently for making a diagnosis of unstable bladder. Forty per cent of these patients were found to have an unstable bladder. History of frequency and urgency correlated best with a diagnosis in 70 to 80 per cent of our cases, and the new stress cystometrogram proved to be the most sensitive urodynamic test (78%) for detecting this condition.

The existence of a concurrent malignant lesion along with an epidermoid cyst may be more than coincidental. For such an undetected associated lesion, appropriate highly successful adjunctive therapy is delayed if excision of the epidermoid cyst alone is performed. Consequently, inguinal orchiectomy should be the treatment of choice for epidermoid cyst of the testis with the subsequent burden of proof placed on the pathologist to exclude associated lesions that may alter therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The doubling time (DT) of human prostatic cancer is calculated for the first time; its various parameters and the relative importance of each are reviewed. A crude volume-doubling time (DTcv), a theoretical doubling of the number of cells (DTt), and an annual doubling rate (ADR), are defined and calculated for each of 12 patients who had undergone needling of the prostate for diagnostic purposes and in whom tumor cells were implanted in the track of the biopsy needle and had grown into a subcutaneous perineal nodule. The harmonic average DTcv was six days and DTt eight days, and the average ADR was 45 doublings per year. From the study of the calculated DTs and ADRs, it became obvious that the 12 patients fell into three distinct groups: Group I = slow tumor growth rate, an average ADR of 9 doublings per year, and a harmonic average DTt of forty days; Group II = medium tumor growth rate, an average ADR of 35 doublings/year, and a harmonic average DTt of ten days; and Group III = rapid tumor growth rate, an average ADR of 100 doublings/year, and a harmonic average DTt of four days.\r"

  ".W": "In our previous studies, we reported that short-term unilateral spermatic cord torsion had no adverse effect on the germ cells and the Sertoli cell in the contralateral testis of men. As an extension of our earlier investigations on the testicular pathophysiology in humans after unilateral spermatic cord torsion, the present study was undertaken to assess the Leydig cell function employing both fine structural and morphometric analysis in patients with short-term spermatic cord torsion. Bilateral testicular biopsy samples obtained from 4 men (15-19 years) with short-term unilateral torsion of the spermatic cord and from a control group of 6 men (15-40 years) were used in the present investigation. No appreciable difference in the Leydig morphology was noted between the biopsy samples from control and the contralateral testes. This was substantiated by morphometric analysis. The present study clearly indicates that patients with unilateral torsion of the spermatic cord may not essentially have bilateral testicular abnormalities, as suggested by the previous investigators. This report, thus lends further support to our earlier contention that alteration in microcirculation is quite likely the earliest and possibly the most significant contributor to the contralateral testicular damage in man after ipsilateral spermatic cord torsion.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and side effects of flutamide were compared with estramustine in patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma. Thirty patients with metastatic cancers but with no serious cardiovascular (CV) conditions were randomly assigned to receive treatment either with flutamide (250 mg X 3) or with estramustine (280 mg X 2). Clinical examination, bone scan, laboratory measurements, including coagulation studies were performed prior to randomization, every three months during year one, and at six-month intervals thereafter. The two groups were comparable with respect to age and tumor characteristics. However, more patients presented with skeletal pain among those later treated with flutamide. During an observation period of between one and two and one-half years, flutamide was discontinued in 1 case (7%) because of icterus, and estramustine in 3 cases (20%) because of CV complications. Of the remaining 14 flutamide-treated patients, 13 responded initially. Eleven of them relapsed, and 5 died of cancer. In the corresponding group of 12 estramustine-treated patients, there were 11 primary responders. Of these, only 2 relapsed and died as did the only nonresponder. The difference between the two groups with regard to relapse is significant (P less than 0.01), but not with regard to mortality. All estramustine-treated patients lost their libido, whereas only 20 per cent of the patients treated with flutamide did so. In the present limited material there was an initial favorable response to flutamide without signs of CV complications and with maintained libido in most cases. However, due to significantly increased risk for relapse compared with estramustine, flutamide cannot be recommended as single therapy except in cases where estrogens are contraindicated or when interference with libido and potency is unacceptable.\r"

Of the 312 patients, 188 (69%) died during the follow-up, 68% of the deaths having cardiovascular causes. The 10-year relative cumulative survival rate was 0.61 for males and 0.48 for females. The role of smoking as a risk factor could not be analysed without bias. In addition to known risk factors diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease, the degree of peripheral arterial disease itself also proved to be a risk factor among men. The expected life lost for men with intermittent claudication was 20%, but 44.3% for men with advanced lower limb ischaemia (p less than 0.01). This difference could not be explained by the well-known association of advanced ischaemia and diabetes mellitus. The present results therefore suggest that the state of advanced ischaemia indicates larger involvement of the whole of the arterial tree and predicts fatal cardiovascular events among these patients.\r"

In this report the concentrations of serum amyloid A protein (SAA) were measured serially in 6 patients with myocardial infarction and 4 with angina. SAA was found to be increased in all patients with infarction, but in no patients with angina. Significantly increased SAA levels were detected 12 hours after the peak level of creatine kinase, and the concentrations of SAA seemed to correlate to the amount of damaged tissue. The SAA-response was both faster and more extensive than the response of C-reactive protein (CRP), but the correlation between SAA and CRP was very good.\r"

Thirty patients underwent a second set of samples six months after the first one, 23 of whom had a reduction of their muscle potassium content relative to the first biopsy. They simultaneously demonstrated a significant impairment of glucose tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of hyperglycaemia and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus was assessed in 214 consecutive patients admitted to the coronary care units with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). On admission, 16 patients (7.5%) had known diabetes, and 19 patients, not previously known to be diabetic, had blood glucose concentrations of greater than or equal to 9 mmol/l. Fifteen patients survived for 2 months at which time a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test showed diabetes in 9 (60%) and impaired glucose tolerance in 4 (27%). Ten of these 13 patients (77%) with abnormal glucose tolerance had elevated glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) on admission, indicating pre-existing glucose intolerance or diabetes. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 4.5% (9/198). However, we may have overlooked undiagnosed diabetes in a small number of patients on admission, since only a random blood glucose less than 8 mmol/l rules out diabetes, WHO criteria. Elevated blood glucose in patients with AMI is more likely to reflect a stationary pre-existing abnormal glucose tolerance than a temporary stress-induced phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "At a follow-up 7-10 years after a health screening of 50-year-old men in Uppsala, 101 of the 2322 participants and 51 of the 446 non-participants had died. The incidence was thus almost three times as high among non-participants as among participants. Registration at the Temperance Board and/or the Bureau of Social Services was 2-3 times more common among the deceased subjects than among the living irrespective of participation in the health screening. A multiple logistic analysis revealed that non-participation and both types of registration were associated with an increased risk of death. For death from neoplasm only registration at the Bureau of Social Services, and not that at the Temperance Board, was a risk factor. For ischaemic heart disease (IHD), on the other hand, registration at the Temperance Board was the strongest risk factor, the other type of registration being secondary, and non-participation in the screening was a non-significant risk factor. The importance of alcohol intemperance as a risk factor for IHD was reflected in the fact that every second subject dying a sudden death (classified as IHD death) was registered at the Temperance Board. These results indicate that alcohol intemperance entails an increased risk of developing fatal complications to IHD, and social disability may carry with it a risk of both neoplasm and, to a lesser extent, death from IHD.\r"
