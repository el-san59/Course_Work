  ".W": "This study was designed to determine in patients with unstable angina whether specific electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with ischemia, the presence of coronary lesions consistent with thrombosis on angiography or the presence of recurrent ischemia reflects increases in thrombin activity as manifested by increased plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A. The concentration of fibrinopeptide A in plasma was increased to 6.7 +/- 3.1 nM for the group as a whole (n = 29). Increases were greater in the 17 patients who exhibited reversible ST segment shifts (10.2 +/- 5.2 nM) than in the 12 patients exhibiting reversible T wave abnormalities alone (1.6 +/- 0.2 nM) (p less than 0.01). Nine of the 17 patients with reversible ST segment shifts who underwent coronary angiography had lesions with morphologic characteristics consistent with atherosclerotic plaque complicated by thrombosis compared with only 2 of 9 patients with T wave changes only (p less than 0.05). Plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A were markedly elevated in 7 of the 11 patients in whom complex lesions were noted on angiographic examination. Thus, the occurrence of reversible ST segment shifts identifies a group of patients with unstable angina in whom ongoing thrombosis is likely and who may be particularly likely to benefit from antithrombotic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 239 patients undergoing serial coronary angiography with a concomitant ergonovine provocation test were studied between July 1974 and June 1987. The progression of coronary artery disease was evaluated in relation to risk factors, especially coronary artery spasm. Patients were classified into three groups: 1) new myocardial infarction group (39 patients); 2) progression without infarction group (90 patients); and 3) nonprogression group (110 patients). To assess how risk factors and coronary spasm are related to the occurrence of new myocardial infarction and progression without infarction, 11 variables in the three groups were examined: age, gender, the time interval between the studies, fasting blood sugar, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, smoking, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test. Multiple regression analysis selected three independent predictors of progression without infarction: cholesterol (p less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test (p less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis also selected three independent predictors of the occurrence of new myocardial infarction: fasting blood sugar (p less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test (p less than 0.001). A positive response to the ergonovine provocation test was the strongest factor for occurrence of both new myocardial infarction and progression without infarction. To evaluate segmental arterial changes, 3,275 coronary artery segments were analyzed in the 239 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Reperfusion may limit the amount of potentially salvageable myocardium through the introduction of cellular elements into previously ischemic but viable myocardium (reperfusion injury). It has been demonstrated that intracoronary infusion of a 20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion (Fluosol) significantly reduces infarct size and results in improved left ventricular function in the canine model. This pilot study was performed to explore the existence of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans. Utilizing Fluosol as a probe in conjunction with emergency coronary angioplasty, 26 patients presenting within 4 h with a first anterior myocardial infarction were randomized to emergency angioplasty or angioplasty followed by a 30-min intracoronary infusion of Fluosol at 40 ml/min. Global and regional ventricular function were assessed immediately and a mean of 12 days after successful angioplasty with contrast ventriculography. Infarct size was semiquantitated with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images before discharge. Twelve patients (six undergoing angioplasty alone, six treated with angioplasty and Fluosol) had an occluded infarct-related vessel (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 0 to 1) at the time of emergency catheterization and were included in the final analysis. At 12 days after successful angioplasty, the improvement in regional ventricular function was greater in patients receiving adjunctive therapy with intracoronary Fluosol versus those undergoing angioplasty alone utilizing both the radial shortening and centerline method, respectively (23 +/- 3.1% vs. 8 +/- 2.3%, p less than 0.02; and -1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. -2.9 +/- 0.2 SD/chord, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As the waiting lists lengthen, priority is awarded solely on the basis of the waiting time of outpatients, who now usually undergo transplantation after they have already survived a major period of jeopardy. To determine the impact of the current waiting times and priority system on the previously expected benefit offered by transplantation, 1-year actuarial survival without transplantation was recalculated after each month without transplantation for 214 potential candidates with an ejection fraction of 0.17 +/- 0.05 discharged on tailored medical therapy after evaluation. These data were compared with the 1-year survival data of 88 outpatients who underwent transplantation. Actuarial survival after 1 year was 67% on tailored therapy compared with 88% after transplantation (p = 0.009). Death without transplantation was sudden in 43 of 51 patients, resulting from hemodynamic decompensation in 8. For outpatients already surviving 6 months without transplantation, actuarial survival over the next 12 months was 83% without transplantation. Thus, the expected improvement in survival after transplantation would be only 5% over the subsequent year for patients waiting 6 months, which is the waiting time for many outpatients. Such patients should be reevaluated to determine whether transplantation remains indicated during the next year.\r"

Fasting cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 and lipoprotein(a) were evaluated in 69 consecutive patients during the waiting period before cardiac transplantation. There were 28 deaths before donor organ identification and 41 patients received a cardiac allograft. The lipoprotein levels of transplant recipients were again assayed 3 months postoperatively. Mean (+/- SEM) values increased for total plasma cholesterol (from 180 +/- 8 to 228 +/- 8 mg/dl, p less than or equal to 0.001), triglycerides (from 126 +/- 11 to 207 +/- 14 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.001), HDL cholesterol (from 39 +/- 2 to 49 +/- 3 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.002) and LDL cholesterol (from 119 +/- 7 to 138 +/- 7 mg/dl; p less than 0.02). Apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 also increased, but lipoprotein(a) decreased from 11.7 +/- 1.7 to 6.8 +/- 1.1 mg/dl; p less than or equal to 0.0001) after transplantation. Although total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-1 and B-100 increased dramatically after cardiac transplantation, so did HDL cholesterol, thereby keeping the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio constant. The surprising decrease in lipoprotein(a) after cardiac transplantation suggests that metabolism of lipoprotein(a) is independent of LDL cholesterol and that immunosuppressive drugs either decrease the synthesis or increase catabolism of lipoprotein(a).\r"

All patients had an increased level of serum anticardiolipin antibodies with no evidence of malignancy or systemic lupus erythematosus. The clinical manifestations of primary antiphospholipid syndrome were arterial thrombosis in 14 patients, venous thrombosis in 6 and recurrent fetal loss in 14. Valvular lesions were observed on two-dimensional echocardiography in 11 patients (32%) (9 women and 2 men), aged 24 to 57 years (mean +/- 1 SD 36 +/- 10). Abnormal echocardiographic findings were observed in 9 (64%) of 14 patients with arterial thrombosis versus 1 (17%) of 6 patients with venous thrombosis and 1 (7%) of 14 patients with recurrent fetal loss. The most common echocardiographic abnormality was mitral leaflet thickening, found in five patients; this was associated with mitral regurgitation in three and with combined mild mitral stenosis and regurgitation in one patient. Localized subvalvular mitral thickening was observed in one patient and calcification of the anulus in another. Aortic valve thickening was observed in two patients, one of whom also had a moderate degree of aortic regurgitation. Vegetation-like lesions on the mitral or aortic valve were found in two patients. It is concluded that valvular lesions are commonly found in primary antiphospholipid syndrome, particularly when the syndrome is manifested by peripheral arterial thrombosis. The location and appearance of valvular lesions in this syndrome are heterogeneous. Most patients have no clinically significant valvular disease. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic studies are often informative in these patients.\r"

The mean patient age was 38 +/- 8 years. Pulmonary involvement was apparent in three patients and no systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis were present in one patient. All patients had electrocardiographic abnormalities at rest and six had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%. All seven patients had left ventricular wall motion abnormalities and five had mitral valve dysfunction. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was easily induced in all patients. Spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia was not prevented with corticosteroid administration. Despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy, two patients had sudden cardiac death and an additional four had recurrence of ventricular tachycardia. Four patients had an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator implanted and received drug therapy; all four received appropriate shocks. This report represents the largest descriptive series of consecutive patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with sarcoidosis. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy of ventricular tachycardia in patients with sarcoidosis, even when guided with programmed ventricular stimulation, is associated with a high rate of arrhythmia recurrence or sudden death, or both. Thus, implantation of an automatic antitachycardia device (cardioverter-defibrillator) should be considered as primary therapy in such patients. Furthermore, sarcoidosis should be excluded, with Kveim skin testing if necessary, in any patient with sustained ventricular tachycardia of unknown origin.\r"

In part 2 of the study, visual interpretation of percent diameter stenosis from 212 stenoses on 241 arteriograms was compared with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment. The visual analysis overestimated disease severity in arteries with greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis (except for right coronary lesions) and underestimated severity in all arteries with less than 50% diameter stenosis. Of the 241 arteriograms, 40 had quantitative and visual analysis of all three coronary arteries for assessment of significant disease. In only 62% of the cases did visual and quantitative methods agree on the presence of severe disease; visual estimates diagnosed significantly (p less than 0.05) more three-vessel disease. In part 3 of the study, comparison of percent diameter stenosis by visual estimate with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment before and after balloon angioplasty of 38 stenoses showed that visual interpretation significantly (p less than 0.001) overestimated initial lesion severity and underestimated stenosis severity after angioplasty.\r"

This imaging method has been validated with in vitro systems and in peripheral vessels, but there are few in vivo coronary artery studies. Twenty cardiac transplant recipients with no angiographic coronary artery disease were scanned with a 30-MHz intravascular ultrasound catheter from the left main coronary ostium to the mid-left anterior descending coronary artery. Simultaneous angiographic measurements were performed at 76 sites. Ultrasound end-diastolic diameters in two perpendicular axes were 3.8 +/- 0.9 and 3.9 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively, and mean diameter derived from an area determined by planimetry was 3.9 +/- 0.9 mm. Angiographic coronary artery diameters measured with a computer-assisted edge detection system perpendicular to the long axis of the vessel and to the long axis of the catheter were 3.4 +/- 0.8 and 3.6 +/- 0.8 mm, respectively. Luminal diameters measured with the two imaging systems correlated closely, with an r value of 0.86 when ultrasound was compared with the angiographic diameter measured perpendicular to the vessel and 0.88 when compared with the angiographic diameter measured perpendicular to the imaging catheter. Eighty-three percent of the ultrasound-measured diameters were above the line of identity when compared with the simultaneous angiographic measurement. The more the imaging catheter deviated from the long axis of the vessel, the greater was the discrepancy between the ultrasound and angiographic measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate the potential of NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary stenosis in patients with chest pain, ultrafast NMR imaging in conjunction with a T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) contrast agent was performed in 17 patients with chest pain who had undergone cardiac catheterization. These included 12 patients with significant coronary artery stenoses and 4 who underwent repeat NMR study after myocardial revascularization. Cardiac images at rest were obtained during rapid intravenous injection of gadolinium-DTPA (0.04 mM/kg). Electrocardiographic-gated images were acquired over 380 ms, with repetitive images obtained every 3 to 4 s. After contrast injection, there was pronounced signal enhancement in the right ventricular cavity, followed by enhancement in the left ventricular cavity and myocardium. Regional myocardium perfused by a diseased vessel demonstrated a lower peak signal intensity (p = 0.001) and lower rate of signal increase (p = 0.001) than did myocardium perfused by coronary arteries without stenosis. Repeat NMR study after revascularization showed an increase in peak signal intensity (p less than 0.002). These results demonstrate the clinical potential of dynamic gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain. In combination with anatomic and functional NMR imaging, this technique has the potential to provide a comprehensive noninvasive cardiac evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.\r"

To examine the effects of coronary angioplasty on 13 asynergic vascular territories in 12 patients, positron emission tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed before and within 72 h of revascularization. Ten patients underwent late echocardiography (67 +/- 19 days) and eight underwent a late positron emission tomographic study (68 +/- 19 days). The extent and severity of abnormalities of wall motion, perfusion and glucose metabolism were expressed as wall motion scores, perfusion defect scores and perfusion-metabolism mismatch scores. Angioplasty significantly increased mean stenosis cross-sectional area (from 0.95 +/- 0.9 to 2.7 +/- 1.4 mm2) and mean cross-sectional luminal diameter (from 0.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 mm) (both p less than 0.001). Perfusion defect scores in dependent vascular territories improved early after angioplasty (from 116 +/- 166 to 31 +/- 51, p less than 0.002) with no further improvement on the late follow-up study. The mean perfusion-metabolism mismatch score decreased from 159 +/- 175 to 65 +/- 117 early after angioplasty (p less than 0.01) and to 26 +/- 29 at late follow-up (p less than 0.001 vs. before angioplasty; p = NS vs. early after angioplasty).

Before valvuloplasty, the patient series were comparable with regard to average age, gender repartition and most clinical, electrocardiographic, X-ray and hemodynamic variables. Poor anatomic forms of mitral stenosis were equally distributed in both series (41% vs. 45%, p = NS). The magnitude of mitral valve area increase and of mean mitral gradient decrease during percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty did not differ significantly in the Inoue balloon and double-balloon series (mean +/- SEM 1.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.95 +/- 0.5 and 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.97 +/- 0.5 cm2, respectively, for mitral valve area and 12 +/- 3 to 5 +/- 2 and 13 +/- 4 to 5 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, for mean mitral gradient). Four cases of 3+ mitral regurgitation occurred in the Inoue balloon series and 7 in the double-balloon series (p = NS). A good immediate result--defined as mitral valve area greater than or equal to 1.5 cm2 with greater than or equal to 25% in mitral valve area gain and mitral regurgitation less than 2+ at the end of the procedure--was observed in 78% of patients in both series.

  ".W": "Ultrafast computed tomography has been reported to be an accurate method of measuring left ventricular mass in dogs. To assess the interstudy, intraobserver and interobserver variability of left ventricular myocardial mass measurements in humans, left ventricular myocardial volume was measured three times within 24 h in 16 patients with ischemic heart disease. The mean percent difference of the mean of the three studies performed was -0.01 +/- 1.4% (range -2.9% to 3.6%). The regression analysis for the intraobserver variability at baseline was: Y = -4.33 + 1.03X; r = 0.99, SEE = 3.5 ml. The mean percent difference of the mean of the two sets of measurements performed by two independent observers was 0.28 +/- 2.1% (range -4.35% to 4.35%). The interobserver variability excluding papillary muscles at baseline study was: Y = -4.34 + 1.06X; r = 0.99, SEE = 1.5 ml. The regression analysis with versus without papillary muscles showed: Y = -8.72 + 0.97X; r = 0.96, SEE = 2.6 ml. Regression analysis to assess the variability of 24-h studies at end-systole versus end-diastole revealed: Y = 3.07 + 0.94X; r = 0.97, SEE = 1.8 ml. In conclusion, ultrafast computed tomography is a minimally invasive technique, with very low interstudy, intraobserver and interobserver variability for left ventricular myocardial volume and mass determinations in serial studies.\r"

  ".W": "The flow of a saline-glycerin solution with sand particles through a continuous in vitro flow system was imaged by using two commercially available Doppler color flow mapping systems in a power mode (Toshiba SSH-160A and Advanced Technology Laboratories [ATL] Ultramark 9). The images generated from seven solutions with particle concentrations ranging from 0.0001 x 10(12) to 6 x 10(12) particles/liter and a mean velocity of 30 cm/s measured with use of pulsed Doppler ultrasound were used to examine the dependence of the power mode on particle concentration. To examine the velocity dependence, 20 mean velocities ranging from 0.1 to 0.53 m/s (3 to 30 liters/min) and three particle concentrations (1, 3 and 6 x 10(12) particles/liter) in the solution were used. The recorded images were digitized and analyzed off-line. The SUM values, or the adjusted color intensity levels in delineated areas of interest in the displayed flow, were compared. In general, the power mode was sensitive in displaying slower velocity flows; in the selected particle concentration and velocity ranges, it was both velocity and concentration dependent. The specific dependence differed for the two color flow mapping systems.\r"

  ".W": "In 1988, Arizona's 61 hospitals providing obstetrical services were canvased with regard to hospital routines that favor either breast-feeding or bottle-feeding. Forty-five hospitals provided responses that were used in the survey. Practices favoring breast-feeding, which were reported by a majority of the hospitals (more than 50%), were demand feeding, staff assessment for \"latch-on\" (the action of nipple presentation and sucking initiation) and positioning, \"rooming-in\" (the practice of minimal mother-infant separation), and information about follow-up support services. Hospital practices suggested to promote bottle-feeding were the provision of pacifiers and supplemental water or glucose, issuance of formula packs at discharge, and a first feed of sterile water. A positive significant relationship was identified for policies advocating breast-feeding and the prevalence of breast-feeding encouragement from professional staff. Of 44 respondents, 41 indicated that their hospital's policies endorse breast-feeding as the ideal method of feeding healthy newborns. Hospital staff perceived that they encourage mothers to breast-feed and offer support to those who initiate breast-feeding. On the basis of this information, we conclude that dietetics practitioners should evaluate current breast-feeding practices and integrate policies supportive of breast-feeding into the health care system.\r"

Continuing education approved for maintenance of professional registration by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) and continuing education not applicable for registration status (non-CDR) were studied. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 484 registered dietitians from the northeast United States who had been employed in health care institutions for 3 years or more. A response rate of 40% was obtained. The investigation showed a significantly greater perceived improvement in practice from non-CDR continuing education over a 3-year period than from CDR-approved continuing education. Respondents obtaining less than 30 hours of non-CDR and CDR continuing education over a 3-year period derived a significantly smaller perceived improvement in practice than did respondents obtaining more than 30 hours. Personal standards were used to the greatest extent (87%), followed by standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (68%), to measure quality practice. This study indicates that practitioners focusing on improving their practice will want to consider the contributions of informal work-related activities as well as CDR-approved continuing education.\r"

It surveyed 5,000 RDs and DTRs to determine current and preferred continuing education activities, factors influencing the selection of activities, topics most likely to be selected, and demographic characteristics. Results show that RDs and DTRs use a variety of mechanisms and pursue a large number of topics. Continuing education needs are most often met through locally available activities. Preferred mechanisms are workshops and lectures. ADA and state/district associations are major, but not exclusive, providers of programming. Practitioners tend to choose topics related to their practice area. Topics requested at an advanced level of presentation related to traditional dietetic practice; topics requested at a basic level were new or not specific to nutrition. The data will be incorporated into the ADA continuing education programming plan and will provide direction for ADA's exploration of new methods of continuing education delivery.\r"

Our study sought to develop a more time-efficient method of assessing short-term intake by developing a 7-day food frequency questionnaire (7DFFQ). We modified Willett's 1-year food frequency questionnaire to assess intake for a 7-day period. Content validity has previously been exhibited in Willett's work. We assessed criterion validity by comparing the 7DFFQ with 24-hour recalls. Twenty-one female and 20 male college students were asked to recall their previous day's intake three times during a 1-week period. After the last recall, subjects completed a 7DFFQ covering the same week. Data were analyzed by comparing each recall and the mean of the three recalls with values obtained on the 7DFFQ. Analyses revealed high correlations between the mean of the three recalls and the 7DFFQ. Further analysis ranked subjects into quartiles for each nutrient on both measures. Most subjects changed either no quartiles or only one quartile for total energy and each nutrient. Test/retest reliability was assessed by administering the 7DFFQ to a group of women for two consecutive weeks and by administering the 7DFFQ to a group twice 3 hours apart. Pearson's r and intraclass correlations for the two administrations show moderately high reliability over the 1-week period and considerable improvement with the 3-hour administration. The 7DFFQ appears to meet several of the criteria for a measure of dietary intake.\r"

To gather information about recruitment strategies and to identify recruitment techniques perceived to be successful, we surveyed 258 program directors of approved Plan IV and V programs listed in the 1989 Directory of Dietetic Programs. One hundred thirty-nine questionnaires were completed, a response rate of 55%. On-campus students were recruited primarily from general education or basic nutrition classes or by means of written information placed in campus offices. High school, community college, and junior high school students were usually contacted through career information days, although high school students were contacted more frequently than were community college or junior high school students. Almost half of the respondents made a special effort to recruit underrepresented groups. A variety of strategies had a significant positive relationship with perceived recruitment success. Some involved personal contact-for example, meeting with high school science and home economics teachers, attending career information days at community colleges, and having a full-time faculty member assigned to meet with prospective majors. Other strategies involved the development of printed materials and displays. Department or school names that were directly related to nutrition, dietetics, health, science, or professional management were perceived as having a positive effect on promoting the dietetics program. Recruitment strategies perceived to be successful may be a useful starting point for recruitment efforts. The findings indicate recruiting strategies can be categorized into two groups--those that involve personal contact and those that involve the use and development of the print and graphic media.\r"

We compared the results of this study with those of an earlier survey of dietetic internship directors. The AP4 and dietetic internship directors gave significantly different importance ratings to elective courses in professional sciences and courses in the biological/physical sciences. Unlike dietetic internship directors, AP4 directors rated Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score highest (1.4 +/- 1.7 on a 10-point scale). AP4 directors' rating of grade point average (1.8 +/- 1.3) and professional courses (1.9 +/- 1.2) was similar to the internship directors' rating of these criteria (1.7 +/- 0.9 and 1.7 +/- 1.0, respectively). Results indicate that AP4 and internship directors seek similar qualities in students, but that GRE score is more important to AP4 directors. The AP4 directors' emphasis on GRE score may be explained, in part, by the fact that 76% (38 of 50) of these programs are affiliated with a university program, and of those 38 programs, 29 (88%) require graduate credit as a component of the AP4. These data are important to Plan IV/V faculty advisers because students may have misconceptions about differences in AP4 and internship selection criteria.\r"

Using a seven-point scale, we addressed this question with 341 preschool children and 421 of their parents participating in a longitudinal study of childhood behaviors in San Diego County, California. Milk type and cooking fat reported in the fat-avoidance scale was compared with data reported in a 24-hour food intake record. An overall 86% agreement for milk type and a 78% agreement for cooking fat were noted. Anglo preschoolers (n = 143) had significantly greater mean scores for fat and cholesterol avoidance than did Mexican-American preschoolers (n = 198). Anglo, but not Mexican-American, women avoided fat and cholesterol more often than did their male counterparts. A significantly higher sum score was noted for Anglo men and women and Mexican-American men as education increased. These findings indicate that the fat-avoidance scale has a relative validity compared with a 1-day food record, that fat avoidance can be measured, that differences can be noted in a biethnic sample of children and adults, and that the scale has potential for monitoring success in achieving a lower fat and cholesterol intake.\r"

However, planning and consuming a diet that contains 60% to 70% carbohydrate is difficult for most athletes. To develop a simple carbohydrate monitoring tool for athletes, we analyzed three sets of 3-day diet records from 17 male endurance runners over a 10-week competitive period and 9 female endurance runners over a 9-week training period. We then developed a simple carbohydrate monitoring tool. To validate the instrument, we compared each athlete's carbohydrate intake as estimated using the instrument with the athlete's actual carbohydrate intake from the 3-day diet records. Mean estimated percents of energy from carbohydrate using the carbohydrate monitoring tool were not significantly different from the actual mean carbohydrate intakes. Examination of individual diets showed that the estimated carbohydrate was always within 2% of the actual carbohydrate. Therefore, the instrument did a good job of estimating the percent of energy from carbohydrate in the diets of endurance runners. This instrument will provide a quick method by which the athlete can assess and improve carbohydrate intake on a daily basis without the use of daily diet records.\r"

High school and community college students were recruited using a slide/tape presentation featuring black and Hispanic professionals. In addition, the college offered a summer course entitled \"Perspectives of the Health Sciences Professions\" to students entering their senior year in high school. In this course, students learned how dietitians, medical laboratory scientists, and physical and occupational therapists treat various disease states. Field trips and site visits provided additional exposure to the professions. A summer orientation and tutorial program was established to retain minority students enrolled in the coordinated undergraduate program. We recommend that this program be considered as a model for dietetics educators to use in developing other programs to increase the number of minorities in the profession.\r"

Most persons were diagnosed through mandatory HIV testing in the USAF and were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.

  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Western blot is indeterminate in 10%-20% of sera reactive by EIA. Eighty-nine individuals with prior repeatedly reactive EIA and indeterminate Western blots were followed prospectively to study the risk of seroconversion and specificity of supplemental tests. Four high-risk cases seroconverted within 10 months after enrollment (seroconversion risk, 4.5%, 95% confidence interval, 1.2%-11.1%). Among cases with p24 bands initially, 4 (18.2%) of 22 high-risk individuals seroconverted compared with 0 of 33 low-risk cases (P = .03). Specificities of HIV-1 culture, serum p24 antigen, polymerase chain reaction, and recombinant ENV 9 EIA were 100%, 100%, 98.6%, and 94.4%, respectively. An expedited evaluation protocol is proposed. Low-risk individuals with nonreactive EIAs upon repeat testing do not need further follow-up; high-risk individuals should be followed serologically for at least 6 months, especially those with p24 bands on Western blot.\r"

Among patients receiving placebo, times to crusting (P = .043), cessation of investigator-observed signs (P = .005), lesion-associated signs (P = .02), and groin signs (P = .05) were longer in women.

Stool specimens from this prospective study were screened for both astrovirus and adenovirus hexon with two new indirect double-antibody assays and for enteric adenoviruses with an EIA specific for serotypes 40 and 41. Astrovirus was detected in a significantly greater percentage of children with diarrhea (4%, 21/524) than of those without (less than 1%, 1/138) (P less than .05); however, no difference between such such children with adenovirus infections was found (8%, 43/565, and 8%, 10/129, respectively). Overall, 30% (13/43) of all adenovirus hexon-positive specimens were enteric serotypes, and by extrapolation, enteric adenoviruses were identified in an equal percentage of children (2%) with and without diarrhea. This study documents the presence of astrovirus and enteric adenoviruses among children in day care in the United States, associates astrovirus with diarrhea in this setting, and suggests that viral agents may be the most common enteric pathogens among children with diarrhea in day care.\r"

At 33.5 months after infection, 8 of 12 seropositive goats had CAEV-63-specific neutralizing antibody. Five neutralization-positive goats developed clinically apparent arthritis of carpal joints, three of which had periarticular swelling indicating severe synovitis. Arthritis was not evident in age-matched controls or infected goats without neutralizing antibody. Multiple viral isolates were obtained from synovial fluid or synovial fluid cells of arthritic joints between 36.4 and 44.9 months after infection, and successive isolates from individual joints were defined as antigenic variants expressing type-specific neutralization epitopes. Thus, the evolution of neutralizing antibody does not arrest viral replication or development of progressive inflammatory lesions. Rather, some antigenic variants produced in the presence of neutralizing antibody are clonally expanded within carpal joints, and severe joint inflammation is specifically associated with these variants.\r"

A plasmid-mediated EPEC adherence factor (EAF) is responsible for initial and localized adherence. A chromosomally encoded E. coli attachment and effacement factor (eae) is involved in effacement of the eukaryotic cell surface and characteristic \"pedestal\" formation. By using isogenic strains deficient in either EAF, eae, or both, the process of EPEC adherence and entry in vitro was examined. While EAF proved necessary and sufficient for efficient bacterial association with HEp-2 cells, both EAF and eae were required for efficient effacement of and entry into these cells and other cultured cell lines. Invasion mediated by eae was markedly inhibited by cytochalasin D and colchicine. Afimbrial adhesion or type I pili from uropathogenic strains of E. coli substituted for EAF in EAF-Eae+ strains to provide initial adherence to HEp-2 cells and to facilitate actin condensation.\r"

In October 1985, the Wisconsin Division of Health investigated an outbreak of pertussis in residents of a nursing home in rural Wisconsin. Clinical information and nasopharyngeal swab and acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens were obtained from all consenting residents and employees. Of 105 residents, 38 (36.2%) were seropositive, including four who were culture-positive for Bordetella pertussis. Culture-positive residents (age range, 52-81 years) had cough lasting 43-54 days. Three of these residents had paroxysmal cough, and all four had cough that interrupted sleep; none of the residents had cough with apnea or vomiting, and all recovered without sequelae. Of six seropositive residents with clinical pertussis, five lived on the south wing of the facility. Of 104 employees, 8 (7.7%) were seropositive, but none were culture-positive for B. pertussis. The higher attack rate for residents and the clustering of clinical cases were consistent with ongoing transmission within the nursing home.\r"

To investigate its pathogenesis, the cytotoxic effects of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) on porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) were examined in vitro. TSST-1 killed PAEC (as measured by 51Cr release) in a dose- and time-dependent fashion and was blocked by anti-TSST-1 antibodies. Receptor-mediated endocytosis may be critical for the cytotoxic effects of TSST-1, as killing was inhibited by cold (4 degrees C) and by addition of chloroquine and methylamine. Furthermore, calcium and oxygen appeared necessary for TSST-1 effects on PAEC. Membrane receptor binding studies indicated PAEC bind TSST-1 with high affinity (Kd = 5.7 x 10(-7) M) and had 2.2 x 10(4) receptors/cell. Last, as measured by 125I-labeled albumin flux in a transendothelial permeability model, TSST-1 enhanced the permeability of PAEC monolayers in a dose- and time-dependent manner.\r"

The medical records of all patients diagnosed with ARF in Miami-Dade County, Florida, between 1984 and 1988 were reviewed. Thirty-five cases met the revised Jones criteria and were considered definite; four additional cases were classified as probable. Carditis was present in 54%. Of the 39 patients, 32 (82%) were black. The annual incidence of ARF among black children aged 5-14 years was 12.25 per 100,000 compared to 0.71 for other (non-Hispanic white plus Hispanic) children (P less than .001). ARF was centered in the inner city, where the incidence among black children reached 15.21. Despite the multiethnic, multiracial character of Miami-Dade County and the rapid influx of immigrants, ARF in this community remains primarily a disease of underprivileged, black inner-city children.\r"

Of 102 patients with fungemia, 45% had candidemia alone with a mortality of 39%. Mortality in patients with tissue involvement was 90% with or without fungemia. Factors that increased infection were age, acute graft-versus-host disease, and donor mismatch. Factors that decreased infection included conditioning with 12 Gy of fractionated irradiation and cyclophosphamide, transplantation for aplastic anemia, and more rapid engraftment. Among fungemic patients, the number of days of fungemia was a risk factor for tissue invasion while more rapid engraftment was protective.\r"

Parasite numbers per villus of retrovirally infected mice were 20-fold higher than in controls, which showed only occasional parasites. Feces from most virally infected mice but none from controls contained oocysts. Cryptosporidium infection in mice after 4 and 5 months of retroviral infection was accompanied by severe immunosuppression and parasite levels 50-5000 times higher than in controls. A high level of infection persisted 21 days after Cryptosporidium challenge in virally infected mice, while controls cleared their transient and marginal infection. These results further characterize LP-BM5 infection as a murine model of retrovirally induced acquired immune deficiency.\r"

HSV type 2 was cultured from three of four episodes and the mean duration of viral isolation from recurrent genital lesions was 2.6 days. PCR detected HSV DNA from lesion swabs during all four episodes, and HSV DNA was positive for an average of 6.8 days. HSV DNA was demonstrated in ulcerative lesions on 15 of 17 days versus 3 of 17 days by viral isolation (P less than .01). HSV PCR became negative when the lesions reepithelialized.

Antibody responses were significantly higher for asymptomatic persons (aggregate geometric mean, 972 ng of antibody nitrogen (AbN)/ml; P less than .001) and AIDS/ARC patients receiving a median of 12 weeks (range, 4-54) of zidovudine therapy (mean, 369 ng of AbN/ml; P less than .001) when compared with untreated AIDS/ARC patients. Antibody responses among zidovudine-treated AIDS/ARC patients were independent of the dose (mean, 629.2 mg/day; range, 100-1200 mg) or duration of zidovudine therapy. For zidovudine-treated AIDS/ARC patients, persistence of an aggregate antibody response 8 months after vaccination was associated with survival at 14 months after vaccination, whereas waning of response was not. Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered as early as possible in the course of HIV infection. Immunization should be delayed for at least 4 weeks for AIDS/ARC patients initiating zidovudine therapy.\r"

Extracts of PBMC were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Eluted AZT mono- (MP), di- (DP), and triphosphate (TP) were collected in separate portions. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase yielded equimolar amounts of AZT, which after solid-phase enrichment were assayed by radioimmunoassay. Detection limit was 0.1 pmol/10(6) PBMC for each nucleotide. Recoveries of 102%-118% were observed. AZT nucleotides were measured in samples from three patients receiving 250 mg of AZT every 12 h. Intracellular concentrations of AZT-MP after 1-2 h ranged from 0.9 to 1.4 pmol/10(6) PBMC and then declined to 0.3-1.1 pmol/10(6) PBMC after 4 h. AZT-DP and AZT-TP reached concentrations of 0.3-0.5 pmol/10(6) PBMC after 1-2 h and could not be detected after 4 h in any of the three patients.

Between July 1989 and July 1990, 12 men with AIDS, cytomegalovirus retinitis, and salvageable vision received intravenous acyclovir, 10 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h, and oral zidovudine after successful induction therapy with intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg every 12 h for 14 days. Patients were evaluated weekly. Ten of 12 patients were followed to the time of retinitis progression; two were withdrawn from the study because of concomitant life-threatening infection. The median duration of acyclovir and zidovudine therapy before retinitis progression occurred was 32 days. None of the eight uninvolved eyes in the 10 evaluatable patients developed cytomegalovirus retinitis during study participation. These data suggest that high-dose intravenous acyclovir with zidovudine provides some benefit in suppressing cytomegalovirus retinitis.\r"

Preexisting foscarnet-resistant mutants could not be detected in a stock of wild-type strain AD169 at frequencies greater than 0.0025%. However, foscarnet-resistant mutants could be isolated by passage in increasing drug concentrations. Two independent mutants were shown by plaque reduction and dot-blot hybridization assays to be resistant to phosphonoacetic acid and acyclovir, sensitive to ganciclovir, vidarabine, 2'fluoro-5-iodoarabinosylcytosine, and (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2- phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine; and hypersensitive to aphidicolin and (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine. These results have implications for the mutation frequency of CMV, for the possibility that clinically important foscarnet- and acyclovir-resistant CMV infections could emerge, for possible therapies of drug-resistant virus infections, and for the role of viral DNA polymerase in mechanisms of selective action of anti-CMV drugs.\r"

However, it has not been readily available to AIDS patients with renal insufficiency because its major side effect is nephrotoxicity. In this report, the efficacy, safety, and dosing requirements of foscarnet in a hemodialysis-dependent patient with CMV retinitis are presented. Foscarnet was administered for 14 weeks, at an initial dosage of 60 mg/kg after each dialysis session. Plasma concentrations were monitored weekly, and the dosage was adjusted to maintain peak plasma levels in the range of 500-800 microM. Although some laboratory abnormalities occurred (a preexisting anemia continued, serum calcium and phosphorus decreased, and ionized calcium increased), they did not limit therapy. Foscarnet is a potentially useful alternative treatment for CMV retinitis in hemodialysis-dependent AIDS patients.\r"

In adults, neutralizing antibody rises to strain M37 and the related serotype 1 strain Wa occurred with equal frequency (41% vs. 47%). In pediatric subjects, the former were more frequent (36%-40%) than the latter (10%-18%). This was also true of 8 infants who received two doses of vaccine. Mild gastrointestinal illnesses occurred with equal frequency in pediatric subjects who received vaccine or placebo. Thus, strain M37 was well tolerated and immunogenic in young infants, but elicited primarily vaccine-strain-specific rather than serotype-specific neutralizing antibody responses.\r"

Optimal conditions of production and release of LTs were defined using CBIB. LT release was enhanced when E. coli cells were treated with 8 M urea. LT production was highest when E. coli strains were incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 degrees C for 12 h in CAYE-2 medium. Two hundred and five strains of E. coli, isolated from patients with diarrhea in Japan, Thailand, the United States, Mexico, and Brazil, were examined for LT. Of 133 LT-positive strains, 4 (3%) produced an LT that reacted like H-LT-1 (originally isolated from E. coli strain H-74-114) while 126 strains (94.7%) produced LT that reacted like H-LT-2 (originally isolated from strain H-10407) or H-LT-3 (from strain H-240-3). Three strains of human origin (2.3%) produced an LT that reacted like P-LT (produced by E. coli strains of porcine origin). This study shows that CBIB, a simple, efficient, and practical assay, might be useful for epidemiologic surveys and for evaluation of serologic responses to LTs and antitoxic vaccines.\r"

THP-1 cell TNF release in response to bacterial products generated during antibiotic killing of Escherichia coli (ATCC 12014) was evaluated. THP-1 is a mature monocytic leukemia cell line that produces TNF in a dose-dependent fashion in response to purified endotoxin. E. coli were incubated in the presence of amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, aztreonam, or imipenem at concentrations that killed greater than 99.9% of the organisms. Aliquots of these antibiotic-bacterial cultures were added to THP-1 cells, and TNF concentrations were determined by specific immunoassay. Amikacin and imipenem produced rapid bacterial killing and were associated with low TNF levels. Ceftazidime, aztreonam, and cefotaxime killed E. coli at a slower rate and were associated with significant increases in mononuclear cell TNF responses. Ciprofloxacin produced intermediate TNF levels. Differences exist among bactericidal antibodies in their ability to generate products capable of stimulating mononuclear cell TNF release.\r"

Two patients (22% [2/9] of all culture-proven cases of blastomycosis at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, over 15 years) developed CNS blastomycosis while receiving KTZ. Neither initially had CNS symptoms; both had cutaneous and pulmonary disease that responded to KTZ. If KTZ or other fungistatic imidazoles are to continue as primary therapy for blastomycosis, studies are needed to improve the ability to identify patients likely to experience treatment failure or develop CNS disease. Possibly all patients with disseminated blastomycosis, even those without CNS symptoms, should have lumbar puncture and computed tomography of the head before therapy. Critical evaluation of their immune function also may be required before making a therapeutic decision to use KTZ or amphotericin B.\r"

In this study, the cell-mediated immune responses to soluble adult and microfilarial extracts of Brugia pahangi, determined by use of a microblastogenesis assay, were examined. Capillary blood samples were collected by finger prick from 176 Haitian children in an area with endemic Wuchereria bancrofti. Antigen-specific cellular responsiveness varied as a function of infection status but not age or sex; amicrofilaremic children had significantly greater responses to adult antigens than did microfilaremic children. Significant responses were detected in children less than 2 years of age; thus, correlations observed between filarial antigen-specific responses and infection status are established early in life.\r"

Thirty adult Haitians with microfilaremia were treated with 1 mg of ivermectin to reduce counts of microfilariae. Later, subjects were treated with either one or two 200 micrograms/kg doses of ivermectin or with 12 daily 6 mg/kg doses of DEC. Macrofilaricidal activity of these drugs was indirectly monitored by measuring circulating W. bancrofti antigen by EIA. Antigen levels fell by 75% after DEC and by 34% after ivermectin. These results suggest that low-dose ivermectin treatment followed by a standard course of DEC is a more effective macrofilaricidal regimen for W. bancrofti than either of the multidose ivermectin regimens used in this study.\r"

  ".W": "Neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial pressures have been well characterized. The defence reaction is followed by increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Essential hypertension might be induced by such mechanisms. The defeat reaction is characterized by increased activity along the corticotropin releasing factor-adrenocorticotropin hormone-cortisol axis, resulting in the inhibition of gonadotropin secretion. Such endocrine disturbances are followed by metabolic aberrations, and probably also by the accumulation of visceral fat. Subjects with abdominal fat accumulation (high waist/hip circumference ratio, WHR) have recently been found to exhibit a number of psychosocial handicaps, together with endocrine aberrations characteristic of the defence and, in particular, the defeat reaction, as well as the associated circulatory and metabolic aberrations. Such abnormalities, including the WHR itself, are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It is postulated that increased WHR is a symptom of chronic hypothalamic arousal as a result of a defeat reaction to psychosocial pressures. This might lead to the development of disease via circulatory and metabolic derangements.\r"

  ".W": "Impairment of left ventricular (LV) function has previously been reported in patients with systemic sclerosis (SScl). An intermittent vasospastic process in the myocardium may contribute to the development of myocardial dysfunction. Vasodilators may therefore be potentially useful in the treatment of cardiac dysfunction in patients with SScl. This study was designed to evaluate the long-term effects of captopril on the myocardial function of patients with SScl. Twenty-two patients with SScl (15 patients with diffuse scleroderma and 7 patients with CREST syndrome, i.e. calcinosis. Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal hypomotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) were investigated by means of Doppler and echophonocardiography before and after treatment with captopril (1.3 mg kg-1 body weight d-1) for 11-15 months. There were no significant differences in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, end-systolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance or LV diameters before or after treatment. However, captopril treatment exerted significant effects on LV function: the pre-ejection period (PEP) and the ratio of pre-ejection period to LV ejection time decreased significantly (P less than 0.05). Mitral E-point septal separation decreased significantly (P less than 0.01), even after adjustment for LV end-diastolic diameter (P less than 0.01). The ejection fraction increased significantly (P less than 0.05), and the isovolumic relaxation time decreased (P less than 0.01). The left atrial emptying index increased (P less than 0.01). The Doppler peak late to early ventricular filling velocity decreased (P less than 0.05), and the isovolumic index was also reduced (P less than 0.05). We conclude that both systolic and diastolic LV function indices improved in patients with SScl after captopril treatment for a mean period of 1 year. The effects of captopril might be due to vasodilation of the myocardial vessels and/or a direct effect on the renin-angiotensin system of the heart.\r"

It is important to bear in mind that the ability to interpret the Korotkoff sounds correctly determines the levels of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. To improve the ability to distinguish between the Korotkoff phases, the handfree stethoscope and the hand-free method were developed. The improved stethoscope head was fixed under the edge of the cuff, thus reducing the noise generated from physiological tremor and other movements. This resulted in more distinct Korotkoff sounds. Furthermore, the new method reduced the spreading of blood pressure values. In 107 patients the average systolic blood pressure recording was 3.1 mmHg higher and the average diastolic blood pressure was 3.5 mmHg lower. We conclude that the new stethoscope and technique provide a means of significantly improving the indirect measurement of blood pressure.\r"

After 1 month, significantly lower systolic (P less than 0.01) and diastolic (P less than 0.02) blood pressures (BP) were achieved with E, 20 mg d-1, compared with V, 240 mg d-1. After 2 months of treatment, BP reductions were similar after E, 40 mg d-1, and V, 240 mg twice a day. The fall in supine mean BP after 2 months of treatment with V was significantly greater in patients aged greater than or equal to 50 years of age (P = 0.02) (median 18 mmHg) than in patients aged less than 50 years (10 mmHg). E showed similar effectiveness in both age groups. Statistical group analysis of a quality-of-life questionnaire showed no significant differences between the active drugs and the placebo. It is concluded that E and V are equally effective as antihypertensive agents, and that both drugs are well tolerated.\r"

A total of 25 subjects were fasted and given 5 mg oral folic acid; blood samples were taken at time zero and after 30, 60, 90 and 180 min. Absorption of folic acid appears to be significantly impaired in HIV disease, irrespective of the stage of the disease and notwithstanding gastro-intestinal complaints, pathogen-negative diarrhoea or drug treatment. We here present functional data, complementary to previously reported structural and biochemical findings, to support the hypothesis that the virus can cause an enteropathy in the absence of opportunist infection. Folinic acid is absorbed by the same gut mechanism as folic acid, so caution may be needed when employing oral folinic acid rescue procedures in these patients, even when resting serum and red cell folate levels appear to be normal.\r"

Weight problems, depression and sex of the respondent were not so important in this analysis. Arthritis, which often increases with age, appeared to be most strongly associated with pain, explaining in part why sleeping problems increase with age. Anxiety, pain and poor somatic health were most strongly associated with lying awake at night or sleeping badly, and anxiety and pain were most strongly correlated with taking longer to get to sleep. Poor somatic health and anxiety were most strongly associated with waking early, and age and pain were the most important variables in taking tablets to aid sleep.\r"

In patients with no suspected infarction (n = 2910), musculoskeletal (26%), obscure (21%) and psychogenic origins (16%) of the symptoms occurred most frequently.

Unequivocal dysplasia was found in one patient with extensive colitis and a disease duration of 31 years. A polyp with highly differentiated adenocarcinoma was found in the sigmoid colon of a patient with intermittent rectum involvement, 37 years after the ulcerative colitis diagnosis had been made. Biopsy specimens from the remaining 98 patients showed no signs of dysplasia or cancer. Thus the frequency of pre-malignant or malignant changes is very low compared with the results of similar studies, and the rationale for general colonoscopic surveillance programmes for such patients is open to question.\r"

As the disease may be diagnosed before the appearance of symptoms, and prevented by repeated phlebotomies, there are strong implications for adoption of a screening procedure. Determinations of transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin concentration (SF) were used to screen 4302 blood donors, who were selected for follow-up studies if they fulfilled any of the following three criteria: (i) TS greater than or equal to 0.7; (ii) TS greater than or equal to 0.5 together with SF greater than or equal to 150 micrograms l-1; (iii) SF greater than or equal to 300 micrograms l-1. A total of 58 subjects who fulfilled at least one of these criteria were reinvestigated, after which 18 individuals still fulfilled at least one criterion. Fifteen subjects having SF greater than or equal to 300 micrograms l-1 were offered liver biopsy and thirteen of these accepted. In one individual, no stainable iron was detected, and two subjects did not fulfil the previously established diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis. Ten subjects who had a high TS and liver iron grade 2-4 according to Bassett were classified accordingly as homozygotes. On the basis of these results, the prevalence of haemochromatosis in Denmark was estimated to be 0.0037-0.0046.\r"

The chest pain was most often described as oppressive and/or stabbing. In 95% of cases it was central or left-sided. Associated symptoms were commonly reported, breathlessness being most commonly reported by two-thirds of the patients, followed by dizziness, palpitation and numbness/tingling. Mental symptoms such as tiredness, anxiety and tension were frequently reported. On the basis of the background literature the aetiology is discussed. We conclude that immediate symptom analysis, including psychosomatic symptoms, particularly breathing problems, is of central importance.\r"

We here describe the case of a patient who responded dramatically to a combination of prostacyclin and plasma infusions, after conventional therapy had failed (plasmapheresis, fresh frozen plasma infusions). Prostacyclin was infused intravenously initially for 120 h from 4 to 9 ng kg min-1 and then continuously for 48 h at 9 ng kg min-1. Despite the scarcity of case reports in the literature, we conclude that the failure of prostacyclin in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura appears to be related to insufficient doses and/or duration of therapy.\r"

S-100 was focally positive in three of the colloid and one of the enterogenous cysts while vimentin and GFAP were negative in both. The anatomical distribution of both colloid and enterogenous cysts is reviewed. An illustrative case of an identical cyst within the fourth ventricle is presented. This suggests that the similarities between colloid and enterogenous cysts and the presence of identical lesions along the neuroaxis indicate that these structures are derived from primitive foregut endoderm.\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity and specificity of Hachinski's Ischaemic Score (IS) in the diagnosis of the vascular aetiology of dementia was studied in a series of 32 demented patients, dementia of the Alzheimer type (16), multi-infarct dementia (7), mixed dementia (6), Pick's disease (3), with neuropathological diagnosis as the point of reference. The IS distinguished between primary degenerative dementia and multi-infarct or mixed dementia. As single features of the IS \"a positive history of stroke\" and \"a fluctuating course\" showed differing prevalences in the latter two diagnostic categories. The IS labelled 21% of patients with primary degenerative dementia as having a vascular aetiology. The uncritical application of the IS to large samples in epidemiological studies may cause incorrect labelling of a significant proportion of patients with primary degenerative dementia as vascular dementia. These results are based on observations of long-term inpatients and depend on neuropathological criteria. While the definite diagnosis of DAT by threshold criteria concerning plaque and tangle counts is well established, neither clinical nor pathological evidence of stroke necessarily means that cerebrovascular disease has anything to do with a patient's dementia.\r"

There was a total of 1407 instances of trauma, which were sorted into various categories. Overall there was no significant correlation between all-traumas and disease activity. There was, however, a statistically significant negative correlation between traumatic episodes and exacerbations in 95 patients who had exacerbations during the programme, due primarily to less activity of the disease during a three month period following surgical procedures and fractures. Electrical injury had a significant positive association with exacerbation using a three month at-risk period, but there were no other significant positive correlations in any other category of trauma, including minor head injuries; there were no cases of head injury with prolonged unconsciousness. There was no linkage between the frequency of trauma and progression of disability. MS patients had two to three times more trauma than controls.\r"

In the control group, the mean (SD) SWJ frequency (SWJ larger than 1 degree amplitude) was 2.3 (2.4)/min. Abnormal ocular fixation (SWJ frequency greater than 10/min) was observed in a large proportion of PSP patients (7/8) and of MSA/PP patients (16/25) but in few PD patients (13/85). In the group of PD patients with abnormal ocular fixation, freezing of gait, falls and instability were more severe than in the group of PD patients with normal fixation. The study of ocular fixation may help to differentiate PD clinically from other Parkinsonian syndromes. SWJ are probably not related to the central degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway observed in PD.\r"

Before treatment event-related potential P3 and task performance were normal but the reaction time was prolonged compared with age matched controls. After treatment P3 latency was significantly prolonged and the reaction time reduced suggesting a dopamine induced dissociation between cognitive and motor processing. In early Parkinson's disease cognitive processing time remains normal but the motor processing time is prolonged. Dopamine replacement is followed by significantly reduced motor processing time despite increased cognitive processing time. Motor processing may reflect the dopamine status of the putamen whereas dopaminergic over-stimulation of other regions may adversely affect cognitive processing in patients treated with levodopa.\r"

A lesser indication is failure of dietary management to reduce a high plasma phytanic acid level.\r"

Recordings during deep anaesthesia without muscle paralysis revealed an initial negative potential (D wave) at about 2 ms with electrical stimulation in five of the six patients. This was followed by a muscle potential which obscured any later waveforms. Magnetic stimulation produced clear potentials in only one patient. The earliest wave to magnetic stimulation during deep anaesthesia was 1-2 ms later than the earliest potential to electrical stimulation. Following lightening of the anaesthetic and the administration of muscle relaxants a series of later negative potentials (I waves) were more clearly seen to both electrical and magnetic stimulation. More I waves were recorded to magnetic stimulation during light anaesthesia than during deep anaesthesia. Increasing the intensity of electrical stimulation also produced an extra late I wave. At the highest intensity of magnetic stimulation the latency of the earliest potential was comparable to the D wave to electrical stimulation. The intervals between these various D and I waves corresponded to those previously described for the timing of single motor unit discharge after cortical stimulation.\r"

Physostigmine (1 mg single intravenous injection) increased nystagmus in five additional patients with downbeat (1) or positional downbeat nystagmus (4) for a duration of 15-20 minutes. The different interactions of baclofen and physostigmine on neurotransmission subserving vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex could account for these effects. The response to baclofen appears to be a GABA-B-ergic effect with augmentation of the physiological inhibitory influence of the vestibulo-cerebellum on the vestibular nuclei. Similarly baclofen has an inhibitory effect on the velocity storage mechanism. Cholinergic action may cause the increment of nystagmus by physostigmine.\r"

Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans.\r"

In contrast, treatment of virus-infected mice with sera or immunoglobulin G (IgG) from mice immunized with homogenized spinal cord (SCH) emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant promotes CNS remyelination. We measured levels of infectious virus, virus antigen and virus-specific antibody to determine if treatments which promote CNS remyelination are able to modulate infection. Levels of virus-specific antibody were higher in mice treated with SCH/IgG than control treatment groups and correlated positively with extent of remyelination. Although number of virus antigen-positive cells in spinal cord was less in mice treated with SCH/IgG than mice treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/IgG, there was only a slight negative correlation with extent of remyelination by regression analysis. Titers of infectious virus isolated three to six months following infection were not different among treatment groups. Even though treatment of mice with SCH/IgG reduced number of virus antigen-positive cells and enhanced levels of virus-specific antibody, CNS remyelination can occur despite presence of infectious virus.\r"

This disorder is associated with deficiency of lysosomal beta-mannosidase and accumulation of oligosaccharides. Analysis of bovine beta-mannosidosis neuropathology was initiated to determine whether independently arising gene defects in cattle and goats result in expression of similar lesions. Brain, spinal cord, and selected peripheral nerves from seven affected newborn Salers calves and three normal newborn calves were available for gross, light microscopic, and electron microscopic analysis. Gross examination revealed hydrocephalus of variable severity and myelin deficiency in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brainstem. Microscopic examination revealed cytoplasmic vacuolation, myelin deficiency, and axonal spheroids of similar type and distribution to that reported in affected goats. Cytoplasmic vacuolation resulting from lysosomal storage showed consistent variation among cell types. Myelin deficits were more severe in the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum than in the spinal cord. Axonal spheroids occurred in the cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, and trigeminal nerve endings. The presence of similar lesions in bovine and caprine beta-mannosidosis supports a direct relationship with the gene defect.\r"

  ".W": "Ubiquitin-immunoreactivity was studied in Down's syndrome brains ranging in age from two days to sixty years. Numerous randomly distributed ubiquitin-immunoreactive dot-like structures in the white matter were shown to correspond to granular degeneration of myelin. Granular degeneration of myelin was first detected at age 21 and increased thereafter with age. Other larger and more coarsely granular ubiquitin-immunoreactive structures, most numerous in the middle and upper cortical layers, were consistent with dystrophic neurites. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that the dystrophic neurites contained non-filamentous, membranous, dense bodies. In Down's syndrome, ubiquitin-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites were first detected at age six in the hippocampus, and were consistently more numerous in comparison to age-matched control subjects. In the presence of amyloid, either as diffuse or as compact deposits, ubiquitin-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites frequently formed aggregates consistent with senile plaques. Although apparently independent events, these data suggest that amyloid deposition is associated with local accentuation of ubiquitin-immunoreactive neuritic dystrophy. In addition, since dystrophic neurites appeared substantially earlier in the grey matter in Down's syndrome than in age-matched normals, this may be further evidence that selective aspects of aging are accelerated in Down's syndrome.\r"

After three months, the surface of the brain stem, cerebellum, and piriform cortex showed a distinct brown color, and staining of the gross specimens for iron produced an intense blue color which extended for a distance of 1-2 mm into the brain parenchyma. Enhanced iron stains of vibratome sections revealed the accumulation of reaction product in microglia and Bergmann glia of the cerebellar cortex, and in microglia and astrocytes of the piriform cortex. Ferritin immunocytochemistry revealed reaction product in cerebellar microglia and Bergmann glia which strongly resembled that obtained by the enhanced iron stain. In the piriform cortex, only microglia were reactive with anti-ferritin. Electron microscopy confirmed the accumulation of electron-dense ferritin granules only in the cytoplasm of microglia. Bergmann glia in the cerebellum and astrocytic processes in the piriform cortex were replete with intermediate filaments and contained an excess of glycogen. After six months, small granules of hemosiderin began to appear in cerebellar and piriform cortices. The observations support that the sequence of conversion of hemoglobin to ferritin and hemosiderin occurs in brain as in other organs.\r"

The Nauta method reveals the degeneration not only of nerve fibers, myelinated and unmyelinated, but also of their terminations. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations appear to prove that the Nauta technique indeed stains axons in human autopsy material. The optimal survival time for the use of the Nauta method was found to be between nine days and five months. In cases with longer survival times--up to 20 months--the Nauta technique and a previously proposed polarizing technique (showing birefringent breakdown products of myelin) can be used as complementary methods. Applying these techniques to the human brain may help define the anatomical basis of neurological and neuropsychological symptoms important for man.\r"

  ".W": "Nerves in patients with inherited tendency to pressure palsy (ITPP) are susceptible to degrees of traction or compression which in nonaffected persons do not induce neuropathic symptoms or deficits, conduction block of fibers, or electromyographic changes characteristic of the disorder. Two observations suggest a widespread asymptomatic abnormality of nerves: 1) low conduction velocity of clinically unaffected nerves, and 2) focal thickenings (tomacula) on teased myelinated fibers of clinically unaffected sural nerves. Sural nerves from five patients and five healthy subjects were assessed for morphologic abnormality in ITPP that might account for the susceptibility of nerves to compression. Teased nerve fibers showed a higher frequency of segmental demyelination or remyelination, or both (p less than 0.003). The mean frequency of fibers showing focal myelin thickenings was 57 +/- 10% in ITPP and 0% in controls. In electron micrographs, regions of uncompacted myelin lamellae, usually affecting the innermost lamellae and extending for a variable distance averaging 9 +/- 4 microns were seen in 11 +/- 4% of fibers in ITPP. None were found in the control nerves. The finding of uncompacted myelin lamellae may suggest an abnormality of myelin composition or of interaction of Schwann cells and axons accounting for the increased susceptibility to pressure palsy, tomaculous formation, or demyelination. From electron microscopic evaluation of serial skip sections we infer that myelin of tomaculae is in continuity with internodal myelin and is reduplicated (full-thickness or cleaved layers are longitudinally or circumferentially folded-back on themselves).\r"

  ".W": "Using synthetic peptides representing specific regions of the bovine myelin protein P2, the minimum peptide length requirement for the T-cell epitope necessary for successful production of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) has been shown to involve residues 61-70 of the P2 protein. In this study, morphometric analysis was used to compare the histologic changes in sciatic nerves of Lewis rats after disease was induced by P2 specific neuritogenic T-cell lines (P(2)3) or, alternatively, by direct inoculation of synthetic peptides representing residues 60-70 or 61-70 of the P2 protein sequence. Inoculation with cell line P(2)3 stimulated with residue 61-70 failed to elicit demyelination in sciatic nerves. However, cells stimulated with residue 60-70 produced inflammation, endoneurial edema, mild demyelination and axonal degeneration within seven days. In contrast, disease induced with either peptide by direct sensitization was more severe. Morphometric analysis revealed that inflammation was most severe in animals sensitized to the decapeptide. In the sciatic nerve, axonal degeneration was proportional in frequency to the extent of inflammation. Inflammation was especially intense in spinal roots with extensive destruction of axons including unmyelinated fibers. Spinal root changes were associated with Wallerian degeneration in the posterior white matter tracts of the spinal cord and were apparently secondary to endoneurial inflammation. Disruption of the blood-nerve-barrier (BNB), evident as physical separation of endothelial cells in association with severe perivascular inflammation, was observed.\r"

Morphometric analysis using the two-dimensional (area) measurement by CT was performed in the infratentorial region. The brain-stem index, an index of brain-stem atrophy or pontine atrophy, revealed a significant decrease (P less than 0.01), with a mean of 66.7% when compared with 16 control subjects. The patients showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01), with a mean of three times that of the controls in the fourth ventricular index, an index of fourth ventricular dilatation. There were no differences in the cerebellar index, an index of cerebellar atrophy, between these patients and the controls, although the patients had an increased number of visible cerebellar vermian (2.0, SD 0.7) and hemispheric sulci (2.6 SD 0.6) as compared with the controls (vermian sulci: 0.4, SD 0.7: hemispheric sulci: 0). These data indicate severe pontine atrophy, fourth ventricular dilatation with mild involvement of the cerebellum and correlate well with the common pathological features of Joseph disease. The present morphometric evaluation by CT may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of Joseph disease.\r"

These measurements were taken at least 12 h after therapy had been withdrawn and were repeated after therapy had been resumed. Significant changes in the different heart rate variation indices were found in the parkinsonian patients which correlated with the duration and severity of the extrapyramidal symptomatology. After standing the patients showed a significant drop in blood pressure, when compared respectively with their base values and with the response in controls. Anticholinergic drugs had no significant effect on the heart rate variation indices, whereas antiparkinsonian therapy seems to have contributed to the drop in blood pressure after standing.\r"

These findings suggested that PV-Ir neurons in the cortex are not affected in PD brains. A significant loss of PV-Ir neurons has already been reported in brains obtained from patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD), and the present results suggest the possibility that the damage of PV-Ir neurons might be comparatively selective for ATD brains.\r"

We found a significant reduction of CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA+ cells in the CSF of MS patients. Similarly, CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA+ CSF/PB ratios were lower compared with controls. The reduction of suppressor-inducer T-cells did not correlate with CD8+ cell levels in the CSF. The CD4+ subset ratio (CD4+CD45RA-/CD4+CD45RA+) was significantly increased in the CSF of MS patients. Our data suggest that the reduction of CD4+CD45RA+ cells in the PB is not due to a segregation of such cells in the CSF. Conversely, CSF changes reflect changes in the PB similar to these found for other T-cell subsets.\r"

Ten out of 18 patients had abnormal BAEPs, the main abnormality being complete absence of responses and disappearance of wave V. Combined degeneration of the peripheral and central acoustic pathways probably accounts for these findings. The blink reflex was abnormal in 50% of the cases. The outstanding abnormality was bilateral delay of late responses with normal early response, which could be correlated with the known pallor of the descending trigeminal tracts. In contrast with BAEP findings, blink reflex abnormalities did not correlate with either the age of patients or the severity and duration of the disease. These data suggest a difference in susceptibility to degeneration between the auditory system and neuronal system subserving the blink reflex. We conclude that systematic BAEP and blink reflex recording is useful in the electrophysiological evaluation of FA patients.\r"

Twenty-one of 40 grade III/IV tumours, but only 1 of 16 grade I/II tumours were found to contain amplified and/or rearranged c-erbB sequences. This highly significant difference suggest that c-erbB amplification, rearrangement, or both, are important steps in malignant transformation in a subset of patients with neuroepithelial tumours.\r"

  ".W": "Monitoring of pyridostigmine therapy in patients with myasthenia gravis is not routinely performed, since the daily pyridostigmine doses are adjusted to the patient's actual clinical status rather than to pyridostigmine plasma concentrations (PPC). Moreover, PPC determination is time-consuming and needs much technical equipment. Since pyridostigmine reversible blocks acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at the neuromuscular junction, we studied the correlation between the enzyme's blood activity (erythrocyte-bound AChE) and PPC, on the one hand, and between blood AChE activity and the clinical status of the individual patient, on the other. In five previously untreated patients with myasthenia gravis blood AChE activity decreased in accordance with the actual PPC after a single oral dose of 60 mg pyridostigmine (group A). Amelioration of the clinical status corresponded to the decrease of AChE activity in the same way. In another five patients, who were on stable pyridostigmine medication for at least 1 week, AChE activity and PPC were constant during the day (group B). Since it is easier to perform than PPC, our results suggest that the determination of AChE activity may be superior to measuring PPC for monitoring cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in selected cases.\r"

We have used the Mov-14 model previously to demonstrate the antiviral efficacy and lack of teratogenicity of transplacental therapy with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, ZDV). PMEA was administered to pregnant females by daily intraperitoneal injection or by osmotic pump. In contrast to ZDV, PMEA was either noneffective in preventing viremia in the offspring or embryotoxic, depending on the dose. The specific toxic effects seen were resorption of pregnancy, low birth weight, and neonatal death. Histopathological analysis of neonatal mice exposed to PMEA showed severe lymphoid depletion of the thymus. We conclude that PMEA therapy is contraindicated for use during pregnancy.\r"

Subjects had two to four cutaneous KS indicator lesions treated with liquid nitrogen cyrotherapy. Treatment was repeated at 3 week intervals, allowing adequate healing time. On average, subjects received three treatments per lesion with a mean follow-up time of 11 weeks (range of 6-25 weeks). One treatment consisted of two freeze-thaw cycles, with thaw times ranging from 11 to 60 s per cycle. A complete response was observed in 80% of treated KS lesions and lasted a minimum of 6 weeks following the completion of therapy. Greater than 50% cosmetic improvement of KS was observed. Histopathology of treated lesions correlated poorly with cosmetic improvement. Response was not predicted by tolerance to zidovudine therapy, CD4+ cell count, presence of B symptoms, or previous chemotherapy. Subjects without prior history of opportunistic infection (OI) were more likely to have a better response than those with a prior history of OI. Subjects tolerated cryotherapy well. Blistering occurred frequently, but local pain was limited and relieved by acetaminophen. Secondary infection did not occur. Based on this study, we recommend cryotherapy to subjects with cutaneous KS lesions. Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy is easily applied as a primary therapy, and may also have a role in the treatment of cutaneous KS lesions that respond slowly or show incomplete cosmetic improvement with systemic therapies.\r"

Participants had been receiving placebo or ZDV at doses of 800-1,200 mg daily for a median 52 weeks at the time of evaluation. Neuropathic symptoms and abnormalities of motor and sensory function were present in fewer than 10% of both treatment groups. Depressed reflexes were found in 19% of the ZDV group and 18% of the placebo group. Quantitative sensory testing for vibration was abnormal in fewer than 10% of participants and the absolute scores favored the ZDV group. We thus found a low prevalence of peripheral nerve abnormalities and no evidence of ZDV neurotoxicity in this population.\r"

Major factors associated with care that could have been provided at an alternative site included difficulty with skilled nursing facility placement in 20% of the patients, difficulty coordinating out-of-hospital care in 28%, and scheduling of outpatient surgical procedures in 12%. For the 15 patients who could have received some of their care at a lower intensity setting, a median of 7 hospital days could have been potentially saved with better coordination of outpatient care and increased availability of skilled nursing facilities. The five patients who died in hospital also used large amounts of resources and had long lengths of stay. Prior studies of non-AIDS patients revealed similar results, suggesting that, for reasons of quality of care, quality of life, and economics, policy-makers must develop managed care programs, skilled nursing facilities that accept AIDS patients, inpatient psychiatry facilities, and increased hospice availability.\r"

The study design was a multicenter, prospective, descriptive single-dose pharmacokinetic study. Each of 66 fasting, male, HIV-infected homosexuals older than 18 years of age and in CDC classifications II, III, and IVC2 received a single 400-mg oral dose of AZT with subsequent pharmacokinetic measurements performed during an 8-h period for AZT and its major metabolite, glucuronylazidothymidine (GAZT). Results were obtained in 65 patients (36 smokers, 29 nonsmokers), of whom 3 were noted to have hepatic dysfunction. In those with normal hepatic function, the following parameters were described: AZT, area under the curve (AUC) +/- SD, 9.9 +/- 5.7 microM.h, maximum concentration (Cmax) +/- SD, 7.3 +/- 4.7 microM; time to maximum concentration (Tmax) +/- SD, 0.93 +/- 0.42 h, and half-life (t1/2) +/- SD, 1.0 +/- 0.8 h. Corresponding values for GAZT were: AUC +/- SD 35.7 +/- 10.3 microM.h, Cmax +/- SD 21.3 +/- 7.3 microM, Tmax +/- SD 1.2 +/- 0.50 h, t1/2 +/- SD 0.98 +/- 0.62 h, No significant differences were found in comparisons of study site, CDC classification of disease, smokers versus nonsmokers, and in patients with hepatic dysfunction, although a higher AUC and earlier Cmax for AZT was noted in the latter group. It is concluded that AZT pharmacokinetics are similar in patients with early asymptomatic HIV disease when compared with previous reports in patients with later disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Inverse correlations were observed between prognosis and levels of these serum products. Prediction by CD4+ T-cell count of tumor regression after treatment with interferon-alpha and zidovudine was improved by each of two factors: (a) the presence or absence of endogenous interferon-alpha activity, and (b) a combined variable reflecting relative levels of the interferon-inducible products, beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin. The level of beta 2-microglobulin was the single best predictor of survival. When beta 2-microglobulin was not considered, the endogenous interferon-alpha variable was the best predictor of survival, and the prediction was enhanced by addition of the combined variable, or the neopterin value alone. We conclude that serologic markers, which directly or indirectly reflect activation of the endogenous interferon system, may be valuable adjuncts to CD4+ T-cell counts in assessing prognosis and selecting and evaluating treatments for patients with Kaposi sarcoma and AIDS.\r"

No project participant has become HIV infected during the study period and a reduction in risk behavior has been noted among local drug injectors. The HIV prevention project has attracted many individuals with no previous contact with drug rehabilitation programs; for a number of drug users, the syringe exchange has served as an introduction to such treatment efforts.\r"

Although a polygamous society, three-fourths of married men had only one wife. The number of sexual partners at any one time was generally low. However, the divorce rate was more than 29% and 55% of married men had current sexual partners in addition to their wives. Knowledge about AIDS was widespread, yet 4% of men interviewed had had a sexual encounter with a prostitute within the last month. Use of condoms was very limited and 66% of customers of high-class prostitutes refused to use a condom even after a request to do so by the prostitute. Skin piercing, including scarification, was done by an unsterile instrument by 39% of 74 rural traditional healers, many of whom had more than one patient per day. To combat the spread of AIDS, Ghanaians will have to apply their knowledge of AIDS risk factors to their actual behavior. Many of the social customs are products of poverty and its ensuing social consequences. Funds are needed for specific AIDS prevention programs as well as improved education and health care throughout the country.\r"

  ".W": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to be associated with class II HLA antigens in most populations, but recent studies in Israeli Jewish patients showed no significant differences in either DR4 or DR1 between patients and controls. In a previous DR4 subset study we found DR4-Dw15 to be associated with susceptibility (RR = 9.2) but this allele occurred in only 12% of the patients. We analyzed all DRB1 genes, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization with allele specific oligonucleotides, in 49 Jewish patients with RA and 40 normal Jewish controls. Six DRB1 alleles that are similar to the prototype DR4-Dw4 (DRB1*0401) appeared to contribute to the risk for developing RA. In addition to DR4-Dw15 (DRB1*0405) 2 other alleles having substitutions in codons 71 only (DR1-Dw1/DRB1*0101, DR4-Dw14.2/DRB1*0408) or in codons 70 and 71 (DRw10/DRB1*1001) gave highly significant relative risks. Together, this group, with valine in position 85, and glycine in codon 86, gave a relative risk of 11.0 (p = 0.0002). Two other alleles with the same sequence in the third hypervariable region (amino acids 67-74) but with valine in codon 86 (DR4-Dw14.1/DRB1*0404) or alanine in 85 and valine in 86 (DR1-Dw20, DRB1*0102) gave a combined risk of 3.6 (p = 0.049). Altogether these 7 alleles with similar sequences in the third hypervariable region accounted for 55.6% of the patients, with an overall relative risk of 8.6 (p = 0.00002). Our results in this population indicate that shared epitopes in the third hypervariable region of DRB1 alleles also play a role in susceptibility to RA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In yearly followup over the past 7 years, 20 malignant conditions have been reported in 530 DMARD treated adult patients with RA. Incidence density ratios (IDR) and standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated to assess cancer risk. For all cancers the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.90-2.60). For men the SMR was 1.71 (95% CI 0.84-3.52); for women the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.89-2.60). Adjusted for age, the IDR was highest in the 70-79-year-old study population (3.41). The age and sex adjusted SMR for lymphoproliferative disorders and myeloma was 8.05 (95% CI 3.30-20.81). The SMR for lung cancer (n = 6) was also increased (3.37; 95% CI 1.58-7.34). Compared with the general population, patients with RA requiring DMARD therapy may be at increased risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders. The RAAR is an important prospective technique which will ultimately permit assessment of neoplasia risk by type and duration of DMARD therapy.\r"

The groups were well balanced in baseline characteristics. In the cyclosporine group, 10 patients stopped prematurely, one because of inefficacy. In the D-penicillamine group, 9 patients stopped prematurely, 3 because of inefficacy. The 2 antirheumatic drugs were equally effective in reducing disease activity, except for a significant (p = 0.005) decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate with D-penicillamine treatment. We conclude that under the conditions of this trial, cyclosporine can serve as an alternative to D-penicillamine for the treatment of patients with RA.\r"

Multivariate analysis indicates that RF and cryoglobulins, operating independently, have a significant and opposite association with the development of renal disease in patients with SLE. These associations appear to be unrelated to the presence or absence of anti-ds-DNA (anti-DNA). Patients with SLE who are RF negative and cryoglobulin positive are likely to develop renal disease whereas those who are RF positive and cryoglobulin negative are very unlikely to do so. The addition of RF and cryoglobulin determinations to the data base of patients with SLE appears to be clinically useful.\r"

SLE, a disease with varied clinical manifestations also has regulatory T cell subset abnormalities in blood. Levels of sIL-2R in serum of patients with active SLE were higher than in those with other common rheumatic diseases. Patients with active SLE and an increased percentage of CD4+ CDw29+ helper inducer (memory) and decreased percentage of CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor inducer (virgin) T cell subsets in blood demonstrated elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum. When compared with clinical manifestations of the disease, the sIL-2R levels in the sera of the patients with active SLE and thrombocytopenia were higher (mean 1710 units/ml) than those in active SLE with nephrotic syndrome (mean 1230 units/ml) or in active SLE with central nervous system disease (mean 1157 units/ml). However, patients with active SLE with humoral immunodeficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia) had highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum as compared to other patients with active SLE. The highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum may indicate that in vivo T cell activation plays an important role in this disease.\r"

When a weekly oral dosing regimen was used, joint destruction was attenuated when this agent was administered at a dose of 50 to 200 mg/kg. Inflammation associated with a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in dogs was suppressed at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg or a weekly dose of 1 mg/kg. At efficacious doses, CL 306,293 had no effects on cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase activities nor did it have an effect on carrageenin induced paw edema. In acute tests, the compound was not ulcerogenic. The above observations indicate that the antiinflammatory effects of CL 306,293 are distinct from those observed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Mechanistic studies conducted and to be published indicate that CL 306,293 down regulates T cell function and this mechanism may account, at least in part, for the antiinflammatory and antiarthritic properties observed in animal models of inflammation and joint destruction.\r"

HA crystals were conspicuous and abundant in specimens from 21 of the 40 patients studied. Patients in whom HA was present had significantly larger effusions (13.0 +/- 8.9 vs 8.7 +/- 6.1 ml, p less than 0.05). They also tended to have radiologically more severe disease (radiological grade: 2.91 +/- 0.92 vs 2.39 +/- 0.85, p = 0.056). No difference in keratan sulfate (KS) concentrations was observed. Moreover, despite the presence in some specimens of numerous free histiocytes which were actively phagocytosing HA aggregates, the concentrations of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), a monocyte product with cartilage and bone resorbing activity, were below the limit of detection (20 pg/ml). Our results confirm that HA crystals are a common finding in patients with OA of the knee and show that HA is associated with larger effusions, but not increased SF concentrations of cartilage proteoglycan substituents (KS) or IL-1 beta.\r"

DIP changes were apparent later in the course of the disease and were less severe than in other affected joints. Soft tissue swelling and joint space narrowing were the most frequent abnormalities in the DIP joints. Erosive changes and angular deformities were uncommon. There was no significant correlation between DIP joint involvement and sex, age at presentation, involvement of the hands and wrists at presentation, or positivity of either rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibody. There was a strong correlation between the presence of extraarticular signs and symptoms and involvement of the DIP joints; however, this may reflect the greater severity of the disease in these patients generally.\r"

  ".W": "A new urethral stent developed for use in recurrent urethral strictures is presented. This metallic coil is self-expanding when released from its introducing catheter. The stent was used in 18 patients with recurrent strictures necessitating frequent dilation or urethrotomy. The stent is introduced under fluoroscopic guidance after internal urethrotomy or simple dilation. Strictures of 5 to 60 mm. were treated successfully with this device. All strictures were distal to the external sphincter. No serious complications attributed to the device were recorded. When necessary, the stent could be repositioned either under fluoroscopic control or endoscopically. This device can hold the stenotic area of the urethra open for long intervals allowing for complete healing. Even after 6 months the stent is not covered with urethral epithelium and does not become incorporated into the urethral wall. It can be removed easily without an operation by simple manipulation. The large internal caliber permits passage of endoscopes up to 17F in patients who require cystoscopy. The device can be removed before transurethral resections and then a new stent can be inserted at the end of the procedure. Mean followup of our patients with the stent indwelling was 8 months (range 4 to 11 months). Followup after removal of the stent (6 patients) was 3 to 8 months (mean 5 months). The patients voided well during followup and were fully continent. No incrustations were noted in the removed stents even after 6 months and no stent became obstructed due to tissue proliferation or incrustation. In 1 patient the stricture recurred after 3 months and a new stent was inserted. Urine sterilization was obtained in 7 patients with infected urine after relatively short courses of antibiotics. This stent seems to be a promising tool for the nonoperative treatment of recurrent urethral strictures.\r"

In the determination of an effective dosage, 5 ng. (2 patients), 50 ng. (2 patients), 500 ng. (4 patients), 5 micrograms (4 patients) and 25 micrograms (7 patients) were injected intracavernously, and pulse and blood pressure were monitored. Arterial inflow was measured by Doppler sonography, smooth muscle relaxation was determined by the analysis of cavernous electrical activity and cavernous outflow occlusion was recorded by cavernosometry. In 12 patients the erectile response of prostaglandin E1 was compared to the response of an equal (6 patients) or decreased dose of prostaglandin E1 combined with an equal weight of calcitonin-gene-related peptide. In 14 patients the erectile response to the combination of calcitonin-gene-related peptide and prostaglandin E1 was compared to the response of prostaglandin E1 alone, and with a combination of 15 mg./ml. papaverine and 0.5 mg./ml. phentolamine. Calcitonin-gene-related peptide induced an increase in the penile arterial inflow, cavernous smooth muscle relaxation and cavernous outflow occlusion. Histochemical results indicated nerve fibers positive for calcitonin-gene-related peptide within the cavernous bodies. A dose-dependent erectile response to calcitonin-gene-related peptide was observed at doses of 500 ng. to 25 micrograms. Systemic side effects were first observed at a dose of 25 micrograms in 2 of 7 patients. The combination of calcitonin-gene-related peptide and prostaglandin E1 was more effective in inducing a full erection than either prostaglandin E1 alone or the combination of papaverine and phentolamine. Pain was reported in 4% of the patients who received the combination of calcitonin-gene-related peptide and prostaglandin E1, whereas 42% of those who received prostaglandin E1 alone reported pain. Our results suggest that calcitonin-gene-related peptide may be a possible neurotransmitter for penile erection. A combination of calcitonin-gene-related peptide and prostaglandin E1 seems to be an effective alternative combination in the treatment of impotence.\r"

With standard psychophysical methodology, subjective thresholds were determined from a minimum of 5 threshold crossings. Results indicated a significant elevation in threshold after intracavernous papaverine injection, even though only partial erection was induced in most subjects. Men with erectile dysfunction had higher thresholds than control subjects but no difference in sensitivity was found between the base and tip of the penis. These findings indicate that low penile sensitivity is characteristic of some, although not all, men experiencing erectile problems and that this sensitivity is even lower during tumescence.\r"

Previous reports detailing experience with this treatment are based on patient populations significantly younger than most patients who suffer from impotence. The geriatric population, which comprises the majority of patients with importance, is unique due to the physical, psychological and social changes associated with the aging process. To characterize better elderly men with impotence, and determine whether intracavernous injection therapy is safe and effective in this age group, a retrospective analysis was performed upon patients attending the male sexual dysfunction clinic at our university medical center who received a standard papaverine and phentolamine mixture (30 mg. papaverine and 1.0 mg. phentolamine per ml.). The etiology of impotence, degree of patient satisfaction and complication rate of 65 patients 65 years or older (mean age 70 years) undergoing papaverine plus phentolamine self-injection therapy were compared to a similar size group of impotent men approximately 20 years younger (mean age 47 years). Significant differences in etiology of impotence were evident between the 2 groups. Treatment response rates were equal for the 2 age groups although elderly patients required a higher dose of papaverine and phentolamine to obtain an erection, and used the medication less frequently. Complications were few, of minimal consequence and occurred with equal frequency between the 2 age groups.\r"

We compared the flow cytometric and histological data of these stable and growing teratomas, and of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors before chemotherapy. The DNA content of residual teratoma did not differ significantly from that of the primary testicular tumors (1.38 versus 1.48). Histological analysis of stable and growing teratomas revealed no significant difference but proliferative cellular nuclear antigen was expressed mainly in the epithelial component of the growing teratoma. alpha-Fetoprotein, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and carcinoembryonic antigen were elevated in the fluid of 6 excised teratomas, while concomitant serum levels were normal. The aneuploidy and elevated cystic fluid tumor markers confirm the malignant phenotype of post-chemotherapy residual teratomas. Therefore, complete surgical removal is essential despite the benign histological appearance.\r"

The procedure did not interfere with histological diagnosis. Median labeling index was 0.87% (range 0.1 to 29.3%). A labeling index exceeding 3% was unusual but it may indicate the potential for rapid clinical progression. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) flow cytometry was performed on the last 44 carcinomas using cells shed by the prostatic needle biopsy tissue samples during transportation to the pathology laboratory. A sufficient number of cells were obtained for analysis in 37 cases, of which 6 were DNA aneuploid. Labeling index correlated with Gleason histological grade and score, and data from the 6 DNA aneuploid carcinomas suggest association between DNA aneuploidy and a high labeling index. Estimates of percentage of S-phase cells by flow cytometry did not correlate with variables other than DNA index, and appear to have been affected by a high noise-to-signal ratio (few proliferative cells relative to cellular debris) and inability to discriminate between benign and carcinomatous cells.\r"

  ".W": "From 1966 to 1979, 360 patients with clinical stages A2, B and C1 prostate cancer underwent staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, and completed a course of combined interstitial radioactive gold seeds and external beam radiotherapy. All patients had a normal serum prostatic acid phosphatase level and a bone scan negative for metastases. All patients were followed until death or for a mean of 7.3 years (range 1.2 to 18.25 years) for those alive at analysis. To determine the risk of dying of prostate cancer we reviewed the records of the 142 patients (39%) who died. At analysis 21% of the patients had died of prostate cancer and 17% of other known causes. The cause of death could not be determined in 4 patients (1%). Cardiovascular disease accounted for a fifth of all deaths. The actuarial risk of death of prostate cancer for all patients was 8 +/- 3% (+/- 2 standard errors) at 5 years and 30 +/- 7% at 10 years. The risk of death of all causes was 16 +/- 4% at 5 years and 46 +/- 7% at 10 years. An increased risk of cancer death was associated with established risk factors, including advanced local disease, poorly differentiated histology, pelvic nodal metastases and distant recurrence. We also noted a substantial risk of cancer death in patients who had local tumor recurrence. While previous studies have reported a relatively low incidence of cancer deaths (4 to 17%) in patients initially diagnosed with localized disease, our data suggest that prostate cancer is the major cause of mortality in such patients. Aggressive curative therapy, regardless of treatment modality, should be considered for localized prostate cancer in men with a life expectancy of 10 or more years.\r"

Complete responders were defined as patients clinically well with normal PSA, clinical failures were patients with documented local tumor recurrence or distant metastases and chemical failures were patients clinically well but with a PSA level above the upper limits of normal. Correlations with pre-treatment PSA values were also made for the 50 of 143 patients for whom pre-treatment PSA data were available. Median patient followup was 27 months (range 18 to 91 months). The data were analyzed with parametric and nonparametric univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. Pre-treatment PSA levels increased with increasing tumor stage (p = 0.004) but not with increasing summed Gleason pattern scores (p = 0.15). The probability of remaining a complete responder decreased with increasing stage (p = 0.008) but not with increasing Gleason score (p = 0.14). Increasing pre-treatment PSA correlated with clinical failure (p = 0.01) and chemical failure (p = 0.006). Of the patients with a pre-treatment PSA level of less than 4 times the upper limits of normal 83% remained as complete responders compared to 30% of those with a higher pre-treatment PSA (p = 0.0002). The return of PSA levels to the normal range within 6 months after treatment was strongly correlated with a favorable outcome when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. The status at last followup of patients who had a normal PSA level at 6 months versus those with an elevated PSA level 6 months after treatment is 94% versus 8% for complete responders (p = 0.0001), 0% versus 60% for clinical failures (p = 0.002) and 6% versus 32% for chemical failures (p = 0.14). Similar results occurred when analyzing outcomes in relationship to PSA normalization within 12 months after treatment (p = 0.001 for clinical failures, p = 0.02 for chemical failures and p = 0.001 for complete responders). We conclude that the pre-treatment level of PSA is an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients treated with primary radiation therapy, and that the failure of PSA to return to the normal range within 1 year after completion of treatment identifies a group of patients at high risk for tumor recurrence.\r"

Clinical Mayo grade 1 was never associated with extracapsular disease but 60% of those with grade 3 or higher tumor did have extracapsular disease. Over-all survival was comparable to the expected survival. Clinical stage A2 cancer was associated with a significantly higher progression rate (when prostate specific antigen values were considered, p = 0.0011) and cancer death rate (p less than 0.045) than stage A1 disease, whereas pathological stage was not significantly related to disease outcome, possibly because of the use of adjuvant treatment (hormonal or radiation) for some patients with pathological stage C or higher disease. The vagaries of clinical staging associated with stage A disease, as well as the previously documented progression on long-term followup (8 to 10 years) in younger (60 years old or less) patients with stage A1 prostate cancer make radical prostatectomy with its limited morbidity an acceptable treatment choice.\r"

Although most stages A2 and B tumors were larger, there was overlap among all stages. Transurethral resection tumor volume, per cent and grade were not statistically correlated with either radical prostatectomy residual tumor volume, or whether tumor was classified as minimal or substantial. Gleason sum 2 to 4 versus 5 to 7 tumor on transurethral resection showed no difference in predicting radical prostatectomy residual tumor or minimal versus substantial tumor status. Because 20% of all stage A1 cancers have substantial tumor at radical prostatectomy unpredictable by transurethral resection, radical prostatectomy remains an option for young men with stage A1 prostate cancer.\r"

The relative efficacy of serum PAP and PSA for predicting recurrence of the disease was evaluated by 2 statistical methods at the time of progression as well as 6 and 12 months before clinical relapse of disease using optimized cut-off values of 2.0 and 4.0 micrograms/l. for serum PAP and PSA, respectively. At the time of progression the sensitivity (plus or minus standard deviation) of the 2 tests was estimated at 61.1 +/- 3.2% and 86.7 +/- 3.1% for PAP and PSA, respectively, while the specificity (plus or minus standard deviation) was calculated at respective values of 79.6 +/- 1.3% and 92.4 +/- 4.1%. Receiver operating characteristic analysis disclosed a greater accuracy for PSA at 89.2 +/- 1.7% versus 78.7 +/- 1.6% (plus or minus standard deviation) for PAP. The somewhat lower positive predictive value of the PSA test (81.4% versus 89.6%) is more than compensated by its superior negative predictive value (92.4% versus 79.6%). The present data also show that serum PSA measurements are superior to those of serum PAP for predicting disease recurrence in stages C and D prostate cancer patients treated by combination endocrine therapy and they indicate that measurement of serum PAP does not add significantly to single measurement of serum PSA alone.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the characteristics of transition zone and peripheral zone prostate cancer, we examined a series of 42 stage A and 54 stage B radical prostatectomy specimens with particular attention to the number of separate foci of cancer, zone of origin, volume and grade of each focus, and presence of severe intraductal dysplasia (high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), extra-capsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion associated with cancer in each zone. We found that there were fundamental differences between transition zone and peripheral zone cancers, and that the features that characterize these tumors were apparent in stages A and B disease. Although the total tumor burden was similar in stages A (3.98 cc) and B (4.56 cc) disease, stage A cancer tended to be multifocal (3.1 tumors per prostate) and more diffuse. While 81% of stage A prostate specimens contained a tumor of transition zone origin and 93% had cancer of peripheral zone origin, transurethral resection of the prostate sampled a transition zone cancer in 77% and a peripheral zone cancer in 31% (8% had both types). Stage B cancer tended to be more focal (2.3 cancers per prostate). All stage B prostate specimens contained a peripheral zone cancer and 43% had a transition zone cancer as well. In only 1 stage B cancer patient was the transition zone tumor the palpable or index cancer. In stages A and B disease, peripheral zone tumors were less well differentiated (median Gleason sum 6 and 7) than transition zone tumors (5 and 5, respectively) and more likely to extend through the capsule (44% versus 11%). Seminal vesicle invasion arose from 19% of the peripheral zone but none of the transition zone cancers. Peripheral zone tumors were almost always (93%) associated with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, while none of the transition zone cancers was so associated. For peripheral zone disease there was a moderate correlation between volume and grade (tau = 0.46, p less than 0.001) so that the larger the tumor the higher the Gleason sum but within transition zone disease this correlation was poor (tau = 0.23) and not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). Extracapsular extension occurred at a smaller volume with peripheral zone cancer (mean 3.86, minimum 0.06 cc) than transition zone cancer (mean 4.98, minimum 0.39 cc). Cancer that arises in the transition zone appears to have a different histogenesis, is associated with more favorable pathological features and may have less malignant potential than tumors that arise in the peripheral zone.\r"

Tissues prepared as serial histological sections were examined and appropriate specimens were reconstructed. The formation of the bulbar and spongy urethra occurred by proliferation of mesenchyme underlying the epithelium of the urethral folds, causing the creation of a tubular urethra by epithelial fusion in the ventral midline. The tubular urethra becomes invested by mesenchyme, the future corpus spongiosum. This process of fusion of the urethral folds extends to the glans penis. At this period of development the glans contains the urethral plate, a lamina of epithelium lacking a lumen. The mechanism of the subsequent connection of the spongy urethra to the canalized urethral plate has been the point of controversy. Our observations support the idea that 3 processes must act in synchrony to produce successful completion of the anterior urethra: 1) the prepuce forms by overgrowing the glans due to proliferation of the penile skin and subcutaneous tissues, and in so doing it continues the progression of closure of the urethral folds into the glans and forms the frenulum by its fusion on the ventral aspect, 2) the mesenchyme surrounding the prolongation of the urethra fuses with the mesenchyme of the glans, which before this time had existed as a mesenchymal structure distinct from the corpus spongiosum or corpus cavernosum and 3) the epithelium of the urethral plate within the glans, which underlies the epithelial tag, becomes canalized and develops continuity with the lumen of the spongy urethra.\r"

Postnatally, diagnosis was multicystic dysplastic kidney in 2 patients and a simple renal cyst in 4. The remaining 2 neonates had obstructive uropathy. Finally, of 13 neonates with a prenatal suspicion of anatomical-echo-structural abnormalities a definitive abnormality could be established in only 8. The predictive value of prenatal echography positive for obstructive uropathy was 34.6%.\r"

Evaluation of these 158 patients revealed 24 with vesicoureteral reflux, 7 with duplicated systems (2 of which showed reflux), 1 with the syndrome of Fraley, 1 with pyelectasis and 5 with mild hydronephrosis (3 secondary to reflux and 2 with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scans considered to be nonobstructed). There was no incidence of significant obstructive uropathy that had been missed by the previous prenatal sonography and that surfaced subsequently to cause morbidity in this series. The principal disorder of the urinary tract that may fail prenatal investigation is vesicoureteral reflux.\r"

A series of feasibility studies in 21 canine prostate glands was performed with a follow-up time to 3 months. Results indicate that the Nd:YAG laser in the 20 to 40 W range at a pull rate of approximately 1 mm. per second is an effective means of removing substantial amounts of canine benign prostatic hyperplasia. Transurethral ultrasonography was a reliable means of identifying essential landmarks and of controlling the laser. Prostatectomy by laser coagulation necrosis resulted in no bleeding or postoperative obstruction. Intraoperative irrigation fluids were not required, eliminating systemic volume related problems.\r"

Inbred SCID mice were kept in isolated cages and 2 x 10(7) cells of KU-7, an established bladder carcinoma cell line, were inoculated in the subcutaneous tissue of the flank region of six SCID mice. Athymic nude mice were inoculated by the same method and served as the controls. The KU-7 cells were taken within 14 days in the injected region in all six SCID mice, while in only five out of eight nude mice. Tumors subsequently formed at the site of inoculation in these mice were confirmed to be transitional cell carcinomas histologically and intra-abdominal metastases were noted in two SCID mice. We conclude that SCID mice provide an ideal in vivo model for experimental studies of human urologic malignant tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Proteus mirabilis biofilm formation, struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H2O) crystal formation and dissolution in an artificial urine mixture were monitored using computer-enhanced microscopy (CEM) and a 1 x 3 mm. glass flow cell. Image analysis showed that P. mirabilis biofilm formation did not occur to any extent at macroenvironment flow rates greater than two mL/h (equivalent to a microenvironment flow rate of less than 5 microns./sec). Essentially, cells attached to glass surfaces, grew slowly and divided. Daughter cells were generally released directly into the medium where they could then presumably colonize other regions. Microcolonies formed by the adhesion of aggregates of cells from the medium, and over time grew into biofilms. Struvite crystallization due to urease activity and pH elevation above neutrality, was preceded by the deposition of organic matter on the glass surface, followed by the appearance of a number of tiny (one to two microns.) crystals. Crystals forming within a biofilm at low dilution rates took on a characteristic twinned or \"X-shaped\" appearance (crystal habit) indicative of a rapid growth rate. Those forming outside the biofilm took on a more tabular appearance reflecting their slower growth. When the macroenvironment flow rate of artificial urine (initial pH 5.8) in the glass flow cell was increased from two mL/h to four mL/h, struvite crystals not associated with biofilms dissolved within five to 10 min. Crystals entrapped within the P. mirabilis biofilm withstood flow rates up to 200 mL/h presumably due to the maintenance of an alkaline Mg-saturated microenvironment within the biofilm. These observations may suggest a mechanism by which struvite calculi can grow in spite of neutral or acidic urine pH and resist mild acidification therapy.\r"

The experimental apparatus built by us was adapted from a lithotripter designed for clinical use. For the present studies we used the R3327-AT1 Dunning prostate tumor growing s.c. in the thigh of Copenhagen rats. The treatments consisted of four groups of eight animals each who received 500 or 2000 pulses at 1 or 5 Hz. Sham-treated tumor bearing animals served as controls (n = 11). During each PHEUS treatment, petechial bleeding of the skin at the point of entry and exit of sound appeared. Sonication at a repetition rate of five Hz seemed to induce more macroscopic damage in terms of hematomas and skin effects. The cytotoxic effects of PHEUS to tumor tissue were sufficient to induce a significant delay (p less than 0.05) in tumor growth but no clear-cut dose relationship was established. Histological studies revealed widespread early rupture of the fine vasculature with extravasation of erythrocytes. By 72 hr., in PHEUS treated tumors, a large necrosis was seen within the central zone which was never observed in sham-treated tumors. Our results clearly indicate that PHEUS has a cytotoxic potential. The observation of a rapid onset of hemostasis, stark hemorrhage and necrosis in the treatment field would suggest that vascular damage is an important contributing factor.\r"

  ".W": "Previously established animal models of invasive transitional cell bladder carcinoma and continuous infusion intravesical drug delivery were combined to evaluate the urothelial toxicity and antineoplastic efficacy of continuous intravesical infusion doxorubicin (DOX). Dose-response toxicity experiments studied histologic changes in the rat urinary bladder following urothelial exposure to three different urinary levels of DOX, as a function of the duration of drug infusion. Systemic and local drug absorption, as measured by DOX levels in serum, bladder, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and liver, was measured at intervals during drug administration. In vitro chemosensitivity assays were used to determine tumor sensitivity to DOX. Treatment studies evaluated the impact of 14-day continuous infusion DOX beginning seven days following tumor implantation. No histologically discernable changes in the normal urothelium were noted in bladders of animals receiving continuous intravesicle DOX at mean urinary concentrations of 0.05 micrograms./ml. (n = 5), 0.56 micrograms./ml. (n = 10), and 5.69 micrograms./ml. (n = 10) for periods of up to 14 days. Serum drug concentrations demonstrated a non-significant upward trend following the start of therapy. Significant increases in tissue DOX levels were noted in the bladder and retroperitoneal lymph nodes on chemotherapy days 7 and 14. Mean tissue DOX concentrations in both the bladder and lymph nodes were greater than the IC50 observed in the in vitro sensitivity assay. DOX-treated tumor-bearing animals (n = 17) had a mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) of 0.65 gm. +/- 0.52 gm. compared to an average tumor volume of 1.20 gm. +/- 0.66 gm. in the control group (n = 18) (p = 0.0112). Continuous infusion intraluminal chemotherapy demonstrated a clear cytoreductive effect with minimal local toxicity in this model. Drug tissue levels were observed in regional lymphatic drainage fields as well as the bladder wall. Further study to evaluate this approach as a bladder-sparing alternative to muscle invasive disease is warranted.\r"

With the aim to study which of these virulence markers were independently associated with strains causing infection we performed a multivariate statistical analysis with the data from these strains. The previously proposed virulence factors, expression of type 1 fimbriae and adhesion to HeLa cells were also included in the analysis. P-fimbriae, mannose resistant haemagglutination and the production of haemolysin were, in the multivariate analysis, associated with strains isolated from patients with acute pyelonephritis.\r"

Carbachol, and ACh in combination with 10(-7) M physostigmine, induced increases in phosphoinositide turnover. However, at all the concentrations tested, carbachol was more effective than ACh (plus physostigmine), and at the highest concentration used (10(-4) M), the difference was significant (p less than 0.05). Also in a Ca(2+)-free medium containing the chelator EGTA (10(-4) M), both agonists (10(-4) M) induced small but distinct increases in phosphoinositide breakdown. Carbachol and ACh contracted the detrusor preparations concentration-dependently, and the responses were almost identical when ACh was combined with 10(-7) M physostigmine. In Ca(2+)-free medium the agonists elicited a moderate but concentration-dependent contractile response at high concentrations. The results show that muscarinic receptor agonists stimulate phosphoinositide turnover in the human bladder. Possibly, this effect is coupled to multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes. More studies are required to elucidate to what extent phosphoinositide breakdown participates in the contractile activation of this tissue.\r"

  ".W": "After we had established that the IGFBP-3 gene is expressed in normal human kidney we examined renal adenocarcinoma tissue for alterations of the expression of this gene. For this purpose we prepared poly(A)+ RNA from normal kidney tissue and adjacent renal adenocarcinoma of 18 adult patients and compared the levels of IGFBP-3 mRNA by Northern analysis in both samples. The mean content by densitometry was markedly increased in the carcinoma tissues; in 17 of 18 patients the carcinoma contained significantly more IGFBP-3 mRNA than the normal kidney sample. The highest mRNA levels were found in patients with N2 and N3 lymph node extensions. Comparative Southern analysis of paired samples of four of these patients did not reveal amplification of the gene as the cause of these increased mRNA levels. In one patient, however, we identified a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) present in normal and malignant cellular DNA. This suggests a participation of the IGFBP-3 gene in the development of human renal cell cancer.\r"

No patient had a history or clinical evidence of the adult polycystic disease of the kidney (APDK). Hypothetical models related the pathogenesis of cystic transformation to either obstructive or degenerative factors. Microdissection was performed in four nephrectomy specimens of hemodialyzed patients and a total of 155 nephrons were isolated. The atrophy of the glomeruli has already been described histopathologically but MD demonstrated the existence of nephrons consisting of sclerotic glomeruli and enlarged segments between the atrophic convoluted proximal and distal tubules. Diverticula and cysts were located, above all along the proximal (mainly dilated) convoluted tubules: they were always in continuity with the tubules. Phase contrast microscopy showed a patent lumen in 80% of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, and a regular lining of the cysts. These data support the hypothesis that ACDK is the result of hyperplasia and dilation of remaining nephrons, rather than a result of obstruction and/or fibrosis.\r"

IFN beta ser inhibited growth of anchorage dependent semiconfluent monolayers and anchorage dependent colony formation of both DU-145 and PC-3 in a dose dependent manner but had no effect on LNCaP. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta 1) inhibited proliferation of DU-145 and PC-3 cells in 1% but not 8% fetal calf serum. The combination of TGF beta 1 and IFN beta ser was additive in its effects on growth. Neither epidermal growth factor (EGF) nor transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) reduced the antiproliferative effect of IFN beta ser on these cells. These antiproliferative effects were reproduced in studies on primary epithelial cell cultures derived from prostate specimens with various pathologies. The potential use of IFN beta ser in combination with hormonal therapy to delay the development of hormone refractory tumors is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91374678\r", 
  ".W": "A model of early gestation bladder outlet obstruction and oligohydramnios in the fetal lamb is characterized by small, immature lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia). The current study examines how in utero relief of urinary tract obstruction produced early in gestation modifies pulmonary hypoplasia. Bladder obstruction was created at 60 days gestation in fetal sheep (term = 140 days); 11 fetuses then underwent in utero decompression at 95 to 100 days; six were left obstructed. Five normal fetuses served as controls and two underwent sham obstruction and vesicostomy. All were delivered and sacrificed near term (135 days), the right lung was inflation-fixed and its volume determined. Relative volumes of alveoli, alveolar ducts, and tissue, alveolar surface area, and alveolar numerical density were estimated morphometrically. Kidneys were examined histologically. In all animals persistent bladder obstruction produced oligohydramnios. Bladder obstruction to term produced pulmonary hypoplasia with a mean right lung volume-to-body weight ratio (LV:BW) of 14.3 cc./kg. (normal = 36.4, p less than 0.001). Structural immaturity was evidenced by an airspace fraction of only 57% (normal = 68%, p less than 0.05). Kidneys in these animals were not dysplastic; there was hydronephrosis or evidence of spontaneous urinary decompression. In eight of the 11 animals, decompression improved the LV:BW ratio to 28.4 cc./kg. (vs. obstructed, p less than 0.001; vs normal, p less than 0.05) and normalized maturity. All had increased amniotic fluid at delivery; kidneys in 7/8 animals were normal, and the other had moderate hydronephrosis. One of the 11 animals had normal kidneys, oligohydramnios, immature lungs, but with normal volume. Oligohydramnios was present in the other two of 11 fetuses despite successful decompression and they had markedly dysmorphic kidneys and profoundly hypoplastic and immature lungs (LV:BW 5.1 cc./kg.). Even after 35 days (25% gestation) of obstruction, in utero urinary tract decompression permits better lung growth and maturation than in persistently obstructed animals. The degree of renal damage from obstruction appears to be a critical determinant in the correction of pulmonary hypoplasia.\r"

Previous reports of decreased graft survival and increased complication rates have made surgeons wary of using such kidneys. In 64 kidneys from younger donors transplanted to adult recipients the delayed graft function rate (41 versus 42%), and 2 and 3-year graft survival rates (67 versus 72% and 61 versus 65%, respectively) were similar to those seen with kidneys from adult donors. Kidneys from donors 24 months old or less experienced an 80% rate of graft loss at 1 year. When these kidneys are excluded the 1-year graft survival rate was similar to kidneys from older and younger donors (70 versus 77%). Mean serum creatinine at 1 year was similar in both groups (155 +/- 21 versus 151 +/- 10). Pediatric kidneys except those obtained from donors 2 years old or less are suitable for adult recipients. However, kidneys from very young donors may be more appropriate to pediatric recipients.\r"

To compare the effectiveness of controlled inversion therapy as an adjunctive method to the elimination of calculous fragments, 42 patients who had undergone treatment for lower caliceal stones with a Siemens Lithostar lithotriptor were reviewed. Of the patients 25 had no adjunctive therapy and 17 underwent controlled inversion therapy. The success rate, effectiveness quotient and complication rate were analyzed. Followup consisted of ultrasound and a nephrotomogram 1 day and 1 to 3 months postoperatively. Complete removal of all stone fragments was achieved in 84% of the patients without an adjunctive maneuver and in 64.7% of those treated with controlled inversion therapy. The effectiveness quotient was 72.4% and 35.5%, respectively. The group treated without adjunctive therapy had fewer retreatment sessions and a lower complication rate. There were no complications related to the controlled inversion therapy and patient acceptance was generally enthusiastic. We conclude that controlled inversion therapy did not improve the results of ESWL for lower pole caliceal calculi.\r"

Blood samples obtained before, during and 1 hour after the procedure were cultured and assayed for endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor. Also, culture was done of the urine preoperatively and postoperatively, and the stones when they could be retrieved. There was a temporal relationship among bacteremia, endotoxemia and elevation of tumor necrosis factor. An unexpected finding was peroperative endotoxemia in a significant number of patients with stones. Risk factors noted for postoperative bacteremia, endotoxemia and/or elevation of tumor necrosis factor included preoperative endotoxin level, type of procedure, presence of preoperative bacteriuria and pyuria. With respect to the procedure the risk was greatest after the push-back method and least after cystoscopy (push-back method greater than percutaneous nephrolithotomy/percutaneous nephrostomy greater than Double-J stenting plus ESWL greater than ureterorenoscopy greater than ESWL greater than cystoscopy). If the risk factors are measured preoperatively it may be possible to identify the risk of postoperative bacteremia/endotoxemia and, therefore, septic shock postoperatively. Our patients appear to be a good clinical model to investigate the problems related to septicemia.\r"

The aim of the study was to confirm or rule out the occurrence of vesicoureteral reflux radiologically, and to define its degree in stented patients. During the filling phase of the cystourethrogram, reflux occurred in 19 of the 30 renal units (63%). Of those 19 renal units the reflux was grade 1/4 in 15 (79%), while in 4 (21%) it was of higher grades (2 to 3/4). During the voiding phase of the cystourethrogram reflux was observed in 24 of 30 renal units (80%). Of those 24 renal units reflux was of high grade (2 to 4/4) in 20 (83%), while it was low grade (1/4) in 4 (17%). In the presence of a double pigtail stent the ureteral peristaltic waves were sluggish and averaged 1 to 2 waves per minute in the 15 patients observed fluoroscopically for 1 minute after voiding. We conclude that in the majority of patients with double pigtail ureteral stents vesicoureteral reflux occurs at a low grade during vesical filling and at a high grade during voiding. Also, the stents adversely affect the ureteral peristaltic activities.\r"

The emptying patterns of ureterosigmoidostomy and the modified rectal bladder were also studied by ascending scintigraphy with 99mtechnetium. Evidence was provided that in cases with ureterosigmoidostomy the isotope is distributed throughout the entire colon. These studies proved the role of the colorectal valve in preventing reflux of urine from the rectum to the proximal colon. Consequently, the surface area of colonic mucosa exposed to urine is decreased and the rate of reabsorption is limited.\r"

Whenever vesicoureteral reflux was found or morphological abnormalities were detected on excretory urography (IVP) an isotope renal scan was performed to evaluate the relative renal function. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 13 patients (19.7%): 10 had grades 1 and 2A, and 3 had grade 2B reflux. The number of BCG instillations ranged from 8 to 22. IVPs were normal in 11 patients. In 2 patients mild unilateral dilatation was present before BCG instillations, and this remained unchanged during and after therapy. None of the 13 patients with vesicoureteral reflux had IVP features suggestive of urinary tuberculosis. In 11 patients the refluxing renal systems had normal relative renal function (50 to 55%). Two patients had a decrease to 40% of the relative renal function with normal IVPs, suggesting a nonBCG related cause. We conclude that BCG therapy is safe in patients with minimal reflux.\r"

P-glycoprotein was not detected in the normal adult or pediatric bladder. Bladder specimens from 3 children with a neurogenic bladder revealed enhanced expression (21%, 14% and 4% positivity). Transitional cell carcinoma usually demonstrates low expression at diagnosis (less than 6%), although 3 patients had enhanced initial expression (11%, 12% and 31%). Three patients treated with chemotherapy demonstrated 56%, 76% and 50% expression of MDR-1. Nonmalignant tissue from cystectomy specimens had low expression of MDR-1. The specificity of this system was confirmed with human bladder cell lines. The ability of flow cytometry to detect and quantify the expression of MDR-1 may allow for the early detection of chemotherapy resistance in patients with transitional cell carcinoma treated with systemic and intravesical therapy.\r"

Severe cystoceles develop from weaknesses of the levator sling and pubocervical fasciae resulting in 2 main anatomical changes: a central defect between the pubocervical fasciae, and a sliding herniation of the bladder and urethra (paravaginal defect). We developed a new transvaginal technique for the repair of large cystoceles (grade IV) extending outside of the introitus at rest, which includes repair of the central defect by anterior colporrhaphy, and repair of the paravaginal herniation of the bladder base and bladder neck by a needle suspension of these structures. We report our experience within a 5-year period in the treatment of 51 cases of severe bladder prolapse (grade IV cystoceles), 46 of which required this combined procedure regardless of preoperative stress urinary incontinence status. Five patients underwent anterior colporrhaphy as the only procedure, since they were continent and demonstrated a well supported bladder neck from a previous suspension operation. Other vaginal abnormalities should be repaired simultaneously to provide adequate pelvic floor support.\r"

Another 18 patients with erectile dysfunction served as the control group. The investigation was well tolerated by all patients and no side effects or complications were encountered. Attenuation or even interruption of the contrast medium within the corpus spongiosum on spongiosography clearly revealed the fibrosis in urethral strictures. The extent of scarring was completely independent of the clinical symptoms and urethrographic findings. Accordingly, our decision on the appropriate surgical treatment was based mainly on the results of spongiosography. If used as an additional routine investigation in cases of urethral stricture spongiosography may help to decrease the recurrence rate in the future.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE.--To review our experience with lung transplantation, emphasizing recipient selection, choice of procedure, functional results, and outcome. DESIGN.--Retrospective review of patients who received lung transplants at Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Mo, between July 1, 1988, and January 31, 1991. SETTING.--Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Mo, and Barnes Hospital, a medical school and its affiliated referral hospital, respectively. PATIENTS.--Sixty-nine lung transplant procedures were performed in 66 recipients. Patients with clinically and physiologically severe lung disease were selected according to predetermined guidelines. Underlying diseases in the recipients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome associated with an atrial septal defect, bronchiectasis, eosinophilic granuloma, and lymphangiomyomatosis. INTERVENTION.--Double-lung, bilateral sequential, and single-lung transplantations were performed. Eight patients underwent en bloc double-lung transplantations or a modification of this procedure with separate bronchial anastomoses. Thereafter, the bilateral sequential approach to replacement of both lungs was performed in 26 patients. Thirty-two patients underwent single-lung transplantations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas levels, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and actuarial survival. RESULTS.--Actuarial survival at 1 year for the 66 lung transplant recipients was 79%. Actuarial survival at 1 year was 82% for the bilateral lung transplant recipients and was 90% for the single-lung transplant recipients. In patients with either restrictive or obstructive lung disease, pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas levels improved markedly after lung transplantation. In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger's syndrome, the pulmonary artery pressure decreased and the cardiac index increased into the normal range after single-lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS.--In carefully selected patients with end-stage lung disease, single-lung and bilateral lung transplantations can significantly improve functional capacity, with promising early actuarial survival statistics after 1 year.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE.--To assess the influence of a continuous (basal) morphine infusion as part of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) system on the postoperative analgesic requirement and on recovery parameters following abdominal hysterectomy. DESIGN.--Single-center, randomized, controlled protocol. SETTING.--University medical center. PARTICIPANTS.--A total of 230 adult women were randomly assigned to receive no morphine infusion (control group) or a continuous 0.5-, 1.0-, or 2.0-mg/h morphine infusion. Each patient was able to self-administer supplemental intravenous bolus doses of morphine (1 to 2 mg) using a PCA infuser. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Use of the PCA device, opioid-related side effects, recovery times, and the patients' assessment of pain and sedation on linear visual analog scales were recorded during the 72-hour study period. Follow-up questionnaires were completed by the patients and their health care professionals to assess the overall adequacy of PCA therapy. RESULTS.--Patients who received the 2-mg/h morphine infusions received significantly more opioid medication 9 to 72 hours after their operation than those who received no infusion (control group). The presence of a continuous morphine infusion of 0.5 to 2 mg/h did not significantly decrease the number of patient demands or supplemental bolus doses administered compared with the control group. Overall, 168 (84%) of the 199 patients who completed the 72-hour study were able to achieve adequate analgesia without requiring changes in the PCA regimen or experiencing major side effects. Recovery times and outcome variables were similar in all four groups. CONCLUSION.--The routine use of a continuous opioid infusion in combination with a standard PCA regimen does not improve pain management compared with PCA alone after abdominal hysterectomy.\r"

We investigated the possibility of transforming readily available muscle flaps into vascularized bone grafts of various shapes that could be used as skeletal replacement parts. In a rat experimental model, thigh adductor muscle island flaps were placed inside bivalved silicone rubber molds. Prior to closure of the mold, 18 flaps were injected with osteogenin and coated with demineralized bone matrix. Five flaps served as controls and were injected with the vehicle only, and not coated with demineralized bone matrix. The molds were implanted subcutaneously in the rats' flanks and reopened 10 days later. The control flaps consisted of intact muscle without any evidence of tissue transformation, whereas the flaps treated with osteogenin and demineralized bone matrix were entirely transformed into cancellous bone that matched the exact shape of the mold. Using tissue transformation, we were able to generate in vivo, autogenous, well-perfused bones in the shapes of femoral heads and mandibles.\r"

To investigate the possible role of sperm, this study examined the interaction of cocaine with human spermatozoa. Washed sperm were incubated with tritiated cocaine (6.7 nmol/L) with or without unlabeled cocaine (670 mumol/L), and the samples were filtered and the remaining radioactivity quantitated. The specific binding was optimal at 20 minutes and 23 degrees C. Competition studies with tritiated cocaine (3.4 to 66.6 nmol/L) indicated the presence of approximately 3.6 x 10(3) binding sites per cell, with a high affinity receptor dissociation constant (Kd = 12.6 nmol/L). Cocaine concentrations as high as 670 mumol/L had no detectable effect on either the motility or viability of the cells. These results support the hypothesis that the sperm may act as a vector to transport cocaine into an ovum. This novel mechanism could be involved in the abnormal development of offspring of cocaine-exposed males.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE.--Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines are effective in preventing Haemophilus disease in most children. The reasons why the vaccination fails in some children are unknown. This study investigated host factors in children who developed the disease despite conjugate vaccination. DESIGN, PATIENTS, OUTCOME MEASURES.--A convenience sample of 23 patients in whom Hib disease developed 14 days or more after conjugate vaccination was investigated for the presence of subnormal serum immunoglobulin concentrations and anticapsular antibody responses to Hib disease. We also investigated expression of the Hib idiotype 1 (Hibld-1), a serological marker of a VKII chain that comprises a major portion of the normal variable region repertoire of the antibody response to Hib polysaccharide. The results were compared with those of 149 patients in whom the unconjugated Hib polysaccharide vaccine failed and of 90 unvaccinated patients who developed the disease. RESULTS.--Compared with children in whom the unconjugated polysaccharide vaccination failed, the relative risk of a subnormal serum concentration of IgM, IgA, IgG, and/or IgG2 in the children in whom the conjugate vaccination failed was 4.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 14; P less than .003) and of IgG2 was 22 (95% CI, 3.5 to 146; P less than .001). With the exception of the children with subnormal serum immunoglobulin concentrations, most of the children with conjugate vaccination failure showed normal or high anticapsular antibody responses to the disease, whereas the children with polysaccharide vaccination failure showed impaired responses. The Hibld-1 was expressed by the majority of the children in both vaccination failure groups and of the unvaccinated patients. CONCLUSIONS.--In most patients, vaccination failure is not attributable to lack of expression of the variable region gene encoding Hibld-1. However, children in whom conjugate vaccination has failed frequently have subnormal serum immunoglobulin concentrations and should be evaluated for immunodeficiency.\r"

During the past decade, multipoint computerized electrophysiological mapping systems were used to map both experimental and human atrial fibrillation. On the basis of these studies, a new surgical procedure was developed for atrial fibrillation. Between September 25, 1987, and July 1, 1991, this procedure was applied in 22 patients with paroxysmal atrial flutter (n = 2), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (n = 11), or chronic atrial fibrillation (n = 9) of 2 to 21 years' duration. All patients were refractory to all antiarrhythmic medications, and each patient failed to receive the desired therapeutic benefits of an average of five drugs administered preoperatively. There were no operative deaths and all perioperative morbidity resolved. All 22 patients have been successfully treated for atrial fibrillation with surgery alone. Three patients developed one late isolated episode of atrial flutter at 5, 6, and 15 months postoperatively, and each of these patient's symptoms is now controlled by a single antiarrhythmic drug. Preservation of atrial transport function has been documented in all patients postoperatively, and all have experienced marked clinical improvement.\r"

In contrast, only one patient (2%) of 43 without acute invasive amebiasis had antibodies to SREHP. The predictive value of a positive test for anti-SREHP antibodies in the detection of acute invasive amebiasis was most marked when analyzed in the patients from Durban, where 11 (92%) of 12 patients who were seropositive for SREHP had acute invasive amebiasis vs 17 (65%) of 26 patients who had a positive serologic diagnosis as determined by agar gel diffusion. The use of a serologic test based on the recombinant SREHP fusion protein may be a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of acute invasive amebiasis in endemic regions.\r"

DESIGN.--Cohort study. The accuracy of ultrasonographic results was assessed in relation to final diagnoses established by surgery or by composite clinical data and follow-up. SETTING.--Metropolitan, pediatric hospital; ambulatory and hospitalized patients. PATIENTS.--Consecutive sample of 178 pediatric patients who were referred for ultrasonography because of suspected acute appendicitis, but in whom the diagnosis could not be definitively established by clinical criteria. RESULTS.--Appendicitis was proven at surgery in 38 patients. Ultrasonography demonstrated the findings of appendicitis (noncompressible appendix with or without concomitant periappendiceal fluid collection or appendicolith) in 31 (82%) of these patients. Among the 140 children without appendicitis, other specific diagnoses were established by clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings in 58 patients (including gynecologic diseases in 25, gastrointestinal tract abnormalities in 17, renal diseases in six, and extra-abdominal disease in 10). Ultrasonography aided in the diagnosis of other conditions in 34 (59%) of these 58 patients. No definitive clinical diagnosis was established in the remaining 82 patients. There were no false-positive results of ultrasonography. CONCLUSION.--Approximately half of children referred for suspected appendicitis will have a final diagnosis of abdominal pain of unknown origin. In the remainder, ultrasonography is useful, both to establish the diagnosis of appendicitis and to aid in diagnosing other causes of acute abdominal pain.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the role of basal insulin concentration on leucine kinetics (determined by means of 1-[13C]leucine) and energy metabolism (determined by indirect calorimetry) in eight septic patients by reducing insulin (and glucagon) secretion by somatostatin infusion. Basal glucagon concentration was elevated (744 +/- 381 pg/mL), and insulin concentration was normal (10 +/- 4 microU/mL). Basal resting energy expenditure (REE) was 151 +/- 8% that of predicted basal energy expenditure, and leucine appearance (Ra), oxidation, and nonoxidative disposal rates were all elevated above the normal ranges. Somatostatin infusion reduced insulin concentration by 52% and glucagon concentration by 64%. This resulted in a significant increase in the rate of leucine oxidation from 0.96 +/- 0.08 to 1.18 +/- 0.14 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.01), and nonoxidative leucine disposal decreased from 2.95 +/- 0.18 to 2.67 +/- 0.17 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.01). Somatostatin infusion also caused significant increases in REE and fat oxidation from 1310 +/- 100 to 1505 +/- 128 kcal/m2/day (p less than 0.05) and from 1.72 +/- 0.24 to 2.41 +/- 0.41 mg/kg/min, respectively, and a slight decrease of carbohydrate oxidation from 1.51 +/- 0.49 to 1.31 +/- 0.49 mg/kg/min. These metabolic responses can be attributed to the reduction in insulin concentration, because they are in the opposite direction of changes that would occur as a consequence of a reduction in glucagon concentration. We conclude that the basal insulin plays an important role in attenuating net protein loss and energy expenditure.\r"

In 22 patients, the CVC was removed because of clinical assessment of catheter sepsis expressed by the staff prior to the removal. For each CVC removal, peripheral blood (qualitative method), hub, and CVC tip (quantitative method) cultures were performed. Clinical sepsis (disappearance of fever after CVC removal) was observed in 13 patients, microbiologic \"sepsis\" (identification of the same microorganisms on the CVC tip and in the peripheral blood) in seven patients, and clinical and/or microbiologic sepsis in 16 patients. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the microorganism most frequently identified. Hub culture was negative in 48% and positive for a low number and a high number of colonies in 35% and 17%, respectively. The predictive value of hub culture was 96% when testing negative and 8% and 37% (p = 3 x 10(-3)) when testing positive for a low and a high number of colonies, respectively. Predictive values of clinical assessment were 55% if positive and 97% if negative. Combining hub cultures and clinical assessment, the risk of sepsis varied from 2% with both evaluations negative to 89% in the case of positive clinical assessment associated with positive high-count hub. Inasmuch as the CVCs used have a disposable hub, it is possible to have an accurate diagnosis of CVC sepsis without removing the CVC.\r"

  ".W": "The reliability of resting energy expenditure (REE) measurements by indirect calorimetry with a ventilated hood was investigated in 50 healthy controls and 10 patients with liver cirrhosis. In each subject basal energy expenditure (BEE) was determined once and REE three times (morning REE1, noon REE2, afternoon REE3). In controls and patients the first 5-minute BEE and first 5-minute REE (controls also second 5-minute REE) were higher than in the remainder of the 30-minute recording. Only the last 20 minutes of recordings were used to calculate BEE (1645 +/- 315, mean +/- SD, in kilocalories per day), REE1 (1880 +/- 365), REE2 (1782 +/- 384), and REE3 (1775 +/- 316) in controls, and in cirrhotics: BEE (1530 +/- 235), REE1 (1714 +/- 267), REE2 (1715 +/- 238), and REE3 (1779 +/- 275). REE was higher than BEE in controls and cirrhotics (p less than 0.05). The REE variation coefficient was 5 +/- 3% in controls and 5 +/- 2% in cirrhotics. No systematic difference between REE1, REE2, and REE3 was found. Energy expenditure predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation differed up to 21% from measured BEE in individual controls; group mean BEE, however, was correctly predicted. In cirrhotics differences between measured and predicted BEE up to 26% occurred, while measured BEE was higher than predicted BEE (p = 0.06). It is concluded that REE can be reliably assessed by indirect calorimetry with a ventilated hood system in controls and patients at any time of the day, when values obtained in the first 10 minutes are deleted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The use of serum visceral protein concentrations as predictors of nitrogen balance was assessed during the first 4 weeks following thermal injury. The correlation between nitrogen balance and serum albumin was not significant. Statistically significant correlations were found between nitrogen balance and serum prealbumin, retinol-binding protein, and transferrin. However, even the best correlation (retinol-binding protein, r = 0.388) was too weak to permit prediction of nitrogen balance on the basis of the visceral protein concentration. The correlation between change in direction of nitrogen balance and change in direction of protein concentration over time showed all four visceral proteins to be poor predictors of change in nitrogen balance. The efficiency was less than 50% for each visceral protein. Stepwise multiple regression analysis performed to determine which indices were most closely correlated with nitrogen balance showed that a calculation using readily available information (nitrogen intake, postburn day, percent total body surface burned, and age) provided better prediction of nitrogen balance (r = 0.765) than any of the visceral protein concentrations. In view of these findings, measurement of serum visceral protein concentrations to monitor adequacy of nutritional support seems an unwarranted expense in patients with thermal injury.\r"

There is a marked correlation between low albumin levels and the incidence of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that hypoalbuminemia is a common finding among hospitalized patients. This results from alterations in the catabolic or anabolic rates, losses of albumin, or redistribution between the various fluid compartments of the body. Somewhat less well defined than the role of albumin as a prognostic indicator is its role in compounding pathophysiology. Hypoalbuminemia is known to be associated with delayed wound healing. The hypoalbuminemic state interferes with the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. Qualitative changes in the albumin molecule which occur in renal disease may damage the nephron. Low serum albumin levels may adversely affect the coagulation system. Further investigation into the role of albumin in pathophysiology is warranted.\r"

Three episodes of catheter dislodgement occurred in adolescents or young adults with cystic fibrosis, who may constitute a particularly high-risk group. Dislodgement in two patients was asymptomatic. These case suggest that patients with frequent or severe paroxysms of increased intrathoracic pressure may be at higher risk of catheter dislodgement. Since dislodgement may be initially asymptomatic and can cause serious complications, a high index of suspicion for dislodgement in patients with silastic central venous catheters and coughing paroxysms is advised.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the mechanism of observed differences in vasoreactivity in norepinephrine-induced (NE) and renal artery clamp (RAC) models of ischemic acute renal failure (ARF), induction renal blood flow (RBF) was measured and vascular reactivity examined one week thereafter in NE- and RAC-ARF rat kidneys that had identical levels of renal dysfunction. Morphology also was compared at 48 hours and one week. In NE-ARF, RBF was 14% during 90 minutes of induction and by 60 minutes post-NE infusion was only 18% of baseline. In contrast, in RAC-ARF RBF was effectively 0 for 75 minutes but returned to 95% of baseline by 60 minutes after clamp release. At one week there was a paradoxical increase in renovascular resistance (RVR) to renal perfusion pressure (RPP) reduction in the autoregulatory range and an augmented vasoconstriction to renal nerve stimulation (RNS) in NE-ARF, but no change in RVR and minimal reduction in RBF to these same respective stimuli in RAC-ARF (both different at P less than 0.001). NE-ARF were more sensitive to intrarenal norepinephrine than RAC-ARF kidneys (P less than 0.001). Neither NE- nor RAC-ARF kidneys responded to endothelium-dependent acetylcholine (ACh). Vasodilation to endothelium-independent prostacyclin (PGI2) in NE- was similar to sham-ARF, but there was an attenuated response in RAC-ARF kidneys (P less than 0.001). Morphology at 48 hours showed smooth muscle necrosis in half of the resistance vessels in RAC- but in less than 10% of those in NE-ARF. Except for a slightly greater frequency of tubular casts at 48 hours in RAC-ARF, tubular injury was indistinguishable. It is concluded that NE-ARF has evidence of a predominant functional endothelial vascular injury while RAC-ARF has both morphologic and functional evidence of a predominant smooth muscle injury. Differences in vascular injury between the two models, at least in part, may be the consequence of differences in severity of initial ischemia and/or the rates of recovery of RBF; however, an additional or separate toxic effect of infused NE cannot be excluded.\r"

SGP-2 expression has been shown to demarcate mammalian cells undergoing apoptosis. Using in situ hybridization, the cellular localization of SGP-2 expression in the obstructed kidney was determined as a means to study the various phases involved in the progression of hydronephrosis. Within 30 minutes of obstruction, SGP-2 mRNA expression was localized to the adventitial layers of the hilar arteries and intrarenal arterioles. Increasing time of obstruction resulted in the notable absence or depletion of this layer. In addition, the pattern of SGP-2 expression changed with time to the collecting ducts and distal tubules. This study identifies the vascular support tissue of the kidney as the initial site of reaction and potential cell death following ureteral obstruction. We believe that this observation may be of importance in explaining the early alterations in blood flow associated with hydronephrosis.\r"

Both drugs reduced systemic blood pressure, however, blood pressure tended to be greater in rats given nifedipine than in those on enalapril. After six months, proteinuria and the relevance of glomerula sclerosis were significantly reduced in the two treated groups compared to values observed in untreated SHR. Kidney weight was also reduced by therapy, suggesting that both enalapril and nifedipine inhibited compensatory kidney growth. Micropuncture studies performed in similarly treated groups of rats, but at 11 weeks of age, revealed that PGC was elevated in untreated UNX SHR and reduced by both nifedipine and enalapril. These findings support the hypothesis that glomerular hypertension and renal hypertrophy are important risk factors for glomerular injury. They suggest that calcium blockers are as effective as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing progressive kidney damage.\r"

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that actomyosin was a major protein component in the extract of mesangial cells. By Western blot, tropomyosin, caldesmon, alpha-actinin, and vinculin were recognized in mesangial cells. The molecular masses of alpha-actinin and vinculin were the same as aortic smooth muscle. Mesangial cells contained five tropomyosin isoforms: TM-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5. TM-1 was present as a major isoform in mesangial cells, and it had an immunological cross reactivity with beta-tropomyosin of aortic smooth muscle. On the other hand, the molecular mass of caldesmon was similar to dermal fibroblasts, and differed from aortic smooth muscle. Immunofluorescent studies showed that the staining patterns of tropomyosin and caldesmon between cultured mesangial cells and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells were somewhat different. From these results, we conclude that mesangial cells abound in contractile proteins, and that the compositions of these proteins are similar to those of aortic smooth muscle with minor differences. Thus, this study appears to biochemically support a hypothesis that mesangial cells are derived from vascular smooth muscle cells, but with a minor modification in their evolution.\r"

In the present study 10-week-old obese Zucker rats were pair fed regular chow or chow containing either 20% sunflower oil rich in n-6 PUFA, fish oil rich in n-3 PUFA, coconut oil medium-chain saturated fatty acid, or beef tallow long-chain saturated fatty acid. At 34 weeks of age there were comparable reductions in albuminuria, mesangial matrix expansion, and glomerulosclerosis in the fish oil and sunflower oil groups. While both fish oil and sunflower oil reduced serum triglycerides, and improved the composition of triglyceride-enriched lipoproteins, only fish oil decreased serum cholesterol. The effect of the dietary fatty acid supplementation on fatty acid profiles were similar in isolated glomeruli and cortical tissue. In general, the amelioration in injury in the fish oil and sunflower oil fed rats was most closely linked to glomerular levels of PUFA, either n-6 or n-3. These data suggest that hyperlipidemia and abnormalities in tissue FA are closely linked, and that dietary supplementation with PUFA may ameliorate chronic, progressive renal injury.\r"

In young animals, body weights and amounts of food consumed were measured at two-day intervals, beginning at 29 days of age. Average food intake and food efficiency were calculated. Animals were treated with cortisone (CORT, 5 mg/rat/day, s.c.) or saline (SAL) for eight days between 37 and 44 days. Growth hormone (GH) release by dispersed pituitary cells in response to nine concentrations of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) were tested by in vitro perifusion at 45 and 73 days. As previously shown, CORT caused a cessation of growth during the treatment period, and body weight failed to catch up. Food efficiency was decreased during CORT treatment. All parameters of in vitro GH release including basal GH secretory rate, overall GH response to GHRH, and the GHRH concentration-response curves were significantly increased by CORT in the 45-day-old animals. An age-related increase in GH release was also observed between the 45 and 73 day saline-treated animals. These results support the hypothesis that glucocorticoids inhibit growth by induction of changes in food metabolism and GH secretion. The effect on the pituitary gland itself paradoxically involves an increase in GH secretory capacity in response to GHRH.\r"

Sepharose CL-4B chromatography revealed a major high molecular weight PG (Mr greater than 2.5 x 10(6], and a relative increase in the chondroitinase-ABC sensitive PGs. The media PGs were of relatively smaller size. Immunoprecipitation experiments with [35S]-methionine-labeled tissues and immunofluorescent studies revealed a significant decrease of PGs in metanephric tissues, while type IV collagen and laminin were relatively unaffected. Significant glomerular changes included failure in differentiation of the visceral epithelial foot processes, formation of villi and in maturation of glomerular basement membrane. The latter was seen as fragments of extracellular matrices interspersed among undifferentiated podocytes and had reduced staining with ruthenium red--a dye marker for the PGs. This deficiency of PGs was confirmed by electron microscopic autoradiography, where a reduction in the number of silver grains was observed. The fact that the PAN-induced cellular and extracellular alterations were associated with perturbances in biosynthesis of PGs, suggests that the morphogenetic regulators, that is, PGs play a vital role in various differentiation processes involved during metanephric development.\r"
